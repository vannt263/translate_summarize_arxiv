    "<S> we attempt to describe the interplay of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in qcd by using the string model . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that in the quasi - abelian picture of confinement based on the condensation of magnetic monopoles and the dual meissner effect , the worldsheet dynamics of the confining string can be effectively described by the @xmath0 dimensional massless electrodynamics , which is exactly soluble . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse plane distribution of the chromoelectric field stretched between the quark and antiquark sources can then be attributed to the fluctuations in the position of the string . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the chiral condensate in the string on the ( chromo-)electric field can be evaluated analytically , and is determined by the chiral anomaly and the @xmath1-vacuum structure . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our picture allows to predict the distribution of the chiral condensate in the plane transverse to the axis connecting the quark and antiquark . </S>",
    "<S> this prediction is compared to the lattice qcd results ; a good agreement is found .    </S>",
    "<S> the interplay of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in qcd is among the most prominent unsolved problems in modern physics . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , none of the two phenomena have been understood from the first principles so far . </S>",
    "<S> it thus may be useful to address a much more modest problem of understanding how the chiral symmetry breaking can occur once the presence of a confining background is _ assumed _ ; this will be the subject of our paper . </S>",
    "<S> 0.3 cm we consider the mechanism of confinement based on the dual meissner effect , as originally proposed by nambu and mandelstam @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> seiberg and witten @xcite have demonstrated that this scenario is realized in @xmath2 supersymmetric yang - mills theory , where magnetic monopoles at strong coupling become massless and condense . the resulting low - energy effective theory takes the form of an abelian gauge theory with matter . </S>",
    "<S> a small deformation of the @xmath2 theory down to @xmath3 then leads to the emergence of the abelian string that confines electric charges @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> 0.3 cm    the confinement mechanism in qcd may be different and can involve non - abelian strings ( for a recent review , see @xcite ) . nevertheless , the quasi - abelian picture based on the dual meissner effect is supported by a number of lattice qcd studies , e.g. @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most ( but not all  see @xcite ) of these studies rely on the use of a specific gauge  so - called  maximal abelian projection `` . </S>",
    "<S> let us summarize the arguments justifying this quasi - abelian approach . </S>",
    "<S> 0.3 cm the basic observation is that the symmetry group @xmath4 of non - abelian gauge theories is compact , i.e. it is a topological group with a compact topology ( for example , a sphere for @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the perturbation theory ignores this underlying topology , and this is a source of the disconnect that currently exists between the perturbative and non - perturbative approaches to qcd @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the gauge fixing condition is at the root of the problem , since in general it leads to the emergence of unphysical propagating modes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these unphysical modes can be removed in so - called ' ' non - propagating `` or ' ' unitary \" gauges ; this leads to the emergence of singularities in space - time , which have a physical meaning @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in the abelian higgs theory , this singularity describes a string - like magnetic vortex ; the dynamics along the vortex line is effectively @xmath6 dimensional . </S>",
    "<S> the topological structure of the vortex is a consequence of the compact topology of the @xmath7 gauge group . </S>",
    "<S> 0.3 cm for nonabelian gauge theories , the approach proposed in @xcite is the following : first , fix the nonabelian part of the gauge redundancy by reducing the gauge symmetry @xmath4 to that of the maximal abelian subgroup @xmath8 ; we thus get the theory with @xmath9 different kinds of electric charges . </S>",
    "<S> the non - propagating gauge condition leads to point - like singularities in 3d space that are interpreted as magnetic monopoles with respect to @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the compactness of @xmath10 is essential for this argument ; for example in qcd the magnetic monopoles realize the map @xmath11 ^ 2 ) = z_2 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> if these magnetic monopoles condense in the vacuum , they repel the electric fields and lead to the confinement of electric charges by means of the dual meissner effect . </S>",
    "<S> the electric - magnetic duality plays an important role here ; indeed , it is manifest in the seiberg - witten approach @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the point - like singularities emerge only when the maximal abelian subgroup @xmath8 is unbroken ; this is called the  abelian projection \" of @xmath4 @xcite . 0.3 cm assuming this scenario for qcd , the magnetic monopoles condense in the vacuum , leading to the emergence of confining abelian electric flux tubes connecting quarks and antiquarks . </S>",
    "<S> these flux tubes are dual analogs of abrikosov - nilesen - olesen ( ano ) vortices in type ii superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that when a theory possesses charged massless chiral fermions , they can be localized within the cores of ano vortices that contain magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the dynamics of these localized fermions is described by an effective @xmath6 dimensional theory , see e.g. @xcite  the fermions can freely propagate along the vortex but can not escape into the bulk of a superconductor . in the dual meissner picture of confinement , </S>",
    "<S> the qcd string is a dual ano vertex containing the abelian electric field . </S>",
    "<S> 0.3 cm just like in the original ano vertex , the core of a confining qcd string can contain localized charged chiral fermions , and their dynamics is described by an effective @xmath6 dimensional theory . </S>",
    "<S> the abelian gauge theory with massless fermions in @xmath6 dimensions is well known  it is the schwinger model with the lagrangean given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the coupling constant with the dimension of mass . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is exactly soluble and possesses confinement , chiral symmetry breaking , axial anomaly , and the periodic @xmath1-vacuum @xcite . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , it allows a computation of the chiral condensate as a function of electric field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> namely , the presence of the background electric field suppresses the magnitude of the chiral condensate , with a periodic dependence that originates from the @xmath1-vacuum of the theory . </S>",
    "<S> 0.3 cm the string breaking in schwinger model results from the periodic @xmath1 dependence , since the electric field in @xmath6 dimensions plays the role of @xmath14 angle , creating the imbalance between the left- and right - moving chiral fermions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is tempting to speculate that in full @xmath15 dual meissner picture the image of this string breaking process involves the witten effect @xcite : magnetic monopoles at finite @xmath1 acquire an electric charge , which allows them to screen the confining potential  </S>",
    "<S> see @xcite for a specific realization of this scenario for nonabelian strings in dense qcd . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting dyon would thus behave as a fermion ( or as a bosonic kink in the bosonized description of the schwinger model ) , and may play the role of the produced quark . </S>",
    "<S> 0.3 cm    long time ago it was proposed to consider the schwinger model as an effective theory of non - perturbative string fragmentation @xcite , see also @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , we have revisited this approach by finding an explicit exact solution for the theory coupled to external fast quark sources @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the model provides a reasonably good description of the data on jet fragmentation in @xmath16 annihilation , multiparticle production in @xmath17 collisions , and the jet quenching in quark - gluon plasma . </S>",
    "<S> 0.3 cm we have also identified the phenomenon of coherent coupled oscillations of chiral and vector charges in this theory @xcite , which can be viewed as a @xmath6 analog of the  chiral magnetic wave \" @xcite in @xmath15 dimensions  indeed , both excitations are driven by the chiral anomaly , and the chiral magnetic wave is described by a @xmath6 theory in the limit of a strong magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> we argued that this coherent oscillation of vector ( electric ) charge acts as an intense source of soft photon production , and may explain the ubiquitous enhancement of soft photons observed in hadronic processes @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> 0.3 cm    in lattice qcd studies , the observation of the electric flux tube between color charges presents a clear indication of confinement . </S>",
    "<S> it has been observed that the transverse profile of the electric field resembles that of ano vortex @xcite . recently a measurement of the chiral condensate in the presence of static charge was performed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the chiral condensate was found to be suppressed around the string , which indicates a partial restoration of chiral symmetry in the confining background . </S>",
    "<S> 0.3 cm we will now argue that this partial restoration of chiral symmetry can be described if one assumes the presence of a  </S>",
    "<S> thin \" @xmath6 dimensional string with a position fluctuating in the transverse plane , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : stringfluctuation ] .        </S>",
    "<S> 0.3 cm let us denote the physical @xmath15 dimensional electric field measured on the lattice by @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is the coordinate in the plane transverse to the flux ) and the electric field along the thin string in the @xmath6 description by @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that both descriptions of the string should yield the same string tension , so the energy per unit length of the string should be equal : @xmath21 let us now introduce @xmath22 as the probability for finding the thin string in the transverse plane at a position @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> from the condition ( [ match ] ) , we can constrain this probability distribution : @xmath23 since @xmath24 the requirement is fulfilled . 0.3 </S>",
    "<S> cm    now we can use the lattice data on the distribution of electric field to extract the probability distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the knowledge of the dependence of the chiral condensate in the @xmath0 dimensional theory on the electric field together with the probability distribution will then allow us to predict the distribution of the chiral condensate around the confining flux tube . </S>",
    "<S> 0.3 cm    the schwinger model is exactly soluble is by bosonization @xcite : @xmath25 using these relations in the original lagrangian , it can be shown that the original massless fermionic theory is equivalent to the theory of a free massive scalar @xmath26 the expression for the chiral condensate in terms of the scalar field is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the euler number . </S>",
    "<S> 0.3 cm    the chiral condensate can be evaluated through the feynman - hellmann theorem by differentiating the energy of the ground state in the presence of an electric field @xmath20 with respect to the fermion mass @xmath29 , in the chiral limit @xmath30 @xcite : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the longitudinal coordinate . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the value of the condensate is constant along the string and depends only on the value of the background electric field . </S>",
    "<S> 0.3 cm    let us now assume that the thin string fluctuates in the transverse plane ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) , and the corresponding probability distribution is @xmath22 normalized by ( [ eq : norm ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the effective radius of the string is @xmath33 , then the probability to find a string at a given transverse position is given by the integral of @xmath22 over the string area , i.e. @xmath34 . if the string with its electric field is present at a given @xmath19 , it will modify the value of the chiral condensate according to ( [ eq : conden ] ) . if not , then there will be no electric field and the chiral condensate will not be modified , so within the schwinger model it would be given by @xmath35 therefore in this picture the chiral condensate in the transverse plane can be computed as @xmath36 we will see below that from the fit to the lattice data the value of the effective radius of the string @xmath33 appears comparable to the lattice spacing , i.e. the string is indeed `` thin '' . 0.3 cm    in a recent lattice study @xcite , the authors compute on the lattice the following observable that quantifies the effect of confining flux tube on the chiral condensate : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the wilson loop operator of the static quarks . in our model </S>",
    "<S> , this quantity is given by @xmath39 the suppression of the chiral condensate has been also described recently in terms of the @xmath40 meson cloud surrounding the string @xcite . 0.3 cm to evaluate this quantity from ( [ eq : probform ] ) , we now need an independent information on the probability distribution @xmath22 . since @xmath22 is the probability to find a longitudinal chromoelectric field at a given point @xmath19 , the most direct source of information about it is the profile of chromoelectric field in the confining flux tube . </S>",
    "<S> there have been many lattice studies of the profile of the chromoelectric field between two static color charges . </S>",
    "<S> here we use the recent lattice results of @xcite . the measured chromoelectric field , as a function of the transverse coordinate , </S>",
    "<S> was shown to be described well by the following parameterization : @xmath41}{k_1(\\alpha ) } , \\label{eq : efpar}\\ ] ] where the values of the parameters above depend on the lattice coupling constant @xmath42 and the number of `` cooling steps '' used to remove the short wavelength fluctuations . in @xcite , the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 were computed for four values of the coupling . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : efield ] , we plot the profile of the electric field as a function of the transverse coordinate , computed at @xmath45 with 10 cooling steps .        we still have to fix the value of @xmath33 in order to compare with data . using the values of parameters given above </S>",
    "<S> , we found that the value @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the lattice spacing ( which also depends on the coupling ) provides a good description of the chiral condensate distribution in the vicinity of the flux tube , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : condplot ] . </S>",
    "<S> the effective radius of the string appears comparable to the lattice spacing , so it is indeed `` thin '' .        </S>",
    "<S> 0.3 cm from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , one can see that our simple model of fluctuating thin string describes the lattice results quite well . </S>",
    "<S> this lends additional support to the dual meissner mechanism of confinement , and suggests that the longitudinal dynamics along the core of the string can be adequately described by the dimensionally reduced @xmath6 dimensional model . in the future , it would be interesting to extend this approach to nonabelian strings . </S>",
    "<S> 0.3 cm another promising direction is to apply our findings to the phenomenology of nonperturbative jet fragmentation . </S>",
    "<S> we have already observed that the longitudinal momentum distributions within a jet are adequately described by the @xmath6 string model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fourier transform of the transverse coordinate distribution of the `` thin string '' extracted from the lattice data in this paper may allow to describe also the nonperturbative transverse momentum distribution inside the jet ; this introduces the `` intrinsic '' transverse momentum @xmath48 gev as required by the data . </S>"
