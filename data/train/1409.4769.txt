    "the kinematic data presented here are derived from integral field spectroscopic observations of m60-ucd1 taken on february 20th , may 18th , and may 19th , 2014 using gemini / nifs@xcite using the _ altair _ laser guide star adaptive optics with an open loop focus model .",
    "gemini / nifs provides infrared spectroscopy in @xmath29 pixels over a 3  field of view ; our observations were taken in the @xmath30 band at wavelengths from 2.0 to 2.4  @xmath4 m .",
    "the final data cube was made from a total of nine 900s on - source exposures with good image quality ( four taken on feb 20th , four on may 18th and one on may 19th ) .",
    "data were taken in an object - sky - object order .",
    "the sky frames were taken with small @xmath1510  offsets from the source at similar galactocentric radii within m60 .",
    "large diagonal @xmath151dithers made between the two neighboring object exposures ensure that the same sky pixels were not used even when the data are binned , thus improving our signal - to - noise @xmath31 .",
    "the gemini / nifs data were reduced similar to our previous work with nifs@xcite .",
    "each individual data cube was corrected using an a0v telluric star ( hip58616 ) at similar airmass . however , due to an error , no telluric star was observed on feb .",
    "20th so the telluric from may 18th was used to correct that exposure as well ; we test any effects this may have on our kinematic data in the next subsection and show that they are minimal .",
    "the gemini nifs pipeline was modified to enable proper error propagation and idl codes were used to combine the final data cube including an improved outlier rejection algorithm that uses neighboring pixels to help determine bad pixels .",
    "each dithered data cube was shifted and combined to yield a final data cube with 0.05@xmath320.05  spatial pixels ; a velocity offset to compensate for the differing barycentric corrections was applied to the february cubes .",
    "the final @xmath31 in the central pixels is @xmath1560 per resolution element at @xmath33  nm .    the instrumental dispersion of nifs varies by @xmath1520% across the field of view .",
    "to determine the instrumental dispersion of each spatial pixel , the sky frame exposures were dithered and combined identically to the science images . using this sky data cube",
    ", we fit isolated oh sky lines in each spatial pixel using double gaussian fits to derive the instrumental dispersion ; the median fwhm was 0.421  nm .",
    "the point spread function ( psf ) was derived by convolving an hst acs / wfc ( pid : 12369 ) image to match the continuum emission in the nifs data cube .",
    "we used a lucy - richardson deconvolved version of the hst f475w image ; the available f850lp image is closer in wavelength , but has a significantly more complicated and less well modeled psf .",
    "the deconvolved f475w image was then fit to our nifs image using the mpfit2dfun code .",
    "a double gaussian model was required to obtain a good fit to the psf ; the inner component has a fwhm of 0.155  and contains 55% of the light while the outer component has a fwhm of 0.62  and contains 45% of the light .",
    "the residuals to the fit have a standard deviation of just 6% out to a radii of 1  .",
    "this psf was assumed for the kinematics in all dynamical models .",
    "the kinematics were determined by fitting the co bandhead region ( 2.295 - 2.395 @xmath4 m ) to stellar templates@xcite using the penalized pixel fitting algorithm ppxf@xcite .",
    "we fit the radial velocity ( @xmath34 ) , dispersion ( @xmath11 ) , skewness ( @xmath35 ) , and kurtosis ( @xmath36 ) to the data . before fitting",
    ", the data were binned together using voronoi binning@xcite to achieve @xmath37 per resolution element in each bin .",
    "the voronoi bins at large radii were predominantly radial in shape , and thus beyond 0@xmath385 we binned spectra using elliptical sections with an axial ratio of 0.85 based on the observed ellipticity at these radii in the hst images .",
    "these outer bins have @xmath31 between 24 and 42 per resolution element .",
    "an example of kinematic fits in a high dispersion central pixel and low dispersion outer bin are shown in extended data ( ed ) fig .  1 .",
    "to determine errors on the derived kinematics in each bin , monte carlo estimates were performed by adding gaussian random noise to each spectral pixel in each bin , refitting the kinematics and then taking the standard deviation of the resulting data .",
    "the central velocity of m60-ucd1 is found to be @xmath39  km / s , while the integrated dispersion at @xmath40 is found to be @xmath41  km / s .",
    "both values are consistent with the integrated optical spectroscopy measurements@xcite .",
    "the kinematic maps in all four velocity moments are shown in ed fig .  2 .",
    "the bottom spectrum is at a radius of @xmath42 and is the sum of 17 spatial pixels .",
    "@xmath31 values are given per resolution element .",
    "the contrast in dispersion is seen very clearly , with broad smooth lines in the top spectrum and sharper lines in the bottom .",
    "both spectra were normalized to one ; the central spectrum was then offset by + 1 for visibility .",
    "the residuals were offset by 0.5 and 1.5.,width=336 ]    the robustness of the kinematic measurements and their errors was tested by comparing the data taken on feb .",
    "20th with the data taken in may .",
    "the four february and five may cubes were combined into separate final cubes .",
    "spectra were then extracted in the same bins as used for the full data set .",
    "we compared the velocity and dispersion differences between the cubes to the differences expected from the errors and found that these were consistent .",
    "more explicitly , we found that the distribution of @xmath43 had a standard deviation between 0.9 and 1.1 for both velocity and dispersion measurements ; the bias between the two measurements was less than the typical errors on the measurements .",
    "we also tested for template mismatch using phoenix model spectra@xcite and find consistent kinematic results within the errors .",
    "thus we conclude that ( 1 ) our kinematic measurements are robust and ( 2 ) our kinematics errors are correctly estimated .",

    "black contours show the @xmath30 band continuum at 1 mag / arcsec@xmath27 intervals .",
    "the median 1@xmath11 errors are 5.8  km / s for the velocities , 6.8  km / s for dispersion , 0.06 for @xmath35 , and 0.07 for @xmath36 .",

    "archival hubble space telescope data in the f475w ( @xmath8 ) filter ( program i d : 12369 ) provides the cleanest measurement of the light distribution of m60-ucd1 .",
    "we first fitted the data to a psf - convolved two component srsic profile using methods and profiles similar to previous fits of m60-ucd1@xcite . to enable the fitting of axisymmetric models ( see  4.1 )",
    ", we forced the outer nearly circular component ( with axial ratio @xmath44 0.95 ) to be exactly circular to ensure no isophotal twist in the model due to a misalignment of the inner and outer component . enforcing circularity in the outer component had a negligible effect on the quality of fit compared to the previous best fit model@xcite .",
    "our best fit axisymmetric model has : + outer srsic component ( circular ) : surface brightness @xmath45 , effective radius @xmath46 , srsic @xmath47 , integrated magnitude @xmath48 + inner srsic component : position angle @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 + we generated a multi - gaussian expansion ( mge)@xcite of this profile for use in our dynamical models .",
    "the mge values are shown in ed  table  1 .",
    "we note that data in the f850lp filter of m60-ucd1 is also available , but due to the lack of a red cutoff on the filter the psf is asymmetric , temperature dependent , and difficult to characterize .",
    "the one downside of using the f475w filter is that it is at a significantly different wavelength than the kinematic measurements .",
    "however , there is no evidence for any color variation within the object ; the inner and outer morphological components have consistent colors within 0.01 mags ( @xmath55 & 1.57 for the inner and outer components respectively ) .",
    "the radial profile of deconvolved f475w and f850lp images is flat ; any color differences are @xmath560.03 mags .",
    "thus there is no evidence for any stellar population differences within the object .",
    "the most common method for measuring dynamical black hole masses is schwarzschild orbit - superposition modeling@xcite of the stellar kinematics .",
    "here we use a triaxial schwarzschild code described in detail in a methods paper@xcite . to briefly summarize the method ,",
    "the dynamical models are made in three steps .",
    "first , a three - dimensional luminous mass model of the stars is made by de - projecting the two - dimensional light model from the _ hst _ image .",
    "this is done with the mge from the previous section , which is deprojected to construct a 3d mass distribution for the stars , assuming a constant mass - to - light ratio and a viewing angle .",
    "second , the gravitational potential is inferred from the combination of the stellar mass and black hole mass . in a triaxial potential ,",
    "the orbits conserve three integral of motions that can be sampled by launching orbits orthogonally from the x - z plane .",
    "a full set of representative orbits are integrated numerically , while keeping track of the paths and orbital velocities of each orbit .",
    "the orbit library we used for m60-ucd1 consists of 7776 orbits .",
    "third , we model the galaxy by assigning each orbit an amount of light , simultaneously fitting both the total light distribution and the nifs stellar kinematics ( ed  fig .",
    "2 ) including the effects of the psf given above .",
    "each of these steps are then repeated with different viewing angles and potentials to find the best - fitting mass distribution and confidence intervals .",
    "the recovery of the internal dynamical structure ( distribution function ) , intrinsic shape , and black hole mass using this code are validated in a series of papers@xcite .",
    "the orbit - based models are fully self - consistent and allow for all physically possible anisotropies ; the models make no _ a priori _ assumptions about the orbital configuration .    for modeling m60-ucd1 , we adopted a ( nearly ) oblate geometry with an intermediate axis ratio of @xmath57 . in total",
    "there are three free parameters : the stellar @xmath6 , the black hole mass , and the viewing angle .",
    "a total of 62 different stellar @xmath6s , sampled in linear steps , and 22 black hole masses , sampled in logarithmic steps , were modeled at 4 inclinations between 41 and 85 degrees to sample the intrinsic flattening @xmath58 between 0.13 and 0.73 .",
    "the individual grid points sampled are shown in fig .  3 of the main paper .",
    "we note that the observed rotation does not appear to cleanly rotate around the short axis , as the zero - velocity curve appears to twist at 0@xmath383 .",
    "this may suggest that the object is mildly triaxial , but this has minimal impact on our determination of the black hole mass and stellar @xmath6 .",
    "more significant is the increasing roundness of m60-ucd1 at large radii , which is fitted by our modelling .",
    "the nifs kinematics are used by the model to constrain the total mass distribution .",
    "the confidence contours shown in figure  3 of the main paper are marginalized over inclination and are based on fits to point symmetrized kinematic data@xcite .",
    "error bars are determined for the remaining two degrees of freedom , with @xmath59 , 6.18 , and 11.83 corresponding to 1@xmath11 , 2@xmath11 and 3@xmath11 .",
    "the best - fit constant @xmath6 model with no bh has a @xmath60 , and thus is excluded at more than 4@xmath11 .",
    "the reduced @xmath61 of the best - fit model to the unsymmetrized data is 0.96 for 280 observables and 3 parameters .",
    "the best - fit inclination is only constrained to be @xmath62 .",
    "such a weak constraint on the viewing angle is usual for dynamical models@xcite .",
    "there is no dust disk present in this object that can help to constrain the inclination .",
    "we note that the maximum @xmath6 ratio expected for an old stellar population with solar metallicity and a canonical imf is @xmath154.1 in @xmath34 band and @xmath155.1 in @xmath8 band@xcite .",
    "this value is somewhat higher than the best - fit @xmath63 , but is allowed at @xmath152@xmath11 ( see fig .  3 in main paper ) .",
    "the ability to detect a black hole with a given set of observations is often quantified by calculating the sphere of influence of the black hole . while the sphere of influence is normally calculated based on the dispersion of the object , the large bh mass fraction in m60-ucd1 makes the enclosed mass definition of the gravitational sphere of influence @xmath64 more comparable to previous @xmath65 measurements@xcite . using this definition",
    ", we find @xmath66 . following the convention presented in a recent review of black hole masses@xcite , we get @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the resolution of our psf core .",
    "we have many independent measurements of the kinematics within this radius .",
    "the dynamics show that this object has a multi - component structure . in the phase space",
    "there are several components visible ( ed  fig .  3 ) .",
    "roughly 70% of the stars are on co - rotating orbits , but the remainder are evenly split between counter - rotating and non - rotating , radial , orbits .",
    "this indicates that this object was not formed in a single formation event .",
    "the co - rotating orbits dominate at smaller radii with the addition of a non - rotating component at large radii .",
    "this corresponds well to the two component structure fit to the integrated light where we find an inner component with an axial ratio @xmath69 and an outer component that is nearly round@xcite .",
    "the anisotropy @xmath70 is nearly isotropic and does not significantly vary as function of radius . on the other hand",
    "@xmath71 gradually decreases outwards from 0 to smaller than -1 and is thus strongly negative .",
    "the anisotropy profiles and orbit types are shown in ed  fig .",
    "as expected in an ( nearly ) oblate system it is dominated by short - axis tubes , apart from the region near the black hole where the radial orbits take over .",
    "one of the most critical assumptions we make in these best - fit models is the assumption of a constant @xmath6 .",
    "this is a well justified simplification in the context of m60-ucd1 .",
    "as discussed above in section  3 , there is no evidence for any radial color variation , suggesting a stellar population with a constant age .",
    "furthermore , the formal age estimate from spectral synthesis measurements of integrated optical spectra 14.5@xmath720.5  gyr@xcite , leaving little room for any contribution from young populations with significant @xmath6 differences .",
    "radial variations in the initial mass function ( imf ) that would leave the color unchanged are not excluded _ a priori _ but are highly unlikely , as discussed in the next subsection .    to test our modelling , we also ran jeans models using the jam code@xcite .",
    "these models have been shown in the past to give consistent results in comparisons with schwarzschild models@xcite",
    ". however , we also note that the jam models enforce a simpler and not necessarily physical orbital structure , including a constant anisotropy aligned with cylindrical coordinates .",
    "furthermore , the jeans models do not fit the full line - of - sight velocity distribution as is done with the schwarzschild models .",
    "jam models were run over a grid of bh mass , @xmath73 , anisotropy @xmath74 , and inclination @xmath75 .",
    "fitting only the second moments , @xmath76 , we obtain a best fit stellar dynamical @xmath77 and @xmath78  m@xmath2 marginalizing over the other two parameters . the 1@xmath11 error bars given here were calculated assuming @xmath79 to give comparable error bars to the schwarzschild models .",
    "the fit is relatively insensitive to the other two parameters , with @xmath80 varying between -1 and 0 and @xmath75 between 50@xmath81 and 90@xmath81 .",
    "these models are fully consistent with the schwarzschild models fits . a zero bh mass jam model is strongly excluded in the data with @xmath82 and a best fit stellar dynamical @xmath83 .",
    "we also use the jeans modeling to investigate fully isotropic models .",
    "isotropy is observed in the central parsec of the milky way@xcite , the only galaxy nucleus where 3d velocities for individual stars have been measured .",
    "furthermore , isotropy has been assumed in the modeling of possible black holes in ucds@xcite .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath84 data of m60-ucd1 is also fully consistent with an isotropic model with a @xmath85 ( within the 1@xmath11 contour ) .",
    "this is consistent with the schwarzschild models , which find that the system is close to isotropic with @xmath86 .",
    "the best fit isotropic jeans model has bh mass of @xmath87  m@xmath2 and @xmath88 .",
    "+      we now discuss the possible dark matter content of m60-ucd1 and consider whether an alternative scenario could explain the kinematics of m60-ucd1 without a supermassive bh .",
    "dark matter is not expected to make a significant contribution to the kinematics of m60-ucd1 .",
    "this is due to the extremely high stellar density ; dissipationless dark matter can not achieve anywhere close to the same central densities as baryonic matter .",
    "this is shown clearly in previous work matching dark matter halos to galaxies@xcite .",
    "for realistic nfw halos , even a @xmath89  m@xmath2 halo would have only @xmath23  m@xmath2 within the central 100 pc , while a @xmath90  m@xmath2 halo would be required to have just @xmath91  m@xmath2 within m60-ucd1s effective radius ; thus even such a massive halo ( @xmath153 orders of magnitude more massive than would be expected for a galaxy with a stellar mass of @xmath1510@xmath21  m@xmath2 ) would contribute only @xmath151% to m60-ucd1s mass .",
    "more importantly , a dark matter halo would contribute an extended distribution of mass and fail to produce the central rise in the velocity dispersion .",
    "we note that the one previous resolved measurement of ucd kinematics@xcite found no evidence for dark matter in a significantly more extended ucd .",
    "including dark matter in our dynamical models would slightly decrease the stellar @xmath6 , which in turn , would further increase the inferred black hole mass in this object .",
    "an alternative to a massive black hole could be a centrally enhanced mass - to - light ratio . to test this scenario we constructed dynamical models without a black hole , but with a radial mass - to - light gradient .",
    "we found that the models with an @xmath6 slope of @xmath92 in log(radius ) , can yield a good fit , with a @xmath93 difference of @xmath94 from the best fit constant @xmath95bh model .",
    "this indicates that a model without a black hole and @xmath6 gradient is allowed at @xmath96-sigma .",
    "however , in addition to providing a slightly worse formal fit to the data , the @xmath6 gradient model is also less physically plausible than the presence of a supermassive bh .",
    "the log(r ) dependence means that the center has a very large @xmath6 .",
    "this is shown clearly in ed  fig .  5 .",
    "within our central resolution element ( r@xmath155  pc ) , the @xmath73 in this model is @xmath1512 compared to a value of @xmath152 at 100  pc .",
    "the model is thus replacing the bh mass with stellar mass near the center in order to match the kinematic data .",
    "this dramatic @xmath6 gradient can not be due to stellar age variations given m60-ucd1 s uniform color .",
    "the @xmath6 at @xmath97  pc is a factor of more than 2 above that expected for an old stellar population with a canonical imf ( see above ) and thus would require that more than half of the @xmath98  m@xmath2 inside that radius be in low mass stars or stellar remnants that produce little light@xcite .",
    "we note that dynamical mass segregation is not expected to occur in m60-ucd1 , as the half mass relaxation time is @xmath15350  gyr and remains more than 10  gyr at smaller radii@xcite .",
    "thus the only way to explain the @xmath6 gradient would be to have extreme radial variations in the initial mass function .",
    "assuming a change in the high mass end of the imf ( and thus an increase in stellar remnants ) , the required upper imf slope ( @xmath99 ) is between 0 and 1.4 at the center , as opposed to the canonical 2.35@xcite .",

    "in the main text we state that a comparable number of black holes may be found in ucds as are found in current galaxy nuclei .",

    "the sample is likely complete within 320  kpc of the ngc  1399 for the higher mass bin , but likely underestimates the total number of lower mass ucds by @xmath1530%@xcite .",

    "as discussed in the main manuscript , the stellar dynamical @xmath6 derived for m60-ucd1 ( @xmath24 , giving @xmath110 ) is lower than the dynamical @xmath111 estimates of 18 of the 19 ucds with mass estimates above 10@xmath112  m@xmath2 and about half the ucds between 3@xmath3210@xmath113  m@xmath2 and 10@xmath112  m@xmath2@xcite . in the high mass bin ,",

    "furthermore , m60-ucd1 is among the densest ucds and thus might be expected to have a high stellar @xmath6 under scenarios where imf variability is tied to the star formation rate density@xcite .",
    "therefore , we assume that the high dynamical @xmath6 estimates seen in ucds are due to massive bhs@xcite .",
    "if we take the fractions of objects more than 1@xmath11 above the m60-ucd1 s @xmath6 , then we have @xmath1518 bhs in the high mass sample , and an additional @xmath1556 in the low mass sample .",

    "if high @xmath6 ratio ucds do indeed have bhs , they will make a substantial contribution to the total number of bhs in the local universe .",
    "in order to test whether m60-ucd1 could have formed from tidal stripping , we simulated the orbital evolution of the ucd inside m60 through a series of direct n - body simulations using nbody6@xcite .",

    "<S> 18th issue at http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nature13762_ + ultracompact dwarf galaxies ( ucds ) are among the densest stellar systems in the universe . </S>",
    "<S> these systems have masses up to 200 million solar masses , but half light radii of just 3 @xmath0 50  parsecs@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> dynamical mass estimates show that many ucds are more massive than expected from their luminosity@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it remains unclear whether these high dynamical mass estimates are due to the presence of supermassive black holes or result from a non - standard stellar initial mass function that causes the average stellar mass to be higher than expected@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we present the detection of a supermassive black hole in a massive ucd . </S>",
    "<S> adaptive optics kinematic data of m60-ucd1 show a central velocity dispersion peak above 100 km / s and modest rotation . </S>",
    "<S> dynamical modeling of these data reveals the presence of a supermassive black hole with mass of 21 million solar masses . </S>",
    "<S> this is 15% of the object s total mass . </S>",
    "<S> the high black hole mass and mass fraction suggest that m60-ucd1 is the stripped nucleus of a galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis also shows that m60-ucd1 s stellar mass is consistent with its luminosity , implying many other ucds may also host supermassive black holes . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests a substantial population of previously unnoticed supermassive black holes .    </S>",

    "<S> it lies at a projected distance of 6.6 kpc from the center of the massive elliptical galaxy m60 ( fig .  1 ) , and 16.5  mpc from us@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained integral field spectroscopic data between 2 and 2.4 @xmath4 m of m60-ucd1 with gemini / nifs . </S>",
    "<S> the high spatial resolution data obtained using laser guide star adaptive optics provides a clear detection of the supermassive black hole ( bh ) . </S>",
    "<S> modeling of the deep co absorption bandheads at 2.3 @xmath4 m enables us to measure the motions of stars at many different points across m60-ucd1 . </S>",
    "<S> these kinematic measurements are shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> two features are particularly notable : ( 1 ) the dispersion is strongly peaked , with the central dispersion rising above 100  km / s and dropping outwards to @xmath5  km / s , ( 2 ) rotation is clearly seen , with a peak amplitude of 40  km / s . </S>",
    "<S> the stellar kinematics can be used to constrain the distribution of mass within m60-ucd1 . </S>",
    "<S> this includes being able to test whether the mass traces light , or if a supermassive bh is required to explain the central velocity dispersion peak . </S>",
    "<S> we combined the stellar kinematics and imaging from the hubble space telescope with self - consistent schwarzschild models@xcite to constrain the bh mass and mass - to - light ratio ( @xmath6 , in solar units ) , shown in figure  3 . </S>",
    "<S> we measure a black - hole mass of 2.1@xmath7  m@xmath2 and @xmath8 band @xmath9 with errors giving @xmath10 confidence intervals ( 2@xmath11 and 3@xmath11 contours are shown in fig .  3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the total stellar mass is @xmath12  m@xmath2 . the best fit constant @xmath6 model with no bh </S>",
    "<S> is ruled out with @xmath1399.99% confidence .    </S>",
    "<S> m60-ucd1 is the lowest mass system known to host a supermassive bh ( @xmath14  m@xmath2 ) including systems with dynamical bh estimates or with broad line agn@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there have been tentative detections of @xmath1510@xmath16  m@xmath2 bhs in lower mass clusters@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these detections remain controversial@xcite and the intermediate mass bhs , if present , form a much smaller fraction of the total cluster mass than found in m60-ucd1 . of the 75 galaxies with reliable dynamical bh mass measurements </S>",
    "<S> , only one other galaxy has a bh mass fraction as high as m60-ucd1@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a luminous and variable x - ray source was previously detected in m60-ucd1 with a maximum luminosity of @xmath17  ergs / s@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this luminosity suggests the bh is accreting material at a rate typical of bhs in larger , more massive early type galaxies in virgo , as well as other nearby galaxies with absorption - line dominated optical spectra @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> ucds are thought to be either the most massive globular star clusters@xcite or nuclei of larger galaxies that have been tidally stripped@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the supermassive bh that we have found at the center of m60-ucd1 provides strong evidence that it is a stripped nucleus of a once larger galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> while it is possible dense star clusters can form bhs , these are expected to contain only a small fraction of the cluster s mass@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> star clusters at the center of galaxy nuclei on the other hand are known to host black holes with very high mass fractions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus m60-ucd1 is the first individual ucd with explicit evidence for being a tidally stripped nucleus .    </S>",
    "<S> we can estimate the properties of m60-ucd1 s progenitor galaxy assuming that they follow scaling relations of present - day unstripped galaxies . using the known scaling between bh mass and bulge mass@xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we find a host bulge mass of 7@xmath18  m@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> bulge masses are also known to correlate with the masses of their nuclear star clusters@xcite . in m60-ucd1 , </S>",
    "<S> the surface brightness profile has two clear components@xcite , and we identify the central component as the progenitor nuclear star cluster@xcite with mass @xmath19  m@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this translates to a predicted bulge mass of @xmath20  m@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> thus two independent scaling relations suggest the progenitor bulge mass is @xmath1510@xmath21  m@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> given m60-ucd1 s cluster environment , its progenitor was likely a lower mass elliptical galaxy that was then stripped by the massive elliptical galaxy m60 which lies at a current projected distance of just 6.6  kpc . </S>",
    "<S> we have run simulations that show that it is feasible to produce m60-ucd1 by stripping a @xmath22  m@xmath2 elliptical galaxy progenitor on a fairly radial orbit ( see supplementary information & extended data fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 6 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note that current @xmath1510@xmath21  m@xmath2 elliptical galaxies have nuclear star cluster sizes , luminosities and colors consistent with the inner component of m60-ucd1@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the detection of a supermassive bh in m60-ucd1 may be just the tip of the iceberg of the ucd bh population . </S>",
    "<S> measurements of the integrated velocity dispersion in almost all ucds with masses above @xmath23  m@xmath2 yield dynamical mass estimates that are too high to be accounted for by a normal stellar population without a massive central bh@xcite . unlike these previous dynamical mass estimates </S>",
    "<S> , our dynamical modeling can separate out the gravitational influence of the bh from the contribution of the stars . </S>",
    "<S> the models show that m60-ucd1 s stellar populations appear normal . </S>",
    "<S> in m60-ucd1 we measured a stellar dynamical mass - to - light ratio of @xmath24 ( 1@xmath11 errors ) . </S>",
    "<S> this mass - to - light ratio is consistent with the stellar populations seen in lower mass globular clusters@xcite and models with a normal ( milky way ) initial mass function@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is also lower than the integrated dynamical mass - to - light ratio estimates in 18 of 19 ucds above @xmath23  m@xmath2@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the low stellar mass - to - light ratio in m60-ucd1 is inconsistent with proposed scenarios in which a density - dependent initial mass function yields higher than normal mass - to - light ratios@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> without such a mechanism , the simplest explanation for the high dynamical mass estimates in massive ucds is that most host supermassive bhs just like m60-ucd1 .    </S>",
    "<S> there is also more limited evidence for enhanced dynamical @xmath6s in lower mass ucds . </S>",
    "<S> about half of ucds with masses between @xmath25  m@xmath2 and @xmath23  m@xmath2 have higher inferred mass - to - light ratios than we see in m60-ucd1@xcite . taken in combination with tentative bh detections of @xmath26  m@xmath2 in local group globular clusters@xcite ( which do not have increased @xmath6 values due to much lower bh mass fractions ) , these observations suggest that some lower mass ucds may also host relatively massive bhs .    finally , we estimate what the total population of ucd bhs might be in the local universe . </S>",
    "<S> the most complete sample of known ucds is in the fornax cluster . comparing the ucd population to the population of galaxies in fornax likely to host massive bhs </S>",
    "<S> , we find that ucds may more than double the number of bhs ( see supplementary information ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus ucd bhs could represent a large increase in the massive bh number density in the local universe . </S>",
    "<S> future work can test this hypothesis . </S>",
    "<S> we have ongoing observing programs to obtain similar observations to the ones presented here in four additional massive ucds , and in the most massive star clusters in the local group . </S>",
    "<S> however , dynamical detection of black holes will be challenging in all but the brightest and nearest of objects , thus accretion signatures@xcite or tidal disruption events@xcite may represent the best possibility for detecting bhs in less massive ucds .    </S>",
