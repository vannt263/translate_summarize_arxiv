    "disequilibrium chemistry has been known in jupiter s atmosphere for several decades @xcite and has been expected and suspected in brown dwarf atmospheres from the time of their discovery @xcite .",
    "the most famous disequilibrium is an overabundance of co relative to ch@xmath0 .",
    "this occurs in jupiter and brown dwarfs when co is dredged up from deep , hot layers of the atmosphere more quickly than chemical reactions with ambient hydrogen can convert it to ch@xmath0 .",
    "it is to be expected that similar processes take place in young , self - luminous extrasolar giant planets . but",
    "the apparent paucity of methane in the atmospheres of planets with effective temperatures comparable to those of methane - rich t - type brown dwarfs was underpredicted and has been met with surprise",
    ".    among field brown dwarfs methane appears  by definition  at the l to t - type transition where their near - infrared colors turn to the blue at effective temperatures near 1200 k @xcite .",
    "the first directly imaged planets , however , were found to have effective temperatures below 1200 k and yet their near - infrared spectra were devoid of signs of methane in k band ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the best example is hr8799c : despite an effective temperature near 1100 k , in both low and high resolution spectra  particularly the high resolution spectrum taken by @xcite  methane has gone missing .",
    "surface gravity is the defining difference between extrasolar giant planets and brown dwarfs , and to date is the only proven difference , although there are great hopes for metallicity .",
    "field brown dwarfs ( hereafter bds ) have high surface gravities ( @xmath4 of order @xmath5 cm / s@xmath6 ) and therefore very compressed scale heights .",
    "extrasolar giant planets ( egps ) have modest surface gravities ( @xmath4 of order @xmath7 cm / s@xmath6 ) and extended scale heights ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are planets . ] .",
    "a bd and a self - luminous egp of the same composition and the same effective temperature will have similar optical depths as a function of temperature , at least in the absence of clouds ; i.e. , the function @xmath8 is roughly the same .",
    "however , because @xmath9 , the bd has a much higher pressure at a given optical depth than does the egp , and a bd is much cooler than the egp at a given pressure . because lower temperatures and higher pressure favor ch@xmath0 in its struggle with co , it has been pointed out that ch@xmath0 will be more easily seen and co less easily seen at lower gravity in bds @xcite .",
    "hence @xcite suggested that the even lower gravity of hr8799b might be why no methane is seen in it .",
    "we will verify that the dependence on @xmath4 is strong and leads to qualitatively different outcomes for bds and self - luminous egps , a result implicit in previous work but far from fully appreciated .",
    "previous studies of carbon speciation in bds and egps have mostly focused on a few particular objects @xcite , or on hot highly irradiated egps @xcite , or used one of several quench approximations culled from the literature @xcite , or various combinations of the above @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is that ch@xmath0 and co will often be seen in disequilibrium because the chemical reactions that would enforce equilibrium do nt have time enough to take place while the gas is cool @xcite .",
    "the disequilibrium composition that results is described as `` frozen - in '' or `` quenched . ''",
    "quenching has been widely used to quantify discussions of co - ch@xmath0 and n@xmath3-nh@xmath2 disequilibria in a wide range of astrophysical problems , dating at least back to @xcite s study of co in jupiter .",
    "earlier discussions of quenching can be found with respect to the n@xmath3-o@xmath3-no system that is important in thunderbolts @xcite , meteor entry and rocket rentry @xcite , and explosions in earth s atmosphere @xcite . in the quench approximation ,",
    "the disequilibrium composition that one can observe is approximated by the equilibrium composition when the relevant chemical reaction time scale @xmath10 equals the relevant cooling timescale , which if due to mixing can be written @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "there are many different prescriptions for defining @xmath10 and @xmath11 that we will discuss below . the history of quench schemes for jovian planets , exoplanets , and brown dwarfs has been comprehensively recounted in a series of recent papers by moses and colleagues @xcite .    here",
    "we do something different .",
    "we use a 1d chemical kinetics code coupled to @xmath12-@xmath13 profiles from a detailed 1d atmospheric structure code to compute a galaxy of chemical compositions in a wide range of possible brown dwarfs and cooling egps .",
    "the code explicitly includes reverses of all reactions so that , in the absence of atmospheric physics , the chemical composition would relax to equilibrium at every height .",
    "our strategy is to find the apparent quench points in all the models and analyze these for their systematic properties .",
    "we then fine tune our results by using them in quench approximations .",
    "our objective is to describe the emergent properties of the chemical network as a whole .",
    "our strategy differs from previous work that seeks to determine the one key rate - limiting step in a network of reactions , which is then treated as the effective reaction rate for the network as a whole .",
    "we limit the study to self - luminous cooling worlds for which insolation is not ( yet ) thermally important .",
    "this includes brown dwarfs , free - floating planets , and young directly - imaged planets .",
    "this category includes most of the exoplanets for which good data can be obtained in the present or in the near future .",
    "what this limitation means for carbon speciation is that we are concerned only with the conversion of co to ch@xmath0 . unlike @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite",
    ", we do not address the kinetic inhibition against oxidizing ch@xmath0 to co. the latter is an issue in strongly irradiated planets that are warm at high altitudes where , if vertical mixing is fast and the temperature not too hot , ch@xmath0 and its photochemical products will be overabundant @xcite . methane oxidation could be an issue for bds and cooling egps if the higher parts of their atmospheres are strongly heated by wave - breaking processes not taken into account in our radiative - convective model , but we do not further address this possibility here .    quenching in the nitrogen system has also been the subject of many studies over the years @xcite . as with methane , the underabundance of ammonia in brown dwarfs cold enough to favor it has been attributed to disequilibrium chemistry @xcite .",
    "the visibility of ammonia has been made the distinguishing characteristic of the y dwarf , the newest , coldest , and possibly last member of the stellar spectral sequence @xcite .",
    "the nh@xmath2-n@xmath3-hcn system differs from co and ch@xmath0 in interesting ways that lead to significantly different behavior .    finally , for completeness , we address quenching of co@xmath3 , a gas that can be relatively easy to observe from a space - based observatory and , because its abundance is sensitive to metallicity , can be relatively telling .",
    "co@xmath3 is not always thought of as a species subject to quenching ( but see @xcite ) . in the h@xmath3-rich ,",
    "uv - poor worlds that are the subject of this study , co@xmath3 quenching does take place .",
    "figure [ chem_figure ] illustrates the most important chemical pathways between co and ch@xmath0 in a warm h@xmath3-rich atmosphere .",
    "the path from co to ch@xmath0 climbs over three energy barriers , the first between co and formaldehyde ( h@xmath3co ) , the second between formaldehyde and methanol ( ch@xmath2oh ) , and the third between methanol and methane .",
    "the three barriers can be thought of as reducing the c@xmath14o triple bond to a double bond , reducing the c = o double bond to a single bond , and splitting c from o entirely .     in an h@xmath3-rich atmosphere .",
    "reactions from left to right are with h@xmath3 or h. key intermediate molecules are formaldehyde ( h@xmath3co ) and methanol ( ch@xmath2oh ) . other intermediates ( hco , h@xmath3coh , ch@xmath2o , ch@xmath2 ) are short - lived free radicals . where the species are plotted gives a rough indication of the energetics .",
    "energy barriers correspond to breaking c - o bonds : from triple to double , from double to single , and from single to freedom .",
    "relative magnitudes of reaction rates are indicated by arrow thickness for conditions near the quench point in a particular model ( red star on fig [ ensemble ] ) that gives roughly equal amounts of co and ch@xmath0 . at higher temperatures and lower pressures",
    "the plot as a whole would tilt to the left , with carbon pooling in co. at lower temperatures and higher pressures the plot as a whole tilts to the right and carbon pools in ch@xmath0 .",
    "the energy barriers pose greater obstacles when the gas is colder .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in photochemistry the first barrier is unimportant because atomic hydrogen is generated in abundances that vastly exceed equilibrium @xcite .",
    "kinetic barriers to adding h to co to make hco or adding h to hco to make h@xmath3co are insignificant .",
    "the third barrier is unimportant in photochemistry because incident uv radiation readily splits ch@xmath2oh into ch@xmath2 and oh , which is quickly followed by adding photochemical h to ch@xmath2 to make ch@xmath0 . in photochemistry the energy to overcome the first and third barriers comes from uv photons .",
    "by contrast , the middle barrier is not easily overcome by photochemistry .",
    "formaldehyde is readily photolyzed but the products are either co or hco ; i.e. , regress that leaves the c = o bond unbroken",
    ". meanwhile successive 3-body additions of photochemical h to h@xmath3co to make ch@xmath2oh face considerable kinetic barriers , save at high temperatures where ch@xmath0 is not favored .",
    "the historic focus of the planetary literature was therefore on reactions that go from formaldehyde to methanol .",
    "@xcite suggested @xmath15 , an ambitious reaction that jumps two hurdles at once , as the rate - limiting step , while yung et al ( 1988 ) suggested that @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 represents a third body ) would be the bottleneck .",
    "both schemes have been widely used , for jupiter @xcite , egps @xcite , and bds @xcite .    without the photochemical assist , any of the three barriers",
    "could potentially block the reaction .",
    "recently , @xcite concluded that the rate - limiting reaction is the one that breaks the c - o single bond .",
    "they report that the bottleneck is between methanol and methane , @xmath18 when methane is abundant , or goes through a free radical @xmath19 when methane is scarce",
    ". we will concur with the former but not the latter .",
    "standard 1d codes simulate atmospheric chemistry by computing the gains and losses of chemical species at different altitudes while accounting for vertical transport .",
    "vertical transport is parameterized as a diffusive process with an `` eddy diffusion coefficient , '' denoted @xmath20 [ cm@xmath6/s ] .",
    "volume mixing ratios @xmath22 of species @xmath23 are obtained by solving continuity @xmath24 and force ( flux ) @xmath25 equations . in these equations @xmath26 is the total number density ( @xmath27 ) ; @xmath28 represent chemical production and loss terms , respectively ; @xmath29 is the upward flux ; @xmath30 , the binary diffusion coefficient between @xmath23 and the background atmosphere @xmath31 , describes true molecular diffusion ; and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the molecular masses of @xmath31 and @xmath23 .",
    "we implement molecular diffusion of a heavier gas through h@xmath3 by setting @xmath34 @xmath35s@xmath36appropriate for co  for all the heavy species .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation for present purposes , as our concern is with quenching at altitudes well below the homopause .",
    "the physical meaning of @xmath30 is the ratio of the relative thermal velocities of the two species to their mutual collision cross section . in the present circumstances , the relative thermal velocity is effectively that of h@xmath3 , so the only important source of variation in @xmath30 stems from the different diameters of the molecules",
    ". the code has been used by @xcite to address hot jupiters and by @xcite and @xcite to address h@xmath3-rich hot neptunes and super - earths .",
    "temperature and pressure profiles are imported from the output of detailed radiative - convective models that are described elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the models are cloudless and of solar metallicity .",
    "adding cloud opacity would make the @xmath12-@xmath13 profiles hotter and less favorable to ch@xmath0 .",
    "the cloudless model is something of a best case for methane .    treating vertical transport as diffusion is a necessary evil in a 1-d code",
    ". we will regard @xmath20 as a mildly constrained free parameter .",
    "in free convection , @xmath20 has been estimated from mixing length theory @xcite , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the universal gas constant , @xmath39 the convective heat flux , @xmath40 the mean molecular weight ( dimensionless ) , @xmath41 the density , and @xmath42 the heat capacity of the gas .",
    "the mixing length is approximated by the scale height .",
    "an upper bound is obtained from eq [ gierasch ] by equating @xmath39 with @xmath43 , @xmath44 these large values of @xmath20 might be regarded with some skepticism .",
    "if applied to earth s troposphere , eq [ gierasch ] predicts @xmath45 cm@xmath6/s , which is two orders of magnitude too high . even in the present context",
    ", @xmath39 can be much smaller than @xmath43 ( or even fall to zero in places ) , because a considerable fraction of energy transport is by radiation .",
    "depending on how well one tolerates theory , one might expect @xmath20 to be of the order of @xmath46-@xmath47 cm / s@xmath6 in the convecting zones of self - luminous egps , and @xmath48 smaller for bds with @xmath49 cm / s@xmath6 .",
    "it is likely that @xmath20 would be much smaller in stratified gas above the convecting regions . on earth , @xmath20 drops by two orders of magnitude at the tropopause .",
    "@xcite reduce @xmath20 by several orders of magnitude in the stratosphere .",
    "simulations by @xcite support this expectation .",
    "the tradeoff is between simplicity ( constant @xmath20 ) and realism ( a vertical discontinuity in @xmath20 ) .",
    "the latter choice would introduce two more free parameters , the value of @xmath20 in the stratosphere ( ill constrained ) and the altitude of the discontinuity ( reasonably well constrained , but results could be sensitive to this ) .",
    "a two layer model also makes interpreting the numerical results in terms of a quench approximation less straightforward because there can be more than one quench point . for this study",
    "we choose to treat @xmath20 as constant with height , but vary it over a range wide enough to encompass all likely values .",
    "the chemical system used here comprises 366 forward chemical reactions and 32 photolysis reactions of 64 chemical species made of h , c , n , o , and s. the most important missing species is probably methylamine , ch@xmath2nh@xmath3 .",
    "reaction rates when known are selected from the publicly available nist database ( http://kinetics .",

    "although many of the important reactions have been measured in both directions in the lab ( e.g. , both @xmath50 and @xmath51 have been heavily studied ) , in general one direction is much better characterized than the other .",
    "thermodynamic data ( enthalpies and entropies ) are usually better known over a wider range of temperatures .",
    "thus it is better to complement each specific reaction with its exact reverse , with the forward and reverse rates linked self - consistently by the thermodynamic data of the species involved . this way the transition from equilibrium to kinetically - controlled abundances is automatic .",
    "equilibrium is reached when all the important forward and reverse reactions are fast compared to changes in the state variables .",

    "inaccurate thermodynamic data for free radicals are not a problem for equilibrium calculations of well - characterized abundant species because poorly - characterized free radicals are never abundant . on the other hand , poorly - characterized species",

    "even with @xmath20 as high as @xmath47 cm@xmath6/s , quenching in the co - ch@xmath0 system takes place at temperatures less than 2200 k. hence we can always presume that co is most abundant and ch@xmath0 least abundant at the lower boundary of our model .",
    "it follows that we can determine the quench conditions ( temperature @xmath114 , pressure @xmath115 ) by working up from the lower boundary and finding the lowest altitude at which the product @xmath116 is appreciably smaller than the equilibrium constant @xmath117 . in practice we searched for the lowest altitude where @xmath118 .",
    "we also wish to determine a quench timescale @xmath119 . in principle , the right way to do this is to determine the true chemical reaction timescale from the sum of all relevant reaction rates at the quench point . in general",
    "this information is surprisingly hard to extract from a model , because the breakdown of equilibrium appears as small differences between much larger forward and reverse reaction rates in many reactions .",
    "this approach is practical only if one already knows exactly which species and reactions are key .",
    "once known , for @xmath119 to be useful in a quench approximation one then needs a comparably fine - grained description of the cooling time implicit in @xmath20 and the particular chemical reactions that establish @xmath119 .",
    "much easier , and more useful , is to define a quench timescale for the system as a whole in terms of a relevant mixing time , @xmath120 where @xmath121 is a characteristic length scale .",
    "the simple choice is to set @xmath122 , the scale height at @xmath114 .",
    "this definition is arbitrary to within a multiplicative factor because the true mixing length @xmath121 is not in general equal to @xmath123 . but this definition of @xmath119 is precisely what is needed for constructing a new quench approximation that assumes @xmath124 and , as seen in figure [ xx ] , it leads to a very simple description of the overall behaviour of the full network of chemical reactions .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that @xmath121 is often considerably shorter than @xmath125 , mostly because the key reactions determining @xmath119 are much more sensitive to temperature than to pressure .",

    "two things get in the way . of less importance , a third species ",
    " becomes non - negligible at high temperatures .",
    "hcn also quenches at high temperature , which leaves the nitrogen system with three possibly distinct quench points : nh@xmath2-n@xmath3 , nh@xmath2-hcn , and n@xmath3-hcn . although hcn is never very abundant in equilibrium , it is often abundant enough that its decomposition can increase the nh@xmath2 abundance by more than 10% after the nh@xmath2-n@xmath3 reaction has quenched .",
    "when confused with the second , greater obstacle , hcn can make it difficult to pinpoint where quenching occurs .",

    "the equilibrium between hcn and ch@xmath0 and nh@xmath2 , @xmath225 closely resembles the parallel equilibrium eq [ k_eq ] between co and ch@xmath0 . for the cool objects in which ch@xmath0 is abundant at depth",

    "* ) that by @xmath261 at @xmath80 this band head produces only a slight spectral feature .",
    "consulting figure [ columns ] and scaling appropriately we expect , all else being equal , that co would remain detectable down to @xmath262 at @xmath79 and 500 k at @xmath72 .",
    "this temperature is considerably cooler than expected by the conventional wisdom .",
    "we likewise can consider the appearance of the @xmath263 methane band which by definition first appears at the t0 spectral type at @xmath264 .",
    "figure [ columns ] suggests that a comparable gravity - adjusted column abundance of methane will not appear in a saturn - like @xmath265 planet until @xmath266 .",
    "the directly imaged companion gj 504 b @xcite provides a test of this reasoning .",
    "the mass and effective temperature of gj 504 b have been estimated at @xmath267 and 600 k. its gravity should be @xmath268 . by the reasoning above methane would be expected and indeed has been detected @xcite .",
    "methane is far more detectable in the @xmath269 fundamental band where the absorption cross section is over an order of magnitude larger .",
    "@xmath253 has been detected here as early as spectral type l5 @xcite in field dwarfs .",
    "likewise spectra over this wavelength range would better help to constrain the arrival of methane at low gravity in the directly imaged planets .",
    "indeed @xcite report a possible detection of this same feature in hr 8799 c , suggesting a trace abundance in the upper atmosphere .",
    "another test of these ideas may be provided by field t or y dwarfs with unusual colors not predicted by models .",
    "faint , red objects in particular would be good candidates for the low gravity , methane - poor objects we predict .",
    "for example the cool y dwarf wise 1828 + 2650 @xcite , is both faint and unusually red in @xmath270 color @xcite . while cushing et al .",
    "did detect methane in this object , chemical equilibrium models do a very poor job fitting the available photometry @xcite .",
    "near - ir spectra should be obtained of all such color outliers to search for methane spectral features .",
    "we note that some searches for planetary companions to young stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as well as surveys for ` planetary - mass ' t - dwarfs in young stellar clusters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have employed differential - methane band imaging . in this technique @xcite",
    "two images of a target are taken , one in a filter that matches the @xmath271 @xmath253 band and one which probes the entire _",
    "when the two images are differenced , methane - bearing objects stand out as they are dark in the @xmath253 filter .",
    "our conclusions here suggest that such techniques must be used with caution as methane may simply not yet be present in planetary - mass objects even at effective temperatures below 1000 k.    similar arguments can be made for the appearance of other spectral features of interest .",
    "we expect that @xmath252 will appear at effective temperatures about @xmath272 cooler in planets compared to field brown dwarfs .",
    "hcn , with a cross section of @xmath273 per molecule at @xmath274 is unlikely to be detectable in most objects as the computed column abundances are less than @xmath275 .",
    "hcn s prospects are poor at 3.0 microns despite a high cross - section unless the c / o ratio is higher than solar and water s abundance reduced .",
    "water s cross section is 100-fold smaller , but with solar abundances its column ( @xmath276 @xmath277 ) is 1000 times what hcn can reach at its best .",
    "carbon dioxide has an absorption cross section @xmath278 per molecule at @xmath279 , and with abundances approaching @xmath275 we expect it to be detectable at around 900 to 1100 k in field brown dwarfs .",
    "indeed the akari space telescope discovered @xmath280 features in several",
    "late l and early t dwarfs @xcite .",
    "judging by figure [ columns ] , we would predict @xmath280 to be detectable to 500 k and cooler in the lowest mass planets .",
    "we use a reasonably complete 1-d chemical kinetics code to survey the parameter space that encompasses atmospheres of cool brown dwarfs and warm young extrasolar giant planets .",
    "our model contains only gas phase chemistry of small molecules containing h , c , n , o , and s. we use realistic @xmath12-@xmath13 profiles for cloudless atmospheres with effective temperatures between 500 and 1100 k and surface gravities between @xmath7 cm / s@xmath6 to @xmath254 cm / s@xmath6 .",
    "vertical transport is described by an eddy diffusivity @xmath20 that we vary over a wide range . our objective is to describe carbon and nitrogen speciation , especially at lower ( planetary ) surface gravities .",
    "overviews of what we found are presented in figure [ ensemble ] for carbon and figure [ zz ] for nitrogen .",
    "we find that carbon in cloudless brown dwarfs is predominantly in the form of methane at 900 k for @xmath80 cm / s@xmath6 .",
    "the small surface gravity of planets strongly discriminates against ch@xmath0 when compared to an otherwise comparable brown dwarf .",
    "if vertical mixing is comparable to jupiter s , methane first predominates over co in planets cooler than 500 k. sluggish vertical mixing can raise the transition to 600 k ; clouds or more vigorous vertical mixing could lower it to 400 k.    the detectability of specific molecular features in a spectrum depends on the strength of the molecular absorption cross sections as well as the gaseous abundance .",
    "nevertheless a natural prediction of our model is that there will be cool planets with no methane observed in the h or k spectral bands .",
    "the refractory behavior of co in low gravity objects is likely at least partially responsible for the lack of cool planets found by the nici survey , which relied upon the methane absorption h band to identify planets @xcite .",
    "ammonia is also sensitive to gravity , but unlike methane and co , ammonia is insensitive to mixing , which makes it a proxy for gravity .",
    "we did not explore temperatures low enough to determine the transition from n@xmath3 to ammonia in planets , but it is nearly as abundant as n@xmath3 at 500 k in brown dwarfs , which is broadly consistent with the observed properties of the y dwarfs @xcite for which @xmath252 is seen in h band . on the other hand",
    ", ammonia persists as an abundant minor species to rather high temperatures and this is consistent with it being readily detected in mid - ir spectra of t - dwarfs @xcite .",
    "hcn might become interesting in high gravity brown dwarfs if vertical mixing is very vigorous .",
    "when expressed in terms of quenching parameters , nearly all our results for co and ch@xmath0 can be reduced to a simple equation in arrhenius form that is easy to use but not easy to interpret . from a strictly practical perspective , what we find is close to what one gets using @xcite s algorithm in its original form ( a fortuitous accident of using too high a rate for the wrong reaction ) .",
    "the apparent simplicity is somewhat surprising given the complexity of the chemistry involved and the many different ways the system has been described in the literature . nor is our result quite what we expected .",
    "first , we find that the timescale @xmath203 for hydrogenation of co is shorter for higher metallicity .",
    "because the forward reactions that destroy co have no metallicity dependence , we infer that metallicity dependence enters through the reverse reaction ( oxidation of ch@xmath0 ) . by definition",
    "the reverse reaction is as fast as the forward reaction while in equilibrium , but it falls off more quickly than the forward reaction as the temperature drops .",
    "the important forward reactions are linear in metallicity whilst the important reverse reactions are quadratic in metallicity .",
    "second , we find that @xmath203 is inversely proportional to pressure .",
    "analyses based on isolating a limiting reaction predict a stronger dependence on pressure , typically @xmath161 .",
    "the weaker @xmath162 pressure dependence is expected for a reaction involving co itself , such as @xmath281 it is interesting that r[h2+co ] actually does have the highest @xmath56 value in the co hydrogenation sequence , and therefore the highest energy barrier , and that the magnitude of @xmath56 of r[h2+co ] is what we infer in eq [ t_chem ] .",
    "but it is also quite clear from figure [ yy ] that equilibrium breaks down between ch@xmath2oh and ch@xmath0 well before if breaks down between co and ch@xmath2oh , as was found by @xcite .",
    "reactions involving ch@xmath2oh imply a @xmath161 pressure dependence , because the equilibrium abundance of ch@xmath2oh with respect to co goes as the square of the h@xmath3 pressure .",
    "the system behaves  both in the 40,000 k energy barrier and the @xmath162 pressure dependence as if the overall rate depends on the entry reaction r[h2+co ] rather than on the rate of r[methanol ] in which equilibrium actually breaks down .",
    "the apparent paradoxes might be resolved through a more complete analysis of the reverse reactions , or they may result from systematic biases stemming from our treating the mixing length as equal to a scale height , rather than as the complex function of many variables that it probably is @xcite .    for nitrogen and ammonia we were unable to recover an emergent arrhenius - like behavior from the full system .",
    "on the other hand , it was easy to devise a good quench approximation , and we also found that some published quench approximations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) work very well .",
    "for hcn , we met with mixed success .",
    "we did find emergent arrhenius - like behaviors , and we developed a new quench approximation that works quite well for our models .",
    "on the other hand there does not yet appear to be a consensus on what the quench chemistry of hcn actually is .",
    "we found a wide scatter of different outcomes when comparing different published quench schemes .",
    "we think our quench approximation should work well for warm objects where hcn is predicted to be relatively abundant but , because we did not consider hypothetical hydrogenation channels through methylamine @xcite , our models may overestimate @xmath233 , especially in cooler objects .",
    "there are many effects that our models do not address .",
    "none of these effects have much sway over our quench approximations , but they have much to do with what might actually be present in a real atmosphere .",
    "clouds are likely the most important . adding infrared opacity to an atmosphere is effectively equivalent to reducing the gravity .",
    "this is because opacity raises the @xmath12-@xmath13 profile ( i.e. , the adiabat ) to a lower pressure for a given effective temperature .",
    "a cloudy atmosphere favors co and n@xmath3 over ch@xmath0 and nh@xmath2 , other things equal .",
    "increasing metallicity also increases opacity to the detriment of methane and ammonia .",
    "another issue for real worlds is that @xmath20 may be much smaller in higher altitude radiative regions of the atmosphere than it is in the convecting region .",
    "the radiative stratosphere is the part of the atmosphere where @xmath20 the modeling parameter is most suspect . for n@xmath3 and nh@xmath2 pronounced vertical structure in @xmath20 will not matter much . for co and ch@xmath0 , sharply lower values of @xmath20 in the stratosphere might be important ,",
    "because if @xmath20 is low enough , the atmosphere can have a second quench point in the stratosphere .",
    "such behavior no problem to a full kinetics model , but it can make implementing quench approximations more complicated .",
    "photochemistry induced by irradiation from a nearby star can deplete nh@xmath2 and increase co@xmath3 and hcn .",
    "lightning and/or impact shocks in cool nh@xmath2- and ch@xmath0-rich atmospheres can generate co and hcn @xcite",
    ". in warmer objects , catalysts that may be present in metallic clouds ( here we mean real metals ) will lower the quench point and thus will favor nh@xmath2 , ch@xmath0 , and co@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "all of these ideas will be put to the test by the directly imaged planets that are expected to be discovered in the coming months and years .",
    "constraining the composition of their atmospheres will no doubt be a rewarding endeavour .",
