    "nulling pulsars , first identified by @xcite , spontaneously and suddenly ( typically within one rotation ) cease to emit at a detectable level .",
    "after an interval ranging from a few rotations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to a few years , e.g. psr  j1841@xmath20500 ( @xmath0600 days , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , emission resumes just as suddenly .",
    "this wide range of timescales , most of which are significantly longer than those natural to a pulsar magnetosphere , is difficult to explain through a single mechanism .",
    "because radio emission arises from coherent plasma processes , short nulls have been interpreted as fluctuations in the plasma state that briefly disrupt or alter the required coherency . in other pulsars",
    " particularly those with drifting subpulses  the nulling phenomenon may be related to the geometry of a drifting `` carousel '' of sparks @xcite whose drift rate depends on the local charge density above the polar cap . for example , @xcite determined the subpulse drift rate of psr  b0809 + 74 drops to zero during nulls , while @xcite identified subpulse periodicity persisting through nulls in psr  b1133@xmath316 , suggesting these short nulls are simply gaps in the drifting beam pattern .    on the other hand , the pulsars that null on long timescales , e.g. psr  b1931@xmath324 ( @xmath030 days , * ? ? ? * ) , psr  j1841@xmath20500 ( @xmath0600 days , * ? ? ? * ) , and psr  j1832@xmath30029 ( @xmath0600800 days , * ? ? ? * ) are intermittent in the sense that the currents and particle acceleration powering radio emission may cease , or at the very least change sufficiently to steer the radio beam away from the earth ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the key piece of evidence comes from the measurement of the spindown rate ( ) of each state , which decreases by a factor of 1.52.5 when the pulsar is nulling , indicating a dramatic reconfiguration of the magnetospheric currents and , consequently , torque .",
    "similar switches between metastable magnetosphere / spindown states have been identified by @xcite , who discovered a quasiperiodic modulation of the spindown rate in a sample of pulsars monitored over several decades .",
    "moreover , they found that in some pulsars , switches between levels were accompanied by changes in pulse profile ( i.e. mode changes , * ? ? ? * ) , thus linking emission properties to magnetosphere state .",
    "the stochastic switches between states introduce red noise into timing residuals relative to a spindown model with a single , suggesting that such state switching may be of fundamental importance to the timing noise phenomenon and thus to pulsar timing arrays .",
    "these long timescale observations make abundantly clear that at least some pulsars switch between metastable magnetospheres .",
    "however , because switches happen rarely and rapidly , it is difficult to catch these pulsars `` in the act '' and gain insight into both what these states physically represent and how the switching is accomplished .",
    "pulsars with intermittency of hours likely also represent magnetospheric switching , though the intermittent durations are too short to measure independent values of .",
    "such pulsars can be targeted with observations to resolve all relevant timescales and may thus yield clues to the switching process . in a clear example of the power of such systems , @xcite discovered that the x - ray emission from psr b0943@xmath310 is correlated with radio mode changes , implying rapid cooling of the neutron star polar cap after the pulsar switches from its radio - faint to its radio - bright mode .    , discovered by @xcite in a 20 cm parkes survey of the galactic plane ,",
    "is a strong nuller and is inactive most of the time .",
    "indeed , in a 2-hr observation , @xcite observed only one brief , 3.5 minute burst of emission , leading those authors to conclude the nulling fraction is @xmath495% . during these scarce active states",
    ", the pulsar continues to null , albeit at a much lower rate .",
    "hereafter , to distinguish between the multi - hour nulls separating active periods ( aps ) and the @xmath51-minute nulls within active periods ( see below ) , we refer to long nulls as inactive periods ( ips ) .    with the lengthy breaks between aps ,",
    "the telescope time required to obtain many realizations of this cycle is prohibitive . instead ,",
    "in order to monitor the long - term behaviour of , we used short , low time - resolution snapshot observations obtained over six years with the parkes radio telescope . to access short timescales , we complemented these with two rise - to - set parkes observations of 9.5hr during which we obtained high time - resolution data . during the first track , we also observed simultaneously with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) . with these data",

    "we additionally use these well - calibrated data to measure the polarization and pulse broadening of and to place a stringent limit on any persistent emission from ips .",

    "this is the first published measurement of , from which several important properties , listed in table [ tab : parms ] , can be estimated .      to measure the active - state flux density ,",
    "we selected only observations in which emission was detected , and we further deleted sub - integrations visibly affected by substantial nulling or a state switch .",
    "we employed two methods of calculating the flux density : ( 1 ) simply adding up signal in excess of baseline and ( 2 ) fitting an analytic template to the profile and inferring the flux from the template scale .    the absolute flux density of at 20 cm .",
    "the green circles and dashed line ( mean ) indicate flux densities derived using method 1 , while the salmon squares and dot - dashed line ( mean ) indicate flux densities derived with method 2 , i.e. by fitting a template .",
    "an uncertainty of 10%a typical level encapsulating calibration errors and interstellar scintillation  is indicated by the black error flag in the lower lefthand corner .",
    "the blue star indicates the atca - derived pulsed flux density (  [ sec : atca ] ) . ]",
    "the results , shown in figure [ fig : flux_lc ] , indicate the intrinsic flux density is stable over the years of observation , with variations readily explained by modest scintillation in the interstellar medium and small calibration errors .",
    "moreover , the flux density is mututally consistent between the two methods ; since the second measurement explicitly measures flux density with the expected pulse shape while the first method measures any flux density above baseline , the pulse profile must also be stable at this level .",
    "the mean flux density is 5.2@xmath210.3mjy , which is substantially different from previous values reported in the literature .",

    "give a flux density of 54mjy based on data from the parkes multibeam pulsar survey . because the survey pointings were substantially offset from the position of",
    ", this discrepancy may have resulted from either an inaccurate model of the sensitivity at the edges of the beam or the use of an inaccurate pulsar position .",
    "we also obtained calibrated flux measurements from the 10 cm and 50 cm observations discussed below , with flux densities of 0.96mjy and 16.9mjy , respectively , following a fairly typical power law @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "with many observations of , we are in a position to refine the nulling fraction ( inactive fraction , in our parlance ) estimate of @xcite .",
    "however , the typical time spends in either state is substantially longer than the few - minute pulse@parkes observations .",
    "further , as there is a natural bias among both high schools students and astronomers to extend ( curtail ) observations of the pulsar when it is active ( inactive ) , a simple tally of the total time the pulsar is observed to be bright is biased .",
    "on the other hand , switches are random , and , if the process is memoryless ( poisson ) , switch rates are unaffected by observational bias . moreover , since switches are rare for this pulsar , we expect to see no more than one state switch in a given sub - integration . thus , to estimate switch rates from our fold - mode data , which has typical time resolution of 30s , we classify by inspection each sub - integration into one of four classes : @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , or @xmath27 .",
    "we then simply count the instances of each class and tally the total time spent in each state in table [ tab : switches ] .",

    "the value of @xmath55 we obtained to determine ts corresponds directly to the flux density of each single pulse , modulo some scatter from pulse - to - pulse profile variations .",
    "the distribution of ap pulse flux densities , excluding pulses affected by rfi and scaled to the measured mean flux ( 5.2mjy ) , appears in figure [ fig : fluxdist ] .",
    "the nulls form a narrow normal distribution peaked about zero .",
    "this distribution appears identical to the flux density distribution obtained from ips ( not shown ) , which is exceedingly gaussian and has an r.m.s .",
    "of 0.39mjy .",
    "the flux density distribution from non - null pulses , with its high - flux tail , appears to be approximately lognormal , though we note there is a slight underrepresentation of faint pulses relative to that model . because the variance of the ip distribution is small compared to the non - null distribution ( r.m.s .",
    "2.05mjy ) , the observed distribution is a good proxy for the intrinsic distribution of single pulse fluxes .      finally , we searched the data for evidence of correlations between pulses , e.g. as from drifting subpulses .",
    "as the relatively modest s / n and the narrow pulse window preclude direct detection of subpulses , we instead searched directly for periodicity in the power spectral density ( psd ) of the single pulse fluxes .",
    "however , the psd of each of the aps was consistent with white noise , and we conclude there is no measurable correlation between pulses . likewise , we looked for any correlation between null duration and the flux of the preceeding / following pulses , e.g. as in that of psr  b1944@xmath317 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "there is no evidence of correlation , save perhaps that the first pulse of an ap tends to be weaker than average .",
    "distribution of observed single pulse flux densities ; those identified as nulls are shown in grey , while those identified as non - nulls are drawn in black .",
    "the mean flux , 5.2mjy , is indicated by the dashed vertical line.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "in summary , we find is well described as a four - state system : an `` active '' state ( 0 ) with nulls at two discrete timescales ( 1 and 2 ) and no evidence of complex pulse substructure or memory across nulls ; and an `` inactive state '' ( 3 ) whose emission , if present , must be at least 1,000 times fainter than that of state 0 .",
    "it remains unclear if any of the null states ( 1 , 2 , and 3 ) correspond to the same magnetospheric configuration .",
    "the stability of the pulsar s flux density and profile over timescales of years , as well as the absence of pecularities in its timing solution , suggest the pulsar is stable when averaged over many state transitions , i.e. more than a few days .",
    "the distribution of durations of both aps and ips has a large scatter , but due to the lack of short aps and ( especially ) short ips , each appears to have an intrinsic timescale  that is , neither switching process is memoryless .",
    "the complete aps and ips in our two long - track observations have mean values of 1240s and 7240s , respectively , and standard deviations of 690s and 5160s , indicating a fairly white spectrum for the ips and a redder spectrum for the aps .",
    "both timescales are difficult to reconcile with any typical magnetospheric process , and a more likely scenario is a switch between two metastable states triggered by a quasiperiodic perturbation .",
    "for example , @xcite have proposed that circumpulsar debris from supernova fallback disks might perturb a pulsar s magnetosphere , particularly the outer gaps @xcite or the equatorial disk of return current ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "such a disk could lie well below our limits on reflection (  [ sec : off - pulse ] ) but still source asteroids which plunge into the magnetosphere every few hours and provide enough ionized material to substantially alter the current flow . although the ionized material would only persist for about a rotation , the magnetosphere would at that point have settled into a new metastable state . in this picture ,",
    "short ap nulls are simply due to plasma fluctuations or patchy emission , an interpretation supported by the approximately exponential distribution of `` on '' intervals .",
    "the longer ( @xmath010 rotation ) nulls , however , likely represent a state switch , and may represent an intermediate state between active and inactive states : if the long nulls and ips correspond to identical magnetospheric configurations , the absence of nulls of of intermediate lengths ( few hundred rotations ) is puzzling .",
    "although we can not directly measure the difference in spindown rate between aps and ips , we can estimate the contribution of such switching to the r.m.s . of the toa residuals to our timing solution ( figure [ fig : timing_solution ] ) .",
    "following equation 12 of @xcite and using the measured state durations of 1100s ( active ) and 4300s ( inactive ) and the corresponding state probabilities 0.2 and 0.8 , the estimated contribution @xmath80 .",
    "for the observed r.m.s .",
    "@xmath81ms , this implies @xmath82 , somewhat larger than values measured from intermittent pulsars ( 1.52.5 ) , implying other sources of timing noise are also important , though @xcite suggests that relative spindown rates may depend sensitively on small changes in magnetosphere geometry .    with the measurement of we",
    "can now place in the context of other nulling pulsars . despite having one of the highest known nfs ,",
    "the spindown luminosity ( @xmath83ergs@xmath11 ) and characteristic age ( 3.8myr ) of * are entirely unremarkable*. c.f . ,",
    "e.g. , table 1 of @xcite . on the other hand , @xcite , in an analysis of 43 nulling pulsars , found a strong ( but scattered ) correlation between nf and pulse period , and @xcite",
    "observe a modest correlation with age .",
    "thus , the high nf of is somewhat anomalous .",
    "as noted by @xcite , large nfs seems to occur at shallow magnetic inclinations , implying may have a magnetic inclination @xmath545 . excluding the very long nulling ( intermittent ) pulsars such as psr  b1931@xmath324 , also has one of the longest inactive periods .",
    "if , on the other hand , one only considers nulling within active periods , the nf drops to a much more modest 6.8% , in line with many of the other nullers .",
    "it is useful to compare directly with a few other high nf pulsars with long nulls .",
    "in particular , recent work by @xcite details the properties of psrs  j1738@xmath22330 and j1752@xmath32359 , both with nfs near 90% .",
    "strikingly , both pulsars exhibit features that seem to be absent in our similarly sensitive observations : correlated burst onsets , a decline in flux over time within a burst , and evidence of emission during the long nulls .",
    "in contrast , seems simply to switch on and off .",
    "likewise , psr  b1944@xmath317 @xcite sports a high ( nearly 70% ) nf with nulls up to @xmath0100 periods .",
    "its null frequency peaks at one rotation , however , suggesting the short nulls may be due to a carousel pattern .",
    "this may be the case for , though we have no additional evidence through subpulse structure .",
    "finally , it is also worth pointing out psr  j15025653 , a scaled doppelgnger of ; its @xmath84 and @xmath9 agree to within a factor of two , and its nf is similarly high , 93% @xcite .",
    "it , too , displays a pattern of ip / nulling ap , save with ip and ap durations scaled down by a factor of 10 , making it a tempting target for long - track study .    in conclusion ,",
    "we now have a detailed picture of on all timescales of interest and have also measured a panoply of important properties . substantial advance ",
    "e.g . , identifying pulse substructure  must likely await the the large collecting area of the ska , though some interim progress might be made with , e.g. , ultrawide bandwidth feeds , or with additional long - track observations .",
    "the identification of nulling at three timescales ( few pulses , tens of pulses , and thousands of pulses ) is challenging to interpret in any single picture , and we hope these observations will stimulate the introduction of new physical models for state switching .",
