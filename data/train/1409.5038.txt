    "the quark of mass around the 173 gev is assumed to be part of a fourth generation of quarks and leptons , while the sm top quark is heavier than 230 gev . even though by the time of the cdf and d0 measurements this model was strongly disfavored by the measurements of single top quark production ,",
    "the charge correlations between @xmath5-quark jets and @xmath2 bosons in @xmath132 events had not yet been definitively established by that time .",
    "therefore , it was worth of testing directly the hypothesis of an exotic quark decay .",
