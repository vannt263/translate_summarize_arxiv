    "molecular communication ( mc ) is a promising means of realizing nanonetworks and the internet of nano - bio things ( iobnt ) , which could find breakthrough applications in several domains , such as continuous health monitoring and smart drug delivery @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this bio - inspired method is mainly based on the use of molecules to encode , transmit and receive information .",
    "mc has been studied from several perspectives , including that of information theory @xcite , @xcite . however , except for a few studies , the design of transceiving units and corresponding physical limitations have been largely neglected in the literature",
    ". there exist mainly two approaches to design mc transceivers .",
    "the first approach is to use synthetic biology techniques for designing artificial cells capable of transmitting and receiving molecular messages @xcite .",
    "the second one is based on nanobioelectronic architectures which exploit the extraordinary properties of novel nanomaterials , such as nanowires and graphene , with a bio - inspired approach . in our recent review of design options for the mc receiver",
    ", we justify that nanobioelectronic designs are feasible and more convenient in most cases @xcite .",
    "electrical output of a nanobioelectronic receiver provides the advantage of high - speed information processing , making the design more suitable for the complex communication schemes and protocols developed for mc @xcite . in @xcite , we develop a communication theoretical model for a sinw fet - based mc receiver and obtain the noise statistics .",
    "this nanobioelectronic design , shown in fig . [ fig : molrec ] , is based on sinw fet biosensors ( biofets ) , which operate in a similar way to the conventional fets .",
    "a sinw biofet consists of a biorecognition layer of surface receptors capable of binding the target ligands and a sinw transducer channel which transduces the intrinsic charges of bound ligands into an electrical current flowing between the source and drain electrodes . in this paper",
    ", we develop an information theoretical model for a memoryless mc system equipped with the proposed sinw fet - based mc receiver .",
    "we derive analytical closed - form expressions for the mc capacity and capacity - achieving input distribution , following the methodology of @xcite .",
    "the resulting expressions incorporate the effect of transmitter , channel and receiver parameters , and could be used for optimizing the information flow in mc systems including nanobioelectronic receivers .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the existing model of mc system with a sinw fet - based receiver . the capacity is derived in section iii , and the results are provided in section iv .",
    "finally , the concluding remarks are given in section v.",
    "we consider a time - slotted mc system between a single transmitter nanomachine ( tx ) and a single receiver nanomachine ( rx ) .",
    "tx and rx are assumed to be perfectly synchronized with each other in terms of time .",
    "information is encoded into the number of molecules , i.e. , ligands , released by the tx .",
    "the channel is assumed to be memoryless .",
    "this can be practically realized with a low symbol rate or using auxiliary enzymes degrading the residual molecules that cause inter - symbol interference ( isi ) .",
    "the channel is assumed to be a free diffusion channel , where the trajectories of individual ligands are independent of each other .",
    "thus , the ligand concentration as a function of time and space can be expressed by the fick s equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the ligand concentration at location @xmath2 and time @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is the diffusion coefficient of the ligands .",
    "tx is assumed to be a point source located at the origin of 3d cartesian coordinate system , i.e. , @xmath5 .",
    "it releases @xmath6 number of molecules at the very beginning of a time slot .",
    "thus , we can express the initial condition as @xmath7 .",
    "assuming that the distance @xmath8 between the tx and rx surface is much higher than the largest dimension of the rx surface , we can consider that all of the surface receptors are at equal distance from tx , and thus , are exposed to the same ligand concentration , which can be obtained by solving the fick s equation at the rx location with the initial condition imposed by the tx : @xmath9 we assume that rx samples the occupation states of the receptors when the ligand concentration at the receiver location is at its maximum , which is the case when @xmath10 @xcite . the corresponding maximum ligand concentration at the rx location is then given by @xmath11 where we define @xmath12 as the channel attenuation parameter .",
    "the interaction of ligands with the surface receptors is governed by the ligand - receptor binding kinetics .",
    "assuming steady - state conditions , the probability of finding a single receptor at the bound state is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the unbinding rate constant for the receptor - ligand pair ; and @xmath15 is the binding rate constant in @xmath16 . generalizing the results to the case with @xmath17 receptors , and assuming that all of the receptors observe independent concentrations , the distribution of number of bound receptors becomes binomial @xcite : @xmath18 with mean and variance given by @xmath19 surface potential created on the nw - electrolyte interface as a result of binding of a single ligand",
    "is given as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the number of free electrons per ligand molecule , and @xmath22 is the equivalent capacitance of the transducer .",
    "@xmath23 is the mean effective charge of a free ligand electron , which is degraded as the distance between the ligand electron and the transducer increases due to the debye screening .",
    "the relation is given by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the elementary charge , and @xmath26 is the average distance of ligand electrons in the bound state to the transducer s surface @xcite , which is assumed to be equal to the average surface receptor length , i.e. , @xmath27 .",
    "the debye length , @xmath28 , quantizes the ionic strength of the medium according to @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the dielectric permittivity of the medium , @xmath31 is the boltzmann s constant , @xmath32 is the temperature , @xmath33 is avogadro s number , and @xmath34 is the ionic concentration of the medium @xcite .",
    "the transducer capacitance is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the diffusion layer capacitance resulting from the double layer created by the medium counterions accumulated at the interface between oxide layer , i.e. , sio@xmath37 layer , and the electrolyte medium ; @xmath38 is the capacitance of the oxide layer ; and @xmath39 is the sinw capacitance , which is again a double layer capacitance caused by the accumulation of carriers to the sio@xmath37/sinw interface @xcite , @xcite .    for a nanowire - on - insulator ( nwoi ) configuration of rx",
    ", we can consider the sinw as a hemicylinder with an oxide layer of thickness @xmath40 covering the surface , and a diffusion layer of thickness @xmath28 covering the oxide layer @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the diffusion layer capacitance can be given by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the effective width of sinw with radius @xmath43 , and @xmath44 is the sinw length .",
    "the oxide capacitance is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the permittivity and the thickness of the oxide layer , respectively .",
    "we will use @xmath47 to denote the oxide capacitance per area .",
    "for high values of hole density , e.g. , @xmath48 @xmath49 , corresponding to the linear operation regime of the fet , the @xmath39 is obtained as @xmath50 @xcite , where @xmath51 is the dielectric permittivity of sinw , and @xmath52 is the thickness of the double layer created in the inner surface of the nw , which is given by @xmath53 .",
    "the potential induced at the sinw / oxide layer interface is reflected into the output current of the rx .",
    "we assume that the p - type fet is operated in the linear ( ohmic ) region ; thus , its transconductance is expressed by @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the source to drain voltage of the sinw fet . given the transconductance ,",
    "the output current , @xmath56 , resulting from the surface potential generated by the bound ligands is given as @xmath57 , which has the mean @xmath58    the operation of biofet - based mc receiver is suffered from @xmath59 noise .",
    "based on _ the correlated carrier number and mobility fluctuation model _ , power spectral density ( psd ) of the @xmath59 noise at the output current can be written as @xmath60 ^ 2 , \\label{eq : is}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is source to gate voltage , and @xmath62 is the threshold voltage of the sinw fet .",
    "@xmath63 is the coulomb scattering coefficient , and @xmath64 is the mobility of the hole carriers @xcite .",
    "the psd of the flatband - voltage noise @xmath65 is given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the characteristic tunneling distance , @xmath68 is the oxide trap density , i.e. , impurity concentration , of the sinw channel @xcite .",
    "@xmath59 noise is independent of the received signals , and shows an additive behavior on the overall output current fluctuations .",
    "theoretically , @xmath59 noise does not have a low frequency cutoff , and has infinite power at zero frequency .",
    "however , in experimental studies with a finite measurement time , a finite variance for @xmath59 noise is observed .",
    "the reason is related to the low frequency cutoff set by the observation time @xmath69 @xcite . considering that the received molecular signals are at the baseband , to be able to calculate the total noise power , we assume one - year operation time , i.e. , @xmath70 s , for the antenna such that the low cutoff frequency is @xmath71 hz . at frequencies lower than @xmath72 ,",
    "the noise is assumed to show the white noise behavior , i.e. , @xmath73 for @xmath74 .",
    "@xmath75    we can expect that a significant number of receptors , e.g. @xmath76 , are tethered to the top surface of a sinw channel . for large number of surface receptors ,",
    "the binomial distribution given in can be approximated as gaussian , i.e. , @xmath77 .",
    "@xmath59 noise is resulting from the bias current flowing through sinw channel , thus , it is independent of the binding noise .",
    "it can be approximated to follow a gaussian distribution @xcite .",
    "therefore , the overall noise process effective on the output current becomes a stationary gaussian process with the variance @xmath78",
    "we consider the overall system as a continuous - input continuous - output memoryless channel .",
    "although information is encoded into discrete number of molecules , we can assume that the input is continuous given that it takes values from a very large input range .",
    "then , the mutual information between the transmitted signal @xmath79 and the received signal @xmath56 can be written as    @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 denote the minimum and maximum number of molecules that tx can transmit .",

    "in this section , we investigate the characteristics of the capacity - achieving input distribution and the effect of main system parameters on the capacity .",

    "the overall setting is the same as that used in @xcite .     and",
    "@xmath113.,width=264 ]    the capacity - achieving input distribution @xmath102 is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : capdist ] . as expected , the distribution is more focused around the minimum number of molecules @xmath82 tx transmits , which results in a less amount of noise in the receiver s electrical output .",
    "next , we analyze the relation between the upper limit @xmath82 of transmitted molecules and the capacity . as is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : capnmax ] , the capacity significantly increases with the increasing @xmath82 until it begins to saturate around 5 bits / use .",
    "this is originating from the fact that the receiver has a finite number of molecules ; thus , it becomes saturated when @xmath114 , resulting in a reduced receiver sensitivity .",
    "therefore , transmitting more molecules to increase the ligand concentration at the receiver location is not favorable when the receiver is saturated .",
    "the second analysis is carried out for varying tx - rx distance . as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : capd ] , the capacity is maximum at intermediate distances , e.g. , @xmath115 m , and begins to decrease when the distance is below or above this range . for a given @xmath82 ,",
    "as the distance gets smaller , the receiver begins to operate near saturation because @xmath116 significantly increases when the transmitter and receiver are close to each other .",
    "this is reflected to the output current , and results in a decrease in the sensitivity of the receiver so that it can not discriminate different levels of ligand concentration corresponding to different symbols . as a result , the capacity decreases . for large distances , the ligand concentration gets significantly attenuated in the channel , thus , the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) decreases @xcite , resulting in a lower capacity .",
    "the ionic strength of the fluidic medium also substantially affects the capacity , as is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : capcion ] .",
    "the debye length @xmath28 decreases with the increasing ionic concentration , implying more effective screening of ligand charges .",
    "this in turn reduces the snr , and thus , the capacity .",
    "physiological conditions generally imply ionic concentrations higher than 100 mol / m@xmath117 . to compensate the attenuation of capacity , surface receptors with lengths comparable to debye length should be selected .",
    "lastly , we analyze the capacity for varying oxide trap density @xmath68 , which is proportional to the impurity of the sinw .",
    "trap density affects the carrier mobility , and increases the @xmath59 noise .",
    "the negative effect of increasing trap density on the capacity is evident from fig .",
