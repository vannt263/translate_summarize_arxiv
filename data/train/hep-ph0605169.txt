    "i , the latter is not considered in the present work . however , to the extent that the kaons couple strongly to the ( high - mass ) spin-1/2 hyperon resonances , the features just discussed above for the beam asymmetry should hold .",
    "the same observation applies for the target asymmetry discussed below .",
    "for all the observables considered so far in the present work , the pv- and ps - coupling schemes give very similar results to each other , although the dynamical contents can differ substantially from each other .",
    "in particular , the dominant contribution to the total cross sections can arise either from the spin-1/2 or spin-3/2 hyperons depending on the choice of the pv- or ps - coupling at the @xmath39 vertex for spin-1/2 baryon @xmath40 and hyperon @xmath41 ( cf .",

    "note that the sensitivity to the ps - pv mixing parameter at backward angles is due to the strong @xmath18-channel @xmath19-exchange contribution and arises from the fact that the ps - coupling involves @xmath104 while the pv - coupling involves @xmath105 at the meson - baryon vertex .",
    "the latter leads to an amplitude which contains an extra @xmath106 factor as compared to the former choice .",
    "therefore , the target asymmetry offers a potential means of distinguishing the two types of couplings at the @xmath39 vertex .",

    "table  [ tbl : hyperons ] ) which may potentially affect the @xmath77 invariant mass distribution in this energy region .",

    "[ fig : dxsc_invmass_hmr ] and [ fig : dxsc_invmass_hmr_2 ] .",
    "however , as explained in the introduction , since there is no detailed dynamical information available about these resonances , their inclusion into our model would be very speculative and an investigation of the detailed effects of such higher - spin resonances should be left for future work .",
    "however , the question as to whether some resonance in the 2-gev region can fill the valley can be addressed qualitatively by simulating high - spin resonances by a _ fictitious _ hyperon resonance in this energy region . concretely , therefore , in addition to the known @xmath55 and @xmath56 states ( and the low - mass hyperons considered in the previous subsections ) , we employ a ( fictitious ) @xmath116 resonance with @xmath118 mev .",

    "[ fig : txsc_hmr_2 ] and [ fig : dxsc_hmr_2 ] .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : dxsc_invmass_hmr_3r ] , the bump structures indeed have disappeared completely due to the @xmath122 resonance whose contribution fills up the valley in the @xmath77 invariant mass around @xmath124 gev seen in figs .  [ fig : dxsc_invmass_hmr ] and [ fig : dxsc_invmass_hmr_2 ] .",
    "we may expect , therefore , that a similar effect will also occur when the known higher - spin resonances in this energy range are considered .",
    "these considerations show that the study of @xmath3 photoproduction may provide useful information about higher - mass hyperon resonances which makes it all the more desirable to have more rigorous investigations that provide a better understanding of the dynamics of such higher - mass and higher - spin resonances .",
    "in summary , we have explored the reaction @xmath0 within a relativistic meson - exchange model of hadronic interactions .",
    "this is the first theoretical investigation of this reaction in connection with the cascade spectroscopy program initiated recently by the clas collaboration at jlab  @xcite .",
    "most of the parameters of the model involving the low - mass hyperons in the intermediate states were determined from the empirical data and/or quark models and su(3 ) symmetry considerations .",
    "it is found that the dominant reaction mechanism arising from those low - mass hyperons is the radiative transitions [ cf .",
    "[ fig : diagram](d ) with @xmath68 ] , especially , for producing the @xmath72 in the @xmath2 reaction , which is currently under investigation by the clas collaboration at jlab  @xcite .",
    "this production mechanism is also found to lead to a forward- ( backward- ) peaked angular distribution of the produced @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) .",
    "we have also explored the possible influence of the higher - mass hyperons in @xmath0 , which are expected to contribute more significantly to this reaction than the low - mass hyperons because they are energetically more favored than the latter resonances .",
    "the difficulty in quantifying the contributions from these high - mass hyperons is the complete lack of information about the strengths of their couplings to the cascade baryons .",
    "nevertheless , we have shown that these high - mass resonances may lead to a dominance of the @xmath18-channel @xmath19-exchange mechanism for producing the cascade baryons . moreover ,",
    "the angular distribution of the produced @xmath72 and the photon asymmetry in @xmath2 were shown to offer two independent ways of possibly distinguishing between the @xmath18-channel @xmath19-exchange and the radiative transitions as the dominant mechanisms for @xmath72 photoproduction .",
    "the target asymmetry was also shown to possibly impose constraints on the ps - pv mixing parameter at the @xmath39 vertex involving spin-1/2 baryons .",
    "in addition , the @xmath77 invariant - mass distribution in @xmath125 yields a clear information on the high - mass hyperon resonance contributions .",
    "however , care must be taken to avoid misidentifying the second bump structure , which is kinematic in origin , with the formation of a higher - mass resonance during the reaction .",
    "moreover , the non - existence of the bump structure in the @xmath77 invariant mass distribution may happen due to the overlap of broad resonances as we have explicitly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dxsc_invmass_hmr_3r ] .",
    "these findings show that @xmath3 photoproduction is indeed well suited for investigating the properties of higher - mass hyperon resonances .",
    "we conclude from the present work that one needs to consider concomitantly not only the total cross sections and their angular distributions but also other observables , such as invariant - mass distributions , beam asymmetries , and target asymmetries , in order to learn about the cascade photoproduction reaction .",
    "this is required , especially when the reaction mechanism is unclear as in the current case .",
    "these observables have different role in identifying the production mechanisms .",
    "finally , the present effort is just a first step toward building a more complete and realistic model for describing cascade baryon photoproduction off nucleons .",
    "our findings should be useful for future investigation of this reaction both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "experimentally , we are aware of that the clas collaboration is currently analyzing the @xmath2 reaction and extracting the angular distributions of @xmath72 and @xmath73 as well as the @xmath77 and @xmath78 invariant - mass distributions  @xcite in addition to the total cross sections",
    ". as we have shown , these observables will certainly be very important in learning about this reaction .",
    "also , it would be very interesting to have the beam and target asymmetries measured in future experiments . studying the reaction channels other than @xmath2",
    "is also required , for these will help disentangle the isoscalar @xmath16 and isovector @xmath10 hyperon contributions .",
    "theoretically , we should investigate the effects of the other higher - mass baryon resonances , not only those of the rather well - established @xmath126 and -@xmath127 resonances that have been neglected in the present study but , especially , those of higher - spin ( spin-5/2 and -7/2 ) resonances ( cf .",
