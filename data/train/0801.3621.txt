    "the famous spin - statistics theorem relates the exchange statistics of a quantum field with the spin of its elementary excitations  @xcite .",
    "namely , it states that in the case of bose / fermi ( para- ) statistics there holds @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the spin of the particles and @xmath2 is the statistics parameter of the fields .",
    "it has found in  @xcite a derivation from first principles without any non - observable quantities such as charge - carrying fields . however , a basic input to this derivation was that the charge be localizable in bounded regions .",
    "in  @xcite , buchholz and epstein extended the theorem to massive particles carrying a non - localizable charge . in the purely massive case , such charges are still localizable in space - like cones  @xcite , i.e. , cones in spacetime which extend to space - like infinity .",
    "where @xmath3 is the apex of @xmath4 and @xmath5 is a double cone whose closure does not contain the origin . ]",
    "the analysis of buchholz and epstein was carried out in four - dimensional spacetime , in which case @xmath2 is a real number associated with a unitary representation of the permutation group ( @xmath6 corresponding to bosons and @xmath7 corresponding to fermions ) . in three - dimensional spacetime , however , it may occur that the permutation group is replaced by the braid group , in which case the statistics parameter is a complex non - real number .",
    "the phase in its polar decomposition is called the statistics phase @xmath8 , @xmath9 in the case of non - real @xmath2 ( i.e.  @xmath10 ) one speaks of braid group statistics and calls the particles plektons or , if the corresponding representation is abelian , anyons . related to this phenomenon , in three - dimensional spacetime the spin of a particle needs not be integer or half - integer , but may assume any real value ( `` fractional '' spin ) .",
    "in fact , the occurrence of braid group statistics is equivalent to the occurrence of `` fractional '' spin .    in the present article",
    ", we prove that in this case the spin - statistics relation @xmath11 holds , starting from first principles and only assuming the following conditions on the mass spectrum .",
    "we consider a charged sector of a local relativistic quantum theory in three - dimensional minkowski space , containing a massive particle with mass @xmath12 and spin @xmath13 .",
    "we assume that @xmath14 is separated from the rest of the mass spectrum in its sector by a mass gap .",
    "we further assume that there are only finitely many `` particle types '' in its sector with this mass , and that they all have the same spin @xmath1 . as a byproduct ,",
    "we prove that the familiar symmetry between particles and antiparticles holds also in this case : namely , that there is an equal number of antiparticle types ( in the conjugate sector ) with the same mass which all have the same spin @xmath13 ( proposition  [ antipart ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that a `` weak spin - statistics relation '' , @xmath15 is known to hold  @xcite under quite general conditions in the case of braid group statistics .",
    "it should also be noted that the strong spin - statistics relation   has been proved in  @xcite and in  @xcite , but under a non - trivial hypothesis ammounting to the bisognano - wichmann property , or modular covariance , of the charged fields  @xcite or the observables  @xcite , respectively . in the present paper",
    "we do not need this hypothesis .",
    "in fact , we shall show in a subsequent paper  @xcite that the bisognano - wichmann property may be derived from first principles in a purely massive theory with braid group statistics , using the results of our present analyisis .",
    "our derivation will largely parallel that of buchholz and epstein  @xcite .",
    "the crucial difference between the four - dimensional case considered in @xcite and the present three - dimensional case lies in the structure of the poincar group and the irreducible massive representations of its universal covering group , which have been heavily used in  @xcite .",
    "in particular , in four dimensions one has the so - called `` covariant representation '' , in which locally generated single particle wave functions have certain analyticity properties which are exploited in the proof . in three dimensions ,",
    "however , there is no `` covariant represention '' , and in the well - known wigner representation the wave functions are _ not _ analytic . as a way out , we use here an equivalent representation found by the author in @xcite , which exhibits precisely the required analyticity properties . on the other hand ,",
    "the representation of the translation subgroup in three dimensions does not differ essentially from that in four dimensions .",
    "hence the results from  @xcite which use only the translations can directly be adapted to the three - dimensional case .",
