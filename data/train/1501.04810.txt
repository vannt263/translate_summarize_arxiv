    "concurrently , the time averaged msd exhibits an intermediate plateau . in the presence of aging , we observe a deviation from the non - aged power - law behavior of the ensemble averaged msd at longer times and a universal convergence to a plateau value . for strong aging",
    ", we again observe the convergence of ensemble and time averaged msds .",
    "we note that the behavior of confined ctrw is opposite : the time averaged msd exhibits a power - law growth with exponent @xmath126 , while the ensemble averaged msd converges to the thermal plateau value @xcite .",
    "in addition to these quantities we considered the first passage time density in the semi - infinite domain .",
    "in contrast to the non - aging fractional brownian motion we found a crossover between two characteristic scaling laws depending on the competition between aging and process time , @xmath18 and @xmath21 .",
    "when using sbm as a stochastic model cognizance should be taken of the fact that it is a highly non - stationary process .",
    "the time dependence of its diffusivity corresponds to a time dependent temperature ( noise strength ) , and is therefore physically meaningless as description for a system coupled to a thermostat .",
    "there exist , however , cases , in which sbm may turn out to be a physically meaningful approach . for instance",
    ", it was demonstrated that sbm provides a useful mean field description for the motion of a tagged particle in a granular gas with a sub - unity restitution coefficient in the homogeneous cooling phase @xcite .",
    "a number of aging features are quite similar between subdiffusive ctrws @xcite , heterogeneous diffusion processes @xcite , and aging sbm , as shown here . while fractional brownian motion is ergodic",
    ", transient deviations from ergodicity and transient aging occur under confinement @xcite . to reliably distinguish these models from another , it is therefore imperative to employ other diagnostic stochastic quantities with characteristic behaviors for the respective processes @xcite .",
