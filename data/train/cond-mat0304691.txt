    "the statistical approach to the study of the quantum spectra of complex hamiltonians @xmath2 was pioneered in the 1950 s in connection with the study of resonances in nuclear scattering  @xcite .",
    "the approach was formalized by dyson  @xcite , who identified three universal types of spectral statistics as determined by the symmetry properties of the corresponding ensembles of random hamiltonians .",
    "the theory of wigner and dyson , together with its extensions , is usually referred to as random matrix theory ( rmt ) . within rmt ,",
    "spectral correlations of each type ( symmetry class ) of statistics are described by the corresponding set of universal functions , once the energies are rescaled by the average level spacing @xmath4 .",
    "the latter is the _ only _ non - universal parameter of the theory , where non - universality implies dependence on the specifics ( other than the symmetry class ) of the distribution functions defining the hamiltonian ensemble .",
    "the symmetry classes are labeled by the index @xmath5 which takes the values @xmath6 for real ( time - invariant ) hamiltonians ( so - called orthogonal class ) , @xmath7 for complex hamiltonians ( unitary class ) , and @xmath8 for hamiltonians with broken spin - rotation symmetry ( symplectic class ) .",
    "for example , in the unitary class ( @xmath7 ) , the normalized two - point correlation function of the density of states ( dos ) , @xmath9 , @xmath10 can be expressed as @xmath11 where @xmath12 @xmath13 , and where @xmath14 . the delta function in",
    "represents the autocorrelation of an energy level with itself ; the constant term is the disconnected contribution , and the oscillating term corresponds to non - trivial correlations between different levels .",
    "similar , although slightly more convoluted , expressions are well known for other symmetry classes .",
    "as became clear in the subsequent development of the theory , wigner - dyson statistics possesses a remarkable universality : beyond the manifestly model constructions of rmt , wigner - dyson statistics occurs both in quantum weakly disordered systems  @xcite @xmath15 , where the statistical description follows naturally from the ensemble of realizations of the disordered part of the hamiltonian @xmath16 , as well as in _ individual _ classically chaotic hamiltonians  @xcite upon averaging over a sufficiently wide spectral window .",
    "the status of the last two statements is somewhat different : while the former has been rigorously established  @xcite , the latter statement is known as the bohigas - giannoni - schmit ( bgs )  @xcite _ conjecture_. crucially , the existence of a statistical ensemble allows average properties of the disordered hamiltonian to be formulated in the framework of a quantum field theory of nonlinear sigma model type ( nl@xmath1 m ) valid in the limit @xmath17 . here",
    ", the dimensionless conductance @xmath18 denotes a non - universal parameter which depends on the deterministic part of the hamiltonian @xmath19  and through it on the sample geometry  as well as on details of the distribution of @xmath16 .",
    "by contrast , properties of an individual system are much less amenable to treatment by means of a statistical field theory and , despite recent encouraging progress  @xcite , a convincing formal proof of the bgs conjecture is lacking .",
    "the existence of a proof of wigner - dyson statistics in quantum disordered systems generates a dichotomy of approaches : if universality is _ assumed _ or established by other means , rmt calculations can be employed to obtain specific answers . on the other hand , nl@xmath1 m calculations often represent the only available route to _ establish _ universality and to explore deviations from it ( typically as expansions in @xmath20 ) .",
    "a corollary of the above universality is the fact that , apart form a possible modification of the average dos @xmath21 , the spectral statistics of @xmath22 and @xmath23 are indistinguishable @xcite unless @xmath0 is so large that @xmath24 generate only perturbative corrections to its eigenvalues ( the same condition , of course , applies to the relation between @xmath19 and @xmath16 ) .",
    "such universality dictates that the statistics of spectral lines tracing the evolution of eigenvalues as functions of a coordinate @xmath25 along a typical curve in the hamiltonian space connecting @xmath19 to @xmath26 must possess some kind of stationarity @xcite .",
    "this stationarity is reflected , in turn , in the universality of parametric spectral correlations @xcite ( i.e. cross - correlations between the spectra of @xmath2 and @xmath27 averaged over the realizations of @xmath16 ) . indeed , as first pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , for a broad class of @xmath0 s the parametric spectral correlators are expressed via another set of universal functions ( again determined only by the symmetry of the hamiltonian ensemble ) which depend , in addition to the level density , on a _ single _ extra non - universal parameter  the dispersion @xmath28 of the distribution of level velocities @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a typical eigenlevel of @xmath2 .",
    "( the use of the notation @xmath28 for the dispersion of the distribution of level velocities is explained by the fact that it is the limiting value of the level velocity correlation function @xmath31 @xcite . )",
    "if the curve is a ` straight line ' @xmath32 , the rescaled parameter @xmath33 is an effective measure of the strength of @xmath34 .",
    "eq .   is , in essence , a relation between two phenomenological parameters , @xmath35 and @xmath28 .",
    "it is supplemented by a ` microscopic ' definition of @xmath35 in terms of @xmath34  @xcite @xmath36 where the double angle brackets denote the matrix element of @xmath37 on the vector space spanned by @xmath0 , and the definition of the ( non - universal ) operator @xmath37 strongly depends on @xmath19 and the distribution of @xmath38 . in a disordered metal",
    ", @xmath37 becomes a resolvent of the diffusion operator  @xcite , and , if @xmath0 is diagonal in the coordinate representation , the matrix element simplifies to @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the matrix element of @xmath37 in the coordinate basis , @xmath41 is the linear size of the sample , and @xmath42 are the space dimensions .",
    "the parameter @xmath35 can be thought of as a scalar norm ( in the space of hamiltonians ) of the ` distance ' between @xmath2 and @xmath43 , and eq .",
    "can correspondingly be viewed as fixing a particular prescription for the norm .    the importance of eq",
    "is underscored by the fact that in practice , measuring @xmath0 directly is often impossible or very difficult , and the green function of the diffusion operator is itself a complicated object in an irregularly shaped sample .",
    "consequently , direct evaluation of   is seldom feasible . on the other hand",
    ", collecting statistics on level velocities is relatively straightforward , so that eq .",
    "is the _ only _ link between the formal parameter @xmath35 and an experimentally measurable quantity .",
    "[ a brief remark on notation : we denote the parametric perturbation as @xmath34 whenever the emphasis is on the continuous evolution of the spectrum of @xmath43 as a function of @xmath25 along a ` straight line ' @xmath44 . in",
    "what follows non - linear parameter dependence of @xmath0 will become important , so it will be convenient to revert to denoting the perturbation as @xmath0 with its parameter dependence implicit from the context . ]",
    "the ` broad class of @xmath0 s ' which was referred to above is distinguished by the following properties .",
    "first of all , the main feature of the class of @xmath0 s to which the theory of refs .",
    "@xcite applies is that the level velocity distribution is gaussian , and is thus fully characterized by its second cumulant .",
    "it is , of course , generic in some sense , as the gaussianity of the level velocity distribution is the result of the central limit theorem which comes into force for any @xmath0 which is _ global _ , or _",
    "extended _ ,",
    "i.e. when @xmath0 is a generic ` full ' matrix in the hilbert space defined by a typical realization of @xmath45 ( a more formal definition is @xmath46 in the thermodynamic limit ) .",
    "in application to disordered metals , such perturbations are easily realized as , e. g. , inhomogeneous electric or magnetic fields acting on the whole , or a substantial part of , the sample volume .",
    "secondly , the fact that @xmath35 is linear in @xmath25 implies that @xmath0 is , in some sense , small .",
    "more precisely , individual matrix elements of @xmath0 are small as compared to the mean level spacing @xmath4 , even as the overall effect of @xmath0 is finite due to its global extent",
    ". it can not be too strongly emphasized that , for a global perturbation , the requirement that its matrix elements are small is not an artificial constraint , but a self - consistent condition for the existence of finite correlations between the spectra of @xmath2 and @xmath47 : if this condition is violated , the spectrum of @xmath47 is so ` scrambled ' with respect to the spectrum of @xmath2 that the residual correlations vanish as inverse powers of the system volume .",
    "there exists , however , a class of perturbations @xmath0 which do nt quite fall into the paradigm of refs .  @xcite . in many practical applications , for example",
    ", @xmath0 can not be characterized as extended . a bistable defect jumping between two nearby configurations , a local stm tip , defects created under irradiation , etc . ,",
    "belong to a very different type of a perturbing hamiltonian . on an intuitive level",
    "they are easily seen to be ` local ' , and formally @xmath48 is finite for such perturbations .",
    "even more crucially , the corresponding distribution of level velocities is not gaussian [ e.g. , it is poissonian for a moving local defect in a disordered metal for @xmath7 , see eq .",
    "below ] , so the results of refs .",
    "@xcite need to be modified .",
    "parametric spectral correlations induced by non - extended perturbing potentials have been studied previously in the rmt framework @xcite , leading to a comprehensive set of results for a large class of parametric correlation functions in the unitary ensemble . as noted above",
    ", the use of rmt presupposes universality . at the same time , matrix elements of a local perturbation need not be small . as a typical example",
    ", let us consider the potential arising in the x - ray emission / absorption spectra in disordered metals , and the associated issue of anderson orthogonality catastrophe  @xcite .",
    "the potential @xmath49 of a charged ion created after an electron has been knocked out of an inner shell by a photon may typically have a magnitude comparable to the fermi energy @xmath50 and a spatial extent of the order of the fermi wavelength @xmath51 . for comparison , an example of a global potential to which analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite fully applies is external magnetic field generating a unit of flux through the sample area .",
    "the corresponding effective potential is easily estimated as @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the vector potential . in the former case ,",
    "the potential , although spatially localized , is larger by a factor of square root of the sample volume ( in @xmath54 dimensions ) .",
    "the qualitative difference between the two types of perturbations is vividly illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : rankn ] and  [ fig : levr2 ] which depict the evolution of a set of levels of a typical realization of @xmath55 as a function of @xmath25 for the cases of global and local perturbations , respectively .",
    "note , for example , that in the case of a local perturbation , even very large values of @xmath25 do not lead to a complete ` scrambling ' of the spectrum .",
    "lattice as a function of the strength @xmath25 of a fixed global perturbation ( arbitrary units ) . to place the system in the unitary symmetry class , we have imposed an external random vector potential in addition to the random scalar potential . ]",
    "lattice as a function of the overall strength @xmath25 of an external perturbation localized on two fixed sites ( arbitrary units ) . ]    given these qualitative differences , the universality of the corresponding parametric correlations can not be automatically deduced from the analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we utilize the nl@xmath1 m approach to prove the universality of the results in  @xcite and to establish their limits of applicability and , crucially , their parametrization in terms of non - universal ( @xmath19-dependent ) quantities .",
    "we also establish a precise criterion for the crossover between the localized @xcite and extended @xcite regimes .",
    "the nl@xmath1 m also affords an extension of some of the previously obtained results to the orthogonal ensemble , although a complete counterpart of the results of refs . @xcite in the orthogonal case is unattainable at present .",
    "the parametric analog of eq .    and the basic object to which we devote most of the attention in this paper  is the cross - correlation function @xmath56 where @xmath57 .",
    "the notation is dictated by the fact that @xmath58 is the special case of the multi - point correlation function @xmath59 involving @xmath60 densities @xmath61 and @xmath62 ` shifted ' densities @xmath63 .",
    "( within this classification scheme , @xmath64 is more properly denoted as @xmath65 . ) its universal form ( in the case of random hamiltonians of unitary symmetry ) is given , as established in refs .",
    "@xcite for global @xmath0 , by the following expression : @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath35 is given by eq .  .",
    "note that the resolvent of the diffusion operator @xmath68 is a long - range object , so that the extended character of @xmath0 is essential in the structure of eq .  .",
    "note also that @xmath37 is smooth on the scale of the mean free path @xmath69 , suppressing the contribution of the fast components of @xmath0 to  .",
    "the basic conclusion of the analysis presented in this paper is that in the case of a local perturbation ( or a perturbation which has both global and local components ) the overall structure of eq .   is preserved ,",
    "while the function @xmath70 is generalized to @xmath71 \\ ; , \\label{eq : sgene}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where the ` local ' part @xmath72 of @xmath1 depends on a vector of parameters @xmath73 .",
    "the vector @xmath73 has a finite number @xmath74 of components , reflecting the finite extent of the local component of @xmath0 .",
    "we also find an additional contribution to @xmath75 , which properly accounts for the fast spatial oscillations in the extended parts of @xmath0 , @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the average local dos in a @xmath42-dimensional sample .",
    "the friedel function @xmath78 represents the averaged green function of a disordered system , and is given by @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the bessel function of @xmath81-th order . in",
    "what sense is eq .",
    "universal , depending , as it does , on a whole list of parameters ? to answer this question one needs to clarify whether analogs of eq .",
    "can be defined , i.e. , whether these correlation functions are determined by an ( at most finite ) set of phenomenological parameters rather than the thermodynamically large number of variables in the pair of matrices @xmath19 and @xmath0 .    as will be explained",
    "shortly , @xmath82 are nonlinear functions of @xmath34 . in other words",
    ", the transformation analogous to  , if it exists at all , is _ non - linear _  in contrast to the simple rescaling required in the global case .",
    "the nonlinearity means that , unlike the case of a global perturbation , the overall magnitude of the perturbation @xmath25 is no longer a ` natural ' variable with respect to which level velocity should be defined .",
    "it is not even _ a priori _ clear that such a ` natural ' variable exists .",
    "there is , however , an extra requirement that can be imposed to make the parametrization unique . to help motivate it ,",
    "let us note that , in the global case , @xmath1 as a function of @xmath35 is essentially a taylor expansion where terms of the order higher than @xmath83 vanish in the thermodynamic limit . as a result ,",
    "correlation functions between @xmath84 and @xmath85 for arbitrary @xmath86 and @xmath87 are functions of the ( properly rescaled ) difference @xmath88 .",
    "this translationally invariant parametrization is a direct consequence  in fact , the primary manifestation  of the principle of stationarity discussed in the introduction . on general grounds ,",
    "such stationarity should characterize parametric correlations induced by local perturbations as well .",
    "thus , there must exist a ` natural ' set of variables @xmath89 possessing the following property : there is at least one curve connecting @xmath19 and @xmath90 such that the correlations between any two hamiltonians on this curve corresponding to two different values @xmath86 and @xmath87 are functions of the differences @xmath91 .",
    "the distribution of level velocities along this curve is independent of the position on the curve .",
    "in fact , for @xmath92 , such curves are not unique , but rather span an @xmath74-dimensional manifold .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the existence of such parametrization is a non - trivial property even for a single parameter ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "for example , let us consider an arbitrary function @xmath94 .",
    "the existence of a ` natural ' set of variables is equivalent to the requirement that for _ any _ @xmath86 and @xmath87 the function @xmath95 can be represented as @xmath96 for some functions @xmath18 and @xmath97 .",
    "such a representation clearly exists only for a very restricted subset of all possible @xmath98 .",
    "as follows from the analysis below , the ` natural ' parametrization does indeed exist , and it is effected by the substitution @xmath99 as will be shown in section  [ sec : ftheo ] , @xmath82 are the eigenvalues of the _ reactance matrix _",
    "@xmath100 where the scattering matrix @xmath101 describes scattering off @xmath0 with free propagation controlled by the green function of @xmath102 averaged over @xmath16 .",
    "the emergence of the reactance matrix as a key object governing parametric correlations is rather natural within the formal framework presented in the subsequent section .",
    "however , it is less obvious on an intuitive level , especially so since the reactance matrix is used much less frequently in the scattering theory proper than its ` cousin ' the @xmath103-matrix ( a very detailed exposition of the subject can be found , however , in  @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , it can be qualitatively understood based precisely on the fact that reactance matrix is the hermitian analog of the @xmath103-matrix .",
    "indeed , the latter is conventionally defined by the equation @xmath104 is the scattered wave , normalized to _",
    "unit flux_. similarly , @xmath105 satisfies an equation of identical structure , @xmath106 , where @xmath107 and @xmath108 are now the conventionally normalized respectively , perturbed , and unperturbed , states in a _ closed system_. since we consider the parametric correlations of the real eigenvalues of hermitian hamiltonians in closed systems , reactance matrix is indeed quite a natural object to appear .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath105 are expressed as tangents of the corresponding eigenphases ( scattering phase shifts ) of @xmath101 .",
    "the parameters @xmath109 introduced in eq .",
    "thus have an intuitive physical interpretation as the corresponding phase shifts .",
    "the expression of @xmath82 ( or @xmath109 ) in terms of the reactance matrix should be regarded as the analog of the microscopic definition of @xmath35 given by eq .  .",
    "moreover , the fact that the natural parameters are the eigenvalues of the corresponding reactance matrix allows for a more direct definition of the special set of curves in the space of hamiltonians which were discussed above .",
    "these curves can now be represented as sequences of hamiltonians which map onto _ commuting _ sequences of reactance matrices .",
    "it is possible to complete the analogy with the case of extended perturbations by establishing a counterpart of eq .  .",
    "the distribution @xmath110 of level velocities @xmath111 can be extracted from eq .   with the help of the identity  @xcite : @xmath112 making use of this identity , one obtains the following result @xmath113 where @xmath114 .",
    "thus , the cumulants @xmath115 of the level velocity are given by @xmath116 by choosing @xmath117 as the variable , we have already effectively performed a rescaling analogous to   ( up to a factor of @xmath118 ) , with @xmath119 .",
    "any set of additional @xmath120 cumulants is sufficient to invert eq .  , thus providing the remaining ( non - linear ) variable transformations between phenomenological constants @xmath115 and universal parameters @xmath109 .",
    "equation   establishes the universality of eq .  .",
    "although we have kept the discussion above rather general , the most interesting application from the practical point view is when @xmath0 is diagonal in the coordinate representation , and @xmath19 and @xmath16 together describe weakly disordered metals .",
    "the latter are characterized by the hierarchy of scales @xmath121 . in this case",
    "it is convenient to distinguish two subtypes of local perturbations @xmath0 . in the first subtype ,",
    "the spatial extent @xmath122 of @xmath0 is smaller than @xmath69 . for such perturbing potentials , eq .",
    "can be more compactly rewritten as @xmath123 where @xmath105 is the reactance matrix projected onto the fermi surface , and @xmath124 denotes the trace in the space of the scattering channels .",
    "the full reactance matrix is defined by the equation @xmath125 where the retarded average green function is defined as @xmath126 , so that @xmath127 is formally distinct from the _ average reactance matrix _ @xmath128 ; nevertheless the difference between @xmath127 and the average reactance matrix enters only in the subleading order in @xmath129 , and can be ignored . transforming to the momentum representation it is convenient to split off the angular variables in @xmath127 as @xmath130 , where @xmath131 .",
    "the projected reactance matrix @xmath105 is defined as @xmath132 .    in the opposite limit @xmath133 ,",
    ".   retains its structure provided @xmath105 is replaced with @xmath134 @xmath135 is the mean free time , and the trace operation @xmath124 is redefined to include the @xmath136 degrees of freedom . in other words , the projection onto the fermi surface is smeared over a strip of width @xmath137 around it , reflecting the fact that the _ average _ green function exponentially decays over distances larger than @xmath69 so that a scatterer of size larger than @xmath69 is effectively split into independent chunks of size @xmath69 . since the algebraic structure of the parametric correlation functions is identical in both cases @xmath138 and @xmath139 , below we will often omit the subscript @xmath140 .    in summary , the two ways of defining @xmath141 either in terms of the solutions of eq .   or as the eigenphases of the reactance matrix stand in direct correspondence with the definition of @xmath35 either phenomenologically   or microscopically  .",
    "while very convenient for theoretical analysis , the definition in terms of the eigenphases is of little practical utility since measuring @xmath105 is hardly feasible . on the other hand , cumulants of the level velocity distribution are readily accessible in appropriately designed experiments",
    "the universality of the parametric correlation functions is explicitly demonstrated through the existence of their _ translationally invariant parametrization in terms of the scattering phase shifts .",
    "_ in this context , the standard universal wigner - dyson statistics of energy levels ( _ spectral points _ ) could be viewed as the _ boundary condition _ to the universal statistics of _ spectral lines _ as functions of coordinates in the space of hamiltonians .",
    "all of the preceding discussion can be applied verbatim to the case of orthogonal symmetry provided eqs .   and",
    "are replaced with    @xmath142    where @xmath143 and the global and local parts of @xmath144 are given by , respectively , @xmath145 and @xmath146 as before , @xmath105 has to be replaced with @xmath147 with the corresponding redefinition of @xmath124 if @xmath148 .    a similar set of expressions",
    "can also be written in the symplectic ( @xmath8 ) case .",
    "applying eq .",
    "to eq .  , we find that eq",

    "although a specific model of @xmath19 and @xmath16 was used in the calculation , the results are valid for any disordered system whose spectral statistics exhibit the wigner - dyson phenomenology , since the only crucial ` ingredients ' in the derivation were the existence of a unique zero mode in the nl@xmath1 m description , and a clear distinction between massive and soft modes .",
    "the results are also valid for generic chaotic systems , although a special consideration may be needed to properly take into account the contribution from the lyapunov region to the non - universal terms  @xcite .",

    "thus , all dependence on the ` reference ' hamiltonian @xmath19 is excluded from the result : parametric correlations between _ any _ @xmath433 and @xmath434 are parametrized by the eigenphases of the scattering matrix off the potential @xmath435 with @xmath433 playing the role of the unperturbed hamiltonian ( or , equivalently , scattering off @xmath436 with @xmath434 as the unperturbed background ) .    in the two - point case , as we have just shown , the correlation functions between _ two _ hamiltonians @xmath437 and @xmath438 depend on a _ single _ reactance matrix @xmath424 . at the same time , the action   suitable for the calculation of a generic @xmath249-point correlation function involving @xmath60 different values of the perturbing potential @xmath250 apparently depends on the full complement of @xmath60 reactance matrices @xmath439 . on the other hand , a straightforward generalization of the notion of translational invariance in the space of hamiltonians from two - point functions discussed in the introduction to the general case immediately leads to the conclusion that such correlation functions should depend only on the @xmath440 ` mutual ' reactance matrices which can be chosen as , _ e.g. _ , @xmath441 , @xmath442 .    in the absence of an explicit parametrization of the @xmath443 @xmath339-matrices ,",
    "it is not possible to perform a calculation analogous to the one in section  [ sec : genra ] to demonstrate that this is indeed the case .",
    "however , such a calculation is , in fact , not necessary .",
    "the translational invariance can be inferred instead from the analysis of the massive modes in section  [ sec : massi ] .",
    "indeed , it was shown there that locally strong perturbations do not lead to significant coupling between massive and soft modes .",

    "using the fourier transforms @xmath456 we immediately recover eqs .   and  , where @xmath82 are the eigenvalues of @xmath127 .",
    "it is intriguing that the supersymmetric structure involving the pair of compact ( @xmath176 ) and non - compact ( @xmath457 ) variables is reproduced under the guise of the dual pair @xmath458 as a result of the rmt analysis based solely on the method of orthogonal polynomials @xcite .",
