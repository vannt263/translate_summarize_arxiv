    "hierarchical accretion and merging of small clumps appears to be a good description of the formation of early - type galaxies . in many early - type galaxies signatures of recent hierarchical assembly",
    "can be observed , particularly in field galaxies .",
    "optical fine structure -shells , dust lanes , `` x ''",
    "structures- revealed through un - sharp masking of optical images suggests a recent accretion event .",
    "these fine structures are correlated with the presence of an intermediate age ( 1 - 2 gyr ) population of stars ( e.g.  schweizer et al .  1990 ) . moreover , comparing detailed stellar population models with high signal - to - noise optical spectra indicates the presence of an intermediate age population in several early - type galaxies ( e.g.  trager et al .",
    "a small but significant fraction of early - type galaxies contain neutral hydrogen .",
    "the origin of this neutral hydrogen is generally thought to be external and due to recent accretion of companions . hence the presence of  in early - type galaxies is generally thought to fit into the picture of continued accretion of companions and the associated intermittent episodes of star formation in some early - type galaxies .",
    "we are undertaking a systematic  survey , using the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) , of _ all _ early - type galaxies south of @xmath3 with@xmath4 km s@xmath5 ( based on hipass , the parkes all sky survey , see barnes et al . 2001 and elsewhere in this volume ) to obtain an unbiased sample of -rich early - type galaxies .",
    "such a complete sample will allow us to study the effects of  on the evolution of early - type galaxies in different environments , and the relation between  and other indicators of recent accretion and star formation ( see also sadler et al .",
    "we can also study whether  always has an external origin in early - type galaxies or whether in some early - type galaxies the  may be related to an earlier phase in the evolution of the galaxies .    during this",
    "hipass follow - up program we discovered two intergalactic  regions near the field elliptical ngc 1490 that are probably related to merging / accretion within the loose group of galaxies around ngc  1490 , or to the merger that created the field elliptical ngc  1490 .",
    "although unusual , these regions seem to fit into the generally accepted picture regarding  in early - type galaxies .",
    "we discuss these regions in section 2 .",
    "however , we find some evidence that some early - type galaxies do not fit into the scheme of continued accretion .",
    "this we briefly discuss in section 3 .",
    "the hipass spectrum of ngc  1490 shows a strong detection with the presence of almost @xmath6 m@xmath1 of neutral hydrogen .",
    "this detection was followed up with deep  observations performed with the atca to image the  in the region around ngc 1490 .",
    "five objects were detected with a total  mass of @xmath7 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "only one  cloud has an obvious counterpart ( cloud 4 ) on the digital sky survey in the form of a small galaxy .",
    "the other  clouds seem to lie along an arc of more than 500 kpc long that bends around ngc  1490 .",
    "about half of the total amount of  is found in one cloud of about 100 kpc in size ( cloud 1 ) .",
    "2 shows a position - velocity plot of two  clouds , as marked in fig .  1 .",
    "the kinematics of the clouds indicates that they are separate entities .",
    "e.g.  the velocity gradient in cloud 3 is perpendicular to the line connecting the neighbouring clouds .",
    "the `` u - shaped '' pattern observed in the largest  cloud indicates that this cloud is not in rotational equilibrium .",
    "deep optical imaging was performed in a number of standard filters of the region of this largest  cloud , using fors1 on the vlt .",
    "this imaging reveals a very low surface brightness optical counterpart ( the `` oc '' ) .",
    "the peak surface brightness in the v band is 24.5 v mag arcsec@xmath8 .",
    "the low surface brightness nature of the oc is illustrated in fig .",
    "the total magnitude is about 20.5 in v. this implies an extremely high gas - to - light ratio of @xmath9 . for the colour indices we find u@xmath10 , b@xmath11 v@xmath12 and r@xmath13 .",
    "these colours indicate the presence of a young stellar population .",
    "we further investigated the nature of the main  cloud and its oc by searching for the presence of h@xmath14 emission using narrow - band h@xmath14 imaging with the ntt .",
    "these images reveal the presence of h@xmath14 emission in the oc at the location of the peak of the , indicating that some star formation is occurring in the oc .",
    "most interestingly , two small regions of h@xmath14 emission were found at the edge of the main  cloud , at a distance of about 100 kpc from the oc ( indicated by 1 & 2 in fig .",
    "the broad - band images indicate that there is no extended optical continuum light near these two h@xmath14 regions .",
    "the h@xmath14 luminosities of the  complexes are @xmath15 erg s@xmath5 ( i.e.   30 - 50 times orion ) .",
    "the rate of star formation estimated from these luminosities is very modest : around 0.005 myr-1 per region .",
    "all the stars corresponding to the diffuse optical counterpart can be formed over a hubble time with such a star formation rate .",
    "optical spectroscopy of the three h@xmath14 regions was performed with fors1 on the vlt .",
    "preliminary analysis of the data suggests that the abundances in the h@xmath14 regions are only slightly below solar ( in the range 0.5 - 1.0 @xmath16 ) .",
    "this relatively high abundance excludes a primordial nature of the  clouds .",
    "the observations point to a tidal- or merger - related origin for the system of  clouds near ngc 1490 . the alternative hypothesis , i.e.   the  clouds are primordial , can be excluded because of the near solar abundance measured in the  complexes .",
    "the arc - like arrangement of the  clouds is suggestive for a tidal origin .",
    "it bears some resemblance to other systems .",
    "there is probably a parallel between the objects discussed here and systems like e.g.  the leo ring ( schneider et al .",
    "tidal interactions between galaxies and merging is a very diverse process that can produce very spectacular objects with bright tidal tails .",
    "but there are also cases where the evidence of an interaction is only detectable in neutral hydrogen .",
    "the extreme version is that of a galaxy being completely destroyed by a larger galaxy without any merging taking place .",
    "the material of the original galaxy is spread out over such a large volume that , in the optical , the surface brightness is well below the detection limit and only the  remains observable ( e.g.  ryan - weber et al .",
    "2003 , see also this proceedings ) .",
    "perhaps the  clouds near ngc  1490 have such an origin .",
    "an alternative hypothesis is that the  clouds are remnants of the merger between two or more gas - rich galaxies that also created the field elliptical ngc  1490 .",
    "the environment of ngc  1490 can be characterised as a loose group .",
    "the presence of an elliptical galaxy in such a group often indicates that merging has occurred in the group .",
    "the interesting aspects of the case presented here are : + 1 ) the very large amount of  involved , distributed in fairly large clouds for which only deep optical imaging reveals an optical counterpart . as the velocity structure indicates , these clouds are separate entities , suggesting they are tidal dwarfs even though they have no bright optical counterpart .",
    "the clouds are not , or hardly , visible in the optical , but , given the large reservoir of , perhaps at some point in time they will start to make stars and become brighter optical objects .",
    "+ 2 ) the existence of an extremely gas - rich object with @xmath17 .",
    "this is perhaps an example of a `` tidal gas cloud '' that started making stars recently .",
    "however , it is perhaps more likely that the optical material originates in a galaxy that was destroyed in an interaction .",
    "+ 3 ) the presence of small  complexes that are located far away from any optically detectable galaxy , in our case more than 100 kpc . only very few examples of such  regions are known .",
    "the observations presented here suggest that in more systems intergalactic  complexes may exist .",
    "as a final remark , we note that , although the results discussed above fit very well into the picture continued accretion by early - type galaxies , and the associated external origin of  in early - type galaxies , we have found some indications that some early - type galaxies do not fit into this scheme . our survey has revealed a surprisingly large number of early - type galaxies that have very large ( up to 200 kpc in size ) , regular disks of low column density . in fig .",
    "4 we present three examples of such large regularly rotating  disks . the largest of these disks have  masses up to 10@xmath0 m@xmath1 . given their size and regular appearance",
    ", these disks must be quite old , in many cases well over @xmath18 yr .",
    "hence , they are not related to recent accretions and may be related to a much earlier formation phase of these galaxies .",
    "moreover , no large accretion can have occurred by these galaxies , as these would likely have destroyed these large  disks , or have triggered significant star formation in the  disk . the  column density in these disks peaks at only 10@xmath19 atoms cm@xmath8 , so , despite the large  reservoir , no significant star formation is occurring .",
    "these  disks will evolve only very slowly and will remain as purely gaseous disks for very long periods of time , provided the environment is not too hostile for these disks ."
