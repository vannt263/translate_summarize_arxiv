    "most finite element methods are constructed on triangular and quadrilateral meshes , or on tetrahedral , hexahedral , prismatic , and pyramidal meshes . to extend",
    "the idea of the finite element method into meshes employing general polygonal and polyhedral elements , one immediately faces the problem of choosing suitable discrete spaces on general polygons and polyhedrons .",
    "this issue has rarely been addressed in the past , partly because it can usually be circumvented by dividing the polygon or polyhedron into sub - elements using only one or two basic shapes . however , allowing the use of general polygonal and polyhedral elements does provide more flexibility , especially for complex geometries or problems with certain physical constraints .",
    "one of such example is the modeling of composite microstructures in material sciences .",
    "a well - known solution to this problem is the voronoi cell finite element method @xcite , in which the mesh is composed of polygons or polyhedrons representing the grained microstructure of the given material .",
    "the main difficulty of constructing conforming finite element methods on voronoi meshes is that , the finite element space has to be carefully chosen so that it is continuous along interfaces . although the constructions on triangles , quadrilaterals , or three - dimensional simplexes are straight forward , it is not easy for general polygons and polyhedrons",
    ". probably the only practically used solution is the rational polynomial interpolants proposed by wachspress @xcite , in which rational basis functions are defined using distances from several `` nodes '' .",
    "an important constraint in the construction of the wachspress basis is that , the rational basis functions need to be piecewise linear along the boundary of every element , in order to ensure @xmath0 conformity of the finite element space .",
    "this not only limits the approximation order of the entire wachspress finite element space , but also complicates the construction .",
    "the wachspress element has gained a renewed interest recently @xcite . however , as we have pointed out above , its construction is complicated and usually requires the aid of computational algebraic systems such as maple .    another practically important issue is to define finite element methods on hybrid meshes .",
    "hybrid meshes are frequently used nowadays .",
    "it can handle complicated geometries , and can sometimes reduce the total number of unknowns .",
    "another possible reason for using the hybrid mesh is that , some engineers argue that in three - dimensions , a hexahedral mesh yields more accurate solution than a tetrahedral mesh for the same geometry @xcite , as partly verified by numerical experiments .",
    "however , pure hexahedral meshes lack the ability of handling complicated geometries .",
    "hence a hybrid mesh becomes a welcomed compromise between accuracy and flexibility . for conforming finite element methods based on hybrid meshes , continuity requirements on interfaces",
    "must be satisfied .",
    "such a coupling is straight - forward for the @xmath0-conforming finite elements on a triangular - quadrilateral hybrid mesh .",
    "however , for three - dimensional meshes , high order finite elements , or other complicated finite element spaces , it usually requires special treatments .",
    "an alternative solution , that can address both issues mentioned above , is to use the weak galerkin method proposed in @xcite .",
    "the weak galerkin method uses discontinuous piecewise polynomials inside each element and on the interfaces to approximate the variational solution . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors have proved optimal convergence of the weak galerkin method for the mixed formulation of second order elliptic equations on very general polygonal and polyhedral meshes .",
    "most of the existing error analysis of finite element methods assume triangular , quadrilateral , or some commonly - seen three - dimensional meshes . to our knowledge , it is the first time that optimal convergence for the finite element solutions has been rigorously proved in @xcite for general meshes of arbitrary polygons and polyhedrons .",
    "the discontinuous galerkin method imposes the interface continuity weakly , and is known to be able to handle non - conformal , hybrid meshes as well as a variety of basis functions .",
    "there have been many research works in this direction , for example , nodal discontinuous galerkin methods @xcite for hyperbolic conservation laws . however , we would like to point out that so far there has been no theoretical analysis on the convergence rate of discontinuous galerkin method , on very general polygonal or polyhedral meshes yet . motivated by the work in @xcite , here we would like to fill the gap .",
    "the objective of this paper is to establish the theoretical analysis of the interior penalty discontinuous galerkin method @xcite for elliptic equations on very general meshes and discrete spaces .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly describe the interior penalty discontinuous galerkin method in an abstract setting . in section 3 ,",
    "several assumptions on the discrete spaces are listed , which form a minimum requirement for the well - posedness and the approximation property of the discrete formulation .",
    "abstract error estimations are given . in section 4",
    ", we discuss choices of meshes and discrete spaces that satisfy the assumptions given in section 3 .",
    "finally , numerical results are presented in section 5 .",
    "consider the model problem @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a closed domain with lipschitz continuous boundary , and @xmath3 .    for any subdomain @xmath4 with lipschitz continuous boundary ,",
    "we use the standard definition of sobolev spaces @xmath5 with @xmath6 ( e.g. , see @xcite for details ) . the associated inner product , norm , and seminorms in @xmath5",
    "are denoted by @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "when @xmath10 , @xmath11 coincides with the space of square integrable functions @xmath12 . in this case",
    ", the subscript @xmath13 is suppressed from the notation of norm , semi - norm , and inner products .",
    "furthermore , the subscript @xmath14 is also suppressed when @xmath15 . finally ,",
    "all above notations can easily be extended to any @xmath16 . for the @xmath17 inner product on @xmath18 ,",
    "we usually denote it as @xmath19 in stead of @xmath20 , as it can be replaced by the duality pair when needed .    for simplicity",
    ", we assume that @xmath21 satisfy certain conditions such that equation ( [ eq : ellipticeq ] ) has at least @xmath22 regularity with @xmath23 , that is , the solution to equation ( [ eq : ellipticeq ] ) satisfies @xmath24 and @xmath25 this assumption is standard in the practice of interior penalty discontinuous galerkin methods , as it ensures that the exact solution @xmath26 also satisfies the discontinuous galerkin formulation , and thus the a priori error estimation can be easily derived in a lax - milgram framework .",
    "however , such a regularity assumption is not necessary in the practice of interior penalty methods .",
    "a well - known technique , which was first proposed by gudi @xcite , is to use a posteriori error estimation to derive an a priori error estimation for the interior penalty method , with only minimum regularity requirement @xmath27 .",
    "we believe that the same technique applies for the general polygonal and polyhedral meshes , as long as a working a posteriori error estimation is available .",
    "however , here we choose to completely skip this issue , as it is not the main purpose of this paper .",
    "assume that for all set @xmath14 discussed in this paper , including @xmath21 itself , the unit outward normal vector @xmath28 is defined almost everywhere on @xmath29 .",
    "note this is true for all polygonal and polyhedral elements with lipschitz continuous boundaries . since the exact solution @xmath24 with @xmath23 , it is clear that for any smooth function @xmath30 defined on @xmath14 , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the @xmath17-inner product in @xmath12 and @xmath33 is the @xmath17-inner product in @xmath34    let @xmath35 be a partition of the domain @xmath21 into non - overlapping subdomains / elements , each with lipschitz continuous boundary . here",
    "@xmath36 denotes the characteristic size of the partition , which will be defined in details later .",
    "the interior interfaces are denoted by @xmath37 , where @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "boundary segments are similarly denoted by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 .",
    "denote by @xmath42 the set of all interior interfaces and boundary segments in @xmath35 , and by @xmath43 the set of all interior interfaces .",
    "for every @xmath44 , let @xmath45 be the area / volume of @xmath14 , and for every @xmath46 , let @xmath47 be its length / area .",
    "denote @xmath48 the diameter of @xmath46 and @xmath49 the diameter of @xmath41 .",
    "clearly , when @xmath16 , we have @xmath50 . finally , define @xmath51 to be the characteristic mesh size .",
    "notice that @xmath35 defined above is a very general mesh / partition on @xmath21 , as we do not specify the shape and conformal property of @xmath41 .",
    "the interior penalty discontinuous galerkin ( ipdg ) method can be extended to such a general mesh , without any modification of the formulation .",
    "however , to ensure its approximation rate , certain conditions must be imposed on @xmath35 and the discrete function spaces . in this paper , we are interested in discussing the minimum requirements of such conditions .",
