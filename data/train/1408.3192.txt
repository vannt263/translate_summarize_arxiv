    "inflation is a successful paradigm to solve the main problems of the standard cosmological models such as the flatness , horizon and relics problems .",
    "the simplest inflationary model is described by a scalar field which slowly rolls down its potential  @xcite .",
    "one of the scalar fields which can be responsible for the early time inflation in the history of the universe , is the tachyon field  @xcite described by the dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) action .",
    "there are a wide range of potentials corresponding to this field .",
    "so , we confront with several numbers of inflationary models , which their viability should be specified .",
    "if a model is consistent with observational data , it can be considered as a viable inflationary model .",
    "the recently released observational data , from background imaging of cosmic extragalactic polarization ( bicep2 )  @xcite , imposes new constraints on the model s parameters . in this regard ,",
    "some models are confirmed by observation and some others are ruled out .",
    "two important parameters in an inflationary models are tensor - to - scalar ratio and the scalar spectral index , which describe the properties of the cosmological perturbations .",
    "the limit on the tensor - to - scalar ratio from the combined wmap9+ecmb+bao+h@xmath0 data  @xcite , is @xmath1 .",
    "also , this combined dataset gives the value of the scalar spectral index as @xmath2 .",
    "the joint planck+wmap9+bao data  @xcite imposes the constraint @xmath3 on the tensor to scalar ratio and gives @xmath4 .",
    "now , the planck+wmap+bicep2+bao dataset  @xcite , gives new values of these parameters as @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the large values of @xmath7 , reported by bicep2 , shows the large amplitude of gravitational wave modes generated during inflation .",
    "another cosmological perturbation parameter which has attracted much interest is the spectral index of the gravitational wave ( the tensor spectral index ) .",
    "the planck+wmap+bicep2+bao dataset gives @xmath8 .",
    "so , this dataset shows the blue tilt of the tensor spectral index which means that the stress - energy tensor violates the null energy condition , meaning that @xmath9 , so this is a challengeable result of bicep2 data .",
    "also , this result does nt satisfy the consistency relation @xmath10 , predicted by the standard inflationary model .",
    "but , it is demonstrated in  @xcite that the spectrum of the primordial gravitational waves have significant effect on the cmb tt spectrum at very large scales .",
    "actually , a large change in the positive @xmath11 only induces very small change at small angular power . since at large scales b - mode power is absent , we can not constrain @xmath11 tightly with the current observational data .",
    "so , it seems that to obtain a reliable value for the tensor spectral index , it should be checked with future experiments .",
    "here we investigate the status of the tachyon field inflation in the light of recent observational data . by exploring the tensor - to - scalar ratio , scalar spectral index , its running and tensor spectral index , in the background of planck+wmap+bicep2+bao data",
    ", we find that a minimally coupled tachyon field inflation has severe tension with observation and is disproved by recent data .",
    "however , a nonminimally coupled tachyon field with some appropriate potentials is consistent with recent observational data .",
    "the action of a simple inflationary model with a tachyon field , associated with unstable d - branes , can be written as follows @xmath12d^{4}x\\ , ,   \\label{1}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the tachyon field , @xmath14 is its potential and @xmath15 is the 4-dimensional ricci scalar . in a frw background , the action ( 1 ) leads to the following friedmann equation @xmath16 by variation of the action ( 1 ) with respect to the tachyon field we obtaion the equation of motion of the tachyon field as follows @xmath17 where a prime marks a derivative with respect to the tachyon field and a dot refers to derivative with respect to the cosmic time .",
    "the energy conservation equation of the model with minimally coupled tachyon field is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20    for a tachyonic inflationary model the slow roll parameters , which are defined as @xmath21 and @xmath22 , take the following form  @xcite @xmath23 and @xmath24 also , the number of e - folds is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the value of @xmath13 at the horizon crossing of the scales and @xmath27 is the value of @xmath13 at the end of inflation .    to test the viability of an inflationary model , studying",
    "the spectrum of the perturbations which are produced due to quantum fluctuations of the fields is useful . with a perturbed frw metric in a longitudinal gauge as  @xcite @xmath28 the scalar spectral index ,",
    "the tensor - to - scalar ratio and the running of the scalar spectral index corresponding to a minimally coupled tachyon model , within the slow - roll approximation ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) , are given as @xmath31 @xmath32 and @xmath33    the tensor spectral index in a minimally coupled tachyon model is given by the following expression @xmath34    now , we are going to test this simple model in confrontation with observational data .",
    "to this end , we choose several potentials and solve the integral of equation ( 9 ) .",
    "then we find the value of the scalar field at the horizon crossing and substitute it in equations ( 11)-(14 ) .",
    "finally we plot the behavior of @xmath7 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath11 in the background of planck+wmap+bicep2+bao data .",
    "the results are shown in figure 1 .    in panel _ * a * _ of figure 1 , we have shown the behavior of the tensor - to - scalar ratio versus the scalar spectral index in a model with a minimally coupled tachyon filed and with several potentials . as the figure shows , a tachyon field model with potentials such as a linear potential @xmath37  @xcite , a quadratic potential @xmath38 , a potential as @xmath39 , a quartic potential @xmath40 , a potential motivated by axion monodromy , as @xmath41  @xcite and an exponential potential @xmath42 is totally outside the planck+wmap+bicep2+bao data .",
    "we note that a minimally coupled tachyon field inflation with potentials @xmath43 and @xmath44 was supported by the planck2013 data  @xcite .",
    "now we see that a minimal tachyon model is ruled out by the planck+wmap+bicep2+bao joint data . in panel _ * b * _ of figure 1 we have depicted the tensor spectral index versus the scalar spectral index .",
    "a minimally coupled tachyon field model predicts a red tilt tensor spectral index , but the value of the tensor spectral index is small .",
    "the evolution of the running of the scalar spectral index versus the scalar spectral index is shown in panel _ * c * _ of figure 1 .",
    "once again , we see that a minimally coupled tachyon field inflation with mentioned potentials is not supported by this joint dataset . it should be noticed that , with an exponential potential the running of the scalar spectral index is far from the observational data and is not shown in the figure . a minimally coupled tachyon model with an intermediate potential ( @xmath45 with @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is defined by @xmath48 , @xmath49 )",

    "the results are shown in the following figures . in figure 2",

    "we see the behavior of the running of the scalar spectral index versus the scalar spectral index with the same potentials and in the background of the mentioned dataset .",
    "our numerical analysis shows that a nonminimally coupled tachyon field inflation is observationally viable for some sorts of potential and in some specific ranges of the nonminimal coupling parameter .    with a linear potential ,",

    "another potential which we consider here , is an intermediate potential .",

    "a minimally coupled tachyon field inflation is not supported by the joint data of planck+wmap+bicep2+bao since these models predict small values of the tensor - to - scalar ratio in comparison with the recent data .",
