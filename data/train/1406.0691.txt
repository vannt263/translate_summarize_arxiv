    "there has been an increasing interest to study cities and urban lives mainly due to our increasing ability to collect data which gives us better clues how cities are functioning .",
    "some empirical regularities have been established about cities .",
    "most urban properties , such as , land area , socio - economic rate , etc , vary continuously with population size and are well described mathematically as power - law scaling relations@xcite .",
    "the size distribution of cities also fits a power function ( known as zipf s law ) : the number of cities with populations greater than @xmath1 is proportional to @xmath2@xcite .",
    "geometrically , the complex spatial structure of cities have apparent fractal nature associated with individual cities and entire urban systems@xcite .",
    "most traditional research of city geography focus on cities or city clusters",
    ". providers of electronic maps such as google and baidu give us access to spatial structure data at the sub - scales of cities .",
    "these data records spatial coordinate information of numerous urban facilities .",
    "china has been experiencing the largest urbanization process in human history .",
    "about 300 million people move to cities in the last 2 decades@xcite . as a response",
    ", many urban facilities have been developed to satisfy their needs .",
    "it is of special interest how these facilities are spatially organized during their rapid development .    in this paper",
    ", we present evidence that spatial distribution of urban facilities , much alike that of city clusters , are statistically self - similar at all scales .",
    "two measurements are employed to confirm these findings .",
    "the first measurement is the second - order statistics @xmath0 function by number counting@xcite .",
    "derivative of @xmath0 function gives the pair correlation and covariance functions .",
    "if the deviation of @xmath0 from its complete spatial randomness(csr ) version @xmath3 is a power function @xmath4 , it means that the pair correlation is also a power function .",
    "the second measurement is the method of expanding bins .",
    "the variance @xmath5 and average number @xmath6 of events in a series of expanding bins are related by a power function @xmath7 , which also implies a self - similar scaling property of urban facilities@xcite .",
    "the two methods are closely related to each other .",
    "the exponents @xmath8 and @xmath9 are found to satisfy @xmath10 in our empirical results .",
    "however , they are not completely redundant",
    ". some model , e.g. , the correlated percolation model ( cpm ) does not produce the desired variance - mean relationship even though the fitted spatial covariance function is imposed to its random field .",
    "one goal of this paper is to understand whether the power law of variance - mean and power law autocorrelation function indicate a universal scaling rule about urban facilities . by doing so",
    ", we apply the two methods to a lot of spatial data of urban facilities , which includes 8 facilities in 37 major chinese cities .",
    "the power laws seem to hold for all combinations of facilities and cities , so does the relationship of the exponents @xmath11 .",
    "then as the other goal of this paper , we propose a mathematical model of double stochastic process ( dsp ) in which the two empirical findings can both be embedded .",
    "the dsp model resembles the actual process of urban facilities in the sense that urban facilities are developing on top of the existing structure of a city while the city structure itself can also be modelled as a stochastic process .",
    "one possible explanation of the scaling `` universality '' of urban facilities is that they come from the same source of the scaling invariance of the environment of the city , which could result from the fractal nature of geographic characteristics of the city@xcite or the fractal residential settlement@xcite .",
    "however this picture does not rule out the possibility that the scaling property of urban facilities is from some type of critical process arising from interactions between the facilities and city environment and among the facilities themselves .",
    "the double stochastic process is a mathematical framework which models the macro statistical properties of urban facilities and ignores the underlying interactions .",
    "there are two ways to generate point patterns with scaling invariance .",
    "one way is to have a lattice model in which the point patterns are formed according to some rules on a lattice .",
    "diffusion limited aggregation ( dla ) is such a model in which particles are added on at a time and move randomly until they join the cluster@xcite .",
    "the model produces the desirable fractional power - law behaviour of the correlation function .",
    "one concern when applying dla model to urban systems is that the treelike dendritic structures generated from dla model does not resemble the actual spatial morphology@xcite .",
    "also urban systems do not have obvious central places as seen in dla model .",
    "another method is to assume that underlying the discrete point pattern there is a continuous random field .",
    "the spatial correlation properties of the point patterns can be imposed to the random field .",
    "correlated percolation model(cpm ) puts the idea into practice to model city growth@xcite , which takes the development process of a city cluster as correlated rather than being added to the cluster at random . with slight different notations as in the paper ,",
    "we summarize cpm as follows .",
    "the model generates a gaussian random process @xmath12 with a long range power correlation function . by choosing a spatial varying occupancy probability @xmath13 ,",
    "the model can control the spatial concentration of population density . for a realization of random field @xmath12 ,",
    "the discretized occupancy sequence is determined by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the cumulative distribution function of the gaussian random variable @xmath12 and @xmath16 is the heaviside step function .",
    "the model is very successful in modelling both dynamics of city development and static statistical properties of the perimeter of the city cluster and power law distributions of urban settlements .",
    "it is appealing to apply cpm to urban facilities as the subscale analogy to city clusters .",
    "however , as shown in appendix , cpm does not produce @xmath11 if the covariance structure of @xmath0 function is imposed to the random field @xmath17 .",
    "the scaling property of variance - mean relationship @xmath11 rely on the covariance of @xmath18 after a threahold @xmath19 is set to generate point patterns .",
    "on the other hand , the two empirical scaling properties can be easily embedded in dsp model .",
    "besides , cpm does not generate the same results when we generate the discrete point patterns and change the scale of discretization .",
    "the heaviside function @xmath16 is either 0 or 1 .",
    "for example , when threshold @xmath19 is chosen , if both @xmath20 and @xmath21 , then @xmath22 . if a larger discretization scale is taken to combine @xmath23 and @xmath24 to one vertex , @xmath25 , then @xmath26 .",
    "thanks to the additivity of poisson distribution , dsp gives the same results when applied to different scales of discretization . in this case , @xmath27 , @xmath28=\\text{e}[n(i)]+\\text{e}[n(i+1)]$ ] . the additivity is preserved .    in this paper , dsp and cpm",
    "are both implemented for comparison .",
    "dsp fits the variance and mean power relationship closer to empirical results than cpm .",
    "in the continuous limit of a point pattern , we can define a random field @xmath29 . as the tradition , an upper case letter is used to denote a random variable , and lower case one to denote a sample . in spatial point analysis@xcite ,",
    "the first and second order properties of point pattern are described by its intensity function @xmath30}{|d\\vec{x}| } } = \\text{e}[\\lambda(\\vec{x } ) ] = \\lambda(\\vec{x})$ ] , and second - order intensity function @xmath31}{|d\\vec{x}||d\\vec{y}| } = \\text{e}[\\lambda(\\vec{x})\\lambda(\\vec{y } ) ] $ ] .",

    ", @xmath36 is a constant , covariance density function only depends on distance @xmath37 between two spatial locations .",

    "if the deviation of @xmath42 from csr version is a power function , e.g. , @xmath43 , then , @xmath44      another way to analyze scaling properties of point pattern is the method of expanding bins . a set of equal - sized non - overlapping bins are introduced to divide the urban area of a city into @xmath45 equal - sized segments , the size of each bin is @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the area of the whole city",

    "if the point pattern is generated from stochastic model , e.g. , from a underlying poisson process with spatial non - homogeneous density @xmath55 , the power law relationship of variance and average number of events implies that the poisson density is a spatially correlated with a power covariance density @xmath56 , and the two exponents are related by @xmath57 as will be shown in appendix . since",

    ", we record urban data of subscale structures which includes the spatial coordinates of 8 urban facilities in the city area and adjacent counties and county - level cities of 37 major chinese cities .",
    "the 8 facilities are : beauty salons , banks , stadiums , schools , pharmacy , convenient stores , restaurants and tea houses .",
    "the 37 major cities consist of 4 direct - controlled municipalities ( beijing , shanghai , chongqing and tianjin ) , 30 provincial capitals and sub - provincial cities and 3 other large cities .",
    "the spatial data is the latitude and longitude coordinates of each facility .",
    "the spatial data of the latitude and longitude spherical coordinates is converted to the plane coordinate data denoted by meters ( data is all rounded to meter ) .",
    "since it is hard to define the exact boundary of a city , we fix a central point of the city , and only consider those events fallen into a @xmath59 square lattice centered around the central point .",
    "the bins size is chosen from @xmath60 meters to @xmath61 meters at interval of @xmath62 meters in the method of expanding bins .",
    "when calculating the @xmath42 function , @xmath37 is chosen from @xmath60 meters to @xmath61 meters at increasing interval so that in log - log plot the distance somehow spreads uniformly .",
    "as an example to show the scaling properties , we choose 3 facilities ( banks , convenient stores and restaurants ) in beijing and guangzhou , the largest city in the northern and southern china .",
    "there are 6 combinations out of 3 facilities and 2 cities . as shown in fig .",

    "2 . in order to plot the results together ,",
    "8 cities are excluded for which there is not enough sample data to estimate variance - mean for at least one facility .",
    "we tend to believe that these exponents are universal in the sense that : ( a ) they do not have any systematic variations across 8 urban facilities regardless of their different nature of business or different concentrations in each city , ( b ) they do not show significant dependence on city regardless of the dramatic difference in population size , geographical characteristics , tradition of city planing from big cities such as beijing to small cities such as yinchuan .",
    "the error bars only indicate the statistical errors from linear regression .",
    "the variations of the exponents from the average value of all cities in fig .",
    "2 may be explained by other sources of errors .",
    "for example , the fixed choice of @xmath65 area for each city may violate the stationery assumption as in some region of a city , e.g. a harbour city , there are not facilities at all .",
    "the other purpose of this paper is to propose a mathematical model in which the two power law rules , i.e. , the power law of the spatial covariance and that of variance - mean relationship , can be embedded .",
    "it should be noted that only the first and second statistics are reflected in the power law rules .",
    "more information is needed , e.g. , higher order statistics , in order to construct more realistic models .",
    "cpm has been successfully applied to model the growth of city clusters .",
    "it is reasonable to visualize city development as addition of new units to the perimeter of an existing system .",
    "urban facilities , on the other hand , is developing on top of an existing city structure . besides the stochastic nature of the urban growth ,",
    "another stochastic process is needed to model the randomness of the locating of urban facilities .",
    "another reason we propose dsp is that it can predit the relationship of the exponents of two power law functions @xmath11 .",
    "the first layer stochastic process of dsp is a random field of density function @xmath55 , which models the inhomogeneous concentration of facilities in a city .",
    "the density function is a correlated random field to reflect the spatial heterogeneity of the city .",
    "similar to correlated percolation model , the density function is long - range correlated , which takes account of the fractal structure of the city .",
