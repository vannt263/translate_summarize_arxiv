    "over the last three decades , the low - dimensional quantum spin models with competing ( frustrated ) interactions have attracted considerable research interest especially due to their extraordinary diverse ground - state behaviour .",
    "_ geometrically frustrated spin systems _ constitute a special sub - class of the frustrated models that can be distinguished by incapability of spins , inherent in their lattice positions , to simultaneously minimize the ground - state energy of each individual spin - spin interaction @xcite . as a rule , the quantum spin systems affected by a rather strong geometric frustration often exhibit an exotic non - magnetic ground state ( which does not have its classical analogue ) in addition to a rich variety of the semi - classically ordered ones @xcite .",
    "it is worthy to notice , moreover , that a subtle interplay between the geometric frustration and quantum fluctuations gives rise to a number of intriguing phenomena including the macroscopic degeneracy of ground state @xcite , order by disorder effect @xcite , chirality @xcite , quantum phase transitions @xcite-@xcite , quantized plateaux in the magnetization curves @xcite-@xcite , double - peak specific heat curves @xcite-@xcite , enhanced magnetocaloric effect @xcite-@xcite , etc .    despite a significant amount of effort",
    ", there are only few frustrated spin-@xmath0 quantum heisenberg models , such as majumdar - ghosh model on double chain @xcite-@xcite , sawtooth ( @xmath2 ) chain @xcite-@xcite , or shastry - sutherland model @xcite , for which precise analytic solution is available leastwise for the ground state .",
    "nevertheless , it should be pointed out that frustrated quantum systems are in general rather difficult to deal with , since extensive numerical methods must be used in order to obtain a reliable estimate of their magnetic properties . from this point of view , the one - dimensional ( 1d ) frustrated spin systems are the simplest systems with respect to accurate treatment . of these systems , the spin-@xmath0 quantum heisenberg model with",

    "topology is currently actively engaged in the investigation of geometric frustration .",
    "interestingly , this simple quantum system turned out to have rather complex ground state ; apart from the usual ferrimagnetic phase there are in fact several quantum dimerized and plaquette states involved in the zero - field ground - state phase diagram @xcite-@xcite .",
    "further studies devoted to the spin-@xmath0 quantum heisenberg model on the diamond chain have provided fairly accurate results for the ground - state phase diagram in a presence of the external field @xcite-@xcite , the spin gap @xcite , the magnetization and susceptibility @xcite .",
    "another remarkable finding relates to the observation of an inversion phenomenon , which can be induced in the frustrated diamond chain through the exchange anisotropy @xcite .",
    "note that the ground state and thermodynamics of the mixed - spin diamond chains containing also higher - spin sites have already been particularly examined as well @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to remark that 1d frustrated spin systems have initially been introduced purely as toy models suitable for investigating the effect of spin frustration .",
    "however , a recent progress achieved in the design and controlled synthesis of molecular - based magnetic materials afforded another stimulus for testing 1d frustrated spin systems by overcoming the lack of desirable model compounds .",
    "as a matter of fact , the rapidly expanding field of molecular engineering have led to fabrication of several coordination polymers , which can be regarded as genuive examples of the frustrated spin models @xcite . with the help of structural data known long ago @xcite , kikuchi and",
    "co - workers @xcite-@xcite have recognized cu@xmath3(co@xmath3)@xmath4(oh)@xmath4 ( azurite ) as an appropriate candidate for the diamond chain compound .",
    "experimental data measured for the high - field magnetization , susceptibility , specific heat , nmr @xcite-@xcite and esr data @xcite-@xcite have indeed confirmed kikuchi s conjecture and it is now quite well established that the azurite represents the actual material for the frustrated diamond chain .",
    "it should be also mentioned that sufficiently strong frustration found in the azurite clearly manifests itself in its quantum features ; the high - field magnetization shows quantum plateau at one third of the saturation magnetization , the susceptibility turned out to have two round peaks at relatively low temperatures and esr data have proven the gap - less excitation spectrum .",
    "theoretical interest focused on the diamond chain structure also enhances its another experimental realizations provided by the polymeric compounds such as cu@xmath4oso@xmath5 @xcite and m@xmath3(oh)@xmath4 ( m = ni , co , mn ) @xcite-@xcite .    with this background",
    ", we shall investigate in the present article a simplified version of the frustrated ising - heisenberg diamond chain , which can exactly be solved by applying an accurate map based on the generalized decoration - iteration transformation @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that this relatively simple and straightforward analytical approach has recently been adapted to study an appearance of quantized plateaux in the magnetization process of the trimerized @xcite and tetramerized @xcite ising - heisenberg linear chains .",
    "as we shall show hereafter , the same strategy can also be used to explore the frustrated ising - heisenberg diamond chain , which represents another particular realization of models tractable within the generalized algebraic maps .",
    "the main goal of present work is to exploit a grand advance of the method used for obtaining exact results for all possible ground states as well as all basic thermodynamic quantities .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model hamiltonian and major features of the mapping method are presented in section 2 .",
    "section 3 is divided into two sub - sections . in the former one , we provide rigorous results for the spin-@xmath0 ising - heisenberg diamond chain , while the latter one comprises magnetic data of the mixed spin-@xmath0 and spin-1 ising - heisenberg diamond chain .",
    "altogether , exact results for ground - state phase diagrams , magnetization , entropy , susceptibility and specific heat are derived and particularly discussed for both investigated diamond chains .",
    "a cooling rate of adiabatic demagnetization is also explored in connection with the enhanced magnetocaloric effect .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks are drawn in section 4 .",
    "let us begin by considering two kinds of spins regularly distributed on the 1d lattice composed of the diamond - shaped units as diagrammatically depicted in fig .  1 .",
    "to ensure an exact tractability of this spin system , we shall further suppose that each diamond - shaped plaquette consists of two dumbbell _ heisenberg _ spins ( @xmath1 ) , which are placed in between two _ ising _ spins ( @xmath6 ) residing corner - sharing positions on the diamond motifs .",
    "for further convenience , we shall write the total hamiltonian as a sum over plaquette hamiltonians , i.e. @xmath7 , where each plaquette hamiltonian @xmath8 involves all interaction terms associated with one diamond - shaped unit ( see fig",

    "the parameter @xmath2 allows to control the heisenberg exchange interaction @xmath13 between the easy - axis ( @xmath15 ) and easy - plane ( @xmath16 ) regime and finally , the last two terms incorporate coupling of the ising and heisenberg spins to an external longitudinal magnetic field @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the crucial point of our calculation represents calculation of the partition function . by making use of the commutation rule between different plaquette hamiltonians , i.e. by exploiting @xmath19 = 0 $ ] valid for each @xmath20 ,",
    "the partition function of ising - heisenberg diamond chain can be partially factorized into the following product @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 is being boltzmann s constant , @xmath24 the absolute temperature , the symbol @xmath25 means a summation over all available configurations of ising spins @xmath26 and @xmath27 stands for a trace over spin degrees of freedom of two dumbbell heisenberg spins belonging to @xmath28th diamond unit . after performing this partial trace",

    "( [ eq : dit ] ) depends on the spin of heisenberg atoms and its explicit form is given in appendix for two particular spin cases @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "it is noteworthy that a general validity of the mapping relation ( [ eq : dit ] ) necessitates a self - consistency condition to be satisfied , what means , that it must hold independently of spin states of both ising spins @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "it can readily be proved that a substitution of four possible configurations of the ising spins @xmath35 and @xmath36 into the formula ( [ eq : dit ] ) indeed gives just three independent equations , which unambiguously determine the unknown mapping parameters @xmath37 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xmath38 here , we have defined the functions @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 in order to write the transformation parameters @xmath37 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 in more abbreviated and general form . now , a direct substitution of the transformation ( [ eq : dit ] ) into the expression ( [ eq : z ] ) yields the equality @xmath42 which establishes an exact mapping relationship between the partition function @xmath43 of the ising - heisenberg diamond chain and , respectively , the partition function @xmath44 of the uniform spin-@xmath0 ising linear chain defined by means of the nearest - neighbour coupling @xmath30 and the effective field @xmath31 .",
    "notice that the exact solution for the partition function of the latter system is well - known ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) and hence , the relation ( [ eq : zdz0 ] ) can readily be utilized for calculation of some important quantities ( magnetization , entropy , specific heat , susceptibility ) by making use of the standard thermodynamical - statistical relations .",
    "it should be mentioned , however , that there also exists another alternative approach that is of particular importance if some relevant physical quantity can not be obtained within this procedure .",
    "actually , the problem connected with the calculation of correlation functions and/or quadrupolar moment can be simply avoided by employing the following exact spin identities @xmath45 in above , the function @xmath46 depends exclusively on the ising spin variables @xmath26 , while the function @xmath47 may depend on any spin variable belonging to @xmath28th diamond plaquette .",
    "the superscripts @xmath48 label spatial components of the appropriate spin operators and finally , the symbols @xmath49 and @xmath50 stand for the standard canonical average performed over the ensemble defined on the ising - heisenberg diamond chain and its corresponding ising chain , respectively . by applying the exact spin identities ( [ eq : f1 ] ) and",

    "have been retrieved in the literature many times before @xcite , we shall restrict ourselves for brevity to listing the coefficients @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( @xmath63 = 13 ) emerging in the set of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : miz])-([eq : qhzz ] ) @xmath64 an explicit representation of the functions @xmath65 is too cumbersome to write it down here and it is therefore left for appendix .    finally , we just simply quote the well - known thermodynamical - statistical relations , which have been utilized for calculating gibbs free energy @xmath66 , entropy @xmath1 , specific heat @xmath67 and susceptibility @xmath68 .",
    "accurate results for these quantities have been obtained with the help of the precise mapping relation ( [ eq : zdz0 ] ) and using @xmath69 where @xmath70 is referred to as the gibbs free energy of corresponding spin-@xmath0 ising chain @xcite .",
    "before proceeding to a discussion of the most interesting results it is worthy to mention that the results derived in the preceding section hold regardless whether ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic interactions are assumed . as we are mainly interested in examination of the spin frustration effect , in what follows we restrict both exchange parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 to positive values in order to match the situation in the frustrated antiferromagnetic diamond chain .",
    "furthermore , it is convenient to reduce the number of free parameters by assuming equal @xmath71-factors for the ising and heisenberg spins , i.e. by imposing the same parameter representing the effect of external field @xmath72 . to simplify further discussion",
    ", we shall also introduce a set of reduced parameters @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 as describing dimensionless temperature , external field and the strength of frustration , respectively .",
    "first , let us take a closer look at the ground state of the spin-@xmath0 ising - heisenberg diamond chain . for illustration ,",
    "two ground - state phase diagrams are displayed in fig .",
    "2 , the one in the @xmath76 space for the system without external magnetic field ( fig . 2a ) and the other one in the @xmath77 space for the system placed in the non - zero external field under the assumption @xmath78 ( fig .",
    "both the figures clearly demonstrate that a competition between the interaction parameters @xmath79 , @xmath2 and @xmath80 gives rise to three possible ground states .",
    "apart from the usual ferrimagnetic phase ( fri ) and the frustrated phase ( fru ) found both in a presence as well as absence of the external field , the system ends up in the saturated paramagnetic phase ( spp ) once the external field is being above its saturation value .",
    "spin order within fri , fru and spp can be distinguished from one another according to their attributes ( physical quantities included in the set of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : miz])-([eq : qhzz ] ) ) , as well as , through their wave functions @xmath81",
    "@xmath82 @xmath83 the first product in the aforelisted eigenfunctions is carried out over all ising spins , the second one runs over all pairs of the heisenberg dumbbell spins and @xmath84 denotes standard ket vector assigned to @xmath85th projection of the ising ( @xmath86 ) and heisenberg ( @xmath87 ) spins .",
    "it is quite evident from the set of eqs .",
    "( [ fria ] ) that fri displays the classical ferrimagnetic spin arrangement usually observed in the pure ising systems , actually , all the results clearly indicate antiparallel alignment between the nearest - neighbouring ising and heisenberg spins . it should be emphasized , however , that the classical ferrimagnetic order originating from the antiferromagnetic ising interaction @xmath14 can be destroyed through the competing heisenberg interaction @xmath88 that brings a frustration into play . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the spin order dramatically changes when the frustration parameter @xmath79 exceeds the boundary value @xmath89 in such case , all heisenberg spin pairs create singlet dimers and on account of this singlet pairing , all ising spins become completely free to flip .",
    "in other words , the ising spins are thoroughly uncorrelated in fru on account of the frustration arising from the singlet pairing between the heisenberg spins as also suggested by ( [ frua ] ) .",
    "owing to this fact , it might be concluded that the diamond spin chain splits into a set of independent monomers ( ising spins ) and dimers ( heisenberg spin pairs ) whenever the frustration parameter is stronger than its boundary value @xmath90 .",
    "thus , fru is virtually being macroscopically degenerate monomer - dimer state with the residual entropy @xmath91 proportional to the total number of frustrated ising spins . for completeness",
    ", it should be also noticed that sufficiently strong external field stabilizes the standard spp regardless whether fri or fru constitutes the zero - field ground state ( see fig .",
    "as could be expected , all ising as well as heisenberg spins tend to align into the external - field direction above the saturation field , which represents lower bound for an occurrence of spp .",
    "next , we turn our attention to the magnetization process at zero as well as non - zero temperatures . for this purpose , two typical magnetization vs. field dependences",
    "are plotted in fig . 3 for several dimensionless temperatures .",
    "it can be readily understood by comparing the displayed magnetization curves with the phase diagram shown in fig . 2b that two different zero - temperature limits obviously reflect both possible types of field - induced transitions fri - spp ( fig .",
    "3a ) and fru - spp ( fig .",
    "since the ground state is being formed in the former ( latter ) case by fri ( fru ) , the zero - temperature magnetization curve depicted in fig .",
    "3b ) starts from non - zero ( zero ) magnetization in the limit of vanishing external field .",
    "contrary to this , both magnetization curves always start from zero magnetization ( disordered state ) at any finite temperature according to the one - dimensional character of the investigated spin system",
    ". it should be emphasized , moreover , that the magnetization jumps to be observed in the magnetization curves strictly at @xmath92 are gradually smeared out when temperature is raised from zero .",
    "in addition , the higher the temperature , the smaller the width of magnetization plateaux ( horizontal regions in the magnetization vs. field dependence ) , which entirely disappear from the magnetization curves above a certain temperature .",
    "finally , it is quite interesting to mention that the identified magnetization plateaux at one third of the saturation magnetization satisfy the oshikawa - yamanaka - affleck rule @xcite proposed for the formation of quantized plateaux .",
    "now , let us step forward to a discussion concerned with the thermal dependence of the zero - field susceptibility times temperature ( @xmath93 ) data as displayed in fig .",
    "4 . if the frustration parameter @xmath79 is selected so that fri constitutes the ground state ( fig .",
    "4a ) , then , @xmath93 data exhibit a round minimum prior to exponential divergence appearing on temperature decrease . as it can be clearly seen from fig .",
    "4a , the stronger the frustration parameter @xmath79 , the deeper the notable minimum whose position is simultaneously shifted towards lower temperatures .",
    "it should be mentioned , moreover , that an appearance of the round minimum in the @xmath94 dependence is a typical feature of quantum ferrimagnets , since @xmath93 product monotonously decreases with temperature for ferromagnets , while it monotonously increases for antiferromagnets @xcite .",
    "accordingly , a location of the round minimum can be regarded as a point that determines ferromagnetic - to - antiferromagnetic crossover in view of thermal exitations . on the other hand , if the frustration parameter @xmath79 drives the system into the disordered fru ground state ( fig .",
    "4b ) , the @xmath93 product then exhibits a round minimum before it tends to the constant value @xmath95 by approaching zero temperature .",
    "notice that this zero - temperature value can be explained in compliance with the curie law of the frustrated ising spins , which effectively form isolated spins ( monomers ) in fru .",
    "another quantity , which is important for overall understanding of thermodynamics , is being the specific heat .",
    "temperature variations of the zero - field specific heat are depicted in figs .",
    "5a - b for @xmath78 and several values of the frustration parameter @xmath79 .",
    "according to these plots , there still emerges at least one round maximum , which can be thought of as the usual schottky - type maximum irrespective whether fri or fru constitutes the ground state .",
    "if the frustration parameter is selected sufficiently close to fri - fru phase boundary given by @xmath90 , however , there also appears an additional second maximum located in the low - temperature part of the specific heat .",
    "apparently , the low - temperature peak becomes the more pronounced , the closer is @xmath79 selected to @xmath90 .",
    "when the frustration parameter @xmath79 drives the system into the disordered fru ground state , then , the striking second maximum gradually disappears upon further strenghtening of @xmath79 , since the low - temperature peak shifts towards higher temperatures until it entirely merges with the high - temperature schottky - type maximum ( see the curves labeled as @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) .",
    "these observations would suggest that the double - peak structure in the specific heat curves originates from thermal excitations between the ground - state spin configuration and the ones close enough in energy to the ground state .",
    "the situation becomes even more intriguing on applying the external magnetic field .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "5c , the rising external field generally causes a gradual increase in the height of the low - temperature peak and moves it towards the higher temperatures .",
    "similar trend is also seen in a change of the size and position of the high - temperature maximum , albeit this schottky - like peak moves towards higher temperature more slowly than the low - temperature one . as a result ,",
    "both maxima coalesce at a certain value of the external field and above this value , the specific heat exhibits just single rounded maximum ( see for instance the curve @xmath98 ) . apart from these rather trivial findings",
    ", a remarkable triple - peak specific heat curves can also be detected when small but non - zero external field is applied to the system driven by the frustration into the disordered fru state ( the case @xmath99 in fig .",
    "5c ) . besides two aforedescribed peaks ,",
    "whose origin has been resolved earlier , there also appears an additional third peak to be located at lowest temperature .",
    "there are strong indications that an appearance of this additional sharp maximum can be explained through the field - induced splitting of the energy levels related to the frustrated ising spins . in accordance with this statement , the insert of fig .",
    "5d clearly demonstrates how this peculiar third maximum gradually shifts towards higher temperatures with increasing the field strength until it coalesces with the second low - temperature peak ( see the curve labeled @xmath100 ) .    at last",
    ", we shall briefly discuss the adiabatic demagnetization curves studied in connection with the enhanced magnetocaloric effect .",
    "some interesting results for adiabatic processes keeping entropy constant are presented in fig . 6 in the form of the temperature vs. external field dependence .",
    "two depicted sets of demagnetization curves reflect two available adiabatic scenarios related to spp@xmath101fri ( fig .",
    "6a ) and spp@xmath101fru ( fig .",
    "6b ) transitions .",
    "apparently , the maximal cooling rate emerges in the vicinity of critical fields and zero field , where zero temperature is in principle reached whenever the entropy is set equal to or less than its residual value @xmath102 .",
    "it should be pointed out that a relatively fast heating , which occurs when the external field is lowered from its critical value , prevents a practical use of the whole demagnetization curves for a cooling purpose .",
    "in addition , the cooling effect becomes of technological relevance only if a cooling rate exceeds the one of paramagnetic salts . from this point of view",
    ", the enhanced magnetocaloric effect is observed only if the frustration drives the system into disordered fru ground state ( fig .",
    "6b ) . even under this condition , the cooling rate of paramagnetic materials",
    "is exceeded only if the entropy is chosen close enough to its residual value @xmath102 and the external field is below @xmath103 .",
    "this limitation would imply that temperatures in the sub - kelvin range are in principle accessible provided that the frustrated diamond chain compound with exchange constants of the order of few tents kelvin , such as azurite , is used as refrigerant .      in this part , we shall turn our attention to the mixed spin-@xmath0 and spin-@xmath34 ising - heisenberg diamond chain with the aim to clarify the impact of integer - valued heisenberg spins on the magnetic behaviour of the frustrated diamond chain .",
    "we start our discussion repeatedly with the ground - state analysis . the phase diagram constructed in an absence of the external field ( fig .",
    "7a ) implies existence of three possible ground states .",
    "besides the semi - classically ordered ferrimagnetic phase ( fri ) , there also appear the quantum ferrimagnetic phase ( qfi ) and the frustrated phase ( fru ) .",
    "fri , qfi and fru can be characterized by means of @xmath104 @xmath105 @xmath106_{3k-1 , \\ , 3k } , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "m_{\\rm i}^z = 0 , m_{\\rm h}^z = 0 , q_{\\rm hh}^{zz } = -c_{\\rm hh}^{zz } = ( 1 + \\delta^{-1})/2 ,   c_{\\rm hh}^{xx } = -2 \\delta \\delta^{-1 } , c_{\\rm ih}^{zz } = 0 ;   \\label{fru } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath107 , the first product in the aforelisted eigenfunctions is taken over all ising spins ( @xmath84 stands for @xmath86 ) and the second product runs over all pairs of the heisenberg dumbbell spins ( @xmath108 is assigned to @xmath109 ) .",
    "analytic expressions for the phase boundaries depicted in fig .",
    "6a read @xmath110 the most significant difference between the two investigated diamond chains apparently rests in a presence of qfi located in between fri and fru .",
    "this observation would suggest that the geometric frustration initially favours uprise of qfi before it finally energetically stabilizes fru .",
    "accordingly , it might be concluded that there may not occur in the mixed spin-@xmath0 and spin-1 diamond chain a direct frustration - induced transition between fri and fru except the one observable in the ising limit ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "next , the ground - state phase diagram reflecting the effect of external field is shown in fig .",
    "this phase diagram suggests that in response to the applied external field there also may arise the quantum ferromagnetic phase ( qfo ) and the saturated paramagnetic phase ( spp ) besides the aforementioned fri , qfi and fru phases @xmath112 @xmath113 before proceeding further , let us make few comments on all these possible ground states . since fri and spp",
    "are commonly observed also in the semi - classical ising spin systems , we should therefore concentrate on qfi , qfo and fru , in which quantum entanglement of the heisenberg spin pairs indicates the quantum nature of these phases .",
    "it can easily be understood from eqs .",
    "( [ qfi ] ) and ( [ qfo ] ) that qfi and qfo are quite similar one to each other . as a matter of fact ,",
    "all pairs of heisenberg spins reside in both phases the same eigenstate and thus , the only difference between them consists in the spin arrangement of their ising counterparts . in qfo , which is stable at stronger fields ,",
    "the ising spins tend to align towards the external field , whilst they are oriented in opposite to the external field in qfi , which is stable at relatively weaker fields .",
    "notice that the quantum entanglement between the pairs of heisenberg spins that occurs in qfi and qfo can also be understood within the valence - bond - solid picture @xcite .",
    "if spin-@xmath34 sites are decomposed into two spin-@xmath0 variables , then , one of the decomposed spins at each spin-@xmath34 site forms the singlet - dimer with its nearest - neighbouring spin-@xmath34 site , while the other one is polarized by the external field . as a result of this incomplete pairing",
    ", each spin-@xmath34 site effectively acts in qfi and qfo as it would be the spin-@xmath0 variable .",
    "further , it should be also remarked that all ising spins are completely free to flip ( frustrated ) in fru on behalf of a preferred antiferromagnetic alignment between each pair of the heisenberg spins .",
    "owing to this fact , fru can be viewed as a state characterized by a complete randomization of the ising spins , what consequently leads to a macroscopic degeneracy of fru resembled in its residual entropy @xmath91 .    to clarify the magnetization scenario available for the mixed spin-@xmath0 and spin-@xmath34 diamond chain , we depict in fig .",
    "8 all possible types of magnetization curves . in agreement with the phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "7b , there are in total four different types of magnetization curves reflecting the transitions fri - spp ( a ) , qfi - fri - spp ( b ) , fru - fri - spp ( c ) , and fru - qfo - spp ( d ) .",
    "it should be stressed , nevertheless , that the system undergoes true transitions between those phases merely at zero temperature , where indeed emerge stepwise magnetization curves with abrupt change(s ) of the magnetization at critical field(s ) .",
    "however , it is worthy to notice that there are no real magnetization jumps at any finite temperature and the sharp stepwise magnetization curves to be observed at zero temperature are gradually smeared out as temperature increases . it can be clearly seen from fig . 8",
    "that an increase in temperature actually shrinks also the width of plateaux until the plateau states completely disappear from the magnetization curves above a certain temperature .",
    "the most notable magnetization curves are those with the zero - field ground state corresponding to fru as shown in figs .",
    "8c - d . according to these plots",
    ", it can easily be realized that all frustrated ising spins tend to align to the external - field direction for any finite but non - zero external field provided that temperature is set to zero . at non - zero temperatures , on the contrary ,",
    "the magnetization rises much more steadily in the vicinity of zero field in comparison with the magnetization curves having the long - range - ordered fri ( fig . 8a ) and qfi ( fig .",
    "8b ) phases in the ground state .",
    "finally , it is also worthwhile to remark that the observed magnetization plateaux at @xmath114 ( qfi and fru ) and @xmath115 ( qfo ) of the saturation magnetization satisfy the oshikawa - yamanaka - affleck rule @xcite .",
    "now , let us investigate in particular an influence of the spin frustration on thermal variations of the zero - field susceptibility times temperature ( @xmath93 ) data .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath93 product is displayed in fig .",
    "9a for several values of the frustration parameter @xmath79 that determine the ground state to be either of fri or qfi type .",
    "interestingly , @xmath93 data then exhibit a round minimum upon cooling , which is followed by an exponentially steep increase that appears by approaching zero temperature .",
    "it is quite obvious from fig . 9a",
    "that the stronger the parameter of frustration @xmath79 , the deeper the notable minimum whose position is simultaneously shifted towards lower temperatures .",
    "it is worthy to remember , moreover , that the minimum in the @xmath116 plot is being a typical feature of quantum ferrimagnets @xcite and also in our case , the minimum becomes especially marked by selecting @xmath117 when qfi constitutes the ground state . on the other hand ,",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath93 data are depicted in fig .",
    "9b for the case when the frustration parameter @xmath118 drives the system into the disordered fru ground state . under these circumstances ,",
    "the susceptibility diverges as @xmath119 at low temperatures and @xmath93 product tends to constant value 1/12 nearby zero temperature .",
    "this value can be interpreted in terms of the curie law of the frustrated ising spins , since the spin arrangement that appears in fru can be viewed as being composed of an independent set of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg dimers and isolated ising monomers , whereas the former ones do not contribute to @xmath93 product in the zero - temperature limit .    to gain an insight into overall thermodynamics ,",
    "let us turn our attention to a thermal behaviour of the specific heat . for this purpose ,",
    "the zero - field specific heat is plotted against temperature in figs .",
    "10a - b for several values of the frustration parameter @xmath79 .",
    "it can be clearly seen from fig .",
    "10a that a rounded schottky - type maximum observable at smaller values of @xmath79 ( e.g. @xmath120 ) gradually changes , as the frustration strengthens , to a striking dependence with the shoulder superimposed on this round maximum ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that the shoulder becomes the more pronounced , the closer is @xmath79 selected to @xmath122 determining the phase boundary between fri and qfi . under further increase of the frustration",
    "the shoulder merges with the schottky - type maximum what eventually gives rise to a peculiar non - rounded maximum with almost constant value of the specific heat over the wide temperature range ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "next , fig .",
    "10b shows how the specific heat recovers its double - peak structure when @xmath79 approaches another phase boundary between qfi and fru to appear at @xmath124 ( see for instance the curves for @xmath125 and @xmath126 ) .",
    "in addition , it is quite evident from fig .",
    "10b that repeated strengthening of the frustration results in a suppression of the low - temperature peak until it finally merges with the high - temperature one .",
    "note furthermore that the high - temperature peak has in general tendency to enhance in magnitude ( both in height as well as in width ) as @xmath79 increases and its position is shifted towards higher temperatures .",
    "altogether , it might be concluded that the remarkable double - peak structure of the specific heat arises just when the frustration parameter is close enough to a phase boundary .",
    "this result is taken to mean that the observed double - peak specific heat curves always originate from thermal excitations to a spin configuration rather close in energy to the ground state .",
    "even more striking situation emerges by turning on the external field .",
    "the overall trends of the external field is to increase height and width of the low - temperature peak and to shift it towards higher temperatures until it coalesces with the higher - temperature maximum .",
    "it should be remarked , nevertheless , that the most notable dependences of the specific heat arise from when the frustration leads to the disordered fru ground state . besides the aforedescribed general trends illustrated in fig .",
    "10c , there also appears a remarkable kind of the specific heat curve with the triple - peak structure as particularly drawn in fig . 10d and its insert .",
    "apparently , the additional third peak observable at very low temperatures occurs on applying the small but non - zero external field .",
    "it is therefore quite reasonable to conjecture that an origin of this low - temperature peak lies in the field - induced splitting of energy levels related to the frustration of the ising spins . actually , the stronger the external field , the greater the splitting caused by the external field and consequently , the position of this peak steadily shifts towards higher temperatures . above certain external field ,",
    "the additional third peak vanishes because of merging with the low - temperature peak observable also in the zero - field case .",
    "finally , we shall close our discussion with an exploration of the adiabatic demagnetization examined in connection with the enhanced magnetocaloric effect .",
    "adiabatic processes keeping the entropy constant are plotted in fig .",
    "11 in the form of the temperature vs. external field dependence .",
    "two displayed sets of demagnetization curves evidently reflect adiabatic change of temperature , which accompanies the transitions spp@xmath127fri@xmath127qfi ( fig .",
    "11a ) and spp@xmath127qfo@xmath127fru ( fig .",
    "11b ) . when comparing these results with the ones formerly discussed for the spin-@xmath0 diamond chain ( fig .",
    "6 ) , one easily finds some similarities between the two investigated diamond chains . indeed ,",
    "the most obvious drop in temperature is retrieved once again in the vicinity of critical fields and zero field , where zero temperature is in principle reached whenever the entropy is set equal to or less than its residual value @xmath102 . moreover , the enhanced magnetocaloric effect with the cooling rate exceeding the one of paramagnetic salts occurs just as the disordered fru phase constitutes the ground state and the external field is below @xmath103 .",
    "by contrast , the most obvious difference between the two investigated spin systems consists in the greater diversity of the adiabatic process of the latter ( mixed - spin ) system , which exhibits dependences with two critical fields in addition to the ones with one critical field only .",
    "exactly solvable frustrated spin systems are currently much sought after in the field of condensed matter physics , since they can serve as useful model systems for in - depth understanding of the effect of geometric frustration still not fully elucidated , yet . in the present work ,",
    "we have provided rigorous results for one notable example of such system , the mixed spin-@xmath0 and spin-@xmath1 ising - heisenberg diamond chain tractable within the generalized decoration - iteration map .",
    "it is worthy to mention that this rather simple model system has primarily been developed to predict and to understand the behaviour of insulating magnetic materials , in which the heisenberg dimers interact with the ising monomers in such a way that they form the diamond chain .",
    "notice that the coordination polymers consisting of the pairs of interacting transition - metal elements ( heisenberg dimers ) coupled to the rare - earth elements ( ising monomers ) represent perspective experimental realizations of the proposed system .",
    "although we are not aware of any real coordination compound , which would meet this requirement , the recent progress in the design and controlled synthesis of the molecular - based magnetic materials supports our hope that it would be possible to prepare such polymeric chains in the near future .",
    "it is worthwhile to remark that a special emphasis is in our study laid on the investigation of geometric frustration generated by the competition between heisenberg- and ising - type interactions .",
    "our results clearly demonstrate that an interplay between the frustration and quantum fluctuations , both arising from the heisenberg exchange interaction , is being at the origin of interesting behaviour not commonly observed in the semi - classical ising spin systems .",
    "indeed , this interplay gives rise to several peculiar ground states with entangled states of heisenberg spins and quantum effects turned out to play a substantial role in determining their finite - temperature properties , as well . among other matters ,",
    "we have found rigorous evidence for appearance of the quantized plateux in the magnetization curves , the round minimum in temperature dependence of the susceptibility times temperature data , the double - peak zero - field specific heat curves , the enhanced magnetocaloric effect and so on . in our opinion ,",
    "the most interesting finding to emerge from our study is a direct evidence of the triple - peak specific heat curve that appears when applying small external field to the system driven by the frustration into the disordered state . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the discovery and possible explanation of the triple - peak structure in the specific heat curve has not been reported for any frustrated system hitherto .",
    "last but not least , it should be remarked that the relative ease of generalized mapping method used here implies a possibility of further extensions .",
    "actually , this approach can straightforwardly be extended to account also for the single - ion anisotropy effect , the biquadratic exchange interaction , the next - nearest - neighbour interaction , the multispin interactions , etc .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the applied procedure is not constrained neither by the lattice topology and thus , it can be utilized for investigating the effect of geometric frustration on the planar ising - heisenberg lattices composed of the diamond - shaped units @xcite . in this direction",
    "continuous our next work .",
