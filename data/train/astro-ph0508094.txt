    "magnetic reconnection is the physical process of breaking and rearrangement of magnetic field lines , which changes the topology of the field .",
    "it is one of the most fundamental processes of plasma physics and is believed to be at the core of many dynamic phenomena in laboratory experiments and in cosmic space .",
    "unfortunately , in spite of being so important , magnetic reconnection is still relatively poorly understood from the theoretical point of view .",
    "the reason is that plasmas usually have very high temperatures and low densities . in such plasmas ,",
    "the spitzer resistivity is extremely small and magnetic fields are almost perfectly frozen into cosmic plasmas . as a result , simple theoretical models , such as the sweet - parker reconnection model  @xcite predict that the magnetic reconnection processes should be extremely slow and insignificant throughout the universe . on the other hand ,",
    "astrophysical observations show magnetic reconnection tends to be fast and is likely to be the primary driver of many highly energetic cosmic processes , such as solar flares and geomagnetic storms .",
    "this contradiction between theoretical estimates and astrophysical observations triggered multiple attempts to build a theoretical model of fast magnetic reconnection .",
    "first , in 1964 petschek proposed a fast reconnection model  @xcite , in which fast reconnection is achieved by introducing switch - off magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) shocks attached to the ends of the reconnection layer in the downstream regions and by choosing the reconnection layer length to be equal to its minimal possible value under the condition of no significant disruption to the plasma flow .",
    "however , later numerical simulations and theoretical derivations did not confirm the petschek theoretical picture for the geometry of a reconnection layer  @xcite .",
    "second , numerical simulations studies of anomalous magnetic reconnection , for which resistivity is enhanced locally in the reconnection layer , were pioneered by ugai and tsuda  @xcite , by hayashi and sato  @xcite , and by scholer  @xcite .",
    "third , lazarian and vishniac proposed that fast reconnection can occur in turbulent plasmas  @xcite , although the back - reaction of magnetic fields can slow down reconnection in this case  @xcite . finally , recently there have been number of attempts to explain the fast magnetic reconnection by considering non - mhd effects  @xcite .",
    "most previous theoretical and numerical studies concentrated on reconnection processes in two - dimensions or in `` two - and - a - half - dimensions '' .",
    "the later is the term used for a problem in which physical scalars and all three components of physical vectors depend only on two spatial coordinates ( e.g.  @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) and are independent of the third coordinate ( @xmath2 ) .    in this paper",
    "we consider two - and - a - half - dimensional magnetic reconnection with anomalous resistivity in the classical sweet - parker - petschek reconnection layer , which is shown in the left plot in fig .",
    "[ fig_reconnection_layer ] .",
    "the reconnection layer is in the x - y plane with the y - axis being along the layer and the x - axis being perpendicular to the layer .",
    "the length of the layer is equal to @xmath3 .",
    "note that @xmath4 is approximately equal to or smaller than the global magnetic field scale , which we denote as @xmath5 .",
    "the thickness of the classical reconnection layer , @xmath6 , is much smaller than its length , i.e.  @xmath7 .",
    "the classical sweet - parker - petschek reconnection layer is assumed to possess a point symmetry with respect to its geometric center point o and reflection symmetries with respect to the axes @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( refer to fig .  [ fig_reconnection_layer ] ) .",
    "thus , for example , the x- and y - components of the plasma velocities @xmath8 and of the magnetic field @xmath9 have the following simple symmetries : @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "there might be a pair of petschek shocks attached to each of the two reconnection layer ends in the downstream regions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_reconnection_layer ] ) .",
    "because of the mhd jump conditions on the petschek shocks , the presence of these shocks requires the presence of a significant perpendicular magnetic field @xmath14 at the reconnection layer ends  @xcite .",
    "the plasma outflow velocity from the reconnection layer is approximately equal to the alfven velocity @xmath15 ( if the plasma viscosity is not very large ) . the plasma inflow velocity @xmath16 outside of the reconnection layer , at point m in fig",
    ".  [ fig_reconnection_layer ] , is much smaller than the outflow velocity , @xmath17 .",
    "finally , the magnetic field outside the reconnection layer is mostly in the direction of the layer ( i.e.  in the y - axis direction ) .",
    "the problem of quasi - stationary anomalous magnetic reconnection in the classical sweet - parker - petschek reconnection layer was recently theoretically addressed by kulsrud  @xcite for the special case of zero guide field ( @xmath18 ) , zero plasma viscosity and anomalous resistivity that is a piecewise linear function of the electric current [ see eq .",
    "( [ linear_resistivity ] ) ] .",
    "there are two major results of the kulsrud anomalous reconnection model .",
    "first , in the case of the petschek geometry of the reconnection layer and a constant resistivity , one has to calculate the half - length of the reconnection layer @xmath4 from the mhd equations and the jump conditions on the petschek shocks , instead of treating @xmath4 as a free parameter ( as petschek did ) .",
    "when the layer half - length @xmath4 is calculated correctly , it turns out to be approximately equal to the global magnetic field scale , @xmath19 . in this case",
    "the petschek reconnection reduces to the slow sweet - parker reconnection  @xcite .",
    "this theoretical result is in agreement with the results of numerical simulations of two - dimensional reconnection with constant resistivity  @xcite .",
    "the second major result of the kulsrud reconnection model is that in the case when resistivity is anomalous and enhanced ( e.g. by plasma instabilities ) , the reconnection rate becomes considerably faster than the sweet - parker rate .    in this paper",
    "we develop and use a new theoretical approach for calculation of the reconnection rate in the case of anomalous resistivity .",
    "this approach is based on application of the mhd equations in a small region , which is localized at the geometric center of a thin reconnection layer ( point o in fig .",
    "[ fig_reconnection_layer ] ) and has a size of order of the layer half - thickness @xmath20 .",
    "it turns out that by using local analytical calculations in a thin reconnection layer , we can derive an accurate and rather precise estimate for the reconnection rate .",
    "in particular , we find the interesting and important result that a quasi - stationary reconnection rate is fully determined by the anomalous resistivity function and by the magnetic field configuration just outside the reconnection layer ( at point m in fig .",
    "[ fig_reconnection_layer ] ) .",
    "the underlying physical foundations of our analytical derivations are , of course , the same as those previously used by others  @xcite . however , our theoretical and computational approach is somewhat different from the conventional approach to the reconnection problem , and we explain the difference in the next section .",
    "there are three main benefits of our novel theoretical approach to magnetic reconnection .",
    "first , our approach allows us to extend the results for anomalous reconnection obtained by kulsrud in 2001  @xcite to a general anomalous reconnection case , when the guide field and plasma viscosity are arbitrary and anomalous resistivity @xmath21 is an arbitrary function of the electric current and the two spatial coordinates .",
    "second , it gives a new important insight into the reconnection problem , such as dependence of the reconnection rate on magnetic field configuration just outside the reconnection layer .",
    "third , our approach , based on local calculations , is applicable to cases when there is no well - defined global magnetic field structure , such as the case of multiple current sheets in a turbulent plasma . in our calculations",
    "we make only a few assumptions , which are described in detail in the beginning of sec .",
    "[ new_model ] .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "because our derivations are rather complicated in the general case of reconnection with anomalous resistivity , we find it useful and instructive to consider the sweet - parker reconnection first and to compare our theoretical approach to the classical sweet - parker calculations in the next section . in sec .",
    "[ new_model ] , we derive our general equations for magnetic reconnection with anomalous resistivity , including the equation for the reconnection rate . in sec .",
    "[ reconnection_limits ] we consider and analyze different special cases of magnetic reconnection , in which our equations simplify and become easier for analysis and comparison to the previous theoretical and simulation results . in sec .",
    "[ simulations ] we present the results of our numerical simulations of unforced anomalous magnetic reconnection .",
    "these simulations are intended for a demonstration of the predictions of our theoretical reconnection model for the special case of the piecewise linear resistivity function that was considered by kulsrud  @xcite . finally , in sec .  [ conclusions ] we give our conclusions and discuss our results .",
    "some derivations are given in the appendices of the paper .",
    "for simplicity and brevity , hereafter in the paper for all electromagnetic variables we use physical units in which the speed of light and four times @xmath22 are replaced unity , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . to rewrite our equations in the standard cgs units , one needs to make the following substitutions for electromagnetic variables in the equations : magnetic field @xmath25 , electric field @xmath26 , electric current @xmath27 , resistivity @xmath28 ( does not change ) , magnetic field vector potential @xmath29 .",
    "in this section we consider sweet - parker reconnection  @xcite .",
    "we assume that resistivity is constant , @xmath30 , the plasma viscosity is zero , the guide field is zero ( @xmath18 ) , and the geometry of the reconnection layer is the classical sweet - parker geometry with the layer half - thickness @xmath31 and the layer half - length @xmath32 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_reconnection_layer ] .",
    "the purpose of this section is to introduce and explain our new theoretical approach to calculation of the reconnection rate and to compare it with the classical sweet - parker calculations . for this purpose",
    ", we first present the classical , conventional derivation of the sweet - parker formula for the reconnection rate , and afterward we present our new derivation of the formula and explain the difference between the two derivations .    in the case of a quasi - stationary reconnection the magnetic field in the reconnection region changes slowly in time , @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , in the two - and - a - half - dimensional geometry ( @xmath34 ) the faraday s law equation @xmath35 results in the z - component of the electric field being constant in the reconnection region , @xmath36 and @xmath37 is a function of time only .",
    "on the other hand , in two - and - a - half dimensions the @xmath0- and @xmath1-components of faraday s law equation @xmath38)$ ] reduce to the following equation for the z - component of the magnetic vector potential @xmath39 : -e_z(t)&=&a_z / t= -(*v*)a_z+^2 a_z + & = & v_xb_y - v_yb_x - j_z .",
    "[ mhd_equation ] ( the resistivity @xmath30 is constant in the sweet - parker reconnection case , but equation  ( [ mhd_equation ] ) is general and is valid even if resistivity @xmath21 is anomalous and non - constant . )    now , the left- and right - hand - sides of equation  ( [ mhd_equation ] ) are constant in space . therefore , the right - hand - side of equation  ( [ mhd_equation ] ) is constant across the reconnection layer ( i.e.  along the x - axis ) .",
    "we equate its values at points o and m , which are on the x - axis and are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_reconnection_layer ] . as a result",
    ", we immediately obtain _",
    "oj_o = v_rb_m , [ first_mhd ] where we use the following notations : point o is the geometric center of the reconnection layer , where the z - component of the current is @xmath40 and the plasma velocity is zero .",
    "point m is a point on the x - axis just outside the reconnection layer , where the resistivity term can be neglected in equation  ( [ mhd_equation ] ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig_reconnection_layer ] .",
    "we also use the notations @xmath41 and @xmath42 for the y - component of the field and x - component of the plasma velocity at point m , and take the reconnection velocity @xmath16 positive . note that @xmath43 at point m because of the symmetry of the problem with respect to the x - axis .",
    "next , we estimate current @xmath44 at the central point o of the reconnection layer as j_ob_m/_o , [ j_o ] where @xmath20 is the reconnection layer half - thickness , and we use ampere s law , @xmath45 , in which we drop the @xmath46 term because the reconnection layer is thin  , then obviously the length of the layer would be of the order of its thickness . ] .",
    "next , consider the x- and y - components of the equation of plasma motion .",
    "we will see below that the sweet - parker reconnection is slow , @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , in the equation of plasma motion along the x - axis ( i.e.  across the reconnection layer ) the inertial term can be neglected , and this equation becomes the force balance equation , @xmath48 , resulting in @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the values of the plasma pressure at points o and m. here we use the fact that the magnetic field is zero at the central point o because of the symmetry of the problem . as far as the equation of plasma motion along the y - axis ( i.e  along the layer ) is concerned , the y - components of the magnetic tension force and the pressure gradient force are approximately equal in the sweet - parker reconnection case .",
    "indeed , on the y - axis the tension force can be estimated as @xmath52 . here",
    "we estimate the x - component of the field as @xmath53 because @xmath14 is produced by the rotation of the @xmath54 field component in the reconnection layer  @xcite , and in the sweet - parker model it is assumed that the downstream pressure is equal to the upstream pressure @xmath51 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the pressure and magnetic tension forces accelerate plasma along the reconnection layer ( i.e.  along the y - axis ) up to the downstream velocity @xmath55 , which can be estimated from the energy conservation equation ( 1/2)v_out^2b_m^2/2 v_outv_ab_m/. [ sp_energy ] this equation means that the work done by the pressure and magnetic tension forces along the entire reconnection layer is equal to the kinetic energy of the plasma in the downstream regions .",
    "finally , in the sweet - parker reconnection model the plasma is assumed to be incompressible .",
    "therefore , the mass conservation condition for the entire reconnection layer results in lv_r_ov_out , [ sp_mass ] where @xmath55 , the velocity of plasma outflow in the downstream regions , is given by equation  ( [ sp_energy ] ) . using equations  ( [ first_mhd])-([sp_mass ] ) , we obtain the formula for the sweet - parker reconnection velocity  @xcite , v_rv_a(_o / v_al)^1/2 .",
    "[ sp_speed ]    equations  ( [ first_mhd])-([sp_speed ] ) are the classical sweet - parker equations .",
    "note that equations  ( [ first_mhd ] ) ,  ( [ j_o ] ) and  ( [ sp_speed ] ) are local , in the sense that they are written for a small region of space , which is localized at the geometric center of a thin reconnection layer ( point o in fig .",
    "[ fig_reconnection_layer ] ) and has a size of order of the layer half - thickness @xmath20 .",
    "all physical quantities that enter these three equations are defined in this small region of space . at the same time equations  ( [ sp_energy ] ) and  ( [ sp_mass ] )",
    "are global , in the sense that they result from consideration of the entire reconnection layer and they include the plasma outflow velocity @xmath56 , which is a physical quantity in the downstream regions at the ends of the reconnection layer . in our new theoretical approach to the calculation of the reconnection rate",
    "we intend to use only local equations .",
    "our intent and our derivations will be justified by the new and important results that we obtain in the next section of this paper and discuss in sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] . at present , let us explain our theoretical approach for the simple case of sweet - parker reconnection that we consider in this section .    in the derivation of our theoretical model for magnetic reconnection we keep equations  ( [ first_mhd ] ) and  ( [ j_o ] ) unchanged because these equations are local . however , we rewrite equations  ( [ sp_energy ] ) and  ( [ sp_mass ] ) because they are global . to rewrite these two global equations in a local form",
    ", we consider a point @xmath57 that is located on the y - axis in an infinitesimal vicinity of the reconnection layer central point o ( see fig .  [ fig_reconnection_layer ] ) and has an infinitesimally small value of its y - coordinate @xmath58 .",
    "since @xmath59 , along the o@xmath60 interval we can use the up - to - the - first - order taylor expansions @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 for the values of the perpendicular magnetic field @xmath14 , plasma velocity @xmath64 and z - component of the current @xmath65 .",
    "these expansions are along the y - axis , and , of course , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the first - order partial derivatives of @xmath14 and @xmath64 at point o ( note that @xmath68 ) .",

    "on the right - hand - side of equation  ( [ sp_local_energy ] ) we keep only the magnetic tension force for plasma acceleration because , as we found above , in the sweet - parker reconnection case the y - components of the magnetic tension and pressure gradient forces are approximately equal to each other ( note that in our general calculations in the next section we will take all forces into account ) .",
    "next , equation  ( [ sp_mass ] ) for the mass conservation of an incompressible plasma can easily be rewritten in the local form inside the area om@xmath69@xmath60 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_reconnection_layer ] as @xmath70 .",

    "however , in our theoretical model we have an additional unknown parameter @xmath66 , which does not directly enter the classical sweet - parker reconnection model . as a result , we need one additional equation to be able to calculate the reconnection rate under the framework of our local model .",
    "this additional equation comes from the condition that the right - hand - side of equation  ( [ mhd_equation ] ) is constant not only across the reconnection layer , but also along the layer that is along the y - axis .",
    "this condition is not explicitly used in the sweet - parker model , but it is used in our model , and this is the second major difference between the two models . to derive the additional equation , used in our reconnection model , we differentiate the left- and right - hand - sides of equation  ( [ mhd_equation ] ) along the y - axis ( i.e.  along the reconnection layer ) . the first order partial derivatives @xmath74 are identically zero because of the symmetry of the problem with respect to the x - axis .",

    "the reader of this paper could question why we develop and suggest a new theoretical approach to the problem of quasi - stationary magnetic reconnection if we obtain the same results in the sweet - parker reconnection case .",
    "the answer is that our approach , based on local calculations , allows us to calculate the reconnection rate in the case of anomalous resistivity and also provides an additional important understanding of the reconnection problem .",

    "[ conclusions ] .",

    "this is because in the petschek model @xmath196 can be estimated as the ratio of the plasma outflow velocity ( equal to the alfven velocity for viscosity - free plasma ) and the reconnection layer length , @xmath197 , and the layer length @xmath4 is treated as a free parameter by petschek . in his model",
    "@xmath4 is taken to be equal to the minimal possible value , that the petschek shocks do not seriously perturb the magnetic field in the upstream region .",
    "this is @xmath198 , where @xmath199 is the lundquist number  @xcite . in this case",
    "@xmath200 and , according to equations  ( [ v_r ] ) and  ( [ upsilon ] ) , the reconnection velocity in this case is equal to @xmath201 , which is the petschek result . on the other hand , in our theoretical model",
    "the parameter @xmath196 is not treated as a free parameter .",
    "in fact , our three physical parameters @xmath67 , @xmath66 and @xmath202 are connected to each other and must be calculated from equations  ( [ b_energy ] ) ,  ( [ second_mhd ] ) and  ( [ third_mhd ] ) .",
    "let us discuss the meaning of these equations .",
    "equation  ( [ b_energy ] ) is the equation of magnetic energy conservation .",
    "it says that the rate of supply of the magnetic field energy into the reconnection layer @xmath203 must be equal to the rate of the resistive dissipation of this energy @xmath204 . in the petschek model @xmath196 and , accordingly , the rate of the magnetic energy supply @xmath203 are basically prescribed by hand ( resulting in an _ ad hoc _ fast reconnection ) , while in our model they are self - consistently calculated from the mhd equations .",
    "equation  ( [ second_mhd ] ) is the equation of plasma acceleration along the reconnection layer .",
    "it says that the magnetic tension force @xmath110 must be large enough in order to be able to push out all the plasma along the layer that is supplied into the layer .",
    "finally , equation  ( [ third_mhd ] ) is the equation of spatial homogeneity of the electric field z - component along the reconnection layer .",
    "this equation sets an upper limit on the product @xmath205 in the case of a quasi - stationary reconnection and is directly related to the calculations and arguments given by kulsrud  @xcite in the framework of the global - equations theoretical approach , see ref .",
    "are directly related to the explanation of why the petschek reconnection model does not work , as shown by kulsrud  @xcite in the framework of the global - equations .",
    "kulsrud s argument is that the length of petschek reconnection layer @xmath4 is not a free parameter , but must be determined by the condition that the perpendicular magnetic field component @xmath14 has to be regenerated by the rotation of the parallel field component @xmath54 at the same rate as it is being swept away by the downstream flow .",
    "it is easy to see that the integration of `` local '' equation  ( [ mhd_equation ] ) without the resistivity term over the area of the contour o@xmath206m@xmath206@xmath69@xmath206@xmath60 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_reconnection_layer ] will result in the same `` global '' equation for the balance of the @xmath14 field , which was used by kulsrud in his work  @xcite . ] . as a result",
    ", none of parameters @xmath196 , @xmath207 and @xmath44 can be treated as free parameters , and all of them must be self - consistently determined from the mhd equations .",
    "it is very instructive to briefly examine our results from the two distinct points of view in connection with the reconnection problem , which are expressed in numerous papers on computer simulation of magnetic reconnection .",
    "these two points of view are : unforced ( free ) magnetic reconnection and forced magnetic reconnection . in the case of unforced reconnection",
    ", one should solve our main equation  ( [ rate ] ) for the current @xmath44 at the reconnection layer center and then solve for the reconnection velocity @xmath16 by using equation  ( [ v_r ] ) .",
    "the solution for @xmath44 and @xmath16 will depend on @xmath120 , which is the strength of the magnetic field outside the reconnection layer and which enters the right - hand - side of equation  ( [ rate ] ) . on the other hand , in the case of forced magnetic reconnection the reconnection velocity @xmath16 is prescribed and fixed . in this case",
    "the magnetic field outside the reconnection layer @xmath120 should be treated as an unknown quantity , and equations  ( [ rate ] ) and  ( [ v_r ] ) should be solved together in order to find the correct quasi - stationary values of @xmath44 and @xmath120 . in other words , in the forced reconnection case an initially weak outside magnetic field @xmath120 gets piled up to higher and higher values until the resulting current @xmath44 in the reconnection layer becomes large enough to be able to exactly match the prescribed reconnection velocity @xmath16 and to be able to reconnect all magnetic flux and magnetic energy , which are supplied into the reconnection region in the quasi - stationary reconnection regime .",
    "finally , a couple of words about plasma viscosity and guide field and their effect on magnetic reconnection .",
    "first , according to our equations  ( [ rate ] ) and  ( [ v_r ] ) , in the case when the resistivity is constant , @xmath30 , and the plasma viscosity is much larger than resistivity , @xmath137 , the reconnection velocity becomes @xmath208 , which is @xmath209{\\nu/\\eta_o}$ ] times smaller than the sweet - parker reconnection velocity given by formula  ( [ sp_reconnection ] ) , see  @xcite .",
    "thus , we see that the reconnection rate becomes smaller when the plasma viscosity becomes large . however , note that in many astrophysical and laboratory applications plasmas are very hot and highly rarefied . under these conditions",
    "the ion gyro - radius becomes much shorter than the ion mean - free - path , and the plasma becomes strongly magnetized . as a result ,",
    "the plasma viscosity becomes the braginskii viscosity , which is dominated by magnetized ions  @xcite . in this case in all our equations above the isotropic viscosity @xmath90 , which is proportional to the ion mean - free - path , should be replaced by the braginskii perpendicular viscosity , which is proportional to the ion gyro - radius and is much smaller than the perpendicular viscosity in a strongly magnetized plasma .",
    "second , according to our results , in two - and - a - half dimensional geometry the guide field @xmath88 has no effect on the quasi - stationary reconnection rate .",
    "indeed , in our derivations the guide field appears only as magnetic pressure @xmath102 term in addition to the plasma pressure .",
    "the combined pressure @xmath101 enters equations  ( [ v_y_equation ] ) and  ( [ v_y_equation_2 ] ) of plasma acceleration along the reconnection layer and the value of spatial derivative of @xmath101 is given by equation  ( [ pressure_term ] ) , which does not involve @xmath88 .",
    "thus , the guide field gets eliminated and does not enter into our final equation  ( [ rate ] ) for the reconnection rate . however ,",
    "if one assumes that the anomalous resistivity @xmath21 depends on x- and y - components of the current @xmath210 and @xmath211 in addition to its dependence on the z - component of the current @xmath65 , then the reconnection rate will depend on the guide field @xmath88 .",
    "in this paper we consider quasi - stationary magnetic reconnection in a thin reconnection layer .",
    "we leave a study of tearing modes instability in a reconnection layer and non - quasi - stationary reconnection for a future paper .",
    "it is our special pleasure to thank ellen zweibel and dmitri uzdensky for many stimulating discussions and useful comments .",
    "we are grateful to zoran mikic and samuel vainshtein for suggesting to us the convenient computational setup used in our simulations .",
    "we would also like to thank andrey beresnyak , amitava bhattacharjee , stas boldyrev , fausto cattaneo , jeremy goodman , hantao ji , alexander obabko , robert rosner and masaaki yamada for a number of valuable comments .",

    "the derivation is somewhat analogous to the sweet - parker derivation of the pressure decrease along the reconnection layer , which leads to equation  ( [ sp_energy ] ) .",
