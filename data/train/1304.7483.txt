    "it has long been known that rotation curves of galaxies disagree with newton s law .",
    "famaey and mcgaugh have recently provided a review of all aspects of the data , with an exhaustive list of references @xcite .",
    "the most relevant astrophysical data will be discussed here .    in 1983 , milgrom proposed a modification of newtonian mechanics called mond ( modified newtonian dynamics ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this has three distinct features .",
    "firstly , the observed total acceleration @xmath4 depends on the newtonian acceleration @xmath5 as @xmath6 @xmath7 is an empirical smooth function of @xmath8 ; @xmath0 is a universal constant @xmath9 m s@xmath10 for all galaxies .",
    "the second feature is that for vanishingly small @xmath5 , @xmath11 thirdly , galactic dynamics are invariant under scaling of time and space for very low @xmath5 : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a scaling factor @xcite .",
    "a star with rotational velocity @xmath14 in equilibrium with centrifugal force satisfies @xmath15 @xmath16 is the gravitational constant and @xmath17 the galactic mass within radius @xmath18 ; so @xmath18 cancels and @xmath19 this agrees well with the empirical tully - fisher relation between observed velocities at the edges of galaxies and their luminosities @xcite .",
    "mcgaugh showed that this relation applies over @xmath20 decades of galactic masses from @xmath21 to @xmath22 after including the mass of gas and dust in each galaxy @xcite .",
    "it is important that in mond there is only one free parameter @xmath0 , fitted to all galaxies once a particular form for @xmath23 has been chosen .    in the @xmath24 cosmological model",
    ", the parameter @xmath0 does not appear .",
    "there are three recent papers pointing out that a shift of paradigm is required to describe the data more precisely @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "kroupa et al . and famaey et al .",
    "discuss simulations based on the standard cosmological model @xmath24 .",
    "they both point out the prediction that the main dark matter halo hosting a large galaxy like the milky way should produce 100600 roughly isotropic sub - halos .",
    "however , the milky way has only 24 satellites ( and andromeda @xmath25 @xcite ) which are highly correlated in both radial and momentum phase space .",
    "they lie mostly within rotationally supported thin discs .",
    "this has been strongly confirmed by ibata et al .",
    "these authors all conclude that @xmath24 is at best incomplete and misses essential physics .",
    "there is a further interesting paper of l \" ughausen et al . concerning a polar ring galaxy @xcite .",
    "this galaxy has a small bright gas - poor disc with a large central bulge , but in addition an orthogonal gas - rich disc , referred to as a polar ring .",
    "they show that the observed velocities in both discs are well predicted by mond .",
    "another @xmath24 prediction is that dwarf galaxies formed from tidal material during galaxy encounters can not contain substantial amounts of dark matter ; mond fits them well .",
    "mcgaugh and milgrom @xcite make an important comment that tidal effects of large galaxies on their satellite galaxies must be taken into account in drawing conclusions about the satellites .",
    "the objective of the present paper is to search for an explanation of the observed discrepancies .",
    "the conventional @xmath24 paradigm is that dark matter condenses gravitationally and then galaxies form inside this condensate .",
    "this is a two - step process .",
    "the procedure adopted here is to use commonly used forms of milgrom s @xmath7 function to determine the non - newtonian component of the acceleration observed at the edges of galaxies ; it peaks at or close to @xmath0 where it is bigger than @xmath5 by a large factor @xmath26 .",
    "this acceleration is then integrated to determine the associated energy function .",
    "the result fits naturally to a fermi function with the same negative sign as that of gravity .",
    "the fermi function lowers the total energy by @xmath27 at radius @xmath28 where @xmath5 reaches @xmath0 ; here @xmath17 is the mass within radius @xmath28 .",
    "this fermi function takes the same form as the energy gap observed in doped semiconductors .",
    "it is adopted as the effective hamiltonian for the non - newtonian interaction .",
    "it is interpreted as evidence that a fermi - dirac condensate forms in the graviton - nucleon interaction ( not the gravitational interaction itself ) near radius @xmath28 .",
    "there are then four further clues which fit like a glove to the existence of this condensate .",
    "one is that @xmath29 within experimental errors ; here @xmath3 is the velocity of light and @xmath2 is the local value of the hubble acceleration .",
    "this results in a direct relation between @xmath0 and dark energy .",
    "dark matter is no longer needed in this one - step process .",
    "most discussions of galactic rotation curves use the asymptotic form of the acceleration . here",
    "attention is focussed on accelerations close to @xmath0 , between @xmath30 and @xmath31 m s@xmath10 .",
    "an independent observation of the role of @xmath0 has appeared in globular clusters within the last few years",
    ". these spherical clusters of stars have dimensions of a few parsec ( pc ) , i.e. a factor @xmath32 smaller than the milky way .",
    "they are believed to be the remnants of dwarf galaxies , some old and some quite young .",
    "scarpa et al .",
    "reported initially on two globular clusters situated 1619 kpc from the milky way @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium of such clusters is controlled by jeans law .",
    "scarpa et al .",
    "traced the velocity dispersion of 184 stars at large radius , identified as being members of one globular cluster ( rather than interlopers ) , and 146 stars in the second cluster .",
    "the velocity dispersion is maximal at the centre of each cluster .",
    "they traced it to a radius twice that where @xmath5 reaches @xmath0 .",
    "velocity dispersions deviate rather abruptly from @xmath5 as it decreases through @xmath0 .",
    "tidal heating by the milky way varies as @xmath33 , and is at least one order of magnitude smaller , making its effect negligible .",
    "scarpa et al . have made observations of a further 6 globular clusters .",
    "hernandez and jim ' enez give the algebra relating velocity dispersions of stars to newtonian acceleration using jeans law @xcite .",
    "hernandez , jim ' enez and allen report a detailed study of the velocity dispersion profiles of all 8 globular clusters @xcite .",
    "like scarpa et al . , they conclude that tidal effects are significant only at radii larger by factors 210 than the radius where mond flattens the curves .",
    "they also show that the velocity dispersion @xmath34 varies with the mass @xmath17 of the cluster as @xmath35 within errors ; this is the expected analogue of the tully - fisher relation arising from jeans law .",
    "this result is independent of luminosity measurements used in interpreting galactic rotation curves . in galaxies ,",
    "the mass @xmath17 within a particular radius is not easy to determine , and is usually taken as the mass where rotation curves flatten out .",
    "further study of globular clusters is desirable",
    ".    differences between the @xmath7 functions used for mond are illustrated in fig .",
    "19 of the review of famaey and mcgaugh @xcite .",
    "the smoothest form , given by milgrom @xcite , is used here : @xmath36 the algebraic form with which globular clusters are fitted is closely consistent with this equation .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 presents in fig .",
    "1(a ) the observed acceleration on the logarithmic scale of @xmath5 adopted by milgrom @xcite ; it gives the algebra for the chosen form of @xmath37 , where @xmath38 . from this ,",
    "the difference between the observed acceleration and @xmath5 is derived and shown in fig .",
    "this is then integrated to find its associated energy function @xmath39 , fig .",
    "i follow the convention that the zero of the newtonian potential is taken locally , ignoring the effects of dark energy over the universe as a whole .",
    "the height of the fermi function may be interpreted as an energy gap .",
    "there is further evidence of quantum mechanics at work .",
    "the asymptotic form of the total acceleration can likewise be integrated . in section 3 , this is shown to lead to a weak logarithmic tail to the newtonian potential .",
    "the interpretation is that quantum mechanical mixing between the newtonian potential and the asymptotic form allows the wavelength of gravitons trapped in the newtonian potential to expand .",
    "this lowers the zero - point energy .",
    "these two indications of quantum effects should not be surprising .",
    "hawking has demonstrated that quantum mechanics plays an important role in the physics of black holes @xcite , where the acceleration is very large .",
    "a standard particle physics result is that the graviton - nucleon interaction should obey a dispersion relation as a function of the amplitude of @xmath5 ( with a non - analytic logarithmic term in addition ) .",
    "gravitons with a wavelength of galactic dimensions are at the extreme infra - red end of the spectrum . with such a wavelength",
    ", a single graviton interacts coherently with nucleons over complete clusters of stars .",
    "section 3 examines the idea that there is quantum mechanical mixing between @xmath5 and the hubble acceleration .",
    "this mixing is a well known effect in particle spectroscopy for two eigenfunctions having different basis states .",
    "the standard treatment is to use the bogoliubov - valatin transformation @xcite @xcite , which leads to the breit - rabi equation for the mixing .",
    "section 4 relates the observed asymptotic acceleration to dark energy and a subtle connection with the hubble acceleration .",
    "subsection 4.1 then draws an analogy with condensed matter physics and the well understood symmetry breaking in particle physics .",
    "section 5 makes extensive comments on avenues for further work and section 6 summarises conclusion .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    from equation ( 6 ) , @xmath40 the cancellation of the two terms @xmath41 is typical of a dispersion relation and emerges as an important point in section 3 .",

    "it is inconvenient to use axes to the base 10 , so they will be replaced in the algebra which follows by conversion to @xmath42 . from eq .",

    "[ there are higher order terms too . ] the curvature @xmath47 has a maximum value at @xmath48 , where @xmath49 .    in galaxies ,",
    "perturbations arise from thermal and pressure effects .",
    "some narrow structures are observed in rotation curves , for example from bars in large galaxies .",
    "these may be fitted empirically using poisson s equation for mass structures appearing in the gravitational potential .",
    "the mond component ` rides ' such structures smoothly , see figs .",
    "21 and 29 of famaey and mcgaugh @xcite .",
    "an immediate question is why planck s constant does not appear in results for galactic rotation curves .",
    "the reason is that galaxies are noisy enough to hide it .    using @xmath1 ,",
    "the maximum curvature is expected at @xmath50 m @xmath51 , i.e. @xmath52 .",
    "mcgaugh summarises a large number of papers comparing the tully - fisher relation with models of galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "he concludes that gas rich galaxies give the best determination of the baryonic masses of galaxies : @xmath53 m @xmath51 .",
    "a slightly lower value @xmath54 is found by gentile , famaey and de blok @xcite .",
    "1(b ) shows @xmath47 as a peak @xmath55 in the acceleration at @xmath0 , marked by the dashed line ; here @xmath56 is the energy of the ` extra ' contribution .",

    "the conclusion is that galaxies have considerable stability .",
    "other forms for @xmath62 have been used to fit galactic rotation curves .",
    "two common examples are ( a ) @xmath63 , ( b ) @xmath64 .",
    "both forms have the effect of moving the peak of the curvature slightly : from @xmath65 to @xmath66 for a and to @xmath67 for b. the height of the peak for a is scaled by a factor 0.78 and the curve becomes correspondingly wider , resulting in a tail reaching 0.012 at @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the result for fig .",
    "1(c ) is that the top of the fermi function is @xmath70 of @xmath71 lower , and the bottom of the curve higher by the same amount , but the central part of the fermi function is unchanged and still centred very close to @xmath65 .",
    "form b produces the converse effect : a higher , narrower peak in fig .",
    "1(b ) and a fermi function beginning closer to the top and finishing closer to the bottom of fig .",

    "a detail is that one might consider the possibility that the smooth curve of fig .",
    "1(a ) could be derived from the dashed and dotted lines .",
    "this would give rise to a sharp cusp in fig .",
    "such cusps are known in particle physics , but arise only at the opening of phase space for a new reaction channel @xcite .",

    "this is a familiar result in particle physics .",
    "historically , it was first observed in variations of atomic energy levels in a magnetic field .",
    "it arises there from differences in magnetic moments for different levels , some of which share one component .",

    "1(a ) by an offset of @xmath124 in @xmath61 .",

    "the dependence of the fit on alternative forms of milgrom s @xmath7 function was tested .",
    "although acceleration curves change significantly , the fermi function is affected only at the ends of the range @xmath138 to @xmath139 by at most @xmath140 .",

    "a coherence length was introduced by pippard to account for the effects of defects beyond an experimentally observed range @xcite .",
    "it appears that galaxies behave similarly .",
    "if gravitons acquire an effective mass , it appears at first sight that this will weaken gravity .",
    "however , remember that the wave - lengths of gravitons on a galactic scale are very large . the spectrum of gravitons near the edge of the galaxy is a convolution of gravitons from the rest of the galaxy .",
    "gravitons from the galactic centre become almost plane waves which can interact coherently over a large volume .",
    "they function like phonons coupling to cooper pairs in a superconductor producing an energy gap . a coherence length like that introduced by pippard can arise in many ways .",
    "supernovae act as major perturbations , heating sizable volumes .",
    "it is also known that so - called chimneys and wormholes provide channels through which currents of dust and gas flow .",
    "furthermore , one of the remarkable features of galaxies is that they only grow to a certain size .",
    "the largest have masses of order @xmath141 .",
    "this can be attributed to the rapid fall - off of the ` extra ' acceleration due to mond close to @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "all of these effects point to a coherence length due to the variation of the fermi function in fig .",
    "let us return to a simpler issue , the missing lower branch of the breit - rabi equation . on this branch both @xmath56 and @xmath125 change sign .",
    "the change of sign requires that this branch describes an excited state rather than a condensate .",
    "( remember that energies of both gravity and @xmath39 are negative ) .",
    "such an excited state is likely to decay on a time scale much less than that of galaxies , so it is unlikely that this branch will be observable . for those wishing to investigate this branch , the procedure is ( a ) to fit the upper branch as a function of @xmath61 , ( b ) rotate to @xmath84 axes , ( c ) reverse the sign of @xmath144 to reach the lower branch , and ( d ) rotate axes back again to @xmath122 .",
    "the best place to search for this branch is near the crossing point of fig .",
    "experiment tells us that in galaxies , the asymptotic form of the acceleration is @xmath97 .",
    "this leads to the question : what governs the asymptotic acceleration ?",
    "if mond successfully models the formation of galaxies and globular clusters , it raises the question of how to interpret dark energy . in a de sitter universe",
    ", the friedmann - robertson - walker model smoothes out structures using a @xmath24 function which models the gross features .",
    "these change over the lifetime of the universe .",
    "however , if quantum mechanics governs individual galaxies , there will instead be fine structure in dark energy .",
    "it is logical that steps like figs .",
    "1(c ) do not just average out , but instead accumulate over all of this fine structure .",
    "the standard treatment of dark energy is reviewed by sami @xcite .",
    "the acceleration falls initially due to newtonian cosmology .",
    "however , at recent times , the acceleration increases . this acceleration can be explained naturally by the sum total of the fine structure over all the galaxies .",
    "the total acceleration is parametrised via the assumed time dependence of the metric on the hubble acceleration .",
    "a similar suggestion along these lines has been advanced by zhang and li @xcite using ideas based on entropic arguments . the ` present - day '",
    "hubble acceleration is the local value and varies over the universe according to the parametrisation by dark energy .",
    "there is a further argument pointing towards the idea that local fine structure is cumulative .",
    "peebles and nusser argue that galaxies condense more rapidly than the standard @xmath24 model predicts @xcite .",
    "in particular , they point out that the local void contains far fewer galaxies than @xmath24 predicts statistically , while there is an unexpected presence of large galaxies on the outskirts of the local void .",
    "their fig .",
    "1 is very persuasive in this respect .",
    "only 3 galaxies are observed in the local void compared with 19 predicted .",
    "the poisson probability for this result is of the order @xmath145 from @xmath24 .",
    "peebles and nusser conclude : ` in short , the general sensitivity of galaxies to their environment is not expected in standard ideas . it would help if galaxies were more rapidly assembled so that they could then evolve as more nearly isolated island universes . '",
    "later peebles considered an additional empirical term added to the @xmath24 model , but commented that the change requires that cold dark matter is cored rather than the expected cusped behaviour @xcite .",
    "a natural explanation is that the local void gives no contribution to the hubble mechanism , except for its three galaxies .",
    "the total energy @xmath146 is then higher there . on the periphery of the void",
    ", there is gas and dust which can form galaxies .",
    "this gas runs down the energy gap to enlarge galaxies forming there .",
    "galaxies then grow by accumulation of dust and gas .",
    "the condensate at the edge of the galaxy acts as a funnel to collect gas and dust . towards the centres of galaxies",
    ", they can develop in different ways depending on the angular momentum @xmath147 of the galaxy . for large @xmath147 , they naturally form flat discs . for lower @xmath147 ,",
    "bulges develop and spiral arms ; these features can vary according to whether the galaxy is supported by rotation or pressure or both . for really low @xmath147 ,",
    "large elliptical galaxies and dwarf spherical galaxies develop .",
    "if @xmath147 is close to 0 , galaxies collapse as quasars .",
    "it appears that @xmath24 is presently fitting all these different morphologies with a very flexible ansatz for dark matter .",
    "so far , dark matter has escaped experimental detection .",
    "there are speculations that it may take the form of sterile neutrinos with masses in the electron - volt range . at a recent conference on neutrino physics ,",
    "altarelli commented on this question @xcite .",
    "he argued that more than one sterile neutrino is disfavoured by stringent bounds arising from nucleo - synthesis .",
    "also there is tension between lsnd , miniboone and karmen experiments leaving little room for a signal .",
    "rubbia et al .",
    "propose a new neutrino detector icarus - nessie to run at cern with parameters optimised for finding sterile neutrinos @xcite .",
    "there is also speculation about grand unified theories in which massive right - handed neutrinos couple weakly to left - handed light neutrinos .",
    "such heavy neutrinos would have formed in the big bang before the generation of the cosmic microwave background . if these heavy neutrinos survive and mix with light neutrinos , their lifetimes must be larger than the age of the universe , otherwise there would be effects visible in dark energy .",
    "well known examples of condensates are ferromagnets and anti - ferromagnets . in ferromagnets , spins align parallel with one another below the curie point ; in the absence of a magnetic field , the overall spin can lie in any direction . in anti - ferromagnets they spontaneously align anti - parallel .",
    "the ground - states of these systems have a lower symmetry than the hamiltonian .",
    "this is a purely quantum effect , but difficult to calculate from first principles .",
    "however , neutron scattering experiments establish the structures . in astrophysics ,",
    "the situation is difficult because one can only watch how galaxies evolve .    in particle physics .",
    "we now know that the strong interaction is mediated by massless gluons obeying chiral symmetry , i.e. they do not discriminate between left - hands and right - hands . below a mass of @xmath148 gev , the gluon acquires an effective mass from its interaction with light quarks , which themselves have masses of @xmath149 and 9 mev .",
    "the electroweak theory is constructed from a mixing between electromagnetism and weak interactions carried by @xmath56 and @xmath150 particles and probably the higgs boson .",
    "a side - effect of this idea is that chiral symmetry is broken in the strong interactions for spin 0 particles below 1 gev .",
    "this idea was introduced by gasser and leutwyler @xcite and today gives many quantitatively accurate results in meson spectroscopy .",
    "an important step in understanding the precise mechanism was made by bicudo and ribiero @xcite .",
    "their work finds the bogoliubov - valatin transformation to be an essential element . above 1 gev",
    ", there is a cross - over in which chiral symmetry is largely restored and the quark model reigns supreme , though with small amounts of mixing with meson - meson and/or @xmath151 basis states .",
    "a recent paper of pennington and wilson gives details including figures showing the cross - over at 1 gev @xcite .",
    "a precise set of equations describing chiral symmetry breaking is given by cherney et al .",
    "this work shows that gauge invariance requires that quarks must be treated as ` dressed ' fermions , rather than bare fermions .",
    "their conclusion is that a yukawa potential appears explicitly in the @xmath152 interaction , their eq .",
    "this increases the fermion mass from a few mev to the so - called constituent mass , @xmath153 mev . in their eq .",
    "( 72 ) , a logarithmic term appears from feynman diagrams where one pair of particles rescatter to themselves through a closed loop .",
    "the origin of chiral symmetry breaking is that quarks have small masses ; if these were zero , the pion would be massless .    in summary , it is clear that there are three gauge fields : ( i ) gluons , ( ii ) electromagnetism linked to weak interactions , and ( iii ) gravity .",
    "effective masses do arise in the first two .",
    "there has been a paper by van dam and veltman @xcite claiming a no - go theorem preventing the graviton developing a mass .",
    "this theorem appears to refer purely to an isolated graviton obeying general relativity . that is different to the present case where the condensate is a property of the graviton - nucleon interaction .",
    "there is an important point if gravitons develop an effective mass . in particle physics",
    ", there are relations between scattering processes such as @xmath154 , @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",
    "amplitudes depend on @xmath157 , where @xmath146 and @xmath158 are momenta in each reaction .",
    "these are denoted @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath161-channels by a convention introduced by mandelstam . for massless gravitons , kinematics of the @xmath159- , @xmath161- and @xmath160- channels all",
    "meet at a point .",
    "however , if the graviton acquires an effective mass , it moves these three channels apart and changes the graviton - nucleon interaction .",
    "in particular , it affects the nucleon pole term in the @xmath160-channel , hence the structure of the nucleon . what is needed , but beyond reach at present , is to solve the schwinger - dyson equations for this case following the procedure of pennington and wilson for the @xmath162 system .",
    "the obstacle is that the structure of the nucleon is not yet known precisely enough for a realistic calculation from first principles .",
    "thomas developed a model in 1983 explaining features of deep inelastic scattering ( i.e. large momentum and energy transfers in electron scattering from nucleons ) which provided a qualitative explanation of the data in terms of a chiral quark model @xcite .",
    "the idea is that a nucleon has a component in its wave function with a pion circulating round it with one unit of orbital angular momentum : @xmath163_{l=1}$ ] .",
    "this has been followed up in a recent paper of burkhardt et al . which improves this work in specific ways @xcite , but the final set of parameters is not yet available .",
    "cosmology needs to be treated equally empirically .",
    "my suggestion is that dark energy is symptomatic of spontaneous symmetry breaking of gravitation to a de sitter universe governed by the space and time components of the metric .",
    "the de sitter universe has a lower symmetry than general relativity . in galaxies ,",
    "@xmath0 is the order parameter of a fermi - dirac condensate and is directly related to @xmath164 .",
    "the model proposed here is precise and open to experimental test .",
    "the most important and simplest is that if dark matter is replaced by this model , it is obviously necessary to redo the parametrisation of dark energy so that it reproduces smoothly what has been parametrised as dark matter up to now .",
    "this does not necessarily require major modifications .",
    "the main point is to fit the third peak in the cosmic microwave background .",
    "this requires cooperation of groups with the latest planck data and techniques at their finger - tips . despite the clues pointed out here that a fermi - dirac condensate explains galactic rotation curves",
    ", this could fail",
    ". it would not be surprising if minor modifications are required in the refit to dark energy and new clues might emerge .",
    "it is necessary to include the logarithmic tail of the newtonian potential found here .",
    "it is also essential to treat voids so that they only contribute to dark energy via the galaxies observed there .",
    "those may not be well resolved if they are very distant from us .",
    "it is also essential to fit the hubble parameter and magnitudes of type1a supernovae as a function of red - shift @xmath165 .",
    "whatever develops at the edges of galaxies will affect both strong and weak gravitational lensing .",
    "however , unless data are used where a distant quasar transmits light through the periphery of a galaxy , where the effect of @xmath39 is large , the lensing effect will be rather small .",
    "the weak logarithmic tail of newtonian gravitation also needs to be taken into account .",
    "what happens in clusters of galaxies needs detailed , laborious calculations using the formulae given here ; since there are presently claims that milgrom s formula does not correctly reproduce what happens in clusters , this could be revealing . a multi - body interaction between the hubble mechanism and several galaxies",
    "is required . quite apart from the attraction",
    "to acceleration @xmath0 , there are also strong tidal effects of the variety discussed by kroupa @xcite .",
    "the same remarks apply to the bullet cluster , which needs to be refitted with the model proposed here .",
    "the calculation becomes a two - centre problem .",
    "the hubble acceleration couples to both galaxies , but they also couple to one another , modifying the zero - point energy ; individual stars in galaxies communicate with one another not only through the newtonian potential but via their fermi functions . in the bullet cluster",
    ", each galaxy behaves in this way , but there will be coupling between stars `` belonging '' to each individual galaxy .",
    "there may be complex interactions between the two galaxies including resonance effects .",
    "there are new data on the bullet cluster @xcite showing that there are many dwarf satellite galaxies in the cluster .",
    "the equations given here allow very little freedom - just the @xmath70 perturbations allowed in the fermi function at the top and bottom of fig .",
    "there are five clues which point to galaxies and globular clusters being quantum mechanical condensates .    1 .   the phenomena of fig .",
    "1 appear on a logarithmic scale of @xmath5 .",
    "this is the form expected for the partition function of statistical mechanics : @xmath166 where @xmath167 are energies of levels in a box and @xmath168 denotes the numbers of quantum levels in the box . for a refresher course , see schr \" odinger s clear exposition @xcite .",
    "2 .   fig .",
    "1(a ) can be interpreted in terms of quantum mechanical mixing between two crossing eigenstates ; the rotation of axes accomodated by fig .",
    "3 is just what is expected from the bogoliubov - valatin transformation , a quantum effect .",
    "3 .   fig .",
    "1(c ) is fitted naturally by a fermi function with an energy gap @xmath27 .",
    "the asymptotic form of the acceleration in fig .",
    "1(a ) generates a logarithmic tail ; this requires a quantum mechanical explanation .",
    "a fermi - dirac condensate fits the data ; a bose - einstein condensate does not .",
    "long wave - length gravitons can explain the amplification of the amplitude forming the condensate .",
    "the lower branch of the breit - rabi equation has the opposite curvature to the upper one .",
    "the natural interpretation of this result is that it corresponds to an excited state which will decay rapidly and will not therefore appear in galactic rotation curves .",
    "the interpretation of the curve of fig .",
    "1(b ) as an energy - dependent breit - wigner pole is that the graviton acquires an effective mass in the vicinity of @xmath0 .",
    "how this originates is speculative but does not reflect on the five clues listed above ; it depends on the nucleon structure function which is not yet well defined .",
    "the asymptotic form of the acceleration is @xmath169 .",
    "this is clearly associated with the hubble acceleration and is related to dark energy .",
    "the standard approach to the universe is the friedmann - robertson - walker model where components of the metric are smoothed over local structures and appear in the radial and time components of the metric of general relativity .",
    "my suggestion is that galaxies create fine - structure and the friedmann - robertson - walker model should include into dark energy the sum over these structures .",
    "this may explain the agreement between @xmath0 and @xmath164 in our part of the universe as well as its late - time acceleration .",
    "those are the essential points .",
    "they do reflect successfully the facts which mond parametrises .",
    "however , only the peripheries of galaxies are considered .",
    "the morphology at the centres of galaxies is a separate issue .",
    "there are two further small comments .",
    "firstly , there have been many papers on the derivation of newton s law from entropic arguments .",
    "many assume that one can assign a temperature @xmath170 to the hubble acceleration and a temperature @xmath171 for the gravitational potential by adding them as the sum of squares , i.e. the random phase approximation .",
    "this gives the result for the total acceleration : @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the hubble acceleration @xmath174 , and @xmath18 is the distance to the centre of the gravitating object .",
    "this is a quite different approach to the one proposed here and leads to a very small effect . for the milky way ,",
    "it is a maximum of @xmath175 .",
    "secondly , iorio has calculated that effects of mond on the perihelia of planets in the solar system are about a factor 10 below present experimental errors @xcite .",
    "the logarithmic term arising from mond will be of order @xmath0 , which is very small and will vary exceedingly slowly over the solar system .",
    "it has been pointed out by galianni et al . that it may be feasible to detect the mond effect at acceleration @xmath0 in the solar system near lagrangian points where the accelerations of the sun , earth and moon cancel out @xcite .",
    "if measurements of sufficient accuracy could be made , they might confirm or modify mond as a model of the behaviour of galaxies ; secondly , they have the important potential to measure the shape of the response function through the region where the bend appears in fig .",
    "further study of globular clusters would also provide information on the rotation curves of galaxies .",
