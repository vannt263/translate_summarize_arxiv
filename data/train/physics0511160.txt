    "a great deal of information about particles in dispersion can be measured using the light scattering technique .",
    "one of the main applications of the light scattering technique is that measures the particle sizes .",
    "the static light scattering technique ( sls ) measures the size information from the optical characteristics and the dynamic light scattering technique ( dls ) obtains the size information from both the optical and hydrodynamic features of particles .    for a long time",
    ", the standard method of cumulants@xcite has been used to measure the apparent hydrodynamic radius @xmath2 of particles from the normalized time auto - correlation function of the scattered light intensity @xmath3 with the assistance of the einstein - stokes relation , where @xmath5 is the delay time .",
    "the equilibrium swelling ratios@xcite of @xmath6 at temperature @xmath4 over @xmath7 at temperature @xmath8 are used to show the volume phase transition . due to the fact that @xmath6 is determined by the optical , hydrodynamic characteristics and size distribution of particles and scattering vector@xcite , the equilibrium swelling ratios show the total changes of the optical , hydrodynamic characteristics and size distribution of particles as a function of temperature @xmath4 .",
    "the treatment of sls is simplified to the zimm plot , berry plot or guinier plot etc . to obtain the root mean - square radius of gyration @xmath9 and the molar mass of particles",
    "provided that the particle sizes are small@xcite . in order to obtain more information about the particles",
    ", people have explored the relationships among the physical quantities measured using the sls and dls techniques respectively .",
    "the measurements of the dimensionless shape parameter @xmath10 re8,re9,re10,re11,re12 have been extensively used to infer the structures of particles for a long time . in this judgement",
    ", it has an assumption that the particle sizes measured from sls and dls are the same .",
    "however , the particle sizes measured from sls and dls are different quantities@xcite . exactly using the light scattering technique ,",
    "three different sizes can be measured for dilute poly - disperse homogenous spherical particles in dispersion : one is a static radius @xmath0 measured from the optical characteristics ; the second is a hydrodynamic radius @xmath1 obtained from the hydrodynamic features and the third is an apparent hydrodynamic radius @xmath2 determined by the optical , hydrodynamic characteristics and size distribution of particles and scattering angle .    in this work , the three different particle sizes will be investigated using poly(@xmath11-isopropylacrylamide)(pnipam ) microgel samples with a simple assumption that hydrodynamic radius @xmath1 is in proportion to the static radius @xmath0 .",
    "the results show that the expected values of @xmath12 calculated based on the particle size information obtained using the static light technique are consistent with the experimental data , the difference between the mean static radius and apparent hydrodynamic radius is large and the difference between the mean hydrodynamic radius and apparent hydrodynamic radius is influenced by the particle size distribution .",
    "the volume phase transition is thus investigated using the equilibrium swelling ratios of static radii and apparent hydrodynamic radii respectively .",

    "the relationship between the static and hydrodynamic radii is assumed to be @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a constant . from the siegert relation between @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xcite    @xmath33",
    "the function between the static and dynamic light scattering is built and the values of @xmath3 can be expected based on the size information obtained using the sls technique .",

    "the particle size distribution is also becoming narrow when the @xmath42-methylenebisacrylamide content is increased in the vicinity of the phase transition temperature . from the theoretical analysis of cumulants",
    ", the apparent hydrodynamic radius is obtained from averaging the term @xmath44 in static particle size distribution @xmath20 with the weight @xmath45 , where @xmath46 represents the hydrodynamic features of particles . for the mono - disperse particle systems , since the effects of scattered intensity are cancelled , the apparent hydrodynamic radius is equal to the hydrodynamic radius . for poly - disperse particle systems ,",
