    "the c@xmath0h radical ( ethynyl ) is an intermediate of significant importance in the chemistry of hydrocarbon combustion , particularly in acetylene - air mixtures.@xcite it is also related to the substituted ethynyl species which are the crucial intermediates in the hydrogen abstraction - acetylene addition ( haca ) mechanism that leads to the formation of polyaromatic ring species on the way to soot in fuel rich environments .",
    "@xcite recently , a haca - like mechanism has also been invoked to explain the growth of single - walled carbon nanotubes in low temperature catalyzed - chemical vapor deposition syntheses using acetylene and inert gas flowing over mildly heated metal - containing catalysts . in this model ,",
    "the adsorbed c@xmath0h intermediate acts as a continuously regenerated `` catalyst '' in the process.@xcite    the radical was one of the earliest molecules identified in interstellar space via its microwave spectrum .",
    "@xcite models of interstellar chemistry@xcite invoke reaction pathways involving c@xmath0h to explain the presence of polyaromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) in the interstellar and star - formation regions in space .",
    "finally , investigations of the atmosphere of titan , a moon of saturn , have shown that photochemistry in its upper atmosphere leads to significant concentrations of polyynes , assumed to be produced in similar reaction sequences to those involved in the terrestrial formation of pahs and soot , and including ethynyl - like intermediates in a chain reaction synthetic pathway .",
    "@xcite in support of the extensive reaction network modeling in multiple environments , rate constants have been measured for reactions of ethynyl radicals with various partners over a range of temperatures .",
    "@xcite    following the astronomical observation of the ethynyl radical,@xcite the gas - phase microwave spectrum was recorded and the molecular structure determined in the 1980s.@xcite prior to this , laboratory observations had been limited to work in low temperature matrices.@xcite the infrared spectrum of the radical is complicated by the presence of a low - lying _ a _ @xmath3 excited electronic state which splits due to the renner - teller effect .",
    "the three resulting electronic surfaces are vibronically coupled , so the vibrationally excited levels of the ground _ x _ @xmath7 state all contain some @xmath8-state character .",
    "the curl@xcite group reported extensive work on the infrared spectrum in the 3@xmath9 m ( c - h stretching ) region and hirota@xcite recorded and analyzed the spectrum in the c - c stretching region and identified hot bands originating in the low frequency bending vibrational mode .",
    "all observed infrared spectra showed effects resulting from the strong vibronic interactions and local @xmath10-dependent perturbations due to background levels derived from combinations of lower frequency modes .",
    "many more spectroscopic studies were reported in subsequent years and pfelzer__et al.__@xcite survey the work up to the mid 1990 s .",
    "detailed understanding of the vibronic interactions leading to the observed spectra has relied upon _ ab initio _ methods to label the vibronic levels observed and to guide assignments , particularly at higher internal energies .",
    "peri _ _ et al.__@xcite made a state - of - the - art calculation of the vibronic states up to approximately 5000 @xmath2 in 1992 , and were able to identify the vibronic levels observed to that time .",
    "later , tarroni and carter@xcite reported more accurate calculations based on variational solutions of the nuclear motion on the coupled high level _ ab initio _ potential energy surfaces .",
    "importantly , the second of these papers reported absorption intensities to vibronically excited levels from the zero point level of the ground state thereby allowing vibronic state labels to be assigned to observed spectra with confidence in energy regions where the density of states is large .",
    "in low temperature matrices , forney _ _ et al.__@xcite had reported infrared spectra to much shorter wavelengths than previously seen , and hsu _ _ et al.__@xcite identified many higher lying vibronic states in laser - induced fluorescence ( lif ) spectra in the @xmath11 band system .",

    "additional bands of c@xmath0h in the 4250@xmath124550 @xmath2 region have very recently been analyzed in a fourier transform emission spectrum , and a band near 6340 @xmath2 has been characterized by diode laser spectroscopy in a concentration modulated discharge source.@xcite    both the calculations@xcite and matrix spectrum@xcite show that the most intense bands in the entire infrared and near - infrared spectra of the radical lie around 7100 @xmath2 or 1.4 @xmath9 m .",
    "the vibronic levels at this energy are strongly mixed , but derive much of their intensity from the near - vertical transition to the @xmath8 ( 0,0,2 ) state , in a region of spectrum where no gas phase spectra have yet been reported .",
    "we expect that the spectra in this wavelength region will be advantageous for kinetic or non - intrusive remote sensing applications .",
    "in addition to the strength of these near - infrared transitions , efficient spectroscopic sources and detectors are available at these wavelengths , and optical fibers are well suited for coupling probe radiation in and out of the sample . in this work ,",
    "we report measurements of the c@xmath0h spectrum between approximately 6630 and 7135 @xmath2 by diode laser transient absorption spectroscopy . we have identified and rotationally assigned three band systems in this region , based on ground state combination differences @xcite and comparison to the predictions of tarroni and carter.@xcite    in the course of our spectroscopic studies , we were initially puzzled to find that the decay rate of the vibronic ground state",
    "c@xmath0h radical signals was several times slower than expected , based on published room temperature rate constants @xcite for the reaction of c@xmath0h with our chosen photolytic precursor , cf@xmath13c@xmath6h , at the sample pressures we had chosen for convenient collection of radical spectra . a time - dependent spectral simplification observed in ar : cf@xmath13c@xmath6h mixtures that we attributed to vibrational thermalization was not observed in ar : c@xmath0h@xmath0 mixtures , where a dense set of both assigned and unassigned lines all decayed at comparable rates .",
    "the ground state radical lifetimes were also longer than anticipated in acetylene , based on published thermal rate constants and the sample composition . to investigate these effects further , we modified the detection system slightly for fixed frequency kinetic studies , and undertook some pressure and dilution studies , to see the effects of competitive reaction and relaxation on the time - dependent spectra .",
    "the kinetic observations and discussions are reported following the spectroscopic observations and analysis below .",
    "one important reason to characterize these strong bands of c@xmath0h in the 7000 @xmath2 region is for future use in kinetic investigations . in this preliminary study ,",
    "the complex interplay of hot formation , vibronic relaxation and energy - dependent reactivity is evident but far from fully characterized .",
    "useful comparisons can be made with previous spectroscopic work where conditions reported for observing spectra of different hot or cold - band transitions in c@xmath0h had been optimized .",
    "additional comparisons can be made with previous kinetic spectroscopy studies of c@xmath0h reactions , where either complete or negligible vibronic relaxation prior to reaction is a recognized precondition for the measurement of reliable thermal rate constants .",
    "hirota and co - workers @xcite had used 193 nm photolysis of a 2:3 mixture of c@xmath0h@xmath0:ar at 2 torr total pressure to search for c@xmath0h transitions in the 1850 @xmath2 region .",
    "they reported many lines , but none that could be assigned to cold bands of c@xmath0h , unless they replaced the ar with h@xmath0 , d@xmath0 , co or ch@xmath14 as a buffer gas .",
    "he and n@xmath0 were also reported to be ineffective at vibrational relaxation .",
    "these observations are hard to understand given current understanding of the kinetics .",
    "the acetylene pressure was high enough to make the estimated lifetime of c@xmath0h shorter than the microsecond detector response , and adding hydrogen would seemingly only decrease the lifetime by means of an additional reactive loss channel.@xcite clear spectroscopic evidence of the @xmath15 fundamental of c@xmath0h was nevertheless obtained .",
    "hsu et al.@xcite used pump - probe delay time - dependent lif intensities to help assign a selection of bands originating in various vibrationally excited states of c@xmath0h ( @xmath16 ) . they reported successively longer lifetimes for lower energy states , but no resolved growth kinetics for any bands , following 193 nm excitation of c@xmath0h@xmath0/h@xmath0 mixtures . in a subsequent report,@xcite the substitution of sf@xmath17 for ar , he , or h@xmath0 in the c@xmath0h@xmath0 photolysis sample was found to increase the relative intensity of otherwise weak lif bands originating in low bending levels of c@xmath0h , consistent with enhanced vibrational relaxation by sf@xmath17 .",

    "the vibronic relaxation appears to be slower than has often been claimed .",
    "the transient absorption spectra were recorded using a spectrometer very similar to that described previously .",
    "@xcite ethynyl radicals were formed by 193 nm arf excimer laser photolysis of a sample of cf@xmath19c@xmath20h ( trifluoromethyl acetylene , or 3,3,3 trifluoropropyne ) obtained from synquest laboratories , diluted in argon .",
    "a sacher laserteknik tunable diode laser , model tec 500 , with output centered at 1450 nm was the spectroscopic source .",
    "one portion of the laser power was sent to a wavemeter ( burleigh wa-1500 ) , and another portion was used as a reference beam for active noise reduction .",
    "the main beam was directed through a herriott - type absorption cell with 35 passes between mirrors separated by 2 meters .",
    "signal and reference beams were imaged onto an _ a.c._-coupled dual ingaas photoreceiver ( new focus 1617 ) . the excimer laser beam , with typical pulse energies of 30 mj in a 3 @xmath21 beam , passed through the center of the absorption cell and overlapped the probe beam in the central portion of the cell .",
    "we estimate the effective absorption path length through the photolysis volume was about 25 meters .",
    "mixtures of ar and cf@xmath19c@xmath20h in a 1:1 ratio were prepared in a large storage flask at pressures of approximately one atmosphere .",
    "this gas mixture flowed slowly at 5 sccm though the cell .",
    "total pressures used for the spectral scans were typically 1 torr .",
    "mixtures of acetylene in ar were also used for comparison in some spectral regions , producing similar but weaker spectra with generally faster decay rates .",
    "because of the stronger and longer - lasting signals , the systematic spectroscopy scans were carried out with the cf@xmath18c@xmath20h precursor .",
    "some additional exploratory measurements of the relaxation and reaction kinetics were made at fixed probe frequencies on selected ground state ethynyl radical transitions , as a function of precursor and inert buffer gas ( argon ) concentrations .",
    "these measurements used a _",
    "d.c._-coupled balanced photoreceiver ( new focus 1817 ) , with sequential measurement and off - line subtraction of on- and off - resonant signals to remove the reproducible background associated with acoustic transients and increase the fidelity of the transient signals .",
    "tests with varying flow rates or a reduction of the excimer repetition rate below its typical value of 10 hz showed no sign of secondary photolysis or sample depletion .",
    "initial spectroscopic searches for the strong bands observed in the low temperature matrix spectrum @xcite and predicted by tarroni and carter@xcite were carried out by photolysis of a slowly flowing sample of cf@xmath18c@xmath20h in ar at 193 nm .",
    "transient absorption bands presumed to be due to c@xmath20h were detected throughout the search region .",
    "further support for the attribution of absorption lines to c@xmath20h was obtained by observing some of the same lines in spectra using c@xmath20h@xmath20 as the photolytic precursor .",
    "spectra recorded immediately following the photolysis pulse were much more complicated than spectra at longer delay times , which we attribute to collisional cooling of an initially formed hot distribution .",
    "the time development of signals in samples containing c@xmath6h@xmath6 was quite different to that observed with cf@xmath18c@xmath20h , as might be expected due to differences in absorption cross section , quantum yields for c@xmath6h , the initial state distributions , relaxation kinetics , and rates of reaction with the precursors .",
    "some further kinetic investigations are presented below , but for the purposes of the spectroscopic studies , cf@xmath18c@xmath20h was found to provide larger signals and simpler spectra after partial relaxation , when compared to c@xmath22h@xmath6 samples .",
    "therefore , all of the subsequent spectroscopic measurements were made using cf@xmath18c@xmath20h precursor in ar .",
    "examples of a section of the observed spectra near 7125 @xmath2 at short and long time delays with the cf@xmath18c@xmath20h precursor are shown in figure [ figure1 . ] .",
    "this spectrum was obtained by averaging 40 photolysis laser shots per wavelength step ( typically 0.005 @xmath2 ) in a 1:1 mixture of cf@xmath18c@xmath20h and argon at a total pressure of 1.0 torr .",

    "previously , there have been no reported gas phase measurements of c@xmath6h in the 6700 @xmath40 and 7100 @xmath58 regions studied here .",
    "however , the origins determined for all three bands identified and assigned are in good agreement with the calculated values from tarroni et al .",
    "@xcite compared to the earlier matrix work,@xcite a new @xmath26 band was identified and assigned to the transition from the ground state to the x(0,8@xmath79,2 ) state again based on tarroni and carter.@xcite this state has a very small fraction of @xmath80 electronic state mixing , and was assigned to the vibrational combination level of @xmath81 state .",
    "the standard deviation for the fit of this band is smaller than the other two observed bands in this region , possibly reflecting its less mixed character .",
    "we estimate the overall intensity ratio between the three bands at 6696 , 7088 and 7110 @xmath2 is about 1:4:2 , respectively , which is in good agreement with the calculated intensity ratios.@xcite    neglecting small nuclear hyperfine coupling effects , the observed discrete @xmath10-dependent perturbations require perturbing levels of the same @xmath10 and parity to lie nearby in energy . by examining plots ( figure [ figure7 . ] ) of observed@xmath12calculated energies against @xmath82 , for the upper @xmath1 state of the band at 7088 @xmath2 , local perturbations at @xmath83 ( @xmath12 parity ) , @xmath84 ( + parity ) , and for all @xmath10 associated with @xmath85 can be seen .",
    "for the first two levels , only one @xmath10-component of a given @xmath30 is perturbed , implying that the perturbing level must belong to a state where the parity does not@xcite alternate with @xmath30 , _",
    "i.e. _ probably a nearby @xmath86 state . however , the observed @xmath87 state at 7110 @xmath2 is _ not _ the perturber because @xmath83 ( @xmath88 parity ) of the @xmath1 state is pushed down by a state that has @xmath83 at higher energy , while the @xmath83 ( @xmath12 parity ) of the 7110 @xmath2 @xmath87 state has a lower energy , by approximately 0.5 @xmath2 , as shown in figure [ figure8 . ] .",
    "the observed @xmath3 state level in question is also perturbed and pushed down in energy , as can be seen in table iii .",
    "similarly , @xmath89 of the @xmath1 state lies well below the energy of the corresponding level in the @xmath3 state which therefore can not cause the observed @xmath1 perturbation either .",
    "we conclude the perturbing level is a spectroscopically dark state .",
    "supplementary data available@xcite for the published calculations list all @xmath67 and @xmath3 levels up to 10 000 @xmath2 in energy , but there is no other state which could plausibly lead to the low - j perturbations , implying it is actually a @xmath90 or higher angular momentum state .    above @xmath91 ,",
    "the 7088 @xmath2 @xmath1 state suffers a much larger perturbation as can be seen in figure [ figure7 . ] .",
    "this perturbation affects both @xmath92 and @xmath12 parity levels equally so is qualitatively different to that seen for the two lower rotational levels .",
    "however , at these @xmath10-values , all c@xmath0h states will be close to case(b ) , and so the arguments used to infer the character of the perturber above can not be applied .",
    "the @xmath93 level is calculated@xcite to lie some 40 @xmath2 below the 7088 @xmath2 experimental level , and this could plausibly be the source of the observed high-@xmath10 perturbations in 7088 @xmath2 band .",
    "the @xmath25 band at 7110 @xmath2 shows strong @xmath94 branches and much weaker _ p _ branches .",
    "for example at the position of @xmath95(12.5 ) and @xmath96(11.5 ) , the observed spectroscopic features are barely above the noise .",
    "this unusual intensity pattern is not unknown for vibronic transitions involving @xmath97 and @xmath1 states@xcite and occurs when @xmath981 perturbations are present .",
    "the @xmath99 branch intensity pattern for transitions terminating in the mixed level can be very complex .",
    "however , the @xmath981 perturbation always affects the intensity of @xmath100 = + 1 ( @xmath101-branch ) and @xmath881(@xmath102-branch ) in the opposite direction .",
    "if the perturbation is strong , a whole branch ( e.g @xmath101-branch ) can be missing while the other ( e.g. @xmath102-branch ) gets much higher intensity as was observed in nco by dixon @xcite .",
    "the numerous additional lines observed in the prompt spectrum of the recorded region are likely hot bands of c@xmath0h . from the generally reliable excited vibronic energies calculated by tarroni and carter@xcite and experimental rotational constants for many low - lying excited levels",
    ", we may hope to identify some of these additional bands using combination differences , although we have so far been unsuccessful in this attempt .",
    "clearly , the kinetic analysis of vibronic relaxation would be more compelling with secure spectral assignments .      because many free radicals are formed with substantial internal energy , and undergo rapid reactions that can compete with relaxation , there is recent interest in improving theoretical treatments of non - thermal effects in combustion @xcite and atmospheric chemistry .",
    "@xcite energetic radicals or adducts may react completely , prior to the establishment of any local thermodynamic equilibrium of internal states , under conditions when the reaction rates and even branching ratios may be rapidly changing with internal energy .",
    "the case of c@xmath6h may be a good place to investigate the behavior at intermediate pressures of inert colliders , where the competition between relaxation and reaction can be tuned and observed , rather than deliberately suppressed .",
    "the vibronic mixing of the _ a _ @xmath3 and _ x _ @xmath1 states in c@xmath6h can make the energy dependent reactivity more complex than in other radicals with a simpler electronic structure .    the time dependence of ground state absorption signals for a photolytically generated hot radical like c@xmath0h will depend on the initial state distribution , the vibronic relaxation cascade due to energy transfer collisions with both inert and unsuccessfully reactive collision partners , as well as the reactive loss of the radicals in their evolving , nonthermal energy distribution .",
    "the energy dependence of the reaction rate plays a well - known and central role in the conventionally measured temperature - dependent rate constants of thermalized radicals .",
    "the energy transfer characteristics are typically less easily measured under the high energy conditions relevant to chemical activation or photodissociation .",
    "it is , however , frequently possible to devise conditions when the subtle details of the energy transfer are unimportant , and internal energy relaxation eigenvalues are well separated from the chemically significant eigenvalues of the master equation that describes the coupled reaction and relaxation processes .",
    "@xcite    previous studies have shown dramatically increased reactivity of unrelaxed @xcite and partially relaxed @xcite c@xmath0h radicals from the photodissociation of acetylene in collisions with h@xmath20 , for example .",
    "the thermal rate constant for this reaction near room temperature is 5.7 @xmath61 10@xmath103 @xmath104 molec@xmath76 sec@xmath76 , increasing sharply with temperature , following nonlinear arrhenius behavior.@xcite it may be important to distinguish between the temperature dependence of the thermal rate constant and the variable reactivity of internally excited states of the radical .",
    "theoretical calculations@xcite of possible vibrational mode - specific effects in this reaction and its reverse do not find vibrational enhancement of the reaction with stretching excitation of c@xmath0h and even find an inhibition with bending excitation .",
    "the potential energy surface@xcite used for the full - dimensional dynamics calculations@xcite does not , however , include the low energy _ a _ state , which has a barrierless path to h + c@xmath0h@xmath0 , according to the calculations of peeters et al.@xcite    the low energy _",
    "a _ @xmath3 state of c@xmath0h may contribute further complexity to an energy - dependent reactivity , as transition states and barriers to reactions may be quite different for _ a _ and _ x _ state interactions .",
    "the vibronic mixing of _ a _ and _ x _ states is strong enough , however , that they may not be kinetically distinct species , but rather an energy - dependent mixture , with a correspondingly mixed reactivity .",
    "@xcite even the lowest vibrationally excited states nominally belonging to the _ x _ @xmath7 state of c@xmath0h are calculated to have about 0.05 @xmath8-state character , and the zero - order vibrationless level of the @xmath8 state is quite evenly fragmented among five vibronic levels with energies between 3604 and 4593 @xmath2 , none of which have more than 40% @xmath8 state character.@xcite    in contrast to the reaction with hydrogen , the thermal rate constant for the reaction of c@xmath0h with acetylene is much faster : 1.3 @xmath61 10@xmath74 @xmath75 molec@xmath76 s@xmath76 near 300 k , with little temperature dependence , as reviewed by van look and peeters.@xcite the trends in transient ground state population illustrated in figure [ figure5 . ] and even more so in figure [ figure4 . ] for cf@xmath18c@xmath0h suggest that slowing down the relaxation of the hot radicals at lower buffer pressure inhibits the reactive loss .",
    "such behavior can be expected for a barrierless association followed by a submerged barrier to fragmentation.@xcite    a comparison of the transient spectra of hot and cold band lines following c@xmath0h@xmath0 photodissociation similar to our figure [ figure6 .",
    "] was reported by yan , et al.@xcite this work has been widely cited @xcite as evidence that in the presence of  20 torr he , the vibrational thermalization of c@xmath0h will be complete in less than a microsecond . without fully reproducing the conditions of yan al . @xcite we can not be certain , but it appears likely that in the 3.5% mixture of acetylene and he used for this measurement , the disappearance rate of vibrationally excited c@xmath0h is dominated by reaction with c@xmath0h@xmath0 rather than vibrational relaxation by he . at the lower acetylene pressures typically used in subsequent kinetic experiments , the reactive loss is suppressed and vibrational excitation can be expected to persist to longer times .",
    "sf@xmath17 has often also been added to test gas mixtures to accelerate vibrational relaxation , although several workers have reported that it was found to have no effect on ground state kinetic spectroscopy of c@xmath0h and was therefore left out.@xcite until future experiments are able to provide a direct monitor of the vibrational relaxation , we can only echo a summary statement from laufer and fahr @xcite in their 2004 review of the reactions and kinetics of ethynyl radicals from acetylene photodissociation :  the role of vibrational excitation in the subsequent chemistry is not clear . \"    as the computational machinery for _ ab initio _ kinetics becomes more robust and well tested , the ambition grows to improve the treatment of chemical activation problems , including multiwell branching in competition with relaxation.@xcite coupled electronic states add to the challenge .",
    "particularly for fast radical reactions that may react to completion faster than thermalization , a collection of thermal rate constants may not be sufficient to characterize a mechanism .",
    "an extended set of state - resolved c@xmath0h kinetic measurements could provide a challenging target for the development of next - generation master - equation - based kinetic models .",
    "the newly identified strong near - infrared bands can facilitate these measurements .",
    "three new near - infrared bands of c@xmath0h have been observed and analyzed in the gas phase by diode laser spectroscopy .",
    "transitions centered at 7110 , 7088 , and 6696 @xmath2 were found to be in good agreement with the calculated energies of vibronic levels of mixed @xmath4 and @xmath5 electronic character.@xcite the transitions are among the strongest of all those in the infrared and near infrared spectrum of the radical and provide a convenient spectroscopic tool for monitoring concentrations of the ground state radical in chemical mixtures .",
    "kinetic measurements show that the competition between reactive loss and vibrational relaxation of the initially hot radicals makes interpretation of the kinetic signals complicated , especially because of the presence of the low - lying excited electronic state which has different reactivity and whose wavefunction contaminates all vibrationally excited levels of the ground electronic state .",
    "these attributes combine to make c@xmath0h a particularly attractive vehicle for studying the effects of the presence of multiple potential surfaces on collisional processes in small free radicals where accurate calculations are now possible .",

    "<S> transient diode laser absorption spectroscopy has been used to measure three strong vibronic bands in the near infrared spectrum of the c@xmath0h , ethynyl , radical not previously observed in the gas phase . </S>",
    "<S> the radical was produced by ultraviolet excimer laser photolysis of either acetylene or ( 1,1,1)-trifluoropropyne in a slowly flowing sample of the precursor diluted in inert gas , and the spectral resolution was doppler - limited . </S>",
    "<S> the character of the upper states was determined from the rotational and fine structure in the observed spectra and assigned by measurement of ground state rotational combination differences . </S>",
    "<S> the upper states include a @xmath1 state at 6696 @xmath2 , a second @xmath1 state at 7088 @xmath2 , and a @xmath3 state at 7110 @xmath2 . by comparison with published calculations ( r. tarroni and s. carter , _ j. chem </S>",
    "<S> . phys _ * 119 * , 12878 ( 2003 ) and _ mol . phys_. * 102 * , 2167 ( 2004 ) ) , the vibronic character of these levels was also assigned . </S>",
    "<S> the observed states contain both @xmath4 and @xmath5 electronic character . </S>",
    "<S> several local rotational level perturbations were observed in the excited states . </S>",
    "<S> kinetic measurements of the time - evolution of the ground state populations following collisional relaxation and reactive loss of the radicals formed in a hot , non - thermal , population distribution were made using some of the strong rotational lines observed . </S>",
    "<S> the case of c@xmath6h may be a good place to investigate the behavior at intermediate pressures of inert colliders , where the competition between relaxation and reaction can be tuned and observed to compare with master equation models , rather than deliberately suppressed to measure thermal rate constants . </S>"
