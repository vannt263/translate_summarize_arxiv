    "a muon component of cosmic rays plays an important role in many fields of astroparticle physics .",
    "it provides a basis for verification of our knowledge on primary cosmic ray ( pcr ) spectrum behaviour , high - energy hadronic interactions and for solution of neutrino physics problems . in view of this",
    ", a question of interconsistency of information , gained in the last two decades on primary and muon fluxes , and on high - energy hadronic interactions presents great importance . in well known works of volkova et al .",
    "( 1979 )  @xcite , dar ( 1983 )  @xcite , butkevich et al .",
    "( 1989 )  @xcite , lipari ( 1993 )  @xcite , honda et al .",
    "( 1995 )  @xcite , agrawal et al .",
    "( 1996 )  @xcite and bugaev et al .",
    "( 1998 )  @xcite this problem was outside of the consideration , since the principal aim lied in the estimation of the secondary lepton fluxes .",
    "authors relied on the information on primaries and nuclear interactions , that was available at the papers writing time .",
    "certainly , these data were incomplete and ambiguous , as the consequence the inputs in the calculations also vary rather significantly .",
    "nevertheless , the outputs , i.e. muon fluxes , satisfactory agree with each other ( see comparisons in  @xcite ) and muon experimental data .",
    "the given circumstance with necessity shows , that discrepancies in the used pcr spectra in the large part were compensated by different approaches to the treatment of nuclear cascades .",
    "this , in turn , may possibly relate to the fact , that muon flux in most of these works served only for normalization of neutrino fluxes and it was fitted to the muon experimental data via adjustment of not precisely known parameters of hadronic interactions . from these short remarks it is clear , that all these calculations lack some standardization , as it was recently proposed by gaisser and honda  @xcite in respect to the pcr spectra .",
    "the current situation provides significantly better capabilities for adequate choice of pcr model and for simulation of nuclear cascades , and in this paper we have tried to take the maximum advantage of this .",
    "but , as our analysis has shown , unfortunately the information on all components of calculations is still very uncertain to provide a firm ground for accurate derivation of muon flux at sea level and , today , it is following ` from top to bottom ' .",
    "direct measurements of primary cosmic ray spectra span up to the energy of @xmath21  pev for protons and up to few hundred tev / n for other groups of nuclei .",
    "most abundant data are collected for @xmath3  tev / n . here proton spectrum is studied in series of recent satellite and balloon experiments with approximately 20% accuracy .",
    "higher energy data of sokol  @xcite , mubee  @xcite , jacee  @xcite and runjob  @xcite although have relatively large statistic and systematic errors , also satisfactory agree with each other . at the same time , the measurements of the helium spectrum are much less concordant and still differ by almost a factor of 2 for all energies , and this uncertainty is especially crucial for evaluation of @xmath4 and @xmath5 ratios .",
    "as it is widely known , protons and helium nuclei contribute @xmath6 to the nucleon flux at the top of the atmosphere , which is relevant for derivation of the muon spectrum at sea level , thus the particular emphasis should be given to the accurate description of these spectra .",
    "to avoid simplification , for the simulation of nuclear cascades we have applied widely approved and thoroughly tested monte - carlo code corsika  @xcite , that allows to treat hadronic interactions with the use of any of the up - to - date interaction models : qgsjet  @xcite , venus  @xcite , hdpm  @xcite , nexus  @xcite or dpmjet  @xcite .",
    "overall uncertainty , brought in computations of muon flux by the use of these models , is not very significant and considerably decreased in the last decade .",
    "so , the difference in @xmath7 inelastic cross - sections ` between the models have shrunk from 80  mb to today 20  mb in the region of few pev '  @xcite .",
    "average numbers of muons in cascades from primary protons , obtained with the use of these models , differ not more than by 20%  @xcite for all energies of interest .",
    "this means , that integral and differential muon fluxes at sea level will also differ by a close value , and this discrepancy is the smallest , in comparison with the uncertainties of pcr chemical composition and energy spectra for @xmath8  tev / n , and the sea level muon data .",
    "the latter , for @xmath9  gev , are both numerous and , on the whole , quite ambiguous ( see extensive summary in  @xcite ) , but the most recent ones of bess  @xcite and caprice  @xcite are very precise and closely agree with each other .",
    "they give a basis for checking information on primary light nuclei spectra up to the energies @xmath10  gev / n .",
    "the interval of higher muon energies @xmath11  gev , where the spread of the data on muon intensity is still small and amounts to some 20% , allows to examine with nearly the same accuracy behaviour of primary proton and helium spectra for the energies , extending to the upper bound of balloon and satellite measurements @xmath12  pev / n . evidently , that beyond the pcr data , it is not feasible to perform reliable calculations of the muon spectrum .",
    "what is more , the inverse problem , i.e. reconstruction of pcr fluxes from the data on muon spectrum , can not be also solved , because for @xmath13  tev there are only indirect data , in which muon flux at sea level is derived from results of underground measurements .",
    "these data are quite contradictory and have large systematic errors , mainly caused by incomplete information on rock properties and vagueness in question of prompt muon generation mechanisms ( see , for example , @xcite ) . as a consequence of all this",
    ", now there is no possibility to make conclusions neither on the preferability of any model of charm generation , nor on behaviour of pcr spectra for @xmath14  pev / n .",
    "as it is stated above , this paper is devoted to the investigation of compatibility of the present sea level muon flux measurements in energy interval @xmath15  gev with the experimental data on pcr spectra for corresponding primary energies @xmath16  gev / n . in section  2 we briefly review the present data on primaries of h , he , cno , ne - si and fe groups and discuss pcr models , applied in this paper and in the papers of the other authors .",
    "basic characteristics of computations are presented in section  3",
    ". section  4 is devoted to consideration of consistency of our vertical muon flux , derived from the data of direct pcr measurements , with sea level muon experiments in the energy range @xmath15  gev . since in this section",
    "we have revealed a sizable shortage of muons with energies , corresponding to that of primaries , studied with the emulsion chambers , in section  5 we examine possible effects , that may lead to a distortion of the information , obtained in the space and balloon experiments , employing this technique .",
    "our conclusions are given in section  6 .",
    "the extensive compilation of the modern data of space and balloon measurements plotted vs kinetic energy @xmath17  gev / n is shown in figures  [ p]-[hefe ] .",
    "the most of the data are gathered for relatively low energies @xmath18  tev / n .",
    "but even here some 15 years ago the spread in experimental results was at least 100% for all groups of nuclei . in spite of series of experiments , performed since then ,",
    "significant improvement was achieved only in the study of the proton spectrum .",
    "so , for energies from @xmath210 gev , where effects of geomagnetic cutoff and solar modulations become negligible , to some hundred gev , data of recent experiments leap  @xcite , caprice  @xcite , imax  @xcite , bess  @xcite and ams  @xcite are consistent within 20% ( see figure  [ p ] ) .",
    "better mutually consistent , within 510% , data of ams and bess , now are considered as the most precise . from @xmath2  200",
    "gev to @xmath19  tev there is a gap between magnet spectrometer and emulsion chamber experimental data , with the only ionization calorimeter measurements of ryan et al .  @xcite . since at the energies , overlapping with ams and bess , the given data overestimate proton intensity ( but not for helium ) , probably they should be lowered by 25% , as proposed in  @xcite . in any case ,",
    "more accurate information on behaviour of the proton spectrum in this energy interval is required for reliable evaluation of the muon and neutrino fluxes for the energies below 300  gev . from approximately 2  tev to @xmath20",
    "tev sokol , mubee , jacee and runjob measurements provide rather consistent information on proton flux , though with the nearly 20% uncertainty . for understanding of the proton spectrum behaviour beyond the ` knee ' ,",
    "valuable information is provided by the pioneer measurements of the tibet hybrid experiment  @xcite , carried out at the mountain altitude .",
    "these first results point at the steepening of the proton spectrum for @xmath21  tev and this is an essential guideline for the extrapolation of the direct measurements .",
    "spread in the data for all heavier nuclei practically for all energies of interest is much larger than that for hydrogen , and equals to 100% and more .",
    "the difference between the helium spectra of sokol , jacee and runjob is of major importance for accurate evaluation of secondary lepton fluxes .",
    ".,title=\"fig:\"].,title=\"fig : \" ]    .,title=\"fig:\"].,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ]        from the aforesaid it becomes evident , that today no unique fit of all data on primary spectra can be given and considerable arbitrariness in the choice of them still remains .",
    "in such events one may use , for example , upper and lower estimates of all primary fluxes , or the flux , giving some average of the experimental data .",
    "the principal model of the pcr spectrum , employed in our calculations , may be regarded just as the latter case .",
    "it was obtained in frameworks of anomalous diffusion of cosmic rays in fractal interstellar medium  @xcite , but here it is considered irrespectively to its validity for description of cosmic ray propagation . altogether in our computations we have accounted for 5 groups of primaries : h , he , cno , ne - si and fe .",
    "mass composition of the applied model is fitted to the direct and eas experimental data on the all - particle primary spectrum ( figure  [ allp ] ) . as it it seen from figures  [ p]-[hefe ] our model as well satisfactory corresponds to the available experimental information on elemental spectra and for high energies",
    "really gives some average of the data on nuclei , except that for hydrogen it presents rather an upper estimate .",
    "for calculation of muon flux it also matters , that the data on the proton component become insufficiently statistically provided from @xmath22  gev , and that sizeable uncertainty gives @xmath23% spread of the data on helium of jacee and runjob around the values , adopted in our model .",
    "so , though on the whole the situation looks quite well - defined for calculations of vertical muon intensity up to the energies of several tev , for the greater energies the existing pcr data are very ambiguous . in order to estimate the influence of these data spread on the resulting muon flux",
    ", we have additionally performed calculations with the use of another two pcr models , shown in figures  [ p]-[hefe ] : first of them presents the jacee fit of their hydrogen and helium measurements  @xcite , and the second is the model , suggested by gaisser and honda  @xcite .    to compute sea level muon flux",
    "we have converted primary nuclei spectra to a spectrum in nucleons in standard manner : @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the differential energy spectrum of the nuclei with atomic number @xmath26 , @xmath27 . in figure  [ nucleons ] it is presented , along with our primary nucleon flux ( solid line ) , fluxes , applied in calculations of muon intensity in works  @xcite .",
    "these pcr spectra vary both in shapes and values and here it is useful to discuss all of them in order to realize , how they correspond to the modern experimental data .",
    "first of all , one can see that a sizable discrepancy between our , ` gaisser and honda ' and ` jacee fit + 10% ' ( here we add 10% to account a contribution of heavier , than h and he , nuclei ) prevails , and this is a good illustration of the difficulties in the attaining of the unique description of the current experimental data .",
    "behaviour of our model requires some more comments .",
    "enhancement by @xmath28 of intensity of the proton component in the energy range @xmath29  gev is dictated by the fact , that our first test calculations of muon flux with the ` average ' , close to jacee fit , proton flux resulted in a very large shortage of muons at sea level ( see section  4 ) . in order to smooth this contradiction",
    "we have tested several variants of pcr spectra and eventually adopted the presented version .",
    "it gives the maximal increase of the nucleon flux , provided the elemental and all - particle spectra stay consistent with the experiment .",
    "note , that if the muon data did not force us to enlarge the hydrogen flux , then it would reasonably agree with the new data of the tibet as@xmath30 collaboration  @xcite .",
    "dip of our nucleon and elemental fluxes for @xmath31  gev / n is an intrinsic feature of the anomalous diffusion propagation model , and , on the other hand , it corresponds to the numerous indications about the change of the pcr spectral index in the ` knee ' region .        from the earlier works ,",
    "the most appropriate pcr models were employed by lipari  @xcite and agrawal et  al .",
    "the nucleon spectrum from the latter paper almost coincides with our one , deviating only from the energy of about @xmath32  gev .",
    "mainly , this discrepancy is caused by the use of excessive , in comparison with today s , flux of protons , obtained from the results of the first 8 jacee flights  @xcite . in 1993 jacee",
    "reported , that proton spectrum consists of two parts with different slopes and a spectral break at @xmath33  tev . in paper  @xcite this break",
    "was not accounted for and extrapolation of the data for @xmath34  tev was applied for the higher energies . in work of lipari",
    "a simple power primary nucleon spectrum was picked , which is convenient to use in analytic calculations , and no collation with the experiment was presented .",
    "nevertheless , this is a rather appropriate model , closely agreeing with the ` gaisser and honda ' fit .",
    "the three remaining spectra , applied by volkova et al .",
    "@xcite , honda et al .",
    "@xcite and bugaev et al .",
    "@xcite are quite excessive , compared to what is known today . in the oldest of the discussed work of volkova et al .",
    "@xcite , it is applied very large all - nucleon spectrum @xmath35 @xmath36 , obtained from eas data , and no elemental composition had been considered .",
    "spectrum , used by bugaev et al .",
    "@xcite , is taken from the work of nikolsky  @xcite , where it was derived from the analysis of fluctuations of muon and electron numbers in eas . for @xmath37  gev proton intensity in this model is essentially overestimated ( as a consequence , nucleon spectrum too ) , in comparison with the experimental data , and precisely such behaviour provides a good agreement of the resulting muon flux in  @xcite with the most of experimental data on sea level muon intensity . in the paper of honda",
    "et al .  @xcite the proton flux for all energies is also rather high for the following reasons . in the low energy region",
    "the given spectrum relies on the compilation of webber and lezniak  @xcite , i.e. mostly on the ryan et al .",
    "@xcite data .",
    "but they are referred in  @xcite incorrectly and do not match the original values , overstating them by @xmath28 .",
    "extrapolation of this spectrum to the higher energies reasonably agree with the jacee  @xmath38 flights results , but , as it was already said , to some extent overvalues the present data .",
    "from the analysis of these three last models a simple deduction follows : their renormalization down to the experimental values should cause a sizable deficit of calculated sea level muons .",
    "we shall return to this statement again in section  4 .",
    "simulation of cascade processes in the atmosphere has been performed with the use of corsika ( v6.00 , v6.018 ) . in",
    "most of calculations as the model describing hadron - nucleus interaction for energies @xmath39  gev qgsjet model is applied .",

    "validity of such approach for calculation of number of secondaries in eas at sea level is widely known ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) , however , for verification , we have made our own computations of muon numbers in cascades , initiated by primary protons , carbon and iron nuclei , for energies @xmath44 and @xmath45  ev /",

    "results are presented in figure  [ superp ] .",
    "as it is seen , the agreement between numbers of muons in cascades , simulated with realistic nuclei fragmentation and those , obtained in the frameworks of superposition models is excellent .",
    "this , as well , allows not to make a distinction between showers , initiated by protons and neutrons , and further by nucleons we mean protons . in figure  [ depos ]",
    "the relative contribution of all nuclei groups , according to our pcr mass composition , to the integral muon flux at sea level is shown .",
    "since the contribution of he nuclei amounts to @xmath28 throughout the entire energy range , thus mentioned in the previous section @xmath46 spread of experimental results on helium flux around values , taken in our model , brings approximately @xmath47 uncertainty to muon flux at sea level . from this point of view , the uncertainty due to ambiguity of the experimental situation for heavier nuclei is insignificant .    to obtain easily the muon spectrum for any model of the primary spectrum ,",
    "it is appropriate to perform calculations of integral muon flux in the following way : @xmath48 here @xmath49 is an average number of muons with energy @xmath50 in shower from primary nucleon with energy @xmath51 , @xmath52    differential primary spectrum converted to spectrum in nucleons , @xmath53    energy , which provides the calculation accuracy @xmath54 .",

    ", our computations do not contain methodical errors , and total statistical + interpolation + integration error is less , than 5% . from figure  [ int ] it",
    "is also seen , that the maximal difference @xmath73 in predictions of the qgsjet and venus hadronic interaction models is also practically out of significance in this situation . since the venus model was initially chosen by us as the model , providing one of the largest muon numbers in shower ( see @xcite ) , hence 10% should be regarded as the utmost possible increase of muon intensity for any interaction model in comparison with the qgsjet .    in this connection the results of the earlier works , not indicating any problems with the description of the muon data , deserve some closer consideration .",
    "we analyze here five works  @xcite .",
    "the collation of the pcr spectra with the experimental data , performed in section  2 , allows to split these papers into 2 groups : papers with excessive  @xcite and appropriate  @xcite fluxes . in order to reveal differences in hadronic interactions and calculation technique ,",

    "muon production in the papers with appropriate primary fluxes is @xmath74 higher , than obtained by us , and this difference is sufficient to mask the muon shortage . besides , pcr flux from the work  @xcite becomes excessive from @xmath75  tev , as we have already pointed in section  2",
    ". the data in respect of muon production of the latter two papers closely agree , apparently because in both of these works essentially the same authors participated . in @xcite also an explanation of relatively large muon yield may be found . in this calculations , for simulation of hadronic interactions",
    "target code had been applied , but with the enhancement of pion and kaon production .",
    "this resulted in increase of contribution of kaon decays to muon flux with @xmath76  tev up to a very large value of 50% .",
    "of course , uncertainties in description of hadronic interaction prevail , but , as our calculations show , discrepancies in muon yield at sea level between the widely recognized and extensively tested models , included in corsika , are at the level of @xmath47 .",
    "these models are evidently free from many drawbacks , peculiar to the models from the discussed works , and more thoroughly developed .",
    "hence , likely the largest part of the discrepancy should be attributed to underestimation of primary nucleon flux , but not to the incorrectness of the simulation of the nuclear cascades in the atmosphere .",
    "there is no need to repeat arguments from section  2 in favour of adequacy our pcr model , since it may be regarded just as a valid representation of the current experimental situation .",
    "we should only repeat , that our proton spectrum does not present a fit of the experimental data for @xmath77  gev , but even on @xmath220% overestimates them .",
    "this was done to smooth the discussed problem .",
    "if directly input in calculations fits of primary h and he spectra , obtained by jacee , with addition of 10% contribution of heavier nuclei , or ` standard ' spectrum , proposed by gaisser and honda , then resulting integral muon flux will be even lower , than ours ( see table  2 ) .    there is a possibility to compensate some of the muon deficit by increase of intensity of heavier nuclei in our model . but to get 10% addition to muon flux it is necessary to rise helium flux 50% or to double aggregate flux of cno , ne - si and fe groups .",
    "this mechanism is rather ineffective , because limitations , set by the data on all - particle spectrum thus would require to lower fluxes of other , lighter species .",
    "summarizing , we see , that today for this energy region the situation is determined rather rigidly and the stated problem of muon deficit can not be resolved without some extraordinary assumptions .",
    "necessity in rise of all pcr spectra as high , as possible to diminish the muon shortage , indicates , that measurements with emulsion chambers systematically understate fluxes of the primaries . a large spread in the data on pcr nuclei with @xmath78",
    "provides some more ground for such speculations and demonstrates necessity in further improvement of experimental technique .",
    "this question is closely related to the appropriate description of the characteristics of nuclear interactions and in more details is considered in section  5 .",

    "analysis of this interval in the present situation looks vain for the following reasons :    \\i .",
    "obviously , muon deficit takes place for these energies too , and its nature and quantity are unclear ;    \\ii .",
    "there is no experimental data on chemical composition of pcr spectrum for energies higher than @xmath68  gev , that is why , as in our case , one has to use only theoretical guidelines , describing the origin and transport of cosmic rays in interstellar medium .",
    "behavior of hadron - nucleus cross - sections for @xmath81  gev , despite the decrease of divergence between predictions of different models , remains also not enough studied , that results in additional uncertainty in calculations of the muon spectrum .",
    "all muon component measurements for the given energies are obtained from results of underground experiments and contain quite large systematic errors , that causes their poor mutual agreement .",
    "dominant sources of the mentioned errors are such factors as incomplete information on chemical composition of overburden rock and necessity to input in calculation a ratio @xmath82 of prompt muons to @xmath83-muons as a function of energy , which is not only unknown , but should be determined from the experimental data .",
    "taking aforesaid into account , it seems impossible to make any definite conclusions on behaviour of pcr spectrum and on prompt muon contribution on the basis of sea level data in this energy region .",
    "though from the comparison with the experimental data the vfgs ( volkova , fulgione , galeotti and saavedra ) model  @xcite of charm generation looks as the most preferable , however , here it is needless to stress all unreliability of this deduction .",
    "in this section we intend to discuss some problems , that are inherent to the study of high - energy cosmic rays spectra with the application of the emulsion chambers ( ec ) .",
    "in addition to all factors , listed below , one can easily add some more , that experimenters encounter during processing of the ec data , including , for example , not negligible experimental bias .",
    "we are mostly concentrated at the factors , depending on the description of nuclear interactions , and in this aspect the situation may eventually turn out similar to that with the calculations of sea level muons .",
    "the necessity of further improvements in the experimental technique is clearly recognized in connection with the serious disagreements between the current data on different groups of nuclei , and short history of space and balloon ec experiments gives many examples of how the reported data changed with the gain of experience and statistics .",
    "further investigations will inevitably provide information , that improves our knowledge , and , possibly , will differ from it .",
    "the most detailed description of the experimental technique is presented by the runjob collaboration  @xcite and we shall mostly rely on their data , bearing in mind that the procedure is generally the same in all ec experiments ( mubee , jacee and runjob ) . the key moment lies in the determination of the energy , transferred to the electromagnetic component @xmath84 in the cascades , initiated by the interaction of a primary particle within ec .",
    "this energy is related to the initial energy @xmath85 via partial inelasticity coefficient @xmath86 ( we shall denote so @xmath87 to avoid further confusion with the spectral index @xmath30 ) . the spectrum of primaries is obtained from the spectrum of electromagnetic cascades ( emc ) with a simple shift in the energy scale by the value @xmath88^{-1/\\gamma},\\ ] ] here @xmath89 is a distribution function of @xmath86 and @xmath30 is the spectral index of primary spectrum @xmath90 .",
    "the given statement , at the least dating back to as early as 1962  @xcite , holds true , provided @xmath89 does not depend on @xmath85 in a wide energy range .",
    "usually independence of @xmath91 on energy is argued from the evidence , that total and partial @xmath92 inelasticities are constant . but this may prove to be incorrect ( see , e.g  @xcite ) , since @xmath93 essentially depends on the contribution of the large values of @xmath86 to the distribution @xmath89 , and even though @xmath92 is constant , ` tail ' of @xmath89 may change with @xmath85 . besides , large body of information on behaviour of the total inelasticity , presented in the literature , points at its slow growth with energy .",
    "another important moment , is the difference in @xmath92 between predictions of various interaction models . in comparison with fritiof , applied by runjob",
    ", venus gives @xmath94 lower value of partial inelasticitiy @xmath92 in a single _ p - a _ , he_-a _ collisions  @xcite ( other experiments do not provide information neither on the code used , nor on the single interaction characteristics ) .",
    "note , that 10% correction to the energy conversion from @xmath84 to @xmath85 for power pcr flux @xmath95 is equivalent to @xmath96 correction to the intensity .",
    "thus , at first sight , the use of the venus provides not only the largest number of muons at sea level , but , as well may lead to an increase of the measured proton and helium fluxes .",
    "in fact , the estimation of the influence of the discussed effect on the results of ec measurements is much more complicated .",
    "firstly , one needs to evaluate total energy , transferred to emc in successive interactions of secondary particles , i.e. from the whole shower , not from single interaction , and to obtain distribution function @xmath89 for this fraction @xmath86 of the initial energy .",
    "secondly , this distribution for @xmath86 is rather broad , so the conversion to @xmath85 for individual shower is impossible and it is necessary to derive effective value of @xmath91 , allowing to get pcr spectrum from the emc one .",
    "so , simple knowledge of differences in @xmath92 in the first interaction does not allow to make straightforward qualitative estimate of changes in the final energy shift value .",
    "the analysis becomes even more complicated , if to account , that the choice of the interaction model strongly influences the previous steps of the experimental data processing .",
    "namely , it affects the determination of @xmath84 and detection efficiency . for evaluation of both of these values a complete simulation of nuclear cascades in ec",
    "is required .",
    "for example , in the runjob experiment",
    "the ` actual ' emc energy @xmath97 is obtained from the estimated with the @xmath30-ray core method one @xmath98 via direct monte - carlo simulation of showers with the fritiof code . in the jacee experiment  @xcite determination of cascade energies also involves complete monte - carlo calculations of the transition curves , used for calibration of the @xmath84 , derived from the direct electron counting or from the x - ray film densitometry .",
    "analogous calculations are required for evaluation of the detection efficiency ( see detailed description in  @xcite ) .",
    "thus , deviations between the interaction models in hadron - nucleus cross - sections , energy spectra , multiplicities and phase space distributions ( this is important for estimation of the most energetic in the lab system and back - scattered in cms numbers of gamma - quanta .",
    "venus predicts the largest quantity of the latter , compared to the other models  @xcite ) of seconday particles , in fluctuations of the energy , transferred to emc , etc .",
    ", may significantly influence the interpretation of the ec measurements results .",
    "the mentioned arguments give enough ground for performing of thorough analysis of sensitivity of the ec data to the use of various interaction models , which is still missing .",
    "this as well would allow to make fully consistent estimations of the cosmic ray fluxes , i.e. with the application of the single model , both at the top of the atmosphere and at the sea level .",
    "besides , it is possible that some data distortion may come from changes or anomalies in characteristics of hadronic interactions at very high - energies . at present , these questions are widely discussed in connection with the data of eas experiments , also employing ec technique",
    ".    another hypothetical reason , which may cause systematic errors in processing of the ec experiments data , could be the presence of sizable fraction of unusual component in pcr .",
    "this may be regarded equivalent to the ` change ' in hadronic interactions and all aforesaid about that effect holds true in the given case . in this connection , rising interest to the primary antiproton component deserves closer attention .",
    "ratio from the ground - based experiments : @xcite    solid arrows ; dashed arrows : @xcite  tibet , @xcite  l3+c , @xcite  macro . ]    as it is appropriately supposed , antiprotons present natural compound of pcr , produced mostly in interactions of nuclei ( dominantly protons ) with interstellar medium . other , exotic @xmath99 generation mechanisms , result in softer spectra and they are out of interest for the energies , we are dealing with ( for more information , see references in caption to figure  [ antip ] and _ e.g. _",
    "the experimental study of @xmath99 component began in 1970 s from the first balloon measurements ( golden et al .",
    "@xcite and bogomolov et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and today the direct data cover region from few mev to approximately 40  gev ( figure  [ antip ] ) .",
    "higher energy region is scarcely studied and is marked by few indirect upper estimates of @xmath100 ratio .",
    "one of them by stephens ( 1985 )  @xcite is derived from the analysis of sea level muon charge ratio .",
    "soon we shall present elsewhere such calculations with the employment of improved since then knowledge on pcr fluxes , hadronic interactions and muon charge ratio .",
    "other three @xmath100 estimates by tibet  @xcite , l3+c  @xcite and macro  @xcite collaborations are made with the use of the moon and the sun shadow effects .",
    "the idea of this approach is the following : positively and negatively charged particles are deflected by the earth s magnetic field to the opposite sides , and when the sun or the moon , during their transit over detector , block particles , deficit of secondary particles should be observed , if antimatter presents in pcr along with the matter , at the both opposite sides of the real sun / moon positions .",
    "since these experiments failed to detect ` antimatter shadow ' , they could report only upper limits of @xmath100 ratio to be equal 22% at 10  tev  @xcite , 27.5% at 20  tev  @xcite and 15% for muon sample with @xmath101  gev ( primary energy @xmath12  tev )  @xcite .",
    "theoretical predictions are not able to clarify the situation , since there is no generally recognized propagation theory , reproducing satisfactory even low energy data on @xmath100 ratio together with all totality of the data on elemental nuclei abundances , secondary to primary nuclei ratios , and fluxes of positrons and gammas .",
    "standard diffusion / reacceleration models fail to do this , requiring introduction of specific assumptions , generally working for description of some kind of observations , but leading to contradictions in other cases . among such assumptions",
    "one may readily call necessity in ` artificial breaks in diffusion coefficients and in the primary injection spectrum '  @xcite to match both @xmath100 and secondary to primary nuclei ratios , suggestion about harder interstellar proton and/or electron spectra to explain well known ` gev excess ' in diffuse gamma ray flux , etc .",
    "( for more information see , _",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . the detailed discussion of these problems is beyond the scope of our paper and we shall return to it elsewhere .    in any case , it is clear , that there is no firm ground to state neither the presence of significant fraction of @xmath99 s for high energies , nor the reverse and that actual @xmath100 ratio is still to be determined via direct and various kinds of indirect observations .",
    "thus , one can not completely exclude probability , that among events , identified in ec as protons , sizable fraction of antiprotons presents .",
    "as it is already said above , it is difficult to estimate the influence of the differences between _ p - a _ and _ @xmath99-a _ interaction characteristics on the results of pcr measurements with ec .",
    "it is known that antiprotons deposit more energy into @xmath30 s , than @xmath102 in a single interaction  @xcite , but , we should repeat , the complete analysis of changes , produced in the measured @xmath103 flux requires to perform evaluation of many parameters , that is possible to do only via direct monte - carlo simulations with respect to the specific experimental conditions .",
    "we have made similar estimates for the total muon flux at sea level .",
    "as we have elucidated , actually all primary nucleons in our calculations are protons . replacing them by antiprotons , we have computed integral muon flux for @xmath104  gev and have not found any noticeable changes , in comparison with the calculations for protons . in other words , total vertical sea level muon flux turned out to be insensitive to the fraction of antiprotons in pcr and , possibly , the same may happen with the ec results .",
    "of course , this is not true for @xmath105 and @xmath106 spectra , and @xmath4 ratio , their calculations may help to determine presence of @xmath99 s in pcr .    in conclusion",
    ", we would like to present an estimation of the changes in nucleon flux , required to match the muon experimental data . in figure  [ nucleon_shift ]",
    "we show , along with initially applied spectrum , its part for @xmath107  tev 8% shifted toward the higher energies . from the magnet spectrometers region to the ec energies we use an interpolation .",
    "so , muon spectra , given in figures  [ adiff],[aint ] , are calculated with the use of the combined nucleon flux , shown in figure  [ nucleon_shift ] with open circles .",
    "these spectra still present rather a lower estimate of the muon data and may be approximated via the following formula ( energy is in gev , @xmath108  gev ) @xmath109 with parameters , given in table  3 .",
    "the used nucleon spectrum is just a model spectrum , since in practice , correction to the pcr flux hardly may be constant and should depend both on the energy and atomic mass of the projectile .",
    "but it is easy to note , that required 8% shift is significantly smaller , than the quoted accuracy of the energy determination in the ec experiments and , on the other hand , to some part it may be attributed to the effects , discussed in this section .    , [ ai nt ] . ]     with open circles .",
