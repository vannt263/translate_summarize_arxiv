    "recently there has been much interest in the study of quantum transport in quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) materials , such as quantum wires and carbon nanotubes @xcite . in 1d systems the effect of electron - electron ( e - e ) correlations can not be disregarded , giving rise to a dramatic departure from the fermi liquid picture of usual condensed matter systems .",
    "this new state of matter is called a luttinger liquid ( ll)@xcite , and is characterized by correlation functions that decay with distance through exponents that depend on the e - e interaction @xcite .",
    "this peculiar behavior leads to the prediction of striking phenomena such as spin - charge separation and charge fractionalization , both experimentally confirmed@xcite @xcite .",
    "it is specially interesting to analyze time - dependent aspects of transport @xcite in this context . indeed , the interplay between correlation - induced effects and dynamical phenomena , originated in the out of equilibrium nature of transport , is a highly non trivial problem that deserves much attention .",
    "in fact , a detailed knowledge of the ll behavior in the presence of time - dependent perturbations will facilitate the development of devices based on quantum computation , single electron transport and quantum interferometers@xcite .",
    "but there is also a more profound motivation to discuss this problem , since it is directly connected to basic issues such as the evolution of the ground state and currents after a quench , according to the influence of different initial conditions @xcite . in a recent work@xcite",
    "we have analyzed the response of a ll ( formed by electrons in a quantum wire ) to a sudden switch of an interaction of the system with an external field ( a local barrier created by applying a voltage to a narrow metal gate electrode in a single - walled carbon nanotube @xcite ) .",
    "when such a barrier , that can be considered as a backscattering impurity , is turned on at a finite time @xmath1 , a backscattered current @xmath2 is produced . in ref . a quantitative relation between the time evolution of @xmath2 and the constant @xmath0 , related to e - e correlations , was obtained .",
    "thus , it was shown that @xmath0 could be determined by measuring time intervals within the reach of recently developed pump - probe techniques with femtosecond - attosecond time resolutions @xcite .",
    "this result was obtained under the assumption that the length of the wire was infinite .",
    "it is then very important , in order to make the predictions more realistic , to understand the role that the finite size of the sample will play in the time evolution of the electrical current .",
    "this is the main purpose of this article .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the effects of finite length of a quantum wire on its transport properties were previously investigated in refs .",
    ", , and , but for the case of a static impurity .",
    "besides its direct interest in the area of one - dimensional strongly correlated systems , our work reveals some general features of time - dependent transport in confined geometries that could contribute to a deeper understanding of the behavior of other materials , such as graphene nanoribbons under the sudden switch - on of a constant electric field @xcite or a constant bias voltage @xcite .",
    "another interesting problem , closely connected with our findings , is the role of interacting leads in transport through a quantum point - contact . concerning this issue",
    "it has been recently shown that the switching process has a large impact on the relaxation and the steady - state behavior of the current @xcite . however , for the sake of clarity let us stress that , in contrast to the situation discussed in ref . , where the interaction between the wire and the contacts that leads to the bias voltage v is also switched on at a given time , here we only consider the switching of the time - dependent impurity , whereas the external voltage is assumed to act at all times .",
    "our study is also of interest in the context of cold atomic gases , where quantum quenches are being intensively investigated @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the model and define the backscattered current @xmath2 . in section iii , in order to facilitate the understanding of our main results , concerned with finite size effects , we recall the results obtained for an infinite wire . section iv contains the original contributions of this paper .",
    "we present a closed expression that gives the time - dependence of the backscattered current as an integral of a function that contains , through an infinite product , the effect of the finite length @xmath3 of the wire and the position of the impurity . by combining both analytical and numerical methods",
    ", we examine the evolution of the current for different wire sizes ( figs .",
    "2 - 4 ) . finally , in section v , we summarize our results and conclusions .",
    "we consider a clean luttinger liquid of length @xmath3 adiabatically coupled to two electrodes at its end points ( @xmath4 ) with chemical potentials @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "this gives rise to an applied constant external voltage @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the charge of an electron .",
    "we restrict our study to the case in which the electrodes are held at the same temperature .",
    "this condition is very important in order to apply standard bosonization techniques @xcite . indeed , as was recently explained in ref .",
    ", standard bosonization is expected to work well only in special situations corresponding to small deviations from equilibrium . under this condition the background current flowing in the wire",
    "is @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "if a point like impurity is switched on in the wire at finite time , a contribution additional to @xmath10 due the effect of this impurity appears and the total current now is @xmath11 . in order to compute @xmath2 , after employing the usual bosonization technique @xcite , the system is described by the following lagrangian density : @xmath12 the first term describes the dynamics of the conduction electrons and is modeled by a spinless tomonaga - luttinger liquid with renormalized fermi velocity @xmath13 , @xmath14 where the bosonic field @xmath15 is related to the charge density @xmath16 , @xmath17 when @xmath18 and @xmath19 when @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the fermi velocity and @xmath0 represents the strength of the electron - electron interactions . for repulsive interactions @xmath22 , and for noninteracting electrons @xmath23 .",

    "@xmath29 is a short - distance cutoff .",
    "we only consider backscattering between electrons and impurities , since at the lowest order in the perturbative expansion in the coupling @xmath30 forward scattering does not change the transport properties studied here .",

    "indeed , since it is connected with the time evolution of the total number of right moving particles , it involves an integral of the corresponding density over the @xmath40-variable .",
    "of course , it does depend on the position of the impurity @xmath41 , due to the ultralocal impurity hamiltonian derived from ( [ impurity lagrangian ] ) . in order to compute @xmath2 one substitutes",

    "( [ factorf ] ) we employ the keldysh formalism , a well known technique that renders the study of nonequilibrium systems more accessible @xcite .",
    "we use baker - haussdorff formula and the fact that the commutator of the @xmath43-fields is a c - number .",
    "this allows to write the v.e.v . of an exponential as the exponential of a v.e.v",
    ".. the result is an expression that depends on keldysh lesser function @xmath44 .",

    "we note that for @xmath52 , the backscattered current becomes large when @xmath53 decreases .",
    "hence , the perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath54 breaks down when @xmath55 . using a scaling analysis we can estimate that this expansion is valid when @xmath56 .",
    "we emphasize that expression ( [ pu ] ) does not include the case @xmath57 , where the current is zero too .",
    "all these statements imply that the current must be a nonmonotonic function of @xmath53 . in order to determine this function",
    "one has to go beyond the lowest - order perturbative results of this work .    when the impurity is switched on at a finite time @xmath58 , the current exhibits for finite times a relaxation dynamics to its asymptotic value @xmath59 .",
    "the time - dependent backscattering current dynamics acquires a complicated form , yet it can be written in terms of known analytic functions:@xmath60 [ \\omega_{0 } ( t - t_{0 } ) ] ^{2 - 2 k}}{\\gamma[k]\\gamma[2 - k ] } \\\\ \\times { } _ { 1}f_{2 } ( 1 - k ; 3/2 , 2 - k ; - [ \\omega_{0 } ( t - t_{0})/2]^{2})\\,i_{bs}(\\infty ) , \\label{current}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the generalized hypergeometric function and @xmath62 is the josephson frequency related to the source voltage .",

    "we thus find an explicit connection between electron interactions and the switching time of the externally controlled barrier : the stronger the correlations , the longer the persistence of the non adiabatic effect .",
    "a determination of the current as function of time with a temporal resolution smaller than @xmath70 is a direct method to obtain the exponent of the temporal decay , and then , the @xmath0 value of the quantum wire . we emphasize that this proposed method is performed at constant source - drain voltage",

    ". we will show how the combined effects of a sudden switch - on of an externally controlled barrier and the quantum interference originated by reflections at the ends of the wire ( which are now at finite distances from the barrier ) , modify the time evolution of the backscattered current .",
    "the crucial point is that , when the wire has a finite length @xmath3 the function ( [ factorf ] ) becomes dependent on @xmath3 and @xmath41 . in this case",

    "we have checked that taking the limit @xmath45 one recovers the result given in eq.([current ] ) .",
    "in contrast to that case , in the present situation the derivation of an approximate expression that could facilitate the physical interpretation is not a trivial task . despite of this fact , it is possible to obtain an analytical expression for ( [ tresd ] ) following the lines explained in ref .",
    "let us first define the dimensionless parameter @xmath80 so that for @xmath81 we have the case of large ( small ) length .",

    "for very long times the current approaches the value corresponding to the case in which one has a static impurity immersed in a wire of length @xmath3 .",
    "now , we analyze the envelope of the oscillatory function found for the backscattered current , for the case of a long wire ( @xmath116 ) .",

    ", the decay is the same as in the case of an infinite wire , found in ( [ g ] ) : @xmath123 .    for an asymmetrical arrangement in which @xmath111 , the general pattern of the evolution is distorted ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . in particular the heights of the temporal steps ( the values of the current envelope in each step )",
    "do not decrease monotonically , and their durations are not all equal ( they were all equal to @xmath107 when @xmath124 ) . moreover , these durations follow an alternated pattern of the form @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath125 , with @xmath127 and @xmath128 ( note that @xmath129 ) . the decay laws that we found for these @xmath101-windows are : @xmath130 for @xmath131 ; @xmath132 for @xmath133 and @xmath134 for @xmath135 . here",
    "the natural number @xmath136 does not label windows .",
    "the value @xmath137 gives the behavior corresponding to the first three @xmath101-windows that appear in the interval @xmath138 .",
    "this basic pattern is repeated along the subsequent intervals of duration @xmath139 , the corresponding exponents are given by the following values of @xmath136 .",
    "a word of caution is in order here regarding the limit @xmath140 .",
    "notice that when considering this limit in the expressions above one does not recover the exponents for an impurity placed at the center of the wire .",
    "this is so because the correlation function corresponding to the general case ( @xmath111 ) has pairs of different singularities that merge when @xmath124 .",
    "a similar situation is discussed in the study of finite length effects for an static impurity presented in ref ..",
    "the relationship between the relaxation process and the strength of coulomb electron correlations revealed in our analysis provides an alternative way to determine the luttinger parameter @xmath0 through time measurements . since the total current has the form @xmath141 , a determination of the current as a function of time ( keeping the source - drain voltage constant ) with a temporal resolution smaller than @xmath142 , enables to obtain the exponent of the temporal decay , and then the @xmath0 value of the quantum wire .",
    "interestingly , having taken into account the finite size of the system , our results suggest another possible experimental application .",
    "indeed , the experimental determination of the duration of the @xmath101-windows described above allows to obtain the value of the ratio of josephson to ballistic frequencies @xmath143 .",
    "thus , if @xmath53 , @xmath3 and the fermi velocity @xmath21 are known ( the last one can be obtained by photoemission spectroscopy ) , this simple technique gives another way of finding the luttinger parameter .    finally , for completeness , we explore transport properties in short wires ( @xmath144 ) . in this case",
    "the asymptotic expansion described above is not valid and then we are led to analyze eq .",
    "( [ tresd ] ) numerically . in figure 4",
    "we show the behavior of @xmath2 for short wires . in this case",
    "the structure of  temporal steps \" disappears and finite - time switching effects are relevant for @xmath145 . in this regime",
    "one observes a monotonous growth of the backscattered current , with discontinuities in the time - derivative that take place at @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "for @xmath148 the current also tends to the static - impurity value @xmath59 , as expected .",
    "thus , in practice , for short wires , the oscillation of the current as function of @xmath149 ceases to be appreciable .",
    "this is due to the fact that , for fixed @xmath0 and @xmath53 , the josephson current @xmath150 becomes negligible when compared with the ballistic frequency @xmath151 .",
    "in contrast to what happens for long wires , where an ultrafast current growth is followed by an oscillatory decay pattern , here @xmath2 undergoes a rapid increase towards the steady - state current , which goes as @xmath152 and has a monotonic decrease with @xmath153 . in this sense one could say that , in a sufficiently short wire , instead of a relaxation process ( after the initial jump ) , a monotonic enhancement , saturating at the steady - state current , is predicted .     in units of @xmath59 for @xmath144 and the impurity located at @xmath154 ( solid line ) and @xmath155 ( dashed line ) . ]",
    "to summarize , we have analyzed the characteristics of time - dependent transport in a tomonaga - luttinger liquid subjected to a constant bias voltage , when a weak barrier is suddenly switched on .",
    "the novel features of our investigation come from the consideration of a wire with a finite length @xmath3 .",
    "we focused our attention on the backscattered current @xmath2 which is originated by the abrupt appearance of the barrier .",
    "we showed that , in comparison with the case @xmath117 , for which the current relaxes to the steady - state value with an envelope that obeys the simple law @xmath156 , finite size effects lead to a much more complex and rich evolution . in order to grasp the main features of this dynamics ,",
    "we have identified different regimes in terms of the josephson frequency @xmath157 and the ballistic frequency @xmath158 . in particular , when the applied bias ( @xmath53 ) and the electron - electron correlations ( @xmath0 ) are held fixed , the ratio @xmath159 provides a natural parameter to characterize  long \" ( @xmath160 ) and  short \" ( @xmath161 ) wires . in this context",
    "it becomes natural to compare the results obtained for @xmath160 with the previously known behavior found in infinite systems .",
    "we found that for long sizes the evolution of @xmath2 presents a new structure of temporal steps , each of which with a different decay law with the generic form @xmath162 , where @xmath163 depends on @xmath164 , @xmath151 and @xmath41 , and @xmath74 is an andreev - like reflection parameter .",
    "the constant @xmath165 is simply 1 or 2 , depending on the @xmath101-step one is looking at . since @xmath166 and @xmath164 is a natural number that labels each time window , being @xmath164 bigger for longer times , the older the window the slower the relaxation .",
    "these results display the way in which the combined effects of electronic correlations and quantum interference , originated by reflected waves at the interfaces with the electrodes , affect the transient process .      from the point of view of the potential applications of our study",
    "it is specially interesting the case of long wires , for which we were able to derive approximate asymptotic expressions from which one determines the durations of the temporal steps and the power laws obeyed by the envelope of the current in the time intervals where a relaxation takes place .",
    "if one measures the decay of the current along these intervals , the value of @xmath0 can be obtained from the exponents @xmath167 , where the values of both @xmath165 and @xmath164 are univocally given by the @xmath101-window for which the measurement is performed . a second method , probably easier to implement ,",
    "is also indicated by our findings . indeed , as explained in the text , just by measuring the endpoints of the @xmath101-windows , taking into account that @xmath3 and @xmath41 are assumed to be known ( remember that in the context of our investigation the impurity is assumed to be due to an external gate )",
    ", one can determine the value of @xmath143 .",
    "since the bias voltage @xmath53 is also externally controlled and held fixed , this simple technique gives a direct way of finding the ratio @xmath168 .",
