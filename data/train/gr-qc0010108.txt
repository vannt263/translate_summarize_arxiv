    "recent advances in laser cooling of atoms have led to the development of a number of highly accurate atomic clocks ( caesium and rubidium fountains ) which have improved time - keeping accuracy by an order of magnitude during the nineties to currently @xmath5 in fractional frequency ( laurent et al .",
    "1999 , bize et al .",
    "1999 ) . for further improvement of accuracy ,",
    "the fountain clocks are limited by gravity , and therefore several experiments are planned for the near future that will fly laser cooled atomic clocks on board terrestrial satellites .",
    "one of these is esa s atomic clock ensemble in space ( aces ) mission ( salomon & veillet 1996 ) planned for 2005 .",
    "this mission will place a laser cooled caesium clock together with a hydrogen maser on board the international space station . when combined with equally accurate time / frequency transfer systems that allow the comparison between space and ground clocks , the experiment should become a useful tool for a number of applications in metrology , fundamental physics , atmospheric studies , geodesy etc .",
    "therefore the aces mission will include sufficiently stable optical and microwave time and frequency transfer systems to allow the comparison of the clocks with negligible noise contribution from the transfer system itself . at the required accuracy",
    "this condition calls for two - way systems that exchange electromagnetic pulses in two directions in order to eliminate or reduce a number of unwanted effects associated with the instrumental delays , the propagation within the ionosphere and troposphere , etc .",
    "the time transfer by laser light ( t2l2 ) system ( fridelance , samain & veillet 1996 ) uses optical pulses that are emitted on the ground , reflected by the satellite and received back on the ground .",
    "the events of emission and reception are dated on the ground clock , and the event of reflection on the satellite clock .",
    "the microwave system is expected to exchange pulses in both directions and date all events of emission and reception .",
    "it will also measure the frequency of the emitted and received pulses on board and on the ground .",
    "additionally it is expected to include two down - link signals at different frequencies in order to allow the cancellation of the residual ionospheric effect .    at the required uncertainties a fundamentally relativistic modelling of the experiment is indispensable . indeed",
    "the relativistic effects when comparing two clocks separated by an altitude of @xmath6 km ( as is the case for aces ) can amount to several parts in @xmath7 , which exceeds the expected uncertainties of the clocks ( @xmath8 ) by several orders of magnitude .",
    "evidently , a relativistic treatment of distant clock comparisons using electromagnetic signals becomes necessary whenever the uncertainties of such experiments become smaller than the size of the relativistic corrections .",
    "this has already been the case for the gravity probe a ( gp - a ) experiment ( vessot et al .",
    "1980 ) , and is more generally the case since the advent of the global positioning system ( gps ) which is now extensively used for distant clock comparisons .",
    "the first theoretical treatments of such comparisons in a relativistic framework were performed by jaffe & vessot ( 1976 ) , ashby & allan ( 1979 ) , vessot , levine et al .",
    "( 1980 ) , allan & ashby ( 1985 ) , and klioner ( 1993 ) .",
    "subsequent new methods with improved uncertainties , such as the two way time transfer ( twtt ) ( hetzel & soring 1993 ) and the laser synchronization from stationary orbit ( lasso ) ( veillet & fridelance 1993 ) , have led to the need for more accurate theoretical treatments that include some higher order terms ( petit & wolf 1994 , 1997 , wolf & petit 1995 , klioner & fukushima 1994 ) .",
    "the latter papers treat in some detail the synchronization ( time transfer ) between distant clocks using electromagnetic signals and the relation between the proper time of a clock on the earth or on board terrestrial satellites and the geocentric coordinate time , tcg .",
    "the relativistic theory for frequency transfer has been revisited recently by ashby ( 1998 ) , leading to results similar to those presented in subsection [ 4.2 ] . in the perspective of the expected uncertainties of the aces and other similar experiments , for time as well as frequency transfer , a re - examination of these formalisms",
    "has proved necessary .",
    "this is the subject of the present paper .",
    "essentially we shall compute the relativistic transfers of time and frequency , including all the terms up to the order @xmath2 . the coordinate time transfer up to this order",
    "is well known as it consists of the standard shapiro time delay . concerning the frequency transfer , we find that the formula for the one - way transfer is rather complicated",
    ". our main result will concern the formula for the two - way frequency transfer , up to order @xmath2 .",
    "this formula appeared previously in the paper by ashby ( 1998 ) but without a detailed derivation . in this paper , we derive this formula and , more generally , we present a self - contained derivation of all the formulae needed in this context",
    ". these formulae will be of direct use in the aces experiment , and _ a fortiori _ in more precise future experiments .",
    "higher - order relativistic corrections are negligible with respect to the projected uncertainties associated with aces .    the numerical applications made in this paper concern the aces mission with a transfer from the space station @xmath9 orbiting at the altitude @xmath10 km to a ground station located at @xmath11 . for the velocities",
    "involved we use @xmath12 m / s and @xmath13 m / s ; for the gravitational potentials , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ; and for the earth parameters @xmath16 @xmath17 and @xmath18 m. we consider that the experimental uncertainties of aces will be at the level of 5 ps for time transfer and @xmath0 for frequency transfer .",
    "the paper is organized in such a way that the main text summarizes all the results needed by an experimental team in setting up a relativistic time and/or frequency transfer , with all the proofs and theoretical details relegated to the appendix . in section [ sect2 ]",
    "we treat the problem of the transformation from proper time to coordinate time tcg at a level sufficient for ground clocks and the aces space clock . in section [ sect3 ]",
    "we give the expressions required for time transfer ( including sagnac terms ) , and in section [ sect4 ] for frequency transfer .",
    "both the one - way and two - way transfers are considered in each case .",
    "throughout this work we use the geocentric inertial ( non - rotating ) coordinate frame grs : geocentric reference system .",
    "thus , @xmath19tcg is the geocentric coordinate time and the terrestrial time @xmath20 ( realized by the international atomic time , tai ) is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a defining constant fixed in iau resolution b1.9 ( iau 2000 ) as @xmath23 ; this value was chosen to be close to the previous definition @xmath24 ( iau 1991 ) where @xmath25 is the earth potential ( gravitational plus centrifugal ) at the reference geoid close to the mean surface of the oceans . ] , and @xmath26 are the grs harmonic spatial coordinates , for which the spatial metric is conformally flat to order @xmath1 . in these coordinates the metric interval including all the terms up to the order @xmath1 reads    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the total newtonian potential , with the convention that @xmath29 ( iau 1991 ) , and where @xmath30 denotes the euclidean space metric .",
    "the solar - system barycentric coordinates , centred on the barycenter of the solar system , are denoted @xmath31tcb : solar system barycentric coordinate time , and @xmath32 : solar system spatial ( harmonic ) coordinates .",
    "the proper time of a clock @xmath9 located at the grs coordinate position @xmath33 , and moving with the coordinate velocity @xmath34 , is    @xmath35\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath36 denotes the newtonian potential of the earth at the position @xmath37 of the clock in the grs frame , and @xmath38 is the sum of the newtonian potentials of the other bodies ( mainly the sun and the moon ) , either at the position @xmath39 of the earth center of mass in barycentric coordinates , or at the clock location @xmath40 .",
    "the three terms involving the potential @xmath38 represent the tidal field of the other bodies at the position of the clock .",
    "[ to a good approximation ( introducing errors of much less than @xmath41 ) one can write @xmath42 .",
    "then , as usual , the tidal field at the position @xmath37 can be approximated using a taylor expansion by the standard expression @xmath43 again neglecting terms smaller than @xmath41 . ]",
    "the terms due to the tides of the other bodies ( i.e. involving @xmath38 ) are small for the ground station and the low orbit of aces ( of order @xmath44 ) and are either negligible or easily evaluated if required ( depending on the final clock accuracies reached ) .",
    "the last term in ( [ 2 ] ) is due to the non - geodesic acceleration of the center of mass of the earth that is induced by the mass quadrupole of the earth[multiblock footnote omitted ] , and which is numerically of the order of @xmath45 .",
    "this term is negligible in the case of the envisioned experiments : numerically @xmath46 amounts to less that @xmath4 .",
    "thus , for application to aces , and more generally to any experiment at a level of uncertainty greater than @xmath0 on a satellite at similar altitude as aces , we can keep only the first three terms in the relation ( [ 2 ] ) between the proper time @xmath47 and the coordinate time @xmath48 :    @xmath49\\;.\\ ] ]    note that at this level of uncertainty it is crucial to take into account in the relation ( [ 3 ] ) the non - sphericity ( oblaticity ) of the earth newtonian potential .",
    "in fact , it is even not sufficient to model the earth potential with a @xmath50-term taking into account the quadrupolar deformation .",
    "rather , the potential @xmath51 should be computed according to the detailed procedures of wolf and petit ( 1995 ) , and petit and wolf ( 1997 ) .",
    "for example , for a clock @xmath11 fixed on the earth surface , the relativistic correction term appearing in the coordinate / proper time relation ( [ 3 ] ) is given with the required precision by    @xmath52    where @xmath25 is the earth potential at the reference geoid ( @xmath53 ) , where @xmath54 denotes the ( gravitational plus centrifugal ) earth acceleration , and where @xmath55 is the geometric height of the clock above the reference geoid .",
    "note that this procedure is limited by the uncertainty in the determination of @xmath25 which at present gives rise to an error of about 1 part in @xmath56 in @xmath57 . for uncertainties below that level",
    ", it is expected that , inversely , clock comparisons with highly accurate space clocks will yield the best estimate of the potential on the ground .",
    "let @xmath9 be the emitting station , with grs position @xmath33 , and @xmath11 the receiving station , with position @xmath58 .",
    "we denote by @xmath59 the coordinate time at the instant of emission of a light signal , and by @xmath60 the coordinate time at the instant of reception .",
    "we put @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the euclidean norm associated with the metric @xmath65 . up to the order @xmath2 the coordinate time transfer @xmath66",
    "is given by    @xmath67    where the logarithmic term represents the shapiro time delay where @xmath68 is the standard ppn parameter . ]",
    "( shapiro 1964 ) . see the appendix for several derivations of the shapiro time delay and for an alternative expression given by ( [ a32 ] ) . in the case of zenithal geometry ,",
    "i.e. propagation of the signal along the local vertical ( for which @xmath69 ) , between the orbit of aces at 400 km ( assumed in all numerical examples below ) and the ground , the shapiro time delay is 2 @xmath70 . in the case of zero elevation ,",
    "it is 11 @xmath70 .    in a real experiment ,",
    "the position of the receptor @xmath11 may be recorded at the time of emission @xmath59 rather than at the time of reception @xmath60 , i.e. we may have more direct access to @xmath71 rather than @xmath72 , and the formula ( [ 6 ] ) gets modified by some sagnac correction terms consistently to the order @xmath2 . in this case the formula becomes    @xmath73    where @xmath74 is the `` instantaneous '' coordinate distance between @xmath9 and @xmath11 at the instant of emission at @xmath9 ( we have @xmath75 ) , where @xmath76 denotes the coordinate velocity of the station @xmath11 at that instant , and where @xmath77 is the acceleration of @xmath11 ( in all the small correction terms of order @xmath2 one can use , independent of the required order , the quantities at the instants @xmath59 or @xmath60 ) .",
    "the second term in ( [ 7 ] ) represents the sagnac term of order @xmath1 and can amount to 200 @xmath78 at low elevation ; the third term or sagnac of order @xmath2 is about 5 @xmath79 at low elevation ( to be compared with the shapiro term , which is 11 @xmath70 ) .",

    "the frequency transfer between two clocks requires the determination of the ratio @xmath90 between the proper frequencies @xmath91 and @xmath92 delivered by the clocks on the satellite ( @xmath9 ) and on the ground ( @xmath11 ) . in practice",
    "this is achieved using a transmission of photons from @xmath9 to @xmath11 and the formula    @xmath93    where @xmath94 is the proper frequency of the photon as measured on @xmath9 ( instant of emission @xmath59 ) , and @xmath95 the proper frequency of the same photon on @xmath11 at @xmath60 . the first bracket in ( [ 11 ] )",

    "now , according to ( [ 15 ] ) , in order to reach the @xmath2 precision , the three previous terms are to be corrected by a factor that looks exactly like a first - order doppler effect .",
    "numerically , we have    @xmath133    so this first - order doppler factor induces a correction of the frequency shift at the minimal level @xmath134 , which is measurable by aces .",
    "finally the four last terms in ( [ 15 ] ) are purely of order @xmath2 .",
    "they amount respectively to the maximal values @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and much less for the last two terms .",
    "these last four terms are in general negligible for aces .",
    "the terms which are neglected in the formula ( [ 15 ] ) , which are at least @xmath3 , are numerically of the order of @xmath4 or less , too small to be detected by aces .    in summary , the formula ( [ 15 ] ) and its derivation in the appendix constitute the main results of this paper . to the dominant order @xmath1",
    "the expression was first derived by vessot et al .",

    "the final expression ( [ 15 ] ) is relatively simple , as compared , for instance , to the corresponding expression valid for the one - way frequency transfer [ see ( [ 12])-([13b ] ) ] .",
    "we find indeed that many of the scalar products between @xmath137 and some velocities , though present in the intermediate steps of the calculation , drop out from the final result .",
    "the exception is for the factor in ( [ 15 ] ) which is made of the combination @xmath138 and which can be nicely interpreted as a modification , at the level @xmath2 , of the dominant term of order @xmath1 by a first - order doppler effect .",
    "the set of equations for time and frequency transfers given in this paper should be sufficient for the analysis of the planned clock experiments in earth orbit , at the level @xmath0 in fractional frequency .",
    "this appendix presents several equivalent derivations of the formulas for the time and frequency transfers in the aces experiment . some of the basic material needed in these derivations is not new and can be found in standard textbooks such as misner , thorne & wheeler ( 1973 ) , and will ( 1981 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the problem of the propagation of light in a gravitational field has been solved in a general way at the linearized approximation : see kopeikin & schfer ( 1999 ) for a complete investigation and an entry to the literature . here",
    "we use the explicit solution of the photon motion , the optical distance function for stationary space - times ( buchdahl 1970 , 1979 ) , and the differentiation of the well - known shapiro ( 1964 ) formula .",
    "we shall first consider the transfer of _ coordinate _ geocentric time @xmath48 ; for this purpose it is sufficient to approximate the gravitational field of the earth as spherically symmetric ( monopolar ) , and to neglect tidal terms , hence @xmath139 .",
    "however , as we have seen in section [ sect2 ] , higher spherical harmonics in the earth potential are needed in the relation between coordinate and proper time .",
    "we denote the mass of the earth by @xmath140 , the cartesian geocentric coordinates by @xmath141 , with @xmath142tcg and @xmath143 agreeing to this approximation with the geocentric spatial coordinates ( @xmath144 ) . using spherical coordinates",
    "@xmath145 associated in the standard way to the geocentric coordinates ( @xmath146 , @xmath147 ) , we can write the 1pn metric as            _ photon equations of motion . _ in the geometric optics approximation , where the photon s wavelength is much smaller than the typical size of the electromagnetic wave packet , as well as of the space - time radius of curvature , the photon s wave vector is null , @xmath150 , and is hypersurface - orthogonal , @xmath151 . the differential equation for the trajectory of the ray is @xmath152 .",
    "we have @xmath153 , where we have used the fact that @xmath154 is symmetric as a consequence of @xmath151 , so we find that @xmath155 , which is the geodesic equation , a more useful form of which reads            although the metric ( [ a1])-([a3 ] ) is spherically - symmetric , it is convenient to suppose that the motion of the photon takes place in an arbitrary plane , not necessarily the equatorial plane @xmath161 .",
    "for instance , we can consider that @xmath162 represents the earth s rotation axis , and that the emitted signal comes from a satellite moving on any orbit with inclination angle @xmath163 with respect to the equator . since the metric is stationary and axi - symmetric",
    ", we find immediately the first integrals @xmath164 and @xmath165 , where @xmath166 and @xmath167 denote two constants along the trajectory ( with @xmath168 to ensure @xmath169 ) .",
    "relating @xmath170 and @xmath171 to the contravariant components of the wave vector , @xmath172 and @xmath173 , yields the two integrals of motion      next , the equation corresponding to the @xmath175-coordinate reads @xmath176 . inserting in this equation @xmath173",
    "as deduced from ( [ a6b ] ) , and noting that @xmath177 , we obtain @xmath178 .",
    "this equation shows that @xmath179 is a function of the @xmath175-coordinate only , and we get @xmath180 where @xmath181 is a new constant of the motion .",
    "hence ,          it can be checked that the equation concerning the @xmath185-coordinate , i.e. @xmath186 , is now automatically satisfied .",
    "thus , the photon motion depends on the constants @xmath187 , @xmath181 and @xmath188 ; however , by eliminating the affine parameter @xmath157 in favor of the coordinate time @xmath48 we can parametrize the motion by only two constants , say @xmath189 and @xmath190 . finally , the solution reads      we have introduced the signs @xmath192 and @xmath193 of @xmath194 and @xmath195 . because the metric ( [ a1 ] ) is spherically - symmetric",
    ", one could rotate the coordinates so that the plane of the motion is simply the equatorial plane @xmath161 .",

    "we introduce the angle @xmath198 defined by          where @xmath201 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "clearly this is the equation of the orbital plane .",

    "therefore @xmath262 represents the phase of the signal and can be used to define the wave - vector as @xmath151 . for this choice @xmath265 and @xmath266 . using ( [ a28 ] )",
    "we get        given the simplicity of the result ( [ a28 ] ) for the time transfer when expressed in terms of the euclidean distance @xmath242 , one can guess that the formula can be derived directly by integrating @xmath269 along the path from @xmath9 to @xmath11 .",
    "let us show how this works . with the post - newtonian metric ( [ a1])-([a3 ] )",
    "we have , along the photon s path ,      where @xmath271 is the euclidean norm of the vector @xmath272 . introducing @xmath260 as a new spatial coordinate along the path",
    ", we have @xmath273 where @xmath261 and @xmath274 .",
    "but we know from ( [ a27 ] ) that @xmath275 differs from the unit tangent @xmath276 at the emission point by a small term @xmath249 .",
    "so , when @xmath257 varies ( the origin point @xmath9 on the path being fixed ) , we have @xmath277 and therefore we see that @xmath278 makes a negligible contribution .",
    "this shows that to order @xmath1 inclusively the time transfer can be calculated `` along the straight line '' ; we have          to find the closed - form expression of the integral , we insert @xmath281 which can be approximated , since @xmath282 and the integral already enters a small quantity , by @xmath283 .",
    "next we perform the integration over @xmath284 from @xmath9 to @xmath11 , and we are allowed to replace @xmath285 within the result .",
    "finally we find ( see e.g. will 1981 )            _ sagnac terms_. the formula ( [ a28 ] ) gives the time transfer from the point @xmath288 at the emission instant @xmath59 , to the reception point @xmath289 at the reception instant @xmath60 .",
    "but in fact , in the application to aces , the useful time basis in the experiment is that provided by the clock at the point a ( i.e. , in the satellite ) which records the instant of emission @xmath59 .",
    "therefore , it is more convenient to re - express the time transfer ( [ a28 ] ) in terms of the position of the reception point @xmath11 as it was at the instant @xmath59 rather than at @xmath60 , i.e. when it was instantaneous with the instant of emission at @xmath9 ( in the grs coordinate system ) . thus , we introduce the `` instantaneous '' coordinate distance      and perform a consistent series expansion when @xmath291 tends to zero .",
    "we know from ( [ a28 ] ) that the time transfer @xmath292 .",
    "therefore , with the required accuracy , we can write @xmath293 , where @xmath77 is the acceleration .",
    "the successive relativistic approximations are obtained by working out this formula iteratively together with ( [ a28 ] ) . in this way",
    "we obtain      where all quantities are measured at the emission instant @xmath59 recorded by the on - board clock .",
    "the formula involves the sagnac terms of first ( @xmath1 ) and second ( @xmath2 ) orders , as well as the shapiro time delay [ of course , consistently with the approximation , one can use indifferently in the shapiro term either the distance @xmath295 or @xmath242 , and either @xmath296 or @xmath297 .    _",
    "one - way frequency transfer_. in the geometric optics approximation we have @xmath151 and the phase difference between two successive electromagnetic pulses is @xmath298 , which in other words means @xmath299 where @xmath300 denotes the four - velocity ( such that @xmath301 ) .",
    "now , @xmath302 and @xmath303 are the proper periods of the same signal at @xmath9 and @xmath11 and we have @xmath304 .",
    "therefore , the one - way frequency shift of photons during the transfer from @xmath9 to @xmath11 is      separating out temporal from spatial components , we have @xmath306 , where @xmath307 denotes the coordinate velocity and where @xmath308 . in a stationary space - time",
    "@xmath309 is constant along the trajectory , i.e. @xmath310 in the notation ( [ a6a ] ) ; for instance , we have seen that with the choice @xmath263 , where @xmath38 is the optical distance ( [ a28 ] ) , this constant is equal to minus one .",
    "thus we can write              where @xmath316 and @xmath317 are the newtonian potentials at the levels @xmath9 and @xmath11 .",
    "the factor ( [ a41 ] ) comprises the einstein gravitational red - shift and the second - order doppler effects , which are both of order @xmath1 .",
    "we recall from section [ sect2 ] that at the level of accuracy of aces , the potentials in ( [ a41 ] ) must take into account the oblaticity of the earth .",
    "now the second factor in the right - hand - side of ( [ a40 ] ) is nothing but the ratio of coordinate periods of the same signal at @xmath9 and @xmath11 , namely @xmath318 ; it contains the first - order doppler effect ( @xmath319 ) and the third - order ( @xmath320 ) terms we are looking for . for the computation of this factor at the level @xmath0 we do not need to consider the @xmath50 of the earth potential , and we can approximate @xmath321 . in order to obtain a useful formula , we have only to substitute for the tangent vectors @xmath276 and @xmath322 their expressions in terms of the unit direction @xmath137 into ( [ a40 ] ) . the required relation between these vectors",
    "was found in ( [ a27 ] ) .",
    "alternatively , one can use directly the formula ( [ a28  ] ) .",
    "finally , our end - result for the one - way frequency transfer with @xmath2 accuracy reads        the previous expressions were obtained using our explicit solution ( [ a17])-([a19 ] ) for the photon s trajectory .",
    "however , there is a simpler way to obtain the ratio @xmath107 , which is based on the fact that since it is equal to the ratio of coordinate times : @xmath324 , it can be computed directly by differentiating the coordinate time transfer @xmath251 with respect to the emission time @xmath59 .",
    "the time transfer to order @xmath2 is given by the simple formula ( [ a28 ] ) containing the shapiro term .",
    "thus , we must consider      the differentiation is to be performed taking into account the fact that the coordinate distance between @xmath9 and @xmath11 depends on both the emission and reception times , i.e. @xmath326 . thus we have for instance        _ two - way frequency transfer_. in this method the `` tracking '' signal is emitted from the ground station at point @xmath328 and coordinate time @xmath80 , is received by the satellite at point @xmath9 and time @xmath59 and immediately transponded back to the ground station where it arrives at point @xmath11 and time @xmath60 .",
    "( a generalization of the formulae to the case where there is a time delay between reception and re - emission at @xmath9 is also possible . )",
    "the `` clock '' signal is emitted at @xmath9 , simultaneously with the tracking signal when it is transponded at @xmath9 , and transmitted to @xmath11 .",
    "this technique , called the doppler - cancelling technique , permits us to suppress the first - order doppler effect and to drastically limit the uncertainties linked with the atmospheric contributions ( see e.g. kleppner , vessot & ramsey 1970 ) .",
    "the ratio of the signal frequencies to be inserted in ( [ 11 ] ) follows from          the ratios @xmath332 and @xmath333 are given by the formulas ( [ 12])-([13b ] ) , valid for the one - way transfer , that we must simply insert into ( [ a47 ] ) in order to get the result .",
    "the only problem is to correctly express all the quantities associated with the up - link from the ground station @xmath328 at @xmath80 to the satellite @xmath9 at @xmath59 , in terms of the same quantities associated with the down - link back from the satellite @xmath9 to the station @xmath11 at @xmath60 ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "notably we need to express the unit vector @xmath334 in terms of the unit vector @xmath137 on the way back , as well as the velocity and acceleration @xmath335 and @xmath336 of the ground station at @xmath60 . neglecting @xmath337",
