    "one of the most remarkable properties of globular cluster ( gc ) systems is the similarity of their luminosity functions from one galaxy to another .",
    "these have bell - like shapes and are often modeled as log - normal distributions of luminosities or , equivalently , gaussian distributions of magnitudes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , the luminosity functions of young cluster systems are always found to be power laws , @xmath2 with @xmath3 ( @xcite ; see @xcite for a recent comprehensive study of 20 star - forming galaxies ) .",
    "the mass functions of cluster systems have greater dynamical significance than their luminosity functions . for systems of old , coeval clusters , variations in the mass - to - light ( @xmath0 ) ratios",
    "are relatively small , and the luminosity function is a good proxy for the mass function .",
    "thus , the mass function of globular clusters ( gcmf ) must have nearly the same bell - like shape as the luminosity function ( gclf ) .",
    "however , systems of young clusters in the process of formation have wide spreads in @xmath0 , and the mass function must be determined separately from the luminosity function , usually by estimating the masses , ages , and reddenings of individual clusters in the sample from multi - band photometry .",
    "( see @xcite for the mathematical relations between the mass , luminosity , and age distributions of cluster systems . )",
    "studies of this kind show that the mass functions of young cluster systems are power laws , @xmath4 with @xmath5 ( @xcite , and references therein ) . as a consequence ,",
    "larger systems of young clusters will contain more massive clusters , reaching @xmath6 or even @xmath7 in some cases @xcite .",
    "the most massive of these clusters are often referred to as `` young gcs '' .",
    "there are two possible explanations for the radically different mass functions of young and old cluster systems : either ( 1 ) the process of cluster formation , and hence the initial cluster mass function , differed in the distant past from the present , or ( 2 ) the mass function of clusters evolves by dynamical processes from an initial power law into a bell - shaped distribution . the second possibility",
    " the one we examine in this paper  has been explored at various levels of approximation over the years @xcite .",
    "we focus here on the semi - analytical model for the evolution of the mass function developed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter fz01 ) .    in the fz01 model ,",
    "clusters are tidally limited at the pericenters of their galactic orbits and are disrupted by the gradual escape of stars driven by a combination of internal two - body relaxation and external gravitational shocks . for most clusters , shocks are relatively weak , and relaxation is the dominant disruption mechanism . according to the `` classical '' theory of relaxation - driven stellar escape , as formulated by @xcite and others , the mass @xmath8 of a tidally limited cluster decreases at a nearly constant rate : @xmath9 with @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the mean density within the half - mass radius @xmath12 of the cluster .",
    "fz01 showed that , in this approximation , the evolving gcmf at any time @xmath13 is related to the initial gcmf @xmath14 by @xmath15 .",
    "this has a characteristic bend or peak at @xmath16 and the limiting forms @xmath17 , independent of @xmath8 for @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , independent of @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "fz01 compared their model to the observed gclf in the milky way in the approximation of constant @xmath22 and found excellent agreement . in particular , they showed both theoretically and observationally , for the first time , that the gcmf and gclf are approximately constant for @xmath23 and @xmath24 , in stark contradiction to the then - standard practice of fitting log - normal distributions to the data .",
    "this behavior of the gcmf at small @xmath8 and gclf at small @xmath1 is strong evidence for the late disruption of clusters by internal two - body relaxation .",
    "furthermore , @xcite showed that the predicted time dependence of the fz01 model is consistent with the observed luminosity functions of intermediate - age ( 34 gyr old ) cluster systems , and @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite showed that the predicted density dependence agrees well with the observed mass function for subsamples of clusters defined by different ranges of density .",
    "the approximations in the fz01 model were made for simplicity and to highlight the main physical processes that shape the gcmf and gclf . in particular ,",
    "the adoption of classical evaporation and the neglect of @xmath22 variations are not essential features of the model .",
    "both approximations were in standard use at the time ( 2001 ) to describe the evolution of individual clusters .",
    "the novel feature of the fz01 model was to show how the evolution of the masses of individual clusters could be combined analytically into the evolution of the mass function of a cluster system .",
    "at a higher level of approximation , the stellar escape rate is modified by the fact that some of the stars that are scattered into unbound orbits may be scattered back into bound orbits before they have reached the tidal boundary and escaped from a cluster . in this case , often called `` retarded '' evaporation , the escape rate has a weak dependence on the crossing time @xmath25 in addition to the stronger dependence on the relaxation time @xmath26 . for tidally limited , low - mass clusters ( initial masses @xmath27 ) , the evolution can be approximated by @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 , rather than @xmath31 = 1 for classical evaporation @xcite . for high - mass clusters , however , the retarded evaporation rate must approach the classical rate ( in the limit @xmath32 ; see section [ sub : gamma ] ) .",
    "two - body relaxation will also cause low - mass stars within a cluster to gain energy and escape faster than high - mass stars , thus reducing the average @xmath0 of the remaining stars over and above the fading caused by stellar evolution alone . as a result of this effect ,",
    "in a coeval population of clusters ( such as gcs ) , there should be a positive correlation between @xmath22 and the mass or luminosity of clusters , because those that have smaller relaxation times will have lost larger fractions of their initial mass . such variation in @xmath22",
    "was neglected in the fz01 model for two reasons :  it is difficult to predict reliably from theory , and it appeared from observations at the time to be weak or non - existent @xcite .",
    "* hereafter kpz09 ) modified the fz01 model to include retarded evaporation and a variable @xmath0 ratio .",
    "in particular , they assumed that the rate of mass loss from clusters is given by @xmath33 with @xmath29 and @xmath34 for clusters of all masses .",
    "furthermore , to calculate the escape rates of stars of different masses and hence the variation in @xmath22 of clusters , they employed a semi - analytical model developed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter k09 ) that includes several questionable assumptions and parameter choices .",
    "kpz09 argued that their model is a significant improvement on the fz01 model , both in terms of its theoretical validity and in terms of its ability to fit the observed gclf in the milky way and other galaxies .",
    "our main purpose in this paper is to demonstrate that the kpz09 criticisms of the fz01 model are not correct .",
    "thus motivated , we also show that the variation in @xmath22 with @xmath8 or @xmath1 predicted by the kpz09 model is much stronger than that allowed by observations .",
    "furthermore , we show that the parameter values required for the kpz09 model to fit the observed gclf and the observed @xmath0 vs.  @xmath1 relation are mutually exclusive .",
    "we emphasize that we do not dispute the general physical principles underlying retarded evaporation and @xmath22 variations .",
    "the results of this paper indicate , however , that the specific implementation of these effects in the kpz09 model exaggerates their importance .",
    "we find that retarded evaporation and @xmath22 variations can be neglected for clusters massive enough to survive for a hubble time of dynamical evolution .",
    "therefore , for most practical purposes , the benefits of including these effects are largely offset by the increased complexity of the kpz09 model relative to the fz01 model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ s : gclffits ] , we compare the fz01 and kpz09 models with the observed gclf in the milky way , and we determine the best - fitting values of their parameters including the characteristic dissolution timescale .",
    "section  [ s : dyn ] presents our search for @xmath0 variations of the kind predicted by the kpz09 model in a large compilation of recent dynamical measurements of gc masses . in section  [ s :",
    "tdiss ] , we compare the dissolution timescale required by the kpz09 model to match the observed gclf with the one required by the absence of observed @xmath0 variations .",
    "section  [ s : disc ] interprets the results from sections  [ s : dyn ] and [ s : tdiss ] along with the observed stellar mass functions in galactic gcs in terms of key properties and assumptions of the k09 model .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in section  [ s : conc ] .",
    "in this section , we compare the fz01 and kpz09 models with the observed gclf in the milky way .",
    "we first derive analytical expressions for the evolving gcmfs assuming that the clusters are tidally limited and that stellar escape driven by two - body relaxation is the primary disruption mechanism .",
    "we then convert these gcmfs at an age of 12 gyr into gclfs adopting @xmath0 = constant for the fz01 model and the @xmath0 vs.  @xmath1 relation derived by kpz09 for their model .      in both models considered here",
    ", the mass - loss rate of an individual cluster takes the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the dissolution timescale and @xmath37 and @xmath31 are constants .",
    "this integrates to @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the initial cluster mass .",
    "these formulae are intended to represent smooth averages over the abrupt changes in mass caused by the escape of individual stars and over at least one full orbit of the cluster around its host galaxy . for @xmath40 , equation  ( [ eq : dmdt ] )",
    "describes the classical mass - loss rate @xmath37 for stellar escape driven by internal two - body relaxation from a tidally limited cluster ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this is the formula adopted in the fz01 model . for @xmath41 ,",
    "equation  ( [ eq : dmdt ] ) approximates the corresponding mass - loss rate for retarded evaporation in relatively low - mass clusters for which crossing times are significant fractions of relaxation times @xcite .",
    "the kpz09 model assumes @xmath34 for clusters of all masses .",
    "fz01 showed that the evolution of the mass function @xmath42 of a cluster system could be derived from the evolution of the masses @xmath43 of individual clusters through a continuity equation .",
    "this approach yields @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the initial mass function ( at @xmath46 ) . in this expression ,",
    "the initial mass @xmath39 must be regarded as a function of the current mass @xmath47 and current time @xmath20 as given by inverting equation  ( [ eq : massevol ] ) .",
    "following fz01 , we adopt a @xcite initial mass function @xmath48 with adjustable parameters @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "this function has a power - law shape with exponent @xmath50 below the bend at @xmath52 to mimic the observed mass functions of young cluster systems , and it has an exponential decline above @xmath53 as suggested by the observed tail of the gcmf at @xmath54 . inserting equation  ( [ eq : schech ] ) into equation  ( [ eq : mf ] ) then yields the evolving gcmf : @xmath55\\!\\!\\mbox{. }   \\label{eq : finmf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this function has a bend at @xmath56 ; for lower @xmath47 , it behaves as @xmath57 , characteristic of dissolution by two - body relaxation , while for higher @xmath47 , it behaves as @xmath58 , independent of @xmath31 .",
    "thus , we expect only minor differences in the shapes of the gcmf between @xmath40 ( fz01 model ) and @xmath34 ( kpz09 model ) .",
    "the gcmf derived above is strictly valid only in the idealized case that all clusters in the gc system dissolve at the same rate @xmath37 . in reality",
    ", clusters with different internal densities , determined mainly by the galactic tidal field , will dissolve at different rates @xmath59 . in that case ,",
    "equation  ( [ eq : finmf ] ) can be re - interpreted as the probability density that an individual cluster with evaporation rate @xmath37 has a mass @xmath8 at an age @xmath20 .",
    "the gcmf of a system of @xmath60 coeval clusters is then the sum of the individual probability densities : @xmath61\\!\\!\\mbox{. }   \\label{eq : multi - mu - mf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath50 and @xmath51 are assumed to be the same for all clusters in the gc system , and the normalization factors @xmath62 must be chosen such that the integral over all @xmath8 is unity for each term in the sum .",
    "we now relate the evaporation rate @xmath37 of a cluster to its mean density @xmath63 within the half - mass radius @xmath64 as follows .",
    "the @xmath65-body simulations of @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bm03 ) showed that the dissolution time @xmath36 of a tidally limited cluster can be approximated by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the half - mass relaxation time and @xmath68 is the half - mass crossing time .",
    "the parameter @xmath41 in equation  ( [ eq : t_dis_bm03 ] ) is the same as that in equations  ( [ eq : dmdt])([eq : multi - mu - mf ] ) and measures the deviation of the dissolution time from the formula @xmath69 for classical evaporation . instead of @xmath31 in equation  ( [ eq : t_dis_bm03 ] ) .",
    "the difference between the two is negligible : @xmath70 and @xmath31 were derived by evaluating @xmath36 as functions of @xmath65 ( number of particles ) and the cluster mass @xmath8 , respectively ( see * ? ? ?",
    "] the extra factor of @xmath71 for retarded evaporation comes about because unbound stars take a finite time , proportional to @xmath72 , to cross a cluster before escaping from it . during that time",
    ", some of the unbound stars will be scattered back into bound orbits within the cluster , thus retarding its evaporation . from equations ( [ eq : t_dis_bm03 ] ) and ( [ eq : dmdt ] ) , we obtain @xmath73 independent of @xmath31 for both classical and retarded evaporation . in @xcite",
    "is related to our @xmath37 by @xmath74 . ]",
    "the evaporation rate of a cluster can also be expressed in terms of its mean density @xmath75 within the tidal radius @xmath76 .",
    "this density is determined largely by the tidal field at the pericenter @xmath77 of the orbit of the cluster within its host galaxy : @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath80 is the galactic circular velocity at @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that , while the densities @xmath63 and @xmath75 of gcs in the milky way span four or five orders of magnitude , the quantity @xmath81 varies by less than a factor of two .",
    "thus , to a good approximation , we can rewrite equation  ( [ eq : mu ] ) in the form @xmath82 in an idealized static and spherical galactic potential , the pericenters of all orbits remain fixed , and @xmath75 and hence @xmath37 are constants of motion .",
    "both fz01 and kpz09 computed the evaporation rates of clusters on different orbits from equation  ( [ eq : mu_v / r ] ) and then summed over a realistic distribution of orbits to determine the mass function @xmath83 of a gc system from equation  ( [ eq : multi - mu - mf ] ) or its integral equivalent .",
    "however , as @xcite pointed out , the only role of the orbits in this calculation is to determine the cluster densities , @xmath63 or @xmath84 , a step that can be eliminated by computing @xmath37 directly from the observed values of @xmath63 or @xmath75 . because tidal radii are notoriously uncertain , evaporation rates are much more robust when computed from @xmath63 than from @xmath75 .",
    "this is the approach we take in this paper .",
    "another simplification noted by @xcite is that the mass function @xmath83 of a gc system computed from equation ( [ eq : finmf ] ) with the median value of @xmath37 is very similar to that computed from equation ( [ eq : multi - mu - mf ] ) with a realistic distribution of @xmath37 ( see also kpz09 ) .",
    "we refer to the former as single-@xmath37 models and the latter as multiple-@xmath37 models . in this paper , we present results for both types of models , confirming their similarity .",
    "the model gcmfs described above assume that evaporation by two - body relaxation is the dominant disruption mechanism . as such , they neglect the effects of stellar evolution and gravitational shocks .",
    "mass loss by stellar evolution is dominated by supernovae and strong winds of massive stars in the first few @xmath85 years .",
    "this material is assumed to escape from clusters of all masses , thus leaving the shape of the gcmf unchanged .",
    "meanwhile , for surviving gcs in the milky way , fz01 showed that mass loss due to gravitational shocks is generally much weaker than that due to two - body relaxation for clusters with masses below the peak of the gcmf ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the rate of mass loss by gravitational shocks depends only on the densities @xmath63 of clusters , not their masses , which preserves the shape of the gcmf in the sense that both @xmath86 and @xmath8 are simply rescaled by time - dependent factors ( see fz01 ) .",
    "fitting equation  ( [ eq : finmf ] ) to the observed galactic gclf requires a conversion from luminosity to mass . for the fz01 model ( @xmath40 )",
    ", we simply adopt a mass - independent @xmath87 ratio . for the kpz09 model ( @xmath34 )",
    ", we use their relation between @xmath87 and @xmath88 at an age of 12 gyr .",
    "the corresponding parameters of the kpz09 model are : @xcite concentration parameter @xmath89 ( the median value of @xmath90 for the milky way gc system , @xcite ) , metallicity @xmath91 , and @xmath92 = 1.3 myr .",
    "the last of these parameters is defined in the kpz09 model as @xmath93 , i.e. , the dissolution timescale for a cluster with @xmath94 .",
    "the conversion to our notation is @xmath95 ( see equation  [ eq : dmdt ] ) .    we derive the observed gclf of the milky way from the 2010 version of the @xcite catalog of gc data . to avoid uncertain luminosities ,",
    "we exclude 17 gcs with @xmath96 , resulting in a catalog with 140 gcs .",
    "@xmath97-band luminosities are derived by assuming the standard galactic reddening law ( with @xmath98 ) and a solar absolute @xmath97-band magnitude of @xmath99 @xcite .    for the single-@xmath37 case , we perform least - squares fits of the model gclfs to the observed galactic gclf using the non - linear marquardt - levenberg algorithm @xcite .",
    "this is done for @xmath40 to represent the fz01 model and for @xmath34 to represent the kpz09 model .",

    ", we adopt the single-@xmath37 models for simplicity .",
    "it is worth noting that the gclfs of the fz01 and kpz09 models are more similar than are their gcmfs ( see fig .  1 of kpz09 ) .",
    "the reason for this is that the different relations between @xmath87 and @xmath88 largely compensate for the differences in the gcmfs .",
    "we conclude that the shape of the galactic gclf does not provide any evidence for a gc mass - dependent @xmath87 ratio .",

    "the most reliable estimates of gc masses are those derived from stellar kinematics , often referred to as `` dynamical masses '' .",
    "kpz09 argued that the dependence of @xmath22 on @xmath1 predicted by their model was supported by the dynamical masses compiled by @xcite who found a weak correlation between @xmath22 and @xmath8 due to a few high @xmath22 values at @xmath139 .",
    "however , no such correlation appears in the more homogeneous and larger compilation of @xmath22 values by @xcite , which superseded most of the @xcite  results . with this in mind , we review recent measurements of dynamical @xmath0 ratios of ancient gcs in the literature to search for any dependence on gc luminosity similar to that predicted by the kpz09 model .",
    "we test for a dependence of @xmath22 on gc luminosity rather than gc mass because the uncertainties in gc luminosities are typically relatively small and similar among clusters .",
    "in contrast , the uncertainties in gc masses vary significantly among clusters , depending on measurement specifics ( e.g. , numbers of stars measured , radial coverage ) .",

    "this trend is , in principle , roughly consistent with the predictions of the reference k09 model .",
    "however , it should also be noted that _ all _ gcs that are significantly depleted in low - mass stars relative to the most luminous gcs feature relatively low king concentration parameters ( @xmath212 , corresponding to @xmath213 ) . versus @xmath214 ( their fig .  1 ) .",
    "our fig .",
    "[ f : alphaplot1 ] illustrates the luminosity dependence of the difference in @xmath204 between gcs with high and low values of @xmath214 . ]",
    "conversely , all gcs with @xmath215 show @xmath204 values consistent with a @xcite imf , and thus do not show any significant trend of @xmath87 with @xmath88 .",
    "the latter does not seem consistent with the predictions of the reference k09 model for the galactic gc system as a whole , which adopted @xmath89 .",
    "however , the strong depletions of low - mass stars seen in gcs with low concentration indices can also be explained in a different way : @xcite argued that this observation may be caused by low - concentration gcs having started out as tidally limited clusters with relatively high levels of primordial mass segregation .",
    "the low - mass stars in such clusters would initially be located relatively close to the tidal radius , allowing their evaporation from the cluster to start well before the cluster experiences core collapse , thus leading to present - day mass functions that are relatively strongly depleted in low - mass stars . in this context",
    ", we also note that the @xmath65-body simulations by @xcite showed that gcs with low initial concentration index ( @xmath90 = 5 or 3 ) gradually evolve to higher concentration indices ( @xmath216 ) within 4070% of their dissolution time . as such , low - luminosity gcs with _",
    "current _ low concentration indices likely had even lower concentration indices initially , which might have caused the strong depletion of low - mass stars in such gcs to start even earlier than predicted by the @xcite study .",
    "this effect is not incorporated in the k09 models , rendering it hard to determine the reason for the significant difference in @xmath204 between gcs with low and high concentration indices without additional information .    in conclusion",
    ", the observed depletion of low - mass stars in low - luminosity gcs can be explained in more than one way and therefore is a weak or inconclusive test of the stellar mass dependence of the escape rate in the k09 models .",
    "hence our conclusions from the previous sections remain valid .",
    "the most promising explanation for the peaked shape of the observed luminosity function ( lf ) of old gcs is that it is a relic of dynamical processes  primarily stellar escape driven by internal two - body relaxation  operating on an initial power - law or schechter mf of young clusters over a hubble time .",
    "the semi - analytical models of fz01 showed quantitative agreement with the present - day observed gclf for a wide range of initial mf shapes . for the sake of simplicity , and based on theoretical and observational standard practice at the time , fz01 adopted an evaporation rate independent of cluster mass and a mass - to - light ratio independent of cluster mass .",
    "kpz09 challenged both of these assumptions .",
    "they claimed that the predicted gclf was only consistent with the observed gclf if the stellar evaporation rate depends significantly on cluster mass : @xmath217 with @xmath34 rather than @xmath40 for the fz01 model . to calculate the escape rates of stars of different masses and hence the variation of @xmath0 among clusters with different masses , they employed the semi - analytical model of k09 , which involves a significant number of plausible , but largely untested , assumptions and approximations .    in this paper",
    ", we performed a quantitative evaluation of the kpz09 claim that their model could fit the observed gclf while the fz01 model could not .",
    "we conclude that this claim is not valid , based on the following analysis and results .    1",
    ".   the fz01 and kpz09 models provide equally good fits to the observed gclf in the milky way . furthermore , both models yield a significantly better fit to the observed gclf at low luminosities than the traditional gaussian model , highlighting the importance of mass loss driven by two - body relaxation in shaping the gclf .",
    "the measured @xmath87 values of gcs in the milky way and the andromeda galaxy show no dependence on cluster luminosity . at low gc luminosities ( @xmath218 ) , where the impact of a stellar mass - dependent escape rate is expected to be strongest ,",
    "the observations are fitted better by a mass - independent @xmath87 than by the kpz09 model .",
    "this result holds for all six independent studies of gcs with dynamical @xmath87 data analyzed here .",
    "we find that the discrepancy between the observed @xmath87 data at low gc luminosities and the kpz09 predictions can not be resolved by increasing the characteristic dissolution timescale @xmath92 of the k09 model , since such an increase would yield an unacceptable fit to the gclf .",
    "in other words , there is no value of @xmath92 that allows the k09 model to fit simultaneously the gclf and the observed @xmath87 data at @xmath218 .",
    "the parameter @xmath34 adopted by kpz09 is based on results of @xmath65-body simulations of gcs with initial masses @xmath219 , whereas the initial masses of gcs that survive 12 gyr of dynamical evolution are at least one order of magnitude higher than that .",
    "theory indicates that the value of @xmath31 will increase toward unity at higher masses .",
    "thus , the appropriate value of @xmath31 for models of the gcmf and gclf evolution may be closer to 1.0 than to 0.7 .",
    "we emphasize again that we do not dispute the physical principles of retarded evaporation and @xmath22 variations .",
    "rather , we claim that these effects add substantially to the complexity of dynamical gcmf and gclf models and are not needed in practice to match observed gclfs .",
