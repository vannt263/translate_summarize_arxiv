    "the x - ray spectrum of the starburst galaxy m82 measured with _ asca _",
    "@xcite consists of soft , medium , and hard components @xcite",
    ". the hard component , which dominates the x - ray spectrum above 2 kev , was found to show time variability by monitoring m82 with _ asca _ in 1996 @xcite . assuming a distance of 3.9 mpc ( i.e. @xmath2 19 pc ) @xcite , its luminosity in the 0.5  10 kev band changed between 4.5 and 1.6 at various time scales from 1  s to a month .",
    "the most plausible explanation for the variability is that a low - luminosity agn exists in m82 .",
    "if this explanation is correct , m82 would be one of the most important objects for the study of a relation between an agn and starburst activity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) because of its proximity",
    ". however , hard x - ray spectra of m82 obtained with _ ginga _ and _ bepposax _ , which can detect the x - ray photons of higher energy than _ asca _ , differ from typical agn spectra , since they can not be fitted by a power - law model @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is also possible that the origin of the hard component is a new type of compact x - ray source .    furthermore , @xcite compared the _ asca _ image with the _ rosat _ hri image @xcite , and showed that the hard component probably comes from the x - ray brightest source detected with the _ rosat _ hri .",
    "the hri source was found to show time variability @xcite .",
    "since @xcite showed that the source is away from the dynamical center of m82 , this galaxy may harbor an `` off - center '' agn .",
    "thus , the source of the hard component of m82 would be a quite interesting and important object .",
    "for further investigation , it is necessary to determine the position of the hard component precisely and to find a counterpart in other wavelengths if possible .",
    "therefore , we analyzed the data of m82 obtained with the high - resolution camera ( hrc ) ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) onboard the _ chandra x - ray observatory ( cxo)_@xcite . the hrc has sensitivity in the 0.1  10 kev band with a peak at about 1 kev , and it has the highest angular resolution ( fwhm @xmath3 ) of all instruments onboard x - ray observatories to date .",
    "uncertainties in this paper refer to 1@xmath4 confidence limits .",
    "m82 was observed twice with _ cxo _ as a calibration target using the hrc - i on 1999 october 28 and 2000 january 20 .",
    "the hrc data were processed with the standard procedure by the _ chandra x - ray center ( cxc ) _ , and we used only the fully processed science products ( level = 2 ) as event files .",
    "we also applied an event screening procedure developed by the hrc team to eliminate `` ghost '' events .",
    "the exposure times are 2788  s for the first observation and 17684  s for the second .",
    "we found that all x - ray bright sources which can be the origin of the _ asca _ hard component exist within the central @xmath0 (= 1.1 kpc @xmath5 1.1 kpc ) region , which is shown in figure  [ fig : hrc ] .",
    "the position of the bright off - center source found with the _ rosat _ hri @xcite is also within the field .",
    "therefore , we concentrate on the central @xmath0 region . in figure",
    "[ fig : hrc ] , we see nine prominent sources , which are designated with circles and numbers .",
    "more detailed analysis including diffuse emission and other fainter sources will be presented in a forthcoming paper ( m. ward et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "we determined the positions of the peaks of the nine hrc sources with the wavelet algorithm using _ chandra interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) _ , and named the hrc sources by using these positions ( table  [ tbl : src ] ) .",
    "the position uncertainty is less than @xmath6 .    according to `` the _ cxc _ memo on astrometry problems , '' the hrc event files we used",
    "could have offsets up to @xmath7 in the celestial coordinates . to check the reliability of the coordinates in the event files , we compared the coordinates of the hrc sources with the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) point source catalog .",
    "there are 17 2mass sources in the field of figure  [ fig : hrc ] .",
    "according to the _ cxc _ , the offset of the celestial coordinate in ordinary cxo event files is @xmath8 ( rms ) .",
    "the position uncertainty in the 2mass catalog is @xmath6 . considering these uncertainties",
    ", we found that three 2mass sources out of 17 agree with the hrc sources ( nos .  1 , 6 , and 8) .",
    "since the probability of a chance coincidence is less than 0.1  % , we can assume that the hrc coordinates are reliable .",
    "we then compared the coordinates of the hrc sources with the 5  ghz sources @xcite whose position accuracy is @xmath3 .",
    "the fact that four hrc sources ( nos .",
    "4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 ) have counterparts on the 5  ghz map also supports the reliability of the hrc coordinates .",
    "the identifications of the hrc sources are shown in table  [ tbl : src ] .",
    "we estimated the counting rates of the hrc sources using the x - ray events within the circular regions shown in figure  [ fig : hrc ] .",
    "the backgrounds including the diffuse emission were estimated using source - free regions around the sources .",
    "the counting rates are listed in table  [ tbl : src ] .",
    "four hrc sources ( nos .  5 , 7 , 8 , and 9 ) show significant time variability",
    ". in particular , no .",
    "5 disappeared in the second observation , and no .",
    "7 became brighter by a factor of 7 .",
    "the counting rates of no .  1 and no .  4 did not change significantly between the two observations .",
    "the dynamical center at @xmath9 = @xmath10 , which is determined by the radio observation of the motion of gas , is shown as the green cross in figure  [ fig : hrc ] @xcite . the position error circle with a radius of @xmath11 is also shown as the green circle .",
    "we should note that all nine hrc sources are clearly away from the dynamical center .",
    "the counting rate of the dynamical center estimated with the extraction radius of @xmath11 is ( @xmath12 ) c s@xmath13 for 1999 october 28 , and ( @xmath14 ) c s@xmath13 for 2000 january 20 .",
    "thus , we found no significant source at the dynamical center .",
    "we estimated the hrc counting rate of the _ asca _ hard component @xcite using _",
    "v3.0 : the expected counting rate is 0.72 c s@xmath13 in the highest state and 9.7 c s@xmath13 in the lowest",
    ". only the counting rate of no .",
    "7 is consistent with the expected counting rate .",
    "furthermore , the position of the _ asca _ hard component is consistent with that of no .  7 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the variability of the _ asca _ hard component is due to no .",
    "7 ( ) . the separation between no .  7 and the dynamical center is @xmath1 ( @xmath15 170 pc )",
    "we found that 41.5 + 59.7 @xcite is a candidate of the radio counterpart of no .",
    "7 as well as 41.30 + 59.6 @xcite .",
    "41.5 + 59.7 is @xmath16 away from no .  7 , while the separation between 41.30 + 59.6 and no .",
    "7 is @xmath17 . according to the morphology and spectral shape in the 5  ghz radio band",
    ", @xcite suggested that 41.30 + 59.6 is a young supernova remnant ( snr ) .",
    "41.5 + 59.7 show a 100  % drop in the radio flux within a year , and its radio decay time scale and spectrum are very similar to sn  1983n @xcite .",
    "therefore , this source may also be a snr .",
    "the hard x - ray emission of m82 was found to show the short - term variability @xcite . since it is rather difficult to explain the short - term variability in terms of a snr origin , both radio sources may not be a real counterpart of no .",
    "7 .    if we assume the spectral shape of no .",
    "7 is an absorbed thermal bremsstrahlung model with a temperature of 10 kev and a column density of @xmath18 @xmath19 , which is the typical spectral shape of the _ asca _ hard component @xcite , the peak x - ray flux of no .",
    "7 is 6.6 in the 2  10 kev band . according to the the @xmath20 relation @xcite , the probability that a source as bright as no .",
    "7 exists in the @xmath0 field is @xmath15 0.3 % .",
    "therefore , no .  7 is probably not a background agn .",
    "the _ asca _",
    "spectrum of the variable source obtained by subtracting the spectrum of the lowest state from the highest state shows heavy absorption ( the column density is @xmath15 @xmath18  @xmath19 ) @xcite .",
    "since the galactic absorption toward m82 is 4  @xmath19 @xcite , the variable source is embedded deeply in m82 , and hence no .",
    "7 is probably not a foreground source , unless the source has extremely large intrinsic absorption .    assuming the absorbed bremsstrahlung model of 10 kev and @xmath18 @xmath19 , unabsorbed x - ray luminosity in the 0.5  10 kev band ( @xmath21 ) is expressed using an hrc counting rate ( @xmath22 ) as @xmath23.\\ ] ] the @xmath21 of no .",
    "7 was estimated to be 1.2 on 1999 october 28 and 8.7 on 2000 january 20 .",
    "if we assume that no .  7 is a black hole ( bh ) and that the maximum luminosity does not exceed the eddington luminosity , the mass of the bh must be larger than 700 @xmath24 , and no .  7 is not a stellar - mass bh ( @xmath15 10 @xmath24 ) . since no .",
    "7 is @xmath1 away from the dynamical center , the mass of no .",
    "7 must be much smaller than the gravitational mass within @xmath1 from the center which is 4 @xmath24 @xcite , otherwise the dynamical center would be shifted from the current position .",
    "therefore , no .  7",
    "is at the low end of the mass distribution of super - massive bhs ( @xmath25  @xmath26 @xmath24 ) or a medium - massive bh ( @xmath27  @xmath25 @xmath24 ) .",
    "the possibility of the medium - massive bh is discussed in detail in @xcite along with the discovery of an expanding molecular superbubble surrounding no .",
    "other possibilities such as an x - ray binary source whose jet is strongly beamed at us can not be excluded .",
    "further investigation including other wavelengths is strongly encouraged to reveal the true character of no .",
    "7 ( ) .      though we found no significant source at the dynamical center , it is still possible that a faint x - ray source such as sgr a@xmath28 exists @xcite .",
    "assuming an absorbed power - low model with a photon index of 1.7 and a column density of @xmath18 @xmath19 , the upper limit of @xmath21 of the dynamical center is 5.4 for 1999 october 28 and 1.3 for 2000 january 20 .",
