    "recently moving average processes have attained much attention , both from the theoretical and application side , since they provide a large class of processes , only partly belonging to the class of semimartingales and allowing to model correlation structures including long - range dependence .",
    "the theoretical foundations of treating moving average processes with driving lvy processes have been provided in rajput and rosinski ( 1989 ) and recently the question under which conditions these type of processes are semimartingales has been considered in basse and pedersen ( 2009 ) .",
    "a special case of lvy driven moving average processes are fractional lvy motions ( cf .",
    "benassi et.al ( 2004 ) and marquardt ( 2006 ) ) , where the kernel function of the fractional brownian motion is taken , leading to the same correlation structure as fractional brownian motion .",
    "bender et.al ( 2010 ) derived conditions on the driving lvy process and the exponent of the kernel function under which the fractional lvy motion is a semimartingale .",
    "it turns out that this can only be the case in the long memory setting and then the process is of finite variation .",
    "barndorff - nielsen and schmiegel ( 2009 ) developed the idea of moving average processes further by introducing a stochastic volatility component leading to brownian semi - stationary processes , which are a very promising class of processes for modelling turbulence .",
    "furthermore , these processes have also been applied to electricity modelling ( cf .",
    "barndorff - nielsen et.al ( 2010 ) ) .",
    "however , we can also view the well - known ornstein - uhlenbeck process as moving average process , which due to its simple structure is very popular for modelling mean reverting data ( e.g. barndorff - nielsen and shephard ( 2001 ) , klppelberg et.al ( 2009 ) ) .",
    "motivated by this we introduce an exponential kernel @xmath2 , namely it is of the order @xmath3 .",
    "in addition the range of the first - order autocorrelation of the increments is @xmath4 in contrast to @xmath5 for the ornstein - uhlenbeck process .",
    "positive values are often associated to long range dependence , but with the well - balanced ornstein - uhlenbeck process we see that this is not true .",
    "hence the well - balanced ornstein - uhlenbeck process might serve as a promising mean process in financial models , e.g. as additive component in stochastic volatility models , since it possesses the following desirable properties :    *   the decay of the autocorrelation function is of the order @xmath3 , *   the autocorrelation between increments can be positive and negative , depending on @xmath6 , *   it is a semimartingale , *   it has an infinitely divisible distribution .",
    "furthermore , as in barndorff - nielsen and shephard ( 2001 ) the well - balanced ornstein - uhlenbeck process might be used as volatility process in stochastic volatility models . since",
    "the relationship of cumulant transforms between price and volatility process only differs by a constant from the ornstein - uhlenbeck model , modelling of the marginals stay the same as in barndorff - nielsen and shephard ( 2001 ) .",
    "however , the different correlation structure of the well - balanced ornstein - uhlenbeck process is inherited by the integrated volatility and the squared price increments .",
    "in addition to the well - balanced ornstein - uhlenbeck process with the kernel given above we also introduce the process with the corresponding difference kernel @xmath7 definition of the well - balanced ornstein - uhlenbeck process ----------------------------------------------------------    as driving process we consider a lvy process @xmath8 given by the characteristic function @xmath9 with @xmath10 where the lvy measure @xmath11 satisfies the integrability condition @xmath12 .    in the following we give conditions on a kernel function @xmath13 such that processes of the form @xmath14 exist . here",
    "@xmath8 denotes the two - sided version of the lvy process which is defined in the straight forward way by taking two independent copies @xmath15 and @xmath16 and defining @xmath17    here and in the following we deal with stochastic integrals on the real line as well as on the positive half line .",
    "integrals on @xmath18 are meant in the sense of rajput and rosinski ( 1989 ) , i.e. we associate an independently scattered random measure @xmath19 with the two - sided lvy process @xmath8 . for details",
    "we refer the reader to sato ( 2004 ) ( in particular theorem 3.2 ) who even treats the more general case of additive processes in law on @xmath20 .",
    "the extension to @xmath18 is straightforward .",
    "@xmath19 is defined on the @xmath21-ring of bounded borel measurable sets in @xmath18 and the integral @xmath22 is introduced in a canonical way for deterministic step functions @xmath23 .",
    "a function @xmath24 is then called integrable if there exists a sequence @xmath25 of step functions such that    * @xmath26 a.s with respect to the lebesgue measure * @xmath27 exists for every @xmath28 .",
    "if a function @xmath24 is integrable , we write @xmath29 . from time to time",
    "we will switch between this integral and the classical it integral , namely in the case @xmath30 } f(s ) \\",
    ", dl_s=\\int_0^t f(s ) \\ , dl_s$ ] for @xmath31 .",
    "both integrals coincide for predictable integrands of the type @xmath32 .",
    "the general case follows by a standard argument using dominated convergence .",
    "before we specify the function @xmath33 let us first briefly look at the setting of a general kernel . rewriting the criteria of rajput and rosinski ( 1989 ) [ theorem 2.7 ] for the existence of the integral we obtain : the stochastic integral @xmath34 is well defined if for @xmath35 @xmath36 ( cf . in this context basse and pedersen ( 2009 ) equations ( 2.1)-(2.3 ) ) .",
    "then the characteristic function is given by @xmath37 and @xmath38 is infinitely divisible with characteristic triplet @xmath39 @xmath40 where @xmath41 denotes lebesgue measure .",
    "furthermore for @xmath42 and @xmath43 we obtain @xmath44 if we now consider kernels of the form @xmath45 the resulting process @xmath46 is stationary since for every @xmath47 @xmath48 in particular it possesses stationary increments . if we consider kernels of the form @xmath49 we have @xmath50 a.s .",
    "and stationary increments where the increments have the same distribution as the increments of the process generated by the kernel @xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath51 and the second moment of @xmath8 exists and the first one vanishes , we denote @xmath52 , then @xmath38 also exists in the @xmath53-sense with isometry @xmath54 as shown in marquardt ( 2006)[prop .",
    "now we can come back to our special cases and assume @xmath55 .",
    "for the well - balanced ornstein - uhlenbeck process the kernel is @xmath56 from this reformulation we can see why we call the process well - balanced ornstein - uhlenbeck process , namely @xmath57 which is analogous to the well - balanced fractional lvy motion ( cf . marquardt ( 2006 ) [ definition 3.1 ] ) . following the terminology of samorodnitsky and taqqu ( 1994 ) [ example 3.6.4 ] in the stable case it is the sum of an ornstein - uhlenbeck process and a reverse ( or fully anticipating ) ornstein - uhlenbeck process .",
    "the initial distribution of @xmath58 is given by @xmath59 as for the fractional kernel we can construct processes with stationary increments starting from zero , which for the well - balanced ornstein - uhlenbeck process leads to @xmath60 now we can provide the characteristic triplet of the process @xmath58 .",
    "the well - balanced ornstein - uhlenbeck process @xmath61 is well - defined and infinitely divisible with characteristic triplet @xmath62 @xmath63 if and only if @xmath55 and @xmath64 .",
    "the result follows by straight forward calculations from the general formulae .",
    "here we see that in contrast to fractional lvy motions the well - balanced ornstein - uhlenbeck process is well - defined with only imposing the condition of a logarithmic moment of the driving lvy process .",
    "since the processes @xmath58 and @xmath65 differ only by a random variable which does not depend on @xmath35 , in the following we only treat @xmath58 . however , the results remain valid for @xmath65 .",
    "we will show that @xmath66 is a process of finite variation on compacts and hence a semimartingale with respect to any filtration it is adapted to . in order to do this we introduce the following decomposition @xmath67 and write the last term as @xmath68 for reference purposes we write the above representation of @xmath66 in a short form @xmath69 using the following notation : @xmath70 and @xmath71    from above and i.4.36 in jacod and shiryaev ( 2003 ) we obtain : @xmath72 for every @xmath35 .",
    "this means the process is continuous , though the driving term exhibits jumps .",
    "the following theorem refines this result .",
    "the process @xmath66 is of finite variation on compacts and hence it is a semimartingale with respect to _ any _ filtration it is adapted to .",
    "furthermore the process is locally lipschitz continuous .",
    "first we use the integration - by - parts formula on @xmath73 and @xmath74 and obtain @xmath75 respective @xmath76 putting these together we have @xmath77 this means we end up with a pathwise integration of functions which are a.s . locally bounded since they are cdlg .",
    "in particular the process is locally lipschitz and of finite variation on compacts .",
    "note that this is different to the classical ornstein - uhlenbeck process which inherits the jump property from the driving process .",
    "in basse and pedersen ( 2009 ) and bender et.al ( 2010 ) the authors treat the case of other kernel functions . however , their conditions on the lvy process are more restrictive .",
    "note that by jacod and shiryaev ( 2003 ) proposition i.4.24 the process @xmath66 , since it does not have jumps , is even a special semimartingale with respect to every filtration it is adapted to . for the remainder of the paper we fix the filtration @xmath78 which is obtained by defining first @xmath79 via @xmath80 . which is completed and made right continuous in the usual way to obtain @xmath78 .",
    "since the process is continuous and of finite variation on compacts we obtain the following corollary by the general representation of semimartingales ( cf .",
    "jacod and shiryaev ( 2003 ) theorem ii.2.34 ) .",
    "the semimartingale characteristics of the process @xmath58 are @xmath81 .",
    "a different approach leads to another perspective on the well - balanced ornstein - uhlenbeck process .",
    "the process @xmath58 can be represented as an arma process in continuous time , i.e. a carma process ( cf .",
    "brockwell and lindner ( 2009 ) ) .",
    "in general such a process , possibly complex valued , is given by @xmath82 where @xmath83 and the @xmath84-valued stochastic process @xmath85 is given as the solution of the sde @xmath86 where @xmath87 are complex - valued coefficients and @xmath8 is a driving lvy process . the @xmath88-matrix is usually denoted by @xmath89 . in our case",
    "we have @xmath90 the sde for the well - balanced lvy driven ornstein - uhlenbeck process is @xmath91 with the explicit solution @xmath92 here @xmath93 is not meant componentwise but in the sense of bounded operators , i.e. as a convergent series of matrices . by choosing the initial conditions appropriately , i.e. @xmath94 we get our process @xmath58 as a stationary carma(2,0 ) process . for criteria for carma processes to be stationary compare brockwell and lindner ( 2009 ) [ theorem 3.3 ] .",
    "summarizing we can see that though integrating with respect to a quite general lvy process the special very regular form of the kernel leads to a semimartingale of bounded variation .",
    "hence the well - balanced ornstein - uhlenbeck process might serve as mean process in the framework of semimartingale models , e.g. stochastic volatility models in finance .",
    "in this section we will analyze the correlation structure of the well - balanced ornstein - uhlenbeck process .",
    "we will see that though the process is closely related to the stationary version of an ornstein - uhlenbeck process the two - sided kernel leads to a different behaviour in the autocorrelation function , namely to a decay of the order @xmath3 , and to a bigger range of possible values as in classical ornstein - uhlenbeck process , including positive ones , in the first order autocorrelation of increments .",
    "let @xmath95 and assume that the driving lvy process possesses a finite second moment .",
    "we denote the variance of @xmath96 by @xmath97 and the first moment by @xmath98 , then we obtain the following characteristic quantities for @xmath58 and @xmath47 @xmath99    from the general form of the characteristic function , we can calculate the second moment of @xmath100 , provided that @xmath8 possesses a second moment and both @xmath101 and @xmath102 are integrable .",
    "we obtain @xmath103 in the following we denote @xmath104 and @xmath105 . using this together with the independent increment property of @xmath8 , we obtain for @xmath95 and @xmath106 @xmath107    hence @xmath108    comparing this to the well known quantities of a stationary ornstein - uhlenbeck process @xmath109 we see , while the mean and the variance only differ by a multiple of two , the auto - covariance and autocorrelation function have an extra term leading to a slower decay , when the same @xmath6 is considered .",
    "this might be an interesting feature for modelling data , especially coming from finance , where a pure exponential decay often seem too fast to match the empirical autocorrelation properly .",
    "if we define the well - balanced ornstein - uhlenbeck process with time scaled by @xmath6 , i.e. @xmath110 this has the same effect as in barndorff - nielsen and shephard ( 2001 ) , that the marginal distribution and hence the moments are independent of @xmath6 .",
    "also the correlation between increments might be of interest for modelling purposes and follows by direct calculations from the proposition above .",
    "assume the same conditions on @xmath8 as in the previous proposition , then we obtain @xmath111 and as a special case the first - order autocorrelation @xmath112    note that in contrast to the classical ornstein - uhlenbeck process whose autocorrelation function of increments @xmath113 is always negative in the range between -0.5 and 0 , we can have positive and negative values , in the range from -0.5 to 1 depending on @xmath6 for the well - balanced ornstein - uhlenbeck process .",
    "looking for example at the first - order autocorrelation @xmath114 it is positive for @xmath115 and negative for bigger values of @xmath6 .",
    "this provides much more flexibility for modelling , e.g. we can obtain values for the first - order autocorrelation which is often linked to long - range dependence . assuming that @xmath116 denotes a fractional brownian motion with hurst parameter @xmath117 , then by kettani and gubner ( 2006 ) @xmath118 where @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "hence we can see that as the first - order autocorrelation of the well - balanced ornstein - uhlenbeck process @xmath121 and @xmath122 for @xmath123 .    for some applications it might of course be more realistic not to have a stationary process , but a process with stationary increments like lvy processes . in the context of well - balanced ornstein - uhlenbeck processes",
    "we can construct processes with the same correlation structure of increments and the same paths regularity by considering the associated difference kernel .",
    "let @xmath124 and assume that the driving lvy process possesses a finite second moment .",
    "we denote the variance by @xmath97 and the first moment by @xmath98 , then we obtain the following characteristic quantities for @xmath65 @xmath125    the proof follows immediately by noting that @xmath126 .    note",
    "that we can easily also construct a process which only possess this correlation structure for a specific lag and is zero for larger lags . for a kernel on a compact interval",
    "@xmath127 $ ] we obtain the process @xmath128 which possesses the second moment @xmath129 , assuming for simplicity that the first moment of @xmath96 is zero and the second 1 .",
    "furthermore for increments @xmath130 we obtain @xmath131 if @xmath132 and if @xmath133 : @xmath134 .",
    "this leads to @xmath135 for @xmath132 and 0 otherwise .",
    "we apply the well - balanced ornstein - uhlenbeck process to an example of real data and show that the autocorrelation models the empirical autocorrelation quite well .",
    "hence this indeed offers the possibility of adding the well - balanced ornstein - uhlenbeck process @xmath58 as an empirically convincing mean process to a classical stochastic volatility model , i.e. for the log - price process @xmath136 , where @xmath137 denotes a volatility process , @xmath138 a brownian motion and @xmath139 a jump lvy process .",
    "first we consider one trading day of the sap share , namely of 1st february 2006 9:00 am to 5:30 pm consisting of 5441 trades .",
    "the picture shows the empirical autocorrelation function as solid line , the dashed line is the fit with a classical ornstein - uhlenbeck process and the dotted line with the well - balanced ornstein - uhlenbeck process .",
    "we can see that the autocorrelation function both visually and by taking the residual sum of squares fits the data much better than the ornstein - uhlenbeck process , except for small lags .",
    "this might be interpreted as the effects of market microstructure .",
    "namely the two kinks in the empirical curve are at a lag of 75 and 150 respectively . in this setting",
    "this correspond to a sampling frequency of 7 minutes and 14 minutes .",
    "values in this range are in the econometrics literature often seen as sampling frequencies from which market microstructure effects start to be negligible .",
    "we have also included the volatility signature plot for the one trading day of 1st february 2006 , i.e. the realized volatility @xmath140 plotted with decreasing sampling frequency .",
    "it shows the presence of market microstructure when the realized volatility increases with increasing sampling frequency . for the sap data we can see indeed this effect , which vanishes above roughly 150 , but possesses an additional peak at about 80 .",
    "if we start fitting the empirical data only for larger lags than 150 , the values of @xmath6 and the rss for the ornstein - uhlenbeck process stay the same , whereas the rss of the well - balanced ornstein - uhlenbeck processes decreases to @xmath141 .",
    "furthermore , we also examined different data sets , namely tick - by - tick data of the daimler chrysler share and the siemens share of january 2005 .",
    "fitting the empirical autocorrelation with the autocorrelation function of the well - balanced ornstein - uhlenbeck process and the ornstein - uhlenbeck process up to a lag of 1000 , the well - balanced ornstein - uhlenbeck did better on 17 of the 21 trading days for daimler chrysler and on 13 for siemens .",
    "hence for single days the well - balanced ornstein - uhlenbeck process provides a good alternative . for averaged data",
    "the situation is a bit different . when averaging of the trading days the well - balanced ornstein - uhlenbeck process performed better than the ornstein - uhlenbeck process for daimler chrysler and worse for siemens . especially for small lags the ornstein - uhlenbeck process seems to fit very well as",
    "averaging smoothes away the kinks in the empirical curves of the single days .",
    "in this section we examine how the well - balanced ornstein - uhlenbeck process might serve as volatility process in a stochastic volatility model along the lines of the non - gaussian ornstein - uhlenbeck models of barndorff - nielsen and shephard ( 2001 ) .",
    "the well - balanced ornstein - uhlenbeck process leads to a model which is as tractable as the ornstein - uhlenbeck model but possesses some new features , namely that the different decay of the autocorrelation function is inherited by the decay of the autocorrelation of increments of integrated volatility and the autocorrelation of squared log - returns .    as in barndorff - nielsen and shephard ( 2001 )",
    "we consider the stochastic volatility model of the type @xmath142 we assume @xmath143 , @xmath138 denotes a brownian motion and @xmath58 the spot volatility process given by @xmath144 with @xmath55 and @xmath8 a two - sided lvy process .",
    "we assume that the law of @xmath96 is self - decomposable and restricted to the positive half line and the cumulant generating function is given by @xmath145 where @xmath11 denotes the lvy measure and the first two moments of @xmath96 exist .",
    "we denote the first moment by @xmath98 and the variance by @xmath97 .",
    "the time scale @xmath146 in the definition of @xmath58 ensures that the marginal law is independent of @xmath6 and the support of @xmath11 that @xmath58 is non - negative as required for a volatility process .",
    "similarly as for the characteristic function in section 2 also the cumulant transform @xmath147 of @xmath58 can be expressed in terms of the kernel and the cumulant transform of the underlying lvy process , namely @xmath148 from this we obtain that the n - th cumulant @xmath149 of the underlying lvy process is related to the n - th cumulant @xmath150 of @xmath58 by @xmath151 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath11 possesses a lebesgue density @xmath23 , also @xmath152 possesses a lebesgue density @xmath153 or respectively @xmath154 .",
    "this implies that the results differ only by 2 and 0.5 from the formulae of the ornstein - uhlenbeck processes respectively , hence modelling of the marginals is the same .",
    "next by direct calculation we can provide an explicit formula for the integrated volatility @xmath155 where @xmath156 .",
    "hence we can see that we have the additional terms @xmath157 compared to the formula of the ornstein - uhlenbeck process which is provided in barndorff - nielsen and shephard ( 2001 ) .",
    "finally we would like to note that the correlation structure of @xmath58 is inherited by the integrated volatility and the squared returns . by the general formulae provided in barndorff - nielsen and shephard ( 2001 ) we obtain for @xmath158 setting @xmath159 @xmath160 where for @xmath35 @xmath161.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    * acknowledgements . *",
