    "recently , a remarkably sharp dip has been observed around 2870 mhz in the odmr with zero applied magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the odmr results observed in @xcite can not be well reproduced by such a fitting @xcite , and no theoretical model can explain the dip until a new approach is suggested in @xcite .",
    "the model described in @xcite contains spin-1 properties of the nv@xmath0 centers while most of the previous models assume the nv@xmath0 center to be a spin - half system . by including the strain distributions , randomized magnetic fields , and homogeneous width of the nv@xmath0 centers ,",
    "the sharp dip in the odmr has been reproduced in @xcite . moreover ,",
    "this dip is shown to be the cause of a long - lived collective dark state observed in a spectroscopy of superconductor diamond hybrid system , and so this dip could be useful if we will use the collective dark state for a long - lived quantum memory of a superconducting qubit @xcite .    in this paper , we present the details about how the model suggested in @xcite can be applied to investigate the properties of an ensemble of nv@xmath0 centers .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we explain the experimental setup . in section 3",
    ", we introduce the theoretical model introduced in @xcite . in section 4",
    ", we show the odmr results and explain how these experimental results can be reproduced by our theoretical model .",
    "finally , section 5 contains a summary of our results .",
    "we begin by describing how we generate the nv@xmath0 centers in diamond . to create the nv@xmath0 center ensemble , we performed ion implantation of @xmath1c@xmath2 and we annealed the sample in high vacuum @xcite .",
    "the density of the nv@xmath0 centers is approximately @xmath3 @xmath4 , and we have the nv@xmath0 centers over the depth of 1@xmath5 m from the surface of the diamond .     center consists of a nitrogen atom ( n ) and a vacancy ( v ) in the adjacent site . since nv@xmath0 center is a spin-1 system , we have three states of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "we can characterize the nv@xmath0 center by an optically detected magnetic resonance ( odmr ) spectrum , and we perform the odmr with an applied magnetic field of @xmath9 mt , along the [ 111 ] direction . ]    the odmr was performed on the diamond sample by a confocal microscope with a magnetic resonance system at room temperature @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field of @xmath10 , @xmath11 , or @xmath12 mt was applied along the [ 111 ] axis . with zero or weak applied magnetic field ,",
    "a quantization axis of the nv@xmath0 center is determined by the direction from the vacancy to the nitrogen , which we call an nv@xmath0 axis .",
    "this axis is along one of four possible crystallographic axes .",
    "the nv@xmath0 centers usually occupy these four directions equally .",
    "the applied magnetic field along [ 111 ] is aligned with one of these four axes as shown in fig .",
    "[ config ] . in this case , the zeeman splitting of the nv@xmath0 centers having the nv@xmath0 axis of [ 111 ] is larger than that of the nv@xmath0 centers having the other three nv@xmath0 axes .",
    "we describe the model to simulate the odmr of the nv@xmath0 center ensemble , which was introduced in @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the nv@xmath0 centers is as follows .    in a rotating frame defined by @xmath13",
    ", we can perform the rotating wave approximation , and we obtain the simplified hamiltonian .",
    "@xmath14 if the number of excitations in the spin ensemble is much smaller than the number of spins , we can consider the spin ensemble as a number of harmonic oscillators . in this case , we can replace the spin ladder operators as creational operators of the harmonic oscillators such as @xmath15 , @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 . by using this approximation , we can simplify the hamiltonian as follows @xcite .",
    "@xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "the inhomogeneous broadening can be included in this model as following .",
    "we use lorentzian distributions to include an inhomogeneous effect of @xmath24 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the lorentzian distributions have been typically used to describe the inhomogeneous broadening of the nv@xmath0 centers @xcite . for an inhomogeneous magnetic field @xmath25",
    ", we need to consider the following two effect .",
    "first , since there is an electron spin - half bath in the environment due to the centers , nv@xmath0 centers are affected by randomized magnetic fields .",
    "second , a hyperfine coupling of the nitrogen nuclear spin splits the energy of the nv@xmath0 center into three levels .",
    "so we use a random distribution of the magnetic fields with the form of the mixture of three lorentzian functions . here , each peak of the lorentzian is separated with @xmath26 mhz that corresponds to the hyperfine interaction with nuclear spin @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , since the frequency shift of @xmath27 is almost two - orders of magnitude smaller than that of @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xcite , we consider the effect of inhomogeneity of @xmath27 as this order in this paper .",
    "we can describe the dynamics of the nv@xmath0 centers by using the heisenberg equation as follows .",
    "@xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the homogeneous width of the nv center .",
    "we assume that the initial state is a vacuum state . since we consider a steady state after a long time",
    ", we can set the time derivative as zero . in this condition",
    ", we obtain @xmath32 @xmath33    in the actual experiment , if we excite the nv@xmath0 centers by the microwave pulses , the intensity of the photons emitted from the nv@xmath0 centers will be changed from",
    "mhz ( hwhm ) , @xmath34 mhz ( hwhm ) , @xmath35 mhz ( hwhm ) , @xmath36 mhz , @xmath37 mhz .",
    "also , we assume a nitrogen hyperfine coupling of @xmath38 mhz . the red line denotes a numerical simulation and blue dots denote the experimental results . ]    .",
    "the red line denotes a numerical simulation and blue dots denote the experimental results . ]    .",
    "the red line denotes a numerical simulation and blue dots denote the experimental results . ]    by using the model described above , we have reproduced the odmr signals when we apply @xmath9 mt , as shown in figs [ zero ] , [ onemt ] , and [ twomt ] . a sharp dip is observed around @xmath39 mhz for the case of @xmath40 mt , and our simulation can reproduce this .",
    "two peaks are observed in the odmr with zero applied magnetic field as shown in fig [ zero ] , which corresponds to the transition between the state .",
    "if we consider a single nv@xmath0 center , the frequency difference between the two exited states is @xmath41 .",
    "since we consider an ensemble of the nv@xmath0 center , this frequency difference variates depending on the position of the nv@xmath0 center . for simplicity",
    ", we use a dimensionless variable for @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , defined as @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes a damping rate with an unit of the frequency . to calculate a probability that",
    "the are degenerate ( @xmath49 ) , we define probability density functions of @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 as @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "the joint probability is calculated as @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 denote a finite range of each variable .",
    "we assume @xmath60 because these are independent . by using spherical coordinates where @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 with @xmath64 , we rewrite this as @xmath65 this shows that , even if we consider a finite range @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , the probability for the two energy to be exactly degenerate ( @xmath66 ) is zero .",
    "this means that , if homogeneous broadening is negligible , the two peaks to denote the two energy of each nv@xmath0 center should be always separated in the odmr so that the odmr signal at the frequency of @xmath67 mhz should be the same as the base line .",
    "however , due to the effect of the homogeneous broadening , small signals deviated from the base line can be observed at the frequency of @xmath67 mhz .",
    "this is the cause of the sharp dip observed around the frequency of @xmath68 mhz in the odmr .    with an applied magnetic field",
    ", four peaks are observed in the odmr where two of them are larger than the other two , as shown in figs [ onemt ] and [ twomt ] .",
    "the two smaller peaks correspond to the energy of the nv@xmath0 centers with an nv@xmath0 axe along [ 111 ] , which is aligned with the applied magnetic field .",
    "a quarter of the nv@xmath0 centers in the ensemble have such an nv@xmath0 axis .",
    "the other larger peaks come from the other nv@xmath0 centers where the applied magnetic field is not aligned with the nv@xmath0 axis .",
    "three - quarters nv@xmath0 center have such axes . in this case , the zeeman splitting of these is smaller than that of the nv@xmath0 centers with the [ 111 ] axis .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a small dip is observed in the 1mt odmr around @xmath68 mhz due to the mechanism explained above . on the other hand ,",
    "such a dip is not clearly observed in the 2mt odmr , because the nv@xmath0 centers are considered to be as approximate two - level systems in this regime .",
    "we perform a numerical simulation with several parameters to understand the behavior of the sharp dip . in the fig [ zeroebg ] a , we change the parameter @xmath69 while we fix the other parameters .",
    "similarly , in the fig [ zeroebg ] b ( c ) , we change the parameter @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) while we fix the other parameters .",
    "we have found that the sharp dip is very sensitive against the change in @xmath69 , while the dip is relatively insensitive against the change in @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "axis denotes the microwave frequency , @xmath73 axis denotes @xmath74 ( for the figure a ) or @xmath75 ( for the figure b ) or @xmath76 ( for the figure c ) , and @xmath77 axis denotes the odmr signal intensity .",
    "other than the inhomogeneous width of the inhomogeneous width , we use the same parameters as the fig . [ zero ] .",
    "]    also , we perform a numerical simulation with several parameters for the odmr with an applied magnetic field . in the figs [ bb ] , we have plotted one of the peaks of the odmr with an applied magnetic field of 2mt .",
    "this peak corresponds to a transition between @xmath6 and @xmath78 of the nv@xmath0 center with an axis of [ 111 ] .",
    "axis denotes the microwave frequency , @xmath73 axis denotes @xmath76 for the left figure while @xmath73 axis denotes @xmath79 for the right figure , and @xmath77 axis denotes the odmr signal intensity .",
    "other than @xmath80 or @xmath75 , we use the same parameters as the fig .",
    "[ twomt ] . ]    from the numerical simulations , we have found that this odmr signals with applied magnetic field is robust against the strain variations @xmath71 , while the peak will be broadened due to the effect of the randomized magnetic field @xmath70 .",
    "the frequency difference between the ground state and can be calculated as @xmath81 .",
    "if the applied magnetic field is large , we obtain @xmath82 .",
    "this means that the effect of the strain is insignificant in this regime while the inhomogeneous magnetic field from the environment can easily change this frequency .",
    "these can explain the simulation results shown in figs [ bb ] such an effect to suppress the strain distributions by an applied magnetic field was mentioned in @xcite , and was recently demonstrated in a vacuum rabi oscillation between a superconducting flux qubit and nv@xmath0 centers in @xcite .",
    "our results here are consistent with these previous results",
    ".      an ensemble of nv@xmath0 centers is affected by inhomogeneous magnetic fields , inhomogeneous strain distributions , and homogeneous broadening . in the odmr ,",
    "the observed peaks contain the information of the total width that is a composite effect of three noise mentioned above , and so it was not straightforward to separate these three effects for the estimation about how individual noise contributes to the width .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied an odmr with a high - density ensemble of nv@xmath0 centers . our model succeeds to reproduce the odmr with and without applied magnetic field .",
    "also , we have shown that our model is useful to determine the typical parameters of the ensemble nv@xmath0 centers such as strain distributions , inhomogeneous magnetic fields , and homogeneous broadening width .",
    "such a parameter estimation is essential for the use of nv@xmath0 centers to realize diamond - based quantum information processing .      here , we consider the effect of inhomogeneous microwave amplitude .",
    "if we have such an inhomogeneity , by solving the heisenberg equation , we obtain @xmath83 where the value of @xmath84 differs depending on the position of the nv@xmath0 centers .",
    "if we define an average probability of the nv@xmath0 center in the bright ( dark ) state as @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) , we obtain @xmath87 since inhomogeneity of @xmath84 is independent from the inhomogeneity of @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , we can rewrite these probabilities for a large number of nv@xmath0 centers as follows @xmath92 @xmath93 where @xmath94 therefore , we obtain @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the probability of the nv@xmath0 center in the ground states can be calculated as @xmath98 and this is the same form as the probability of the homogeneous microwave amplitude case described in the eq .",
    "( [ probabilitye ] ) where @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) is replaced by @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "so the inhomogeneous microwave amplitude does not affect the theoretical prediction of odmr signals ."
