    "since the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite suffers from the @xmath3-problem @xcite and the little hierarchy problem , some non - minimal supersymmetric models have recently attracted much attention , among which the most intensively studied is the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) @xcite . in the nmssm",
    "there is no dimensionful parameters in the supersymmetry - conserving sector and the @xmath3 term is dynamically generated through the coupling between the two higgs doublets and a newly introduced singlet higgs field which develops a vacuum expectation value of the order of the susy breaking scale .",
    "the nmssm provides two ways to alleviate the little hierarchy problem .",
    "one is to relax the lep ii lower bound on the mass of the sm - like higgs boson , @xmath6 , by diluting @xmath7 coupling through the singlet component of @xmath6 and/or by suppressing the visible decay @xmath8 through introducing new decay of @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the other is to push up the higgs boson mass with a large @xmath0 , which can be seen from the tree level upper bound of the higgs boson mass @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath0 is the mixing parameter between the singlet and doublet higgs fields defined in eq.([superpotential ] ) .",
    "note that the choice of a large @xmath0 to solve the little hierarchy may be limited by the perturbativity of the theory at the scale @xmath12 since the value of @xmath0 is increasing with the energy scale@xcite . if this scale @xmath12 is the grand unification ( gut ) scale , @xmath0 should be less than about 0.7 at weak scale , leading to an upper bound on the higgs boson mass of about 150 gev @xcite . however , the bound on @xmath0 from the perturbativity consideration can be relaxed by embedding the nmssm in some more complex frameworks .",
    "for example , in the fat higgs model @xcite , by completing the nmssm ( or nmssm - like models ) with an appropriate strong dynamics at an intermediate scale ( much lower than the gut scale ) , @xmath0 can be as large as 2 at weak scale and the higgs boson mass can be pushed up to about 400 gev . in this work ,",
    "regardless the detailed forms of the ultraviolet physics , we treat the nmssm as an effective theory and examine the current experimental constraints on its parameter space .",
    "such phenomenological studies on the higgs boson and supersymmetry are pressing since the mystery of the higgs sector will be unveiled at the lhc in the near future .",
    "if the sm - like higgs boson is discovered with a mass above the mssm upper bound , the nmssm ( or other nmssm - like models ) with a large @xmath0 , generally called @xmath0susy @xcite , will be immediately favored since it not only inherits all the advantages of the mssm , such as unifying gauge couplings and providing a dark matter candidate , but also is free from the @xmath3-problem and the little hierarchy problem .",
    "for the phenomenological studies of these models , a primary work is to examine the current experimental constraints on their parameter space .",
    "we note that various constraints on the nmssm have been studied in the literature , but different constraints were considered in different papers .",
    "for example , in @xcite the authors mainly considered the lep ii constraints and put emphasize on small @xmath0 case .",
    "the package nmssmtools @xcite encoded various constraints ( like the lep ii searches for the higgs boson , the cosmic dark matter and the stability of the higgs potential ) , but it is still not complete since it does not include the indirect constraints from precision electroweak measurements and the muon anomalous magnetic moment . in this work",
    "we consider all these constraints and especially focus on the case with a large @xmath0 .",
    "as will be shown from our study , with the increase of @xmath0 , the parameter space is getting more stringently constrained . to figure out the allowed parameter space is helpful for exploring such low energy supersymmetry at the lhc and",
    "also may shed some light on constructing the ultraviolet physics from the bottom - up view .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we briefly describe the structure of the nmssm with emphasis on its difference from the mssm . in sec.iii",
    "we summarize the constraints considered in this work and briefly discuss their characters . in sec .",
    "iv we scan over the nmssm parameter space and display the region allowed by all these constraints . in sec .",
    "v we give our conclusions .",
    "the nmssm extends the matter fields of the mssm by adding one gauge singlet superfield @xmath13 , and its superpotential takes the form @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are squark superfields , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are slepton superfields , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are higgs doublet superfields . the soft susy breaking terms are given by @xmath22 note that just like the mssm , the nmssm has the feature that susy breaking induces the electroweak symmetry breaking . before susy breaking ( i.e. without the soft breaking terms ) ,",
    "the higgs scalars have zero vevs in the supersymmetric vacuum of the scalar potential and thus the electroweak symmetry is not broken .",
    "after susy breaking ( i.e. with the soft breaking terms ) , the higgs scalars develop non - zero vevs in the physical ( non - supersymmetric ) vacuum of the scalar potential and hence the electroweak symmetry is spontaneously broken and the @xmath3 parameter is generated @xmath23 .",
    "since both the electroweak symmetry breaking and the @xmath3 parameter generation are induced by susy breaking , their scales should be naturally at the susy breaking scale ( the scale of soft breaking mass parameters ) .",
    "the differences of the nmssm and mssm come from the higgs sector and the neutralino sector@xcite . in the higgs sector of the nmssm",
    "there are three cp - even and two cp - odd higgs bosons . in the basis",
    "@xmath24 $ ] , the mass - squared matrix elements for cp - even higgs bosons are @xmath25 in the basis @xmath26 $ ] with @xmath27 , the mass - squared matrix elements for the cp - odd higgs bosons are @xmath28 as shown in eq.([ma ] ) , we can choose @xmath29 instead of @xmath30 as a free parameter .",
    "so compared with the mssm , the nmssm has three additional parameters : @xmath0 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "conventionally , @xmath0 is chosen to be positive while @xmath31 and @xmath32 can be either positive or negative .",
    "note that eqs.([cp - even ] ) and ( [ cp - odd ] ) indicate that the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 affect the mixings between doublet and singlet higgs fields , while @xmath32 only affects the squared - mass of the singlet higgs field .    in the neutralino sector ,",
    "the nmssm predicts one extra neutralino . in the basis",
    "@xmath35 the neutralino mass matrix is given by @xcite @xmath36 this mass matrix is independent of @xmath32 , and the role of @xmath0 is to introduce the mixings of @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is to affect the mass of @xmath41 . from eq.([cp - even],[cp - odd],[mass matrix ] ) one can learn that in the limit @xmath42 , the singlet field have no mixing with the doublet field and thus is decoupled . in this case , the nmssm can recover the mssm .",
    "before we proceed to discuss experimental constraints on the parameters of the nmssm , we take a look at the bounds on @xmath0 and @xmath31 from the requirement that the theory should keep perturbative under a certain scale @xmath12 .",
    "the renormalization group equations ( rges ) for @xmath0 and @xmath31 under the scale @xmath12 take the following form @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the @xmath46 and @xmath47 gauge couplings .",
    "these rges indicate that the values of @xmath0 and @xmath31 increase with the energy scale .",
    "the requirement of perturbativity till the cut - off scale @xmath12 , i.e. , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , will set upper bounds on @xmath0 and @xmath31 at weak scale ( throughout this paper , without specification all input parameters are defined at weak scale ) .",
    "for example , if we assume that new dynamics appears at @xmath50tev , we get @xmath51 and for @xmath52 , @xmath31 must be less than 1.2 ; while if @xmath12 is chosen to be the gut scale , a stringent bound @xmath53 is obtained @xcite . in our following numerical study",
    "we let @xmath0 and @xmath31 to vary below 2 and 1 , respectively , and this corresponds to set @xmath54 tev .    in our study",
    "we consider the following constraints on the parameters of the nmssm :    * constraints on the neutralino and chargino sector , which include : the bound from invisible @xmath55 decay @xmath56 mev ; the upper bounds on neutralino pair productions at lep ii @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) and @xmath59 ; and the lep ii bound on the lightest chargino mass @xmath60 gev .",
    "these bounds will mainly constrain the parameters @xmath61 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 . *",
    "lower bounds on sparticle masses from lep and tevatron experiments @xcite @xmath62 where @xmath63 denotes the masses for the first two generation squarks .",
    "these constraints will put lower bounds on the soft breaking masses for sleptons and squarks .",
    "* the lep ii lower bound on the charged higgs boson mass , @xmath64 gev , which gives a lower bound on @xmath29 through the relation @xmath65 .",
    "* constraints from the direct search for higgs boson at lep ii @xcite , which include various channels of higgs boson productions @xcite .",
    "they will constrain the parameters @xmath29 , @xmath66 , @xmath0 as well as the masses and the chiral mixing of top squarks in a complex way . *",
    "constraint from the relic density of cosmic dark matter , i.e. @xmath67 @xcite , assuming the lightest neutralino is the dark matter particle .",
    "the relic density will constrain the parameters @xmath68 , @xmath4 , @xmath3 , @xmath29 , @xmath66 and @xmath0 in a complex way @xcite . *",
    "constraint from the stability of the higgs potential , which requires that the physical vacuum of the higgs potential with non - vanishing vevs of higgs scalars should be lower than any local minima .",
    "also , the scale of the higgs soft breaking parameters should not be much higher than the electroweak scale to avoid the fine - tuning problem .",
    "here we set 1 tev as the upper bound of the soft breaking parameters in the higgs sector .",
    "this will constrain the parameters @xmath29 , @xmath3 , @xmath32 , @xmath0 and @xmath69 . *",
    "constraints from precision electroweak observables such as @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , or their combinations @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "we require the predicted @xmath74 in the nmssm to be compatible with the lep / sld data at @xmath75 confidence level or equivalently @xmath76 .",
    "we take the correlation coefficient of @xmath74 from @xcite in calculating @xmath77 .",
    "this requirement will constrain the parameters @xmath78 , @xmath29 as well as the soft breaking parameters in the third generation squark sector . *",
    "constraint from @xmath79 , whose measured value is @xmath80 and the sm prediction is @xmath81 for @xmath82 gev @xcite . in our analysis",
    "we require @xmath83 is within the @xmath84 range of its experimental value .",
    "it has been shown that the susy contribution to @xmath85 might be sizeable for large @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "* constraint from the muon anomalous magnetic momentum @xmath87 . now both the theoretical prediction and the experimental measurement of @xmath87",
    "have reached a remarkable precision , but they show a significant deviation @xmath88 @xcite . in our analysis",
    "we require the susy effects to account for such deviation at @xmath84 level .",
    "the character of the susy contribution to @xmath87 is that it is suppressed by smuon masses but enhanced by @xmath66 .    among the above constraints ,",
    "( 1 - 6 ) and ( 9 ) have been encoded in the package nmssmtools @xcite . in our calculations",
    "we extend it by including the constraints ( 7 ) and ( 8) .",
    "the analytic expressions of @xmath74 and @xmath85 in the nmssm were given in our recent work @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we also calculated the nmssm contribution to @xmath87 ( when we started that work , the results in @xcite had not yet published ) , where we extended the neutralino- and chargino - mediated mssm contributions @xcite to the nmssm and also considered the contributions from the higgs - mediated diagrams @xcite and from the barr - zee diagrams @xcite .",
    "we checked that our @xmath87 results in @xcite agree with those in @xcite .",
    "note that in our analysis we did not include the constraints from various @xmath89-decays @xcite because they are dependent on squark flavor mixings and thus involve additional parameters .",
    "in this section , we scan over the nmssm parameter space to look for the region allowed by the constraints in the preceding section . since we are interested in the parameters sensitive to the constraints , we make some assumptions ( as conservative as possible ) for the other parameters such as soft breaking parameters in squark , slepton and gaugino sectors .    for the parameters in squark sector , we assume the so - called @xmath90 scenario , which can maximize the lightest higgs boson mass @xcite .",
    "this scenario assumes all the soft breaking masses in the squark sector to be degenerate @xmath91 with @xmath92 being the generation index .",
    "it also assumes the trilinear couplings to be degenerate @xmath93 with @xmath94 .",
    "we fix @xmath95 in our analysis since large @xmath96 can not only enhance the lightest higgs boson mass , but also decrease the contribution of the third generation squarks to the electroweak parameters , which has the same sign with the higgs contributions @xcite . for the parameters in slepton sector , we note that the slepton masses affect little on the constraints except the muon anomalous magnetic momentum . in our calculation",
    "we assume all the soft breaking parameters in the slepton sector are degenerate and take a value of @xmath97 gev ( we will discuss the effects of its variation ) .",
    "for the gaugino mass parameters , we assume the grand unification relation @xmath98 .    with the above assumptions , the free parameters are reduced to seven ( @xmath0 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath66 , @xmath29 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) and within the capability of our computer to perform a scan . during our scan , we first divide the varying range of @xmath0 into bins with each bin width being 0.1 and then we vary the values of other parameters in the following ranges @xmath99    with two hundred million samples in each bin and keeping the points satisfying the constraints , we finally get the allowed regions of these parameters .",
    "our scan results indicate that the number of the survived samples for @xmath100 is much larger than that for @xmath101 , which means that the parameters for small @xmath0 are much less constrained than the case with large @xmath0 .",
    "since we are interested in large @xmath0 , here we only show our scan results for @xmath101 .",
    "in fig.[lam - tanb ] we display the parameters ( scatter plots ) satisfying all the constraints ( 1 - 9 ) in the plane of @xmath0 versus @xmath66 . also , we present a curve which is the upper bound on @xmath66 without considering the muon g-2 constraints . to get this curve , we fix @xmath0 and scan over the parameters in eq.([scan - region ] ) .",
    "we adopt the important sampling method @xcite to optimize the varying range of @xmath66 .",
    "fig.[lam - tanb ] shows that the upper bound on @xmath66 gets stronger as @xmath0 gets large , and when all the constraints are considered , @xmath0 is upper bounded by about 1.5 .",
    "the underlying reason for this is that the constraints ( 1 - 8 ) , especially the constraint ( 7 ) , have limited the maximal value of @xmath86 , which decreases with the increase of @xmath0 .",
    "since a large @xmath66 is needed to explain the deviation of the muon g-2 , @xmath0 must terminate at a certain value where the corresponding @xmath66 value is too small to explain the muon g-2 .",
    "we have checked that the maximal value of @xmath0 is dependent on slepton mass .",
    "for example , for slepton mass of @xmath102 gev , @xmath103 gev and @xmath104 gev , the bounds on @xmath0 are @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively .    in fig.[lambda - all ]",
    "we display the nmssm parameters satisfying all the constraints in different planes .",
    "we see that for a large @xmath0 the parameters @xmath29 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath32 are also bounded in a certain region . for @xmath108 ,",
    "these bounded regions are @xmath109 gev , @xmath110 gev , @xmath111 gev and @xmath112 gev .    from the figure of @xmath2 versus @xmath0 in fig.[lambda - all ] one can see that the lower bound of @xmath2 increases as @xmath0 becomes large .",
    "the reason is that the lep ii direct search for higgs boson mainly limits the mass and the couplings of the light cp - even higgs boson whose component is dominated by the doublet higgs field @xmath113 or @xmath114 . for @xmath115 , this higgs boson should be dominantly composed by @xmath113 field since @xmath116 is smaller than @xmath117 , and its mass is to be reduced by the off - diagonal elements @xmath118 and @xmath119 . as @xmath0 gets larger , these off - diagonal elements get larger and hence reduce the mass of the light cp - even higgs boson , which then requires a larger @xmath2 to compensate in order to satisfy the lep ii lower bound .",
    "the figure of @xmath3 versus @xmath0 in fig.[lambda - all ] indicates that with the increase of @xmath0 , the upper bound of @xmath3 decreases .",
    "this is because in the off - diagonal elements @xmath120 and @xmath121 ( which reduce the light cp - even higgs boson mass ) , @xmath33 is always associated with @xmath3 , and to meet the lep ii bound a large @xmath0 must be accompanied by a small @xmath3 .",
    "the figure of @xmath4 versus @xmath0 in fig.[lambda - all ] shows that @xmath4 is also bounded in a narrow region .",
    "this is because the relic density of the dark matter correlates the parameters @xmath29 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath0 and @xmath69 in a complex way , and a large value for any of these parameters will limit severely the region of other parameters .",
    "the figure of @xmath32 versus @xmath0 in fig.[lambda - all ] shows that the trilinear soft breaking parameter @xmath32 for the singlet field is also limited . this can be understood from the expressions of @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "the stability of the higgs potential requires both of them to be positive , which sets an double - sided bound on @xmath32 .",
    "we also studied the relationship between the yukawa couplings @xmath0 and @xmath31 , and we found no correlation between them . even for @xmath124 , the value of @xmath31 can still vary from 0.3 to 1 .",
    "next , we take a look at the higgs boson masses allowed by the constraints .",
    "since a large @xmath0 can enhance the lightest cp - even higgs boson mass and thus avoid the little hierarchy problem , it is interesting to look at the dependence of the higgs boson masses on the parameter @xmath0 .    in figs.[lambda - mh ] and",
    "[ lambda - ma ] we show our scan results in @xmath0 versus @xmath125 plane and @xmath0 versus @xmath126 plane with @xmath125 being the lightest cp - even higgs boson mass and @xmath126 the lighter cp - odd higgs boson mass . from fig.[lambda - mh",
    "] one can learn that the upper bound of @xmath125 increases with @xmath0 , which is expected from eq.([limit ] ) , and for @xmath124 the value of @xmath125 can reach 210 gev . from fig.[lambda - ma ] one can learn that with the increase of @xmath0 , a super light cp - odd higgs boson is gradually ruled out , and for @xmath127 it is bounded in the range @xmath128 gev .",
    "the properties of these higgs bosons can be quite different from those in the mssm , and their phenomenology at the lhc was discussed in @xcite .    finally , in order to understand the mechanism used to reproduce the correct dark matter abundance , we consider the properties in the neutralino sector . in the nmssm with large @xmath66 ,",
    "the component of the lightest neutralino is either higgsino - dominant or bino - dominant for a light mass below 80 gev , but for a heavier mass it is bino - dominant . in fig.[lambda - chi ] we show our scan results in the plane of @xmath129 versus @xmath0 .",
    "we see that with the increase of @xmath0 , the upper bound on @xmath129 becomes stringent and eventually it is constrained in the range of @xmath130 gev . about the next lightest neutralino @xmath131 we found that its mass is constrained in the range of @xmath132 gev for @xmath133 . in order to figure out the annihilation mechanism of @xmath134 in providing for the dark matter relic density , we compare the masses of @xmath131 and @xmath135 with @xmath134 in fig.[spectrum ] .",
    "this figure indicates that @xmath131 is significantly heavier than @xmath134 . since in our scan the slepton masses",
    "are fixed to 200 gev , also significantly heavier than @xmath134 , we conclude that the coannihilation of @xmath134 with @xmath131 or with a slepton is generally boltzmann - suppressed and plays an unimportant role in accounting for the dark matter relic density .",
    "note that , as shown in fig.[spectrum ] , there are some samples around the funnel region @xmath136 and in this case the annihilation of @xmath134 through the s - channel exchange of a light @xmath135 becomes dominant @xcite .",
    "the nmssm with a large @xmath0 is an attractive scenario since it can push up the upper bound on the sm - like higgs boson mass to solve the little hierarchy problem .",
    "we examined the current experimental constraints on this scenario , which include the direct experimental bounds , the indirect constraints from precision electroweak measurements , the cosmic dark matter relic density , the muon anomalous magnetic moment , as well as the stability of the higgs potential .",
    "our results showed that for a large @xmath0 the parameter space is severely constrained .",
    "for example , for a smuon mass of 200 ( 500 ) gev the parameter space with @xmath5 is excluded , and for @xmath137 the allowed ranges are @xmath138 for @xmath78 , @xmath139 gev for @xmath2 , @xmath140 gev for @xmath3 , @xmath141 gev for @xmath4 and @xmath142 gev for @xmath32 .    finally , we would like to point out that our conclusion may be qualitatively applicable to other nmssm - like models such as the minimal nonminimal supersymmetric standard model ( mnmssm ) @xcite , which has similar structure with the nmssm and can be viewed as the low energy realization of the fat higgs model @xcite . for example , it has been pointed out that for any singlet extensions of the mssm , regardless the form of its superpotential , a large @xmath0 is always accompanied by a small @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "this property , as shown in our paper , can either limit the smuon mass or limit @xmath0 if we require the theory to explain the deviation of the muon anomalous magnetic momentum .",
    "another example is about the constraint from dark matter . in the mnmssm",
    "we expect that the constraint can limit the relevant parameters in a more stringent way than in the nmssm since the neutralino sector in the mnmssm is exactly same as in the nmssm but with fixed @xmath143 @xcite .",

    "<S> the next - to - minimal supersymmetric model ( nmssm ) with a large @xmath0 ( the mixing parameter between the singlet and doublet higgs fields ) is well motivated since it can significantly push up the upper bound on the sm - like higgs boson mass to solve the little hierarchy problem . in this work we examine the current experimental constraints on the nmssm with a large @xmath0 , which include the direct search for higgs boson and sparticles at colliders , the indirect constraints from precision electroweak measurements , the cosmic dark matter relic density , the muon anomalous magnetic moment , as well as the stability of the higgs potential . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , with the increase of @xmath0 , parameters like @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are becoming more stringently constrained . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the maximal reach of @xmath0 is limited by the muon anomalous magnetic moment , and for smuon masses of 200 gev ( 500 gev ) the parameter space with @xmath5 is excluded . </S>"
