    "due to their feeble interaction and flux , ultrahigh energy cosmic neutrinos are extremely difficult to detect . to overcome this difficulty one either needs a huge target volume for the detectors , or one has to employ novel detection techniques .",
    "besides , the unwanted strong backgrounds from cosmic ray protons must be effectively reduced . following these considerations , ultrahigh",
    "energy cosmic neutrinos are searched for in the earth atmosphere@xcite , in the greenland  @xcite and antarctic  @xcite ice sheet , in the sea / lake  @xcite , or even in the regolith of the moon  @xcite . for this purpose",
    "fluorescence detectors , ground arrays , underwater and -ice neutrino telescopes exist in various stages of maturity , from proposed to nearly completed . in this section",
    "we summarise general formulae for estimating neutrino - induced event rates .",
    "we discuss separately their applicability in the case when neutrinos interact significantly more strongly than in the sm , as predicted in many new physics scenarios  @xcite .",
    "we start with the differential rate of air showers initiated at the point @xmath2 by particles ( cosmic ray protons , cosmic neutrinos etc . ) incoming with energy @xmath3 and of flux @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the distance of this point to the detector measured along the shower axis , and @xmath6 is the angle to the zenith at the point where the shower axis hits the earth s surface ( cf .",

    "the hadronic component produced in the charged current ( @xmath33 ) and neutral current neutrino - nucleon interactions ( @xmath34 ) generates a shower which is visible at the ground array .",
    "the hadronic component inherits an energy @xmath35 from the neutrino .",
    "the charged current process for electron neutrinos produces both a hadronic shower ( @xmath36 ) and an electromagnetic shower ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "thus , in such a case all the energy is deposit in the atmosphere .",

    "this factor determines the effective aperture for neutrino detection . in the sm , neutrinos",

    "can be reduced to the more familiar formula @xmath42 it is obvious that ground arrays should look at the quasi - horizontal direction , i.e. @xmath43 , in order to achieve a large range of observability @xmath44 , and thus a larger neutrino detection rate . at the same time",
    ", it helps to reduce the backgrounds from cosmic ray protons .    for an under - ice neutrino telescope ,",
    "the hadronic and electromagnetic cascades are detectable only when they are initiated within or very close to the detector .",
    "the rate for the contained events per solid angle @xmath10 is @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the ice density , and @xmath47 is the effective volume of the detector , which is usually energy dependent .",
    "the exponential function takes into account the neutrino flux attenuation in the atmosphere and in the ice .",
    "here , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the distance traversed by neutrinos incident with zenith angle @xmath6 ( measured from the centre of the detector ) from the ice upper surface to the detector s surface .",
    "the flux attenuation in the ice is much more effective than in the atmosphere .",
    "the number of neutrinos reaching the detector s target volume will be strongly reduced if the neutrino - nucleon cross section is enhanced . on the other hand , at sufficiently high energies ,",
    "under - ice neutrino telescopes are also sensitive to interaction vertices located several kilometers away which produces muon(s ) or tau(s ) passing through the detector ( through - going muon and tau events ) .",
    "this increases their effective aperture for neutrinos largely .",
    "however , beyond the sm , the predictions of the muon or tau spectra depend strongly on the scenario considered ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "tau neutrinos can also be searched for through the showers induced by tau lepton decay in the atmosphere @xcite .",
    "though conventional astrophysical sources do not produce tau neutrinos , terrestrial experiments ( see e.g.  @xcite ) have shown that @xmath50 and @xmath51 are maximally mixed with a mass - squared difference @xmath52 .",
    "this , together with the known smallness of @xmath53  @xcite , implies that the @xmath50 s will partition themselves equally between @xmath50 s and @xmath51 s on lengths large compared to the oscillation length @xmath54  pc ; here @xmath55 is the third neutrino eigenstate .",
    "one consequence of this remarkable symmetry is the process of decohereing : any initial flavour ratio @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) that contains @xmath58 will arrive at earth with equipartition on the three flavours  @xcite . since cosmic neutrinos originate dominantly from the decay of @xmath59 and their muon daughters , their initial flavour ratios @xmath60 should arrive at earth democratically distributed , i.e. , @xmath61    if the geometrical configuration is met , tau neutrinos entering the earth at large nadir angles will convert to a tau lepton near earth s surface .",
    "the tau lepton exits the earth and then decays in the surroundings of the array .",
    "the detection rate depends on the neutrino survival probability after a distance @xmath62 in the earth for conversion to a charged lepton , and on the probability the charged lepton would escape the earth s surface with an energy above the detector s threshold , i.e.  @xcite @xmath63}{m_p}}\\ , \\,\\",

    "the effective aperture @xmath67 depends on the probability of the @xmath68 inducing a shower which triggers the detector .",
    "while improving the prospects of neutrino detection to a large extent , this signal is not always present when neutrino interactions predicted by scenarios beyond the sm are considered .",
    "an enhancement of the neutrino - nucleon total cross section will lead to a decrease of the neutrino interaction length in the earth .",
    "this will make the geometrical configuration even more difficult to meet .",
    "though the neutrino interaction probability is enhanced , the hadronic interaction products will be absorbed in the earth .",
    "the leptons which can escape the earth may only inherit a tiny fraction of the incident neutrino energy , so that the shower they induce is practically undetectable .",
    "this has been demonstrated in  @xcite with the example of black hole production in ultrahigh energy neutrino - nucleon scattering .",
    "nevertheless , the earth - skimming tau neutrinos provide a way to discriminate new physics interactions from sm `` backgrounds '' .    up to now",

    "the agasa data for deeply penetrating air showers recorded from december 1995 to november 2000 ( with an effective lifetime of 1710.5 days ) is published in  @xcite .",

    "we have also estimated the sensitivity of pao to neutrino interactions .",
    "this hybrid detector will facilitate powerful air shower reconstruction methods and control of the systematics errors which have plagued cosmic ray experiments to date . through a comparison of deeply developing showers and earth - skimming events , in 6 yr of operation the observatory will be able to probe neutrino interactions at the level of sm predictions , providing a final verdict on the rise of the neutrino - nucleon inelastic cross section at ultrahigh energies .",
