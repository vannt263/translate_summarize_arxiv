    "<S> we report the first measurement of the lepton forward - backward asymmetry @xmath0 as a function of the squared four - momentum of the dilepton system , @xmath1 , for the electroweak penguin process @xmath2 with a sum of exclusive final states , where @xmath3 is an electron or a muon and @xmath4 is a hadronic recoil system with an @xmath5 quark . the results are based on a data sample containing @xmath6 @xmath7 pairs recorded at the @xmath8 resonance with the belle detector at the kekb @xmath9 collider . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 for the inclusive @xmath2 is extrapolated from the sum of 10 exclusive @xmath4 states whose invariant mass is less than 2 gev/@xmath10 . for @xmath11 gev@xmath12/@xmath10 , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13 is excluded at the 2.3@xmath14 level , where @xmath14 is the standard deviation . for @xmath15 gev@xmath12/@xmath10 , </S>",
