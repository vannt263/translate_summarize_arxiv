    ", we now find reliable quantum - enabled applications , among others , in secure communication , referred to as quantum cryptosystems  @xcite , teleportation - based quantum communication  @xcite , metrology  @xcite , as well as in fast computing algorithms  @xcite .    in this framework ,",
    "integrated optics ( io ) technologies allow realizing complex and scalable quantum circuits  @xcite , finding striking repercussions in all the above mentioned research areas , otherwise unreachable using bulk approaches .",
    "notably , quantum random walks ( qrw ) and boson sampling are very good examples of new topics in quantum physics being enabled by integrated optics  @xcite .",
    "a qrw can be implemented via a constant splitting of photons into several possible waveguide .",
    "experimentally , it amounts to chaining 50/50 beam - splitters , but the price to pay is the rapidly growing size of the setup . until the 21-evanescently - coupled waveguides demonstrated in 2001 by the university of bristol ( uk )  @xcite , the largest realization using bulk optics used to be limited to a 5-item system . yet , technology triggered a new pathway for quantum information processing as a 101-coupled - waveguides device was presented in 2014  @xcite .",
    "this example clearly shows the potential of integrated optics ( io ) when it comes to enabling new research fields .",
    "the aim of this article is to establish that integrated photonics provides a powerful technological basis for a broad class of advanced quantum experiments .",
    "most of the devices we shall discuss have taken advantage of guided - wave optics ability to dramatically enhance the efficiency of nonlinear interactions .",
    "this is because it permits maintaining high optical power densities over distances far exceeding those permitted by the diffraction limit in bulk devices . for passive devices ,",
    "io has provided a possibility of assembling many components on single chips , simplifying the realization and use of complex circuits .",
    "however , io faces one problem , that of coupling integrated devices to subsequent fiber systems . in seminal experiments",
    "@xcite , for instance , entangled photon pair collection efficiencies were limited , preventing from reaching the level of bulk optics approaches . nowadays , monolithic integrated devices containing advanced photonics circuit powered by on - chip photon - pair sources are having a tremendous impact on the progress made in the field of quantum information science .",
    "more specifically , quantum photonics requires fully integrated devices for producing ( multiple ) pairs of entangled photons efficiently , and where photons can be coherently manipulated using frequency - conversion stages , dynamical routers and phase shifters , combined with external photons , and eventually detected .",
    "those devices are therefore often considered as enabling quantum nodes where bits of quantum information ( qubits ) can be tailored at will and on - demand thanks to on - chip capabilities .    among the multiple platforms available that are covered for example in ref .",
    "@xcite , this review focuses on lithium niobate ( linbo@xmath0 , in the following this material will be referred to as ln ) only .",
    "the motivation lies in the fact that , compared to equivalent setups exploiting different platforms , such as silicon photonics  @xcite or silica  @xcite , ln circuits enable highly efficient periodically poled waveguide ( ppln / w ) photon - pair sources as well as ultra - fast electro - optic modulators . those complementary aspects make them unique and very appealing for on - chip engineering of quantum light despite they feature a larger footprint and incompatibility with cmos electronics .    in the following",
    ", we will start with briefly presenting ln properties from the material science perspective .",
    "then , we will discuss in more details the applications of such a platform along five thematics : entangled photon - pair sources , heralded single photons , applications ranging from quantum interfaces to quantum memories , and the use of io for linear quantum computing and bright squeezed state of light .",
    "we will finish with a conclusion and some perspectives related to ln - based integrated quantum photonic devices .",
    "we shall note that this review is not intended to be encyclopaedic .",
    "it rather intends to provide a honest overview on ln integrated optical technology as applied to various tasks , while referring to works of historical interest as well as current state - of - the - art .",
    "when considering the requirements for a quantum photonics platform , the material has obviously to be transparent in the wavelength ranges of interest . moreover , when photon - pair generation is intended , high nonlinear coefficients are desired , as well as practical phase - matching solutions . less",
    "critically , the damage threshold should be as high as possible , and the substrate should ideally be available in large scale , at low cost , with high quality and uniformity . in this section , we will start with a quick comparison between several materials motivating why ln appears as a prime candidate for quantum photonics platforms .",
    "we will then discuss the properties of ln and the material structuration available for photon pair generation .",
    "we will finish with a quick overview of the post processing characterizations used to evaluate the performance of such devices for quantum applications .",
    "generally speaking , three families of materials are currently used :    * non - centrosymmetric crystals ( or @xmath1 crystals ) are the most widely used , well - known , and exploited materials to obtain efficient nonlinear processes ; * symmetric materials such as silica ( or @xmath2 materials ) , have lower nonlinearities , however they also have lower losses , therefore less efficient frequency conversions can be compensated by much longer interaction lengths .",
    "note that artificial @xmath1 nonlinearities can be induced via poling techniques  @xcite , despite reduced overall optical nonlinearity and the fact that poled gratings can usually not be engineered over more than a few cm lengths ; * semiconductors such as silicon and algaas are promising materials thanks to extremely controlled technological processes allowing to design very small footprint nanostructures potentially exploiting some of the highest nonlinear coefficients reported to date ( _ e.g. _ , in znse @xmath354  pm.v@xmath4 ) .",
    "however , practical phase - matching conditions or propagation losses are still issues at the present time  @xcite .    tab .",
    "[ materials ] presents the most commonly used @xmath1 crystals benefiting from high enough fabrication quality as well as a compatibility with waveguide integration technologies .",
    "although etching processes allow obtaining waveguide structures in beta - baryum borate ( bbo ) and lithium triborate ( lbo ) , the associated propagation losses are usually very high @xmath5  @xcite , which is at least one order of magnitude higher compared to waveguide structures realized on ln , lithium tantalate ( lt ) , and potassium titanyl phosphate ( ktp ) .",
    ".usual nonlinear crystals used for frequency conversion.[materials ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as depicted in  [ fig_hsps_nicesetup ] , a pump telecom laser emitting pulses at the wavelength of 1540 nm and at the ultra - fast repetition rate of 10ghz is first frequency doubled via a second harmonic generation stage ( shg , consisting of an spe : ppln / w ) .",
    "this conversion stage fulfils the qpm condition for producing frequency degenerate photon pairs in another type-0 spe : ppln / w via spdc . in other words ,",
    "the wavelength of the emitted photons is centred around 1540 nm .",
    "as was discussed in section  [ sec_epps ] and more particularly  [ fig_djeylan_dwdm_spectrum ] , energy conservation set by the spdc process makes it possible to use a dwdm filter combination in order to pick up , within the emitted spectrum , twin photons slightly apart from perfect degeneracy ( channels symmetrically spaced around the central wavelength ) and to separate them deterministically .",
    "the entire setup downstream the spdc stage , including the hbt arrangement for the heralded photon characterization , is made of standard telecom components only .",
    "the measured heralding efficiency is @xmath6 .",
    "as discussed in  @xcite , the high repetition rate of the laser allows producing photon pairs at a high rate while , per each pump pulse , @xmath7 is maintained as low as required for negligible two - photon events .",
    "thanks to this strategy , single photons can be heralded at rates reaching values as high as 2.1mhz , with a constant @xmath8 as low as 0.023 .",
    "this @xmath8 value not only proves negligible multi - photon contributions but also represents the best measurement reported to date in the literature for @xmath9 in the mhz regime  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath9 is directly proportional to the detection efficiency , it could be straightforwardly increased up to 10mhz by replacing the heralding detector with a more efficient one without affecting the @xmath8 value .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    eventually , as proposed by a. migdall and co - workers in 2002  @xcite , speeding up the rate at which heralded photons are made available can also be achieved by spatial multiplexing of several simultaneous spdc stages .",
    "as shown in  [ fig_hybrid ] , a recent demonstration of this concept has been realized in 2014 thanks to a collaboration between our group and macquarie and sydney universities ( australia )  @xcite . in this work , thanks to a hybrid device incoporating the best of two state - of - the - art integrated photonics technologies , four identical sources of heralded single photons are spatially multiplexed using waveguide structures only . more specifically , hybridization means here that four ppln / ws integrated on a single substrate are interfaced in - between passive routers fabricated by femtosecond - laser direct writing ( fldw ) on glass substrates .",
    "additional fast fibre optical switches are placed at the output of the main device for enabling the routing of the heralded single photons towards a single fibre output .",
    "the first fldw chip allows splitting a pulsed laser into to pump four identical type-0 spe : ppln / ws .",
    "the chosen qpm condition permits generating , by spdc , non - degenerate pairs of photons whose wavelengths are centred at 1310 and 1550 nm .",
    "note that the mean pump power is kept low enough in order to statistically create much less than one photon - pair at a time in either one of those four ppln / ws .",
    "wherever they come from , the photon - pairs are then coupled to another fldw routing chip that contains four individual integrated wdms for separating the paired photons as a function of their wavelengths . after on - chip separation , the heralding photons at 1310 nm are directed towards single - photon detectors ( ingaas avalanche photodiode ) , and the heralded photons at 1550 nm are directed to a routing stage based on optical switches .",
    "note that external wavelength fibre filters ( not represented in  [ fig_hybrid ] ) are employed for augmenting the extinction ratio and therefore the overall snr . depending on the detection results , _",
    "i.e. _ , which detector fires among the four , rf electronics enables controlling the switches for routing the 1550 nm photons towards a single main fibre output .",
    "the setup performances are outlined in terms of coincidences - to - accidentals ratio ( car ) among heralded and heralding photons  @xcite .",
    "this parameter characterizes the snr of a photon source against background noise and provides , indirectly , information about two - photon - pair contributions by assuming a poissonian photon - pair statistical distribution .",
    "the data obtained with the setup depicted in  [ fig_hybrid ] clearly show how spatial multiplexing ensures an increase in photon rates while maintaining a fixed snr .",
    "more precisely , an increase by a factor 3 was demonstrated , instead of 4 as expected , as one of the four nonlinear waveguides showed much higher losses compared to the three others .",
    "the experiment also showed , to date , the largest number of identical on - chip photon - pair sources having identical spectral properties .    in conclusion ,",
    "the concept of heralded single photons based on photon - pair generation has proven to be very practical . for a long time , the probabilistic emission of paired photons was argued to prevent this kind of source to be scalable .",
    "this point has indeed been compensated by the highest emission rate reported to date and the single character of the heralded photons . in this context ,",
    "ppln waveguides are excellent candidates for real - world implementations of hspss for quantum communication . from one side ,",
    "as demonstrated by many experiments , they allow to reliably and efficiently produce heralded photons at telecom wavelengths as demanded for long distance operation in optical fibres . at the same time , ppln / ws - and more generally speaking , ln - chips - are highly compatible with fibre - based telecom technology , thus opening the route towards a full exploitation of existing fibre networks and classical telecom systems .",
    "in this section , we address waveguide - based systems for which the very properties of ln structures have permitted demonstrations of both quantum interfaces and memories .",
    "the former corresponds to coherent wavelength transposition based on nonlinear optics of a photonic qubit prepared at one wavelength to another , while the latter permits coherent storage and retrieval of photonic excitation in and out of a matter system . quantum storage of photonic excitations often relies on energy transitions prepared in a well isolated ensemble of atoms , such as rubidium or caesium , or in a collection of rare - earth ions , such as thulium or praseodymium , embedded in a crystalline matrix .",
    "however , these energy transitions often belong to the visible range of wavelengths , preventing from storing directly telecom photonic qubits .",
    "this is why coherent quantum interfaces appear to be interesting to make flying and stationary qubits compatible , and possibly all designed in an entire waveguide approach  @xcite .",
    "nowadays entanglement appears as essential for most of quantum technologies . in the particular case of quantum communications ,",
    "the manipulation of entanglement has to be possible , for it to be of any practical value .",
    "accordingly , a growing community of experimental physicists are working with entanglement transposition , especially in view of the connection of different users on a quantum network consisting of quantum channels along which photonic qubits travel  @xcite and atomic ensembles are used to store and process the qubits  @xcite .",
    "it is thus timely to develop quantum information interfaces that allow transferring the qubits from one type of carrier to another , _",
    "i.e. _ , in the case of photonic carriers , able to provide back and forth a wavelength adaptation to atomic levels while preserving quantum coherence of the initial state  @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", we will discuss in this section two type of interfaces : the ones for increasing the energy of the photonic carriers toward the visible region and those decreasing the energy toward the telecom range .",
    "chronologically , the first demonstration , in 2005 , addressed an up - conversion transfer ( increasing the frequency ) for energy - time coded entangled photons .",
    "the inherently noise - free sum - frequency generation process was exploited to coherently transfer qubit carried by a photon at the telecom wavelength of 1312 nm to another photon at 712 nm , _",
    "i.e. _ , close to that of alkaline atomic transitions  @xcite .",
    "this operation has been shown to preserve entanglement in the following way : an initial photon at 1312 nm , energy - time entangled with another photon at 1555 nm ( see also sec .  [ pioneering_ent_sources ] and  [ hybrid_polar_ent_sources ] ) , was up - converted to 712 nm . provided the coherence length of the pump laser is longer than the size of the unbalanced analysis interferometers  @xcite ( see also caption of  [ fig_energy - time_tanz_2002 ] for more details ) , the authors verified that the transfer actually preserves the quantum coherence by testing the entanglement between the produced photon at 712 nm and the untouched photon at 1555 nm .",
    "although those two photons were nt originally entangled , the transferred entanglement was found to be almost perfect  @xcite . in other words , despite no energy conservation , up - conversion at the single photon level does not reduce the amount of entanglement .     a photonic quantum interface enabling the coherent transfer of single qubits from photons at 1310 nm , initially entangled with photons at 1555 nm , to photons at 712 nm . in this realization",
    ", it is shown that entanglement is preserved through the up - conversion process . a source ( s ) produces , by spdc in a spe : ppln waveguide ( not shown ) , pairs of energy - time entangled photons whose wavelengths are centered at 1555 and 1312 nm .",
    "these photons are sent to alice and bob , respectively , via optical fiber links .",
    "the qubit transfer is then performed at bob s location from a photon at 1312 nm to a photon at 712 nm using sum frequency generation ( sfg ) in another spe : ppln waveguide .",
    "this nonlinear waveguide is pumped by a cw , 700mw , and high coherence laser operating at 1560 nm .",
    "the success of the transfer is tested by measuring the quality of the final entanglement between the 712 nm photon and 1555 nm photon using two unbalanced michelson interferometers and a coincidence counter between detectors d@xmath10 and d@xmath11 . the interference pattern obtained for the coincidence rate as a function of the sum of the phases acquired in the interferometers ( @xmath12 ) shows a visibility greater than 97% .",
    "compared to the 98% obtained with the initial entanglement ( curve not represented ) , the fidelity of the transfer is therefore greater than 99% .",
    "figure inspired from ref .",
    "@xcite.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    more specifically , the single photon up - conversion transfer is based on mixing the initial 1312 nm single photon with a highly coherent pump laser at 1560 nm in a spe : ppln waveguide , as depicted in  [ fig_interface ] .",
    "the internal up - conversion efficiency of 80% of the chip correspond to a single - photon up - conversion probability of @xmath135% , including the phase - matching filtering losses .",
    "the resulting photon at 712 nm , filtered out of the huge flow of pump photons , and the remaining 1555 nm photon were then analyzed using two unbalanced michelson interferometers in the franson configuration  @xcite ( _ i.e. _ , the usual setup for testing energy - time or time - bin entanglement ) .",
    "a comparison of the degrees of entanglement before and after the up - conversion stage indicates no noticeable degradation and leads to a quantum information transfer fidelity higher than 99% .",
    "more recently , reverse process quantum interfaces , _ i.e. _ decreasing the qubit - carrier photon frequency by dfg ( see also section  [ sec_nli ] , have been investigated . similarly to sfg , this stimulated single photon down - conversion process is also a noise - free process and requires strong requirement on the coherence of the pump laser .",
    "demonstrations of such quantum interfaces have been reported almost simultaneously in 2010 using single photonic qubits by the geneva group  @xcite and ntt japanese research groups  @xcite , and in 2011 using entangled photon pairs at the university of osaka  @xcite .",

    "it is important to note that the quantum interfaces discussed above are not limited to the specific wavelengths reported in the corresponding papers , even if for some practical issues , the triplet 710 nm , 1310 nm and 1550 nm was an optimal choice . those are proof - of - principle experiments and suitable modifications of phase - matching conditions and pump wavelengths would enable engineering the result of the frequency - conversion processes to any desired wavelength triplet . more precisely , waveguide structures , as described in sec .",

    "the basic operation is as follow : let us suppose there is an initial qubit @xmath25 , encoded on a photon at 1530 nm and travelling along a fiber quantum channel connected to port a to the relay chip .",
    "at the same time , a laser pulse at 766 nm , synchronized with the arrival time of the photon , enters through the nonlinear zone of the chip which consists of a ppln waveguide .",
    "here , it generates by spdc an entangled pair of photons ( 2 and 3 ) whose wavelengths are respectively centred at 1530 nm and 1534 nm .",
    "then , the first 50/50 directional coupler ( @xmath26 ) is used to separate the created entangled photons in such a way that photons 1 ( sent by alice ) and 2 arrive at the same time at the second 50/50 coupler ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "if conditions on the polarization states , central wavelengths , and coherence times are met , photons 1 and 2 can be projected onto one of the four entangled `` bell states '' .",
    "the resulting state is identified by coincidence analysis ( & -gate ) on detectors @xmath23 and @xmath24 placed at the output of the chip . as a result of this measurement , the quantum state @xmath25 ( initially carried by photon 1 ) can be teleported onto photon 3 that exits the chip at port b , ideally without any degradation of its quantum properties .",
    "this is made possible by photon 3 being initially entangled with photon 2 . as a consequence",
    "the resulting electrical trigger is not only the signature of the presence of the initial carrier at the relay chip location but also of the departure of a new one coded with the same qubit state that remains unknown . from a practical point of view , when this teleportation process is repeated on all the qubits travelling along the quantum channel , we obtain , at the output of the chip , `` relayed '' photonic qubits coded on telecom photons .",
    "this relay function is ensured by the fact that each photon arrives synchronized with an electrical signal given by the and - gate which allows triggering bob s detectors at the end of the channel and therefore increasing both the snr and the communication distance . on the technological side ( see  [ relay_nice ] ) , the chip features a photon - pair creation zone and two tunable couplers ( which will be operated in 50/50 regime ) .",
    "the waveguiding structures are obtained using soft proton exchange on a z - cut crystal .",
    "a 10 mm long ppln zone of poling period of 16.6@xmath21 m allows the generation of twin photon at 1535 nm at the temperature of @xmath27c .",
    "the directional couplers @xmath26 and @xmath22 consist of two waveguides integrated close to each other over mm - length .",
    "if the spacing is sufficiently small , energy is exchanged between the two guides .",
    "an electro - optical control of the coupling ratio is made possible using deposited electrodes enabling switching from 0 to 100% coupling ratios and reconfigurable operation . to correctly separate photons 2 and 3 and entangle 1 and 2 , the two couplers are set to the 50/50 ratio .",
    "once manufactured , the chip has been characterized using a weak coherent source in the single photon regime using the so - called hom two - photon interference effect , which is seen as the major preliminary step towards achieving teleportation .",
    "we obtained a quantum interference featuring 79%@xmath2825% net visibility using two independent single photons , one external and one from the on - chip created pairs .",
    "the result is in good agreement with the theoretical expectation of 75% accounting for the single photon statistics .",
    "the large error bars are essentially due to a non - optimal detection scheme and a lossy device ( 9db ) leading to a very low three - fold coincidence rate .",
    "however , it has been shown that the achievable quantum communication distance could be possibly augmented by a factor of 1.4 in that particular case .",
    "another excellent example of high integration is given by the chip from nanjing university ( china )  @xcite .",
    "it gathers on a single substrate six different optical functions made of annealed proton exchanged waveguides integrated on a z - cut ppln crystal .",

    "typical cw pump powers are below 0.5mw .    .",
    "the photon pairs ( red ) are generated in the pump waveguide and propagate in the regime of quantum walks .",

    "basically , it implies that , at each position @xmath41 , one has to consider the coherent superposition of created pairs hopping back and forth from the central waveguide but also the contribution of pairs created earlier .",

    "eventually , three telecom photons are produced out of one green pump photon and the tricky part of the experiment lies in the mean number of pairs ( s1 and i1 ) to be maintained below 0.1 to ensure that only three photons are generated at a time . in other words , the triplets overall generation probability can not be artificially compensated by increasing the pump power . here",

    "<S> integrated optical components on lithium niobate play a major role in standard high - speed communication systems . over the last two decades , after the birth and positioning of quantum information science , lithium niobate waveguide architectures have emerged as one of the key platforms for enabling photonics quantum technologies . due to </S>",
    "<S> mature technological processes for waveguide structure integration , as well as inherent and efficient properties for nonlinear optical effects , lithium niobate devices are nowadays at the heart of many photon - pair or triplet sources , single - photon detectors , coherent wavelength - conversion interfaces , and quantum memories . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , they find applications in advanced and complex quantum communication systems , where compactness , stability , efficiency , and interconnectability with other guided - wave technologies are required . in this review paper , we first introduce the material aspects of lithium niobate , and subsequently discuss all of the above mentioned quantum components , ranging from standard photon - pair sources to more complex and advanced circuits . </S>"
