    "for suspensions composed of long polymer chains and colloidal particles , a wealth of materials properties can be explored by tuning the polymer - colloid interactions .",
    "for example , in suspensions in which the polymers and the colloids do not bind to one another , flocculation of large aggregates can be controlled by tuning the polymer concentration , which determines the effective depletion or electrostatic forces between colloidal particles ( as reviewed in , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "in other systems , polymer - colloid interactions lead to the formation of polymer bridges between colloidal particles , which results in macroscopic gelation or flocculation ( as reviewed in , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "a similar bridging mechanism leads to gelation in polymer - micelle systems  @xcite .",
    "such bridging phenomena have been modeled in terms of the adsorption of polymer chains onto the surfaces of suspended particles  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we instead consider a suspension in which polymer bridges form between globular suspended particles due to the presence on each such particle of a _ single specific site _ to which the polymer binds . for this system ,",
    "aggregation is limited by the polymer chain length and , therefore , the aggregates are limited to the microscale and , thus , do not flocculate .",
    "we consider the case for which the polymer - colloid binding is reversible .",
    "for this case , we describe how it may be possible to control experimentally the characteristic size of aggregates , for example by tuning the length of the polymer chains , the temperature , or the density of colloidal particles .",
    "the size of aggregates then determines the macroscopic materials properties of the suspension .    to develop a statistical mechanical approach to the structure of these aggregates , we model the colloidal particles as hard spheres , and the polymers as gaussian chains , possibly with self - avoidance . by considering key physical features of polymer - colloid suspensions  the steric repulsion between the colloidal particles and the presence on each particle of exactly one binding site for polymer chains",
    " we derive results for the statistics of the number @xmath0 of colloidal particles attached to each polymer chain and , consequently , of the linear size @xmath1 of the aggregate .",
    "thus , for self - avoiding polymer chains we derive the following expressions for the mean and variance of @xmath0 : @xmath2 in terms of @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 is the temperature ) , the chemical potential @xmath5 of the colloidal particles , the polymer - colloid binding energy @xmath6 , the characteristics of an isolated polymer chain ( _ i.e. _ , the segment length @xmath7 , the number of segments @xmath8 , and the radius of gyration @xmath9 ) , and the radius @xmath10 of a colloidal particle . the relative width of the distribution [ which is given by @xmath11 decreases as the binding energy ( and , thus , the size of the aggregate ) increases . as a consequence , for sufficiently large aggregates the size distribution",
    "is sharply peaked around the mean , and the aggregates may be addressed within one of the two essentially equivalent ensembles ",
    "canonical at fixed @xmath0 , or grand canonical at fixed @xmath5 . in suspension ,",
    "such aggregates may themselves be modeled in terms of effective self - avoiding chains , each composed of @xmath0 segments of segment length @xmath12 , so that the typical linear size @xmath1 of an aggregate is given by @xmath13 .",
    "the physical system that inspired this model is the suspension of biomolecular aggregates composed of long chains of the polysaccharide hyaluronan ( ha , which behaves as a polymer chain  @xcite ) and the types of globular macromolecules called proteoglycans ( pg , _",
    "e.g. _ , aggrecan , versican , brevican and neurocan  collectively known as lecticans  @xcite ) that bind to ha .",
    "although the `` beads on a string '' language has been used to describe the euchromatin structure of nucleosome beads along a string of dna , we do not intend to describe that system in this work .",
    "these aggregates are found in numerous biological contexts , including the extracellular matrix ( ecm )  @xcite and the cell - surface - associated polymer matrix called the pericellular coat  @xcite .",
    "for example , in cartilage , a high concentration of aggrecan ( which is bound to hyaluronan strands and therefore aggregated ) works in concert with a dense network of collagen fibrils to form a tough and resilient load - bearing material .",
    "the aggrecan attracts water into the tissue by osmosis , thereby exerting a swelling pressure on the collagen network and enabling the cartilage to resist large compressive loads ( see _ e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as another example , when bound to the surfaces of cells , pg aggregates co - regulate cell behavior , especially processes that involve changes in cell adhesion , such as migration  @xcite , proliferation  @xcite , and synaptogenesis  @xcite .    in this biological context , the parameters in eq .",

    "* we choose @xmath18 to correspond to the size of the pg molecules that attach to the ha chain . in real systems ,",
    "the pg molecules are somewhat anisotropic bottlebrushes , having cylindrical dimensions @xmath19 when fully stretched  @xcite but , for simplicity , we do not include this anisotropy in the model .",
    "we expect that , as a consequence of thermal fluctuations , the typical shape of the pg molecules in solution is less anisotropic . in order to model globular bottle - brush polymers that are highly swollen as a result of electrostatic repulsion between their highly charged side - chains ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] )  @xcite , we include hard - core repulsion between the globules .",
    "in biological contexts , the debye length is sufficiently short ( @xmath20 ) that the only relevant interaction is the strong , steric repulsion that suppresses pg - pg overlap . *",
    "the binding site of each pg molecule occupies @xmath21 of ha contour length , _",
    "i.e. _ , a length  @xcite . * pg - ha aggregates in cartilage",
    "are composed of up to @xmath22 pg globules bound to a single ha chain  @xcite .",
    "[ sec : intro ]",
    "we begin by giving a detailed account of the models we shall use to describe a composite system consisting of a single polymer chain and the globular particles that bind to it .",
    "next , we construct the partition function for a single aggregate .",
    "we then simplify this partition function to obtain our main result : the distribution of aggregate sizes , by which we mean the distribution of @xmath0 as well as of @xmath1 .",
    "we emphasize the interplay between chain entropy and the binding statistics of globules , and also emphasize associated phenomena occurring on lengthscales that are much larger than the ha persistence length . at these large lengthscales ,",
    "a chain model is sufficient to capture the physical properties of the polymer , and we consider both the models of gaussian and self - avoiding chains . for a gaussian chain , the polymer segments are modeled by hookean springs ( of natural length @xmath7 ) , which connect universal joints at positions @xmath23 ( with @xmath24 ) .",
    "self - avoiding chains , in addition , self - interact , via the potential @xmath25 , which is relevant for physical polymers in a good solvent . thus , the effective free energy of chain configuration @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 we use this chain model only for sufficiently small stretching of the chain .",
    "the opposite case of chains so taut as to resist further stretching through molecular binding energy , rather than through entropic elasticity , requires more detailed , chain - specific , considerations .",
    "we model the globular proteoglycans as particles at positions @xmath28 ( with @xmath29 ) , interacting with one another via a two - body potential .",
    "we assume the effects of the inherent anisotropy of these molecules to be negligible , and thus model their interactions via a central - force potential @xmath30 .",
    "furthermore , we approximate @xmath30 as a short - range , hard - sphere potential of radius @xmath10 , to account for the mutual impenetrability of the globules , which in essence holds at the relevant energy scales : @xmath31    the partition function for one aggregate factors in all configurations of the chain segments @xmath26 and of the hard spheres @xmath32 , as well as the locations @xmath33 of the binding sites of the @xmath34 hard sphere along the chain backbone ( which we may take to be ordered , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath35 for all @xmath36 ) . each @xmath37 may take on values in @xmath38 , and is associated with the binding constraint @xmath39 .",
    "thus , in terms of the chemical potential @xmath5 of the suspended globules and the binding energy @xmath6 , the boltzmann factor for creating a globule bound to a monomer of the chain is @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "for an aggregate formed in a sufficiently dilute suspension of globules , @xmath5 is related to the density of unbound globules @xmath41 via the expression @xmath42 , obtained from the analogous expression for the chemical potential of an ideal gas . in this ( grand canonical ) ensemble ( with respect to the globules ) , the partition function of an aggregate may be expressed as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the partition function for an aggregate with a fixed number @xmath0 of bound globules ( _ i.e. _ , in the canonical ensemble ) and is given by    @xmath45 \\left[\\prod_{m = 1}^m d { \\bm{{\\rm x}}}_m\\right ] \\left",

    "thus , this partition function considers all of the configurations of a single aggregate , and assigns each configuration the appropriate weight .",
    "we use the assumptions that @xmath48 and @xmath49 , so we need not consider polymer end effects .",
    "thus , we replace @xmath50 by @xmath51 , and chose the index @xmath52 to run from @xmath53 to @xmath8 . as a consequence of the assumption that @xmath49 , the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : z ] ) can be approximated by an integral , with the result that @xmath54        to achieve further progress , we make the following assumptions , which are mathematical consequences of the physical ranges of the parameters necessary for the aggregates to form :    1 .   only `` nearest - neighbor '' globule - globule interactions matter .",
    "thus , the globule at @xmath28 only interacts with those at @xmath55 .",
    "@xmath56 for all such pairs , indicating that the interacting hard - core globules almost touch each other .",
    "@xmath57 indicating that the bound globules are evenly spaced along the contour of the polymer chain .",
    "the limits of validity of these assumptions , and the corrections that would arise from relaxing them , are explored in the appendix . as a consequence of assumption  1 ,",
    "the partition function depends on the coordinates of the globules only through the combinations @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "furthermore , using assumption  2 , the inter - globule interaction simplifies via @xmath60 , which implements the notion that all pairs of adjacent , mutually impenetrable globules are strongly tethered to one another .",
    "finally , using assumption  3 , the partition function decomposes into that of @xmath0 subchains , with each subchain being composed of @xmath61 segments and each being stretched to a distance @xmath62 ( and where @xmath63 is the partition function for one subchain ) .",

    "expression  ( [ eq : res - idl ] ) indicates that the relative width of the distribution is small : @xmath73 , which follows because @xmath74 , _ i.e. _ , because the bound globules swell the chain .",

    "i.e. _ , the radius of each `` blob ''  @xcite comprising the stretched chain is much greater than the size of the globular particle . in this regime ,",
    "the globules all fit inside the blobs of the polymer chain and , therefore , the aggregate is only slightly swollen by the globules . by contrast , physical hyaluronan - proteoglycan aggregates are significantly larger than isolated chains , and therefore correspond to the anharmonic regime .    in this anharmonic regime , for which and the chain is highly stretched  @xcite , we have from eq .",

    "to study the structure and thermodynamics of aggregates in suspension , we first consider the configurations of a single isolated aggregate , and then include the effects of inter - aggregate interaction .",
    "thus , let us focus on an aggregate having @xmath0 bound globules , and consider the configurations of the aggregate that dominate @xmath44 .",
    "under assumptions 1 , 2 , and 3 , these configurations form a family characterized by the location of the center of mass of the aggregate , as well as the values for the @xmath92 angular coordinates of @xmath93 .",

    "the characteristic linear size of a single aggregate is approximately @xmath94 .",
    "however , assumption  1 is too strong to describe a physical aggregate .",
    "thus , we relax this assumption by allowing for interactions between arbitrary pairs of globules ( which are labeled @xmath36 and @xmath95 )",
    ". there are then two notable effects of these additional interactions .",
    "first , for small @xmath96 , the interactions limit the ranges of the bond angles . for example , as a consequence of the fact that two next - nearest - neighbor spheres can not overlap , the angle between globules @xmath36 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 must lie within the range @xmath99 to @xmath100 . such effects quickly diminish as @xmath96 increases .",
    "macroscopically , these interactions have the effect of stiffening the chain at fixed contour length .",
    "we take this effect into account by representing the aggregates as a freely - jointed chains having a segment length on the order of , but somewhat greater than , @xmath12 .",
    "second , the avoidance between distant globules swells the aggregate , which , therefore , we represent as a self - avoiding chain .",
    "this effect is analogous to that of the swelling of a polymer chain in good solvent , with the consequent result for the aggregate size : @xmath101  @xcite .",
    "the size distribution of the aggregate , given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : res - id ] , [ eq : resm - sa]-[eq : resw - sa ] ) , is not affected by these interactions .",
    "this is a consquence of the fact that the number @xmath102 of orientational degrees of freedom of the effective aggregate chain is small compared to the total number @xmath103 of chain degrees of freedom .    , composed of @xmath0 segments . in the dilute regime ,",
    "the aggregates do not overlap , as shown on the bottom right . in the semi - dilute regime , as shown on the bottom left , the aggregates overlap at small globule packing fractions . in the dense regime (",
    "not shown ) , the globule packing fraction approaches @xmath53 .",
    "the assumptions are indicated using the circled numbers @xmath53 , @xmath104 , and @xmath105 . ]",
    "we now consider many aggregates in suspension , and explore their thermodynamics in three regimes  dilute , semidilute , and dense .",
    "as we shall see : ( 1 )  for sufficiently _ dilute _ suspensions , the properties of the individual aggregate should be largely independent of the aggregate concentration , with only small corrections due to aggregate - aggregate interactions .",
    "this results from a separation of energy scales , as the entropy of stretching is much larger than the aggregate - concentration - dependent free energy . on the other hand , ( 2 )  for sufficiently _ dense _ suspensions",
    ", the suspension behaves essentially as a dense suspension of globules , with only small corrections due to the presence of the polymer chains .",
    "this results from the fact that the concentration - dependent free energy is much larger than the entropy of chain stretching .",
    "( 3 )  the crossover between these two regimes occurs at densities sufficiently large that the suspension is described as dense rather than dilute or semidilute .",
    "these results follow by considering a suspension of aggregates , and introducing the additional thermodynamic quantities @xmath106 ( the aggregate number density ) , @xmath30 ( the system volume ) , and @xmath107 ( the number of aggregates ) . for convenience",
    ", we choose to work at fixed @xmath108 .",
    "we remark that the suspension is considered dilute if the characteristic size of the aggregate is much smaller than the inter - aggregate spacing , _ i.e. _ , if @xmath109 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : sols ] . for a dilute aggregate suspension",
    ", we may estimate the osmotic pressure @xmath110 using the virial expansion as @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the volume of a single aggregate , @xmath113 and @xmath114 is a numerical virial coefficient ( which for a hard - sphere fluid has the value @xmath115 ) .",
    "note that the first term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pi1 ] ) is independent of aggregate size ; a weak dependence on aggregate size results from the ( small ) second term .",
    "thus , in the dilute regime , the total helmholtz free - energy density of the suspension @xmath116 is given by @xmath117 which is dominated by the large chain - stretching term @xmath118 .",
    "the second term in the virial expansion provides only a small correction to the result , shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : resm - sa ] ) , for @xmath87 , associated with deswelling of each aggregate .",
    "we now turn to the semidilute regime , in which the suspended aggregates overlap , although the spacing between individual globules is large , relative to their size ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : sols ] .",
    "this occurs for the density range @xmath119 . by analogy with the ideal chains , a mean - field approximation for the properties of semi - dilute suspensions yields an expression for the free - energy density given by  @xcite @xmath120 as @xmath121 , the two terms are only comparable when @xmath122 , which may exist for some range of parameters .",
    "however , for the physical parameters of ha - pg aggregates , @xmath123 is of order one .",
    "this means that for semi - dilute suspensions of ha - pg aggregates , the concentration of aggregates will not affect aggregate size .",
    "the scaling laws resulting from this mean - field theory can be corrected to account for aggregate - density fluctuations in suspensions of self - avoiding aggregates .",
    "to do so , we introduce the stretching exponent @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) ; then the expression for the free - energy density becomes ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath126 these fluctuation corrections suggest that only for parameter values such that @xmath127 would the aggregate concentration not affect aggregate size .    for solutions dense in globules , the osmotic pressure of the hard - sphere globules can dominate over the chain - stretching entropy . in that case ,",
    "the chain degrees of freedom provide small corrections to a free energy that is essentially the same as the free energy of hard spheres of radius @xmath10 .",
    "that is , sufficiently dense suspensions behave as dense suspensions of globules , with only small corrections arising from the chain binding .",
    "we conclude by first discussing the implications of the model developed in this work to hyaluronan - proteoglycan aggregates , and then discussing the implications of this model to other materials , including synthetic ones . for hyaluronan - proteoglycan aggregates , we have obtained the dependence of ( i )  the number of bound proteoglycans per aggregate and ( ii )  the size of the aggregate on model parameters such as the temperature , binding energy , size , and chemical potential of the globules , as well as the contour and persistence lengths of the hyaluronan chain .",
    "these predictions can , in principle , be experimentally tested in both biological and synthetic systems . to clarify these potential tests",
    ", we revisit an important assumption of the model , viz .",
    "the assumption that the polymer chain is flexible .",
    "as mentioned above , this assumption holds as long as the polymer chain segment between two neighboring bound globules is much longer than the polymer persistence length .",
    "this , therefore , sets limits on the number of bound globules in an aggregate for which the model remains applicable .",
    "we conjecture that for aggregates outside this limit , the binding of additional globules is suppressed due to the bending stiffness of the polymer chain . to test the scaling laws predicted by the model considered here within a single experiment",
    ", one may vary the chemical potential of the globules or , equivalently , the concentration of free globules in solution .",
    "other parameters , such as the length - distribution of synthetic hyaluronan and the size of the aggrecan globules may also be varied from experiment to experiment .",
    "this model also leads us to obtain expressions for the free energy of a suspension of many aggregates for several regimes , such as dilute ( with respect to the aggregate concentration ) or semi - dilute ( and still dilute with respect to the globules ) .",
    "we thus predict  in terms of the aggregate parameters  the osmotic pressure and compressibility of the suspension and , in the semi - dilute regime , the presence of a correlation length ( observable via scattering ) , as well as the @xmath128 scaling of the osmotic pressure with the aggregate density .",
    "these predictions , too , can be tested in experiments on either synthetic or biological hyaluronan - proteoglycan systems , and can be used to deduce materials parameters of these suspensions .",
    "thus , the thermodynamic results obtained here may lead to advances in the understanding of neuroplasticity as well as the relationship between joint mechanics and materials properties of cartilage .",
    "the beads - on - a - string model , which we have presented here , is also sufficiently general to describe materials beyond the example of hyaluronan - proteoglycan aggregates on which we have focused .",
    "this model combines two basic models of statistical mechanics : the hard - sphere model , which describes suspensions , and the random walk model , which describes polymer chains .",
    "it thus has the potential to describe any material composed of a suspension of large globular particles that have specific binding sites through which the globules bind to flexible polymer chains .",
    "a possible candidate for such a material , designed to realize the theory presented here , may be envisioned as a synthetic system composed of colloidal particles and polymer chains .",
    "for this system to aggregate according to the model we have considered , the colloidal particles must be functionalized with a single binding site that has a strong affinity to be bound to a polymer chain , which could be accomplished , _",
    "e.g. _ , with complementary strands of dna  @xcite .",
    "the chains must be sufficiently long to accommodate many bound colloids , and the binding energy must be sufficiently strong to promote aggregate formation , but not so strong as to lead to irreversible binding . within this artificial system , it may be possible to control such parameters as the binding energy ( via the dna strand length and sequence ) , the temperature , and the colloid concentration and size  either during the preparation phase of the experiment or during the experiment itself . a suspension composed of these microscopic aggregates",
    "would be a biologically inspired fluid metamaterial , and have the remarkable property that the size of the aggregates is reversibly controllable .",
    "therefore , the model presented in this work could guide the creation of suspensions that have finely tunable viscoelasticity as well as exhibit reversible sedimentation . by studying the properties of macroscopic suspensions of these colloid - polymer aggregates ,",
    "one may gain further understanding of the materials properties that biology has realized as a result of natural selection , as well as use this understanding for materials engineering .",

    "first , let us examine a generic pair - interaction potential between globules @xmath129 and consider the distance between two `` nearest - neighbor '' globules @xmath130 ( see fig .  [",

    "<S> macroscopic properties of suspensions , such as those composed of globular particles ( _ e.g. _ , colloidal or macromolecular ) , can be tuned by controlling the equilibrium aggregation of the particles . </S>",
    "<S> we examine how aggregation  and , hence , macroscopic properties  can be controlled in a system composed of both globular particles and long , flexible polymer chains that reversibly bind to one another . </S>",
    "<S> we base this on a minimal statistical mechanical model of a single aggregate in which the polymer chain is treated either as ideal or self - avoiding , and , in addition , the globular particles are taken to interact with one another via excluded volume repulsion . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , each of the globular particles is taken to have one single site to which at most one polymer segment may bind . within the context of this model , we examine the statistics of the equilibrium size of an aggregate and , thence , the structure of dilute and semidilute suspensions of these aggregates . </S>",
    "<S> we apply the model to biologically relevant aggregates , specifically those composed of macromolecular proteoglycan globules and long hyaluronan polymer chains . </S>",
    "<S> these aggregates are especially relevant to the materials properties of cartilage and the structure - function properties of perineuronal nets in brain tissue , as well as the pericellular coats of mammalian cells . </S>"
