    "bl lacertae objects , like quasars , were discovered in the late sixties as unexpected extragalactic counterparts of bright radio sources .",
    "soon after their discovery the number of known qsos ( radio loud , and especially the radio quiet ones ) grew rapidly thanks to the detection of many new objects at optical and radio frequencies .",
    "very few bl lacs could instead be found due to their peculiar characteristics which include lack of strong emission lines and absence of the `` big blue bump '' .",
    "the strong optical variability and polarization properties that are typical of bl lacs turned out not to be sufficiently strong features to allow the discovery of many new objects of this class at optical frequencies .",
    "the number of known bl lacs remained very low for a long time . when the first generation of x - ray satellites ( uhuru , ariel v ) established that emission line agn are strong x - ray emitters also bl lacs were detected as powerful x - ray sources . shortly afterwards the heao1 all sky x - ray surveys discovered many new agn including a few bl lacs ( piccinotti 1982 ) .",
    "the small number of bl lacs compared to qsos ( both at radio and x - ray frequencies ) , together with their extreme properties , nicely fitted into the picture where these objects are the fraction of relativistically beamed sources that happens to be viewed at a small angle with respect to our line of sight ( blandford & rees 1978 ) . the total number of beamed sources pointing in any direction ( the parent population of bl lacs )",
    "would then be much larger .",
    "when the observatory detected x - ray emission form nearly all known agn and discovered many new ones as serendipitous sources , the number of x - ray discovered bl lacs was expected to grow in proportion to that of qsos .",
    "surprisingly instead ( although some bl lacs were indeed found as x - ray serendipitous sources establishing that the x - ray selection is one of the main methods for the selection of new bl lacs ) the fraction of bl lacs was found to sharply decrease at faint x - ray fluxes .",
    "the strong increase of space density or luminosity at earlier cosmic epochs ( cosmological evolution ) that was found in the radio , optical and x - ray counts of qsos was clearly not present in the population of bl lac objects ( stocke 1982 ; maccacaro 1983 ) .",
    "the medium sensitivity survey ( emss ) convincingly showed that x - ray selected bl lacs display negative cosmological evolution , that is either there were less objects or they were less luminous in the past ( morris 1991 ; wolter 1991 ; rector 2000 ) .    in the following paragraphs we review the main results on the cosmological evolution of bl lacs as obtained from several surveys in different energy bands .",
    "bl lacs are intrinsically rare objects , therefore it is necessary to select them amongst a much larger number of other contaminating sources . historically this has been done by means of two main techniques :    1 .",
    "bl lacs are searched for in flux limited samples by means of optical spectroscopy of _ all _ the candidates detected above the survey limit .",
    "this approach can be afforded only if the number of candidates is of the order of 1000 or less . in the following",
    "we will refer to these surveys as classical surveys. 2 .",
    "the search makes use of a pre - selection achieved through a cross - correlation of sources detected in surveys carried out in different energy bands , sometimes combined with multi - band spectral restrictions .",
    "the candidate bl lacs can then be identified through optical spectroscopy as in classical surveys or through statistical identification techniques .",
    "the big advantage of this method is that the pre - selection can reduce the number of candidates from several thousands or even millions to much smaller samples including only a few hundreds objects or less .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     we have next considered the case of a ` classical ' x - ray flux limited survey like the emss . to keep things simple we have chosen a single x - ray flux limit equal to @xmath0 rather than a sky coverage with multiple flux limits .",
    "we do not expect significant differences between the two cases .",
    "the that we obtained for the total sample is 0.49 , only slightly lower than the expected value of 0.5 in case of no dependence between @xmath1 and luminosity .",
    "we have then verified whether our simulated survey shows the strong dependency of on the ratio ( or , equivalently on ) found by rector 2000 .",
    "table 4 shows the values for increasing values of .",
    "a clear dependency of the on is confirmed .",
    "this dependence , however is still present even if @xmath1 is set to be constant for all simulated sources .",
    "the decrease of at high values in our simulation is due to the fact that high sources close to the x - ray survey limit must be weak radio sources near the low luminosity end of the radio luminosity function . at even higher values",
    "the radio luminosity becomes lower than the low luminosity limit of our lf and the number of sources drops .",
    "another , possibly more important , reason for the observed dependency on could be incompleteness of the sample at very faint optical magnitudes . in a x - ray flux limited sample",
    "high ( low ) sources tend to have faint optical magnitudes as shown in the left part of figure 4 where the is plotted against mv .",
    "a small incompleteness , possibly arising from the misclassification of optically very faint bl lacs with cluster of galaxies or radio galaxies , introduces a spurious correlation between and .",
    "we have simulated this incompleteness by removing 5% of the sources at the optically faint end of the simulated survey .",
    "the results are reported in parenthesis in table 4 where we can see that the decrease of with becomes considerably higher than in the complete sample .",
    "the right plot in figure 4 shows a clear correlation between redshift and showing that extreme hbl sources are expected to be on average at higher redshift that less extreme bl lacs as found by bade ( 1998 ) .",
    "various surveys at radio and x - ray frequencies show that the amount of cosmological evolution in bl lacs is significantly lower than that found in other types of agn .",
    "the results however vary from no evolution ( or slightly positive evolution ) at high flux values to strong negative evolution at faint fluxes , especially for extreme objects with very high .      *",
    "a dependency of the beaming doppler factor @xmath2 on radio luminosity ( expected in the relativistic beaming scenario ) can at least partially explain the low values found in some x - ray and radio flux limited samples .",
    "* edge effects due to the flattening at the low luminosity end of the radio luminosity function of bl lacs can be one of the reasons for the correlation of and x - ray loudness ( ) .",
    "* even small amounts of incompleteness at very faint optical fluxes induce a correlation between and similar to that seen in the emss and rass hbx surveys ."
