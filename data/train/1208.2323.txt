    "brown dwarfs are sub - stellar objects that are too low in mass to sustain hydrogen fusion reactions in their cores but much higher than planets . studies of brown dwarfs are important because they may provide a missing link between stars and planets @xcite , two populations that have dramatically different formation history . in addition , the galaxy may be teeming with brown dwarfs although there is no evidence for a large population of brown dwarfs from current observations @xcite .",
    "brown dwarfs had long been thought to exist based on theoretical considerations @xcite . however , these objects are intrinsically faint and thus the first confirmed brown dwarf was not discovered until 1995 @xcite",
    ".    there have been 2 major methods of detecting brown dwarfs .",
    "the first is direct imaging by using ground ( e.g. ,  schuh 2003 ) and space - borne ( e.g. ,  mainzer 2011 ) infrared instruments . as in the case of extrasolar planets",
    ", brown dwarfs can also be indirectly discovered by detecting wobbles in the motion of the companion star or the flux decrease of the companion star caused by the brown dwarf occulting the companion star .",
    "microlensing is also an effective method to detect brown dwarfs .",
    "gravitational microlensing refers to the astronomical phenomenon wherein the brightness of a star is magnified by the bending of light caused by the gravity of an intervening object ( lens ) between the background star ( source ) and an observer . since the phenomenon occurs regardless of the lens brightness , microlensing was proposed to detect dark components of the galaxy such as black holes , neutron stars , and brown dwarfs @xcite .",
    "although effective , the application of the microlensing method in brown dwarf detections has been limited .",
    "the main reason for this is the difficulty in distinguishing brown dwarf events from those produced by main sequence stars . for general lensing events in which a single mass causes the brightening of a background star , the magnification of the lensed star flux depends on the projected lens - source separation , @xmath4 , by @xmath5 where the lens - source separation is normalized by the radius of the einstein ring , @xmath6 ( einstein radius ) .",
    "the lens - source separation is related to the lensing parameters of the time scale for the source to cross the einstein radius , @xmath7 ( einstein time scale ) , the time of the closest lens - source approach , @xmath8 , and the lens - source separation at the moment of the closest approach , @xmath9 ( impact parameter ) , by @xmath10^{1/2}.\\ ] ] among these lensing parameters , only the einstein time scale provides information about the physical parameters of the lens .",
    "however , it results from the combination of the lens mass , distance , and transverse speed of the relative lens - source motion and thus it is difficult to uniquely determine the mass of the lensing object .",
    "not knowing the mass , then , it is difficult to single out brown dwarf events from those produced by stars . in principle , it is possible to measure the lens mass by additionally measuring the einstein radius and the lens parallax , which are respectively related to the physical parameters of the lens by @xmath11 and @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the mass of the lens , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the distances to the lens and source star , respectively .",
    "the einstein radius is measured by analyzing the distortion of the lensing light curve affected by the finite size of the source star @xcite , while the lens parallax is measured by analyzing the deviation in a lensing light curve caused by the deviation of the relative lens - source motion from a rectilinear one due to the change of the observer s position induced by the orbital motion of the earth around the sun @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the chance of simultaneously measuring @xmath6 and @xmath18 is very low for a single - lens event .",
    "the finite source effect is important only for very high magnification events , for which the lens - source separation is comparable to the source size @xcite , but these events are very rare .",
    "the parallax effect is important only for events with time scales that are a significant fraction of the orbital period of the earth , i.e.  1 yr . however , such long time - scale events are unlikely to be produced by low mass brown dwarfs because @xmath19 . as a result , there exist only two cases for which the lens of a single lensing event was identified as a brown dwarf @xcite .    in binary lensing events ,",
    "in which the lens is composed of two masses , on the other hand , the chance to identify the lens as a brown dwarf is relatively high .",
    "there are several reasons for this .",
    "first , for binary lensing events , it is possible to routinely measure the mass ratio , @xmath20 , of the lens components .",
    "then , brown dwarf candidates can be sorted out based on the first order criterion of small mass ratios .",
    "second , the majority of binary lensing events involves caustic crossings @xcite .",
    "the caustics represent the positions on the source plane at which the lensing magnification of a point source becomes infinite .",
    "the caustic - crossing part of a lensing light curve varies depending on the source size .",
    "analysis of the light curve affected by this finite source effect allows one to measure the einstein radius , which allows for better constraint on the lens mass .",
    "third , the chance to measure the lens parallax is high , too .",
    "this is because the duration of an event corresponds to the total mass of the binary lens system not the low mass component and thus the average time scale of a binary lens event is longer than that of a single lens event .    despite these advantages ,",
    "there exists only one event ( ogle-2008-blg-510 ) for which the companion of a binary lens is known to be a brown dwarf candidate @xcite .",
    "the main reason for the rarity of brown dwarf events is the difficulty in analyzing binary lensing light curves due to the complexity of the light curves .",
    "for binary lensing events in which the mass ratio between the lens components is very low as in the case of a binary composed of a star and a planet , the signature of the low mass companion appears as a short term deviation on the top of an otherwise smooth and symmetric single lensing light curve of the primary . as a result , identification and analysis of planetary events",
    "are relatively simple , resulting in more than 20 identified microlensing planets .",
    "however , the perturbative nature of the companion breaks down and the light curve becomes very complex for binaries with mass ratios greater than @xmath21 , which corresponds to the mass ratio of a typical binary lens composed of a brown dwarf and a star .",
    "this introduces difficulties in the immediate identification of a brown dwarf event .",
    "a firm identification of a brown dwarf event requires detailed modeling of lensing light curves .",
    "unfortunately , modeling light curves of binary lensing events is a difficult task due to the complexity of @xmath22 surface in the parameter space combined with the heavy computation required for analysis . as a result ,",
    "detailed modeling of binary events was conducted for a small subset of events , resulting in a small number of identified brown dwarfs . in recent years , however , there has been great progress in the analysis of binary events with the development of analysis methods based on advanced logic combined with improved computing power .",
    "this progress made the analysis not only more precise but also faster .",
    "as a result , nearly all binary lensing events are routinely modeled in real time with the progress of events in current microlensing experiments @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we present brown dwarf candidates found from the analyses of binary lensing events detected from microlensing experiments conducted from 2004 to 2011 . in  2 , we describe the criteria of choosing brown dwarf candidates , observation of events , and data reduction . in  3 , we describe the procedure of modeling . in  4 , we present the results of the analysis . in  5 , we draw our conclusions .",

    "to search for brown dwarf candidates , we investigate binary lensing events discovered during 2004  2011 microlensing observation seasons . considering that typical galactic microlensing events are produced by low mass stars @xcite ,",

    "in the analyses of each lensing light curve , we search for the solution of lensing parameters that yield the best fit to the observed light curve . the basic structure of a binary lensing light curve is described by 7 parameters .",
    "the first three parameters @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath7 are identical to those of a single - lensing event and they specify the source motion with respect to the lens .",
    "the next 3 parameters describe the binary lens system , including the projected separation between lens components in units of the einstein radius , @xmath31 , the mass ratio between the lens components , @xmath20 , and the angle between source trajectory and the binary axis , @xmath32 .",

    "the ray - shooting method requires heavy computation .",
    "we thus minimize computation time by applying the ray - shooting method only when the source crosses or approaches very close to caustics and utilizing the semi - analytic hexadecapole approximation @xcite in the adjacent area .    in computing finite magnifications , we consider the variation of the magnification caused by the limb - darkening of the source star surface for events with well - resolved features involving caustics . in our model ,",
