    "the growing sample of accretion - powered millisecond x - ray pulsars divides naturally into two groups .",

    "the latter two sources have also both exhibited thermonuclear ( type - i ) x - ray bursts , whereas the three ultracompact binaries have not .",

    "goodxenon records the arrival time ( 1  @xmath0s resolution ) and energy ( 256 channel resolution ) of every unrejected photon , while the chosen event configuration has @xmath12s time resolution and 64 energy channels .",
    "we analysed fits production data using lheasoft version 5.3.1 ( 2004 may 20 ) and estimated the background flux using the `` cm '' bright - source model for pca gain epoch 5 ( from 2000 may 13 ) .",
    "the photon arrival times at the spacecraft were converted    = 8.5 cm    to barycentric dynamical times ( tdb ) at the solar system barycenter using the jet propulsion laboratory de-200 solar system ephemeris @xcite along with a spacecraft ephemeris and _ rxte _ fine clock corrections .",
    "the position adopted was that of the proposed optical counterpart @xcite .",
    "data from the 20200  kev high - energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ; * ? ? ?",

    "the rms amplitude decreased throughout the outburst , gradually to 6% on december 11 ( mjd  53350 ) and then more rapidly down to a minimum of @xmath15% by december 14 .",
    "the pulsations became undetectable ( @xmath16% rms ) from december 15 ( mjd  53354 ) onwards , and the residual flux which was detected after this date likely arose from other sources in the _ rxte _ field of view .",

    "we then corrected these light curves for orbital motion based on the best - fit orbital solution , and folded on the pulsar period to measure the energy dependence of the pulsations .",
    "the fractional rms pulsed amplitude decreased with energy , from 10% in the 23  kev range to 6.5% between 716  kev , dropping further to 5% above 16  kev ( fig .",

    "the profile was approximately sinusoidal at all energies .",
    "of the higher harmonics , only the second harmonic ( 1198  hz ) was detected at @xmath17 confidence in more than one energy band ( although not in all bands ) , at fractional rms amplitudes of a few tenths of a percent . upper limits on the fractional amplitudes for the third and higher harmonics were of similar magnitude .",

    "in contrast to other accretion - powered millisecond pulsars , where the hard lead saturates above 10  kev @xcite , in igr  j00291 + 5934  we found evidence for a slight decrease in the lead above 9  kev .",
    "we found no evidence for modulation of the x - ray intensity at the orbital period , ruling out eclipses or dipping behavior .",

    "we estimate a typical @xmath18 upper limit for features with fwhm of up to 100  hz of @xmath19% rms ( compare to the 510%  rms khz qpos measured in sax  j1808.4@xmath13658 ; * ? ? ?",

    "we fitted hexte and pca spectra , the latter extracted separately for each pcu ( excluding pcu # 0 , which has lost its propane veto layer ) between 2.5200  kev .",
    "we obtained a good fit with a model consisting of a power law with spectral index 1.71.8 , attenuated by neutral absorption with a column depth of @xmath20 .",
    "this is only slightly higher than the survey value of @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "a comptonization model @xcite gave a marginally better fit to the highest signal - to - noise spectra but the scattering electron temperature ( which gives rise to a high - energy roll off in the spectra ) could not be measured , save that it was @xmath22  kev .",
    "this implies an optical depth for scattering ( assuming spherical geometry ) of @xmath23 .",
    "we also found evidence for neutral fe k@xmath10 line    = 8.5 cm    emission at 6.4  kev , with equivalent width @xmath24  ev . while the line emission could potentially originate from other sources within the @xmath25 _ rxte _ field of view , or from diffuse galactic emission , a _",

    "thus , the peak pca flux measurement of @xmath34 ( 2.525  kev ) on december 3 ( mjd  53342 ) is likely a good measure of the peak outburst flux .",
    "we calculated a correction factor of 2.54 from the broadband spectral fits to apply to the 2.525  kev fluxes , in order to estimate the bolometric flux ( here taken as the flux from 0.1200  kev ) .",
    "assuming the outburst commenced on december 2 ( mjd  53341 ) , we estimated a total fluence for the outburst of @xmath35 .",
    "the _ rxte _ mission - long ( 19962004 ) 210  kev flux history of igr  j00291 + 5934  produced from asm observations confirmed the current outburst , as well as revealing evidence for two previous instances of activity , on 1998 november 2628 and 2001 september 1121 @xcite .",
    "these results indicate that the transient appears regularly , roughly every three years , similar to the 401  hz pulsar sax  j1808.4@xmath13658 , which exhibits outbursts every @xmath15  yr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "combined with the estimated 3-yr recurrence time of the outbursts in igr  j00291 + 5934 , and assuming similar fluences , we estimate a long - term time - averaged flux for igr  j00291 + 5934  of @xmath36 .",

    "these objects underscore the statistically significant absence of pulsars with spins faster than 650  hz which has been noted previously @xcite .",
    "it remains unclear whether this cutoff in the spin distribution reflects the distribution of neutron star magnetic field strengths ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) or angular momentum losses from gravitational radiation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )      in many respects , igr  j00291 + 5934  closely resembles the best - known millisecond pulsar , sax  j1808.4@xmath13658 .",
    "the mass function in igr  j00291 + 5934  implies a minimum companion mass of @xmath39 ( for a @xmath40 neutron star and binary inclination @xmath41 , although the lack of x - ray eclipses or dips implies @xmath42 ) . for an isotropic _ a priori _ distribution of inclinations",
    ", we find an upper limit on the companion mass of @xmath43 ( 95% confidence , assuming @xmath44 ) .",
    "the inferred mass - radius relation intersects that of a hydrogen main sequence star at a companion mass of @xmath45 ( fig .",

    "this indicates that , like sax  j1808.4@xmath13658 , the mass donor in igr  j00291 + 5934  is a hot brown dwarf , likely heated by low - level x - ray emission during quiescence @xcite .",
    "for very low - mass companions , the mass transfer rate driven by gravitational radiation is @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the mass of the donor and @xmath49 the mass of the neutron star . using the long - term averaged flux of @xmath36",
    ", we derive a minimum distance of roughly 4  kpc ( for a companion mass of @xmath50 ) .",
    "this would place the system at least 200  pc away from the galactic plane , likely within the disk .",
    "we note that the @xmath51 above refers to the mass transfer rate averaged over a much longer time scale than the _ rxte _ mission lifetime , so that this distance estimate must be viewed with some caution .",
    "the peak inferred accretion rate for a distance of 4  kpc is @xmath52 ( where @xmath53 is the hydrogen eddington limit for spherical accretion onto a @xmath40 neutron star ) .",
    "this is comparable to the maximum reached by sax  j1808.4@xmath13658 during its 2002 october outburst , when four thermonuclear ( type - i ) x - ray bursts were detected by _ rxte",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "the minimum burst interval in sax  j1808.4@xmath13658 was 21  hr . if the distance to igr  j00291 + 5934  is greater than 4  kpc , the accretion rate would also be larger by a factor of @xmath54 , and we would expect more frequent bursts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case",
    ", however , we would expect to have detected at least one burst in our      _ rxte _",
    "observations , since the observational duty cycles during the 2002 october outburst of sax  j1808.4@xmath13658 and the 2004 december outburst of igr  j00291 + 5934  were comparable .",
    "the non - detection of thermonuclear bursts from igr  j00291 + 5934  thus suggests that the source distance is not significantly greater than 4  kpc .",
