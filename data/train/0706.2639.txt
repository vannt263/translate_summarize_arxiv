    "over the last two decades scientists have developed a huge variety of different vacuum chamber designs serving distinctive purposes for experiments in atom optics . an important and challenging task in many experiments",
    "is the reliable production of bose - einstein condensates @xcite in combination with additional experimental tools .",
    "depending on the physics to investigate specialized setups have been developed explore transportable condensates @xcite , toroidal shaped condensates @xcite , condensates on microchips @xcite .",
    "other designs featuring experimental extensions like high finesse cavities @xcite and multi - channel plates @xcite have been realized . here",
    ", we present a new apparatus for the investigation of rydberg atoms in ultracold quantum gases .",
    "the setup itself is based on a standard bec - setup @xcite , which is used in many atom optician laboratories over the world , though , it has the unique capability to investigate and manipulate rydberg atoms in the quantum degenerate regime .",
    "bose - einstein condensates are produced by trapping and cooling atoms from a thermal atom source , usually from a solid alkali metal . after slowing down the velocity of the thermal atoms by several orders of magnitude",
    "they can be trapped in a magneto - optical trap , that is , three pairs of laser beams confining the atoms around the center of a superposed magnetic quadrupole field . due to scattering of light in the magneto - optical trap it is not possible to achieve condensation in this type of trap .",
    "thus , the atoms have to be loaded in a trap , in which the confining potential is not build up by near resonant light .",
    "one possibility to realize a conservative trapping potential is an intense far off resonant light field ( fort ) .",
    "the trapping potential is build up by the dipole force , which is due to the interaction between the light and the induced dipole moment of the atom .",
    "another possibility , and by far the most common , is to trap the atoms magnetically in a ioffe - pritchard type trap @xcite .",
    "the ioffe - pritchard trap is formed by a radial 2d quadrupole field and an axial dipole field , which yields a radial gradient and a superposed axial curvature . once the atoms are tightly confined evaporative cooling is applied to cool the atoms into the quantum degenerated regime in which the ground state is macroscopically occupied and the atoms form a coherent matter wave .",
    "the combination of bose - einstein condensates with rydberg atoms opens a new field of research aiming for strong interactions and strongly correlated mesoscopic systems .",
    "the coherence properties of quantum degenerate gases in combination with a coherent excitation scheme into rydberg states yields an ideal tool box to study decoherence processes in mesoscopic systems @xcite and for testing the preconditions for quantum computing @xcite .",
    "the strong interaction between rydberg atoms is governed either by the van der waals interaction , which can induce a blockade effect in rydberg excitation @xcite or the anisotropic dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "a handy feature of rydberg atoms is the tunability of the interaction strength by either choosing a certain rydberg state or by applying suitable electric fields @xcite .    far reaching insight in the properties of rydberg atoms",
    "have been achieved by experiments on thermal atomic beams @xcite . with the discovery of laser cooling techniques @xcite it is now possible to extend the experiments to so called frozen rydberg gases @xcite .",
    "the name reflects the fact that the atomic motion at temperatures in the microkelvin regime are nearly frozen out during the typical experimental timescales of several microseconds .",
    "the relatively high densities of several @xmath0 atoms / m@xmath1 privilege these systems to investigate the interaction among rydberg atoms . in such systems",
    "several groups have investigated the van - der - waals interaction @xcite and the resonant dipole - dipole interaction @xcite including the angular dependence of the dipole - dipole interaction @xcite . with the observation of a coherent excitation @xcite",
    "is it now possible to study the coherence properties of mesoscopic quantum systems under the influence of strong interactions @xcite .",
    "closely related to the frozen rydberg gases is the simultaneously evolving research field on ultracold plasmas @xcite , which can be studied in the same setups .",
    "finally , the extension of such setups to degenerate quantum gases increases not only the parameter space of available densities and temperatures by several orders of magnitude , but allows also for phase sensitive measurements using a coherent matter wave with well defined internal and external states .    besides the ability of the apparatus to produce stable bose - einstein condensates working with ultracold rydberg atoms requires a modification of the common setups .",
    "especially components to apply strong electric fields over the atomic cloud and ion or electron detectors for the detection of rydberg atoms are required .",
    "additionally a narrow - band laser system is required , to excite the atoms into specific rydberg states or to gain coherent control over the excitation .",
    "this paper is organized in the following way .",
    "we describe the vacuum chamber in the next section , followed by a characterization of the bose - einstein condensate in section [ chapbec ] .",
    "the sections [ chaprydlaser ] and [ chapefield ] are covering the manipulation of the rydberg atoms , namely , introducing the rydberg laser system and the electric field generation .",
    "the detection of rydberg atoms is presented in section [ chapmcp ] followed by a measurement of a stark map in section [ chapstark ] . in the end",
    "an outlook is given in section [ chapoutlook ] .",
    "the vacuum chamber consists mainly of two parts as shown in fig .",
    "[ picwholechamber ] .",
    "the oven assembly , which is operated at high vacuum ( @xmath2 mbar ) , delivers a thermal beam of gaseous rubidium atoms into the ultra - high vacuum part of the setup ( @xmath3 mbar ) for further processing .",
    "the basic design of our setup can be found in several experimental groups in similar realizations and a detailed description of its basic principles can be found in @xcite . at",
    "the given pressure in the main chamber we measured a lifetime of more than 160 seconds of magnetically trapped @xmath4 atoms .",
    "overview of the complete vacuum system .",
    "a thermal beam of rb - atoms is produced with an effusive oven and slowed down with a zeeman - slower which connects the oven part with the main chamber .",
    "the required ultra - high vacuum in the main chamber is accomplished with an ion pump and a titanium sublimation pump , which can be cooled down with liquid nitrogen . ]",
    "the production of a bose - einstein condensate consists of several successive experimental steps .",
    "the starting point is a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) , which is in our case loaded by an atomic beam produced by an effusive oven and slowed down by a zeeman - slower . within a few seconds",
    "several @xmath5 atoms are caught in the mot .",
    "to reduce the temperature of the magneto - optically trapped atoms to about 25 - 30 k we apply a grey molasses cooling scheme for 30 ms @xcite . as a next step the atoms",
    "are optically pumped to the @xmath6 state and transferred into a best possible mode - matched pure magnetic trap . in this trap",
    "the atomic cloud is cooled down within 30 s to quantum degeneracy by forced evaporative cooling using radio - frequency techniques . by this procedure",
    "we are able to produce bose - einstein condensates with @xmath7 atoms every 40 s.        the main chamber depicted in fig .",
    "[ picmainchamber ] has to fulfill several boundary conditions simultaneously .",
    "first of all , good optical access in three dimensions for laser cooling is necessary .",
    "two further optical axes are added for imaging which are equipped with two larger view - ports ( cf 63 ) to obtain a better optical resolution .",
    "the numerical apertures in both imaging axes are 0.17 which yields an optimal resolution of 5.6 m for a wavelength of 780 nm . altogether",
    "eleven optical view - ports ( 7056 glass ) are available which are suitable for wavelengths ranging from 300 nm to 2.5 m. at the same time close by magnetic coils for magnetic trapping are necessary .",
    "we use a cloverleaf style ioffe - pritchard trap @xcite which is located inside two recessed bucket windows outside the vacuum .",
    "the inner spacing of the two coil assemblies is 32 mm .",
    "the two pinch coils of the cloverleaf trap produce an axial curvature of @xmath8 g/@xmath9 per ampere and the leafs a radial gradient of @xmath10 g / cm per ampere . at typical operation conditions with 400 a in all coils and an offset field of 1.5 g",
    "we obtain for @xmath11rb trapped in the @xmath6 state trapping frequencies of 18 hz axially and 250 hz radially .",
    "the main goal of the setup described here is the investigation of rydberg atoms excited from bose - einstein condensates . for the manipulation and detection of the highly excited atoms we included eight field plates and two multi - channel plates ( mcp ) close to the atoms inside the vacuum .",
    "the details of this add - ons will be discussed in detail below . because of the arrangement of the field plates we had to relocate the radio - frequency coils used for evaporative cooling further away from the atoms as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ picmainchamber ] and fig .",
    "[ picmcpplatte ] .",
    "we use two coils made of polyimid coated copper wires consisting each of two loops .",
    "remanent charge on the insulating coating can cause disturbing electric fields if they are too close to the atoms , which is also avoided by the larger distance of the coils .",
    "nevertheless , the coils produce at the position of the atoms an average magnetic field of 5 mg ( for frequencies from 1 to 30 mhz ) , when driven with 2 w. this is sufficient to drive the magnetic dipole transitions for evaporative cooling .",
    "typically we perform evaporative cooling for 30 s on the magnetically trapped cloud until we reach the critical temperature @xmath12 at roughly 400 nk for the given trap parameters .",
    "the analysis of the bose condensed clouds is done after some time - of - flight with the absorption imaging technique . in fig .",
    "[ picbec ] a purely thermal cloud at @xmath13 is shown and a cloud at @xmath14 with a condensate fraction of 65 @xmath15 , both after a free expansion of 21 ms .",
    "the temperature of the cloud is obtained by fitting a gaussian distribution to the wings ( indicated by the vertical lines ) of the recorded density distribution .",
    "the width of the gaussian distribution determines then , with the knowledge of the free expansion time , the temperature of the cloud , assuming a point - like trapped cloud .",
    "apparently the atomic cloud at @xmath16 is not gaussian anymore .",
    "the bose enhancement plays already above @xmath12 a crucial role .",
    "the blue line is a fit to a bose distribution where the chemical potential was set to zero . from this fit",
    "we deduce the atom number in the thermal cloud for all temperatures below @xmath12 . in a next step",
    "we subtract the fitted bose distribution from the data and assign the remaining part to the bose - einstein condensate .",
    "the density distribution in thomas - fermi approximation follows a parabolic shape for a harmonic trapping potential . with this",
    "it is now possible to extract the condensate fraction , which is the number of atoms in the condensed phase divided by the total atom number . with the knowledge of the condensed atom number and",
    "the trapping frequencies all important parameters of the atomic cloud are determined .",

    "the excitation into rydberg states with principal quantum numbers ranging from n=20 up to the ionization threshold is accomplished by a two - photon excitation scheme . for a single photon excitation one",
    "has to use light at 297 nm , which is difficult to produce . in the two - photon excitation scheme",
    "the first laser is tuned close to resonance to a transition of the ground state to an intermediate state , from which the second photon takes the atom to the desired rydberg state .",
    "the polarizability of the intermediate state enhances the coupling of the ground state to the rydberg state . by choosing a sufficient large detuning with respect to",
    "the intermediate state one avoids population of the intermediate state and one obtains effectively a two level system . in our case",
    "we use as an intermediate state the @xmath21 state which corresponds to wavelengths at 780 nm and 480 nm . the red light ( 780 nm )",
    "is produced by a standard external cavity diode laser setup , whereas the blue light ( 480 nm ) is generated by frequency doubling laser light of a tapered amplifier at 960 nm .",

    "the two laser systems for the red ( 780 nm ) and the infrared ( 960 nm ) light , as well all elements for frequency stabilization are located in a separate room to increase the stability . by this",
    "we reached an overall line - width of the two photon excitation of about 1.5 mhz for excitation times above one millisecond . on the timescale of our experiments of several microseconds",
    "we measure a line - width of about 130 khz .",
    "the infrared light is brought to the laboratory by a polarization maintaining ( pm ) optical fiber , passes a tapered amplifier , a frequency doubling cavity ( ta - shg 110 , toptica photonics ag , germany ) and is finally guided by another pm - fiber to the experiment .",
    "a third pm - fiber takes the light at 780 nm to the experiment .",
    "our setup allows us to choose easily different laser frequencies for manifold experimental situations .",
    "the frequency of the 780 nm light is stabilized with a standard polarization spectroscopy method @xcite to any desired line or crossover of the @xmath22 transition manifold .",
    "before it enters the vacuum chamber , it passes an acousto - optical modulator ( aom ) in a double - pass configuration . with this aom",
    "we can switch the light within 20 ns and tune the frequency of the light by 200 mhz within the 3db bandwidth . in combination with the locking scheme we can tune the light right on any resonance , or detune it at most by 500 mhz with respect to any transition line of the @xmath22 manifold .",
    "the transfer cavity is used to stabilize the 960 nm light to the already stabilized 780 nm light @xcite .",
    "the 30 cm long cavity is made of stainless steel and has a mode spacing of 125 mhz .",
    "its length can be altered by a piezo actuator , which is used to stabilize the length of the cavity onto the transmission signal of the 780 nm light .",
    "we evacuated the cavity to avoid changes in the refractive index of the air due to atmospheric pressure and humidity .",
    "the master laser at 960 nm can now be stabilized to any mode of the cavity in steps of 125 mhz .",
    "a subsequent aom in double pass configuration allows us to scan the infrared light by 300 mhz , which corresponds to 600 mhz of the frequency doubled blue light at 480 nm . to scan a larger frequency region than available by the aom",

    "the red light at 780 nm is locked to a spectroscopy signal produced in a rubidium gas cell . ]",
    "the two laser beams for the two - photon excitation are spatially overlapped before entering the vacuum chamber at a dichroic mirror .",
    "the overlapped beams were aligned parallel to the z - axis , which is also the quantization axis of the magnetic trap .",
    "the polarization of both beams was set to @xmath23 respectively @xmath24 to maintain the magnetic moment of the atom and avoid frequency shifts due to magnetic fields . at the position of the atoms the 1/e@xmath25 radius of the 780 nm light was set to 550 m and the one at 480 nm to 35 m. the maximum available laser power in the blue light ( 480 nm ) is about 55 mw at the position of the atoms . in most experiments",
    "the power of the 780 nm light is reduced well below one milliwatt to avoid excitation into the @xmath21 state . at an detuning of 480 mhz ( see fig . [ picexcite ] ) and a typical laser power of e.g. 50 w the spontaneous scattering rate reduces to below one 1 khz .",

    "another important aspect the uniformity of the illumination of the atoms",

    "the electric field for the stark shift was produced by voltages on the field plates b and h , which were tuned from -15 v to + 15 v. all other field plates as well the cage of the mcp i were set to ground .",
    "the simulation of the emerging field gives in the geometric center a value of 0.14 v / cm per applied unit of voltage on field plate b and h. the orientation of the field is parallel to the x - axis .",
    "the intrinsic asymmetric configuration of the field exhibits additionally a gradient along the x - axis of 0.1 v/@xmath9 per applied unit volt .",
    "this field is superposed with an additional extraction field of the faraday cage of the mcp j , which was charged to -15 v. the calculated field remaining from the cage at the center is 0.2 v / cm plus a gradient of 2 v/@xmath9 .",
    "for detection of the rydberg atoms we switch after excitation the voltage on plate b and h to + 1000 v , which is sufficient for field ionization .",
    "the field configuration with the plates b and h at a positive voltage and the faraday cage at -15  v drags the positive ions towards the mcp for detection .",
    "the upper graph shows a theoretical calculation of the stark shift in the vicinity of @xmath51 .",
    "the arrow indicates the stark shift of the 43s state which we used in our measurements shown in the graph below . the solid blue line is a parabolic fit since a quadratic stark shift is expected .",
    "the red curves show the corresponding ion signal detected on the mcps . the center of masses",
    "are represented by the black dots . ]    as a sample for excitation we used an evaporatively cooled atomic cloud confined in the magnetic trap . at a temperature of 40 k",
    "the cloud is in the harmonic regime of the magnetic trap with a radial width of about 40 m. for such small clouds one can neglect the broadening of the spectroscopic lines due to inhomogeneties of the electric field . for the given parameters above , the broadening is less than two percent of the magnitude of the stark shift energy .    fig .",
    "[ picstarkmap ] shows the result on the measured stark shift .",
    "the parabolic fit ( blue line ) is shifted by 1.34 v with respect to 0 v , which is caused by the additional offset field of the faraday cage . at 0 v",
    "one gets a stark shift of 0.58 mhz which corresponds to an offset field of 0.27 v / cm ( calculated 0.2 v / cm ) .",
    "the curvature of the fitted parabola can be used to calibrate the electric field for the applied voltages at field plate b and h. to achieve 1 v / cm at the position of the atoms one has to apply 5 v at both field plates .",
    "the expected value from the theoretical calculation is 7.2 v. both deviations from the theoretical can be explained if the atomic cloud is shifted along the x - axis by a few millimeters away from the geometric center .",
    "more likely are imprecisions of the numerical calculations , since the parametrization of the full vacuum chamber geometry is not feasible .",
    "the spectroscopic lines ( plotted in red ) exhibit a broadening which is not independent of the applied electric field .",
    "there are two possible paths for the two photon transition @xmath52 .",
    "the desired transition ends in the @xmath53 state of the @xmath42 manifold , which is the only one allowed by the chosen polarizations .",
    "nevertheless , is the direction of the magnetic field adjacent to the trapping center not parallel to the z - axis and atoms can also be transferred to the @xmath54 which is not anymore insensitive to the magnetic field .",
    "the @xmath55 factor of the rydberg state is 2 and the total change in magnetic momentum is 2 @xmath56 .",
    "a calculation for the given parameters results in a broadening of about 3 mhz , which explains the observed linewidths very well .",
    "in this article , we have presented details of designing a setup which combines quantum degenerate gases with rydberg atoms . the capability of coherent excitation into specific rydberg states and their efficient detection with multichannel - plates establishes a new framework to study coherence properties of mesoscopic quantum systems .",
    "especially the tunability of the interaction strength and type among the rydberg atoms by either choosing a specific rydberg state or by applying electric fields make this a valuable system for many tasks .",
    "the first realization of coherent and collective excitation in a mesoscopic quantum system in the strong coupling regime has been achieved with this setup @xcite . there",
    "exist manifold options for further investigations .",
    "this could be studies on the coherence properties of nonclassical states , the dependence on system size and its geometry , signatures beyond mean - field theories and the feasibility of such systems for quantum information .",
    "funding of this setup was provided by the deutsche physikalischen gesellschaft in the schwerpunktprogramm ( sppp 1116 ) and by the sonderforschungsbereich sfb / tr 21 .",
    "the rydberg laser system was partly funded by the landesstiftung baden - wrttemberg .",
