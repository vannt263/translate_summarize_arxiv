    "unifying quantum mechanics @xcite-@xcite with general relativity @xcite is a major open problem in physics .",
    "after the unification of quantum mechanics and special relativity has been accomplished @xcite , in the resulting relativistic quantum field theories @xcite - @xcite , spacetime and quantum - mechanical degrees of freedom are still treated on a separate footing .",
    "for example , the electromagnetic , weak and strong forces are described as being mediated by particles , namely photons , @xmath0 and @xmath1-bosons , and gluons .",
    "an analogous consistent formulation of gravity has so far not succeeded . in order to overcome the schism between the theory of gravity on one side and quantum mechanics on the other",
    ", one may therefore ask : is there an element in the structure of quantum mechanics that forces spacetime into existence ?",
    "i.e. , is spacetime an emergent phenomenon , predicted by quantum mechanics ?    in the present paper , we approach this question in a restricted and controlled setting , with emphasis on the notion of time .",
    "namely , we study a scheme of quantum computation @xcite , so - called ` measurement - based ' or ` one - way ' quantum computation ( mbqc ) @xcite as a quantum - mechanical toy model for spacetime . in mbqc",
    ", the process of computation is driven by local measurements on a suitably chosen entangled state .",
    "` time ' in deterministic mbqc is a partial ordering of measurement events , which is compatible with the notion of time in the theory of relativity .",
    "an external and continuously increasing clock time is not required .",
    "the possible temporal orders are severely constrained by symmetries present in every mbqc .",
    "the exploration of these symmetry - enforced constraints is a central theme in this paper .",
    "a fundamental property of quantum mechanics is that measurement outcomes  as opposed to measurement bases  cannot be chosen .",
    "they are in general random .",
    "mbqc , which is driven by measurements ( no unitary evolution ever takes place in this computational scheme ) , were entirely useless if this randomness could not be prevented from creeping into the logical processing .",
    "but it can : all that is needed is the adjustment of measurement bases according to measurement outcomes obtained at other qubit locations _ before_. one can turn this mechanism for adjusting measurement bases around , and say that it is the inherently probabilistic nature of quantum measurement which determines the ` before ' in mbqc . indeed , without even knowing what is being computed in a given mbqc , the requirement of preventing the randomness of quantum mechanical measurement from affecting the logical processing imposes stringent constraints on the possible temporal orders of measurement events .",
    "it is because of this link between temporal order and quantum measurement that we propose mbqc as a quantum - mechanical toy model for spacetime .    in the context of the present work",
    ", it has previously been shown for the case the initial state in mbqc is a stabilizer state @xcite known in a suitable local basis , that the entire temporal order of measurements is fully specified if the set @xmath2 of first - measurable and the set @xmath3 of last - measurable qubits are known @xcite , @xcite .",
    "but not every pair @xmath2 , @xmath3 leads to a possible temporal order . a condition on admissible pairs @xmath2 ,",
    "@xmath3 has been given in @xcite .",
    "on a different route , an mbqc - analogue of closed time - like curves ( ctcs ) has been identified @xcite , via post - selection models @xcite , @xcite for ctcs in quantum circuits .",
    "certain solutions of the einstein equations permit closed time - like curves , and if mbqc is to serve as a toy model for a quantum spacetime it is a bonus that it accommodates this part of the phenomenology of general relativity .",
    "the results of the present paper are three - fold .",
    "first , we identify a gauge transformation leaving the classical output of all mbqcs invariant , and causing additional terms in the classical processing relations for measurement outcomes .",
    "we show that the resulting generalized processing relations fully specify the resource state and measurement setting , up to equivalence . in the reverse direction ,",
    "we provide a classification for all mbqc temporal relations compatible with a given resource stabilizer state and set of measurement bases .",
    "specifically , we introduce a matroid capturing all information of the resource state and measurement bases relevant for temporal order , and show that the classical processing relations  including temporal order  are in one - to - one correspondence with the bases of this matroid .",
    "second , we identify a further group of symmetry transformations generally changing mbqcs but preserving temporal order .",
    "the possible temporal orders in mbqc thus arise as representations of this group .",
    "these symmetry transformations turn out to be related to local complementation @xcite-@xcite .",
    "third , after light cones and closed time - like curves , we identify event horizons as a third piece of gr phenomenology that has a counterpart in mbqc .",
    "in this section we review some basic facts about measurement - based quantum computation , essential definitions for the discussion of mbqc temporal order , as well as previous work in this area .",
    "the scheme of mbqc itself , with a proof of its computational universality , is not reviewed here since various articles on this subject exist in the literature @xcite , @xcite - @xcite also , we require familiarity with the stabilizer formalism @xcite .      in mbqc ,",
    "the process of computation is driven by local ( = 1-qubit ) measurements on an initial highly entangled state , generally taken to be a so - called cluster state .",
    "the local measurements can only reduce entanglement , and therefore all entanglement needed for the computation must come from the initial state . for this reason , the initial state",
    "is often called the ` resource state ' .",
    "the computational power of a given mbqc strongly depends on the choice of the initial resource state .",
    "for example , a local resource state has obviously no computational power .",
    "other states may be used for a restricted class of computations . two - or - higher dimensional cluster states of unbounded size have the property that they enable universal quantum computation .",
    "that is , _ any _ quantum computation can be realized on such a state , by suitable choice of the local measurement bases .",
    "we now define graph states , to be used later on , and cluster states as a subclass thereof .",
    "be @xmath4 a graph with vertex set @xmath5 and edge set @xmath6 , such that there is one qubit for each vertex @xmath7 .",
    "then , the graph state @xmath8 is the unique ( up to global phase ) joint eigenstate , @xmath9 , for all @xmath7 , of the operators @xmath10 the cluster state @xmath11 is a graph state where the corresponding graph is a @xmath12-dimensional lattice @xmath13 .    in the standard scheme @xcite , the measured observables are of the form @xmath14=\\cos \\varphi_a\\ , \\sigma_x^{(a ) } + ( -1)^{q_a}\\sin \\varphi_a \\,\\sigma_y^{(a)},\\ ] ] with @xmath15 the qubit to which the measurement is applied , and @xmath16 depending on outcomes of ( earlier ) measurements on other qubit locations .",
    "as noted above , the temporal order of measurement in mbqc is a consequence of the randomness of measurement outcomes . by adjusting measurement bases according to measurement outcomes obtained on other qubits ,",
    "this randomness inherent in quantum mechanical measurement can be kept from creeping into the logical processing @xcite .",
    "if the measurement outcome of qubit @xmath15 influences the choice of measurement basis for qubit @xmath17 , clearly , qubit @xmath15 must be measured before qubit @xmath17 can .",
    "this is how a temporal order among the measurement events arises .",
    "we now generalize the above scenario of measuring observables of form eq .",
    "( [ obsxy ] ) on cluster states .",
    "namely , we now consider general stabilizer states @xmath18 as resources , with @xmath19 and stabilizer group @xmath20 .",

    "therein , the measurement angles @xmath23 are in the range @xmath24 , and @xmath25 may depend on measurement outcomes from several ( other ) qubits in @xmath26 .",

    "suppose on some qubit @xmath33 , instead of the `` desired '' post - measurement state @xmath34 the `` undesired '' post - measurement state @xmath35 has been obtained .",
    "the goal is to get the computation back on track by only adjusting the subsequent measurements . to do that , we require a stabilizer operator @xmath36 with the following properties @xcite : ( 1 ) @xmath37 has support only on @xmath15 and the yet unmeasured qubits , and ( 2 ) @xmath38 . recall that @xmath39 for the eigenstates @xmath40 of the local measured observable @xmath41 $ ] , c.f .",

    "then , @xmath44 therein , the first equality follows from @xmath36 , and the second from the above properties ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "since the overlaps between local states ( representing the local measurements ) with the resource state @xmath18 contain all information about the computation , we thus find that we can correct for `` undesired '' outcomes by ( a ) adjusting measurement bases of future measurements ( caused by tensor factors @xmath30 in @xmath45 ) and ( b ) re - interpretation of measurement outcomes ( caused by tensor factors @xmath31 in @xmath45 ) .",

    "first we consider the stabilizer operator @xmath56 .",
    "if inserted in the state overlap of eq .",
    "( [ corr1 ] ) , the measurement outcome of qubits 1 and 3 is flipped , as well as the measurement basis at qubit 2 .",
    "since qubits 2 and 3 are yet unmeasured when qubit 1 is measured , this is a valid correction operation for qubit 1 ; hence the notation @xmath57 .",
    "similarly , @xmath58 can be used as correction operation for qubit 2 .",
    "@xmath59 flips the measurement outcome of qubit 2 and the measurement basis of qubit 3 .",

    "@xmath57 does _ not _ affect the measurement basis at qubit 3 .",
    "only the meaning of the eigenstates is interchanged , which by itself does not require qubit 3 to be measured after qubit 1 .",
    "the interpretation of the measurement outcome may take place long after the measurement itself has taken place .",
    "@xmath63 implies that the measurement basis of qubit 3 depends on the measurement outcome of qubit 2 , and hence @xmath64 . both relations taken together",

    "( [ eqcirc ] ) one would expect one bit of classical output .",
    "indeed , if no correction operations need to be used , the eigenvalue measured at the output of the circuit corresponds to the eigenvalue @xmath65 measured on qubit 3 of the cluster .",
    "now recall that @xmath57 , applied conditioned upon @xmath66 , flips @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , with or without corrections , the eigenvalue measured in the circuit eq .",
    "( [ eqcirc ] ) equals @xmath67 . or , in binary notation @xmath68",
    ", the single bit of classical output takes the value @xmath69 .    note that we have not made any use of @xmath70 in the above argument .",
    "still , @xmath71 has a role to play , as we discuss in section  [ gauge ] .      to counteract the randomness of measurement outcomes , two measurement settings ( i.e. , bases ) per qubit suffice , which may be labeled by @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively , for each qubit @xmath15 .",

    "the set of all qubits @xmath17 whose measurement basis must be adjusted according to the measurement outcome on @xmath15 is denoted as the _ forward cone _ of a qubit @xmath15 .",
    "similarly , the backward cone of a qubit @xmath17 is the set of all those qubits @xmath15 whose measurement outcome influence the measurement basis at @xmath17 . more formally , with eq .",

    "however , such a computation could not be run deterministically in a world like ours where time progresses linearly .",
    "an mbqc is _ deterministically runnable _ if the temporal relation `` @xmath95 '' between the measurement events is a strict partial order .",
    "a strict partial order is a relation among the elements @xmath33 with the following properties",
    "@xmath96    [ iodef ] for a given mbqc , the input set @xmath97 is the set of qubits whose backward cones are empty , @xmath98 .",
    "the output set @xmath99 is the set of qubits whose forward cones are empty , @xmath100 .",

    "that is , every qubit in @xmath26 is measured .",
    "then , as a consequence of the randomness of individual measurement outcomes , the classical output @xmath101 of an mbqc is given by _ correlations _ among measurement outcomes .",
    "again , the relation between classical output and measurement outcomes is linear , @xmath102 for a suitable binary matrix @xmath1 .",
    "_ example : _ to illustrate the above notions , we briefly return to the three - qubit cluster state example of section  [ oto ] . from the previous discussion we find that @xmath103 therefore , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 .",

    "the following question is asked : `` given graph @xmath4 and the set @xmath115 of measurement planes for all vertices , can the temporal order of measurements in mbqc with a graph state @xmath8 be uniquely reconstructed from this information ? ''",
    "the graph @xmath4 and the measurement planes @xmath115 are undirected objects .",
    "thus , if the answer to this question was yes , then temporal order in mbqc were truly emergent .",
    "however , it turns out that the pair @xmath116 does not specify the temporal order of measurements in mbqc uniquely ; there are in general a number of consistent temporal orders respecting the requirement that the randomness of measurement outcomes should not affect the logical processing .",
    "one may then ask how constraining on temporal order this requirement actually is . to this question ,",
    "the following answer is provided by @xcite : if in addition to @xmath4 and @xmath115 the set @xmath2 of first - measurable and the set @xmath3 of last - measurable qubits is known , then the complete temporal order ( if existing ) can be uniquely reconstructed from this information .",
    "thus , mbqc temporal order is not emergent in the strict sense ; a seed @xmath117 must be provided in addition to @xmath4 and @xmath115 , and the complete temporal order then follows .",
    "but not every pair @xmath2 , @xmath3 will lead to a consistent temporal order .",
    "the question that now arises is which pairs @xmath117 do . for the case where the stabilizer resource state is a graph state and all qubits",
    "are measured in the @xmath118$]-plane then the answer to this question is given in @xcite .",

    "then , the pair @xmath117 leads to a partial order of measurement events in mbqc iff there exists a matrix @xmath80 such that @xmath123 , and @xmath80 is free of cycles ( that is @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , etc ) .",
    "the resulting temporal order is generated by @xmath80 under transitivity .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     here we introduce the notion of `` gauge transformations '' acting on a given quantum computation .",
    "these transformations exist for both the circuit model and mbqc .      to obtain an intuition for the gauge transformations introduced here , it is instructive to first inspect them in the circuit model .",
    "specifically , we consider a quantum circuit which consists of ( 1 ) the preparation of the quantum register in the initial state @xmath127 , ( 2 ) unitary evolution composed of , say , cnot gates and one - qubit rotations about the @xmath128- and @xmath1-axes , and ( 3 ) local measurements for readout .",
    "such a circuit is displayed in fig .",
    "[ gt ] above .",
    "then , into every qubit line individually , we may insert an identity @xmath129 next to the input ; see fig .",
    "the left @xmath130 is propagated backwards in time until absorbed by the input state @xmath131 .",
    "the right @xmath130 is propagated forward in time , flipping rotation angles and readout - measurement outcomes in the passing .",
    "this transformation is an _ equivalence transformation _ , since it is caused by the insertion of an identity gate into the circuit of fig .",
    "the reason we call it a gauge transformation is that it changes reference frames for certain rotation angles . specifically , for the rotation gates next to each input qubit we can individually choose our convention for which rotation angles are called positive or negative , respectively .",
    "once those signs are fixed on the input side , they are fixed throughout the circuit .      translating the above discussed gauge transformations from the circuit model into mbqc",
    "it is easily seen that the above relations eq .",
    "( [ to1 ] ) and ( [ to1b ] ) are incomplete .",
    "we find the more general relations    @xmath132    with @xmath133 a choice of gauge .    under a change of @xmath133 , the measurement bases in a particular mbqc change , but",
    "the probability distribution for the classical output values remains unchanged .",
    "of course , knowledge of the @xmath133-dependent extra parts in eq .",
    "( [ to7a],[to7b ] ) is not necessary to run any given mbqc , since @xmath134 is always a valid choice .",
    "however , the presence of the extra terms in the processing relations strengthens their interdependence with the resource state , which is the reason why we discuss them here .",
