    "<S> they differ from those obtained in the overdamped limit , but like the former exhibit jumps that mirror the sudden change in temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated that the curzon - ahlborn efficiency is the universal efficiency at maximum power due to the linear heat transport implicit in the weak coupling limit . </S>",
    "<S> we have further shown that reducing the power slightly below its maximum value leads to disproportionately large gains in efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> our findings confirm that maximizing the efficiency at maximum power is not always the best way to design machines with both high efficiency and high power .    </S>",
