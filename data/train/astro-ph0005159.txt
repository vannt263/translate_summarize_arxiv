    "the main facts about broad emission line regions ( belrs ) of agns can be summarized as follow : * ( a ) ubiquity : * broad emission lines ( bels ) are probably ubiquitous in agn , being unobserved only when a good case exists for their obscuration by dust ( type 2 agn ) or their being swamped by beamed continuum ( blazars ) .",
    "this suggests that the presence of broad emission line clouds ( belcs ) in the agn environment is closely related to the mechanisms which are responsible for the quasar activity . *",
    "( b ) photoionization : * reverberation studies of the bels in many seyfert 1 galaxies ( e.g. wandel , peterson & malkan , 1999 : hereinafter wpm99 ) indicate that the gas of the belcs is photoionized , and that its physical state , from one object to another , covers a rather narrow range of parameter space ( in column density , electron density , ionization parameter ) . * ( c ) virialization : * within a single object the belcs are stratified , with the highest ionization lines being also the broadest ( krolik et al . , 1991 ; peterson et al . , 1999 ) .",
    "this accords with the photoionization hypothesis and with the idea that the bels are broadened by their orbital keplerian motion around the central source ( peterson & wandel , 1999 ) . *",
    "( d ) wide range of velocity : * bels do not at all have the same dynamical properties in all objects . a broad distribution of line widths from @xmath1 km s@xmath2 ( in narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies , nlsy1 )",
    "to @xmath3 km s@xmath2 ( in the broadest broad line type 1 agn ) is present .",
    "here we briefly present a model ( nicastro , 2000 , hereinafter n00 ) , based on the keplerian assumption and which links the existence of the belrs with the mechanism responsible for the quasar activity : accretion onto a massive black hole .",
    "formulae , numerical details and definitions can be found in n00 . the model explains naturally ( a ) the ubiquity of bels in agns , and ( b ) the wide ( but limited ) range of velocities observed .",
    "stratification in a single object can also be , at least partly , accounted for by this model .",
    "we adopt the scenario described by witt , czerny and zycki ( 1997 , hereinafter wcz97 ) , and its recent revision ( a. rozanska and b. czerny 2000 , in preparation ) .",
    "these authors studied a radially co - accreting disk / corona system and demonstrated that a transonic vertical outflow from the disk develops where the fraction of total energy dissipated in the corona is close to the maximum , and for accretion rates higher than a minimum value , below which evaporation inhibits the formation of the wind . in the framework of this model , and",
    "consistent with the empirical quasar structure presented by elvis ( 2000 ) at this conference , we propose that a vertical disk / coronal wind , is the origin of the belcs and that the widths of the bels are the keplerian velocities of the accretion disk at the radius where this wind arises ( n00 ) . in our model",
    "the disk wind forms for external accretion rates higher than a minimum value @xmath4 ( in critical units ; see n00 for details ) below which a standard shakura - sunyaev ( 1973 , hereinafter ss73 ) disk ( i.e. ss - disk ) is stable and extends down to the last stable orbit .",
    "the model explains the observed range of fwhm in the bels of agn as a function of a single physical quantity connected with the agn activity : the accretion rate .    *",
    "width of the broad emission lines : *    we adopt an average radius @xmath5 for the transonic outflow ( and so for the belrs ) , obtained by weighting the radial distance by @xmath6 , between @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( see equations 1 - 3 in n00 for appropriate definitions ) . in figure 1",
    "we show the relationship between the accretion rate ( in the range @xmath9 ) and the expected fwhm@xmath10 ( solid , thick curves ) and fwhm(@xmath8 ) ( dashed , thin curves ) , for @xmath11 based on the keplerian assumption .",
    "these curves are independent of the mass of the central black hole , and so they overlap in the diagram of figure 1 . however , for each curve , the maximum achievable fwhm depends on the mass , via the limit imposed by the minimum external accretion rate @xmath4 needed for an unstable ss - disk to exist . at the bottom of the plot",
    "the four horizontal lines indicate these values of @xmath4 .",
    "the parameter space between the dashed and solid curves of figure 1 gives a range of @xmath12 in fwhm ( i.e. @xmath13 in radius ) for a given accretion rate , so allowing , at least partly , for a stratification of the belcs in a single object . for accretion rates",
    "@xmath14 ( sub - eddington regime ) the predicted fwhm are quite broad ( @xmath15 km s@xmath2 ) , and similar to those typically observed in broad line type 1 agn ( figure 1 ) . for @xmath16 ( eddington to moderately super - eddington ) the corresponding fwhm span the interval @xmath17 km s@xmath2 , which contains the value of fwhm@xmath18 km s@xmath2 used to separate normal type 1 agn and nlsy1 .",
    "hence our model predicts that narrow line type 1 agn accrete at higher accretion rates compared to broad line objects , as suggested by pounds et al .",
    "however , the mass of the central black hole in nlsy1 does not need to be smaller than that of broad line type 1 agn .",
    "no instability is possible for @xmath19 thus providing an upper limit of @xmath20 km s@xmath2 for the bel fwhm .    * relative radiative efficiency : *    using the predictions of our model , and the recent measurements of distances and fwhm reported by wandel , peterson and malkan ( 1999 ) for a sample of 19 type 1 agns",
    ", we calculate the ratio @xmath21 between the measured ( wpm99 ) dimensionless luminosity @xmath22 and the predicted accretion rate .",
    "@xmath21 is then a measure of the relative efficiency ( compared to the maximum radiative efficiency @xmath23 : @xmath24 , where @xmath25 ) by which the accretion power is converted into ionizing luminosity .",
    "we found that @xmath21 is correlated with the measured mass of the central black hole ( see figure 3 in n00 ) .",
    "this observational result is not an obvious consequence of our model and needs further study .",
    "this correlation may explain why we do not see very - low mass agn ( @xmath26 m@xmath27 ) : the efficiency in converting accretion power into luminosity may be too low to observe such objects .",
    "we presented a simple model which tightly links the existence of the belcs in type 1 agn to the accretion mechanism ( n00 ) .",
    "we identify the belr with a vertically outflowing wind of ionized matter which forms at a critical radius in the accretion disk , consistent with the model for quasar structure presented by elvis ( 2000 ) at this conference .",
    "our main findings are : ( a ) the entire observed range of velocities ( fwhm ) in type 1 agn is naturally reproduced in our model by allowing the accretion rate to vary from its minimum permitted value to super - eddington rates ; ( b ) for accretion rates close to the eddington value , the expected fwhm are of the order of those observed in nlsy1 .",
    "lower accretion rates give instead fwhm typical of broad line type 1 agn .",
    "( c ) we find an empirical relationship which suggests that the radiative efficiency of higher mass black holes is greater than that for lower mass black holes ."
