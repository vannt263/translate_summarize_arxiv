    "the origin of this uv radiation field that re - ionized the early universe was considered by @xcite .",
    "quasars are known to be strong contributors to the cosmic uv background , as their spectra show little intrinsic fall - off across the lyman limit ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite calculated the diffuse ultraviolet radiation field using assumptions about the quasar luminosity function and the shape of the intrinsic uv spectrum of quasars .",
    "they also discussed the possibility that young galaxies could be significant contributors to the uv background .",
    "in addition to measuring the lyman continuum from sources directly , the strength of the uv background may be inferred using the  proximity effect \"  the trend toward smaller number densities of ly@xmath7 lines in a quasar absorption spectrum as one approaches the redshift of a background quasar . using this method",
    "@xcite calculated a larger uv background than the integrated emission of known quasars at z @xmath8 3 , requiring ",
    "appreciable sources of ionizing photons other than quasars \" .",
    "since quasars have a lower space density than galaxies , the ionizing photons from more uniformly distributed normal galaxies would set a floor on the _ fluctuations _ in the ionizing background radiation from one location to another . a related method of estimating the uv background is by measurement of the ly@xmath7 forest decrement as a function of redshift @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that re - radiation from intergalactic absorption systems acts as sources , as well as sinks , of ionizing photons which affect the amplitude , shape , and fluctuations of the uv background .",
    "they find this stochastic reprocessing of quasar light appears to provide enough ionizing photons to account for the proximity effect at high redshifts .",
    "_ redward _ of the lyman limit most of the diffuse cosmic uv radiation comes from the numerous normal galaxies , particularly those with high instantaneous star formation rates , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "_ blueward _ of the lyman limit , the amount of ionizing photons from hot stars that escape normal galaxies is not well known on either theoretical or observational grounds .",
    "locally it is poorly measured because of our inability to detect it through the hi absorption of the milky way .",
    "the intrinsic spectra of hot stars around the lyman limit are also not accurately measured @xcite .",
    "if even small amounts of radiation blueward of the lyman limit escape from normal galaxies ( e.g. , @xmath6 10% of their mid - uv flux ) , then ( in aggregate ) galaxies could still be the dominant source of the uv background @xcite researchers use the term  escape fraction \" in several model - dependent ways .",
    "the most conceptually straightforward definition is the number of ionizing photons escaping the galaxy divided by the total number of ionizing photons emitted by stars within it , i.e. , f@xmath9 = n@xmath9/n@xmath10 .",
    "however , to avoid any dependence on models , the _ observed _ limit of 1500 to 900   flux is sometimes quoted , for comparison with the value which would be expected if all ionizing photons escaped .",

    "steidel , pettini and adelberger ( 2001 , spa ) reported the detection of lyman continuum flux in the composite spectrum of 29 lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) with @xmath16 = 3.4 .",

    "the lower redshift bound was selected to put all emission redward of 912@xmath5 out of our detection passband .",
    "the upper redshift limit was chosen to minimize the effects of intergalactic absorption .",
    "we further selected among the candidates based upon colors , choosing the bluest , brightest , galaxies , since the sensitivity of our search is directly proportional to the strength of the flux emitted just longward of the lyman limit .",
    "we avoided all targets that might be active galaxies based upon the presence of high - ionization emission lines ( e.g. , other than [ o ii ] at 3727@xmath5 ) .",
    "because of the sharply decreasing numbers of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies as z increases towards 2 , our brightest candidates were found in the redshift interval 1.1 @xmath0 z @xmath0 1.4 .",
    "given the limited photometry available for most of these galaxies , they were in effect selected based upon their brightness in the shortest observed passband , be that u or b. four cfrs galaxies were selected for their brightness in v , combined with their extremely blue v - i colors .",
    "our sample size of eleven was a compromise between examining a large enough number of sources to account for possible line - of - sight ( los ) variations and integrating long enough on each object to set very significant flux limits .",
    "several different geometric possibilities exist by which normal galaxies could be significant cosmic contributors of ionizing photons : a ) most galaxies emit lyman continuum isotropically , but at a low level ; b ) most of them emit virtually no lyman continuum photons _ except _ along a few , unusually clear lines - of - sight ; or c ) most of them emit virtually no lyman continuum photons whatsoever , but a minority of special galaxies ( e.g. , irregular or disturbed galaxies ) do emit .",

    "the sky background we observed was small , typically @xmath6 0.1 counts per 3000 seconds ( somewhat higher than the dark current ) .",

    "sensitivity variations across the fov were corrected by dividing the images by standard flatfield calibration frames . as noted in the stis manual ,",
    "there are smooth but reproducible variations across the field . in our case those peaked at roughly a 15% increase in sensitivity near the upper left edge of the field .",

    "as viewed at intermediate redshifts , the small angular size of galaxies concentrates their light on only a small number of fuv mama pixels .",

    "measurements of ssa22 - 16 , ssa22 - 10 ( a compact galaxy ) , and ssa22 - 20 ( a relatively isolated object in the upper left of the image ) gave us a half radius for compact galaxies of 5 fuv mama pixels , appropriate for marginally resolved objects close in angular size to the psf of the camera .",
    "in what follows , we quote some results for the smaller angular size compact galaxies but , conservatively , our tables and flux limits are specified for normal - size galaxies at these redshifts .",
    "unlike at higher - redshifts , the opacity of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is not significant at the redshifts we are observing .",
    "quasar absorption features can be used to estimate the decrement due to h i absorption as a function of wavelength and redshift @xcite . at z = 1.2 the ly@xmath7 line density per unit redshift , normalized for rest ew = 0.24@xmath5 , is @xmath6 35 . integrating over line equivalent width produces ew(integrated ) @xmath6 10@xmath5 of absorption at a wavelength of 1200@xmath5 .",
    "thus the resulting continuum flux decrement is @xmath6 1% , negligible compared to our other sources of error , with ly@xmath7 being the major opacity source .",
    "we note that the corresponding uncertainty in correcting for igm absorption at a redshift of 3 is far larger , and seriously affects conclusions about escape of ionizing photons from galaxies at that high a redshift .",
    "corrections were made for the effects of milky way extinction . using the irsky tool ( www.ipac.caltech.edu/ipac/services/irsky.html ) we computed the ir sky backgrounds for our target fields , and applied the scaling e@xmath26 = 0.018 x i@xmath27(mjy / sr ) @xcite .",

    "this suggests an inverse wavelength squared dependence in f@xmath31 , or a flat spectrum in f@xmath34 , probably from a quasar .",
    "we compared the radial growth of the number of counts in the two detected sources with each other and with wfpc2 images we had on hand of our targeted intermediate - redshift galaxies .",
    "we used these observed profiles to estimate how the fuv light from our target galaxies should have been distributed spatially to better estimate our upper limits .",
    "the two sources had quite similar curves of growth , with half of the counts contained within a radius of @xmath6 20 pixels .",
    "not unexpectedly , the light is less concentrated in the centers of our detected sources than it is in the wfpc2 images of our targeted intermediate - redshift galaxies .",

    "information on pointing error for stis was not available , but was determined for wfpc2 to be 0.86 arc seconds .",
    "this error , combined with the uncertainty in the positional coordinates , means one can only coregister these images to on the order of a typical normal galaxy diameter at these redshifts .",
    "in fact , a couple of marginally significant signals were detected in the co - added image , but these were _ not _ at the center of the fov where the galaxies were targeted .",
    "they were off - center and appear to be low - level blemishes in the stis camera .",

    ", our new lyman continuum upper limits suggests that galaxies make up less than 15% , and possibly less than 2% , of the cosmic ultraviolet background . while less than 16% of the ionizing flux escaped from these _ bluest _ of galaxies , it is possible that this upper limit will be even lower for the general population of galaxies at 1.1 @xmath0 z @xmath0 1.4 .",

    "it remains possible that at higher redshifts , higher star formation rates occuring on global scales produce interstellar media that may leak ionizing radiation .",
    "in addition , as was pointed out by @xcite , the lyman break galaxy composite spectrum employed by spa showed signs of outflow in the 400 to 500 km sec@xmath4 blueshifted interstellar absorption lines .",
    "such outflows may be a necessary signature of galaxies leaking ionizing radiation , but we do not know how strong such a signature is in our target galaxies .",

    "_ if _ , however , galaxies at redshifts of 2 or 3 behave similarly to the galaxies we measured at z @xmath6 1.2 , galaxies would contribute less than 20% as much ultraviolet light as would quasars , and the flux estimates from both sources would be consistent with the predictions of the proximity effect .",
    "based on observations of eleven bright blue galaxies with redshifts 1.1 @xmath0 z @xmath0 1.4 , _ no _ lyman continuum was detected . a stringent , model - independent , upper limit @xmath0 2@xmath110@xmath2 ergs @xmath3 sec@xmath4 @xmath14 was obtained for the fuv flux escaping from eleven normal galaxies at redshifts of 1.1 @xmath0 z @xmath0 1.4 . given reasonable assumptions about the fuv flux from these galaxies , based on bruzual - charlot models , this represents less than 6% , down to less than 1% , of their intrinsic ionizing flux .",
