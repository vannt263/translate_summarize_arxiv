    "star formation is driven by complicated interactions between gas and stars .",
    "untangling the interplay between these processes is difficult , because in most cases , the events that trigger star formation are not obvious , nor are those that shape the structure and dynamics of the ism . for a full understanding it is therefore indispensable to obtain a comprehensive view of all processes that come together to form stars , stellar associations , and stellar clusters .",
    "observationally , one requires knowledge of the gas distribution and kinematics as well as the stellar energy input into the ism over time .    in recent years",
    ", large systematic surveys have made superb progress on the first of these requirements .",
    "the number of nearby galaxies for which high - quality  data is available has dramatically increased in the last few years , including campaigns such as things (  the nearby galaxy survey  ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , figgs (  faint irregular galaxies gmrt survey  ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , little - things (  little : local irregulars that trace luminosity extremes  ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and halogas (  the westerbork hydrogen accretion in local galaxies  ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the difficult work of mapping the molecular medium in the brighter galaxies has begun as well , e.g. in bima song (  the bima survey of nearby galaxies  * ?",
    "* ) , heracles , (  the hera co line extragalactic survey  ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and sting (  carma survey toward infrared - bright nearby galaxies  ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "unfortunately , the needed measurements of time - resolved stellar energy input are more difficult to acquire . large systematic surveys in the far - ultraviolet ( e.g. , obtained with the _ galex _ telescope ) and the far - infrared ( e.g. , the local volume legacy survey ( lvl ; * ?",
    "* ) , sings (  spitzer infrared nearby galaxies survey  ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , kingfish , etc ) have made excellent progress in measuring the recent star formation rate ( sfr ) , while surveys like 11hugs (  the 11mpc h@xmath5 uv galaxy survey  ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have provided the h@xmath5 mapping needed to trace star formation ( sf ) on much shorter timescales . however , these approaches to measuring star formation lack all but the broadest time resolution , with the different tracers being sensitive to sf over different timescales .",
    "h@xmath5 is emitted on the timescale of o - star lifetimes ( @xmath6myr ) and the far - ultraviolet on the timescale of a - star lifetimes ( @xmath7myr ) .",
    "the far - infrared is sensitive to timescales similar to the @xmath7myr of far - ultraviolet heating .",
    "these timescales are not necessarily well - matched to the relevant energy input timescales for the gas .    for the survey presented here , we take a different approach , and focus  observations on galaxies which are sufficiently close that their stellar populations can be resolved with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) . the resulting color ",
    "magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) allow one to construct spatially - resolved star formation histories ( sfhs ) via analyses of galaxies stellar populations , and thus reveal the time - resolved sfr of these nearby galaxies over timescales of several hundred myr at @xmath8 spatial resolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . with nearly 300 orbits of _ hst",
    "_ time , one of the most ambitious programs to obtain spatially - resolved sfhs is the acs nearby galaxy survey treasury program ( angst ; * ? ? ?",
    "the angst observations enable to map spatially - resolved sfhs for a volume - limited sample of 69 nearby ( @xmath9mpc ) galaxies , probing both group and field environments .",
    "these data provide an entirely new , statistically significant view on the sfh of the local universe dwarf galaxy population .",
    "the survey presented here , vla - angst ( `` very large array survey of acs nearby galaxy survey treasury galaxies '' ) , complements angst with high spatial and spectral resolution data cubes of the atomic gas traced by the 21 cm line of neutral atomic hydrogen ( ) .",
    "vla - angst was designed to aim for the best available resolution and sensitivity , using the nrao very large array ( vla ) in multiple configurations in a large program worth @xmath10hours of observing time to achieve that goal .",
    "vla - angst is designed to match the  spatial resolution ( @xmath11 ) to the cell sizes over which the sfhs can be determined .",
    "furthermore , the majority of the vla - angst galaxies were observed at very high spectral resolution of @xmath12 km  s@xmath1  which is important for detailed ism dynamic modeling studies of the rather low - mass objects which dominate the galaxy population within @xmath13mpc .",
    "the vla - angst survey has a number of features that make it a valuable addition to the many other  surveys , beyond the existence of resolved stellar population data .",
    "first , the galaxies in vla - angst are all quite close , which ensures high linear resolution for studying small - scale features in the  distribution . second , because care was taken to match the observational setups of things , the vla - angst survey can be readily combined with the things survey , giving much broader coverage towards low galaxy masses .",
    "when further combined with surveys like little - things and shield , which have used a similar observational strategy , we will have a relatively uniform database of toward @xmath14 objects spanning a large variety of galaxy types that is comparable in terms of sensitivity , angular , and spectral resolution .",
    "the variety of galaxy types in the sample allows the study of ( 1 ) the response of gas and star formation to the propagation of spiral arms and to interactions , as seen in massive spirals and starburst galaxies ( 2 ) star formation propagation in the absence of strong perturbations of the gas density ; gas rich dwarves are ideal for such a study due to their lack of internal shear and spiral density waves ( 3 ) star formation triggered in unusual kinematic environments such as in tidal dwarfs , and ( 4 ) dirr / dsph transition - type galaxies , whose lack of current sf but ample gas reservoirs allow studies of galaxies that possess the raw material for star formation , but somehow remain dormant .    in the following",
    "we present the data of the vla - angst survey , and in - depth scientific analyses will follow in subsequent publications .",
    "first analyses based on vla - angst data cubes are provided by @xcite on the energy requirements of large holes , by @xcite on the distribution of cold and warm , and by @xcite on the global  velocity dispersion profiles correlated to the properties of the galaxies .",
    "section[sec : sample ] describes the selection of the targets , followed by the observational setup and data reduction ( section[sec : reduction ] ) .",
    "our data products are presented in section[sec : dataproducts ] and a summary of the vla - angst given in section[sec : summary ] .",
    "the angst survey targeted a complete volume - limited sample of 69 galaxies .",
    "the volume consists of those galaxies above a galactic latitude of @xmath15 @xmath16 20@xmath17 , outside the local group but within 3.5 mpc , with additional cones out to 4 mpc in the directions of the m81 and sculptor groups .",
    "this volume provides a wide variety of gas - rich galaxies of all morphological types ( sb , dirr , dsph / de types , and tidal dwarfs ) , spanning a range of 10 magnitudes in luminosity , 10@xmath18 in current star formation rate ( sfr ) , and 1.3 dex in metallicity .    to complement the angst hst data with interferometric observations , for vla - angst we selected a sub - sample of angst targets that comprises galaxies with known  content and galaxies with indications of recent star formation , even if  was not previously detected by single dish observations .",
    "we excluded galaxies that are too far south for the vla ( @xmath19 ) and galaxies that were previously covered by things .    due to the volume limited nature of angst , most of the objects that fit our selection criteria are rather low - mass , low - luminosity dwarf galaxies .",
    "an exception is the angst galaxy ngc253 , a massive barred starburst galaxy . the  properties of ngc253 , in particular its large linewidth , are very different to the rest of our sample and can only be adequately observed with the new correlator capabilities of the upgraded karl g. jansky very large array .",
    "thus , we excluded the massive starburst galaxy ngc253 from our sample . in total , the vla - angst sample amounts to 35 galaxies , approximately half the objects that comprise the entire angst _ hst _ survey .",
    "we list all vla - angst galaxies and their basic properties in table[tab : sample ] .",
    "column ( 1 ) contains the galaxy names , and column ( 2 ) a range of alternative names as found on the `` nasa / ipac extragalactic database '' ( ned ) .",
    "columns ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) are the central equatorial j2000 coordinates , followed by the distance @xmath20 of the galaxies in column ( derived using the tip of the red giant branch [ trgb ] method ) ( 5 ) . the optical diameters at 25mag@xmath21 ( d@xmath22 ) surface brightness and the absolute @xmath23 magnitudes @xmath24 are listed in columns ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) , respectively . columns ( 8) contains the galaxies 3.6@xmath25 m infrared luminosities , which is a rough measure for the old , unobscured stellar population , followed by the morphological types in numerical code according to @xcite taken from @xcite in column ( 9 ) .",
    "finally , we list the uv - based star formation rate in column ( 10 ) .    in the vla - angst sample ,",
    "29 galaxies are classified as t - type = 10 , 2 as t - type = 9 , 1 as t - type = 7 , 1 as t - type = @xmath263 , and 2 as t - type = @xmath263 , where negative t - types are early type galaxies and positive t - types are late - type galaxies .",
    "gas - rich irregulars are at the upper end of the -10 to 10 scale .",
    "six galaxies were not detected in our  observations .",
    "the two galaxies classified as t - type = @xmath263 were non - detections , and the other 4 non - detections were t - type = 10 .",
    "ddo82 was a single dish  non - detection but we detected the atomic hydrogen gas in vla - angst .",
    "fig.[fig : histo ] shows the distributions of vla - angst galaxies as a function of distance , t - type , logarithmic stellar mass ( based on the @xmath27@xmath25 m emission ) , and logarithmic  mass , as compared to the things sample .",
    "vla - angst galaxies are on average more nearby , late type , and low mass galaxies , both in terms of stellar and mass .",
    "the vla - angst sample is thus much more dominated by low - mass dwarf irregulars and thus provides a complementary sample to things .",
    "comparison with little things and shield are shown in fig.[fig : surveys ] . given the volume filling sample selection constraints , the vla - angst galaxies are much more tightly located at distances of @xmath28mpc , whereas little things and shield have a larger distance spread .",
    "galaxy sizes are also broader distributed in little things as compred to vla - angst .",
    "little things galaxies are on average brighter and shield galaxies are at the faint end of optical absolute @xmath23 magnitudes when compared to the vla - angst sample .",
    "little things contains more -massive galaxies than vla - angst and shield is again at the fainter  end .",
    "we include the shield vla pilot galaxies in this plot , which are brighter than the proper shield targets ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the high mass end of the final shield  mass distribution is thus somewhat fainter than depicted in fig.[fig : surveys ] .",
    "the vast majority of the observations in vla - angst are new . in a few cases ,",
    "archival data were used in place of obtaining new observations to improve efficiency . here",
    "we describe both the new and archival observations .      the parameters for our new observations and the subsequent data reduction strategy closely followed the design of the things survey @xcite , with the goal of obtaining comparable sensitivity and spatial resolution .",
    "a significant difference between the two surveys , however , is the @xmath29 times better velocity resolution of vla - angst .",
    "each of the vla - angst galaxies was observed with the nrao s vla in the b- ( 9h total observing time per galaxy ) , c- ( 3h ) , and d- ( 3h ) array configurations ( under project code ao215 ) .",
    "the compact d - configuration exhibits the largest number of short baselines with antenna separations down to 35 m .",
    "d - configuration is thus the most sensitive antenna configuration to image spatial scales of up to @xmath30 , which is the maximum for the vla at 1.4ghz .",
    "the addition of b - configuration observations yield spatial resolutions @xmath31 or @xmath4pc for the nearby ( @xmath32mpc ) objects .",
    "this scale is necessary to compare star forming regions with their counterparts and matches well the resolution of surveys at other wavelengths such as lvl ( spitzer ) and 11hugs ( galex ) .",
    "the southern sources ngc3109 , ngc247 , antlia , and ddo6 were observed mostly in the hybrid bna- , cnb- , and dnc - array configurations that feature elongated placements of the antennas along the northern arm .",
    "the projected baselines of these antenna configurations produce a more circular beam toward southern targets .    at the time of the observations ,",
    "2007 october to 2008 august , the vla was in the process of being upgraded evla .",
    "this transition implied that the observations were taken with a mix of already converted evla and original vla antennas .",
    "the conversion period mostly affected the signal distribution from the front - ends to the correlator . at the time , the old vla correlator was still in use , and we configured it in the 2ac or 2ad modes to capture both rr and ll polarization products .",
    "doppler tracking in the transition phase would have introduced phase jumps on baselines involving evla antennas .",
    "consequently , we calculated and fixed the appropriate observing frequency for each observing run such that the  emission line was well placed within a vla bandpass at the start of an observation ( doppler setting ) .",
    "line shifts during a single observation are minimal ( @xmath33 km  s@xmath1 ) and are corrected in post - processing (  .[ssec : calibration ] ) .",
    "the observational parameters for each galaxy were based on its linewidth as taken from single dish  spectra , plus @xmath34% additional line free channels to enable a good continuum subtraction . to reach our goal of the best possible velocity resolution",
    ", we used a correlator mode with 0.78mhz bandwidth and 256 channels for 15 galaxies in our sample .",
    "this corresponds to a channel width of @xmath35 km  s@xmath1  over a total velocity range of @xmath36 km  s@xmath1  after cropping about 20% edge channels , 10% on each side .",
    "eight galaxies had wider  linewidths and were therefore observed with a bandwidth of 1.56mhz and 256 channels ( @xmath37 km  s@xmath1  velocity range and @xmath38 km  s@xmath1  channel width ; see table[tab : dataproperties ] ) .",
    "the systemic velocity of kk77 is unknown . to maximize on the range of velocities for this source",
    ", we used the 4if mode for this galaxy , a correlator mode that enables observing with two simultaneous frequencies .",
    "ngc247 was also observed in the 4if mode because of its extreme  linewidth of @xmath39 km  s@xmath1 , by far the widest line of our sample . in the presence of extremely strong , narrow line features , the response of",
    "the vla can include signs of the gibbs phenomenon , a _",
    "function that oscillates between channels .",
    "this oscillation can be suppressed by `` hanning '' smoothing the data with a triangular smoothing kernel .",
    "we decided not to use online hanning smoothing as the lines are too weak to show any signs of the gibbs phenomenon .",
    "some of the archival observations that we added in , however , were observed with online hanning smoothing turned on .",
    "we also applied a 25mhz frontend filter to reduce the impact on radio frequency interference ( rfi ) in our data .    for flux and bandpass calibration purposes , we observed the vla standard flux calibrators 3c286 and/or 3c48 ( with fluxes of @xmath40jy and @xmath41jy , respectively ) depending on their visibility at the time of the observations .",
    "typical integration times were 12minutes on the flux calibrator , split between the beginning and end of a track .",
    "we observed our target galaxies in 40minute intervals alternating with 3minutes on a nearby phase / complex gain calibrator .",
    "the complex gain calibrators were chosen to be nearby point sources with a minimum flux of @xmath42jy .",
    "b - configuration observations were obtained in single 9hour programs , or , in the case of southern galaxies , two 4.5hour observations . in c- and d - configurations we combined sources into a few observations to reduce overhead and to obtain an improved _ uv-_coverage .    during the vla to evla transition time",
    ", the evla - evla baselines showed considerable aliasing and were largely unusable .",
    "since the d - configuration observations had the largest number of evla antennas and therefore evla - evla baselines , we obtained an additional hour of observing time per object to reach our original sensitivity goals .",
    "overall we obtained a total of 3h in d - configuration per galaxy .",
    "the aliasing is a monotonic function that affects the first @xmath43mhz ( or @xmath4 km  s@xmath1  at the  frequency ) , decreasing from the bandpass edge toward the center .",
    "in addition to the make - up time and using mostly baselines with old vla antennas , we placed the  lines away from the affected frequency ranges but could not fully eliminate the effects . as a result ,",
    "the noise levels in our data products are not entirely uniform across all channels and increase toward lower frequencies where aliasing is strongest . across the full width of our most narrow 0.78mhz bandwidths",
    "the noise can vary up to 35% .",
    "for the smaller width of the spectral line feature , the effect is smaller .",
    "in addition , for part of the observations , we tried to place the  signal away from the most affected frequency ranges and for most galaxies the noise level changes could be constrained to an rms variation of @xmath44% over the width of the  line .",
    "for the two galaxies that were observed in the 4if mode , kk77 and ngc247 , the full bandwidths were required to cover the requested velocity ranges .",
    "the aliased signal appears in each if and , consequently , the full noise variations of up to 35% are visible across the combined spectrum . overall , however , this will not have a huge impact on most of the data analysis ; kk77 is a non - detection , and ngc247 is one of our brightest objects such that the signal - to - noise ratio is only moderately affected .",
    "a few galaxies ( marked `` a '' in table[tab : obs ] ) had emission whose velocity range overlapped with galactic  line features .",
    "we addressed this problem by observing the bandpass calibrator at two different frequencies , offset by @xmath45mhz from the source frequency , in order to interpolate the calibration to the source frequency .",
    "in addition to the new observations , in preparing for the program , we identified a few archival vla observations which would be of use to the program .",
    "most archival data , however , were observed at the relatively lower spectral resolution of @xmath46 km  s@xmath1  with online hanning smoothing applied . to avoid interpolation , we kept the lower velocity resolution of the archival data and rebinned our new vla - angst observations after calibration for the final cube .",
    "table[tab : obs ] lists all of our observational setups .",
    "column ( 1 ) lists the galaxy names followed by the array configurations of the observations and the project codes in columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "ao215 is the genuine vla - angst project , while other project codes refer to archival data .",
    "the observing dates are listed in column ( 4 ) .",
    "asterisks denote observations that span across midnight , for which we refer to the start dates .",
    "the equatorial pointing positions are provided in columns ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) and the appropriate equinox is tabulated in column ( 7 ) .",
    "column ( 8) gives the phase calibrators that were used for the observations .",
    "the correlator setups are displayed in columns ( 9 ) through ( 14 ) with ( 9 ) the correlator modes , ( 10 ) the bandwidths , ( 11 ) the number of channels , and ( 12 ) the channel widths in km  s@xmath1  ( for the rest frequency of  at 1.420405752ghz ) .",
    "vla - angst data were taken at the fixed sky frequencies listed in column ( 13 ) whereas many archival observations were doppler tracked at the velocities listed in column ( 14 ) .",
    "finally , column ( 15 ) provides the number of converted evla antennas in the dataset with the remaining antennas being old , not yet converted , vla antennas at the time .",
    "data calibration was performed using the aips package and deviated from the `` standard '' vla data reduction procedure due to the effects from the vla to evla transition period . as mentioned above , evla - evla baselines showed considerable aliasing that affected primarily the narrow bandwidth observations .",
    "our reduction scheme followed the following steps .    to avoid low signal - to - noise solutions during calibration , we started by eliminating edge channels . about 20% of the entire bandwidths were cropped , @xmath47% at the upper and @xmath47% at the lower frequency ends ( task uvcop ) . after correcting the absolute antenna positions ( vlant ) , the absolute flux scale of the primary flux calibrators 3c286 and 3c48 ( see  .[ssec : obssetup ] ) were calculated by the task setjy using nrao - provided models and `` perley - taylor 99 '' flux scales .",
    "we manually inspected all calibrator data in each array configuration for bad visibilities due to rfi or cross - talk between antennas ( aips tasks tvflag , spflg , uvflg , wiper ) . if calibrators showed higher than expected signal on short baselines due to solar interference , we excluded baselines with a _",
    "uv _ range between 0 and 1 k@xmath48 in the calibration .",
    "solar rfi was usually well removed by continuum subtraction in the source visibilities , so we performed no additional source flagging due to solar interference .",
    "the data were then bandpass - corrected by deriving a channel - based , normalized gain solution from the flux calibrator data via bpass .",
    "we produced a new broad band `` channel zero ''",
    "( ch0 ) map from these bandpass corrected data ( avspc ) , and utilized the new ch0 map in all subsequent calibration steps .",
    "next , we calculated the complex antenna gain as a function of time for all calibrators ( calib ) .",
    "the complex gain is a solution for both gain and phase , and for all solutions we assumed that the complex gain calibrators are point - like .",
    "with clcal we linearly interpolated all phase / gain solutions for across all time intervals .",
    "getjy transferred the flux calibration to the complex gain calibrator . at this stage",
    ", we manually inspected the quality of the calibration and repeated the above procedure if rfi corrupted the solution and further flagging was required .",
    "finally , we applied all calibration solutions to the target galaxies .",
    "we estimate the calibration flux uncertainties to be @xmath49% .    for galaxies",
    "whose  emission is within the velocity range of the foreground galactic emission ( marked `` a '' in table[tab : obs ] ) , the flux and bandpass calibrators were observed at offsets of @xmath45mhz relative to the frequency of the targets .",
    "the calibration of these data followed the same steps as above with each observed frequency calibrated separately .",
    "we then obtained an interpolated flux and bandpass solution calibration from a linear interpolation across these offset frequencies .",
    "the evla uses different internal local oscillator settings than the vla . for our observations during the vla to evla transition phase ,",
    "this difference had the unfortunate effect that , for some observations , the 25mhz frontend filter overlapped in frequency with the upper frequency offset bandpass observations .",
    "this resulted in an extreme phase gradient across that particular offset frequency and the affected observations were unusable . in these cases",
    ", we calibrated the source data by extrapolating the calibration from the single offset frequency that most closely matched the bandpass derived from the phase calibrator .",
    "this method provided bandpasses that are accurate to few percent . for observations where",
    "the _ complex gain _ calibrator was contaminated by galactic , we simply flagged the affected channels before calculating a new ch0 to be used for the gain and phase solutions .",
    "after applying all calibration tables to the source , the galaxy data were separated ( split ) from the flux and phase calibrator data for further processing .",
    "both ngc247 and kk77 were observed in the 4if mode .",
    "we calibrated each of the 2if windows separately as described above , and `` stitched '' the data together , averaging overlapping velocity ranges in the process ( ujoin ) prior to continuum subtraction .",
    "to determine the continuum level , we fit a linear function to the line - free channels , typically 20 channels on each side of the spectrum .",
    "the fit was then subtracted from the complex @xmath50-data ( task uvlsf ) .",
    "since the frequencies for each observing set up were fixed ( see  .[ssec : obssetup ] ) , we regridded the  data to a common heliocentric , optical velocity system ( cvel ) .",
    "finally , data from all observations and array configurations were combined ( dbcon ) into a single data set for imaging .",
    "we produced dirty images with imagr and inspected the cubes for artifacts .",
    "if further flagging was required , we went back to the original source data , flagged , and reapplied the calibration .",
    "after satisfactory calibration and source editing , we used the aips task imagr to generate data cubes and final data products .",
    "we followed the things protocol when possible so that the two data sets could be easily compared .",
    "for each vla - angst galaxy , we imaged the visibilities with two different weighting schemes : one using natural weighting and one using the `` robust '' weighting ( originally described by * ? ? ?",
    "* with small modifications as described in the aips help files ) .",
    "natural weighting yields high sensitivity at moderate resolution ( typically @xmath51 for our galaxies , or about @xmath52pc for a distance of 3mpc ) , while robust weighting decreases the size of the synthesized beam at the cost of reduced surface brightness sensitivity .",
    "we applied a robust parameter of 0.5 , which was found to be a good compromise between resolution and sensitivity and matches the maps generated by things .",
    "when compared to the naturally - weighted cubes , the noise in the robust - weighted cubes is typically @xmath53% higher and the beam size @xmath54% smaller . depending on the angular extent of each galaxy s  emission , the cubes were imaged with either 1024@xmath55 pixels at 1.5 per pixel or 2048@xmath55 pixels at 1.0 per pixel .",
    "the cubes were deconvolved using the clark clean deconvolution algorithm @xcite , stopping at a residual flux threshold of 2.5 times the noise level as measured in the cubes . finally , we produced primary beam corrected data cubes that were later used in the moment map analysis (  [ sec : dataproducts ] ) .",
    "the properties of all data cubes are listed in table[tab : dataproperties ] where column ( 1 ) lists the galaxy names followed by columns ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) , and ( 5 ) that contain the weighting algorithms and the resulting beam major and minor axes sizes as well as the position angles of the deconvolved data . the average root mean squared noise per channel is shown in column ( 6 ) and the channel width in ( 7 ) , the number of pixels in each plane in column ( 8) followed by the pixel size in column ( 9 ) .",
    "the most important difference between the vla - angst datacubes and the things datacubes is the higher velocity resolution in the majority of the vla - angst datacubes which was possible because of the overall smaller range in velocity of detectable  in the vla - angst sample of galaxies .",
    "the sensitive and spatial resolution of things and vla - angst are very similar .",
    "the spatial resolution of little things and shield are similar to vla - angst , too , since all surveys share the same vla array configuration setups . given the wider lines of the somwehat more massive galaxies in little things ( see fig.[fig : surveys ] ) , the bandwidth had to be slightly increased for this survey and their velocity resolution hovers around the upper limit of ours at @xmath56 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "on the other hand , little things has about 1/3 longer integration times than vla - angst .",
    "the two westerbork surveys halogas and whisp exhibit 2 to 5 times lower spatial resolution than the vla surveys but their sensitivity limits are comparable , observed at a lower velocity resolution of @xmath57 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "figgs has a velocity resolution of @xmath58 km  s@xmath1  and a beam 2 - 8 times larger than vla - angst .    to ensure that our datacubes would be as directly comparable to the things datacubes as possible , we reduced things observations using our calibration , mapping , and deconvolution protocols .",
    "comparisons of our reductions of things observations with the publicly available things datacubes showed no significant differences .      to suppress noise for the production of moment maps , we generated image cube masks that defined regions containing detectable emission from the galaxies .",
    "to do so , we convolved the natural - weighted images to twice the original beam major axis and applied spectral hanning smoothing with a three channel wide kernel .",
    "new `` mask '' cubes containing predominantly  signal were constructed by keeping all regions corresponding to  emission above the @xmath59 noise level and blanking all other regions . to remove the effects of sidelobes , noise spikes , or other spurious signals from the masks , any individual regions with an area smaller than the beam size were automatically removed .",
    "we then eliminated any remaining non - emission regions by eye inspection .",
    "the result is a single mask cube per galaxy that we applied prior to the generation of the integrated spectra and moment maps .",
    "the same mask is used for both the natural and robust data cubes .",
    "new cubes containing predominantly  signal were constructed by keeping all  emission corresponding to unblanked regions in the mask cube . for our data , this method discriminated well between significant , low level emission and pure noise .",
    "note that this process produces a lower limit to the total  emission .",
    "some very low surface brightness  may be have been eliminated from these data cubes .",
    "note that mask generation is not entirely automatic , and , therefore , our mask generation can not be said to be strictly following things protocols .",
    "this is exacerbated by the differences in typical channel widths , which leads to differences between vla - angst and things in average noise levels in the individual channels .",
    "nonetheless , we have followed the intentions of the things project to use masking to suppress the noise and to provide optimal moment maps .",
    "however , one should be aware that small differences in masks are possible and that the resulting moment maps have a small inherent systematic uncertainty .",
    "recovery of the total  flux from each channel and the resulting  spectra is more complicated than simply summing up the total emission . @xcite have shown that standard clean maps do not in actuality yield correct flux measurements .",
    "maps in aips are created by summing the clean components , convolved with the clean beam , to the signal that is still present in the residuals .",
    "while both maps are purportedly measured in jansky(beam  area)@xmath1 , the relevant beam is different in each map : the convolved clean component map is measured in jy ( clean  beam  area)@xmath1 while the residual map has units of jy(dirty  beam  area)@xmath1 .",
    "because the areas of the clean beam and the dirty beam are different , the flux in the clean components and in the residuals must be corrected to obtain the proper  flux .",
    "a full discussion of the following correction technique is given in @xcite .",
    "the corrected flux of a channel is given by : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the corrected flux , @xmath62 is the flux in the convolved clean components [ with units of jy(clean  beam)@xmath1 ] , @xmath64 is the flux in the residual map [ with units of jy(dirty  beam)@xmath1 ] , and @xmath65 is the correction factor that takes into account the ratio of the dirty beam area to the clean beam area .",
    "imagr provides a method to automatically apply this correction and , following the things protocol , we determined @xmath65 within the inner @xmath66 pixels of the dirty and clean beams .",
    "this produces a set of two new natural and robust weighted cubes with the above correction applied in addition to our standard cubes . when the residuals are scaled by @xmath65 , the noise in the corrected cubes is artificially suppressed .",
    "we thus produced two sets of data cubes for different analyses :    1 .",
    "`` standard '' cube : the standard output from our pipeline , with uncorrected fluxes but uniform noise properties .",
    "no primary beam correction is applied to these data .",
    "this cube should be used for any analysis that requires uniform noise properties or uses selection based on noise ( e.g. , fitting of individual profiles in order to construct velocity fields or measure profile shapes ) .",
    "`` rescaled '' cube : the cube with the flux correction applied , to be used only in regions with genuine  emission .",
    "the flux values in this cube are correct , and therefore any analysis that requires selection based on  fluxes should use this cube ( e.g. , mass and column density measurements ) .",
    "the `` rescaled '' cube is corrected for the attenuation from the primary beam .",
    "the data products that we make available follow this recipe ; all global  spectra (   [ ssec : spectra ] ) and moment maps (   [ sec : dataproducts ] ) were derived using the masked , `` rescaled cubes '' .",
    "the online data cubes themselves are the `` standard '' cubes , without primary beam attenuation or flux corrections .",
    "global  spectra are derived from the masked , rescaled data cubes .",
    "the spectra are used to derive velocity widths at 20% ( @xmath67 ) and 50% ( @xmath68 ) of the peak .",
    "the central velocity of each galaxy is calculated by taking the mid - point of the @xmath67 boundaries .",
    "we also use the integrated  spectra to calculate the total masses of our galaxies using the following equation : @xmath69 =     2.36 \\times 10 ^ 5 \\ ; d^2 \\times \\sum_i s_i \\delta v\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the distance to the galaxy in mpc ( as given in table  [ tab : sample ] ) and @xmath70 is the total flux of a single channel in jykms@xmath1 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this formula assumes that the  emission is optically thin , an assumption that is valid over a large flux range and may begin to fail at very extreme column densities of @xmath71@xmath72 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at our spatial resolution",
    ", we do not observe column densities of this magnitude .    in table[tab :",
    "hiproperties ] , we present all of the derived parameters starting with the galaxy names in column ( 1 ) , followed by the integrated  flux densities @xmath73 and the derived masses in columns ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . for comparison , we compiled single dish fluxes @xmath74 from the literature and list them in column ( 4 ) .",
    "the @xmath67 and @xmath68 values as well as the central velocities are shown in columns ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) , and ( 7 ) , respectively , followed by the peak  column density (  [ ssec : m0maps ] ) taken from the natural - weighted map in the final column ( 8) . to derive upper limits for the non - detections , we assume an  disk the same size as the optical diameter @xmath75 and a hypothetical linewidth of 20 km  s@xmath1",
    ". galaxies typically exhibit dispersions of 5 - 10 km  s@xmath1  and a linewidth of 20 km  s@xmath1  thus implies little rotation or face - on orientation .    in @xmath76% of all cases",
    "the single dish fluxes are somewhat larger than the interferometric vla flux measurements .",
    "this difference is expected to some level given that the vla can only image structures with an extent of up to @xmath77 in d - configuration at 1.4ghz ( limited by the minimum distance between two antennas ) .",
    "missing flux may therefore only be a significant issue for the most extended objects in our sample .",
    "some single dish flux measurements deviate substantially from the trend of being slightly larger than the vla fluxes .",
    "the deviations can be either way : galaxies like ddo6 , ugc4483 , ddo113 , and kk230 have much larger single dish measurements whereas others like bk3n , ao0952 + 69 , sextansb , ddo82 , and ddo190 , have smaller single dish fluxes . such discrepancies may be explained by difficulties in single dish baseline subtraction or by the larger single dish beam that tends to pick up larger fractions of galactic  emission as well as flux from nearby objects .",
    "we used the naturally - weighted data cubes to derive  spectra (  [ ssec : spectra ] ) for our galaxies given their higher surface brightness sensitivity compared to the robust - weighted data .",
    "this approach captures as much low - level , extended emission as is possible with interferometric vla data .",
    "all fluxes are calculated from the rescaled cubes described in @xmath78[ssec : fluxdensities ] and are presented in fig.[fig : spectra ] . in the case of ngc247 ,",
    "velocities around 108 km  s@xmath1 were strongly contaminated with rfi ; to estimate the flux in this channel , we interpolated the emission from the adjacent channels .",
    "since our sample is composed primarily of dwarf galaxies , the galaxy spectra typically show narrow , singly - peaked profiles .",
    "extreme cases like kdg73 and kkh86 exhibit linewidths of @xmath79 km  s@xmath1 , which implies very little velocity dispersion , maybe due to low signal to noise in the line wings . on the other end of the mass spectrum , a few galaxies ( ngc404 ngc3741 , ddo190 , sextansa , ddo181 , ngc3109 , ngc247 ) exhibit hints of the more familiar double - horned profile expected from larger spiral disks .",
    "the maximum linewidth is observed in ngc247 with @xmath80 km  s@xmath1 .",
    "channel maps of the galaxies are presented in figs.[fig : n247 ] through [ fig : kkh98 ] ( natural weighting ) . given the high spectral resolution of our data , there is typically only little flux in each velocity bin .",
    "some galaxies , mainly the more massive ones such as ngc247 or ngc3109 show the classic `` butterfly '' pattern of a spiral galaxy , a tell - tale sign for a flat rotation curve . the bulk of galaxies exhibit rotation despite the fact that the dispersion adds a stochastic component to the velocity structure .",
    "ngc247 also features a  absorption feature along the line of sight to the background quasar nvss j004713 - 205114 at ra(j2000)@xmath81 and dec(j2000)@xmath82 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "some data cubes are contaminated by galactic foreground emission , but only for ngc404 is the galactic  close to the systemic velocity of the source .",
    "other data cubes , such as that for ao0952 + 69 , contain emission from a nearby object .",
    "ao0952 + 69 , in fact , is likely not a real galaxy but might be a feature within a spatially coincident spiral arm that belongs to the massive m81 galaxy .",
    "we used the aips task xmom to generate moment maps from the masked , flux - corrected cubes .",
    "for all calculations we require that each pixel in a moment map is calculated from at least four unmasked channels ; pixels with fewer channels are masked in all moment maps .",

    "we then convert the moment maps to column density with @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the beam major and minor axes in arcseconds and @xmath90 is the value of moment 0 map at each pixel in units of jybeam@xmath1 km  s@xmath1 . in figs.[fig",

    "the maps exhibit resolved  structures comparable to their beam sizes .",
    "some galaxies , like kk230 , or ngc404 have low columns with peak values of a few times @xmath91@xmath72 .",
    "other galaxies like ddo190 , or ugca292 reach columns of a few times @xmath92@xmath72(or @xmath47m@xmath93pc@xmath94 ) , which is a canonical threshold for star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the intensity - weighted velocity fields ( moment 1 ) maps are calculated using @xmath95    for well - behaved disks this equation gives a good indication of the average velocity of gas in a given pixel .",
    "however , bulk motions , outflows , and other non - circular motions can shift the derived velocity to unexpected values .",
    "therefore , profile fitting in order to determine the velocity of the peak of the emission is a more reliable method for finding the average rotational velocity of the gas at a given location in the galaxy .",
    "while the velocity fields of lower mass dwarfs are less ordered than those of their larger disky counterparts , most still show velocity gradients across their disks that are indicative of rotation , which is typical for  in dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "the  intensity - weighted velocity maps are shown in the lower right panels of the second page of for each galaxy in figs.[fig : n247 ] to [ fig : kkh98 ] .",
    "the linewidth of  emission can be characterized by the intensity - weighted second velocity moment as given by :    @xmath96    where @xmath97 indicates the intensity - weighted velocity derived in the first moment map .",
    "while the second moment can be indicative of the turbulence of the ism , it also reflects the influence of large scale gas flows such as expanding shells or tidal material . at lower resolution",
    ", the velocity dispersion can be artificially inflated by beam smearing over the gradient in the velocity field , especially towards the centers of the galaxies , where this gradient is steepest .",
    "overall , the velocity dispersion values fall in a relatively narrow range of 5 - 15 km  s@xmath1 , as seen in the lower right panel on the second page of figs.[fig : n247 ] to [ fig : kkh98 ] ) .",
    "pixels which yield first velocity moments outside the velocity range of the data cube are blanked in all moment maps .",
