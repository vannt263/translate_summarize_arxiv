    "exclusive leptoproduction of vector mesons has been the subject of significant progress in the last 20 years , in particular , in the hard regime where a highly virtual photon exchange allows one to separate a short distance dominated amplitude of a hard subprocess from suitably defined hadronic objects .",
    "experimental knowledge has been gathered in a wide range of center - of - mass energies , from a few gev at jlab to hundreds of gev at the hera collider . following the pioneering nmc @xcite and e665 @xcite experiments , the hera collaborations h1 and zeus measured @xmath0-meson electroproduction @xcite .",
    "compass also measured the same reaction in an intermediate energy range @xcite .",
    "lower energy data have been extracted at hermes @xcite and jlab @xcite .",
    "the h1 and zeus collaborations have recently provided a complete analysis @xcite of spin density matrix elements describing the hard exclusive productions of the @xmath0 and the @xmath5 vector mesons @xmath6 in the process @xmath7 which can be expressed in terms of helicity amplitudes @xmath8 ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 : polarizations of the virtual photon and the vector meson ) .",
    "the zeus collaboration @xcite has provided data for different photon virtualities @xmath11 , i.e. for @xmath12 gev@xmath13 gev @xmath14 gev@xmath15 while the h1 collaboration @xcite has analyzed data in the range @xmath16 gev@xmath17 gev @xmath18 gev@xmath19 where @xmath20 is the center - of - mass energy of the virtual photon - proton system .",
    "the main features of the hera data are as follows : specific @xmath21 scaling , and @xmath22 and @xmath20 dependence of the cross sections ( features distinct from those in soft diffractive reactions ) strongly support the idea that the dominant mechanism of the diffractive process ( [ process ] ) is the scattering of a small transverse - size , @xmath23 , colorless dipole on the proton target .",
    "this justifies the use of perturbative qcd methods for the description of the process ( [ process ] ) .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "three main approaches have been developed .",
    "the first two , a @xmath1-factorization approach and a dipole approach , are applicable at high energy , @xmath24 .",
    "they are both related to a regge inspired @xmath1-factorization scheme @xcite , which basically writes the scattering amplitude in terms of two impact factors one , in our case , for the @xmath25 transition and the other one for the nucleon to nucleon transition , with , at leading order , a two `` reggeized '' gluon exchange in the @xmath22-channel .",
    "the balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) evolution , known at leading order ( llx ) @xcite and next - to - leading ( nllx ) order @xcite , can then be applied to account for a specific large energy qcd resummation .",
    "the dipole approach is based on the formulation of similar ideas , not in @xmath1 but in transverse coordinate space @xcite ; this scheme is especially suitable to account for nonlinear evolution and gluon saturation effects .",
    "the third approach , valid also for @xmath26 , was initiated in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is based on the collinear qcd factorization scheme @xcite ; the amplitude is given as a convolution of quark or gluon generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) in the nucleon , the @xmath0-meson distribution amplitude ( da ) , and a perturbatively calculable hard scattering amplitude .",
    "gpd evolution equations resum the collinear gluon effects .",
    "the das are subject to specific qcd evolution equations @xcite .",
    "though the collinear factorization approach allows us to calculate perturbative corrections to the leading twist longitudinal amplitude ( see @xcite for nlo ) , when dealing with transversely polarized vector mesons , one faces end - point singularity problems .",
    "consequently , this does not allow us to study polarization effects in diffractive @xmath0-meson electroproduction in a model - independent way within the collinear factorization approach .",
    "an improved collinear approximation scheme has been proposed based on sudakov factors @xcite , which allows us to overcome end - point singularity problems , and has been applied to @xmath0-electroproduction @xcite .    in this study , we consider polarization effects for reaction ( [ process ] ) in the high energy region , @xmath27 , working within the @xmath1-factorization approach , where one can represent the forward helicity amplitudes as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is an impact factor describing the virtual photon to @xmath0-meson transition , and @xmath30 is an unintegrated gluon density , which at the born order is simply related to the proton - proton impact factor , as described below . here , @xmath31 is the transverse momentum of the @xmath32channel exchanged gluons .",
    "the impact factor @xmath29 vanishes at @xmath33 which guarantees the convergence of the integral in eq.([kt - fact ] ) on the lower limit .",
    "in fact , @xmath34 at @xmath35 , which allows us to express the longitudinal amplitude in the collinear limit in terms of the usual gluonic parton distribution function , @xmath36 in the case of the transverse amplitude , the situation in the collinear limit is different due to the above - mentioned end - point singularities . at @xmath35 the transverse impact factor @xmath37 and the transverse amplitude",
    "can not be expressed in terms of the gluonic parton distribution function .",
    "nevertheless , both longitudinal and transverse amplitudes can be calculated within the @xmath1-factorization description ( [ kt - fact ] ) . for the transverse amplitude",
    "the end - point singularities are naturally regularized by the transverse momenta of the @xmath32channel gluons @xcite .",
    "moreover , at large photon virtuality providing the hard scale , the @xmath25 impact factors can be calculated in a model - independent way using qcd twist expansion in the region @xmath38 .",
    "such a calculation involves the @xmath0-meson das as nonperturbative inputs .",
    "the principle point here is that the region @xmath38 gives the dominant contribution to the amplitudes in the integral ( [ kt - fact ] ) .",
    "below we introduce an explicit cutoff for transverse momenta of @xmath32channel gluons to clarify this point .",
    "the calculation of the impact factors for @xmath39 , @xmath40 is standard at the twist-2 level @xcite , while @xmath41 was only recently computed @xcite ( for the forward case @xmath42 ) , up to twist-3 , including two- and three - body correlators , which contribute here on an equal footing .    in our study",
    "we use results @xcite for the @xmath43 and @xmath44 impact factors and a phenomenological model @xcite for the proton - proton impact factor .",
    "this model involves a single energy scale parameter @xmath45 , and is equivalent in our calculation to a specific assumption for the @xmath31 dependence shape of the unintegrated gluon distribution @xmath46 .",
    "our approach is close in spirit to the calculations performed in refs .",
    "@xcite within the dipole approach , where amplitudes are related to the light - cone wave functions @xmath47 .",
    "collinear das are integrals of light - cone wave functions in momentum space over the relative transverse momentum conjugated to @xmath48 the light - cone wave functions are complicated objects , and in practice , their dependence on the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath49 and transverse coordinate separation @xmath50 variables , which describe the @xmath51 dipole , should be modeled .",
    "our main point here is that one can assume the dominant physical mechanism for production of both longitudinal and transversely polarized mesons to be the scattering of small transverse - size quark - antiquark and quark - antiquark - gluon colorless states on the target .",
    "this allows one to calculate corresponding helicity amplitudes in a model - independent way , using the natural light - cone qcd language  twist-2 and twist-3 das .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : if ] , we recall some results of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite about the impact factors and distribution amplitudes for the @xmath52 meson , which we need for computing helicity amplitudes . in sec .",
    "[ sec : helicity_ampl ] , we describe first the model for the proton - proton impact factor .",
    "then we compare with hera data the ratios of helicity amplitudes @xmath53 , calculated both in the wandzura - wilczek ( ww ) approximation and with the account of the genuine contribution .",
    "we also compare our predictions for the @xmath54 ratio with the data of hera .",
    "we obtain a good description of these two ratios . for both observables",
    ", we discuss the effect of the energy scale @xmath55 for the proton - proton impact factor , as well as the sensitivity to the infrared region of @xmath22-channel gluon momenta .",
    "in the impact factor representation at the born order , the amplitude of the exclusive process @xmath57 reads @xmath58 as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : impact_fact ] .",
    "note that in this representation , no skewness effect is taken into account .",
    "the @xmath56 impact factor @xmath59 is defined through the discontinuity of the @xmath60 matrix element for @xmath61 as [ impactdisc ] ^^ * ( _ ) ( _ ) = disc _",
    "( s_^^ * g g p_2^ p_2^ ) , where @xmath62 . in eqs.([defimpactrep ] ) and ( [ impactdisc ] ) the momenta @xmath63 and @xmath64 are parametrized via sudakov decompositions in terms of two lightlike vectors @xmath65 and @xmath66 such that @xmath67 , as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the virtuality of the photon , which justifies the use of perturbation theory , and @xmath70 is the mass of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "the impact @xmath71 in eq.([defimpactrep ] ) can not be computed within perturbation theory , and we will use a model described in sec.[subsec : model ] . note that due to qcd gauge invariance , both impact factors should vanish when either one of the transverse momenta of the @xmath32channel exchanged gluon goes to zero , @xmath72 or @xmath73    the computation of the @xmath74 impact factor is performed within collinear factorization of qcd .",
    "the dominant contribution corresponds to the @xmath75 transition ( twist 2 ) , while the other transitions are power suppressed .",
    "the @xmath75 and @xmath76 impact factors were computed a long time ago @xcite , while a consistent treatment of the twist-3 @xmath77 impact factor has been performed only recently in ref .",
    "it is based on the light - cone collinear factorization ( lccf ) beyond the leading twist , applied to the amplitudes @xmath78 , symbolically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : nonfactorized ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     these figures exhibit the non - negligible effect of qcd evolution on das , in particular , for the genuine twist-3 contributions .",
    "in this appendix we describe the method used to evaluate the integrals over @xmath79 in eqs .",
    "( [ deft00_general ] , [ deft01_general ] ) when no infra - red cutoff is imposed .",
    "let ( @xmath82,@xmath83 ) be the orthonormal basis such as @xmath84 , and then @xmath85 . in that case ,",
    "a residue method , as described in ref.@xcite , can be applied for the @xmath86 integration . in this basis , the amplitudes read [ t00_gen_coord ] & & t_00= ^1_0dyy|y_1(y,^2)^_-d k_1^_-d k_2 + & & \\{+-- } and & & t_01= ^1_0dy(y-|y)_1(y,^2)^_-d k_1^_-d k_2 + & & \\{-+- } , where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the components of the transverse polarization of the @xmath89 in the basis ( @xmath82,@xmath83 ) .",

    "we now integrate over the variable @xmath104 using the residue method .",
    "the poles of the integrands are the same .",
