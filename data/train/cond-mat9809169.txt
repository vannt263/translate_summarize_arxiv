    "the holstein model which describes electrons coupled to some local molecular deformations is a simple model to study polaron properties@xcite .",
    "these recent years , accurate numerical investigations of this model on finite size systems have given new insights@xcite closely linked to some current problems in condensed matter physics@xcite .",
    "a polaron corresponds to an electron renormalized by the interactions with the lattice deformations or phonons@xcite . from a historical point of view@xcite the approach to the polaron problem",
    "consists in computing the spectrum of the whole system containing a single electron coupled to some optical phonons .",
    "writing @xmath0 the momentum of the electron and @xmath1 the momentum of the phonons , the problem is to compute the lowest energy of the system for a total momentum @xmath2 , since the total momentum operator commute with the hamiltonian .",
    "this mimimum eigenenergy of the hamiltonian for a given total momentum @xmath3 gives the polaron relation dispersion , as far as we consider only the low lying excitations of the system that is as far as no phonon excitations are involved .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a different approach to the problem and try to decompose the excitations of the system in term of polaron excitations and renormalized phonons excitations . due to the difficulty of the problem ,",
    "we address only the weak coupling limit of the problem and we use mainly second order perturbation theory in the electron phonon coupling . within this framework",
    ", one can block diagonalize the hamiltonian .",
    "then it is possible to label the eigenstates of the hamiltonian in term of renormalized electron and phonons . in other words ,",
    "an eigenstate of the hamiltonian contains one renormalized electron ( a polaron ) of momentum @xmath0 and some renormalized phonons of momentum @xmath1 ; the total momentum of the state being @xmath2 .",
    "the hamiltonian for the holstein model , in wannier representation , is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are electron creation and annihilation operators , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are phonon creation and annihilation operators .",
    "@xmath9 is the hopping integral , @xmath10 is the optical phonon frequency and @xmath11 is the dimensionless coupling constant . in the strong coupling limit , @xmath12 , the hamiltonian is approximatively diagonalized by the lang - firsov transformation@xcite .",
    "the transformed hamiltonian is given by @xmath13 , with @xmath14 .",
    "it is only when the hopping term is zero that the transformed hamiltonian is diagonal . in this case one",
    "obtains some new fermionic operators , which describe small polarons , or localised polarons .",
    "the small polaron creation operator is given by @xmath15 , or @xmath16 , with @xmath17 while the renormalized phonons operators are given by @xmath18 .",
    "the action of this small polaron creation operator on the vacuum is thus to create an electron and a coherent state for the phonons where the annihilation operator takes the expectation value @xmath11 . for non zero values of the hopping integral ,",
    "these small polarons become some quasiparticles more or less well defined depending on the value of the coupling and on the phonon frequency@xcite .",
    "we notice that for @xmath19 , the small polaron correspond to the bare electron , since there is no coupling and thus no renormalization .",
    "we shall use a similar unitary transformation formalism but in we weak coupling limit , @xmath20 , and work in momentum space where the hamiltonian reads @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the number of sites of the lattice , and indices of various operators correspond to bloch momenta . in the next section we consider our approach for a two site system ,",
    "then we will generalize to a general system .",
    "we start our perturbation theory for the two site system . in this case",
    ", the momentum takes two values @xmath23 and the bare electron relation dispersion is given by @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath26 mode of the phonons is coupled to the total number of electron which is one in this problem .",
    "we drop out this mode after performing the shift corresponding to the displaced oscillator@xcite .",
    "the reduced hamiltonian is then given by @xmath27 we have dropped the index @xmath28 for the boson operators .",
    "the basis states are given by @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the vacuum . for @xmath19",
    "the corresponding eigenenergies are given by @xmath31 .",

    "the states @xmath36 are eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath37 , thus using @xmath38 , we obtain @xmath39 .",
    "up to @xmath40 , the @xmath41-matrix of the unitary transformation is given by @xmath42 c_{\\pi}^{\\dagger } c_{0 } \\ ; - \\ ; \\frac{g\\omega_{0}}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\left [ \\frac{b}{2 t + \\omega_{0 } } + \\frac{b^{\\dagger}}{2 t - \\omega_{0 } } \\right ] c_{0}^{\\dagger } c_{\\pi}\\ ] ] we note that if we set @xmath43 in this expression , we obtain the right transformation which diagonalize the reduced hamiltonian @xmath37 .",

    "the total momentum of the state is @xmath52 if @xmath35 is even and @xmath53 if @xmath35 is odd .",
    "then we write the eigenenergies as @xmath54 .",
    "one obtains @xmath55 @xmath56 for @xmath35 phonons or renormalized phonons in the system @xmath57 corresponds to the fermionic ( polaronic ) excitation energy . in the polaron problem ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case @xmath58 , that is we create a polaron from the vacuum , @xmath59 .",
    "we are left with @xmath60 which is the polaron binding energy and @xmath61 which represents the hopping integral of the polaron .",
    "if we take @xmath62 and @xmath63 we obtains @xmath64 and @xmath65 while exact diagonalization@xcite gives @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "we notice the enhancement of the bandwidth for this two site system .    in term of the renormalized operators , the hamiltonian can now be written in a block diagonal form , @xmath68 { \\cal b}^{\\dagger } { \\cal b } p_{k}^{\\dagger } p_{k}\\ ] ] @xmath69 { \\cal b}^{\\dagger } { \\cal b}^{\\dagger } { \\cal b } { \\cal b } p_{k}^{\\dagger } p_{k } \\ ; + \\ ; \\ldots\\ ] ] the original electron phonon interaction which contained off diagonal transitions between subspaces with the same number of particle ( electron or phonon ) has been eliminated : there is no more off diagonal interactions between the polaron and the renormalized phonons .",
    "next , we consider finite size systems for which numerical results have been obtained@xcite",
    ". let @xmath70 be the state with the configuration of phonons @xmath71 such that @xmath72 .",
    "the basis vector are then @xmath73 .",
    "the eigenstates are given by @xmath74 .",
    "now we use the fact that the state @xmath70 contains no electron , so that @xmath75 . using the definition of the polaron operator @xmath45 , we obtain the desired relation , @xmath76 . in other words ,",
    "the operator @xmath77 acting on the state @xmath70 with the configuration @xmath71 of bare phonons , gives the eigenstate @xmath78 which contains one polaron of momentum @xmath0 and the configuration @xmath71 of renormalized phonons . defining @xmath79",
    ", we therefore obtain @xmath80 .",
    "this is the straightforward generalization of the results obtained for the two site system .    using second order perturbation theory",
    "the polaron dispersion is given by @xmath81 this is a well known result obtained by many approaches@xcite .",
    "this dispersion relation corresponds to a state with one polaron of momentum @xmath0 and zero renormalized phonons .",
    "the next excited states correspond , for example , to states with one polaron of momentum @xmath0 and one renormalized phonon of momentum @xmath82 .",

    "our basic asumptions are a ) that the dispersion of the polaron @xmath87 is slightly renormalized from the bare electron dispersion relation @xmath88 and b ) the system is large enough so that the phonon frequencies are slightly renormalized , so that @xmath89 .",
    "the ground state corresponds to the state with a single polaron of momentum @xmath90 , with energy @xmath91 .",
    "the state of momentum @xmath3 with the lowest energy can be either the state with one polaron of momentum @xmath92 and no renormalized phonons or either the state with one polaron of momentum @xmath90 and one renormalized phonon of momentum @xmath93 such that @xmath83 .",
    "the corresponding energies are respectively @xmath94 and @xmath95 . within our asumptions on @xmath87",
    ", there exists a threshold @xmath96 such that @xmath97 . for @xmath98",
    "the lowest energy is @xmath94 and the state contains only one polaron of momentum @xmath92 . for @xmath99",
    "the lowest energy is @xmath95 and the state contains one polaron of zero momentum and one renormalized phonon of momentum @xmath93 .",
    "as far as the others excitations are concerned , their construction is straightforward . if we compare this spectrum with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , where this spectrum was computed , we find a nice agreement in the case of a weak coupling .",
    "the flat part in the spectrum is just the energy @xmath95 .",
    "we further notice that for @xmath98 , these numerical results show that the polaron dispersion @xmath87 is slightly renormalized from the bare electron dispersion @xmath88 .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that for any coupling , one can define a renormalized electron of momentum @xmath0 and some renormalized bosons of momentum @xmath82 , such that the spectrum is made up of these renormalized excitations .",
    "the renormalized operators can be obtained via an unitary transformation .",
    "this was worked out explicitly in the weak coupling limit using perturbation theory .",
    "recent finite size studies support our approach .    in the crossover regime , where level crossings arise in the spectrum of the hamiltonian ,",
    "it is not possible to define the unitary transformation pertubatively and it is not clear how to make some quantitative predictions .",
