    "the wide field cameras ( wfcs ) on board the bepposax satellite have , since launch in april 1996 , detected and localized over thirty gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "the accurate ( within a few arcminutes ) and swift ( within a few hours ) localizations have enabled the first - time detections of multi - wavelength afterglow emission .",
    "the optical spectra of eight such afterglows revealed red - shifted imprints of identifiable spectral features with @xmath1 s ranging between 0.43 ( grb  990712 , galama et al .",
    "1999 ) and 3.42 ( grb  971214 , kulkarni et al .",
    "1998 ) , with one exceptional redshift of @xmath2 if grb  980425 is associated with sn1998bw ( galama et al . 1998 ) .",
    "grb  991014 triggered the gamma - ray burst monitor on bepposax at 1999 , oct .",
    "14.911508 ut ( tassone et al . 1999 ) .",
    "it was simultaneously detected with wfc unit 2 at an off - axis angle of 15@xmath3 in a total field of view of 40@xmath4 .",
    "the detection was of low significance and the satellite attitude configuration was poorly determined so that the error radius of the grb location was relatively large at 6 .",
    "the location was communicated about 9  hrs after the burst . within one day after the burst , a preliminary _ interplanetary network _ ( ipn ) annulus was published ( hurley & feroci 1999 ) which intersects the wfc error region and reduces the size of the error region by 65% .",
    "optical and radio follow - up observations were performed but no afterglow was detected at these wavelengths .",
    "the sensitivity limit in the optical @xmath5-band is @xmath6  mag for observations starting 11.2  hrs after the burst ( thorstensen et al .",
    "1999 ; uglesich , halpern & thorstensen 1999 ) and at radio wavelengths 125  @xmath7jy ( 8.46  ghz ) and 220  @xmath7jy ( 1.4  ghz ) for observations starting 1.68  d after the burst ( taylor , frail & kulkarni 1999 ) .",
    "grb  991014 also triggered the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on the compton gamma - ray observatory ( trigger no .",
    "7803 , giblin , kippen & sahi 1999 ) .",
    "as measured in 50 - 300 kev peak flux at 64  ms resolution , the burst is in the top 32% of the batse bursts . in fluence ( @xmath825  kev )",
    ", it ranks in the top 58% . the t90 duration ( i.e. , the time interval that encompasses 90% of the detected photons above the background starting from when 5% is accumulated )",
    "according to these data is @xmath9  s. the hardness ratio , as determined from the ratio of the fluence in batse channels 3 ( 100 - 300  kev nominal , fluence in erg  @xmath10 ) to that in channel 2 ( 50 - 100  kev ) , is @xmath11 .",
    "grb  991014 is , within the set of wfc - detected bursts , the shortest in @xmath0-rays which was followed up with sensitive x - ray observations ( grb  980326 has approximately the same duration as grb  991014 but was not followed up ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is unlikely that grb  991014 is a member of the class of short grbs that have been recognized for many years ( norris 1984 , hurley 1992 ) , that tend to have harder energy spectra than the long ones ( dezalay et al . 1992 , 1996 ; kouveliotou et al .",
    "1993 ) , and from which so far no afterglow has been detected in any wavelength regime .",
    "giblin et al . ( 1999 ) identify grb  991014 as belonging to the class of long bursts based on the batse - determined duration and spectral hardness .",
    "we present @xmath0-ray and x - ray measurements , both of the burst event and the afterglow of grb  991014 .",
    "our grb and x - ray afterglow measurements were carried out with the following instruments on board bepposax ( boella et al .",
    "the gamma - ray burst monitor ( grbm ; amati et al .",
    "1997 and feroci et al .",
    "1997 ) comprises 4 lateral shields of the phoswich detector system ( pds , frontera et al .",
    "1997 ) and has a bandpass of 40 to 700 kev .",
    "the normal directions of two shields are each co - aligned with the viewing direction of a wfc unit .",
    "the grbm has 4 basic data products per shield for a grb : a time history of the 40 to 700 kev intensity with a variable time resolution of up to 0.48  ms , 1  s time histories in 40 to 700 and @xmath8100 kev , and a 256-channel spectrum accumulated each 128  s ( independently phased from grb trigger times ; 240 of these channels contain scientific data up to 650  kev ) .",
    "the wfc instrument ( jager et al . 1997 ) consists of two identical coded aperture cameras each with a field of view of 40@xmath4 full - width to zero response and an angular resolution of about 5 .",
    "the bandpass is 2 to 28 kev .",
    "the narrow field instruments ( nfi ) consist of the low - energy  0.1 to 10 kev  and the medium - energy  2 to 10 kev concentrator spectrometer ( lecs and mecs respectively , see parmar et al . 1997 and boella et al .",
    "1997a respectively ) , the pds ( 15 to 300 kev ) , and the high - pressure gas scintillation proportional counter ( 4 to 120 kev , manzo et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "grb  991014 was declared a target of opportunity ( too ) for the nfi and a follow - up observation was performed between october 15.4 ( 13  h after the burst ) and october 16.4 ut ( we will refer to this observation as too1 ) .",
    "the exposure time for the mecs was 38.1  ks .",
    "two sources were identified in mecs data that are within the combined wfc / ipn error region ( in  t  zand et al .",
    "neither of them showed clear variability .",
    "therefore , a second observation was carried out ( too2 ) between october 24.8 and 25.9 ut with a mecs exposure time of 48.2  ks .",
    "the x - ray afterglow was identified with the one source that had disappeared in this second observation : sax j0651.0 + 1136 ( in  t  zand et al .",
    "the burst is at a fairly low galactic latitude with @xmath12=(2025,+52 ) .",
    "in figure  [ figgrblc ] , the time profile of the burst is shown in various bandpasses .",
    "the profile is comparatively simple with a single peak at all energies . within 1",
    "s , the peak occurs simultaneous at all energies .",
    "the peak profile appears to flip from below to above 40  kev ( i.e. , it has a fast - rise exponential - decay profile below 40  kev and an exponential - rise fast - decay one above that ) .",
    "the burst lasts longest at the lowest energies . in the 2 - 28 kev band",
    "the t90 duration is @xmath13  s , while in 40 to 700 kev this is @xmath14  s. we generated a spectrum from the 7-s interval when the wfc signal was brightest .",
    "this spectrum can be modeled by a power law function @xmath15 phot  s@xmath16@xmath10kev@xmath16 with photon index @xmath17 assuming an interstellar absorption of @xmath18  @xmath10 ( according to an interpolation of the hi maps by dickey & lockman 1990 ) . the peak flux in 1-s time resolution following this spectrum",
    "is @xmath19  erg  s@xmath16@xmath10 ( 2 - 10 kev ) .",
    "we estimate the 2 - 10 kev fluence at @xmath20  erg  @xmath10 . for 2 to 28 kev",
    "these numbers should be multiplied by 4.1 .",
    "the wfc observation on this field was ongoing for 1.15  d before the occurrence of the grb .",
    "a total of 39.5  ksec net exposure time was accumulated .",
    "the grb was not detected during this time , with a 3@xmath21 flux upper limit of @xmath22  erg  s@xmath16@xmath10 ( 2 - 10 kev , assuming the same spectral shape ) . beyond 8",
    "s after the burst onset , only 972  s of net exposure time were left in the observation .",
    "we could not find any signal from the burst position on time scales of 5  s , 10  s , or 972  s , and in 2 - 10 or 2 - 28 kev .",
    "the 3@xmath21 upper limit for 972  s in 2 - 10 kev is @xmath23  erg  s@xmath16@xmath10 .    in 40 to 700 kev ,",
    "the peak intensity is @xmath24  c  s@xmath16 in a time resolution of 1  s and twice as large , @xmath25  c  s@xmath16 , in a resolution of 62.4  ms .",
    "the 1  s peak flux is @xmath26  erg  s@xmath16@xmath10 and the fluence @xmath27  erg  @xmath10 .",
    "this brings the x - ray to @xmath0-ray fluence ratio to 11% which is relatively high though not exceptional .",
    "a fourier power spectrum of the high time resolution data of the grbm shows no significant features between @xmath28  hz and 64  hz .    beyond 40 kev the burst shows no spectral evolution , although the statistical quality does not permit a sensitive analysis .",
    "the photon index as derived from a power law fit to the two - channel 1  s grbm data shows no evolution with @xmath29 ranging from @xmath30 to @xmath31 over the three brightest time bins , but the longer duration in the wfc band with respect to the grbm band suggest an overall hard - to - soft evolution .",
    "the difference in @xmath29 between the grbm and wfc data suggests a break in the spectrum between the wfc and grbm bands .",
    "the statistical quality of the 256-channel grbm data of grb  991014 does not permit a sensitive spectral analysis .",
    "the receipt of final ulysses ephemeris and timing data , and of the final bepposax ephemeris data , has allowed us to reduce the width of the ulysses / grbm ipn annulus from 33 ( hurley & feroci 1999 ) to 15 ( 3 sigma ) .",
    "the final annulus , fully contained within the old one , is shown in figure  [ fignfimap ] .",
    "the initial error box , formed by the intersection of the preliminary ipn annulus with the wfc error circle , had an area of 36 square arcminutes .",
    "the final error box , formed by the intersection of the refined ipn annulus with the final nfi error circle , has an area of approximately 4 square arcminutes .",
    "the x - ray field around grb  991014 is somewhat complicated .",
    "several faint x - ray sources can be recognized in a circular field of diameter 25  around the wfc position .",
    "because of this complication , we carried out a maximum - likelihood analysis of the mecs imaging data . in comparison to the standard analysis methods ,",
    "the maximum - likelihood method is able to fully take into account the point spread function ( psf ) which 1 ) is critical in disentangling sources that are so close to each other that their psfs overlap considerably , 2 ) ensures that all photons detected from each point source are retrieved , and 3 ) takes into account the poissonian nature of the data .",
    "the maximum - likelihood analysis was performed in two steps . in the first step",
    "a map was generated of detection significance , and in the second step the flux and position of all point sources were extracted .",
    "for details we refer to the appendix .",
    "the significance map for too1 data is given in figure  [ fignfimap ] .",
    "for the combined mecs too1 and too2 imaging data , four point sources are required to satisfactorily describe the data .",
    "their positions are indicated in figure  [ fignfimap ] .",
    "the elongated structure within the initially reported as well as refined ipn / wfc error box is explained by two point sources separated by 15 .",
    "we designate the upper ( most northern ) source as s1 and the lower one as s2 .",
    "the photon count numbers were determined in various time intervals by maximum - likelihood fits of the 4 point source strengths  while keeping the positions fixed  and the background level .",
    "the average mecs ( units 2 and 3 added ) photon count rate during too1 is @xmath32  c  s@xmath16 for s1 and @xmath33  c  s@xmath16 for s2 .",
    "we divided too1 in 3 time intervals to search for variability of the two sources , without a definite result ( the maximum difference in photon count rate is for s1 , but only at 1.4@xmath21 ) .",
    "in too2 the average rates are @xmath34  c  s@xmath16 for s1 ( 3@xmath21 upper limit ) and @xmath35  c  s@xmath16 for s2 . from these latter numbers we identify s1 as the afterglow source of grb  991014 .",
    "s1 is equal to sax  j0651.0 + 1136 .",
    "its position is @xmath36=6@xmath3751@xmath3802.9@xmath39 , @xmath40=+11@xmath33603 .",
    "the statistical error radius is 40  ( 99% confidence ) but the systematic error enlarges the final error radius to 15 .",
    "the combined ipn / nfi error box is depicted in figure  [ fignfimap ] .",
    "the ratio of the upper limit in too2 and the average flux in too1 implies that the decay index is steeper than @xmath41 .",
    "a spectrum was generated for the afterglow from the lecs and mecs too1 data by maximum - likelihood fits of the 4 point source strengths and background level in four logarithmically - sized bands between 0.2 and 2.2 kev for the lecs data and eight logarithmically - sized bands between 1.6 and 10  kev for the mecs data ( 2 units ) . a simple absorbed power law model with galactic interstellar absorption of @xmath18  @xmath10 ( following dickey & lockman 1990 ) fits the data well ( @xmath42 for 6 dof ) with a photon index of @xmath43 .",
    "the average ( unabsorbed ) flux is @xmath44  erg  s@xmath16@xmath10 ( 2 - 10 kev ) which is a factor of 10@xmath45 smaller than the 2 - 10 kev peak flux of the gamma - ray burst itself .",
    "this implies that the energy emitted in the x - ray afterglow is comparable to that in the burst itself , and a decay index between the wfc and the mecs fluxes of @xmath46 which is not extraordinary quick when compared to other cases ( e.g. , piro 2000 ) .",
    "the data provide a constraint on @xmath47 : it is less than @xmath48  @xmath10 .",
    "no signal was seen in the pds data of too1 . the 2@xmath21 upper limit in 15 - 100",
    "kev is 30 times the flux predicted by an extrapolation of the mecs - measured spectrum .",
    "the nfi field seems complicated , with a concentration of sources near the grb position .",
    "actually this number of sources is not a surprise given the number of background sources expected .",
    "giommi , fiore & perri ( 1999 ) have estimated log@xmath49-log@xmath50 distributions for 2 - 10 kev background sources in bepposax observations at high galactic latitudes and find that for a flux limit of @xmath51  erg  s@xmath16@xmath10 ( 2 - 10 kev ) there are approximately 10 sources per square degree .",
    "the chance probability to find 3 or more sources in a 25-diameter circle is 18% .",
    "the galactic latitude is fairly low for grb  991014 .",
    "therefore , one may actually expect more sources than those already counted at high galactic latitude , particularly above 2 kev given @xmath18  @xmath10 .",
    "the concentration towards the grb may be a selection effect because the sensitivity of the mecs increases towards the center position due to vignetting of the concentrators .",
    "the constraints that could be derived for the indices of the spectrum and temporal decay are not unusual as compared to the x - ray afterglows of other grbs ( for a review of x - ray afterglows , see for example piro 2000 ) .",
    "also , the spectrum of the prompt emission is not unusual .",
    "the upper limit on the optical afterglow is fairly faint .",
    "this is not the result of galactic extinction which in this direction is a mild @xmath52 , based on hi maps by dickey & lockman ( 1990 )",
    ". it may be the result of extinction in a host galaxy .",
    "we remark that it is not exceptional that no optical afterglow was detected .",
    "this applies to about half of all well - localized grbs ( e.g. , kulkarni et al . 2000 ) .",
    "we conclude that grb  991014 does not exhibit behavior in the prompt spectrum or the afterglow that would make it distinct from other _",
    "longer _ bursts .",
    "we are grateful to the staff of the bepposax scientific operation center , the mission planning team and the science data center for their support in obtaining and processing the data .",
    "we thank tim giblin for useful discussions .",
    "kh is grateful for ulysses support under jpl contract 958056 , and to the bepposax guest investigator program and nasa grant nag5 - 9126 for ipn support .",
