    "the spin hall effect ( she ) @xcite refers to the spin accumulation with opposite polarizations at the two edges of a hall bar , due to the transverse spin current induced by a driving longitudinal charge current .",
    "this effect was first theoretically proposed @xcite as arising from the spin - dependent scattering at impurities with spin - orbit interaction . in the literature",
    "this is commonly referred to as the `` extrinsic she '' as it relies on the presence of impurities ( `` extrinsic mechanism '' ) . in this case , the asymmetric mott - skew and side jump scattering contributions drive spin up and down electrons toward opposite directions , thus giving rise to a net transverse spin current ( with no charge current ) and to spin accumulation at the edges .",
    "recently , two theoretical works@xcite predicted that the spin - orbit effects on the band structure of semiconductors ",
    "the so called `` intrinsic mechanism '' for the she  can also give rise to a spin current perpendicular to an applied electric field , even in the absence of impurities .",
    "these authors have calculated the ballistic spin hall conductivity ( shc ) @xmath0 , defined via @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the @xmath6 component of the velocity operator and @xmath7 are the pauli matrices , for a p - doped three - dimensional ( bulk ) valence band system @xcite and for a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) with the rashba spin orbit interaction.@xcite    a number of theoretical papers have investigated the robustness of the ballistic shc @xmath0 as arising from the intrinsic mechanism , against scattering by non - magnetic@xcite and magnetic@xcite impurities , its dependence on specific classes of so interactions,@xcite and the interplay between the so coupling and magnetic fields.@xcite two early experimental efforts @xcite have probed the spin hall effect for electrons and holes.@xcite kato _ _ et al.__@xcite find that the she in n - gaas epilayers is due to the extrinsic mechanism ( non - magnetic impurities ) , while wunderlich _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite conclude that the she in the 2d hole gas probed in their experiment is intrinsic .",
    "further investigations have also shown that the she in 2degs is of the extrinsic type.@xcite    following an early debate concerning the robustness of the intrinsic she , it is now well established that the dc shc as defined above vanishes identically for model hamiltonians with a linear - in - the - carrier - momentum so interaction , such as that of rashba and/or the linearized dresselhaus .",
    "this holds in both the ballistic case@xcite ( `` clean limit '' ) and in the limit of weak scattering by non - magnetic impurities.@xcite this result can be understood by examining the relationship between the time derivative of the spin density and spin current in these systems . as pointed out in refs .",
    "[ ] , [ ] , and [ ] , for rashba - type models @xmath8 , @xmath9 and should vanish in the dc steady state regime ( in the presence of some relaxation mechanism ) where @xmath10.@xcite    the search for new materials that can exhibit the she as well as other types of so interactions has continued over the years.@xcite recently , we have introduced a new type of so interaction present in iii - v ( or ii - vi ) zinc - blende semiconductor quantum wells with more than one subband.@xcite this intersubband - induced so term is similar in form to the rashba so interaction .",
    "however , it couples electron states from distinct subbands and hence can be non - zero even in structurally symmetric wells . for an electron in a symmetric quantum",
    "well with two subbands we have@xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the effective mass , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , with @xmath15 and @xmath16 denoting the band edges of the lowest ( even ) and first excited ( odd ) subbands . @xmath17 and @xmath7 are pauli matrices describing the subband degree of freedom and the electron spin , respectively .",
    "the intersubband - induced so coupling @xmath18 depends on the structural potential of the well , the electronic hartree potential , and the external gate potential.@xcite    in this paper we calculate the dc spin hall conductivity @xmath0 for 2d electrons in the presence of the intersubband - induced so interaction in wells with two subbands .",
    "we use the kubo formula in the ballistic limit .",
    "we follow rashba s approach@xcite by performing our calculation in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath1 , which modifies the energy spectrum ( landau levels ) thus allowing us to consistently include intra- and inter - branch transitions in the kubo formula , and then taking the @xmath19 limit . with this procedure ,",
    "known to produce the correct vanishing of @xmath0 for the rashba model,@xcite we derive an analytical expression for the dc shc in two subband systems .",
    "more specifically , we find that : ( i ) @xmath0 is non - zero for electrons whose fermi energy @xmath20 lies between the subband edges @xmath21 and @xmath22 , i.e. , when only the lowest subband is occupied , and ( ii ) @xmath0 is null for @xmath23 , i.e. , when two subbands are occupied .",
    "interestingly , the non - zero shc is non - universal ( e.g. , it depends on @xmath18 ) , exhibits a non - monotonic behavior and a sign change for @xmath24 .",
    "in addition , the shc presents finite jumps at the subband edges when plotted as a function of @xmath20 ( or the carrier areal density @xmath3 ) , due to discontinuities in the density of states contributing to the spin density .",
    "we have also performed a detailed self - consistent calculation of the energy spectrum and wave functions for realistic wells , from which we determine @xmath18 and the corresponding @xmath0 .",
    "the magnitude of our self - consistently determined shc is , however , much smaller than @xmath25.@xcite    before describing in detail our linear response calculation for the shc , here we present a simple argument as to why we could expect a non - vanishing shc for electrons in 2degs with two subbands where the intersubband so interaction is operative .",
    "despite the formal similarity between the so term in our hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) and that of rashba , here we find a different relationship between the spin current and spin density , i.e. , @xmath26 in contrast to the rashba model for which @xmath27 . in eq .",

    "2degs formed in two subband wells with intersubband so coupling may have a non - zero shc .",

    "the schrdinger equation gives rise to the landau levels @xmath43 with the level index @xmath44 for each subband @xmath45 and spin @xmath46 .",
    "the landau levels are evenly spaced by the cyclotron gap @xmath47 .",

    "it is convenient to introduce dimensionless parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 for the so coupling energy and the subband gap , respectively . in term of these",
    "we can define @xmath61 and @xmath62 with @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "note that the eigenstate for @xmath65 exists only for @xmath66 .",
    "we determine the dc spin hall conductivity at zero temperature by using the kubo formula @xcite @xmath67 where the primed sum indicates that it should be performed over the states with @xmath68 and @xmath69 . here",
    "we have used the fact that the operators @xmath70 and @xmath71 couple only states in same subspace and the matrices @xmath72 and @xmath73 are symmetric and antisymmetric , respectively . since the matrix elements are independent of the guiding center position , the factor @xmath48 appears due to the landau level degeneracy .",
    "a more insightful analysis of the shc can be achieved by expressing the operators in terms of commutators with the hamiltonian .",

    "( [ eq : shc1 ] ) reveals that @xmath91 vanishes identically for arbitrary @xmath1 and @xmath20 .",
    "interestingly , the interbranch and intrabranch contributions exactly cancel out , i.e. , @xmath98 .",

    "it is worth noting that @xmath107 ( or @xmath108 ) varies continuously as @xmath20 passes through the upper subband energy edge @xmath22 , even though the intrabranch transitions coming from the @xmath83 spin branch [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : trans](b ) ] stop contributing at this energy .",
    "this is so because the contribution @xmath109 in eq .",

    "explicitly , the interbranch and intrabranch contributions to @xmath111 are    [ eq : shc2_fb ] @xmath115    the intrabranch contribution from the @xmath83 spin branch , i.e. , the second term in eq .",

    "our self consistent calculation follows that of ref .",
    "[ ] .    in an earlier work,@xcite we have found that narrow single insb wells give sizable values for the intersubband - induced so coupling strength @xmath18 .",
    "here we self consistently calculate the corresponding spin hall conductivity as a function of the areal density @xmath3.@xcite figure  [ fig : shc2 ] shows the calculated interbranch ( @xmath132 ) and intrabranch ( @xmath133 ) conductivity contributions and the total spin hall conductivity @xmath0 [ see eq .",

    "note the two discontinuities of the shc at densities corresponding to @xmath119 ( see vertical dashed line ) and @xmath135 ( at @xmath136 ) .",
    "the magnitude of these jumps are @xmath137 and @xmath138 , respectively .",
    "these discontinuities come from the intrabranch contribution @xmath139 , while the interbranch contribution @xmath140 varies smoothly with @xmath20 ( recall that @xmath141 ) .",
    "in addition , the competition between @xmath142 and @xmath143 can lead to a sign change of @xmath0 as @xmath20 is varied , see fig .",
    "[ fig : shc2 ] .",
    "it should be noted that as the strength of the so coupling @xmath18 ( or @xmath144 ) becomes smaller , @xmath145 and @xmath0 diminish as well , thus vanishing completely at @xmath146 .    despite the interesting features displayed by the total spin hall conductivity  the sign change and the non - monotonic behavior ",
    "as the electron density is varied between the subband edges , we find that the largest values of @xmath147 are extremely small ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "considering the formal similarity between our hamiltonian containing the intersubband - induced so coupling and rashba s , it is not entirely surprising that the shc vanishes when both spin branches are filled .",
    "novel effects of the intersubband - induced so term arise when only the lower branch is filled : an incomplete cancelation between the contributions from the interbranch and intrabranch transitions lead to a nonzero shc and discontinuities in it .",
    "the origin of these discontinuities can be traced back to the abrupt changes in @xmath2 density of states ( dos ) of the model at the subband edges .",
    "the @xmath2 dos for each spin branch is given by @xmath149 with @xmath150 .",
    "hence the dos abruptly changes at @xmath151 from a constant value @xmath152 to @xmath153 , thus giving rise to an abrupt loss of states contributing to the spin density response .",
    "in fact , the intrabranch contribution that is responsible for the discontinuity is proportional to the dos , that is , @xmath154 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : shc2 ] ) ] .",
    "the discontinuity @xmath145 in @xmath155 can be explicitly related to the discontinuity @xmath156 in the dos as follows @xmath157 note that both expressions vanish as @xmath158 , clearly showing that @xmath145 arises from the discontinuity in the dos .",
    "our intersubband - induced so coupling mixes both the spin and the subband degrees of freedom simultaneously .",
    "therefore it does not provide a mechanism to couple _ opposite _ spins within a given subband .",
    "this implies that any projection of our hamiltonian into the lower subband , in the limit of large subband gap @xmath159 , would not produce an effective so coupling between spins within the lower subband so that no finite shc appears .",
    "this limiting case study stresses that our finite shc , even for fermi energies near the lower subband bottom , is due to the subband - transfer process , even though it should be quite small in the limit @xmath159 .",
    "we expect , however , that additional subband - mixing but spin - preserving scattering mechanisms , such as impurity scattering , can induce an effective so coupling within a given subband when mediated by the intersubband - induced so coupling , which mixes both spins and subbands .",
    "this impurity - mediated so coupling may then affect and possibly even enhance the strength of the shc , as long as its momentum randomization is weak enough .    as a final point we mention",
    "that interbranch contribution @xmath160 reproduces the result for the shc calculated via the kubo formula in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "note that this quantity is non universal and vanishes as @xmath161 .",
    "nevertheless , we stress that it alone does not constitute the total shc .",
    "we have calculated the ballistic spin hall conductivity @xmath0 for symmetric wells with two subbands in which the intersubband - induced so interaction is present .",
    "we follow a linear response approach due to rashba which consistently accounts for intrabranch and interbranch transitions in the kubo formula .",
    "we find that @xmath0 is zero when the two subbands are occupied ( similar to the rashba model ) and non - zero when only the lower subband is occupied .",
    "we have also performed a numerical self consistent calculation to determine the intersubband so strength for realistic insb wells and have calculated the corresponding @xmath0 .",
    "even though the calculated @xmath0 shows interesting features such as discontinuities at the subband edges ( due to discontinuities in the dos ) , a non - monotonic behavior and a sign change as a function of the fermi energy ( or areal density ) , the magnitude of @xmath0 is much smaller than 1 in units of @xmath162 .",
    "it is conceivable that other materials systems , e.g. metallic surfaces and interfaces , can display intersubband induced so interaction , in addition to the usual rashba .",
    "for instance , metallic surfaces with unconventional spin topology@xcite where deviations from the usual rashba model have recently been reported ( and for which the so couplings are much stronger than in semiconductors ) are a possibility .",
    "perhaps in these systems the shc due to the intersubband so coupling would be sizable .",
    "one caveat of our calculation is that we use a spin current definition which is a simple extension for two subbands of the conventional ( not - uniquely defined @xcite ) symmetrized product of the spin and velocity operators as in rashba model . hence all the issues related to the reality of these currents and whether or not they would lead to spin accumulation in finite samples appear here as well .",
    "more work is certainly needed to address these issues .",
    "@xcite using non - equilibrium green functions on a lattice , we have performed some simulations@xcite of the spin density in bilayer systems with inter - layer so orbit coupling , whose hamiltonian maps onto our two - subband one .",
    "our preliminary results show that the spin density changes as compared to the single layer case ( rashba model ) . finally , we emphasize that the role of impurities , which we believe should not kill the effect discussed here , remains an interesting problem for further investigations .        for reviews ,",
