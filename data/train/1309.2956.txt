    "the realization of bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) , achieved by taking dilute alkali gases to ultra low temperatures @xcite is certainly among the most exciting recent experimental achievements in physics .",
    "since then , investigations dedicated to the comprehension of new phenomena associated to this state of matter as well as its properties have flourished , either in the experimental or theoretical domains .",
    "one noticeable recent effort is the one that proposes the study of a two - well model with two levels at each well as a mean to study einstein - podolsky - rosen entanglement @xcite .",
    "this quest encouraged the search for new solvable models that could be related to the properties of such condensates , including the possibility of interaction among condensates @xcite .",
    "the motivation that underlies those proposed models is that , by the study of exactly solvable models , quantum fluctuations may be fully taken into account providing tools that allows one to go beyond the results obtained by mean field approximations .",
    "we believe that this fruitful approach may furnish some new insights in this area , and contribute as well to the increasingly interesting field of integrable systems itself @xcite . in the present paper , we will use the algebraic bethe ansatz method to obtain a new multilevel two - well model .",
    "each well is linked to a bec and tunneling between the levels of each well is allowed .",
    "the algebraic formulation of the bethe ansatz , and the associated quantum inverse scattering method ( qism ) , was primarily developed in@xcite .",
    "the qism has been used to unveil properties of a considerable number of solvable systems , such as , one - dimensional spin chains , quantum field theory of one - dimensional interacting bosons @xcite and fermions @xcite , two - dimensional lattice models @xcite , systems of strongly correlated electrons @xcite , conformal field theory @xcite , integrable systems in high energy physics @xcite and quantum algebras ( deformations of universal enveloping algebras of lie algebras ) @xcite . for",
    "a pedagogical and historical review see @xcite .",
    "more recently solvable models have also showed up in relation to string theories ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "remarkably it is important to mention that exactly solvable models are recently finding their way into the lab , mainly in the context of ultracold atoms @xcite but also in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiments@xcite turning its study as well as the derivation of new models an even more fascinating field .",
    "our point of view here comes from very recent results concerning the construction of lax operators , by which it is possible to obtain solvable models suitable for the effective description of the interconversion interactions occurring in the bec . acquiring our motivation from these ideas we present the construction of a two - well solvable model that contemplates interconversion among the levels in each well .",
    "we obtain this model by a multistate lax operator whose construction is fully explained in the sequel .",
    "it is motivated by the construction in @xcite , where a lax operator is defined for a single canonical boson operator , but instead of a single operator we choose a linear combination of independent canonical boson operators .",
    "it is convenient to underline that although in the sequel we follow a formal presentation we do arrive at new integrable physical hamiltonians that share many of the aspects of the physical systems studied through interferometric techniques , such as in @xcite .",
    "in particular , as our models are solvable , one can obtain precise results , for instance , of properties related to the energy gap , entanglement and ground state fidelity @xcite .",
    "also , as mentioned above , increasingly sophisticated nmr techniques @xcite allows manipulation of qubits and we believe that with our models we add an interesting possibility to the usual nmr nuclear quadrupole hamiltonian .",
    "in this section we will shortly review the algebraic bethe ansatz method and present the transfer matrix used to get the solution of the models @xcite .",
    "we begin with the @xmath1-invariant @xmath2-matrix , depending on the spectral parameter @xmath3 ,    @xmath4    with @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 . above",
    ", @xmath8 is an arbitrary parameter , to be chosen later .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath9 satisfies the yang - baxter equation    @xmath10    where @xmath11 denotes the matrix acting non - trivially on the @xmath12-th and the @xmath13-th spaces and as the identity on the remaining space .",
    "next we define the monodromy matrix @xmath14 ,    @xmath15    such that the yang - baxter algebra is satisfied    @xmath16    in what follows we will choose a realization for the monodromy matrix @xmath17 to obtain solutions of a family of models for multilevel two - well bose - einstein condensates . in this construction , the lax operators @xmath18 have to satisfy the relation    @xmath19    then , defining the transfer matrix , as usual , through    @xmath20    it follows from ( [ rtt ] ) that the transfer matrix commutes for different values of the spectral parameter ; i. e. ,    @xmath21=0 , \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\ ; \\forall \\;u,\\;v.\\ ] ]    consequently , the models derived from this transfer matrix will be integrable .",
    "another consequence is that the coefficients @xmath22 in the transfer matrix @xmath23 ,    @xmath24    are conserved quantities or simply @xmath25-numbers , with    @xmath26 = 0 , \\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\",

    "we will consider only two sites , each one supposed to be a well containing a bose - einstein condensate .",
