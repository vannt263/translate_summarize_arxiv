    "during the last few decades cold atoms systems ( @xcite , @xcite ) have been extensively used in many field of research and have played a key role in particular in the understanding of quantum many - body systems .",
    "all these results are related to the impressive progress that has been made in manipulating these many - body systems . nowadays using lasers it is possible to cool atoms down at very low temperature and to achieve regimes at which only fluctuations due to principles of quantum mechanics are relevant to study the many - body system behaviour .",
    "in addition using lasers it is possible to tune two - body interactions ( @xcite ) and moreover it is possible to realize spatially periodic potentials in which cooled neutral atoms congregate in structures resembling usual crystal lattices .",
    "these structures are called _ optical lattices_.",
    "the main difference between optical and ordinary lattices is that all the lattice features are not fixed , but only depend on the experimental setup : tuning laser wavelength and intensity and modifying the number of counter - propagating beams respectively , one can change the interatomic distance ( _ lattice spacing _ ) , the interaction strength ( _ lattice depth _ ) and also the _ lattice geometry _",
    "( @xcite).an important feature of all the experiments with cold atoms on optical lattices is the presence of an external space - dependent confining potential .",
    "such a kind of potential is usually harmonically - shaped ( @xcite , @xcite ) and it directly couples with the particle density of the lattice system , leading to inhomogeneities which give rise to a wide variety interesting physical phenomena ( for example the cohexistence of many quantum - phases @xcite , the presence of an inhomogeneous _ crossover _ @xcite , etc).in this paper we focus our interest on the particular case in which the confining potential can be treated as weak perturbation to the many - body properties of a system of spin-1/2 particles on a @xmath1-dimensional lattice , which is described by using the well - known hubbard model .",
    "we consider this model at fixed number of particles @xmath9 and zero temperature @xmath10 . in this particular regime",
    "we show that it is possible to map exactly the lattice theory to a continuous one which depends on the dimensionality @xmath1 of the starting model .",
    "+ in the framework of ultracold atom experiments , our study is useful to describe the inhomogeneity effects induced by a weak space - dependent confinement on a system of ultracold alkali atoms ( for example @xmath11 ) loaded into an optical lattice , in which the two lowest hyperfine levels of each atom , interacting via feshbach resonance , are treated as the two spin polarizations ( namely @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) of a spin-1/2 particle.the paper is organized as follows . in section ( [ sec : hamiltonian model ] ) we discuss the main features of the hubbard model and how it is possible to keep into account the effects introduced by an external confining potential within the formalism of the so called trap - size scaling . in section ( [ sec : regularization ] ) we show how to map the @xmath1-dimensional lattice theory into a continuous @xmath1-dimensional theory and here we discuss the main properties of this continuum limit . in section ( [ sec : correspondencehypothesis ] ) we show how the continuum limit can be used to analyse the lattice problem ( _ the correspondence hypothesis _ ) . + in section ( [ sec : oned ] ) we solve the two - body unpolarized problem ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) associated to continuous theory derived in section ( [ sec : regularization ] ) in @xmath2 , which is the gaudin - yang model in the presence of an external confining potential .",
    "in addition in this section we show that the one - body density function associated to the ground - state wave - function of this problem describes exactly the asymptotic trap - size scaling behaviour of the particle density of the one - dimensional lattice system in the same conditions . in section ( [ sec : crossover ] ) we discuss the results of section ( [ sec : oned ] ) in terms of the existence of a _ statistical crossover _ driven by the two - body interaction : passing from the _ infinitely repulsive _ regime to the _ infinitely attractive _ regime , results show that the system experiment a smooth crossover from a gas of _ spinless fermions _ to a gas of _ hard - core bosons_. + in section ( [ sec : twod ] ) we consider and solve the two - body unpolarized problem in @xmath3 . as in section (",

    "<S> we investigate the ground - state ( gs ) density properties of a system of spin-@xmath0 particles described by the @xmath1-dimensional hubbard model in the presence of an harmonic trap . </S>",
    "<S> in particular we consider this system at zero temperature in the so called dilute regime ( fixed number of particles and weak confinement ) . in this regime </S>",
    "<S> the trap - size ( ts ) dependence of the gs density can be described using the ts - scaling method . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that the asymptotic ts - scaling behaviour of the particle density of the lattice model can be put in exact correspondence with the one - body density function associated to the gs of a continuous theory that is the continuum limit of the trapped hubbard model . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of this correspondence has been tested explicitly in @xmath2 and @xmath3 comparing the numerical results obtained for lattice particle density with the one - body density of the gs wave - function of the continuum limit in the case of two - particle and in absence of spin - polarization ( @xmath4,@xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular in @xmath2 results support the existence of a statistical crossover driven by the two - body interaction strength @xmath6 from a gas of hard - core bosons ( @xmath7 ) to a gas of spinless fermions ( @xmath8 ) . </S>"
