    "hlder continuity is ubiquitous in dynamical systems .",
    "hlder continuous differential ( though not differentiable ) forms consequently play an important role there , especially in hyperbolic and partially hyperbolic dynamics .",
    "for instance , integrability of various invariant distributions ( by which we mean bundles or plane fields ) and the holonomy of the corresponding foliations can be expressed in terms of differential forms .",
    "anosov used differential forms extensively for this purpose in his seminal paper @xcite .",
    "assume , for example , that @xmath0 is a hlder continuous invariant splitting for a diffeomorphism @xmath1 .",
    "it is often important to know whether @xmath2 is an integrable distribution .",
    "one can locally define @xmath3 independent hlder 1-forms @xmath4 such that the intersection of their kernels equals @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath5 admits a global frame , these forms can be defined globally .",
    "let @xmath6 .",
    "then @xmath7 , for every vector @xmath8 tangent to @xmath2 ( where @xmath9 denotes the inner multiplication by @xmath8 ) , so we can write @xmath10 .",
    "the frobenius integrability condition ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) requires that @xmath11 be divisible by @xmath12 , i.e. , that @xmath13 , for some 1-form @xmath14 .",
    "recall that this is equivalent to @xmath15 , for all @xmath16 . since @xmath12 is only hlder",
    ", this condition clearly does not apply .",
    "hartman  @xcite ( see also plante  @xcite ) proved an analogous integrability condition for continuous forms using the notion of the stokes differential .",
    "namely , @xmath12 is said to be stokes differentiable if there exists a locally integrable @xmath17-form @xmath18 such that @xmath19 for every smoothly immersed @xmath17-disk with piecewise smooth boundary @xmath20 .",
    "the form @xmath18 is then called the stokes differential of @xmath12 .",
    "hartman showed that @xmath2 is integrable if and only if @xmath12 divides @xmath18 in the above sense .",
    "the utility of this result is limited since there are no good criteria for the stokes differentiability of continuous hlder forms .    in certain dynamical situations , however , in order to show integrability of an invariant distribution one needs less than the stokes or frobenius theorem , as we will demonstrated in this paper .",
    "the crucial inequality is given in theorem a : for any compact manifold @xmath21 , there exist numbers @xmath22 depending on @xmath21 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , such that for every @xmath25 hlder @xmath23-form ( @xmath26 ) @xmath12 on @xmath21 and every @xmath27 immersed disk @xmath28 with piecewise @xmath27 boundary satisfying @xmath29 , @xmath30 the idea behind the proof is simple : we approximate @xmath12 locally by smooth forms @xmath31 , such that @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a universal constant .",
    "this is done by using the standard technique of regularization . by subtracting and adding @xmath31 from and to @xmath12 in @xmath35",
    ", it is easy to show that @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a constant depending only on @xmath38 .",
    "the trick is to allow @xmath39 to vary over a sufficiently large interval and then find the best @xmath39 by minimizing the right - hand side of .",
    "for this , @xmath40 needs to be sufficiently small . to eliminate the smallness requirement on @xmath40",
    ", we use a special case of the isoperimetric inequality on riemannian manifolds , supplied by gromov  @xcite .",
    "we give two applications of this inequality in dynamical systems .",
    "first , we prove a criterion for the existence of a global cross section to an anosov flow in terms of its expansion and contraction rates ( theorem b ) .",
    "we then translate this result into the language of partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms and give a criterion for _ non_-accessibility , also in terms of expansion - contraction rates ( theorem c ) .",
    "both applications have strong limitations in that they apply only to a `` small '' set of systems .",
    "this is not surprising , since `` most '' distributions are not integrable .",
    "however , theorem c suggests that there is a certain trade - off between the size of the hlder exponent @xmath38 of the invariant splitting and accessibility : if @xmath38 is better than the standard lower estimate , accessibility is lost .",
    "this is illustrated by an example , due to an anonymous referee .",
    "if @xmath41 is a @xmath23-dimensional immersed submanifold of a riemannian manifold @xmath21 , @xmath42 will always denote its riemannian @xmath23-volume .",
    "if @xmath43 is a smooth map between smooth manifolds , @xmath44 will denote its derivative ( or tangent map ) @xmath45 . for non - negative functions",
    "@xmath46 , we will write @xmath47 if there exists a uniform constant @xmath48 such that @xmath49 .",
    "if @xmath47 and @xmath50 , we write @xmath51 .",
    "if @xmath52 is a metric space and @xmath53 , recall that a function @xmath54 is called @xmath25 hlder ( or just @xmath25 for short ) if @xmath55 the @xmath25-norm of @xmath56 is defined by @xmath57      we thank the anonymous referees for constructive criticism and the example at the end of the paper .",
    "while the paper was being revised for publication , jenny harrison pointed out that there are connections between theorem a and some of her work in @xcite .",
    "we start with a short overview of regularization of functions and the isoperimetric inequality .",
    "we briefly review a well - known method of approximating locally integrable functions by smooth ones , which will be used in the proof of the main inequality .",
