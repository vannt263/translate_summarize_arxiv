    "since the discovery of superconductivity in iron - based layered quaternary compound laofep@xcite , extensive efforts have been devoted to find new superconductors among this system.@xcite it is found that with the replacement of @xmath5 by @xmath6 and partial substitution of o with f , lao@xmath0f@xmath1feas changes into superconducting state below @xmath7.@xcite subsequently superconductivity at 25 k was also observed in la@xmath0sr@xmath1ofeas in which no f was added into the sample , therefore it was a hole - doped superconductor.@xcite more recently , superconductors lno@xmath0f@xmath1feas with light rare - earth substitution ( ln = ce , pr , sm ) were realized and superconducting transition temperature(t@xmath8 ) was raised to 52k.@xcite as to the heavy rare - earth element , however , single phase could not be easily formed and no superconducting state was observed below 2k . as to the element gadolinium which locates near the heavy rare - earth element , experimentally a drop of resistivity was observed below 10 k but with a residual resistivity down to 2 k.@xcite so it is worth exploring further that whether gdo@xmath0f@xmath1feas is also a superconductor with much higher @xmath9 . in this study , we report the superconducting properties of gdo@xmath2f@xmath3feas , the onset transition temperature t@xmath10 is about 36.6 k.",
    "polycrystalline samples gdo@xmath0f@xmath1feas ( x=0.12 , 0.15 , 0.17 ) were synthesized by conventional solid state sintering method .",
    "the raw materials are all with high purity(gd@xmath11 99.99% , gdf@xmath12 99.99% , fe 99.95% , as 99.99% , gd 99.99% ) .",
    "the detailed synthesis method is the same as that in the papers we reported previously.@xcite .",
    "the as - sintered pullet is concrete ceramic - like with dark - brown surface .",
    "x - ray diffraction measurement was performed at room temperature using an mxp18a - hf - type diffractometer with cu - k@xmath13 radiation from 10@xmath14 to 80@xmath14 with a step of 0.01@xmath14 .",
    "the magnetization measurements were carried out on a quantum design superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometer . the electrical resistivity and hall coefficient",
    "were measured by a physical property measurement system ( ppms , quantum design ) with a standard six - probe method .",
    "f@xmath1feas ( x=0.17 ) .",
    "it is clear that the dominant phase is gdo@xmath0f@xmath1feas .",
    "the asterisks mark the peaks from the impurity phase.,width=340 ]    fig.1 shows the x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) pattern of the sample gdo@xmath2f@xmath3feas .",
    "the pattern can be indexed in tetragonal space group with @xmath15 = @xmath16 = 4.001  and @xmath17 = 8.650  . obviously the phase is dominated by gdo@xmath0f@xmath1feas , though minor impurity phases still exist as marked by the asterisks .",
    "such impurity phases could be caused by the inadequate sintering temperature 1160 @xmath18 c in our experiment .",
    "the indices of the crystal lattice we obtained are consistent with the counterparts of lno@xmath0f@xmath1feas ( ln = ce , pr , sm)@xcite .",
    "fig.2 shows the temperature dependence of dc magnetization for sample gdo@xmath2f@xmath3feas .",
    "the diamagnetic signal appears below 22 k , a simple estimation on the magnetization at 2k reveals that the superconducting volume fraction is more than 40% .",
    "it should be noted that the response to magnetic field in the normal state of gdo@xmath2f@xmath3feas is paramagnetic with a minor value compared to diamagnetic value and such a contribution to magnetization is subtracted as a background ( the same to zfc and fc curve ) .",
    "f@xmath3feas measured in the zero - field - cooled ( zfc ) and field - cooled ( fc ) processes .",
    "a diamagnetic signal is easily observed at about 22 k , width=340 ]    the temperature dependence of resistivity of all three samples are shown in fig.3 .",
    "we can see that the resistivity shows an anomaly around 130 k , and this anomaly weakens with more f doping , such an anomaly and corresponding evolution with f doping have been observed in other fe - based arsenic compounds , however , the anomaly did not happen in nickel based arsenic system .",
    "the obvious disparity between fe - based and ni - based systems deserves to be further studied .",
    "both x = 0.15 and x=0.17 samples exhibit superconducting transitions and zero - resistance at a lower temperature .",
    "from the inset of fig.3 we can see the onset drop of resistivity about 36.6 k for x = 0.17 sample . as to gdo@xmath2f@xmath3feas , a slight hump near 130 k",
    "is also observed in resistivity curve , it suggests that t@xmath8 could be increased further as long as more fluorine were doped into gdo@xmath0f@xmath1feas .",
    "the transition width can also be narrowed in a refined fabrication process in the future .",
    "f@xmath1feas ( x=0.12,0.15,0.17 ) .",
    "the inset shows the enlarged view of superconducting transition area for the sample x = 0.17 .",
    "the onset transition temperature is defined at the point where the resistivity starts to deviate from the normal state background as marked by the straight line here.,width=340 ]    hall effect measurement for sample gdo@xmath2f@xmath3feas was shown in fig.4 .",
    "the transverse resistivities @xmath19 above t@xmath8 are all negative , indicating that the normal state conduction of gdo@xmath2f@xmath3feas is dominated by the electron - like charge carriers .",
    "the hall coefficient @xmath20 changes slightly at high temperatures but drops below 100 k. the value of @xmath21 is about -1@xmath22 at 100 k , compared with that of lao@xmath23f@xmath24feas , the value of hall coefficient is similar.@xcite an estimation based on the single band model gives a charge carrier density of 1@xmath25 .    f@xmath3feas ; ( b ) temperature dependence of hall coefficient for gdo@xmath2f@xmath3feas , the negative value indicates that the charge carrier is electron type.,width=340 ]",
    "in this study we report the fabrication and the superconducting properties of gdo@xmath0f@xmath1feas , as x is equal to 0.17 , gdo@xmath2f@xmath3feas is a superconductor with the onset transition temperature of about 36.6 k. resistivity anomaly near 130 k was observed for all samples , which is similar to that of lao@xmath0f@xmath1feas .",
    "hall coefficient suggests that gdo@xmath2f@xmath3feas is conducted by electron - like charge carriers .",
