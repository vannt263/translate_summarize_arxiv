    "to search for and quantify any possible correlations between the optical fluxes we used the dcf technique , as explained in section 3.3 .",
    "we searched for possible time lags , which could be used to probe physical conditions in the inner regions of agns .",
    "the shortest possible timescale of variability is normally associated with the changes occurring in jet emitting region , whose time scales are shortened by doppler beaming ..    for 3c 454.3 , on most of the nights the dcfs between the light curves in different optical bands peak at small time lags ranging from 0 hrs to 0.07 hrs which can not be considered significant as these time lags are close to the measurement intervals or might be due to photometric and systematic errors on individual data points of both lcs . according to white & peterson ( 1994 ) and peterson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , any detection of time lags is limited to lags longer than the lc sampling time scale , which prevents us from measuring time lags on time scales less than a few minutes . in order to further investigate this issue we performed a sf analysis to see if there was a discernable time scale of variability by following the description given in section 3.2 .",
    "this sf approach indicated that any time scale of variability is greater than or close to the total length of our observations , and therefore not reliable .",
    "also , any nominally positive sf results were not supported by the dcf results .",
    "we therefore conclude that our observations did not reveal any characteristic time scale of variability nor any time delays among the various optical bandpasses .",
    "the small frequency intervals in the optical regime lead to null or small time lags which implies that the photons in these wavebands * are emitting by the same * physical process and from the same emitting region .    for the fsrq 3c 279",
    ", the sf for the r band lc on jan 29 gives a hint of variability at 72 minutes from both sf and dcf analysis , but it is likely to arise from gaps in the lc . after that nothing significant is seen on 2014 feb 3 and 5 .",
    "for rest of the r band lcs of 3c 279 we do not find any timescale of variability as the shape of the sf indicates that any timescale of variability that might be present is greater than the length of our observation .",
    "plots are given in the online - only material .    from the sf evaluation of s5 0716 + 714 for the lc of 2012 jan 21 in i and v bands",
    ", we get a possible timescale of variability @xmath01.2 hrs in both the bands , which is to some extent supported by the dcf also . on march 23",
    "we observed the source in b , v , r and i. the sf and dcf for r band lc indicate a variability timescale of 1.44 hrs , while for the b , v , and i bands for the same day we get variability timescales of 1.92 hrs , 1.44 hrs and 1.44 hrs , respectively . the sf plot for the 2013 oct 27 lc displays a continuous rising trend that indicates that any timescale of variability exceeds the length of our observations .",
    "the nominal timescale of variability for the lc observed on 2014 jan 03 is found to be 2.4 hrs which is also supported by dcf analysis .",
    "moving on to 2014 feb we see from the r band lcs taken on feb 3 shows a possibility of intra - day variability timescale of 1.44 hrs from the sf analysis which is supported by dcf technique also . whereas on feb 4 and 5",
    "we see a continuous rising trend followed by a dip , thus giving possible variability timescales of 72 min and 86.4 min from both sf / dcf approaches .",
    "the sf and dcf plots for the target are displayed in the supplementary material while a sample of the same is given in fig .",
    "in this section we investigate any relationship between the optical variations in the ( b - v ) , ( v - r ) , ( r - i ) and ( b - i ) colour indices of the source and the brightness variations , which can be used to study colour behaviour and variability scenarios .",
    "the colour - magnitude plots for the * 9 nights in case of 3c 454.3 ( i.e. , 2013 sept 25 , 28 , oct 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , nov 04 ) and 6 nights for s5 0716 + 714 ( i.e. , 2012 jan 18 , 21 , march 20 , 22 , 23 and dec 14 ) * are displayed in the supplementary materials section while a sample of the same is displayed in fig .",
    "colour variation behaviours in blazars are still a topic of debate .",
    "a bluer - when - brighter ( bwb ) trend is commonly observed in blazars ( e.g. , raiteri et al .",
    "2001 ; villata et al .  2002 ;",
    "papadakis et al .",
    "2003 ; clements et al .",
    "2001 ; papadakis , villata , & raiteri 2007 ; rani et al .  2010 ; agarwal & gupta 2015 ) , in particular those of the hsp class , in which the optical continuum is generally believed to be entirely dominated by the non - thermal jet synchrotron emission . in lsp blazars , in which the accretion disc can provide a substantial contribution to the optical continuum , a redder - when - brighter trend sometimes indicates the increasing thermal contribution at the blue end of the spectrum , with decreasing non - thermal jet emission ( e.g. , miller 1981 ; villata et al .",
    "2006 ; raiteri et al .",
    "2007 ; gaur , gupta , & wiita 2012 ) .",
    "for each night , we have calculated a linear fit of the colour indices , ci , against v magnitude : ci = @xmath14v + @xmath15 .",
    "the corresponding fit values of the slope , @xmath14 , and the constant , @xmath15 , are reported in table 5 .",
    "the linear pearson correlation coefficient , @xmath16 , and the corresponding null hypothesis probability , @xmath17 , are also reported there .",
    "a positive slope indicates a positive correlation between the colour indices and apparent magnitude of the blazar which implies the general trend of bwb ( or redder - when - fainter ) whereas a negative correlation is observed for a negative slope , indicating a redder - when - brighter behaviour ( rwb ) .    for 3c 454.3 , we found significant positive correlations ( @xmath18 ) between the v magnitude and most of the colour indices on almost all nights except on 2013 oct 24 when the object exhibited a negative correlation . thus , the bwb trend was prominent during our observations .",
    "that the spectrum steepens as the brightness decreases can be clearly seen in the plots of 2013 sept 25 ( v - r ) , sept 28 ( v - r ) , oct 25 ( v - r ) , oct 27 ( v - r ) , oct 28 ( v - r and b - i ) , oct 29 ( b - i and v - r ) and nov 04 ( v - r ) .",
    "however , a rwb trend was found on 24 oct ( b - v and b - i ) when the spectrum becomes steeper as the source brightens , as evident from the plot . for other colours in the respective nights",
    "no correlation above the 95 per cent confidence level was present .",
    "thus the fsrq showed multiple instances of positive correlations and one single instance of a negative correlation , along with several colour - magnitude sets showing no correlations at all .",
    "in general , the bwb trend was prominent during our observations .    according to sasada et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , the colour  magnitude relationship varies among the outburst state , the active state and the faint state .",
    "3c 454.3 followed a bwb trend in the outburst state , whereas it exhibited a rwb trend in the faint state and again a bwb trend was associated with an active state . from section 4 , during the time span of our observations 3c 454.3 was @xmath19  mag fainter than the brightest known magnitude of @xmath20 , but brighter by @xmath21 mag than the faintest level of @xmath22 mag . hence it seems to be classified best as being in an active state ( out of the three states above ) and the colour behaviour obtained by us is consistent with those reported in sasada et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and gu & ai ( 2011 ) , according to which the rwb trend is rarely seen for fsrqs .",
    "though usually dominated by jets , the optical emission of blazars is generally a combination of jet and accretion disc photons . the optical emission from 3c 454.3 is possibly contaminated by thermal emission from the accretion disc , providing a slowly and weakly variable `` blue '' emission component , which may make a substantial contribution to the blue ",
    "uv continuum , as fsrqs are usually low - frequency synchrotron peaked sources ( e.g. , abdo et al .  2010 ) .",
    "the bwb trend , prevailing when the jet synchrotron emission completely outshines the accretion - disk emission , can be explained through an episode of more efficient acceleration of relativistic particles in the jet . in a relatively simple model , this can be represented an injection of fresh electrons with an energy distribtion harder than that of previous , partially cooled electrons ( e.g. , kirk , rieger , & mastichiadis 1998 ; mastichiadis & kirk 2002 ) .",
    "more detailed simulations of such a scenario , based on the solution of a fokker - planck equation of the electron distribution including first- and second - order fermi acceleration , have been done ( e.g. , chen et al .",
    "2011 ; diltz & bttcher 2014 ) .",
    "the latter work has demonstrated that , if an increased level of optical synchrotron emission is caused by a temporary decrease of the stochastic particle acceleration time scale , optical and ( synchrotron self - compton dominated ) x - ray emissions are expected to be anti - correlated , with the x - ray variations lagging behind the optical variations by several hours . * instead ,",
    "raiteri et al .",
    "( 2011 ) found a good correlation with a delay of about 1 day .",
    "* this is a prediction that could be tested with future , co - ordinated optical and x - ray monitoring observations of 3c 454.3 .",
    "we found significant positive correlation for s5 0716 + 714 e.g. on 2012 march 20 ( v - r and r - i ) , march 22 ( v - r ) , ( r - i ) & ( b - i),march 23 ( v - r ) and also on dec 14 ( v - r ) .",
    "no significant negative correlations are found , thus indicating that the bl lac tends to be bluer ( flatter ) when brighter on timescales of days , which may be due to the contribution of two components to the optical emission : one is the variable with a flatter slope ( @xmath23 ) ( f@xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 ) and the second one being the stable one with @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath23 . the bwb trend for this source",
    "was also given by villata et al .",
    "( 2000 ) during the 1999 webt campaign in a 72h optical lc . in the case of bl lacs ,",
    "any colour changes owing to accretion disc are highly unlikely , as the disc radiation is overwhelmed by that from the doppler boosted jet emission . therefore , shock based jet models are most likely to explain the observed colour variations ( e.g. , marscher & gear 1985 ; marcher et al .",
    "2008 ) , since radiation at higher frequencies is expected to emerge first followed by the flux at lower frequencies , thus producing a bluer colour during the early phase of a flare while a redder one appears during the later observation of the same flare , as it decays .",
    "sed properties of a source are an excellent way to investigate theoretical models .",
    "since simultaneous multi - frequency observations are difficult to attain it is much simpler to focus on a narrow region of em spectra like nir / optical , which could provide vast amount of information on flux and spectral variability that in turn can provide evidence about the emitting regions of the relativistic electrons , constrain the gamma ray emission models ( ghisellini el al .",
    "1997 ) and the contributions of emissions from jets ( synchrotron ) , blr , accretion disc , host galaxy and surrounding regions .    using our b , v , r and i observations along with the j & k band data points for 3c 454.3 available on the smarts webpage , for each particular night",
    ", we generated 9 nir  optical seds spanning 2013 sept 25 - nov 04 .",
    "for that purpose , we have subtracted galactic extinction , @xmath29 , obtained from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database from the optical / nir data points , to obtain extinction - corrected fluxes , which were then converted to @xmath30 fluxes .",
    "the resulting seds are displayed in fig .",
    "9 . from the figure it appears that a bump peaking in the v - b frequency range is present in the lower - brightness optical seds .",
    "it most likely corresponds to the little blue bump observed in quasars in the rest wavelength range @xmath0200  400 nm for which the strong emission lines from the blr seem to be responsible ( e.g. , raiteri et al .",
    "2007 ) . as expected",
    ", this feature disappears in the two brightest seds .",
    "the brightest sed for 3c 454.3 was measured on 2013 sept 25 .",
    "minor variations were seen in the seds for 25  28 oct after which it decayed day by day , reaching a minimum on 2013 nov 4 .",
    "[ sedfigure2 ] shows the sed of 3c 279 during 2014 jan to may covering nir to optical .",
    "we selected 9 days when there were quasi - simultaneous observations in b , v , r , i , j and k to perform a limited spectral analysis of the source .",
    "the nir and optical data have been corrected for galactic extinction following cardelli , clayton , & mathis ( 1989 ) using total to selective extinction ratio @xmath31 = 3.1 ( rieke & lebofsky 1985 ) .",
    "we find significant changes in nir region .",
    "we apparently are seeing a signature of one of the broad bumps peaking in the nir region , which should be the synchrotron component as it peaks in ir / optical bands in case of red blazars ( located between 10@xmath32  10@xmath33 hz ) .",
    "we get the brightest and faintest seds for 2014 feb 05 and apr 23 , respectively .    fig .",
    "11 shows optical - nir sed for the source s5 0716 + 714 , built with our b , v , r , i data sets for 7 different epochs with different brightness levels .",
    "magnitudes in all bands were corrected for galactic extinction .",
    "the synchrotron peak frequency has values between 10@xmath34hz and 10@xmath35hz .",
    "the seds seem to indicate a synchrotron peak in the near - ir . due to the lack of multi - wavelength data here ,",
    "a detailed description is difficult .",
    "the three blazars discussed in this paper are highly active , displaying outbursts across the whole electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "we explored the variability properties of 3c 454.3 , 3c 279 and s5 0716 + 714 using seven telescopes in bulgaria , india and greece during the 2011 through 2014 observing seasons .",
    "we also searched for colour variations on idv and short - term timescales .",
    "models to explain diverse time scale variability are broadly classified as intrinsic and extrinsic .",
    "intrinsic origins of agn variability are those associated with variations in the accretion flow and the relativistic jet .",
    "extrinsic mechanisms include interstellar scintillations which , due to its frequency dependence , are only relevant in low frequency radio observations and can therefore not be the case of optical inov .",
    "another external variability cause is gravitational microlensing , which is achromatic and is unlikely to be the sole cause of idv ( wagner & witzel 1995 ) .",
    "possible idv mechanisms in radio - loud agn are generally believed to be related to conditions in the jet , while in radio quiet quasars variability is likely due to the intrinsic variability of the accretion disc or related to a weak blazar component ( e.g. , stalin et al .",
    "the absence of idv may be due to a relatively stable relativistic jet with no irregularities in the jet flow .    the optical and multiwavelength flux variations in blazars , particularly in their high state ,",
    "are often interpreted in terms of relativistic shocks in the doppler boosted relativistic jets pointing at or nearly along our los ( e.g. , marscher & gear 1985 ) . in an unsteady jet , various instabilities , including turbulence behind shocks , changes in the direction from the los or other geometrical effects occurring within the jets may contribute to the variability of the non - thermal emission from blazars ( e.g. , camenzind et al .",
    "1992 ; gopal - krishna & wiita 1992 ) .",
    "however , the observed variability in the low state , when the non - thermal jet emission is less dominant over thermal emissions from the accretion disk , can sometimes be explained by accretion - disk - based models ( wagner & witzel 1995 ; urry & padovani 1995 ; including hotspots or instabilities in or above the accretion discs itself ( e.g. , chakrabarti & wiita 1993 ) .",
    "as the blazars are agns seen nearly face on , any irregularities related to the accretion disc will be visible directly in the low state .",
    "blazar emission in the post - outburst stage may be plausibly described in the framework of a shock - in - jet model ( e.g. , marscher & gear 1985 ; spada et al .",
    "2001 ; graff et al .  2008 ; joshi & bttcher 2011 ) .",
    "most of the blazar emission , especially in the active phase , is believed to be due to their jets lying close to the los and hence relativistically doppler boosted .",
    "shocks propagating down these relativistic jets are likely to play important roles in explaining the observed idv with emissions due to shock regions emitting over multiple wavebands with variability timescale decreasing as frequency increases .",
    "disc induced fluctuations when advected into the jet could be responsible for the changes in the physical parameters of the jet like its velocity , density or magnetic field ( e.g.  wiita 2006 ) . even slight variations caused in that way are doppler boosted by a factor of @xmath36 to @xmath37 ( e.g.  blandford & rees 1978 ) whereas the observed variability timescale is compressed by @xmath38 ( e.g.  gopal - krishna et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the presence of the quasi - power - law continuum is an indication of the synchrotron nature while flux variability was associated with a hardening of the synchrotron spectrum , implying a hardening of the underlying non - thermal electron distribution .",
    "the lack of any time delays among the optical bands is well explained by the small difference of the respective observing frequencies , implying small differences in the dynamical time scales of the radiating electrons , which are likely shorter than the expected light - travel time across the jet , with typical radial dimensions of the order @xmath39  @xmath40  cm .",
    "thus , any microphysical time delays would be washed out by light - travel time effects , even if the observational sampling rate would enable the detection of such delays .",
    "the hardening of the underlying electron distribution , leading to the observed bwb trend , may be well explained by a correlation between increasing synchrotron flux and more efficient electron acceleration , leading to an increased population of the highest - energy electrons . a plausible physical mechanism to achieve this would be an increased level of hydro - magnetic turbulence in the active region of the blazar jet , which would , to first order , lead to a shortening of the characteristic particle acceleration time scale .",
    "such a scenario has recently been modeled by diltz & bttcher ( 2014 ) who showed that individual flaring events caused by such parameter variations would lead to the observed bwb trend , along with an anti - correlation between optical and x - ray fluxes , with x - ray variations lagging the optical variability by up to several hours .",
    "this could be tested with future , co - ordinated optical and x - ray monitoring observations of @xmath41-ray blazars , in particular 3c 454.3",
    ". of course optical variability of bl lacs could be due to more than one mechanism , i.e. , a `` mild chromatic '' longer term component and a strongly chromatic shorter term component which are due to doppler factor variations , and intrinsic variations caused by particle acceleration in the doppler boosted relativistic jets ( e.g. , mastichiadis & kirk 2002 ) , respectively .",
    "we have performed multiband optical photometry for the blazars 3c 454.3 , 3c 279 , and s5 0716 + 714 between 2011 and 2014 to study flux and spectral variability on intraday , short and long time - scales .",
    "\\1 . during our @xmath0 37 nights of monitoring for idv",
    "we have found genuine flux variations , using c- and f - tests , on intraday time - scales for @xmath0 21 nights in b , v , r or i with amplitudes of variability up to 31 per cent for 3c 454.3 , 9.2 per cent for 3c 279 and 13.5 per cent for s5 0716 + 714 .",
    "each of the blazars seemed to be in an active stage and highly variable during the time span of our studies .",
    "the two fsrqs , 3c 454.3 and 3c 279 , both were recently in flaring states during the middle of the year 2014 .",
    "the stv was relatively weak for each blazar during our whole monitoring period .",
    "strong intra - night colour variations were found in some colour indices for some nights , but no consistent colour variations were found on a yearly basis .    \\4 .",
    "no significant time lags between the optical wavebands were detected , in agreement with expectations due to the small frequency separations of the optical wavebands .",
    "a bwb trend was observed to be dominant in our objects during our observations",
    ". such flattening of the optical spectrum with increasing flux may be interpreted as being dominated by jet synchrotron emission , where increasing flux is related to a hardening of the underlying non - thermal electron spectrum , possibly indicating an enhanced particle - acceleration efficiency .",
