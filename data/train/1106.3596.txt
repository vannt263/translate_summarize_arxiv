    "in recent years , a lot of effort has been devoted to the study of lorentzian stationary ( called also minimal ) timelike submanifolds of arbitrary dimension @xmath1 without boundary in the flat minkowski spacetime , namely to those @xmath2 that , whenever sufficiently smooth , satisfy @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the spacetime lorentzian mean curvature of @xmath5 , see for instance @xcite and references therein .",
    "a particular case , relevant in physics , is the one of surfaces , namely when @xmath6 . under this assumption ,",
    "minimal surfaces are called ( classical ) closed relativistic strings .",
    "equation is called the lorentzian minimal surface equation ; differently from the riemannian case , it can be regarded as a geometric evolution equation , which is hyperbolic in character , due to the signature of the lorentzian metric @xmath7 considered on the ambient space @xmath8 . a general short - time existence result of smooth solutions to has been obtained in @xcite .",
    "however , if one is interested in solutions defined also for long times , at least one relevant obstruction arises . as a matter of fact , unless the manifold is sufficiently close to a linear subspace @xcite , @xcite , generically singularities appear @xcite .",
    "the onset of singularities is one of the main motivations of the present paper : indeed , we are interested in weak solutions to the lorentzian minimal surface equation , which are globally defined in time . as we will see , our approach is based on the concept of _ lorentzian varifold _ , and is inspired by the notions of varifold and stationary varifold introduced by almgren @xcite and developed by allard in the euclidean and riemannian setting @xcite .",
    "there are several differences between the riemannian setting and the lorentzian one ; however , the notion of stationarity of a varifold remains the natural concept generalizing the zero mean curvature condition .",
    "concerning singularities , we point out that the varifolds representation of the evolving manifolds is parametrization free , so that in particular changes of topology are allowed",
    ". a relevant part of the present paper is devoted to the analysis of the concepts of area , first variation and rectifiability ( according to the proposed definition of weak solution ) and to the study of compactness and closure properties for the class of stationary lorentzian varifolds .",
    "several examples motivate and illustrate our theory .",
    "notice that the theory we develop here concerns nonspacelike ( or causal ) varifolds , as we are interested in generalizations of timelike minimal surfaces .",
    "insights on the analysis of come from the study of the asymptotic limits of solutions to the hyperbolic ginzburg - landau ( hgl ) equation .",
    "as shown in @xcite by a formal asymptotic expansion argument and for @xmath9 , smooth solutions to can be approximated by solutions to hgl .",
    "then , it has been rigorously shown in @xcite that solutions to hgl with well - prepared initial data converge , in a suitable sense , to a smooth lorentzian minimal submanifold , provided the latter exists . again , due to the presence of singularities , the validity of this convergence result is restricted to short times . on the other hand ,",
    "a preliminary analysis of the limit behaviour of hgl within the varifolds framework has been pursued in @xcite , without restricting to short times , but under rather strong assumptions on the limit varifold solution .",
    "in particular , in @xcite it is proposed a first notion of weak solution to that , in the language of the present paper , coincides essentially with what we have called here a stationary ( lorentzian ) rectifiable varifold with _ no part `` at infinity '' _ , that is no null ( or lightlike ) part .",
    "the assumptions made in @xcite exclude a priori various examples of weak solutions to , such as singular minimal surfaces where part of the energy is concentrated on null subsets of positive measure .",
    "in addition , a limit of a sequence of varifolds considered in @xcite is not necessarily a varifold of the same type even imposing uniform lower bounds on the densities .",
    "it is therefore necessary to relax the definition of rectifiable varifold . in definitions",
    "[ def : timerect ] and [ def : weaklyrectifiable ] we introduce the notion of _ rectifiable _ and _ weakly rectifiable varifold _ respectively , in the effort of covering all relevant examples of limits of minimal surfaces at our disposal we show that for a stationary one - dimensional varifold , the concepts of rectifiability and weak rectifiability coincide , under a mild condition on the supports . ] , and to hopely capture limits of solutions to hgl . in these two latter definitions , also null parts are taken into account ; in particular , a rectifiable varifold generalizes the notion of smooth nonspacelike ( or causal ) submanifold .",
    "one of the difficulties in adapting the varifold language to the hyperbolic case is related to the presence of null parts ( possibly with positive @xmath1-dimensional measure ) . in particular , troubles arise due to the lack of compactness of the embedding of the grassmannian of timelike @xmath1-planes into the space of matrices . roughly speaking , in order to keep the property that a sequence of varifolds with a uniform bound on the integral in time of the energy has a converging subsequence ,",
    "we are forced to define the varifolds on the compactification of the grassmannian .",
    "this produces a term `` at infinity '' in the varifold expression . in this respect ,",
    "we point out that we often find to be more natural to describe a varifold @xmath10 , splitted as a `` purely timelike '' part @xmath11 and a `` null '' part @xmath12 ( or part at `` infinity '' , which was excluded in @xcite ) , in two different sets of variables : namely , @xmath11 is expressed in the variables prior to the embedding ( and in these variables we denote @xmath11 by @xmath13 ) while @xmath12 is expressed in the compactified variables .",
    "it is worth noticing here that for a stationary varifold it is still possible to define the analog of the notions of relativistic energy and momentum , which _ turn out to be conserved quantities_.    to have a flavour of what kind of solutions we can include using the notion of weakly rectifiable varifold , take @xmath14 and @xmath6 , and consider the string - type solution ( introduced in @xcite ) starting at time zero from a square @xmath15 ^ 2 $ ] , with zero initial velocity . in figure",
    "[ fig : square3d ] we show the time - track of the solution ( the picture should be continued periodically in time for @xmath16 and then reflected for @xmath17 ) , see example [ exa : square ] for a detailed discussion .    :",
    "this solution must be extended by periodicity , height=151 ]    the interest in this example relies on the fact that it represents a lipschitz ( actually , a _ polyhedral _ ) minimal surface containing various null segments , which in figure [ fig : square3d ] are the four segments meeting at the upper vertex . if one describes parametrically this polyhedral surface as the image of a lipschitz map @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a weak solution of the linear wave system , it turns out that the set of all @xmath20 where ( @xmath21 exists and ) @xmath22 has positive lebesgue measure .",
    "therefore , in a parametric language , all these points should be considered as singular points .",
    "nevertheless , we can associate to such a solution a stationary weakly rectifiable varifold admitting the conservation of energy .",
    "while a stationary rectifiable varifold generalizes the concept of lorentzian minimal submanifold , a stationary weakly rectifiable varifold is rather a limit of stationary rectifiable varifolds and its support in @xmath8 is _ not _ , in general , a minimal submanifold , i.e. , is not necessarily satisfied even in regions where it is smooth : see for instance the cylindrical strings @xcite considered in example [ exa : sub ] .",
    "this phenomenon is due to possible strong oscillations of the tangent spaces and was , at a formal level , already observed in the paper @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the presence of oscillations of the tangent spaces requires to consider the barycenters @xmath23 ( resp .",
    "@xmath24 ) of a lorentzian orthogonal projection on the timelike part ( resp . on the null part ) of the varifold rather than the orthogonal projections @xmath25 ( resp .",
    "@xmath26 ) itself : this is reminiscent of the notion of generalized young measure @xcite , @xcite .",
    "even if the class of weakly rectifiable stationary varifolds is a rather huge set of weak solutions to , it still turns out to be not closed under varifolds convergence .",
    "as we shall illustrate in example [ exa : patologico ] , limits of stationary weakly rectifiable varifolds with a uniform energy bound are stationary , but may fail to be weakly rectifiable . on the other hand , we expect this closure property to be valid for one - dimensional varifolds .",
    "it can also be of interest to recall that the closure of two - dimensional minimal surfaces ( i.e. , strings ) has been completely charaterized , at least in a parametric setting , leading to the concept of subrelativistic string ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) : from the positive side , it turns out that the stationary varifolds we are proposing _ contain and extend _ the notion of subrelativistic string .    before summarizing the content of the paper ,",
    "another remark is in order .",
    "we do not have a weak - strong uniqueness result for our generalized solutions .",
    "in particular , assuming that the support of a stationary ( weakly ) rectifiable varifold with multiplicity one coincides with a regular solution to for short times , we do not know whether it coincides with such a solution as long as the latter is defined .",
    "we observe that , in view of splitting / collision example [ exa : collsplit ] , the condition that the varifold has multiplicity one is essential .",
    "we also note that it is not difficult to check that the subrelativistic strings verify such a uniqueness property , in view of the representation formula .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following .",
    "in section [ sec : not ] we introduce some notation and some standard definitions from lorentzian geometry . in section [ sub :",
    "themap ] we describe our embedding of the set of timelike @xmath1-planes in the vector space of all @xmath27 real matrices ( definition [ def : pr ] ) , and its compactification @xmath28 via the map @xmath29 ( definition [ def : mappa ] ) .",
    "we also need to describe the embedding of all null @xmath1-planes , see formula .-",
    "planes are in the boundary of the grassmannian of timelike @xmath1-planes , compare the proof of lemma [ lem : compact ] . ] some necessary tools of geometric measure theory are given in section [ sub : gmt ] .",
    "on the basis of the definition of lorentzian projection on an @xmath30-dimensional subspace ( definition [ rapk ] ) , the lorentzian tangential divergence of a vector field is given in formula .",
    "our first result is theorem [ lem : areanonparametrica ] , where we find an expression of the lorentzian @xmath1-dimensional area element ( denoted by @xmath31 in the sequel , to keep distinct from the euclidean @xmath30-dimensional hausdorff measure @xmath32 ) independent of parametrizations , namely @xmath33 here the covector field @xmath34 with time - space components @xmath35 is defined as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is a _",
    "distinguished _ vector in the normal space ( see definition [ def : pr ] ) , and @xmath38 is the euclidean norm .",
    "we stress that is valid in arbitrary codimension @xmath39 . in corollary",
    "[ cor : area ] we express @xmath40 using the horizontal velocity vector @xmath41 defined in , possibly also integrating first in time and then on the time - section .",
    "we conclude section [ sub : gmt ] with theorems [ teo : gg ] and [ no ] ( first variation of area ) which , together with formula , represent a first link between geometric measure theory and classical lorentzian differential geometry . in section [ sec : timelike ] we introduce the class of test functions @xmath42 ( definition [ deftest ] ) : the definition is given in such a way that the recession function @xmath43 ( definition [ def : recession ] ) is well defined for any @xmath44 .",
    "the class @xmath45 of lorentzian varifolds is introduced in definition [ defvar ] , in duality with the class @xmath42 .",
    "stationarity is introduced in definition [ defsta ] : it is based on formula , and on the notion of lorentzian tangential divergence .",
    "the definition is formally the same as in the riemannian case , and ( as in that case ) it acquires a clear meaning looking at the first variation of area , in this case the lorentzian @xmath30-dimensional area @xmath46 .",
    "the splitting of a varifold into its timelike part @xmath11 and its null part @xmath12 is given in definition [ def : vzerovinfinito ] , and the ( already mentioned ) measure @xmath13 is defined in .",
    "the disintegrations of these three measures are given in of section [ subsec : disi ] , through which we can write the action of a varifold on a test function in a more useful way ( lemma [ lem : azione ] ) . in the same section",
    "we introduce the barycenters @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "these are concepts involving only the part of @xmath10 on the grassmannian ( see definition [ defbar ] ) and are crucial in the study of weakly rectifiable varifolds , which are often obtained as weak ( and strongly oscillating ) limits of smooth timelike lorentzian minimal surfaces .",
    "proper , rectifiable and weakly rectifiable varifolds are introduced in section [ sec : firstproperties ] , together with some preliminary properties .",
    "it is interesting to observe that , under suitable circumstances , it is still possible to derive a distributional stationarity equation in the weakly rectifiable case : this is accomplished in section [ unce ] .",
    "section [ seccons ] has a central role : here we prove various conservation laws for stationary varifolds . to properly introduce the notion of relativistic energy and momentum ( definition [ def : enemome ] )",
    "we need to disintegrate the projected part on @xmath8 of the varifold using the lebesgue measure on the time - axis : see .",
    "the analog quantities in case the varifold reduces to a smooth timelike submanifold are the usual relativistic energy and momentum , see remark [ rem : consrett ] . in section [ sub : relstri ]",
    "we prove one of the main results of the paper , namely that _ it is always possible to associate with a relativistic string a stationary rectifiable varifold _",
    "( theorem [ senzalabel ] ) , _ and with a subrelativistic string a stationary weakly rectifiable varifold _ ( theorem [ senzanome ] ) .",
    "we believe these two results to be an encouraging indication for the validity of our notion of generalized solution to the lorentzian minimal surface equation . examples of varifolds associated with relativistic and subrelativistic strings are given in section [ subkink ] , in particular cylindrical strings and the already mentioned polyhedral string .",
    "section [ secexa ] treats two other examples , the second one being rather interesting .        in the first example [ exa : subspace ]",
    "we show that our theory allows to rigorously prove that a null @xmath30-plane is minimal , despite the fact that normal vectors in this case are not well defined .",
    "the second example [ exa : collsplit ] describes a one - dimensional varifold associated with a splitting ( or , using time reversal , a collision ) .",
    "we consider an incoming half - line , for instance a vertical half - line @xmath47 , with a real positive multiplicity @xmath48 on it ; next we make the half - line split , at a triple junction @xmath49 , into two timelike half - lines @xmath50 , @xmath51 : see figure [ fig : creation ] .",
    "we then focus on the following problem : which conditions one must impose on the splitting angles @xmath52 , @xmath53 and on the multiplicity @xmath54 on @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) in order figure [ fig : creation ] to represent a stationary @xmath57-varifold in @xmath58 ?",
    "this problem has a ( nonunique ) solution , which can be obtained inspecting the weak notion of stationarity around the triple junction .",
    "it turns out that solutions are obtained imposing a sort of weighted balance condition at @xmath59 involving the three lorentzian normal vectors to the three half - lines : see equation and figure [ fig : vectors ] .",
    "interestingly , the problem can be equivalently solved imposing the conservation laws , see equations .",
    "we also discuss the case when @xmath52 and @xmath53 tend to the null directions . in section [ sec : pathological ] we present an elementary example concerning the limit of a zig - zag piecewise affine curve having only null directions ( example [ exa : zigzag ] ) , and two rather pathological examples .",
    "in example [ exa : patella ] we show a not rectifiable stationary purely singular varifold , obtained as a limit of a sequence of rectifiable stationary varifolds ; in example [ exa : patologico ] we show a not rectifiable stationary purely diffuse varifold , obtained as a limit of a sequence of rectifiable stationary varifolds .",
    "these two examples illustrate the difficulty of characterizing the closure of the class of ( weakly ) rectifiable varifolds . in the appendix ( section [ sec : mea ] ) we recall various concepts from measure theory , in particular the generalized radon - nikodm theorem ( theorem [ th : grn ] ) , and the disintegration of a measure ( theorem [ th : disint ] ) needed throughout the paper .",
