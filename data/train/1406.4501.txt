    "the coefficient of the magneto - electric term @xmath199 , respectively for wsm , double - wsm and triple - wsm .    when magnetic field is applied along @xmath32-direction , corresponding charge density is given by @xmath200 the first term gives rise to layer quantum hall effect with thickness @xmath201 accounting for the contribution from one - dimensional chiral surface states , residing at the boundary of wsms , which can be observed in arpes experiments .",
    "the second term is new and arises from contribution of scattered states bound to the bulk of the wsm , the zlls .",
    "decomposing this term as @xmath202 , we find that second term is corresponds to one - dimensional charge - density , while the first one accounts for the degeneracy of zll in wsms ( @xmath203 ) , double - wsms ( @xmath204 ) and triple - wsm ( @xmath205 ) .",
    "effect of this term shows up only where @xmath206 jumps , i.e. , at the interface of wsms with vacuum .",
    "hence , the bulk anomalous term @xmath207 gives rise to surface hall conductivity in wsms , and through bulk - boundary correspondence theory remains anomaly free .",
    "therefore , by comparing the separation of weyl nodes from arpes and surface hall conductivity one can extract the contribution from the second term in @xmath207 arising from the bulk axionic cdw order .",
    "so far , we have discussed the effect of axionic density - wave in the uniform phase .",
    "the @xmath46 cdw order can also allow the existence of topological defects , e.g. _ line vortex _ or _ axion - string _ , along the @xmath32-direction . for simplicity",
    "we consider the vorticity to be _",
    "one _ and restrict ourselves in the _ dilute _ vortex limit .",
    "the line vortex accommodates @xmath208-number of chiral one - dimensional dispersive gapless fermionic modes in its core that carries nondissipative electric current in @xmath32-direction , determined by one dimensional chiral anomaly @xmath209 with @xmath210 respectively for wsm , double - wsm and triple - wsm @xcite .",
    "this current in turn is pumped from the bulk radially , which is captured by the bulk axionic term @xmath207 , according to the _ callan - harvey _ mechanism @xcite .",
    "the exact solution of the dispersive modes can readily be obtained upon multiplying solutions of precise zero energy modes bound to a _ point vortex _ in the @xmath171 plane @xcite , with the plane - wave factor @xmath211 .",
    "existence of such one - dimensional gapless dispersive modes will manifest in a t - linear specific heat in the ordered phase when it accommodates line - vortex , which is distinct from t@xmath212 specific heat in the normal phase of three - dimensional wsms .",
    "to summarize , we here propose that both dirac and weyl semimetals can undergo a weak coupling instability towards the formation of a cdw order in the presence of strong magnetic fields . due to separation of weyl nodes , which naturally occurs in wsm and due to the zeeman coupling in trivial as well as topological dsm",
    ", the cdw order spontaneously breaks the translational symmetry and represents an axionic phase of matter . in this work",
    ", we demonstrate the effect of such mass generation on the renormalization of charge , diamagnetic susceptibility and also analyzed the scaling behavior of the spectral gap with the strength of sub - critical interactions and magnetic field .",
    "similar mechanism has been argued to be operative in double- and triple - wsms , where due to the additional degeneracy of the zll a larger gap can possibly be realized .",
    "furthermore , we staunchly argued that among that charge- and spin - density waves , both of which can led to a spectral gap at the weyl points , the former one wins energetically since it pushes the filled lls down in energy .",
    "thus our proposed axionic phase of matter can be realized in topological dsms , such as cd@xmath8as@xmath7  @xcite , na@xmath7bi  @xcite , recently found wsms in taas  @xcite , nbas  @xcite , tap  @xcite , ybmnbi@xmath8  @xcite , sr@xmath9mnsb@xmath8  @xcite , as well as in various three - dimensional strong - spin orbit coupled materials , such as bi@xmath8se@xmath7 , when these systems are placed in close vicinity of the quantum critical point between topological and normal insulating phases .",
    "in addition , proposals for realizing double - wsm in hgcr@xmath8se@xmath12 @xcite , srsi@xmath8  @xcite give a genuine hope that axionic cdw orders , corrections to dms , anomalous transport behavior can be observed in various members of the weyl family in near future .",
    "besides the uniform ground state , we also considered the role of topological defects in the ordered phase .",
    "due to the associated @xmath46 angle in the axionic - cdw phase , the ordered phase can support line vortex , also known as axion - string . in the dilute vortex limit with single vorticity , we show that such defects hosts @xmath208-number of one - dimensional gapless propagating mode , localized in its core , where @xmath199 for wsm , double - wsm and triple - wsm , respectively .",
    "thus the number of gapless modes is intimately tied with the topological invariant of the system .",
    "such dispersive mode carries non - dissipative electric current which in turn is supplied radially from the bulk , through the callan - harvey mechanism .    as a final remark",
    ", we comment on the role of disorder .",
    "notice that axionic - cdw in weyl , double- and tripple - weyl semimetals breaks the translational symmetry due to momentum space separation of the weyl nodes .",
    "most likely , periodicity of such cdw order is incommensurate with the lattice periodicity .",
    "therefore , axionic - cdw can be susceptible to generic _ disorders _",
    "@xcite , which may reduce the ordering temperature considerably .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that in sufficiently clean systems and strong magnetic fields , a sizable mass gap can be observed at low-@xmath192 .",
