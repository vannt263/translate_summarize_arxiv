    "when the incident photon energy of inelastic x - ray scattering is far from the absorption edge , the scattering occurs without resonance enhancement .",
    "this is called nonresonant x - ray scattering ( nixs ) .",
    "nixs has been used to measure both phonon and electronic excitations . among electronic excitations ,",
    "charge excitations are capable by nixs , since photons are predominantly scattered by charge .",
    "therefore , the dynamical density structure factor is detectable with nixs ,  @xcite and thus nixs has some complementary aspects with inelastic neutron scattering .",
    "@xcite    the plane wave involved in the matrix element of nixs can be expanded with respect to momentum transfer . in the high momentum - transfer region ,",
    "multipole transitions become relevant , and thus nixs using high - energy x - ray has a unique capability of measuring higher multipole transitions . by using this characteristic of nixs ,",
    "a possible observation of orbiton excitations in manganites has been proposed .",
    "@xcite dipole - forbidden local @xmath0-@xmath0 excitations in mott insulators , nio and coo , have successfully been observed via high momentum - transfer nixs measurements .",
    "@xcite the experimentally observed data have been analyzed theoretically on the basis of the first - principles calculations and cluster approaches .",
    "@xcite furthermore , effective operators for the @xmath0-@xmath0 excitations have also established and their application to manganites has been proposed .",
    "@xcite    in itinerant 3@xmath0 electron systems , there is no clear localized @xmath0-@xmath0 excitation but corresponding excitations related to orbital degrees of freedom exist .",
    "therefore , it would be challenging to detect such orbital excitations by nixs in high momentum - transfer region .",
    "a good example of multi - orbital systems where the orbital degree of freedom is believed to be crucial for their physical properties would be iron - based superconductors .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we demonstrate a possible realization of orbital - selective electronic excitations in the antiferromagnetic phase of iron arsenides by nixs .",
    "the antiferromagnetic phase is obtained by using the mean - field approximation for a five - orbital hubbard model and dynamical susceptibilities are calculated within the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
