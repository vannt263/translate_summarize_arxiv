    "during the last two decades , the theory of toric varieties has produced a strong pervasion among many mathematical areas , such as symplectic geometry , commutative algebra , toric topology etc .",

    "these two kinds of @xmath12-manifolds ( @xmath13 or @xmath1 ) have two special properties : the group action is locally standard and the orbit space is a simple convex polytope . generally , the local standardness of the @xmath12-action on @xmath3 makes sure that the orbit space @xmath14 is a nice manifold with corners .",

    "since the @xmath5-action on @xmath3 is locally standard , the action of @xmath192 on the unique @xmath48-dimensional component ( i.e. , @xmath88 ) of @xmath188 is still locally standard .",
    "therefore , the boundary of @xmath15 is tessellated by patches that are orbit spaces of some @xmath88 s with locally standard @xmath84-actions .",
    "in fact , if @xmath193 is a closed surface with a locally - standard @xmath84-action , its orbit space @xmath73 is a @xmath48-manifold with corners and @xmath194 is not empty .",
    "we know from  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 4.2 ) that @xmath195 where @xmath50 is the number of vertices in @xmath73 ( i.e. , the number of the points fixed by the @xmath84-action ) .",

    "since @xmath198 , so @xmath199 since @xmath200 is not empty",
    ". then @xmath201 and @xmath73 is homeomorphic to the 2-disk @xmath202 , so @xmath73 must be a @xmath48-gon .      thus , topologically the boundary @xmath49 must consist of some @xmath48-spheres , each of which is covered by @xmath48-gon facets such that each vertex of @xmath15 meets exactly @xmath2 facets .",
    "so each boundary component of @xmath15 is actually a union of exactly three 2-gons , as shown in figure  [ p:3-lens ] .",
    "suppose that @xmath15 has @xmath203 boundary components ( @xmath48-spheres ) .",
    "if @xmath204 , then we can do an equivariant cut - and - paste operation between @xmath205 and @xmath206 , which is stated in terms of orbit spaces as follows : cut out an open neighborhood @xmath207 of a boundary component @xmath208 of @xmath15 and an open neighborhood @xmath209 of the boundary component of the solid three - edged footbal @xmath110 , and then glue them together along the new boundaries , as shown in figure  [ p : fill_ball ] .",
    "write @xmath210 . on the other hand ,",
    "this operation is invertible with respect to @xmath205 and @xmath211 ; in other words , we can cut out a small open @xmath2-ball @xmath212 from the interior of @xmath213 and a solid three - edged football @xmath110 respectively , and then glue them along the new boundaries to get @xmath15 , as shown in figure  [ p : glue_ball ] .",
    "thus , @xmath214 , where @xmath215 is the equivariant connected sum along free orbits . since @xmath216 , @xmath217 still contains some @xmath48-spheres as in figure  [ p : glue_ball ] , so @xmath218 is still a connected @xmath2-manifold .",

    "now we know that @xmath221",
    ". we can still carry out the operation @xmath222 as above , and still denote it by @xmath211 .",
    "then it is easy to see that @xmath213 becomes a closed manifold ! in this case , all the orbits of the @xmath5-action on @xmath218 are free orbits . but @xmath218 may not be connected . notice that each connected component of @xmath218 must be a covering space of @xmath213 , whose covering cardinality divides @xmath223 . by the equivariance of the @xmath5-action , @xmath218 must have @xmath224 or @xmath223 connected components .",
    "topologically , the possible relations between @xmath3 and @xmath218 are shown in figure  [ p : glue_mfd ] , figure  [ p : glue_mfd_seimfree ] and figure  [ p : glue_mfd_free ] .",
