    "there are several different types of isolated neutron star : radio pulsars some of which also radiate in other bands of the electromagnetic spectrum ; dim radio quiet neutron stars ( drqnss ) which are dim in x - rays , not detected in radio band and all of which are connected to supernova remnants ( snrs ) ; dim isolated thermal neutron stars ( ditnss ) which are also dim in x - rays and not detected in the radio , and which have long spin period ( p ) contrary to drqnss ( except geminga which has short spin period but which shows ditns characteristics ) ; anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) and soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) which have l@xmath3/@xmath41 ( where l@xmath3 is the x - ray luminosity and  is the rate of rotational energy loss ) with long spin periods and which show gamma ray bursts and x - ray flares .",
    "radio pulsars are believed to be born on the upper - left part of the p - p diagram and evolve to the right part .",
    "some radio pulsars ( some of which have also been detected in x - rays ) are located on the lower - left part of the diagram ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the birth locations of these pulsars on the diagram is an open question .",
    "more importantly , the birth locations of sgrs / axps and ditnss on the diagram are also unclear .",
    "if we can identify some sources which are younger appearances of these different types of neutron star , we can guess where they come from on the diagram , and furthermore , we can have more information on different characteristics of these neutron stars .",
    "there are 2 galactic isolated pulsars which have some different characteristics compared to other isolated pulsars .",
    "these 2 pulsars are j1846 - 0258 ( p=0.32359795 s , p=7.09706@xmath510@xmath6 ss@xmath7 , which is connected to snr kes 75 @xmath8 ) and j1811 - 1925 ( p=0.064667 s , p=4.40@xmath510@xmath1 ss@xmath7 , which is connected to snr g11.2 - 0.3 @xmath8 ) . both of these pulsars have been identified as x - ray pulsars with strong x - ray emission compared to drqnss and ditnss , but none of them has been detected in radio band .",
    "they seem to have very dense environments @xmath9 .",
    "in addition to these 2 x - ray pulsars , there is a pulsar in large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) which has strong x - ray emission but which is very dim in radio band .",
    "this pulsar ( j0540 - 69 ) also seems to have a very dense ambient medium .    in section 2 ,",
    "the observational data of these pulsars and their snrs are examined and the possibility that these pulsars can be in early phases of different types of neutron star is discussed . in section 3 , conclusions are given .",
    "the position of j1846 - 0258 on the p - p diagram together with its possibly small average braking index ( n=1.86@xmath100.08 with the assumption of no glitch and/or significant timing noise @xmath11 ) suggest that this pulsar may be in a phase preceding sgrs / axps ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of j1846 - 0258 is on the order of 10@xmath12 erg / s @xmath13 which is typical for sgrs / axps .",
    "moreover , the l@xmath3/ value is @xmath00.016 @xmath14 which is very large compared to radio pulsars ( more than 6 times larger than l@xmath3/ value of crab pulsar ) . for sgrs / axps l@xmath3/ @xmath4 1 ( the name anomalous comes from this fact ) and if the x - ray luminosity of j1846 - 0258 does not drop significantly in the next @xmath010@xmath11 yr its l@xmath3/ value will be similar to those of sgrs / axps .",
    "even if j1846 - 0258 has n=2 - 2.5 ( n=2 corresponds to constant p ) because of some glitches , this pulsar comes to a position above the position of axp 2259 + 586 and probably above the positions of ditnss assuming that the three ditnss for which only the upper limits on p are known have positions close to the position of j0720.4 - 3125 on the p - p diagram ( fig.1 ) .    according to blanton & helfand @xmath15 snr kes 75 ( g29.7 - 0.3 ) has an age @xmath010@xmath9 yr .",
    "it is better to adapt the age of the pulsar ( which can be @xmath01700 yr ) as the age of kes 75  j1846 - 0258 pair considering the possibly small value of n of the pulsar and also the large diameter of the snr @xmath16 . for n=2 ( i.e. for constant p ) , j1846 - 0258 can reach to a spin period @xmath02.5 s in 10@xmath11 yr .",
    "ages of the snrs connected to axps are a few times 10@xmath11 yr @xmath9 . in ( 2 - 5)@xmath510@xmath11 yr j1846 - 0258",
    "can come to the region of axps / sgrs on the p - p diagram .",
    "j1846 - 0258 seems to be in a very dense medium @xmath9 and snr kes 75 is expanding into a higher density medium on its far side @xmath17 . as suggested by guseinov et al .",
    "@xmath9 the progenitor of j1846 - 0258 can be an o - type star .    in guseinov",
    "@xmath18 the idea of possible existence of low - mass neutron stars has been introduced to explain the positions and possible evolution of sgrs / axps on the p - p diagram without any need for very high magnetic field ( b@xmath1910@xmath20 g ) .",
    "magnetic dipole radiation of neutron stars is given as @xmath21 @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the magnetic moment , @xmath24 the angular velocity , c the speed of light , @xmath25 the angle between the rotation axis and the magnetic field axis , b@xmath26 the real dipole magnetic field and r the radius of neutron star .",
    "on the other hand , the rate of rotational energy loss of spherically symmetric neutron stars which have rigid body rotation is given as @xmath27 where i is the moment of inertia , p the spin period of pulsar , and p the time derivative of p. from expressions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) we get @xmath28 where m is the mass of pulsar .",
    "so , a neutron star with m@xmath00.5 - 0.7 m@xmath29 must have @xmath04 - 9 times larger p compared to a neutron star with m@xmath01.4 - 1.5 m@xmath29 if both neutron stars have the same b@xmath26 and p values ( considering also the increase in r when m is smaller ) .",
    "for such a low mass neutron star the propeller mechanism can work more efficiently to spin down the pulsar in relatively very short time and the reconnection of the magnetic field can occur more easily to produce the @xmath30-ray bursts .",
    "x - ray pulsar j1846 - 0258 can be such a low mass pulsar .",
    "its possibly small n and its position on the p - p diagram support the low - mass neutron star idea .",
    "moreover , the x - ray luminosity and the present l@xmath3/ value of this x - ray pulsar further suggest that it can be in a phase preceding sgr / axp phase . also , j1846 - 0258 is an isolated x - ray pulsar without any detected radio emission similar to sgrs / axps . besides",
    ", such low mass neutron stars must have b@xmath31 = 3@xmath510@xmath32 - 10@xmath20 g @xmath18 ; j1846 - 0258 is only @xmath01700 yr old and its b=5@xmath510@xmath32 g. if j1846 - 0258 is the former appearance of all sgrs / axps , then we can say that such objects must have o - type progenitors .    in guseinov et al .",
    "@xmath33 sgrs / axps were claimed to be in active stages of their evolution and they predicted that these sources would spend some time in passive stages ( i.e. they must become unobservable occasionally ) .",
    "xte j1810 - 197 has recently been identified as a transient axp and it was seen that this source was unobservable in the past @xmath32 proving the prediction of guseinov et al .",
    "so , this type of neutron star is possibly born with p@xmath34@xmath010 - 30 ms and evolves to the right part of the p - p diagram either with increasing p or with p@xmath0const . as an isolated strong x - ray pulsar .",
    "it reaches to the sgr / axp region in ( 2 - 5)@xmath510@xmath11 yr and shows @xmath30-ray bursts and x - ray flares .",
    "occasionally , it drops to a passive state and its luminosity drops significantly that it becomes unobservable .",
    "the lack of any detected radio emission from x - ray pulsar j1846 - 0258 and from sgrs / axps can be due to the existence of ionized gaseous wind which must suppress the radio pulsar phenomenon when their periods are very small ( in less than @xmath010@xmath9 yr ) .",
    "x - ray / radio - dim pulsar j0540 - 69 in lmc is one of the youngest and most luminous rotation powered pulsars @xmath20 .",
    "it was first observed as a 50 ms x - ray pulsar @xmath35 and later it was detected as a faint radio pulsar with a 640 mhz flux @xmath00.4 mjy @xmath36 . it s",
    "p value is 4.8@xmath510@xmath37 s / s @xmath20 .",
    "the average braking index of this pulsar is small ( n@xmath02.2 @xmath38 ) that it comes to a position close to ditns rx j0720.4 - 3125 in @xmath010@xmath16 yr which must be about the age of ditns rx j0720.4 - 3125 ( @xmath0cooling age ) . because of this",
    ", j0540 - 69 can be in a former phase of at least some of the ditnss .",
    "similar to j1846 - 0258 , l@xmath3/ of j0540 - 69 is large compared to radio pulsars @xmath16 .",
    "when j0540 - 69 reaches to a position close to the present position of rx j0720.4 - 3125 ( which has l@xmath3/ @xmath0 10 ) , it will have l@xmath3/ @xmath4 1 .",
    "there is a pre - sn ring around j0540 - 69 similar to the rings around sn1987a and the hourglass nebula around the blue supergiant sher 25 @xmath39 .",
    "the pulsar is connected to oxygen - rich snr 0540 - 6944 @xmath40 .",
    "there is a co cloud located to the west of the remnant but it is not clear if the snr is interacting with it or not @xmath40 .",
    "the region surrounding the snr has a rich hi structure @xmath40 .",
    "the pre - sn ring around this pulsar similar to the rings seen around sn1987a @xmath39 and its dense environment suggest that the progenitor of this pulsar must be an o - type star .",
    "x - ray pulsar j1811 - 1925 is in a very dense medium @xmath9 .",
    "the swept - up mass is 3 - 4 m@xmath29 @xmath41 and the ejected mass should be considerably larger than the swept - up mass @xmath42 .",
    "snr g11.2 - 0.3 is similar to snr cas a in this sense and the progenitor of it must be an o - type star ( possibly early o - type )",
    ".    the spin down age of pulsars can be calculated as @xmath43\\ ] ] where p@xmath34 is the initial spin period of pulsar .",
    "snr g11.2 - 0.3 is probably related to the supernova ( sn ) of 386ad @xmath44 .",
    "if j1811 - 1925 is the compact remnant of sn 386ad , then its age ( t ) is 1618 years .",
    "then , if its p@xmath34@xmath062 ms @xmath45 , its n must be @xmath011 . if p@xmath34 is less than 62 ms , then n must be larger than 11 .",
    "for n=3 and p@xmath34=62 ms , t is about 1970 years .",
    "if n=3 and t=1618 years , then p@xmath34 must be 0.064666999929 s ( i.e. very close to the present p value of j1811 - 1925 , which is 0.06466700 s ) .",
    "this is not possible because the present p value of j1811 - 1925 is 4.40e-14",
    "s / s and in 1618 years there must be a change in the p value at least in the third digit after the decimal point unless n is much less than 2 .",
    "so , the realistic values are : t=1618 yr , p@xmath34@xmath062 ms , n@xmath011 . with such a braking index",
    ", j1811 - 1925 can reach to its present position ( p=0.06466700 s and p=4.40e-14 s / s ) on the p - p diagram in 1618 years starting with p@xmath34@xmath062 ms .",
    "so , this pulsar seems to be evolving downwards on the p - p diagram with a sharp decrease in p and very small increase in p. radio / x - ray pulsars in the region @xmath46",
    "= 10@xmath47 - 2@xmath510@xmath15 yr are displayed in figure 1 .",
    "most of such pulsars are located on the lower left part of the diagram . on this part of the diagram , there are also some radio pulsars which have not been detected in x - rays .",
    "x - ray pulsar j1811 - 1925 seem to be evolving in the direction to the region of these radio / x - ray and radio pulsars .",
    "x - ray luminosity of j1811 - 1925 is @xmath010@xmath48 - 10@xmath49 erg / s and the x - ray luminosity of the radio / x - ray pulsars in this region is 10@xmath50 - 10@xmath49 erg / s @xmath51 .",
    "the large n value of j1811 - 1925 indicates that either there is magnetic field decay ( see geppert & rheinhardt @xmath52 for the magnetic field decay in neutron stars and see bisnovatyi - kogan @xmath53 for a review on magnetic field of neutron stars in general ) or the angle between the spin axis and the magnetic field axis is decreasing sharply .",
    "the lack of detected radio emission from j1811 - 1925 may be due to selection effects ( luminosity function or beaming fraction ) or maybe the radio emission of this x - ray pulsar is screened by some dense plasma around it .",
    "axp 1e 2259 + 586 is connected to snr ctb 109 and the age of this snr is @xmath010@xmath11 yr @xmath54 that axp 1e 2259 + 586 has n@xmath040 .",
    "note that j1811 - 1925 must have such a very large n if it has p@xmath34@xmath010 ms which is generally assumed to be a typical p@xmath34 value for radio pulsars .",
    "although they may have similar slope of tracks on the p - p diagram , note that axp 1e 2259 + 586 and j1811 - 1925 are located on very different parts of the p - p diagram ( see fig.1 ) that their origins must be different .      all these 3 pulsars must have o - type progenitors .",
    "the progenitors of j1811 - 1925 and j0540 - 69 can be more massive than the progenitor of j1846 - 0258 , and possibly the progenitor of j1811 - 1925 can be more massive than the progenitor of j0540 - 69 . since their positions on the diagram and their braking indices seem to be very different compared to each other , different physical processes must be dominant for each of them .",
    "mass of the neutron star can be the main parameter for different physical processes to occur .",
    "other than the mass of the progenitor , closeness of the binary and mass of the companion star before the sn explosion ( i.e. before the disruption of the binary system ) , and the fact that the progenitor might be isolated must be considered to understand the formation of different types of neutron star .",
    "if the progenitors of these 3 pulsars had actually very different zero age main sequence mass values compared to each other , these pulsars may have very different masses compared to each other .",
    "differences in their n and p values , and their positions on the diagram together with the observational data about their environments support this idea . among these 3 pulsars , j1846 - 0258 has the largest p ( comparable to some axps ) and the smallest n value that it may have the smallest mass ( possibly @xmath00.5 - 0.7 m@xmath29 ) .",
    "similarly , j0540 - 69 may be less massive than j1811 - 1925 .",
    "x - ray pulsars j1846 - 0258 and j1811 - 1925 are two extreme cases and their initial parameters must be very different compared to each other .",
    "differences in their mass and initial magnetic field ( or p@xmath31 ) values must be the main factors for the significant difference between their evolutions .",
    "these differences must be the cause of the difference between their n values ; in the case of j1846 - 0258 , the neutron star may have smaller mass and larger radius ( extended atmosphere ) and higher initial magnetic field so that it has large ( and possibly increasing ) p , whereas in the case of j1811 - 1925 , the neutron star must have lower initial magnetic field and possibly much more massive than j1846 - 0258 that its b value drops sharply due to either magnetic field decay or a decrease in the angle between the magnetic field and the spin axes .",
    "in order to understand if some of these pulsars evolved through massive binaries , central regions of the snrs connected to these 3 pulsars must be examined to see if there are o or b - type stars present which are connected to the snrs .",
    "failing to find such ob stars may lead to the fact that the progenitors were either isolated or in binary systems with later type companions , but also note that the sources being located at large distances can make it difficult to realize the presence of such ob stars .",
    "x - ray pulsar j1846 - 0258 seems to be evolving to become sgr / axp in @xmath010@xmath11 yr .",
    "it can be a low - mass neutron star which has an o - type progenitor .",
    "x - ray pulsar j1811 - 1925 has a small p which is decreasing sharply .",
    "this x - ray pulsar can be in a former phase of the radio / x - ray and radio pulsars on the lower left part of the p - p diagram ( fig.1 ) .",
    "the progenitor of j1811 - 1925 must be an o - type star , possibly more massive than the progenitors of the other 2 pulsars .",
    "which type a neutron star will become must depend on its progenitor s mass and on the effects of the binary evolution .",
    "for the 3 pulsars examined in this work , mass of the progenitor may be the main parameter for the mass and hence the type of the neutron star .",
