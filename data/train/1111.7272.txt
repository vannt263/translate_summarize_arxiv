    "therefore , for large , fixed values of @xmath7 , increasing @xmath96 has the effect of removing a significant noise contribution , thereby increasing @xmath18 and decreasing the ratio @xmath10 .",

    "we note that , because of our normalization condition , the curves intersect at @xmath160 . calculations for the echo sequence are shown in fig .  [ fig : pivot](b ) , which shows a similar dependence of @xmath17 on @xmath16 . for both sequences , the dependence of @xmath6 on @xmath7 is minimal for @xmath162  hz , the highest computed @xmath16 .",
    "this dependence is easily understood for the echo sequence , which is sensitive only to noise at @xmath92 . as @xmath16 approaches @xmath121 ,",
