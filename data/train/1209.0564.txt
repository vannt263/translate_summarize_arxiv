    "the concept of a frozen qcd coupling was introduced long ago ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) and is still quite popular nowadays ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite- @xcite ) .",
    "the origin of the term comes up with the divergent infrared behavior of the well - known rg -expression for @xmath0 : the frozen coupling is a constant and therefore it can be used in the ir domain .",
    "another motivation for introducing the frozen coupling is that the perturbative qcd coupling is running , and accounting for the running @xmath0 effects should have been done in every calculation .",
    "however , this makes some qcd calculations quite complicated , so for rough estimates , it might be convenient to use some effective coupling which mimics the running of @xmath0 in the perturbative region and also can be used beyond it .",
    "the values of the frozen couplings are usually fixed from purely phenomenological considerations to get an agreement with experimental data .",
    "quite often the frozen coupling is used in combination with other phenomenological parameters to describe hadronic reactions ( e.g. parton distributions , etc ) , which makes more involved fixing its value . a fixed @xmath0",
    "has often been used in various calculations done in the framework of the leading logarithmic approximation ( with the leading contributions being either double- or single- logarithms , depending on the situation ) where the most important logarithmic contributions are totally resummed , while @xmath0 is treated as a fixed parameter and its argument is set a posteriori from physical considerations .",
    "in contrast , in the present paper we suggest a novel way to define the fixed ( frozen ) coupling , which does not involve any analysis of experimental data and does not coincide with the often used generalization of the dglap - parametrization @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "we begin by considering the parametrization of @xmath0 in the evolution equations . in particular",
    ", they could be the dglap equations@xcite or the generalizations of them@xcite to the small-@xmath7 region , or the bfkl equation@xcite .",
    "we show how the effective running coupling present in the equations can be replaced by a constant coupling fixed at some scale both in the double - logarithmic ( dla ) and single - logarithmic ( sla ) approximation . in order to set the scales in dla , we use the principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms ) suggested in ref .",

    "pms has also proved to be efficient in the analysis of electro - production of vector mesons@xcite and for setting the scale of the bfkl pomeron@xcite",

    "this scaling is not sensitive on whether the coupling is running or fixed .",
    "in the present paper we have suggested a novel way to define the frozen qcd couplings and fix their value .",
    "the definition of a frozen couplings comes from the analysis of the effective coupling in the evolution equations .",
    "it depends on whether the leading logarithms are double- or single- logarithmic .",
    "the value of the dl couplings has been fixed by applying the principle of minimal sensitivity .",
    "we have found a value @xmath1 for the dl coupling for a time - like argument ( non - singlet structure functions and scattering amplitudes in the forward kinematics with a non - vacuum quantum numbers in the @xmath103 -channel ) and @xmath3 for a space - like argument ( e.g. for the scattering amplitudes in the hard or backward kinematics , @xmath77 -annihilation and dy processes ) .",
    "in contrast , our result for the values of the sl couplings contributing to the bfkl pomeron intercept and other important reactions is less rigorous .",
    "our estimate for the value of sl coupling at time - like argument is @xmath165 and when the argument is space - like , the coupling is @xmath166 . in order to check our estimates ,",
    "we have compared them to the results available in the literature and at the same time independent of other phenomenological parameters . by doing so",
    ", we have considered the intercepts of dis structure functions .",
    "the comparison shows that the use of our frozen dl couplings for the intercepts of the non - singlet structure functions differs from the more accurate calculations@xcite ( which account for the running coupling effects ) by @xmath167 . on the other hand the discrepancy between our estimate for the intercept of bfkl pomeron and the results of ref .",
    "@xcite ( where an alternative setting of the scale is used ) is also within @xmath168 .",
