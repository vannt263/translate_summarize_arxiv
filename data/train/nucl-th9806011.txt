    "the purpose of the present work is the determination of the ground state mass of the vector @xmath5 bound state within the dyson - schwinger ( ds ) and bethe - salpeter ( bs ) approach @xcite .",
    "the starting point is the 2-point correlation function @xmath6 for the vector quark currents @xmath7 , with @xmath8 a quark field . within the approximations used in the present paper , which will be described below , @xmath9",
    "is determined by the dressed quark propagator @xmath10 and the vertex 3 point function @xmath11 .",
    "the objective of this work is to study the large - time behavior of the 2-point correlator in euclidean space in order to determine the mass of the lowest vector meson , as in lattice gauge calculations @xcite and instanton models @xcite .",
    "qcd sum rules also consider the euclidean 2-point correlator , but attempt to determine the ground state mass by using the borel transform to isolate the lowest mass pole @xcite .",
    "our method should be seen in contrast to an earlier approach , which solves the bs equation on shell @xcite .",
    "we now briefly review the ds - bs approach used here .",
    "the nonperturbative nature of qcd at low and intermediate momentum transfers makes the use of effective models a natural and necessary tool . during the past few years strong progress",
    "has been made in the framework of the dyson - schwinger ( ds ) approach @xcite , which is based on a coupled set of relations between dressed quark , gluon and ghost propagators and vertex functions . in order to handle this system",
    "it is of course necessary to make certain simplifications and truncations .",
    "one approach , which is commonly referred to as _ rainbow _ approximation , uses an undressed quark - gluon vertex and solves the dyson - schwinger ( dse ) for the dressed quark propagator @xmath12 with a given dressed gluon propagator @xmath13 as input ( c.f .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] ) : @xmath14 the quark propagator @xmath15 and the quark self energy @xmath16 are related by : @xmath17 the form of the gluon propagator @xmath13 for small momenta is basically unknown from qcd and therefore has to be modeled while following certain requirements which will be discussed below . in case of this special truncation",
    "it is possible to formulate an effective field theory using functional integral techniques , which is known as the global color model ( gcm)@xcite . this has the striking advantage that in the chiral limit ( zero current mass for the light quarks , i.e. @xmath18 ) one is able to establish an easy connection between the dressed quark self energy leading to dynamical chiral symmetry breaking on one side and the existence of massless goldstone bosons as pseudoscalar @xmath5 bound states , on the other side . as a consequence it is possible to perform a systematic chiral low energy expansion @xcite in terms of composite goldstone boson field and therefore make a connection between the phenomenological chiral hadronic theory ( chiral perturbation theory ) @xcite and an effective quark based theory of qcd , the gcm .",
    "+ furthermore one is also able to study the coupling of composite @xmath5 systems to an external electromagnetic gauge field while guaranteeing local @xmath19 gauge invariance which is manifest in the corresponding ward - takahashi identity @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the chiral invariance and electromagnetic current conservation , which are both essential for studying low energy hadronic phenomena , are very difficult to maintain if one tries to go beyond the rainbow approximation@xcite and are lost in general if model anstze for the quark - gluon vertex are used .",
    "though the rainbow approximation and the gcm naturally violate local color @xmath20 gauge invariance and renormalizability , they provide a very successful description of various nonperturbative aspects of strong interaction physics and the qcd vacuum as well as hadronic phenomena at low energies .",
    "these include for instance quark confinement @xcite , qcd vacuum condensates @xcite , @xmath21 breaking and the @xmath22 splitting @xcite , low energy chiral dynamics of goldstone bosons ( @xmath23 ) @xcite , meson form factors @xcite , heavy - light mesons @xcite , systems at finite temperature @xcite or soliton @xcite and fadeev @xcite descriptions of the nucleon .",
    "the method is more involved when applied to higher mass states instead of goldstone bosons , e.g. @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 or @xmath27 mesons .",
    "a mesonic @xmath5 bound state with mass @xmath28 in a channel with spin - flavor index @xmath29 is determined in the ladder approximation as solution of the _ homogeneous bse _",
    "@xcite : @xmath30 where we have used the notation @xmath31 .",
    "the @xmath32 is related to the bethe - salpeter amplitude @xmath33 as : @xmath34    as mentioned above in the pseudoscalar channel the existence of a massless state or in other words a solution of ( [ bs ] ) at @xmath35 is automatically guaranteed in the chiral limit if the rainbow dse ( [ sd ] ) is satisfied . for a small finite current quark mass @xmath36",
    "a perturbative expansion in @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be performed .",
    "this is however not possible for larger meson masses and therefore an explicit numerical solution of the corresponding homogeneous bse ( [ bs ] ) is required .",
    "the trouble hereby is that the meson momentum is defined in the timelike region , @xmath38 , which in turn requires the dressed quark propagator @xmath12 in the timelike region .",
    "however @xmath12 is a priori only determined at spacelike @xmath39 from the dse ( [ sd ] ) , because the model gluon propagator @xmath40 is defined only for spacelike euclidean momenta .",
    "it is therefore necessary to perform an analytic continuation of the dressed quark propagator @xmath12 from euclidean space into minkowski space @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "this is a very dangerous and unsafe procedure because it requires in fact the knowledge of the singularity structure of @xmath12 in the whole complex plane , which we do not have . in ref .",
    "@xcite an alternative method has been proposed which stays completely in euclidean space avoiding analytic continuations of any of the dressed propagators .",
    "it is the analog to what is used in instanton models @xcite and lattice qcd calculations @xcite where working in euclidean space is essential .",
    "the 2-point correlation function @xmath42 with quark currents @xmath43 , where @xmath29 stands for the spin - flavor of the operator @xmath44 , is determined as a quark loop containing the dressed vertex function @xmath45 ( c.f .",
    "fig.[fig2 ] for @xmath46 ) .",
    "the @xmath45 itself is given as the solution of the _ inhomogeneous _ ladder bse ( c.f .",
    "fig.[fig3 ] ) : @xmath47 with the inhomogeneity @xmath48 .",
    "this form can also be written as @xmath49 where t@xmath50 is the bare vertex and @xmath51 is the nonperturbative dressed vertex .",
    "the nonperturbative parts of the vertex functions can be constrained by the forms of the nonlocal condensates @xcite , which also has been used in our recent work @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown that this formalism can be used for the nonperturbative part of the vector vertex function used at low momentum transfer for nuclear magnetic dipole moments@xcite .",
    "this gives possible constraints for the dressed vertex function treated in the present work , which we discuss below .",
    "the momentum @xmath52 is in general off shell and can be either space or timelike .",
    "close to the mass shell @xmath53 the @xmath54 and the solution of the homogeneous bse ( [ bs ] ) @xmath55 are related by @xmath56 in our study the @xmath37 will be always spacelike .",
    "other than the dressed quark or gluon propagator the correlator @xmath57 has a known kalln - lehmann spectral representation @xcite : its poles are at @xmath58 , where the @xmath59 are the meson resonance masses and the pole residua are basically given by the couplings @xmath60 between the interpolating current @xmath61 and the on - shell states @xmath62 .",
    "otherwise @xmath63 is holomorph in the complex plane and falls off sufficiently fast for @xmath64 , so that cauchy s theorem can be applied .",
    "a convenient method to filter out the lowest state with mass @xmath1 is to take the the one dimensional fourier transform of ( [ corr1 ] ) with respect to the time component of the euclidean momentum @xmath65 @xmath66 which falls off as @xmath2 for large euclidean times @xmath3 .",
    "it is obvious that this method will work in reality only if the ground state mass @xmath1 is sufficiently well separated from the mass of the first excited state @xmath67 .",
    "if @xmath1 and @xmath67 are too close it will be numerically difficult to extract the exponential falloff , because this situation will require numerical very large values for @xmath3 in order to see the falloff and for those large values the signal is likely to be swamped by numerical errors due to highly oscillating behavior of @xmath68 .",
    "on the other hand it is clear that we have indeed avoided to make any assumption about the analyticity of the propagators .",
    "instead we are using the analyticity structure of the 2-point correlator @xmath63 in the complex plane , which is well under control . the price which we have to pay",
    "is the fact that we have to solve the inhomogeneous bse over the whole range of spacelike @xmath37 instead of the homogeneous bse at only the on shell point @xmath69 .",
    "it is the aim of our paper to perform the first analysis of the 2-point correlation function in the vector channel ( i.e. @xmath46 ) using this approach and to extract the ground state mass @xmath1 .",
    "we will work in the chiral limit ( @xmath18 ) , therefore isospin effects are not present .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite we will use a model gluon propagator @xmath70 with an ir regularized mandelstam @xmath71 singularity @xcite at @xmath72 . for large @xmath37 an asymptotic",
    "free uv tail is added .",
    "the parameters in @xmath70 are fixed in such a way that the weak pion decay constant in the chiral limit @xmath73 is reproduced and , as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite a satisfactorily description of low energy chiral physics and vacuum condensates can be achieved .",
    "we demonstrate that the dressed quarks which are determined from the rainbow dse ( [ sd ] ) are confined in the sense that the quark propagator does _ not _ show an exponential falloff @xmath74 for large @xmath3 .",
    "we then demonstrate the existence of a bound state in the vector channel by showing the exponential falloff of the correlator @xmath75 for large @xmath3 from which we can determine the ground state mass @xmath1 .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we briefly review the definition of the dressed quark propagator @xmath15 and the vector vertex @xmath76 as well as the rainbow dse for @xmath15 and the inhomogeneous bse for @xmath76 and demonstrate the validity of the vector ward - takahashi identity .",
    "we then show in section 3 how to obtain the expression for the vector 2-point correlator and its fourier transform in euclidean space .",
    "the numerical results for gluon and quark propagators , vertex function and correlator are presented , analyzed and discussed in section 4 .",
    "finally , conclusions are offered in section 5 .",
    "following ref . @xcite the inverse of the dressed quark propagator g(p ) has the form @xmath77 + \\sigma(p )   \\equiv i \\gamma \\cdot p a(p^2 ) + b(p^2 )   \\label{quarkpropagator}\\ ] ] in momentum space .",

    "@xcite both the rainbow dse ( [ sdesigma ] ) and the ladder bse ( [ ibsemomentum ] ) can be _ consistently _ derived from the action of the global color model ( gcm ) in an external gauge field @xmath85 using standard functional integration techniques .",
    "the main steps of this derivation are reviewed in appendix a and b.    a crucial consequence is that this formalism ensures by construction invariance under local @xmath19 gauge transformations . at the level of the dressed vertex @xmath76 this invariance is reflected in the validity of the _ ward - takahashi identity ( wti ) _ : @xmath86 which can be easily verified by substituting it into ( [ ibsemomentum ] ) and using the dse ( [ sdesigma ] ) for the quark self energy @xmath16 as well as the definition ( [ quarkpropagator ] ) .",

    "furthermore it turns out to be convenient to perform a decomposition into longitudinal and transversal components with respect to the external momentum @xmath87 :    [ decomp2 ] @xmath94    the eight scalar dimensionless coefficients @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) and @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) depend on @xmath99 , @xmath37 and @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the direction cosine between @xmath102 and @xmath52 .",
    "@xmath103 is the vector transverse to @xmath87 , i.e. @xmath104 . the advantage of the decomposition ( [ decomp2 ] ) lies in the fact that the longitudinal components @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) are determined automatically from the quark propagator @xmath15 by means of the wti ( [ wti ] )    [ llong ] @xmath105    where @xmath106 .",

    "this one has to project out the single @xmath97 for each @xmath107 which can be done by multiplying ( [ decomp1 ] ) and ( [ decomp2 ] ) with appropriate dirac matrices and taking traces .",
    "performing the same operations on the r.h.s of ( [ ibsemomentum ] ) leads finally to a set of 5 coupled linear inhomogeneous integral equations for the @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) @xcite : @xmath108 the indices @xmath107 and @xmath109 are both running from @xmath110 to @xmath111 .",

    "in perturbation theory it can be renormalized in the standard way using dimensional regularization @xcite . in our case",
    "it is actually not necessary to evaluate @xmath160 , because we need only its fourier transform @xmath161 , which is uv finite , as any correlator in coordinate space is uv finite .",
    "the reason for that is that the quark propagator , which falls off like @xmath162 in momentum space , will fall off like @xmath163 after fourier transform , and therefore the momentum integral @xmath164 in ( [ picomp ] ) is uv finite .",
    "when evaluating @xmath161 from ( [ picomp ] ) it is therefore convenient to perform the fourier transform @xmath165 _ before _ the momentum integral @xmath164 , which avoids a conceptual and technical intricate renormalization procedure .",
    "our model gluon propagator has the form @xmath166 where @xmath167 the first term @xmath168 ( [ dir ] ) , which dominates for small @xmath37 , is a regularized mandelstam ansatz @xcite with a strength @xmath169 and an ir regulator @xmath170 , which models the ir strength of the quark - quark interaction . the second term @xmath171 ( [ duv ] ) , which dominates for large @xmath37 is an asymptotic uv tail and matches the known 1-loop renormalization group result with @xmath172 , @xmath173 and @xmath174 @xcite .",
    "the model parameters @xmath175 and @xmath170 are adjusted to reproduce the weak pion decay constant in the chiral limit @xmath73 .",
    "we are using 3 different parameter sets :    [ sets ] @xmath176    the forms of @xmath70 are displayed in fig.[fig4 ] , which also shows for comparison the pure uv form @xmath177 . as one can see in all 3 cases the asymptotic form is reached already for @xmath178 . in ref . @xcite it has been shown that with those values a satisfactorily description of all low energy chiral observables can be achieved .",
    "the second step is the determination of the dressed quark propagator ( [ quarkpropagator ] ) as solution of the coupled set of integral equations ( [ sde : a ] ) and ( [ sde : b ] ) .",
    "fig.[fig5 ] displays the running constituent mass @xmath179 at spacelike @xmath180 . in order to demonstrate that the quarks are confined one has to show that the quark propagator @xmath181 has no poles in the timelike region @xmath182",
    "this can again be done by studying the fourier transform with respect to the euclidean time @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "it is sufficient to consider the scalar part @xmath183 : @xmath184 if @xmath12 had a pole at @xmath185 the fourier transform @xmath186 would fall off as @xmath187 for large @xmath3 or @xmath188 \\sim - m t \\label{gst}\\ ] ] as we can see from fig.[fig6 ] @xmath189 $ ] is far from rising linearly with @xmath3 , at large @xmath3 , it actually rises quadratically with @xmath3 .",
    "this shows that the the parameter set ( [ sets ] ) produces indeed confined quarks .",
    "the third step is now to solve the inhomogeneous bse , i.e. the coupled set of 5 inhomogeneous linear integral equations ( [ integraleq ] ) .",
    "we follow the numerical procedure from ref .",
    "one applies a gauss quadrature using about @xmath190 gauss points for @xmath191 and @xmath192 gauss points for both @xmath193 and @xmath194 .",
    "it should be noticed that the angular integration over @xmath195 is running only over the the gluon propagator @xmath196 and not over the functions @xmath197 .",
    "this transforms the integral equations into an high dimensional set of ordinary inhomogeneous linear equations for the @xmath198 at the gauss points , which is solved by inverting the @xmath199 coefficient matrix using standard packages @xcite .",
    "other than in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the quark self propagator @xmath15 which appears in the kernel of the bse ( [ ibsemomentum ] ) has been parameterized by a simple analytic form without solving the dse ( [ sde ] ) explicitly , we are using the numerical solutions @xmath27 and @xmath82 of ( [ sde ] ) in the kernel for the bse ( [ ibsemomentum ] ) .",
    "our treatment is therefore a fully consistent solution of both the rainbow dse for the quark propagator @xmath15 and the inhomogeneous ladder bse for the vector vertex function @xmath76 using the same model gluon propagator @xmath196 specified in ( [ ddef ] ) as input .",
    "as one can see from ( [ ibsemomentum ] ) and ( [ integraleq ] ) this involves a numerical interpolation of @xmath200 and @xmath201 to the points @xmath202 .",
    "fig.[fig7 ] displays the coefficient functions @xmath203 for the parameter set 1 ( [ set1 ] ) for a fixed spacelike value of @xmath204 and a fixed angle @xmath205 . as one",
    "can see our result is qualitatively similar though quantitatively noticeably different than the one from ref .",
    "similar than ref .",
    "@xcite we also find that the @xmath206 are only very weakly dependent on the angle @xmath207 if @xmath99 and @xmath37 are fixed .",
    "finally fig.[fig8 ] shows our main result , the fourier transformed correlator @xmath208 for large euclidean times @xmath3 evaluated with the three sets ( [ sets ] ) .",
    "as mentioned earlier it is essential to evaluate the fourier integral @xmath209 before doing the integral over the quark momentum @xmath210 in order to avoid uv infinities . from fig.[fig8 ] we see clearly that @xmath208 has an exponential falloff @xmath211for large @xmath3 and moreover that the ground state mass @xmath1 is practically the same for all three parameter sets , because the curves are parallel .",
    "the ground state mass @xmath1 can be extracted by carrying out a linear fit to the numerical result .",
    "one finds @xmath212 for all three sets .",
    "this has to be compared with the phenomenological values of @xmath213 for the ground state vector meson mass . the instanton liquid model @xcite finds @xmath214 , whereas quenched lattice qcd @xcite obtains @xmath215 .",
    "to summarize : we have studied a @xmath5 bound state in the vector channel using a nonlocal and confining model quark - quark interaction , which respects all global symmetries of qcd .",
    "the model parameters have been chosen to give a good description of low energy chiral physics for the goldstone degrees of freedom ( @xmath216 , @xmath217 , @xmath92 ) .",
    "for the first time we have demonstrated the existence of a higher mass state by evaluating the correlator of 2 interpolating vector currents in euclidean space and showing the exponential falloff of its fourier transform at large euclidean times .",
    "this employs a consistent treatment of the dressed quark propagator @xmath15 and the dressed vector vertex @xmath76 , which are both determined from the model quark - quark interaction by the rainbow dyson - schwinger equation for @xmath15 and the inhomogeneous ladder bethe - salpeter equation for @xmath76 .",
    "the method stays until the end in euclidean space and all momenta are spacelike .",
    "this avoids any unsafe analytic continuations of the dressed propagators into the timelike region .",
    "we have found that the ground state mass is practically independent on the parameters of the model interaction and lies at about @xmath218 .    for the creation of a bound state",
    "it is obviously necessary to have an highly nonlocal quark - quark interaction , which is reflected in its large nonperturbative strength in the ir .",
    "this leads not only to dynamical chiral symmetry breaking but also to a strong momentum dependence of the running dynamical quark mass @xmath219 and , in our case even to confined quarks .",
    "this is an important advantage over with the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) interaction @xcite , which can be regarded as a special case of the gcm with a local quark - quark interaction @xmath220 and has been subject to extensive studies @xcite .",
    "the njl model has a momentum independent constituent mass @xmath221 and is therefore not confining . though it gives a satisfactorily description of the physics of associated with the goldstone degrees of freedom ( @xmath216 , @xmath217 , @xmath92 ) it has trouble to deal with higher @xmath5 bound states , which are lying around the @xmath222 threshold and are therefore unstable or barely stable against decay into a quark - antiquark pair .",
    "as long as ground state properties are considered , the method which we have used can also be applied to other channels , such as e.g. the axial vector mesons , as well as to 3-point functions , which are the basis for the study of meson form factors @xcite .",
    "the only implicit assumption which we have to make is the existence of a sufficiently large gap between the ground state and the first excited state .",
