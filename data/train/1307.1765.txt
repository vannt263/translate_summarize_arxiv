    "one of the outstanding theoretical problems in high energy heavy ion collisions is the understanding from first principles of the pressure isotropization and possibly the thermalization of the gluonic matter produced in these collisions .    from rhic and lhc data ,",
    "there is ample evidence that the expansion and cooling of this matter is well described by relativistic hydrodynamics @xcite with a very small viscosity ( characterized by a viscosity to entropy density ratio , @xmath2 , that is fairly close to the value @xmath3 obtained in the strong coupling limit of some qcd - like theories @xcite , and that has been conjectured to be a lower bound ) .",
    "this good agreement also suggests that the anisotropy between the transverse and longitudinal ( with respect to the collision axis ) pressures is not too large , because otherwise the viscous corrections could be important and spoil this agreement .",
    "however , understanding from first principles why the hydrodynamics models work so well has proven very challenging until now .",
    "moreover , there is also a vast amount of data , ranging from deep inelastic scattering to proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions , supporting the idea of gluon saturation in high energy collisions involving hadrons or nuclei @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "the gluon density in the projectiles becomes very large , leading to important non - linear corrections in the evolution of the gluon distribution with energy .",
    "these nonlinear effects dynamically generate a dimensionful scale , the saturation momentum @xmath4 , that controls the scattering @xcite .",
    "the gluon occupation number is non - perturbatively large , of order @xmath5 , for transverse momenta below @xmath4 , and decreases rapidly above this scale .",
    "the saturation momentum increases with the energy of the collision , to reach values of order @xmath6gev for nuclei at lhc energies .",
    "since the value of the strong coupling @xmath7 at such scales is around @xmath8 , one may expect to be able to describe these collisions in the color glass condensate effective theory @xcite , that describes the physics of gluon saturation at weak coupling .",
    "for this reason , the cgc appears to be a well suited framework in order to try to explain the early isotropization of the system .",
    "the state of the system just after such a collision has been calculated at leading order in @xmath7 in the cgc framework @xcite , and one finds that its energy - momentum tensor is very anisotropic , with a negative longitudinal pressure exactly opposite to the energy density ( a trivial consequence of the fact that the chromo - electric and chromo - magnetic fields are parallel to the collision axis just after the collision @xcite ) . at leading order",
    ", the subsequent time evolution never leads to the isotropization of the stress tensor @xcite .",
    "but it has been noticed long ago that the cgc result at leading order is insufficient , because of the existence of instabilities in the classical solutions of the yang - mills equations @xcite : some of the higher order ( in @xmath7 ) corrections grow exponentially fast with time , and soon become larger than the leading order they are supposed to correct .",
    "these instabilities are the manifestation in the cgc framework of the well known weibel instabilities in plasmas with an anisotropic particle distribution @xcite . moreover",
    ", a lot of work suggests that these instabilities could play an important role in driving the system towards isotropization and local thermal equilibrium @xcite .    in the cgc formalism",
    ", these instabilities spoil the naive estimates of the order of magnitude of contributions @xcite , since these estimates usually keep track only of the powers of @xmath7 , implicitly assuming that all the numerical prefactors remain of order unity at all times . in the presence of unstable modes , this is no longer true : some of these coefficients will grow exponentially in time , leading to secular divergences when the time goes to infinity  and making the ordinary loop expansion useless after a finite time of order @xmath9 .",
    "an improved power counting that tracks these fast growing terms was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it was shown @xcite that one can resum the fastest growing terms by superimposing random gaussian fluctuations to the initial condition of the classical yang - mills equations , and then averaging over these fluctuations . thanks to this resummation , one completely tames the secular terms , and the validity of the resummed result is extended to larger times .    as a proof of concept , this resummation was implemented numerically in the case of a @xmath10 scalar field theory .",
    "although very different from a yang - mills theory in many respects , this theory has several similar features : it is scale invariant in 3 + 1 dimensions at the classical level , and its classical solutions have instabilities ( here due to parametric resonance ) .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that after performing the gaussian average over the fluctuations of the initial classical field , the system evolves towards the equilibrium equation of state , and that its transverse and longitudinal pressures become equal in the case of a system expanding in the longitudinal direction .",
    "moreover , the origin of this resummation scheme ( and in particular the fact that it includes the exact nlo result ) completely prescribes the ensemble of these fluctuations : their spectrum can be obtained by computing a 2-point correlator in the presence of a non - trivial background field ( the solution of yang - mills equations at leading order ) . from the analysis of next -",
    "to - leading order corrections done in @xcite , this 2-point function can be constructed as follows @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the solution of the yang - mills equations linearized around the classical cgc background , whose initial condition at @xmath13 is a plane wave of momentum @xmath14 , polarization @xmath15 and color @xmath16 .",
    "however , this calculation has never been done so far .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , an alternative way of computing these fluctuations was proposed , based on the existence of an inner product between pairs of these fluctuations ( written here in terms of the proper time @xmath17 , the rapidity @xmath18 and the transverse coordinate @xmath19 ) , @xmath20 @xmath21 denotes the electrical field associated to the gauge potential @xmath22 , defined as  : @xmath23 the above inner product is conserved when the fluctuations evolve over the classical background .",
    "it is also easy to check that the modes obtained by evolving plane waves from the remote past form an orthonormal ( with respect to the above inner product ) basis of the vector space of fluctuations .",
    "it was then suggested that one may avoid solving the linearized equations of motion for the fluctuations from the remote past , and that it could be sufficient to find a complete set of modes that obey the equations of motion locally near a proper time @xmath24 just after the collision has taken place , provided that this set of modes also form an orthonormal basis in the above sense .",
    "solving this alternate problem is simpler because one needs only to find _ local _ solutions of the linearized equations of motion , instead of global solutions with prescribed initial conditions at @xmath13 .",
    "the reasoning in @xcite was that if one knows a set of orthonormal modes at the time @xmath17 , even if it is not the same set as the one originating from the plane waves , it would generate the same gaussian ensemble of fluctuations provided that the two basis can be related by a unitary transformation . and",
    "it is also clear that unitary transformations preserve the inner product defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : centralps ] ) .",
    "it turns out that there is a caveat in this argument : there are also non - unitary transformations that preserve the inner product .",
    "such a transformation , when applied to a basis of fluctuation modes , will leave all the inner products unchanged ( and thus transform an orthonormal basis into another orthonormal basis ) but it will lead to a different gaussian ensemble of fluctuations .    a very simple example of such a transformation is to multiply all the electrical fields by a constant @xmath15 , while at the same time dividing the gauge potentials by the same constant ) is the complex version of a simplectic product .",
    "it is invariant under all the canonical transformations of the fields and their conjugate momenta , that form a superset of the unitary transformations ( where one would apply the same unitary rotation both to the gauge potentials and to the electrical fields ) . ] .",
    "obviously this transformation does not change the inner product defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : centralps ] ) , but it multiplies the variance of the set of gaussian fluctuations by @xmath25 for the electrical fields , and by @xmath26 for the gauge potentials . given the existence of these transformations , one can not be sure that the set of mode functions obtained in @xcite leads to the correct fluctuations .",
    "instead , they should be constructed by evolving the plane waves from @xmath13 .    in the present paper ,",
    "we reconsider this question by going back to the original definition of the 2-point function that controls the gaussian spectrum of fluctuations , i.e. the eq .",
    "( [ eq : fluct000 ] ) . using a gauge fixing inspired from ref .",
    "@xcite , we explicitly solve the linearized yang - mills equations over the leading order classical background field , with plane waves as the initial condition in the remote past .",
    "we obtain rather simple analytical expressions for these solutions , at a proper small positive time @xmath27 ( i.e. just after the collision ) .",
    "we provide the results in the fock - schwinger gauge that is commonly employed in the numerical resolution of the yang - mills equations , for a choice of quantum numbers which is appropriate for a numerical implementation on a lattice with a fixed spacing in the rapidity @xmath18 ( as opposed to a discretization with a fixed spacing in the longitudinal coordinate @xmath28 ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the section [ sec :",
    "background ] , we recall some well known results for the solution of the classical yang - mills equations in the presence of the two color currents that describe the colliding nuclei . most of the section is devoted to summarizing the derivation of this solution in the @xmath29 gauge , originally performed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and on the gauge transformation that one must perform in order to eventually obtain the result in the fock - schwinger gauge . in the section [ sec : fluct ] ,",
    "we follow a similar strategy in order to solve the linearized yang - mills equations for a small perturbation propagating over this background field .",
    "the calculation is subdivided in several stages , corresponding to the successive encounters of the fluctuation with the two nuclei , followed by a final gauge transformation to go from the @xmath29 gauge to the fock - schwinger gauge .",
    "the impatient reader may find the final result in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : finalresult ] ) .",
    "the section [ sec : concl ] is devoted to concluding remarks , and some more technical material is relegated into several appendices .",

    "as we shall see later , specific gauge choices may lead to some simplifications .    at leading order in the cgc framework ,",
    "inclusive observables can be expressed in terms of a gauge field that obeys the classical yang - mills equations , and that vanishes in the remote past ( i.e. before the collision )  : @xmath30=\\null & j^{\\nu}\\ ; , & \\left[{{\\mathcal{d}}}_\\mu , j^{\\mu}\\right]=\\null&0\\ ; , \\label{eq : ymlo}\\\\ \\lim\\limits_{t\\to-\\infty}{{\\mathcal{f}}}^{\\mu\\nu}=\\null&0\\ ; , & \\lim\\limits_{t\\to-\\infty}j^{\\nu}=\\null & \\delta^{\\nu-}\\rho_1 + \\delta^{\\nu+}\\rho_2\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] on the left are the equations obeyed by the gauge potential ( or equivalently the field strength @xmath31 ) , and on the right are the equations satisfied by the external current @xmath32 . in the remote past , it is given simply in terms of the two functions @xmath33 and @xmath34 that represent the color charge distribution in the two nuclei before the collision . however , since its conservation equation involves a covariant derivative , this current can be modified during the collision by the radiated gauge fields .",
    "this means that in general , one must view the eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ymlo ] ) as coupled equations .",
    "this problem has been solved long ago in @xcite .",
    "we just briefly remind the reader of the solution in the rest of this section , and we also discuss an alternate way of solving these equations that has been proposed in @xcite .    when extending the cgc to next - to - leading order , one needs to study small perturbations to the gauge field , more specifically those that behave as plane waves before the collision .",
    "because the gauge field is entangled with the current via the conservation equation , this in general leads to a small perturbation to the current as well carries a color .",
    "a quantum from this wave can be absorbed by one of the charges that contribute to the current @xmath35 , thereby altering its color , and therefore changing the current itself . ] .",
    "a linearization of the above equations around the lo solution gives  : @xmath36 -\\left[{{\\mathcal{d}}}^{\\nu},a^{\\mu}\\right]\\right ] -ig\\left[{{\\mathcal{f}}}^{\\nu\\mu},a_{\\mu}\\right]=\\null&j^{\\nu}\\ ; , & \\lim\\limits_{t\\to-\\infty}a^{\\mu}=\\null&\\epsilon^{\\mu } e^{ik\\cdot x}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath37-ig\\left[a_\\mu , j^{\\mu}\\right]=\\null&0\\ ; , & \\lim\\limits_{t\\to -\\infty}j^{\\nu}=\\null&0\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the change @xmath38 to the current must vanish in the remote past , since this is before the current could possibly have been altered by the plane wave .",
    "depending on the gauge choice , the bracket @xmath39 $ ] may vanish and therefore the perturbation of the current is identically @xmath40 .",
    "( but in the collision of two projectiles , the current has both non - vanishing @xmath41 and @xmath42 components , and none of the light - cone gauges can eliminate this term completely ) .      in the cgc description of heavy ion collisions ,",
    "the gauge fields are driven by two color currents @xmath43 and @xmath44 that describe the color carried by the fast partons of the two projectiles .",
    "these currents are proportional to delta distributions @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively . because of the presence of these singular sources in the classical yang - mills equations , one starts the numerical resolution of the field equations of motion slightly above the forward light - cone , at some small proper time @xmath24 .",
    "the evolution of the fields is thus free of these singular sources , but the drawback is that one must know the initial value of the gauge potentials and electrical fields at the starting time @xmath17 .    these initial conditions were first obtained in refs .",

    "a similar set of equations relates the field @xmath54 to the color current @xmath55 of the second nucleus .",
    "note that the @xmath56 dependence of @xmath57 is relevant only inside the support of the color currents .",
    "outside of these ( infinitesimal ) regions along the light - cones , the wilson lines @xmath58 depend only on the transverse coordinate @xmath19 .",
    "this is why in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mvfields ] ) , all the fields have only a transverse dependence .",

    "@xcite , the initial conditions ( [ eq : mvfields ] ) have been rederived by doing all the intermediate calculations in light - cone gauge , where crossing the light - cones that support the color currents can be handled more easily . since this is also the gauge choice that we will adopt for the intermediate steps of our calculation of the fluctuations , we reproduce the main steps of @xcite in the rest of this section , in order to outline its key features .      in the first derivation of the initial fields of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mvfields ] ) , different light - cone gauges were used for describing the two projectiles before they collide , by exploiting the fact that there is no causal contact between them until the collision .",
    "the main modification introduced in @xcite is to use a unique light - cone gauge , that is employed globally to treat the two projectiles . in this work",

    "this choice breaks the symmetry between the two nuclei . for the nucleus moving in the @xmath61 direction , the solution of the yang - mills equations in lorenz gauge",
    ", @xmath62 fulfills the light - cone gauge condition @xmath29 and therefore does not need to be transformed further .",
    "therefore , we just take @xmath63    this is not the case for the nucleus 1 , whose gauge potential in lorenz gauge has a non - zero minus component .",
    "we thus need to perform a gauge transformation , @xmath64 the gauge transformation @xmath65 has to be chosen so that it eliminates the minus component , and it turns out that it should be equal to the wilson line @xmath66 introduced earlier in eq .",

    "a legitimate question that arises is what is the advantage in treating the two nuclei in such an asymmetric fashion ?",
    "the reason is only technical : many calculations turn out to be simpler in this mixed description . in order to determine the fields just after the collision ( i.e. on the blue surface on the right side of figure ( [ fig : gauget ] ) ) , one can independently study what happens on its left and right branches .",

    "@xcite @xmath77 one sees that @xmath78 only depends on @xmath19 on the blue surface of figure ( [ fig : gauget ] ) , in the limit where this surface becomes infinitesimally close to the forward light - cone .",
    "note also that this solution is not quite symmetric between the nuclei 1 and 2 .",
    "indeed , @xmath79 is non zero , while @xmath80 is identically zero by virtue of the light - cone gauge condition .",
    "above the forward light - cone , analytical solutions of the classical yang - mills equations are not known , and one must resort to numerical techniques . in principle , it would be perfectly doable to solve the equations of motion in the gauge @xmath29 , starting with eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fieldslc ] ) as initial conditions .    however , above the forward light - cone",
    ", the natural coordinates to describe a high energy collision is the @xmath81 system .",
    "and consequently , the fock - schwinger gauge condition @xmath82 leads to simpler equations of motion than the light - cone gauge @xmath29 .",
    "it is therefore desirable to apply a gauge transformation to the fields of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fieldslc ] ) in order to satisfy the fock - schwinger gauge condition .",
    "this transformation can be done in two stages .",

    "we arrive at a more symmetric description of the collision , where both nuclei produce a transverse pure gauge field prior to the collision . when applied to the fields of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fieldslc ] ) , this transformation gives the following fields at @xmath47  : @xmath86 the first of eqs .",

    "one can therefore also rewrite it as a commutator , @xmath88\\ ; .\\ ] ] note that after this first stage , we are still in the light - cone gauge @xmath29 , but with a different choice of the residual gauge fixing compared to eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fieldslc ] ) . indeed ,",
    "since @xmath89 does not depend on @xmath74 , the gauge transformation generated by @xmath89 can not produce a non - zero @xmath90 .    as explained in @xcite , the final step to get",
    "the fock - schwinger gauge fields is to perform a gauge transform @xmath91 such that @xmath92 where the left hand side is the gauge potential of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fieldslc1 ] ) in light - cone gauge @xmath29 , and @xmath93 the gauge potential in fock - schwinger gauge .",
    "the @xmath94 component of these equations should therefore tell us how to choose @xmath91 in order to achieve the desired transformation . recalling that @xmath95 , and defining also @xmath96 , one then finds @xmath97 note that this formula is only valid for very small values of @xmath24 , since it has been obtained solely from the knowledge of the value of the gauge fields at @xmath47 .",
    "applying then this gauge transformation to the other components of the gauge potential , we recover the known results from @xcite , that we have already recalled in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mvfields ] ) .",
    "we now turn to the problem of computing analytically the small fluctuations @xmath22 on top of the background field , with plane wave initial conditions in the remote past .",
    "we will perform most of the calculation in the same @xmath29 light - cone gauge that was used in the previous section for the background field , and the gauge transformation to obtain finally the fluctuations in the fock - schwinger gauge will be performed at the very end .",
    "the setup of the problem in this gauge is illustrated in the figure [ fig : smallfluc ] , where we indicate the structure of the background field in each relevant region of space - time .    in this calculation",
    ", we will consider only the propagation of the fluctuations on the right part of the space - time diagram in the figure [ fig : smallfluc ] , i.e. waves that encounter first the nucleus 1 and next the nucleus 2 .",
    "naturally , there is a second contribution in which this sequence is reversed , but it is easy to guess it by symmetry at the end of the calculation .",
    "note that there is no possibility of cross - talk between these two contributions thanks to causality .",
    "this time evolution of a wave starting at @xmath13 can be divided in four steps , illustrated in the figure [ fig:4steps ]  :    * evolution in the region @xmath98 , before the fluctuation encounters any of the nuclei , * evolution across the trajectory of the first nucleus , * evolution in the region @xmath99 , between the two nuclei , * evolution across the trajectory of the second nucleus .",
