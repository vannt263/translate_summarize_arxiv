    "the rotation curves of high surface brightness ( hsb ) spiral galaxies rise fairly steeply to reach an extended , approximately flat part , well within the optical disk ( bosma 1978 , 1981a , b ; rubin , ford , & thonnard 1978 , 1980 ) . the discovery that the rotation curves of these galaxies are more or less flat out to one or two holmberg radii has been one of the key pieces of evidence for the existence of dark matter outside the optical disk ( see also van albada et al .  1985 ) . within the optical disk ,",
    "the observed rotation curves can in most cases be explained by the stellar components alone ( kalnajs 1983 ; kent 1986 ) .",
    "the rotation curves of so - called low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies have been studied only recently ( de blok , mcgaugh , & van der hulst 1996 , hereafter bmh ; see also pickering et al .",
    "these rotation curves , derived from  observations , were found to rise more slowly than those of hsb galaxies of the same luminosity , if the radii are measured in kpc . at the outermost measured point",
    ", they were often still rising .",
    "mcgaugh & de blok ( 1998 ) noted that , with radii expressed in disk scale lengths , the rotation curve shapes of lsb and hsb galaxies become more similar , but not necessarily identical .",
    "based on mass modeling of these  rotation curves , de blok & mcgaugh ( 1997 , hereafter bm ) concluded that lsb galaxies were dominated by dark matter and that the contribution of the stellar disk to the rotation curve , even if scaled to its maximum possible value , could not explain the observed rotation curve in the inner parts .",
    "the  rotation curves of lsb galaxies have received a great deal of attention , because they provide additional constraints on theories of galaxy formation and evolution , and dark halo structure ( e.g. , dalcanton , spergel , & summers 1997 ; mihos , mcgaugh , & de blok 1997 ; hernandez & gilmore 1998 ; kravtsov et al",
    ".  1998 ; mcgaugh & de blok 1998 ) .",
    "unfortunately , most of the galaxies studied in bmh and bm are only poorly resolved , making their results sensitive to the effects of beam smearing . for five of the galaxies in their sample ,",
    "high resolution h@xmath0 rotation curves , which have been obtained in order to eliminate beam smearing and to investigate the rotation curve shapes in the inner parts of lsb galaxies , are presented in this letter .",
    "the galaxies presented here were selected from the sample of lsb galaxies of bmh .",
    "only galaxies were chosen that satisfied the criteria given in bm to define their useful rotation curves .",
    "an overview of the properties of the galaxies is given in table  [ tabprops ] , which lists the name of the galaxy ( 1 ) , the adopted distance in mpc , for @xmath1 km s@xmath2 mpc@xmath2 ( 2 ) , the central surface brightness in mag arcsec@xmath3 ( 3 ) , the disk scale length in kpc ( 4 ) , the inclination angle ( 5 ) , the position angle ( 6 ) , the absolute magnitude ( 7 ) and the systemic velocity ( 8) .",
    "the observations were carried out at palomar observatory with the @xmath4 hale telescope telescope is operated in a joint agreement among the california institute of technology , the jet propulsion laboratory and cornell university ] , on november 20 1998 .",
    "the fwhm velocity resolution was 54 km s@xmath2 , the pixel size in the spatial direction was @xmath5 .",
    "each galaxy spectrum consisted of a single 1800s exposure .",
    "the slit was oriented along the major axis , at the position angle derived by bmh ( see table  [ tabprops ] ) . despite their low surface brightnesses",
    ", all galaxies showed up clearly on the slit - viewing monitor .",
    "the slit could therefore accurately be aligned with the center of the galaxy by eye .",

    "to derive the rotation curves , we started by making gaussian fits to the line profiles at each position along the major axis to obtain the radial velocities . these fits and their errors",
    "are overlayed on the h@xmath0 position - velocity diagram in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "the positions of the galaxy centers were determined from the peak of the continuum light along the slit .",
    "all galaxies were suffi-    ciently bright to allow to determine the position of the center along the slit with an accuracy of better than @xmath26 .",
    "= 18.5 cm -0.0 cm    to obtain a larger radial coverage of the rotation curves , the h@xmath0 data were combined with the  data presented in bmh . to this end",
    ", the derived h@xmath0 velocities were plotted on the position - velocity diagrams .",
    "both sets of data were found to agree well with each other if the effects of beam smearing on the  data are taken into account ( cf .",
    "swaters 1999 ) .",
    "therefore , we have used the  data to determine rotation velocities beyond radii where we found h@xmath0 emission . note that in most cases the  extends only little beyond the h@xmath0 .",
    "next , the rotation curves derived for the approaching and the receding sides were combined .",
    "the h@xmath0 points were sampled every @xmath27 , the  points every @xmath28 ( approximately two points per beam ) . the errors on the rotation velocities were estimated from the differences between the two sides and the uncertainties in the derived velocities .",
    "we will refer to these rotation curves as the high resolution rotation curves ( hrc ) .",
    "the derived hrcs are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] together with the rotation curves presented in bm .",
    "probably because bm did not correct for beam smearing , the  rotation curves systematically underestimate the inner slopes of the rotation curves , especially for f568-v1 and f574 - 1 .",
    "both these galaxies have a central depression in the distribution , as can be seen in the  maps presented in bmh .",
    "the spatial smearing of  from larger radii into the observed central depression leads to an apparent solid body - like rotation curve , in particular for the highly inclined galaxy f574 - 1 .",
    "for the mass modeling presented here we have used the same parameters for the thickness of the gaseous and stellar disks as bm have done .",
    "the stellar disk was assumed to have a vertical sech@xmath29 distribution , with a scale height @xmath30 .",
    "@xmath31-band light profiles , presented in de blok , van der hulst , & bothun ( 1995 ) and bmh , were used to calculate the contribution of the stellar disk to the rotation curve .",
    "the was assumed to reside in an infinitely thin disk .",
    "the only difference with the mass models presented in bm is that we have decomposed the light profile of f568 - 1 into a disk and a central component , and fitted these components to the rotation curve separately . in the other galaxies",
    "no significant central component is present . for the dark matter component",
    "a pseudo - isothermal halo was used , following bm , which has a rotation curve given by : @xmath32,\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the halo core radius and @xmath34 is the central density .",
    "one of the major uncertainties in fitting mass models to rotation curves , in absence of an independent measurement of the stellar mass - to - light ratio @xmath35 , is the uncertainty in the contribution of the stellar disk to the rotation curve .",
    "however , lower and upper limits on @xmath35 , and hence on the dark matter content , can be obtained by assuming that the contribution of the stellar disk to the rotation curve is either minimal or maximal .    in the maximum disk mass models ,",
    "the contribution of the stellar disk to the rotation curve is scaled to explain most of the inner parts of the rotation curve .",
    "the resulting rotation curve fits are shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] .",
    "what immediately strikes the eye is that , in contrast with the findings of bm , the    -17pt table 2 + mass model parameters    lccccccc & & & & & & & & lsbc & & @xmath35 & @xmath33 & @xmath34 & & @xmath33 & @xmath34 name & & m@xmath36 & kpc & @xmath37 & & kpc & @xmath38 f563-v2@xmath6 & & 5.4 & & & & 0.94 & 0.283 f568 - 1@xmath39 & & 17.2 & & & & 1.5 & 0.181 f568 - 3 & & 1.5 & 3.0 & 0.027 & & 2.5 & 0.48 f568-v1 & & 9.3 & 6.7 & 0.005 & & 1.2 & 0.188 f574 - 1 & & 3.7 & 3.4 & 0.003 & & 1.5 & 0.92    inner parts of the rotation curves can be explained almost entirely by the contribution of the stellar disk in all of these lsb galaxies , with the exception of f568 - 3 .",
    "the dark halo parameters ( see table  [ tabfits ] ) are ill - defined for most galaxies in our sample , because most of the hrcs do not extend to large radii .",
    "nonetheless , it is clear that in these maximum disk fits the contribution of the dark halo will only become important outside the optical disk , as is also the case for hsb galaxies .",
    "the required stellar mass - to - light ratios for the maximum disk fits ( listed in table  [ tabfits ] ) , may be high , up to 17 in the @xmath31-band .",
    "most of these are well outside the range of what current population synthesis models predict ( e.g. , worthey 1994 ) . if these high values of @xmath35  are to be explained solely by a stellar population , the stellar content and the processes of star formation in lsb galaxies need to be very different from those in hsb galaxies .",
    "alternatively , these high mass - to - light ratios may indicate the presence of an additional baryonic component that is associated with the disk , as has been suggested by e.g.  pfenniger , combes , & martinet ( 1994 ) . on the other hand , the fact that stellar disk can be scaled to explain the observed rotation curve may simply reflect the possibility that the luminous and dark mass have a similar distribution within the optical galaxy .",
    "the other extreme for the contribution of the stellar disk to the rotation curve is to assume that its contribution is negligible .",
    "the dark halo parameters for this minimum disk fit are listed in table  [ tabfits ] .",
    "high central densities of dark matter and small core radii are required to explain the observed steep rise in the hrcs . from fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] it is clear that the minimum disk mass models fit the rotation curves equally well as the maximum disk models . in fact , a good fit can be obtained with any mass - to - light ratio lower than the maximum disk mass - to - light ratio , demonstrating that the degeneracy that exists in the mass modeling for hsb galaxies ( e.g.  van albada et al .",
    "1985 ) also exists for lsb galaxies .",
    "irrespective of the contribution of the stellar disk to the rotation curve , the similarity between the shapes of the observed rotation curves and those of the stellar disks implies that the total mass density and the luminous mass density are coupled within the region of the optical disk .",
    "the hrcs derived for the lsb galaxies rise steeply in the inner parts , and reach a flat part beyond about two disk scale lengths , as is found for hsb galaxies . in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] , the rotation curves for lsb galaxies ( dotted lines ) are compared with those of three typical late - type hsb galaxies from begeman ( 1987 ) , ngc  2403 , ngc  3198 and ngc  6503 .",
    "all the galaxies in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] have no bulges , or only weak ones . in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] the radii are given in kpc .",
    "in these units , the rotation curves of lsb galaxies rise more slowly than those of hsb galaxies , indicating that these galaxies not only have lower central surface brightnesses , but also lower central mass densities , as was found by de blok & mcgaugh ( 1996 ) as well .",
    "a different picture emerges in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] , in which the rotation curves are scaled by their optical disk scale lengths and normalized to the velocity at two disk scale lengths .",
    "the normalization probably does not introduce systematic effects because the maximum difference in absolute magnitude between the galaxies in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] is only 1.5 mag .",
    "with radii expressed in disk scale lengths , the rotation curves of the lsb galaxies presented here and those of hsb galaxies have almost identical shapes .",
    "this is consistent with the concept of a ` universal rotation curve ' ( persic , salucci , & stel 1996 , see also rubin et al .  1985 ) .",
    "the similarity between the lsb and hsb rotation curve shapes suggests that rotation curve shapes are linked to the distribution of light in the stellar disks , independent of central disk surface brightness .",
    "although such a link is most easily understood if the stellar disks are close to maximal , independent of surface brightness , the required high mass - to - light ratios seem to favor a picture in which lsb galaxies are dominated by dark matter within the optical disk , and hsb galaxies more by the stellar disk .",
    "the relative contribution of the stellar disk to the rotation curve may change continuously from lsb to hsb , or perhaps lsb and hsb galaxies constitute discrete galaxy families , as has been suggested by tully & verheijen ( 1997 ) .",
