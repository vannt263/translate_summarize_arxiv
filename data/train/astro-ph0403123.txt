    "undoubtedly , gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) have remained to be one of the most exiting , intriguing , and enigmatic astrophysical phenomena since their mysterious discovery in the past several decades ( for a recent expository review of grbs the interested reader is referred to the excellent work by j. i. katz @xcite ) .",
    "although no two grbs resemble each other and each one has its own peculiarities which makes the problem of modeling grbs very difficult , the whole of grbs reveals several interesting features .",
    "since the publication of the batse data @xcite which included the observation of over @xmath4 grbs and revealed an almost uniform distribution of the location of grbs in the sky , combined with the deficiency of faint grbs , the association of grbs with the galactic plane has been ruled out .",
    "the successive publications confirmed the figure more and more @xcite .",
    "however , since the observation of afterglows in x - ray @xcite , optical @xcite and radio spectrum @xcite and the advert of robotic optical transient search experiment ( rotsie ) telescope ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) which has revealed the red shifts for several grbs , their cosmological origin is widely accepted .",
    "+ the batse data @xcite has also revealed another equally important overall feature of the grbs .",
    "the distribution of time duration in observed grbs shows a double heap distribution , which the smaller one peaks around 0.2 sec and the larger one peaks around 20 sec ( fig.1 ) .",
    "this two peaked distribution which apparently separated grbs into the so called short duration and long duration ones was referred to as @xmath5 @xcite and led some investigators to believe that there are two distinct populations of grbs .",
    "+ it has been widely believed that whatever the central engine is , the radiation reaching us originates from the space surrounding the central engine .",
    "it is also believed that during the collapse the energy release streams out in relativistic confined ejectas ( not isotropically ) and thus the total energy release during each event is far less than the unbelievable amount that one might obtain by assuming isotropic radiation @xcite .",
    "+ the aim of this paper is to present a rather simple model , based on these general ideas , and show that there is no need for assuming two distinct populations of grbs , and to show that once the geometrical considerations and cosmological effects are fully accounted for a genetic standard candle ejecta , crossing an amorphous dense cloud , the so called @xmath5 can be deduced . + in ",
    "2 the model and its general formulation is introduced . in ",
    "3 the computational results and the fit of model parameters with batse data will be presented as well .   4",
    "is devoted to a discussion on the results .",
    "some needed calculations and discussions are presented in appendices .",
    "grbs are modeled as a central engine with an instantaneous ultra - relativistic jet of material surrounded by an amorphous dense cloud . the central engine and its jet",
    "are taken as a standard candle with a total release energy of @xmath6 , and an initial lorentz factor @xmath7 and initial opening angle @xmath8 of the jet for all grbs , whereas the clouds are considered to have a distribution both in thickness as well as in density .",
    "for the sake of illustration and brevity we take both of these distributions to be gaussian .",
    "+ we want to calculate the distribution of logarithm of time duration of observed grbs according to the above model .",
    "we should however explore the ejecta evolution since the observed gamma ray emission originates in the shock front of ejecta+shocked medium .",
    "the equations describing the ejecta evolution are presented here , based on the notations of paczynski & rhoads @xcite .",
    "we consider the cloud to be at a distance @xmath9 from the source , which may be negligible in comparison to the cloud thickness @xmath10 .",
    "the ratio of swept - up mass to ejecta mass @xmath11 has the form below : @xmath12 where , @xmath13 is the ejecta distance from the source .",
    "the cloud density @xmath14 is taken to be independent of @xmath13 . furthermore , @xmath15 $ ] , in which @xmath16 represents the opening angle of the ejecta at radius @xmath13 .",

    "we begin with introducing the probability density for a collimated burst to occur in a direction through the cloud with a thickness @xmath10 and a number density @xmath19 .",
    "we assume the cloud thickness to have a gaussian distribution in various directions from the central engine . by assuming a gaussian distribution for the cloud density as well we have : @xmath41\\:\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma_{_{l } } } \\:\\exp\\left[\\frac{-(l-\\overline{l})^{2}}{2\\sigma_{_{l}}^{2}}\\right]~.\\ ] ] the quantities @xmath42 and @xmath43 denote the mean thickness of the cloud and its dispersion , respectively .",
    "likewise , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are defined in a similar manner . denoting the angle between the ejecta symmetry axis and the line of sight by @xmath46 ( fig.2 ) , and considering the independence of the probability density from azimuth angle in equation(13 ) ,",
    "we can write : @xmath47\\:\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}\\sigma_{_{l } } } \\:\\exp\\left[\\frac{-(l-\\overline{l})^{2}}{2\\sigma_{_{l}}^{2}}\\right]~.\\ ] ] the synchrotron emission is a fast process for our model ( see appendix a ) , so @xmath48 ( the time duration of a grb as measured by an observer cosmologicaly near to the source and located on the line of sight ) , is attributed to the time that the shock front takes to cross the dense cloud . as explained in appendix c",
    ", the cloud thickness @xmath10 can be expressed as a function of @xmath46 , @xmath19 , and @xmath48 ( eqn.[c16 ] ) : @xmath49 so we write : @xmath50 or : @xmath51 notifying that by this substitution(eqn.[15 ] ) , the bursts that do not manage to cross through the cloud with a thickness @xmath10 ( and stop in it ) are practically omitted ( see appendix c ) . using equation(14 ) in equation(17 ) , it is seen that : @xmath52 \\exp\\left[\\frac{-(l(t_{rec},n,\\theta)-\\overline{l})^{2}}{2\\sigma_{_{l}}^{2}}\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] integrating over @xmath46 and @xmath19 yields : @xmath53 \\exp\\left[\\frac{-(l(t_{rec},n,\\theta)-\\overline{l})^{2}}{2\\sigma_{_{l}}^{2}}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times&\\left(\\frac{dl}{d\\log t_{rec}}\\right)_{_{n,\\theta}}\\sin\\theta\\:d\\theta\\:dn~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the effect of red shift is not considered yet .",
    "equation(19 ) only gives the probability density for an observed burst to have a specified logarithm of time duration , as measured by an observer near to it .",
    "we now investigate the relation between @xmath54 and @xmath55 where @xmath56 stands for the time duration of a grb measured at earth .",
    "to obtain the later , the former must be integrated over red shift z , using a weight function @xmath57 , so that @xmath58 represents the probability for occurring a grb in a red shift between @xmath59 and @xmath60 . to show this ,",
    "let s consider an observer located on the line from us to an occurred grb which is ( cosmologicaly ) near to it .",
    "the probability density for the grb to occur in a red shift z ( with respect to us ) , and to have a specific @xmath61 ( measured by the observer near to the grb ) , is clearly as below : @xmath62 to obtain @xmath63 , which is the probability density for observing a grb occurred at a red shift z and observed to have a specific @xmath56 , we write : @xmath64~,\\ ] ] noting that @xmath65 , the second term in the the bracket equals one .",
    "now , using equation(20 ) we have : @xmath66 after integrating equation(22 ) over z , the final form of the observable probability density will be as below : @xmath67 the explicit form of @xmath57 is needed .",
    "this form is obtained in appendix d ( eqn.[d4 ] and eqn.[d5 ] ) .",
    "the second term in the integrand is given by equation(19 ) , in which the implicit form of @xmath68 appears .",
    "appendix c is devoted to the procedure of obtaining this function . for evaluation of @xmath69 ( eqn.[23 ] ) ,",
    "we need the values of eight parameters .",
    "four of them are the cloud parameters @xmath42 , @xmath70 , @xmath44 , and @xmath71 , and the fifth one is the index @xmath72 corresponding to the grb occurrence rate ( see eqn.[d5 ] ) .",
    "the later three ones are the ejecta parameters , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , which are the initial kinetic energy , the initial lorentz factor , and the initial opening angle of the ejecta , respectively .",
    "the @xmath73 software is used in the numerical computations . in the procedure",
    "we begin with solving the coupled differential equations(7 ) and ( 11 ) which govern the ejecta evolution , and in which @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the only free parameters . furthermore , we take @xmath74 . for fixed values of these parameters ,",
    "the functions @xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( see eqn.[c3 ] ) can be uniquely obtained .",
    "obviously @xmath22 decreases with increasing @xmath32 ( fig.3 ) , and reaches to @xmath78 when @xmath32 approaches a certain value .",
    "this in fact takes an infinite time and results in an infinite non - dimensional time duration @xmath79 ( see eqn.[c4 ] and eqn.[c5 ] ) .",
    "so , to circumvent the difficulty , we consider an effective lower limit @xmath80 for the lorentz factor of shocked matter , which yields an effective upper limit for non - dimensional time @xmath39 .",
    "we adopted @xmath81 as a lower cut - off .",
    "then , following the procedure explained in appendix c , for a specific cloud thickness @xmath10 , and correspondingly a specific @xmath82 ( eqn.[c13 ] ) , the non - dimensional time duration @xmath83 of a grb can be calculated for every @xmath46 and @xmath82 ( fig.4 ) .",
    "let s denote the radius corresponding to @xmath80 by @xmath84 so that @xmath85 , and recall that in the model , for @xmath86 , the emitted photons would be completely scattered by the electrons of not - swept part of the cloud ( that they have to pass through , before entering free space ; see appendix c ) , and so , the whole phenomenon may be called a `` @xmath87 '' .",
    "but , if @xmath88 , the shocked matter succeeds to go out of the cloud and , as explained in   4.3 , due to a suppression process that intensively decreases the cross - section of compton scattering,(the major part",
    "of)the emitted photons finally succeed to get released from the shocked medium and enter free space , provided that @xmath89^{-1}$ ] ( see appendix b ) .",
    "it is really for this reason that @xmath79 happens to be a function of @xmath82 , and practically independent of @xmath84 .",
    "then , solving @xmath83 for @xmath82 numerically , we can obtain the function @xmath90 which is the equivalent non - dimensional form of expression ( 15 ) .",
    "we rewrite equation(19 ) in a non - dimensional form suitable for numerical computations : @xmath91 \\exp\\left[\\frac{-\\left(\\frac{l(\\overline{n}\\nu / e)}{\\overline{l}}\\eta_{_{l}}(\\tau_{rec},\\theta)-1\\right)^{2}}{2\\varsigma^{2}}\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times&\\frac{l(\\overline{n}\\nu / e)}{\\overline{l}}\\left(\\frac{d\\eta_{_{l}}}{d\\log \\tau_{rec}}\\right)_{_{\\nu,\\theta}}\\sin\\theta\\:d\\theta\\:d\\nu,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in which , equation(c13 ) and the definitions below : + @xmath92  , + @xmath93  , + and + @xmath94 + are used .",
    "so , after choosing the quantities @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath71 , and of course @xmath6 , we can evaluate the integral appearing in equation(24 ) . then , after choosing a value for @xmath72 , the integral of equation(23 ) can be performed to obtain the observable quantity @xmath95 . + as seen in equation(24 ) , the initial kinetic energy @xmath6 and the cloud mean density @xmath44 appear only in the form @xmath96 , and therefore they can not be found separately in a fitting process , and all that can be obtained is only their ratio .",
    "but , the observed fluence of grbs reveals that the released energy in grbs is of order of @xmath97 for a isotropic burst , which reduces to @xmath98 if the bursts were confined to a cone with a solid angle @xmath99 .",
    "we used this amount of isotropic energy to relate @xmath6 to @xmath8 ( @xmath100 ) , and reduce the free parameters of the model to seven as @xmath101 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , which hereafter are called @xmath102 parameters .",
    "these parameters must be chosen so that the results make the best fitting to the observed distribution of grbs . to achieve the task",
    ", one must search in the seven dimensional @xmath102 space , and find the point in which the statistical quantity @xmath103 takes the smallest value @xmath104 .",
    "we used the batse 4th catalogue @xcite of 1234 grbs and adopted the bins @xmath105 in a range @xmath106 , and used the @xmath107 technique to move toward the best point in which @xmath103 gets minimized .",
    "the obtained fitted values are : @xmath108 with a corresponding value @xmath109 ( per degree of freedom ) .",
    "as can be seen in fig.5 , the deviation from a more perfect coincidence to data seems for the structure in the observed distribution located around @xmath110 .",
    "the structure has been noted before @xcite .",
    "we put aside the the data of the noted structure , which are ones with durations between @xmath111 , and again repeated the numerical searching process in the parametric space .",
    "the new obtained values of the fitted parameters are : + @xmath112 which slightly differ from what previously obtained ( eqn.[25 ] ) . but",
    "this time , @xmath104 reduces to @xmath113 ( fig.6 ) .",
    "so the mentioned structure may be interpreted as a result of an independent phenomenon or effect which was not considered in our model .",
    "though the original shapes of equations ( 13 ) and ( 14 ) are naturally normalized , the resulting final equations ( 19 ) and ( 23 ) are not , because : + 1)the bursts that their symmetry axes make an angle @xmath114 can not be detected ( see appendix c ) , + 2)the bursts for which @xmath86 were not considered in the numerical computations ( because they do not manage to cross out the cloud ) . + the total probability of observing the occurred bursts , @xmath115 , is obtained to be @xmath116 , using our best fit parameters(eqn.[26 ] ) .",
    "this small probability must be interpreted to be due to the above two reasons .",
    "the first reason describes the suppression of observed grbs by the term @xmath117 , while the second is responsible for the remaining factor of @xmath118 .",
    "so , only about one percent of the bursts manage to produce a real grb , and only about @xmath119 of these grbs occur in our line of sight . of course",
    ", the lateral spreading of the ejecta+swept mass may modify these two factors , increasing the first and decreasing the second .",
    "+ with the values for the fitted parameters in equation(25 ) or in equation(26 ) , the mean mass of the clouds @xmath120 is about @xmath121 , which is of the order of the envelop mass in massive stars .",
    "such amorphous clouds seem strange in stars , but in close neutron star - supergiant binaries where the neutron star orbits around the core and accrete the envelope , the spherical symmetry is likely removed , as pointed out by podsiadlowski et al .",
    "terman , taam , & hernquist @xcite show that the system would emerge to form a red supergiant with a massive thorne - zytkow object ( tzo ) @xcite .",
    "podsiadlowski et al .",
    "@xcite also estimated a tzo birth - rate of @xmath122 in the galaxy . considering equation(d4 ) and the obtained total probability of observing a `` real '' grb , which is @xmath123 in our model ( see above ) , it is seen that the grb observation rate ( @xmath124 events per day ) implies a total ( real+failed ) grb rate of the order of @xmath125 .",
    "this is not too far from what podsiadlowski et al .",
    "@xcite theoretically estimated for tzo birth - rate ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "qin et al .",
    "@xcite introduced aicns ( accretion - induced collapse of neutron stars ) scenario as grb engines .",
    "katz @xcite introduces a dense cloud model to explain the observed @xmath127 gamma - rays in a number of grbs ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) , and suggests the amorphous envelops of tzos for these clouds .",
    "+ the initial opening angle of the ejecta in our model ( @xmath128 ) is obtained during the fitting process (   3 ) .",
    "such a small opening angle for an ejecta or a jet might be explained by attributing it to the collimating process of an ultra - relativistic ejecta with @xmath129 in a sufficiently high magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the initial lorentz factor of the ejecta , as obtained in our model ( @xmath130 , see eqn.[25 ] ) provides the necessary condition of @xmath129 . aside from these theoretical justifications for the idea of a highly collimated ejecta at the source",
    ", there are some pieces of evidences supporting this idea @xcite .      at the mean time the observed bimodality must be interpreted as a result of the second reason expressed in   4.1 .",
    "though in our model one may expect only one heap in the @xmath131 distribution associated with the directions in the clouds having both the most probable @xmath10 and @xmath19 ( which are equal or near to @xmath42 and @xmath44 ) , but as the numerical computation shows , such directions in the clouds are too thick and too dense to be crossed out by the ejecta , and therefore a real grb would not be produced .",
    "so , we are left with four other regions with high probabilities : + 1 ) @xmath132 and @xmath133 ( short grbs ) + 2 ) @xmath132 and @xmath134 ( no grbs ) + 3 ) @xmath135 and @xmath136 ( no grbs ) + 4 ) @xmath137 and @xmath136 ( long grbs ) + now , we show that the directions trough the clouds associated with region(1 ) produce the short duration grbs , and ones associated to regions ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) produce no grb , while the others in the forth region produce the long duration ones .",
    "+ as to the equation(9 ) the quantity @xmath138 ( which is of the order of the sedov length ) is @xmath139 for @xmath140 ( see eqn.[25 ] ) . as seen in fig.7 ,",
    "the time duration of grbs associated to such directions is of the order of the time duration of short grbs ( case ( 1 ) above ) .",
    "fig.8 shows that in our model the calculated time duration of grbs for @xmath141 is of the order of the duration of long grbs . using equation(9 )",
    ", we see that in this case ( @xmath141 ) , @xmath138 is about @xmath142 .",
    "so in our model the long duration grbs are due to the passing of ejecta through the directions where @xmath143 and @xmath144 ( case ( 4 ) above ) .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath145 when @xmath132 , we see that in cases ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) above , the ejecta would stop in the dense cloud and the produced photons can not scape from the optically thick cloud . in fig.9 ,",
    "@xmath146 is plotted for a number of densities , when @xmath147 has the highest permitted value @xmath84 .",
    "+ these general features of our calculations result from the general features of our model , and therefore we speculate that any distributions for the clouds thickness and density which are picked around a mean value could explain the general features of the duration distribution .",
    "our chose of gaussian distributions for thickness and density was only for the few parameters needed to describe them .",
    "+      in `` the dense cloud model '' at this stage we have simply omitted the bursts which ejectas can not go out of the cloud and stop in it ( because the emitted photons would be scattered by the dense cloud ) , and we have claimed that the produced photons by all bursts that succeed to cross out the dense cloud can finally enter the free space .",
    "+ at the first glance the model might appear to have a serious problem in opacity , namely , in this model the best fit mean density and mean thickness of the clouds are found to be of the orders of @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "so , as to the relation @xmath150 , ( @xmath151 ) one would expect an optical depth of the order of @xmath152 .",
    "but there are two factors that remedy the situation : + ( i ) as the numerical calculation shows ( see   4.2 ) , the most probable directions characterized by @xmath132 and @xmath136 are dynamically too thick to be crossed out by the ejecta and the radiation produced in this case would be completely scattered by the dense cloud . on the other hand , as discussed in",
    "  4.2 , the long duration grbs are due to the crossing of ejecta through directions where @xmath153 and @xmath136 .",
    "since the density is reduced by the factor @xmath154 , the optical depth drops to the order of @xmath155 . as explained in   4.2 , the short duration grbs are due to the directions in the cloud where @xmath132 and @xmath156 . in this case",
    "the optical depth of the cloud reduces to @xmath157 , which is yet too high .",
    "but , + ( ii ) most of photons emitted off the shock front have the chance to be overtaken by the moving shock ( appendix b ) .",
    "moreover , it has been shown @xcite that in high temperatures @xmath158 the cross section of compton scattering for instance for @xmath159 photons effectively drops to @xmath160 , so such a high temperature plasma is much more transparent than what may seem at first .",
    "the same is true for the case of a power law distribution of electrons ( see eqn.[a4 ] ) .",
    "most of the electrons in such a distribution have energies of the order of @xmath161 , in which we have used equation(a5 ) , taking @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 . for this case",
    "the compton cross section suppresses by the factor of @xmath165 for @xmath166 photons ( the energy of the emitted photons in the shocked medium comoving frame is less than their observed energy by the factor of @xmath22 ) , and therefore , the optical depth drops to the order of @xmath155 .",
    "so the photons overtaken by the shocked medium may remain in it without being scattered until the shocked medium crosses up the dense cloud .",
    "briefly , due to this second factor , the optical depth in short duration case diminishes to @xmath167 , and the optical depth in long duration case diminishes to @xmath168 .",
    "+ the variability seen in the light curves of long duration grbs maybe attributed to the heterogeny of cloud s density in the ejecta s trajectory .",
    "this maybe the case in long duration grbs for which @xmath168 , but in short duration grbs for which @xmath167 , we expect that such a heterogeny would not be appeared .",
    "+ the lateral expansion of the shocked medium can reduce its density and therefore its optical depth .",
    "this effect of course may cool the shocked medium and cause an increase in effective compton cross section in it .",
    "the consideration of dynamical feedback makes our modeling much more complicated and it has been neglected here . in `` the dense cloud model '' at this stage we have simply omitted the bursts which ejectas can not go out of the cloud and stop in it , but have claimed that the produced photons by all bursts that succeed to cross out the dense cloud can finally enter free space . +",
    "a complete study needs to include flux computations .",
    "an exact comparison with observed time duration data would be possible only when the theoretical time duration appearing in this work were exactly evaluated in the same manner as the observable duration @xmath169 is defined ( as the time interval over which @xmath170 percent to @xmath171 percent of the burst counts accumulate ) .",
    "moreover , the batse s triggering mechanism made it less sensitive to short grbs than to long ones and therefore short grbs were detected to smaller distances @xcite , so a smaller number of them have been observed .",
    "lee & petrosian @xcite studied this effect and corrected the number of short grbs . in a more exact work this correction must be considered too .",

    "in this part we use the review paper of piran ( 1999 ) to estimate the synchrotron cooling time in our model .",
    "the synchrotron cooling time in the comoving frame is : @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the thompson cross section and @xmath174 is the lorentz factor of the emitting electron , while @xmath175 stands for the energy density of magnetic field which in grb literature is assumed to be proportional to @xmath176 , the comoving internal energy density of the shocked matter : @xmath177 so that @xmath178 represents the share of magnetic field in @xmath176 , which is given by : @xmath179 in which , @xmath19 is the number density of surrounding medium ( ism , or a dense cloud as assumed in our model ) , and @xmath22 denotes the lorentz factor of the shocked matter .",
    "+ the electrons in shocked media are assumed to develop a power law distribution of lorentz factors : @xmath180 the convergence of total energy of the electrons requires the power index @xmath181 to be greater than @xmath124 , while the assumed lower limit @xmath182 is to prevent the divergence of electron number density and is obtained to be : @xmath183 where @xmath184 represents the share of the electrons in the internal energy of shocked matter .",
    "+ furthermore , the time interval between emission of two photons from the same point in the comoving frame , @xmath185 , and the time interval @xmath186 , which represents the time interval of their successive arrival to a cosmologically distant observer ( at the earth ) , are related as below : @xmath187 equations(a1-a6 ) are adopted from piran ( 1999 ) .",
    "now , by substituting equations(a2),(a3 ) , & ( a5 ) in equation(a1 ) , and then using equation(a6 ) , the synchrotron cooling time measured by a terrestrial observer turns out to be : @xmath188 which is clearly much less than all observed time durations of grbs .",
    "so , the synchrotron emission in a dense cloud model must be considered as an instantaneous process , and therefore the shock front must be regarded as the emitting surface .",
    "this allows us to attribute time duration of a grb merely to the time that the shock front takes to cross the dense cloud .",

    "correspond to shocked matter and shock front speeds , both measured in the ( central ) source frame . in the shocked matter frame ( fig.11 ) the dense cloud which is seen to have a density @xmath192 , moves toward the shocked medium with a speed @xmath190 , while being compressed to a density equal to @xmath193 .",
    "consequently , as illustrated in fig.11 , the shocked medium expands towards right with a speed @xmath194 which is in fact the speed of the shock front in the shocked matter frame ( compare fig.10 and fig.11 ) .",
    "considering the conservation of nucleon number , it is seen that : @xmath195 considering the relativistic summation of velocities , we have : @xmath196 noting the relations @xmath197 and @xmath198 , the substitution of equation(b1 ) in equation(b2 ) finally yields : @xmath199 the distance from the origin to the shock front , denoted by @xmath200 , can be obtained by integrating @xmath191 over @xmath201 : @xmath202 the results are shown in fig.12 . as seen , the difference between @xmath13 and @xmath200 never exceeds one percent . this result justifies the use of symbol @xmath13 ( instead of @xmath203 ) for the location of the shock front through out our formulation .",
    "+ now , let s consider a photon that is radiated from the shock front ( the emitting surface ) moving with the lorentz factor @xmath204 ( eqn.[b3 ] ) , in a direction which makes an angle @xmath205 with the velocity vector of the shocked matter ( fig.10 ) . if : @xmath206 the photon would be overtaken by the shock front .",
    "the majority of the emitted photons fulfill this condition when @xmath207 and @xmath208 ( see eqn.[25 ] ) .",
    "here the effect of burster geometry on the observed time duration is investigated . at first , as shown in fig.13 , we consider a radiating segment on the shock front .",
    "the symmetry axis is denoted by @xmath209 . noting the definition of @xmath205 in the figure , it is seen that in addition to a radial component @xmath210 , the velocity vector of the segment must have a lateral component @xmath211 which is equal to : @xmath212 as measured in the source frame . in equation(c1 ) the non - dimensional radius @xmath32 , as defined in equation(8 ) , is used instead of @xmath13 , .",
    "equation(c1 ) is obtained simply by using equation(5 ) and assuming that the lateral speed of the segment in a frame moving ( only radially and ) instantaneously along with the segment , is the fraction @xmath213 of sound speed @xmath24 ( which is the lateral speed of the emitting surface at its edges ) , and noting that the lateral speed in the source frame is less than its corresponding value in the ( radially instantaneous ) comoving frame by the factor @xmath214 .",
    "it is well known that the radiation emitted by the segment is almost confined to an angle @xmath214 . in fig.13 the axis of the radiation cone emitted by the segment",
    "is denoted by @xmath215 , which is parallel to the velocity vector of the segment and , as seen in the figure , makes an angle @xmath216 with @xmath217 axis , where @xmath218 $ ] .",
    "so the radiation angle @xmath219 ( as depicted in the figure ) can be written as below : @xmath220 and the total radiation angle , defined as the radiation angle at the edge of the emitting surface , can be written as : @xmath221 this angle represents the cone of space illuminated by the emitting surface . using the results of equation(7 ) , the total radiation angle can be evaluated for every `` @xmath32 '' .",
    "having defined the total radiation angle , we explore the effect of burster geometry on its observed time duration @xmath56 .",
    "as shown in fig.2 , the problem is studied in a spherical coordinate system in which the central engine is taken as the origin , and the line - of - sight as the polar axis @xmath59 .",
    "consider a photon emitted off a point on the emitting surface ( the shock front ) with radial coordinate @xmath13 and polar coordinate @xmath222 ; and at an instance t , measured in the source frame ( the point is not shown in the figure ) .",
    "the relation between @xmath201 and the photon arrival time @xmath223 to a ( cosmologically ) near observer is obtained by granot , piran , & sari @xcite .",
    "making suitable for our model , it is adjusted to the form below : @xmath224 in this equation the instance @xmath225 is defined as the time that the ejecta collides with the dense cloud at @xmath226 ; while @xmath227 is the time that the ( cosmologically ) near observer receives the photon emitted at @xmath225 from the point with coordinates @xmath226 and @xmath228 . defining : @xmath229 and noting equation(8 ) and equation(12 ) , we rewrite equation(c4 ) in the form below : @xmath230 multiplying equation(c4 ) by the cosmological time dilation term @xmath231 , results in the arrival time as maybe observed at the earth : @xmath232 or equivalently : @xmath233 in which we used the non - dimensional time duration @xmath234 defined as below : @xmath235 now , as shown in fig.2 , we consider a situation where the ejecta s symmetry axes makes an angle @xmath46 with the line of sight .",
    "the necessary condition that at least some photons of the emitting surface are detected by the near observer is : @xmath236 here we denote the inverse of function @xmath77 by @xmath237 , which gives the radius corresponding to @xmath238 . as seen in fig.2 , for @xmath46 s larger than @xmath239 ,",
    "the first photons reaching the detectors are those emitted at @xmath240 .",
    "so , we use @xmath76 ( which is obtainable by solving equation(11 ) ) to write : @xmath241 where @xmath242 represents the starting time ( in the source frame ) that the emitted photons can reach the ( cosmologicaly near ) observer .",
    "now , using the numerical results of equation(11 ) we can obtain the function @xmath243 .",
    "then , considering equation(c6 ) , the non - dimensional time @xmath244 corresponding to @xmath242 would be as below : @xmath245+\\eta_{0}&\\mbox : $ \\:\\:\\theta > \\zeta_{rad}(\\eta_{0})$                  } ~.\\ ] ] now , we are to find the time @xmath246 after which no photons can be detected by the near observer . in fig.2 , the photons emitted from the edge point @xmath247 can reach us at all times greater than @xmath242 .",
    "let s remind that in our model the emission process terminates at the time that the shocked matter goes out of the cloud ( appendix a ) . as is seen in equation(c6 ) , the closer to the point @xmath248 is a point on the emitting surface , the later its emitted photons would reach the near observer , of course , provided that the observer line - of - sight remains in the radiation cone of the emitting point . + defining : @xmath249 and recalling equation(c2 )",
    ", we can solve the equation : @xmath250 to find the function @xmath251 , which specifies the furthest point ( on the shock front at the radius @xmath82 ) which its radiation reaches us , of course , if it remains smaller than @xmath252 .",
    "+ now , using equation(c6 ) , we can find the instance that the last photons reach the near observer : @xmath253)+\\eta_{0}~.\\ ] ] finally , the non - dimensional time duration of a grb , @xmath83 , will be equal to @xmath254 and , as to equation(c12 ) and equation(c15 ) , besides being a function of parameters of the ejecta and the cloud , it is also a function of the inclination angle @xmath46 .",
    "so , the time duration of a grb as measured by an observer cosmologivally near to it would be a function of @xmath10 , @xmath19 , and @xmath46 : @xmath255 where : @xmath256 the expression(c16 ) needs some explanations . in our model",
    "the ejecta parameters @xmath8 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 and the radius @xmath9 are assumed to be the same in all grbs .",
    "so , these parameters do not appear in equation(c16 ) explicitly , though it is implicitly a function of them too . at the mean time ,",
    "the cloud s density @xmath19 and its thickness @xmath10 are assumed to be different in different directions , and therefore they do appear explicitly in the expression ( c16 ) .",
    "furthermore , if a cloud thickness @xmath10 is much more than its associated @xmath257 length @xmath258 , the ejecta may not cross it up , and finally stops in it . in such a situation the time duration of a grb would not be a function of @xmath10 , while it still remains dependent on @xmath19 and @xmath46 .",
    "this is why in expression ( c16 ) , the quantity @xmath10 is distinguished from @xmath19 and @xmath46 by a semicolon .",
    "the rearrangement of the expression(c16 ) in the form @xmath259 would be meaningful only when we are dealt with the situation where the ejecta succeed to cross up the cloud ( see eqn.[15 ] ) .",
    "here the relation between @xmath57 appearing in equation(23 ) and the grb occurring rate @xmath260 ( in units of @xmath261 ) is derived , so that by adopting a cosmological model for the occurring rate , the integral in equation(23 ) can be evaluated .",

    "we have : @xmath268 where @xmath269 is the hubble constant .",
    "furthermore , in frw metrics : @xmath270 where @xmath271 .",
    "now , using equations(d2 ) and ( d3 ) in equation(d1 ) we obtain : @xmath272 what is remained is the explicit form of @xmath260 . the high variability seen in grb light curves",
    "has convinced the investigators to relate grbs to stellar objects , and consequently their rate @xmath260 to the star formation rate @xmath273 .",
    "the simplest model is of course a proportional model @xmath274 .",
    "the proportional model may be correct if grbs are attributed to the evolution of massive stars whose lifetime is negligible in comparison with the cosmological time scale , but in ns - ns mergers model the proportionality may not be valid ( because of the delay time from the star formation to ns - ns mergers )",
    ". wijers et al .",
    "@xcite claimed that there is a good consistency between the proportional model and the observed grb brightness distribution , while petrosian & lloyd @xcite concluded that none of the ns - ns and the proportional model are in agreement with the observed @xmath273 .",
    "totani @xcite ascribed this discrepancy to the uncertainties in sfr observations .",
    "anyway we simply assume the grb rate to be as below : @xmath275 and treat @xmath72 as a free parameter that its best value should be obtained during the fitting procedure . in fig.14",
