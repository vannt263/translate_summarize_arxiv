    "the understanding of hadronic collisions is now considered an essential baseline for ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions . given the correspondingly low final - state multiplicities , there are significant deviations , even for inclusive samples , from assumptions commonly made both in the general theory and in the definition of experimentally measured quantities such as a nongaussian shape of the correlation function and nonpoissonian multiplicity distributions .",
    "constraints such as energy - momentum conservation @xcite would also play a role in at least some regions of phase space .",
    "multiplicity - class and fixed - multiplicity analysis differ increasingly from poissonian and inclusive distributions , and with the good statistics now available , measurements have become accurate enough to require proper understanding and treatment of these assumptions and deviations , which play an ever larger role with increasing order of correlation .",
    "there are a number of reasons to study correlations at fixed charged multiplicity @xmath0 or , if necessary , charged - multiplicity classes .",
    "firstly , the physics of multiparticle correlations will evidently change with @xmath0 , and indeed the multiplicity dependence of various quantities such as the intercept parameter and radii associated with gaussian parametrisations is under constant scrutiny @xcite .",
    "measurement of many observables as a function of multiplicity class , regarded a proxy for centrality dependence , has been routine for years .",
    "corresponding theoretical considerations , e.g.  in the quantum optical approach go back a long time @xcite .",
    "secondly , correlations for fixed-@xmath0 are the building blocks which are combined into multiplicity - class- and inclusive correlations @xcite",
    ".    however , such fixed-@xmath0 correlations have been beset by an inconsistency in that they are nonzero even when the underlying sample is uncorrelated and do not integrate to zero either .",
    "this has been recognised from the start @xcite , and various attempts have been made to fix the problem .",
    "combining events from several fixed-@xmath0 subsamples into multiplicity classes does not solve these problems . to quote an early reference @xcite : _ averaging over multiplicities inextricably mixes the properties of the correlation mechanism with those of the multiplicity distribution .",
    "instead , the study of correlations at fixed multiplicities allows one to separate both effects and to investigate the behaviour of correlation functions as a function of multiplicity .",
    "_ under the somewhat inappropriate name of `` long - range short - range correlations '' @xcite , an attempt was made to separate these multiplicity - mixing correlations from the fixed-@xmath0 correlations , but the inconsistencies inherent in the underlying fixed-@xmath0 correlations were not addressed .",
    "building on ref .",
    "@xcite , we propose doing so now .",
    "multiparticle cumulants have entered the mainstream of analysis , as shown by the following incomplete list of topics . in principle",
    ", the considerations presented in this paper would apply to any and all such cumulants to the degree that their reference distribution deviates from a poisson process or that the type of particle kept fixed differs from the particle being analysed .",
    "integrated cumulants of multiplicity distributions have a long history in multiparticle physics @xcite .",
    "second - order differential cumulants , normally termed `` correlation functions '' , have likewise been ubiquitous for decades @xcite both in charged - particles correlations @xcite and in femtoscopy since they provide information on spacetime characteristics of the emitting sources , most recently at the lhc @xcite .",
    "differential three - particle cumulants generically measure asymmetries in source geometry and exchange amplitude phases @xcite .",
    "they also provide consistency checks @xcite and a tool to disentangle the coherence parameter from other effects @xcite .",
    "three - particle cumulants are also sensitive to differences between longitudinal and transverse correlation lengths in the lund model @xcite .",
    "inclusive three - particle cumulants have been measured , albeit with different methodologies , in , for example , hadronic @xcite , leptonic @xcite and nuclear collisions @xcite .",
    "they play a central role in direct qcd - based calculations @xcite and in some recent theory and experiment of azimuthal and jet - like correlations @xcite .",
    "net - charge and other charge combinations are considered probes of the qcd phase diagram @xcite .",
    "cumulants of order 4 or higher are , of course , increasingly difficult to measure and so early investigations were largely confined to their scale dependence @xcite .",
    "the large event samples now available have , however , made feasible measurements of fourth- and higher - order cumulants in other variables as proposed in @xcite as , for example , recently measured by alice @xcite .",
    "reviews of femtoscopy theory range from @xcite to more recent ones such as @xcite .",
    "it has long been obvious that the root cause of the problems and inconsistencies set out in section [ sec : fxml ] was the reference sample @xcite .",
    "insofar as cumulants are concerned , the solution was outlined in ref .",
    "@xcite as a subtraction of the reference sample cumulant from the measured one ; important pieces of the puzzle were , however , still missing at that stage . in this paper , we clarify and extend the basic concept of internal cumulants and consider in detail the case of second- and third - order differential cumulants in the invariant @xmath3 for fixed charged multiplicity @xmath0 .",
    "the method may be implemented for other variables without much fuss .",
    "a second cornerstone of the present paper is the recognition that the @xmath4 particles which enter a correlation analysis are usually only a subset of the @xmath0 charged pions . while in the case of charged - particle correlations all @xmath0 particles",
    "are used in the analysis , bose - einstein correlations , for example , would use only the @xmath5 positive pions ( and , in a separate analysis , only the @xmath6 negatives ) .",
    "in addition , there may be reasons to restrict the analysis itself to subregions of the total acceptance @xmath7 in which @xmath0 was measured , as exemplified in this paper by restriction to a `` good azimuthal region '' subinterval around the beam axis , @xmath8 $ ] , in which detection efficiency is high .",
    "@xmath9 can , however , be reinterpreted generically as any restriction in momentum space compared to @xmath7 and/or as a selection such as charge or particle species . even when setting @xmath10 i.e.  doing the femtoscopy analysis in the full acceptance @xmath4 still does not equal @xmath0 but fluctuates around @xmath11 .",
    "the trivial observation that @xmath12 fundamentally changes the analysis : _ identical - particle correlations at fixed @xmath0 and charged - particle correlations at fixed @xmath0 require different definitions . _",
    "as we shall show , ad hoc prescriptions such as simply inserting prefactors or implementing event mixing using only events of the same @xmath0 do alleviate the effect of the overall nonpoissonian multiplicity distribution in part but fail to remove them completely .",
    "the same issues will , of course , arise in any other correlation type of , for example , nonidentical particles or net charge correlations .",
    "the formalism set out here can be easily extended to such cases .",
    "a refined version of the abovementioned long - range - short - range method , which we term `` averaged - internal '' cumulants , will be presented in section [ sec : smpab ] . along the way",
    ", we document in section [ sec : rdct ] extended versions of the particle counters @xcite which we need as the basis for correlation studies and in section [ sec : stderrors ] demonstrate from first principles that statistical errors for cumulants used so far have captured only some of the terms and with partly incorrect prefactors .",
    "section [ sec : vtmx ] outlines the implementation of event mixing for fixed-@xmath0 analysis . while experimental results will be published elsewhere , preliminary results in figs .  2 and 3",
    "show that , in third and even in second order , corrections due to proper treatment of fixed-@xmath0 reference samples can be large .",
    "the starting point for experimental correlation analysis is the inclusive sample @xmath13 , made up of @xmath14 events @xmath15 .",
    "each event consists of a varying number of final - state elementary particles and photons ; for our purposes , we consider only the @xmath16 charged pions of event @xmath17 in @xmath7 , the maximal acceptance region used .",
    "each pion @xmath18 is characterised by a data vector @xmath19 containing its measured information , including the three components of its momentum , @xmath20 , while its discrete attributes such as mass , charge etc .",
    "are captured in a data vector @xmath21 of discrete values ; for the moment , we shall consider only the charge , @xmath22 . from the sample",
    "s raw data , we can immediately find derived quantities such as the total charged multiplicity @xmath16 , the total transverse energy etc . , and",
    "such derived quantities are hence considered part of the raw data .",
    "the list of particle attributes should be augmented by an error vector @xmath23 containing the measurement errors for each track , but we shall not consider detector resolution errors here . in summary , the inclusive data sample is fully described in terms of @xmath24 consisting of lists of vectors in continuous and discrete spaces @xmath25      for a particular analysis ,",
    "the inclusive sample is invariably subdivided and modified through `` conditioning '' , the statistics terminology for semi - inclusive or triggered analysis : from the total sample of events , a subsample is selected according to some restriction or precondition . in our case , this conditioning proceeds in the following steps :    * _ conditioning into fixed-@xmath0 subsamples : _ for the fixed - multiplicity analyses that form the subject of this paper , @xmath13 is subdivided into a set of fixed-@xmath0 subsamples @xmath26 , each of which contains only events @xmath17 whose measured multiplicity @xmath16 is equal to the constant @xmath0 characterising @xmath27 we use the vertical bar @xmath28 here and everywhere in the usual sense of `` conditioning '' whereby the events in sample @xmath26 must satisfy the condition that their charged multiplicity must equal the specified constant @xmath0 , denoted in this case by the kronecker delta @xmath29 .",
    "quantities to the right of the vertical bar are generally considered known and fixed , while quantities left of the bar are variable or unknown .",
    "the number of events in @xmath26 equals the @xmath30-restricted sum over the inclusive sample , @xmath31 the usual multiplicity distribution is the list of relative frequencies , .",
    "we therefore avoid the use of the symbol @xmath32 for such and similar data ratios . ] @xmath33 while desirable , it is not easy to measure the total multiplicity of final - state charged pions , a quantity which approximately tracks the variation in the physics . choosing charged pions measured within the maximal detector acceptance @xmath34 as marker is in any case only an approximation because it excludes charged particles outside the primary cuts and also ignores final - state particles other than charged pions .",
    "nevertheless , we expect @xmath0 to be a reasonable measure of the multiplicity dependence of the physics .",
    "alternatively , the multiplicity density in pseudorapidity at central rapidities @xmath35 can be used as a model - dependent proxy for @xmath0 . * _ azimuthal cut : _ while @xmath16 is the charged multiplicity measured in @xmath7 , there is no _ a priori _ reason why the correlation analysis itself may not be conducted within a restricted part @xmath36 of momentum space within which the actual analysis is done . in the case of the ua1 detector from which the data used in the examples below was drawn",
    ", @xmath9 refers to azimuthal regions within which measurement efficiency was high , and pions found in the low - efficiency azimuthal regions were excluded .",
    "correspondingly , the multiplicity @xmath37 which enters the correlation analysis itself differs from @xmath16 and will , for a given fixed @xmath0 fluctuate with relative frequency @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the number of events for which @xmath40 and @xmath41 . the outcome space for @xmath37 will depend on its definition ; in the present case where only positive ( or only negative ) pions within @xmath9 are used in the analysis",

    "this section is based on an old formalism @xcite which must , however , be updated to accommodate the issues being considered here . the basic building block of correlation analysis is the _ counter _ ; it is a particular projection of the raw data particular suited to the construction of histograms .",

    ", @xmath137 is subpoissonian and so @xmath237 falls below the poisson limit of 1 .",
    "the correction from fixed-@xmath0 poissonian to internal normalised cumulants is hence upward , not downward as in the case of multiplicity - mixing corrections .",
    "8 .   while not the main subject of the present paper , some light is cast on the relationship between three levels of correlation , viz .",
    "correlations inherent in the overall multiplicity distribution , multiplicity - mixing correlations , and the true internal correlations for fixed @xmath0 .",
    "each of these can and should be treated separately .",
    "the averaged - internal correlations of section [ sec : smpab ] are a compromise solution which may be useful both for physics reasons and for small datasets .",
    "the fixed-@xmath0 corrections discussed here are separate and complementary to other important effects at low multiplicity .",
    "@xcite highlight , for example , possible effects of `` residual correlations '' resulting from projecting from multipion to two - pion correlations .",
    "+ energy - momentum conservation would also play a role .",
    "borghini @xcite has , for example , calculated the effect of momentum conservation for normalised two- and three - particle cumulants in momenta and @xmath431 .",
    "however , the saddlepoint method used applies to the large-@xmath0 limit and the results can not be directly applied to the low-@xmath0 ( and hence low-@xmath4 ) samples under discussion here .",
    "indeed , momentum conservation will be near - irrelevant for cases of large @xmath0 and small @xmath4 as discussed above , but the small-@xmath4 corrections of this paper will remain important . for the specific case of like - sign pion femtoscopy ,",
    "the fact that only @xmath432 out of the @xmath0 charged pions are used and that momentum conservation constraints include all other final - state particles both imply that momentum conservation constraints may be less important than the internal - cumulant correction introduced here .",
    "+ for the specific choice of correlation variables @xmath212 and @xmath433 for two- and three - particle cumulants , the contribution of momentum conservation to cumulants at small @xmath212 will be small since the counts will be dominated by pairs at small @xmath434 and intermediate @xmath435 . as pointed out by @xcite , momentum conservation exerts greatest influence at large pair or triplet momenta and hence mostly at large @xmath212 , where it may lead to moments and cumulants which do not converge to a constant as presupposed in most fits .",
    "the ad hoc method of multiplying fit parametrisations by a prefactor @xmath436 with @xmath52 a free parameter does not adequately address the problem .",
    "+ regarding the multiplicity dependence of the influence of energy - momentum conservation , ref .",
    "@xcite calculates the effect of energy - momentum conservation on single - particle differential observables , and finds significant systematic effects .",
    "no doubt this must also be the case for multiparticle observables , although , as we have pointed out above , the effect of conservation laws will be diluted by the fact that fewer than half of the final - state particles of any given event are actually used in the present analysis .",
    "detailed investigations are beyond the scope of this paper . 10 .",
    "we have also recalculated statistical errors for products of event averages starting from the original prescription which forms the basis of frequentist statistical error calculations .",
    "compared to conventional statistical error calculations , new prefactors appear in our calculations  see e.g.  eq .",
    "( [ sce ] ) and the results in section [ sec : setc ]  which have surprisingly been missed so far . 11 .",
    "we note that the present formalism is still in the frequentist statistics mindset , which may be inaccurate for low multiplicities and should be supplanted by a proper bayesian analysis .",
    "the final word has certainly not been spoken about correlation analysis of small-@xmath4 datasets .",
