    "computation of a common mean ( cm ) of several independent measurements of a physical quantity is a common procedure in scientific analysis .",
    "typical task include combining results obtained by different analysts or results based on different measurement methods or results of several series of measurements , etc .",
    "one of the most important applications required computation of a cm is derivation of the best estimate of physical constants .",
    "both accurate cm value and its realistic uncertainty are equally important in such computations .",
    "input information consists of measured values @xmath0 , @xmath1 with associated uncertainties @xmath2 , usually standard deviations ( std ) , and correlations between @xmath0 are not available . from statistical point of view , it is a classical case of direct measurements of unequal precision . due to lack of needed information",
    "we have to treat them as uncorrelated .",
    "combination procedure aimed to get an estimate @xmath3 of the cm @xmath4 with associated uncertainty @xmath5 , which adequately reflects the scatter and uncertainties of input measurements .",
    "there is no unambiguous solution of this problem .",
    "it is well known the the classical weighted average ( wa ) is unbiased cm estimate with minimum variance , provided @xmath0 are independent unbiased estimators , and @xmath6 are true variances .",
    "a solution of the problem is not straightforward if true variances are unknown .",
    "numerous papers are devoted to computation of a cm and its uncertainty ; see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "unfortunately , results are obtained under rather strong assumptions : the @xmath0 are unbiased estimates of @xmath3 , @xmath2 are normally distributed , and number of measurements @xmath7 formed each @xmath0 is known .",
    "evidently , these assumptions are hardly met in scientific data analysis .",
    "the situation becomes even more complicated because small samples are are the rule rather than the exception in such tasks , which makes it difficult to efficiently apply most of statistical methods generally used .    for these reasons many alternative approaches ,",
    "not always strongly justified , are mostly used , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , and dataplot software documentation .",
    "we do not aim this paper at investigation of all the existing methods .",
    "such a task seems to be impractical because some methods can not be used in our case because we lack needed information , some are developed for specific applications , and some approaches may be too complicated for routine use , e.g. bootstrapping @xcite or total median @xcite .",
    "we consider two basic methods most commonly used : wa and median . as to the former , several approaches to compute its uncertainty ( std ) are proposed in literature .",
    "this paper is devoted to comparison of this methods based on simulated and real data . besides",
    ", a new combined approach is proposed to compute the wa uncertainty .",
    "this approach was proposed for the first time in @xcite and has shown to be useful in practical applications such as computation of earth orientation parameter ( eop ) combined solution @xcite , radio source position catalogues combination @xcite , analysis of radio source position time series @xcite , and modeling the galactic aberration @xcite .",
    "special attention is given to analysis of small statistical samples .",
    "the wa estimator is most widely used in various scientific and practical applications .",
    "let we have @xmath8 values @xmath0 with associated standard deviations @xmath2 , @xmath9 .",
    "then we can compute the following statistics ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) @xmath10    in result , we have the classical wa estimate @xmath11 with weights inversely proportional to variances of input measurements @xmath6 .",
    "we also can compute the following statistics also used as a measure of goodness of fit @xmath12 ^ 2 } \\",
    ", \\label{eq : h}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 has a @xmath14 distribution with @xmath15 degree of freedom ( @xmath16 ) if @xmath6 are theoretical variances . in practice ,",
    "@xmath6 are , as a rule , sample variances , but this fact is usually ignored .",
    "the @xmath13 statistics is an indicator of consistency of input measurements .",
    "if the measurements are consistent , the value @xmath17 is close to unity .",
    "otherwise one can assume that the input measurements @xmath0 have systematic errors or @xmath2 are underestimated .",
    "the question is how to estimate the standard error @xmath5 of the mean ?",
    "two main approaches can be applied to compute @xmath5 .",
    "the classical wa estimate is @xmath18    least squares approach leads to alternative estimate of the wa uncertainty .",
    "the solution of the least square problem @xmath19 with weights @xmath20 gives the same wa estimate @xmath3 , but another estimate of its uncertainty : @xmath21    this estimate of the wa uncertainty is , in fact , @xmath22 estimate scaled in such a way to make @xmath23 close to unity : @xmath24 which is equivalent to scaling of input @xmath2 by the factor @xmath25 as recommended by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , such a scaling makes resulting @xmath5 estimate independent of the `` scale '' of input variances @xmath6 , and dependent only on their ratio .",
    "so , both approaches give the same estimate for the wa , but different estimates for the wa uncertainty .",
    "the first value @xmath22 depends on @xmath2 and does not depend on the scatter of the input values @xmath0 . on the other hand , @xmath26 depends on relative values of input variances @xmath6 and the scatter of @xmath0 .",
    "difference between the two @xmath5 estimates may be attributed to systematic errors in @xmath0 or underestimated @xmath2 .",
    "theoretically , choice between @xmath22 and @xmath26 depends on whether the scatter of @xmath0 is a result of random error or there are systematic differences between estimates @xmath0 .",
    "obviously , both effects are present in most of practical applications .",
    "this is a well recognized problem in data analysis , and its rigorous solution is hardly possible due to generally biased input estimates , not always adequate reported uncertainties , and unknown error distribution .    in practice , if @xmath0 are close each other and @xmath2 are greater than the scatter of @xmath0 , it seems reasonable to use @xmath22 .",
    "otherwise , if @xmath2 are much less than the scatter of the input measurements , @xmath26 estimate seems to be more adequate to the data .",
    "indeed such a way to choose the best estimate for the wa uncertainty can not be considered satisfactory .    a possible practical",
    ", statistically based approach has been proposed by rosenfeld et al .",
    "( 1967 ) and @xcite .",
    "according to this approach , @xmath14 criteria is used to decide whether the scatter of @xmath0 is a result of random errors .",
    "first , both uncertainty estimates @xmath22 and @xmath26 are computed .",
    "then the final wa uncertainty is taken as @xmath27 \\sigma_2 , & \\",
    "\\mbox{if $ h > \\chi^2(q , n-1)$ } \\ ,",
    "\\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\label{eq : sigma_3}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is a significance level .",
    "one can see that to a first approximation @xmath29 for consistent measurements and @xmath30 for discrepant ones , and given @xmath28 value is used to distinguish between them . as a consequence",
    ", substantially different @xmath5 estimates can be obtained for the same input measurements @xmath31 but specifying different @xmath28 .",
    "similar approach is discussed by @xcite .",
    "it recommends accept @xmath22 as the estimate of the cm mean uncertainty if consistency check @xmath32 passed at a significance level @xmath28=5% ; otherwise supplement studies should be performed , such check of outliers , investigation of input data , etc .",
    "unfortunately , the latter is generally not feasible .",
    "as pointed out in the previous section , the literature recommends using either @xmath22 or @xmath26 depending on some criteria , which can lead to ambiguous results , keeping in mind that these two estimates may differ by several times .",
    "so , a more robust @xmath5 estimate is desirable for practical use , which would account of both the scatter of @xmath0 and their uncertainties @xmath2 .",
    "after investigation of behavior of all three estimates using simulated and real data , and supplement tests we decided in favor of combined estimate computed by simple formula @xmath33    as a variant , @xmath26 computed with unit weights can be used , which provides clear separation of impacts at combined estimate @xmath34 from the uncertainties ( @xmath22 ) and scatter ( @xmath26 ) of the input measurements .",
    "however , in this case , the result is generally more sensitive to measurements suspected to be outliers .",
    "unfortunately , we can not suggest a rigorous theoretical ground of this approach , which is common for other practical recommendations too .",
    "our considerations are as follows .",
    "suppose we can represent each input value as @xmath35 , where @xmath4 is the true value of the cm , @xmath36 is a random error distributed as @xmath37 and @xmath38 is a systematic error of the @xmath0 measurement distributed as @xmath39 . here",
    "@xmath40 is considered as a measure of the scatter of the set of systematic errors in input measurements .",
    "evidently , @xmath38 is unknown , otherwise it would be accounted for in the reported value of @xmath0 .",
    "we can suppose that @xmath38 biases @xmath0 but does not bias @xmath2 .",
    "thus the mathematical expectation of each @xmath0 is @xmath41 now we can use the set of @xmath8 equations  ( [ eq : xi_expectation ] ) for @xmath1 as an equations of condition to be solved by the least squares method . as a result of this solution",
    ", we obtain an estimate of @xmath4 and its uncertainty @xmath40 , which can be expected close to @xmath26",
    ". then we can consider @xmath42 as an additive error in the wa uncertainty . combining this error with @xmath22 computed under the assumption of absence of systematic errors in @xmath0 we get @xmath34 as defined by eq  [ eq : sigma_c ] .",
    "finally , let us notice that ( [ eq : sigma_c ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath43 so , to obtain @xmath34 estimate , there is no need to compute separately both @xmath22 and @xmath26 and then use eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma_c ] ) .",
    "another approach routinely used to get the estimate of a cm is computation of a median @xmath44 . the median is known as a robust statistics less influenced by outliers .",
    "however its standard definition does not provide an estimate of error of a median value ( it makes it immune to unreliable uncertainties though ) .    a possible approach to compute a median uncertainty was proposed by @xcite .",
    "let @xmath45 be the median of @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath46 .",
    "now we can compute the median of the absolute deviations ( mad ) as @xmath47    the uncertainty of @xmath48 is then taken as @xmath49    one can see that this estimate of the median uncertainty depends only on the data scatter and not on input uncertainties .",
    "later @xcite proposed a method to take account of the uncertainty in input data and thus compute weighted median and its uncertainty .",
    "however its practical realization , as pointed out by the author , is more cumbersome , and the testing results and discussion given therein do not show clear advantage of using weighted median .",
    "in this section , results of two tests with simulated data are presented .",
    "these tests were constructed to investigate in more details the behavior of the @xmath5 estimates introduced in the previous section . indeed , many of features discussed here can be seen directly from corresponding equations , but not so demonstrative .",
    "table  [ tab : stat_examples ] shows some numerical examples of computation of wa for two measurements , and its standard deviation . to compute @xmath50 we used @xmath28=99% , which corresponds to @xmath14(0.99,1)=6.635 . using @xmath28=95% , @xmath14(0.95,1)=3.841 does not change main conclusions . note that , unlike general practice , we keep several significant digits in uncertainty just to better show the difference between various estimates .",
    "classical example 1 shows that @xmath26 can not provide reasonable estimate for @xmath5 whatever how large input uncertainty are given .",
    "examples 27 and 815 show how @xmath5 estimates change with grown @xmath2 for the same @xmath0 .",
    "examples 1623 show how @xmath5 estimates change with grown @xmath51 for the same @xmath52 and @xmath2 .",
    "one can see that no one of @xmath22 , @xmath26 , @xmath50 provides a satisfactory estimate of @xmath5 for all the examples .",
    "several observations from table  [ tab : stat_examples ] are as follows .",
    "the @xmath22 estimate sometimes it is clearly underestimated ( examples 812 ) .",
    "examples 27 and 815 illustrate that @xmath26 ( 2 ) can not provide satisfactory estimate , especially in the cases 7 , 14 , 15 , where it seems to be underestimated .",
    "estimate @xmath50 gives more realistic result , but not in all the cases , e.g. 23 and 811 .",
    "moreover , @xmath50 value depends not only on data sample @xmath53 but also on subjective choice of @xmath28 .",
    "besides , as can be seen from this test and eq .",
    "[ eq : sigma_3 ] that @xmath50 may show significant jumps caused by small changes in input data or confidence level . for these reasons",
    ", it was decided not to use @xmath50 in further work .",
    "in contrast to @xmath22 , @xmath26 , and @xmath50 , one can see that @xmath34 approach can provide stable and realistic estimate of the standard deviation of the wa .    [ cols=\">,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    in the second test , results of determination of average values of the oort constants in @xcite are revised ( see fig  [ fig : oort ] ) . for comparison ,",
    "the author s estimates are @xmath54 for a , and @xmath55 for b , with uncertainties computed as @xmath22 and evidently rounded up .",
    "this value of the wa uncertainty is likely underestimated as compared to input data uncertainties and scatter .",
    "median uncertainty also seems underestimated because it accounts only for relatively small scatter , and ignores relatively large measurement uncertainties . in this example",
    ", @xmath34 estimate again looks the most realistic and corresponding to input data .",
    "although computation of a cm , in particular wa , is widely used in data analysis , this problem has no definite , unambiguity solution yet .",
    "in particular , a very important problem in most of applications is to obtain a `` realistic '' estimate for the cm uncertainty .",
    "both underestimation and overestimation are equally undesirable .    in this study",
    ", we mostly investigated several basic approaches to compute a wa .",
    "currently used methods for computation of the wa uncertainty do not provide satisfactory result for many practical tasks .",
    "the classical wa uncertainty estimate @xmath22 often yields underestimated value because it is rigorously justified for unbiased @xmath0 only .",
    "another estimate @xmath26 , which can be derived from a least squares solution or by appropriate scaling of the input uncertainties , does not take account of input uncertainties , but only of the variance ratio .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a new approach to compute the wa uncertainty , combined estimate @xmath34 given by ( [ eq : sigma_c ] ) and ( [ eq : sigma_c2 ] ) , which is able to account for both uncertainties and scatter of input data .",
    "we did not propose a rigorous statistical background for this estimate .",
    "however , it can be shown that in the case when input values @xmath0 are obtained from a normally distributed populations , and each value @xmath0 has a normally distributed systematic error , proposed estimate @xmath34 can be derived from a least squares solution .",
    "it appears probable that this estimate is suitable for practical use until the deviation from normality is very large .",
    "several tests with simulated and real measurements have demonstrated that using @xmath34 is a simple and effective approach equally suitable for both discrepant and consistent measurements .",
    "it is also important that it provides realistic @xmath5 estimate even for very small samples of 23 measurements .    as to the median approach , it is known as a more robust cm estimate , but computation of its uncertainty is not so straightforward .",
    "a simple approach by @xcite seems to be not satisfactory in some cases , as follows from our tests . in this respect ,",
    "the bootstrap method and extended bootstrap method @xcite deserve consideration ; this methods may be too complicated for routine use though .    in conclusion , one should never forget the following . despite the method used ,",
    "the cm uncertainty is only a part of real measurement accuracy , namely a type a uncertainty according to the standard metrological terminology . by definition ,",
    "type a uncertainty is computed from data using statistical procedures , while a type b uncertainty is obtained using supplement information and theoretical considerations ( see e.g. @xcite .",
    "sometimes , the type b uncertainty is evaluated from supplement testing data processing , e.g. using subsets of the original data set .",
    "it can also be a result not of mathematical computation , but considerations based on the knowledge of the measurement procedures , observational history , and previous experience .",
    "such procedures were used e.g. to derive the best estimates of some quantities related to solar system dynamics @xcite , and to compute realistic errors in radio source positions for the second realization of the international celestial reference frame @xcite ."
