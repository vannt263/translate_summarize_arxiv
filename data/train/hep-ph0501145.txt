    "while the light quarks and leptons can be regarded as perturbative spectators to the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , the massive top quark with a mass of ewsb scale suggests that top quark is potentially enjoying a more intimate role in the flavor dynamics and/or horizontal symmetry breaking .",
    "a potential implication of this is the possibility that there exist extra interactions for top quark , which distinguishs top quark from other fermions of the standard model ( sm ) at the electroweak scale .",
    "if this is true , the top quark physics will be much richer than that of the sm and possible large deviations of top quark properties from the sm predictions are expected @xcite .",
    "detailed study about such new physics effects may reveal useful information about the underlying interactions and the mechanism of ewsb .",
    "such study is essential when one considers the advancement in experiments where the forthcoming cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) and the planned next - generation linear collider ( nlc ) will sever as top quark factories and thus make the precise measurements of top quark properties possible  @xcite . in this paper , we restrict our discussion in the framework of the topcolor - assisted technicolor model ( tc2)@xcite , in this model , the third generation is singled out to participate in a special interaction called topcolor interaction .",
    "such an interaction will cause the top quark condensation which can partially contribute to ewsb and also provide main part of top quark mass .",
    "the tc2 model generally predicts a number of scalars , and some of them couple very strongly to the top quark .",
    "so , we expect the tc2 corrections to the top quark properties are larger than those of the other models which treat generations in an egalitarian manner , such as the popular minimal supersymmetry model ( mssm)@xcite .",
    "although the various exotic production processes@xcite and the rare decay modes of the top quark@xcite can serve as a robust probe of the tc2 model , the role of the dominant decay mode @xmath4 should not be underestimated@xcite .",
    "one advantage of this decay mode is that it is free of non - perturbative theoretical uncertainties@xcite and future precision experimental data can be compared with the accurate theoretical predictions .",
    "the other advantage of this channel is that the @xmath5-boson , as a decay product , is strongly polarized and the helicity contents ( transverse - plus @xmath6 , transverse - minus @xmath7 and longitudinal @xmath8 ) of the @xmath5-boson can be probed through the measurement of the shape of the lepton spectrum in the @xmath5-boson decay@xcite . among the three polarizations of the @xmath5-boson in the top quark decaying , the longitudinal mode is of particular interesting since it is useful to understand the mechanism of ewsb@xcite .",
    "therefore , the study of top quark decaying into the polarized @xmath5-boson can provide some additional information about both the @xmath9 coupling and ewsb . on the experimental side ,",
    "the cdf collaboration has already performed the measurement of the helicity component of the @xmath5-boson in the top quark decaying from run  1 data and obtained the results @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the total decay rate of @xmath12 , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote respectively the rates of top quark decaying into a longitudinal and transverse - plus @xmath5-boson . although the error of these measurements is quite large at the present time , it is expected to be reduced significantly during run  2 of the tevatron and may reach @xmath15 at the lhc @xcite . on the theoretical side ,",
    "the predictions of these quantities in the sm up to one - loop level are now available @xcite .",
    "the tree - level results are 0.703 for @xmath16 , 0.297 for @xmath17 and @xmath18 for @xmath19 , and the qcd corrections to these predictions are respectively @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , while the electroweak corrections are at the level of a few per mill .    in order to probe the new physics from the future precise measurement of @xmath16 , @xmath17 or @xmath19 , we must know the new physics contributions to these quantities in various models . by now",
    ", the one - loop corrections to the total width of @xmath23 in the framework of mssm have been studied in @xcite and the corrections to @xmath16 , @xmath17 or @xmath19 in mssm were recently studied in ref.@xcite , but the similar study in the tc2 model is absent . studying the corrections on these quantities in the tc2 model is the main goal of this paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the section",
    "ii , we first briefly introduce the tc2 model , then we calculate the corrections and discuss our numerical results .",
    "the conclusions are given in section iii .",
    "among various kinds of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking models , the tc2 model @xcite is especially attractive since it combines the fancy ideas of technicolor@xcite and top quark condensation@xcite without conflicting with low energy experimental data .",
    "the basic thought of the tc2 model is to introduce two strongly interacting sectors .",
    "one sector(topcolor interaction ) provides the main part of top quark mass but has the small contribution to ewsb , while the other sector(technicolor interaction ) is responsible for the bulk of ewsb and the masses of light fermions . at ewsb scale , this model predicts two groups of scalars corresponding to the technicolor condensates and topcolor condensates , respectively@xcite . either of them can be arranged into a @xmath24 doublet@xcite , and their roles in tc2 model are quite analogous to the higgs fields in the model proposed in ref.@xcite which is a special two - higgs - doublet model in essence .",
    "explicit speaking , the doublet @xmath25 which corresponds to the technicolor condensates is mainly responsible for ewsb and light fermion masses , it also contributes a small portion of top quark mass . because its vacuum expectation value ( vev ) @xmath26 is near the ewsb scale(@xmath27 ) , the yukawa couplings of this doublet to the fermions are small . while the doublet @xmath28 which corresponds to the topcolor condensates plays a minor role in ewsb and only couples to the third generation quarks , its main task is to generate the large top quark mass . since the the vev of @xmath28 ( denoted as @xmath29 )",
    "can not be large(see below ) , the doublet @xmath28 can couple strongly to top quark to generate the expected top quark mass .",
    "one distinct feature of this model is that there exist tree level flavor changing couplings for the two scalar fields(@xmath30)@xcite which is theoretically disfavored",
    ". such defect may be partially alleviated if the mixing angle between two scalar fields , which is a model dependent parameter , satisfies @xmath31@xcite . in this case , only one scalar field has the flavor changing couplings and the rearranged lagrangian has the following characteristics : one rearranged doublet is fully responsible for ewsb , but with small yukawa coupling to all fermions ; while the other rearranged doublet(denoted as : @xmath32 ) has strong yukawa coupling with the third generation quarks@xcite .",
    "the lagrangian relevant to our calculation then can be written as . as far as the process considered in this paper",
    ", these two natural choices of @xmath33 do not make any significant difference in numerical results since in both cases , @xmath34 is top condensates dominant . but",
    "our choice of @xmath35 will make the calculation simplified . ]",
    "@xmath36 where , @xmath37 gev , @xmath38 is the yukawa coupling , @xmath39 is the @xmath40 top - bottom doublet as usual , @xmath41 is the rearranged @xmath42 doublet and takes the form @xmath43 and the covariant derivative is @xmath44 with the hypercharge of the doublet is @xmath45 and @xmath46 is @xmath47 . in eq.([laga ] ) , the factor @xmath48 indicates the mixing effect between the two doublets .",
    "the physical particles ( @xmath49 ) and @xmath50 in the @xmath32 field are called top - pions and top - higgs , respectively .    from eq.([laga ] ) , one can learn that the tc2 parameters relevant to our discussion are @xmath51 , @xmath52 and the masses of the top - pions and top - higgs . before numerical evaluation",
    ", we recapitulate the theoretical and experimental constraints on these parameters .    in the tc2 model",
    ", @xmath53 parameterizes the portion of the extended technicolor contribution to the top quark mass .",
    "the bare value of @xmath53 is generated at the etc scale , and can obtain a large radiative enhancement from topcolor and @xmath54 by a factor of order @xmath55 at the weak scale@xcite .",
    "this @xmath53 can induce a nonzero top - pion mass ( proportional to @xmath56 ) @xcite which can ameliorate the problem of having dangerously light scalars .",
    "numerical analysis shows that , with reasonable choice of other input parameters , @xmath53 with order @xmath57 may induce top - pions as massive as the top quark@xcite .",
    "indirect phenomenological constraints on @xmath53 come from low energy flavor changing processes such as @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "however , these constraints are very weak . precise value of @xmath53 may be obtained by elaborately measuring the coupling strength between top - pions / top - higgs and top quark at the next linear colliders . from theoretical point of view , @xmath53 with value from @xmath59 to @xmath60 is favored . for the mode @xmath12 considered in this paper , @xmath53 affects our results via @xmath61 , we fix @xmath62 conservatively in this paper .",
    "now , we turn to discuss the parameter @xmath29 .",
    "the pagels - stokar formula @xcite gives the expression of @xmath29 in terms of the number of quark color @xmath63 , the top quark mass @xmath64 , and the scale @xmath65 at which the condensation occurs : @xmath66 from this formula , one can infer that , if @xmath67 condensation is fully responsible for ewsb , i.e. @xmath68 gev , then , @xmath65 is about @xmath69 gev .",
    "such a large value is less attractive since one expects new physics scale should not be far higher than the weak scale by the original idea of technicolor theory@xcite . on the other hand , if one believes new physics exists at tev scale , i.e. , @xmath70 tev , then @xmath71 gev , which means that @xmath72 condensation can not be wholly responsible for ewsb and the breaking of electroweak symmetry needs the joint effort of topcolor and other interactions like technicolor . by the way , eq.([ft ] ) should be only understood as a rough guide , and @xmath29 may be somewhat lower or higher . in this paper",
    ", we use the value @xmath73 gev to illustrate the numerical results .",
    "finally , we focus on the mass bounds of top - pions and top - higgs . on the theoretical side ,",
    "some estimates have been done .",
    "the mass splitting between the neutral top - pion and the charged top - pions should be small since such splitting comes only from the electroweak interactions@xcite .",
    "ref.@xcite has estimated the masses of top - pions using quark loop approximation and showed that the masses are allowed to be a few hundred gev in the reasonable parameter space .",
    "like eq.([ft ] ) , such estimates can only be regarded as a rough guide and the precise values of top - pion masses can only be determined by future experiments .",
    "the mass of the top - higgs @xmath74 can be estimated in the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model in the large @xmath75 approximation @xcite and is found to be about @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "this estimates is also rather crude and the mass below the @xmath77 threshold is quite possible in a variety of scenarios @xcite . on the experimental side ,",
    "the current experiments have restricted the masses of the charged top - pions .",
    "for example , the absence of @xmath78 implies that @xmath79 gev @xcite and @xmath80 analysis yields @xmath81 gev @xcite . for the masses of neutral top - pion and top - higgs , the experimental restrictions on them are rather weak .",
    "the direct search for the neutral top - pion ( top - higgs ) via @xmath82 , has an unobservably small rate since there exists severe cancellation between diagrams contributing to this process @xcite . ] with @xmath83 has been proved to be hopeless at tevatron with the top - pion ( top - higgs ) heavier than @xmath84 gev @xcite .",
    "the single production of @xmath85 ( @xmath34 ) at tevatron with @xmath85 ( @xmath34 ) mainly decaying to @xmath86 may shed some light on detecting the neutral top - pion ( top - higgs)@xcite , but the potential for the detection is limited by the size of the mixing between top and charm quarks . on the other hand , the detailed background analysis is absent now .",
    "anyhow , these mass bounds will be greatly tightened at the upcoming lhc @xcite . in our following discussion",
    ", we will neglect the mass difference among the top - pions and denote the mass of them as @xmath87 .",
    "generally speaking , the effective @xmath88 vertex at one loop level gets the contribution from penguin diagrams , fermion self - energy diagrams as well as w boson self - energy diagrams . as far as tc2 model is concerned , the leading part of the first two kinds of diagrams is @xmath89 , while that for the last kind of diagrams is @xmath90 .",
    "considering @xmath91 , we can safely neglect the contribution of w boson self - energy .",
    "so , the diagrams we need to calculate are only those shown in fig.[feynman ] .",
    "the effective @xmath88 can be written as @xmath92+\\gamma^{\\mu}p_{r}f_{r}+p_{t}^{\\mu}p_{l}\\widetilde{f}_{l}+p_{t}^{\\mu } p_{r}\\widetilde{f}_{r}\\}\\ ] ] here @xmath93 are the chirality projectors .",
    "the form factors @xmath94 and @xmath95 represent the contributions from the irreducible vertex loops . @xmath96 and",
    "@xmath97 denote respectively the field renormalization constants for bottom quark and top quark .",
    "the explicit expressions are given by ( we have neglected bottom quark mass ) @xmath98 \\\\ \\delta z_b^l & = & \\frac{(1-\\epsilon)^2}{16 \\pi^2 } \\frac{v_w^2-f_t^2}{v_w^2 } \\left ( \\frac { m_t}{\\sqrt{2 } f_t } \\right ) ^2 2 b_1^d   \\label{factor2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the functions @xmath99 and @xmath100 are respectively two - point , three - point feynman integrals defined in@xcite and their functional dependences are @xmath101 respectively , and @xmath102 denotes @xmath103 .    the rate of the top quark decaying into the polarized @xmath5-boson can be obtained either by helicity amplitude method@xcite or by the project technique introduced in ref.@xcite .",
    "their expressions are given by @xmath104 where @xmath13 ( @xmath105 ) denotes the rate of the top quark decaying into the longitudinal ( transverse - minus ) @xmath5-boson and @xmath106 . in deriving eqs.([gammal],[gammam ] ) , we have neglected the @xmath107-quark mass for simplicity which will produce an uncertainty of several per mille on @xmath108 .",
    "another consequence of neglecting @xmath109 is @xmath110 due to angular momentum conservation @xcite .",
    "then , the total decay rate of @xmath23 is obtained by @xmath111 . for convenience ,",
    "we define the ratios @xmath112 which can be measured in experiments .",
    "we present the relative tc2 corrections as : @xmath113 with @xmath114 denoting the tc2 corrections and @xmath115 denoting the sm predictions . in our numerical evaluation , we fixed @xmath116 gev@xcite , @xmath117 , @xmath118 gev and @xmath119 , and vary @xmath120 in experimentally allowed region .    the fig.[wid ] are the plots of the relative tc2 correction to the decay width @xmath121 .",
    "one distinctive feature of such correction is that , for fixed @xmath122 , after the deviation from the sm predictions reaches its minimum at a certain value of @xmath123 , the relative correction increases monotonously .",
    "this indicates that there are cancellations among different diagrams , the deviation will decrease monotonously with increasing @xmath123 to approach a constant . ] .",
    "another feature is that the correction is negative in all allowed parameter space .",
    "noticing the fact that qcd correction to @xmath121 is @xmath124@xcite , one can conclude that the tc2 correction can enlarge the quantum effects . from fig.2 ,",
    "one can see that , for the light top - higgs , the relative correction can reach @xmath125 . comparing with the correction in the popular mssm model where the susy - qcd correction and the susy - ew correction tend to cancel each other@xcite , we find that the tc2 correction is larger than either of susy - qcd and susy - ew correction and tc2 correction might be detectable at the future high energy colliders@xcite .",
    "in fig.[wid ] , we have fixed @xmath126 as 50 gev . to get the correction for any other choice of @xmath29",
    ", we just multiply the results of fig.[wid ] by a factor @xmath127 ( for example , multiplying a factor 1.6 for @xmath128 gev and 0.35 for @xmath129 gev ) .    in fig.[widl ] and fig.[wid- ] , we show the relative tc2 correction to @xmath130 and @xmath131 as a function of @xmath132 .",
    "one can see that the correction is below @xmath133 , smaller than the corresponding qcd correction@xcite but larger than the corresponding mssm corrections@xcite . comparing with the results in fig.[wid ] , we can see that the correction to @xmath134 is smaller than that to total decay width .",
    "this is due to the cancellation between the correction to @xmath135 and to @xmath11 in eq.(14 ) .",
    "for example , when we take @xmath136 gev and @xmath137 gev , the relative correction to the total width @xmath138 is about @xmath139(@xmath140 and @xmath141 , respectively ) , but for the same values of @xmath142 and @xmath87 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 . comparing with the experimental data",
    ", we can conclude that the theoretical prediction of @xmath145 including the tc2 correction should be within the experimentally allowed region .",
    "in this paper , we study the tc2 correction to the mode @xmath146 . we find that , due to the cancellations among different diagrams , the tc2 correction to the width @xmath0 is generally several percent in the allowed parameter region",
    ". the maximum value of the relative correction can reach @xmath147 which is larger than that of minimal supersymmetric model and comparable with the qcd correction .",
    "such tc2 correction should be observable at future high energy colliders .",
    "we also study the tc2 correction to the branching ratio of top quark decaying into different polarized w boson states and find the relative tc2 correction is below @xmath148 .",
