    "the morphism @xmath12 is not an isomorphism unless @xmath13 or @xmath0 has good reduction ( i.e. , @xmath6 is an abelian @xmath2-scheme ) .",
    "one would like to understand the properties of the morphism @xmath12 , and thus how the nron model of @xmath0 behaves under base change .    in @xcite , edixhoven constructed a filtration on the special fiber @xmath14 of @xmath6 by closed subgroups that measures the behaviour of the nron model under _ tame _ extensions of the base field @xmath3 , that is , finite extensions of degree prime to the characteristic exponent @xmath5 of @xmath4 .",
    "this filtration is indexed by rational numbers in the semi - open interval @xmath15 .",
    "the numbers in @xmath15 where this filtration jumps form an interesting set of invariants of @xmath0 ; we will simply refer to these numbers as the jumps of @xmath0 .",
    "note that , by definition , these jumps are _ real _ numbers .",
    "the question whether they are always rational is one of the main open problems about these invariants .",
    "let @xmath16 be a separable closure of @xmath3 .",
    "by grothendieck s semi - stable reduction theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ix.3.6 ) there exists a smallest finite extension @xmath17 of @xmath3 in @xmath16 such that the abelian variety @xmath18 has semi - stable reduction ; this means that the identity component of the special fiber of the nron model of @xmath18 is an extension of an abelian @xmath4-variety by an algebraic @xmath4-torus .",
    "we say that @xmath0 is tamely ramified if @xmath17 is a tame extension of @xmath3 , and wildly ramified otherwise .",
    "when @xmath0 is tamely ramified , edixhoven explained how the jumps of @xmath0 can be computed from the action of the galois group @xmath19 on the nron model of @xmath18 .",
    "this description implies in particular that the jumps are rational and that the degree of @xmath17 over @xmath3 is the least common multiple of their denominators .",
    "in this paper we are mainly interested in the wildly ramified case .",
    "we will study the jumps of @xmath0 under the assumption that @xmath0 is the jacobian of a @xmath3-curve @xmath1 .",
    "in this case , it was already proven by the second author in @xcite that the jumps are rational ; see also @xcite .",
    "in fact , he proved a much stronger result , namely that the jumps of @xmath0 only depend on the combinatorial reduction data of @xmath1 , and not on the characteristic of @xmath4 .",
    "a result of winters @xcite guarantees that we can always find a curve @xmath20 over the field of complex laurent series @xmath21 with the same reduction data , and thus the same jumps , as @xmath1 .",
    "since @xmath20 is automatically tame , it follows that the jumps of @xmath1 are rational . by corollary 3.1.5 in chapter 5 of @xcite , the least common multiple of their denominators",
    "is the so - called _ stabilization index _ of @xmath1 , a combinatorial invariant whose definition we will recall in .",
    "this result is quite powerful , but the proof of the rationality of the jumps is somewhat indirect , since one uses the combinatorial nature of the jumps and winters s result to reduce to the case where the residue field @xmath4 has characteristic zero .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to give an interpretation of the jumps of @xmath0 in terms of lattices of logarithmic differential forms on @xmath2-models of @xmath1 ( theorems [ thm - logtame ] and [ thm - logdescr ] ) , and to deduce a direct proof of their rationality ( theorem [ thm - rat ] ) .",
    "very roughly , we show that the jumps are controlled by the so - called _ saturation _ of a log regular model of @xmath1 .",
    "the saturation is essentially equivalent to a semi - stable model in the tamely ramified case , but not in general ; it can be viewed as a kind of combinatorial ( characteristic - free ) approximation of a semi - stable model .",
    "we expect that this approach can be generalized to arbitrary abelian @xmath3-varieties , provided that one finds a good notion of logarithmic nron model of @xmath0 . to our knowledge ,",
    "such a construction has not yet appeared in the literature .",
    "using our logarithmic interpretation of the jumps , we then establish an explicit and compact formula for the jumps of @xmath0 in terms of the combinatorial reduction data of @xmath1 ( theorem [ theorem - formula ] ) .",
    "such a formula was not known before .",
    "it allows to prove directly that the stabilization index @xmath22 is the least common multiple of the denominators of the jumps ( corollary [ cor - lcm ] ) , without relying on winters s result .",
    "we also deduce some interesting new properties of the jumps that make it easy to compute them in concrete examples ( propositions [ prop - lowbound ] and [ prop - princ ] ) .",
    "our methods give a conceptual explanation of the role that is played by the stabilization index of @xmath1 : it is the smallest possible saturation index of a log regular model of @xmath1 ( see corollary [ cor - stab ] ) .",
    "our formula and the properties we deduce from it are somewhat reminiscent of jumping numbers of multiplier ideals of divisors on surfaces , but we do not know if there are any direct connections .",
