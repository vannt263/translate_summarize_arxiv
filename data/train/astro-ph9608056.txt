    "the luminosity function of galaxies is a simple but fundamentally important quantity in the study of galaxy populations and their evolution .",
    "the luminosity function is of particular relevance to the problem of the excess counts of faint blue galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) and will provide important constraints toward the resolution of this question .",
    "in particular , accurate determinations of the luminosity function at both low and high redshifts are crucial .",
    "large wide - angle redshift surveys are providing precise measurements of the luminosity function in the local @xmath11 universe ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , a necessary baseline on which to anchor models of galaxy evolution back to higher redshifts .",
    "also , recent smaller but deeper redshift surveys have provided direct measurements of the luminosity function to redshifts @xmath12 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and have revealed clear evidence for the evolution of the luminosity function with lookback time . moreover , that evolution depends strongly on galaxy type , such that the luminosity density of blue , star - forming galaxies appears to have increased substantially by @xmath13 , whereas that of red , more quiescent galaxies appears to have changed relatively little .    in this paper",
    "we present the luminosity function for a sample of field galaxies obtained as part of the canadian network for observational cosmology cluster redshift survey ( cnoc1 ) .",
    "although the cnoc1 survey was optimized for obtaining cluster galaxy redshifts , a concurrent sample of field galaxies was an important and necessary component needed in order to accomplish the main survey goal of an accurate measurment of @xmath14 from cluster dynamics ( @xcite ) .",
    "the 389 galaxies in the cnoc1 field sample considered in this paper span the redshift range @xmath15 , and our sample size is comparable to that of other surveys at these intermediate redshifts .",
    "moreover , available color information allows us to subdivide our sample by galaxy type .",
    "the aim of this paper is to compute the luminosity function for the cnoc1 field galaxies and to compare our results to those from other intermediate - redshift surveys .",
    "we describe the cnoc1 data sample in   [ data ] and detail our methods in   [ methods ] .",
    "our luminosity function results are then presented and discussed in   [ results ] .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in   [ conclusions ] .",
    "the cnoc1 cluster redshift survey contains about 2600 velocities of cluster and field galaxies , observed in the fields of 16 high x - ray luminosity clusters spanning the redshift range @xmath16 .",
    "photometric and spectroscopic observations were obtained using the multi - object spectrograph ( mos ) at the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) during 24 nights in 1993 and 1994 .",
    "a detailed description of the observational and data reduction techniques is given in yee , ellingson , & carlberg ( 1996 ; hereafter yec ) ; here we briefly describe some relevant details .",
    "the cnoc1 field sample used in this paper is defined to lie within the redshift limits @xmath17 , and outside the individual cnoc1 cluster redshift limits given in table  1 of carlberg et al .",
    "in addition , further redshift limits are introduced by the use of four band - limiting filters , designed to optimize galaxy spectroscopy for clusters in different redshift ranges ( yec ) . for each filter , we set the low redshift limit where [ oii ] @xmath18 would be 50   from the filter s blue end , and we set the high redshift limit where g - band would be 150   from the filter s red end .",
    "( note our high redshift filter limits are more conservative than the corresponding limits given in yec , which were based on detectability of ca h+k .",
    "the addition of g - band here and the resulting more stringent limits should minimize the effect of any possible incompleteness at the high-@xmath19 ends of the filters , which we are still investigating . ) selection of objects for spectroscopy was based on gunn @xmath3 magnitudes ( @xcite ) . in order to optimize the number of cluster redshifts , the fraction of galaxies spectroscopically observed was designed to decline with apparent magnitude .",
    "thus a magnitude selection weight @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 is the fraction of objects with redshifts at a given apparent magnitude ; see yec ) is assigned to each galaxy to properly weight its contribution in any statistical analyses ( see below ) . in this paper",
    "we limit the sample to apparent magnitudes for which @xmath22 .",
    "gunn @xmath23 magnitudes are also derived for each galaxy , and we further use a color selection weight @xmath24 ( @xcite ) to remove any residual color - dependent spectroscopic sampling effects not accounted for by the main magnitude selection weight . however , our results are little changed by inclusion of @xmath25 .",
    "we use the observed @xmath26 colors and interpolation among model galaxy spectral energy distributions ( @xcite ) to derive rest - frame colors and appropriate @xmath27-corrections for determination of absolute magnitudes @xmath28 , in both the gunn @xmath3 and @xmath6 ( @xcite ) systems .",
    "( for this purpose , we also need the transformations @xmath29 and @xmath30 given by fukugita et al .  1995 . ) throughout this paper we adopt a deceleration parameter @xmath31 and a hubble constant @xmath32  km  s@xmath33  mpc@xmath33 ; we use @xmath34 if not otherwise indicated . finally , we limit the absolute magnitude range to @xmath35 or @xmath36 , outside of which we have few observed galaxies .",
    "the final field sample consists of 389 galaxies .",
    "table  [ tabsamps ] summarizes the numbers , redshift limits , and apparent magnitude limits of our data sample .",
    "we compute the luminosity function using two related methods which are unbiased by density inhomogeneities in the galaxy distribution .",
    "these are the parametric maximum - likelihood method of sandage , tammann , & yahil ( 1979 ; hereafter sty ) and the non - parametric stepwise maximum - likelihood ( swml ) method of efstathiou , ellis , & peterson ( 1988 ; hereafter eep ) .",

    "then the probability that galaxy @xmath37 has absolute magnitude @xmath43 is given by @xmath44}_{\\max[m_{\\rm min}(z_i ) , m_1 ] }                       \\phi(m ) dm \\right .",

    "[ data ] : @xmath52 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the sty method",
    "one assumes a parametric model for @xmath42 , and the parameters describing @xmath42 are determined by maximizing the likelihood @xmath47 , or equivalently @xmath53 , with respect to those parameters . in our case",
    "we take as our model for @xmath42 the schechter function ( @xcite ) @xmath54^{1+\\alpha } \\",
    "\\exp [ -10^{0.4(m^*-m ) } ] \\ , \\ ] ] and use the sty method to find the characteristic magnitude @xmath55 and the faint - end slope @xmath56 .",
    "we emphasize that in the sty method , the determination of @xmath55 and @xmath56 are unbiased by the presence of galaxy density fluctuations in the survey , unlike the case for traditional least - squares luminosity function estimators ( e.g. , @xcite ) . on the other hand , the normalization @xmath57 drops out in equation  ( [ eqprob ] ) and has to be determined separately as described below .",
    "error ellipses in the @xmath55-@xmath56 plane may be drawn by finding the contour corresponding to @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the change in @xmath60 appropriate for the desired confidence level and for a @xmath60 distribution with 2 degrees of freedom ( e.g. , @xmath61 at @xmath62 confidence ) .",
    "alternatively , one does not have to assume a particular functional form for @xmath42 .",
    "rather , in the eep stepwise maximum likelihood method ( swml ) , the luminosity function is taken to be a series of @xmath63 steps , each of width @xmath64 in absolute magnitude : @xmath65 here the likelihood is maximized with respect to the @xmath66 , which are solved for via an iterative procedure .",
    "also , we can estimate the variances of the @xmath66 by calculating the diagonal elements of an appropriate covariance matrix .",
    "see eep for details of the procedures used to estimate the @xmath66 and their errors .    to calculate the normalization @xmath57 of the schechter function ( [ eqschech ] ) , as well as the mean galaxy number density @xmath67 , we do the following .",

    "we use bootstrap resampling ( e.g. , @xcite ) to estimate the errors on @xmath67 and @xmath57 contributed by uncertainties from fitting @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and from sampling and weighting fluctuations . this method does not include errors arising from galaxy density fluctuations , which we instead estimate using an appropriate integral over the galaxy clustering power spectrum @xmath76 : @xmath77 here @xmath71 denotes the volume of the particular sample under consideration , and @xmath78 is the window function for that volume , defined by @xmath79 ( that is , in @xmath71 we explicitly account for the `` pencil - beam '' geometry of the cnoc1 fields . ) for @xmath76 we adopt the local result derived from a 19000-galaxy sample drawn from the las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs ; @xcite ) , but multiplied by @xmath80 to account for linear evolution ( e.g. , @xcite , pp .",
    "528 - 529 ) at the higher redshifts sampled in cnoc1 .",

    "also , note that our survey apparent flux limits prevent us from measuring the luminosity function fainter than our chosen @xmath86 ( c.f .",
    "end of   [ data ] ) .",
    "we estimate errors on @xmath81 with the same method used on @xmath57 and @xmath67 .    we have thus far neglected the effects of photometric errors .",
    "this is actually a reasonable simplification , as @xmath90 of our sample galaxies have estimated errors of @xmath91 mag . assuming a gaussian magnitude error distribution with dispersion @xmath92 mag",
    ", we can correct for the effects of photometric errors on the luminosity function using the method described in eep   3.5 .",
    "we find that neglecting photometric errors only biases @xmath55 and @xmath56 by at most @xmath93 and @xmath94 , much smaller than our 1@xmath95 uncertainties ( table  [ tablf ] ) .",
    "we can thus safely neglect the effects of photometric errors in the rest of this paper .",
    "finally , note that for galaxies within our adopted filter redshift limits , the magnitude selection weights @xmath20 will be slight _ over_estimates , for the following reason . recall that @xmath20 is basically the ratio ( at a given apparent magnitude @xmath96 ) of the total number of galaxies to the number of galaxies with redshifts .",
    "however , since we include galaxies both inside and outside the filter redshift limits when computing this ratio , and since the redshift success rate will be lower for galaxies outside the filter limits than for those inside , @xmath20 will be overestimated for those galaxies inside the limits .",
    "the amount of overestimate can be approximately calculated once some simplifying assumptions are made .",
    "we adopt specific values for @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( those we find below in   [ results ] ; we further assume that the luminosity function does not change with redshift ) , and we take our redshift sampling rate to be some constant within a given set of filter redshift limits .",
    "it turns out that the effect is approximately independent of apparent magnitude , so that the luminosity function shape is not affected .",
    "the luminosity function normalization will , however , be too large by roughly @xmath97% for our adopted filter limits , where the uncertainty represents the range of scatter observed for different apparent magnitudes and filters .",
    "we do not explicitly include this systematic correction in our luminosity function normalizations , as it is comparable to our random errors , as well as somewhat complicated to deal with exactly ( e.g. , we need to model the change of luminosity function with redshift , as well as iterate the luminosity function and `` renormalization '' calculations until convergence ) .",
    "however , we will need to keep the approximate 20% correction in mind when comparing our results to those of other surveys , as we do below .",
    "our luminosity function fit results are given in table  [ tablf ] , for both rest - frame gunn @xmath3 and rest - frame @xmath6 .",
    "figures  [ figcontrbred ] and [ figcontrbblue ] show the @xmath62 error ellipses in the @xmath55 and @xmath56 parameters , and figures  [ figphimrb ] and [ figphimcfrs ] plot the actual luminosity functions @xmath42 .",
    "the results are shown for the full 389 galaxy sample , as well as for two subsamples of galaxies whose rest - frame colors are either redder ( 209 galaxies ) or bluer ( 180 galaxies ) than that of an sbc galaxy ( model of @xcite ) .",
    "overall , the full sample luminosity functions have schechter parameters @xmath98 and @xmath99 in gunn @xmath3 , and @xmath100 and @xmath101 in @xmath6 .",
    "note the clear distinction between the red- and blue - subsample luminosity functions shown in figures  [ figphimrb ] and [ figphimcfrs ] : the red subsample has a shallow @xmath102 and dominates the galaxy population at the bright end ( @xmath103 ) , while the blue subsample has a much steeper @xmath104 to @xmath105 , and consequently dominates at the faint end ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "the error ellipses for the red and blue subsamples are clearly separated for both gunn @xmath3 and @xmath6 , as seen in figures  [ figcontrbred ] and [ figcontrbblue ] , respectively .",
    "we next compare our results against those from the two other largest surveys with @xmath107-band luminosity functions available at comparable intermediate redshifts , specifically the canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs ; @xcite ) and the autofib redshift survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "we start with the cfrs . in figures",
    "[ figcontrbblue ] and  [ figphimcfrs ] we plot the cfrs @xmath6-band results for a sample of 208 galaxies in their @xmath108 bin ( their `` best '' estimates ) .",
    "the cfrs sample has also been divided into red and blue subsamples at the same sbc color cut used in cnoc1 , and we show the corresponding results as well .",
    "note first from figure  [ figcontrbblue ] that the cfrs @xmath55 and @xmath56 values are just outside the respective cnoc1 @xmath62 error ellipses . remembering that the corresponding cfrs error ellipses will be larger ( the cfrs sample is about half the size of cnoc1 )",
    ", we find that the cnoc1 and cfrs @xmath55 and @xmath56 values agree at better than the 2@xmath95 level for each of the all , red , and blue samples .",
    "however , when we plot the actual luminosity functions in figure  [ figphimcfrs ] , we find that although the _ shapes _",
    "( i.e. , @xmath56 ) of corresponding cnoc1 and cfrs luminosity functions agree fairly well , the cnoc1 results tend to show brighter @xmath55 values and higher normalizations , especially in the case of the blue subsample . recall that the cnoc1 normalization is likely an upper bound and may have to be decreased by about 20% , which would help improve the match with cfrs .",
    "an additional decrease in the cnoc1 @xmath55 by 0.2 mag ( cf .",
    "figure  [ figcontrbblue ] ) would be needed to bring the cnoc1 and cfrs full - sample luminosity functions into very close agreement .",
    "we consider next some possible causes for the differences , though none of them are entirely satisfactory .",
    "extinction , which has been neglected in our analysis , should only have a small effect ( as our photometry was in the @xmath3-band ) and would actually brighten our @xmath55 values .",
    "large - scale structure may bias the cnoc1 normalization high , as our field samples are in the neighborhood of rich clusters .",
    "however , we find that our results are little changed even when we triple the adopted cluster redshift limits ( from about @xmath109  km  s@xmath33 to @xmath110  km  s@xmath33 from the cluster centers ) in order to reduce the effects from potential large - scale structure associated with the clusters",
    ". moreover , one expects the discrepancies to be larger for red galaxies ( as they are more common in dense environments ) , but the observed differences are actually larger for blue galaxies . also , the choice of spectral energy distributions used here to calculate @xmath27-corrections and to make the red / blue cuts is the same as that in cfrs .",
    "we also verified that we could reproduce the cfrs luminosity function results using our code on their redshift catalog data .",
    "a final possibility is that there remains some unaccounted systematic offset of order 0.2 mag in the photometry zero - points , arising from the completely independent ways the photometry was obtained and reduced in the two surveys . in the end",
    ", the differences may simply reflect actual sampling fluctuations .",
    "it is nevertheless encouraging that the luminosity function shapes of corresponding cnoc1 and cfrs samples are quite similar .",
    "also , even before the 20% correction to the cnoc1 normalization , the luminosity densities from the two surveys do not differ at more than the 2@xmath95 level ( see also below ) .",
    "overall the cnoc1 and cfrs results are roughly consistent , showing the same luminosity function shapes , but with normalization and @xmath55 differences , both at about the 20% level .",
    "we note that the cnoc1 sample provides somewhat better luminosity function measurements in the range @xmath0 because of its larger sample size . on the other hand , the _ full _ cfrs sample extends to @xmath12 and provides a longer baseline for studying the evolution of red and blue galaxy luminosity functions , a point we return to below .",
    "next , in figures  [ figcontrbblue ] and [ figphimauto ] we compare our results against the @xmath111 and @xmath112 luminosity functions from the autofib survey .",
    "( the autofib survey results are in the @xmath113 system , which is close enough to @xmath6 that we will not apply any zero - point corrections ; cf .",
    "also , there are no results for red and blue subsamples . ) here the agreement is worse than it was with cfrs . both autofib samples show steeper faint - end slopes than those of cnoc1 and cfrs .",
    "the @xmath55 and @xmath56 values are discrepant at the 2 to 3@xmath95 level compared to cnoc1 ( the corresponding error ellipse for the autofib @xmath111 sample is smaller than that of the cnoc1 all sample , while that for @xmath112 is comparable in size to that of cnoc1 ; see figure  11 of @xcite ) .",
    "examination of figure  [ figphimauto ] shows that the cnoc1 , autofib , and cfrs luminosity functions are only broadly consistent with each other , with autofib samples showing the steepest slopes and lowest normalizations .",
    "it is curious that the autofib results actually resemble that of our blue subsample well ( though this is _ not _ to suggest that they are incomplete in red galaxies ) .",
    "some of the same points raised above in discussing the cnoc1 and cfrs differences apply here as well . also , though the autofib sample is the largest among the three surveys , there are some differences in their survey construction compared to cnoc1 and cfrs .",
    "unlike cnoc1 or cfrs , the autofib sample is actually a combination of a number of disparate redshift surveys , carried out with different instruments and telescopes . instead of ccd photometry",
    ", the autofib survey is based on photographic plate photometry .",
    "also , the original photometry is in the @xmath113 band , rather than at longer wavelengths like @xmath3 ( cnoc1 ) or @xmath114 ( cfrs ) .",
    "consequently the @xmath27-corrections needed to convert to rest - frame @xmath107 are largest for the autofib samples .",
    "ellis et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and references therein detail a careful treatment of these various issues . while we do not claim that any of these is the cause of the luminosity function differences",
    ", we do suggest that the details of the construction and selection of galaxy samples from one survey to another are complicated enough that they may systematically affect comparison of results among different samples .",
    "the less than ideal agreement shown in figure  [ figphimauto ] indicates that even larger samples , with well - defined selection criteria , are needed to make a definitive determination of the luminosity function at intermediate redshifts .",
    "now , we proceed to examine the issue of galaxy evolution within the cnoc1 sample .",
    "we have divided the cnoc1 samples by redshift to look for changes in @xmath55 and @xmath56 as a function of @xmath19 .",
    "we find there to be no significant changes in @xmath55 or @xmath56 with redshift , within the respective @xmath62 error ellipses of the @xmath19-divided samples .",
    "this holds for the full sample , as well as for the red and blue galaxy subsamples .",
    "however , because the error ellipses do get quite large when the redshift cuts are applied , we are not able to rule out ( or in ) changes in @xmath55 of order 0.5 magnitude over @xmath115",
    ".    we will instead examine changes in the galaxy luminosity density @xmath81 as a function of @xmath19 , and adopt the simple procedure of fixing @xmath55 and @xmath56 at the values given in table  [ tablf ] for all @xmath19 .",
    "we plot the @xmath6-band luminosity density @xmath81 vs. @xmath19 in four redshift bins in figure  [ figld ] , for the all , red , and blue samples .",
    "( to facilitate comparison with other surveys , we have rescaled our @xmath81 results for @xmath116 to @xmath117 ; recall equation  [ [ eqsl ] ] . )",
    "the errors plotted are @xmath118 estimates as described in   [ methods ] , with roughly equal contributions from bootstrap resampling and density fluctuation uncertainties .",
    "we see from the figure that @xmath81 for the full sample rises at higher @xmath19 , and that this increase is caused predominantly by the blue galaxy population .",
    "the red sample @xmath81 does not exhibit a trend with redshift , while the blue sample @xmath81 rises steadily with @xmath19 .",
    "if we use just two bins ( for simplicity ) , @xmath119 and @xmath120 , the red galaxy @xmath81 in the high-@xmath19 bin is just 10% more than that in the low-@xmath19 bin , while the blue galaxy @xmath81 nearly triples , albeit with large errors .",
    "these results may be directly compared to the luminosity density vs. redshift results derived from the cfrs ( @xcite ) which we also show in figure  [ figld ] .",
    "we find that the _ shapes _ of the cnoc1 @xmath81 vs. @xmath19 relation are fairly similar to the cfrs results , which were derived over a longer redshift baseline .",
    "however , the cnoc1 luminosity densities appear systematically higher , especially for the blue sample .",
    "if we apply the likely 20% normalization reduction for cnoc1 discussed before , the results agree better , as also shown in figure  [ figld ] . in any event ,",
    "the cnoc1 trends are at least qualitatively consistent with those seen in the cfrs : strong evolution of the luminosity density of blue galaxies , but little evolution of that of red galaxies . moreover , schade et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have found that the surface brightness of disk galaxies in the cnoc1 survey increases with @xmath19 in a way consistent with the shape of the cfrs @xmath81-@xmath19 relation ; our current results thus also corroborate the earlier cnoc1 findings .",
    "that the differences between cnoc1 and cfrs lie in the absolute normalizations rather than in the shapes suggests that _ within _ each survey , we are basically measuring the same galaxy luminosity density trends , but that there is some unaccounted systematic normalization or scaling difference , particularly for blue galaxies , which causes the disagreement when we compare _ across _ the two surveys .",
    "we have also checked that our red / blue luminosity function and luminosity density evolution differences are robust to potential errors in assigning galaxies to the red and blue samples ( e.g. , a potential wavelength - dependent error in our model sbc galaxy spectrum can lead to a redshift - dependent type assignment error ) .",
    "we do this check by more finely dividing our sample into three roughly equal parts by color .",
    "we find that the steep faint end of the blue luminosity function and the increase of the blue luminosity density at higher redshift both result primarily from galaxies in the bluest third of our sample , rather than from blue galaxies near the sbc dividing line . in the latter case",
    "our results would have been more sensitive to potential type - assignment errors , but as the former case is the actual situation , our conclusions regarding the red / blue differences should not be affected .",
    "finally , we compare our @xmath3-band results against those from the _ local _ sample of 18,678 las campanas redshift survey ( lcrs ) galaxies , the largest galaxy sample for which the luminosity function has been computed ( @xcite ) .",
    "the lcrs galaxies have an average redshift @xmath121 , and are also observed in the red - band ( details in @xcite and @xcite ) , whose zero - point is within @xmath122 mag of the gunn-@xmath3 system used for cnoc1 . ] . from figures  [ figcontrbred ] and [ figphimrb ] , we find that the local lcrs luminosity function is clearly different from the intermediate redshift cnoc1 results .",
    "the cnoc1 results show a brighter @xmath55 , a steeper faint - end slope @xmath56 , as well as a higher normalization compared to the lcrs .",
    "we note that if the differences result purely from galaxy evolution , that evolution needs to to be luminosity dependent as well , as the differences become larger at the faint end of the luminosity function . in terms of luminosity densities ,",
    "the lcrs has @xmath123",
    "mpc@xmath124 , about half that of the cnoc1 sample .",
    "the increase in luminosity density at intermediate redshifts relative to the local value appears to be a robust conclusion , as the cnoc1 results are corroborated by independent samples like cfrs and autofib ( despite the differences among the intermediate - redshift samples ) .",
    "however , a careful consideration and account of systematic effects will be especially important for a definitive assessment of the causes of the differences .",
    "for example , different surface brightness limits of local vs. deeper surveys ( @xcite ) , or different photometry methods ( different aperture sizes , limiting isophotes , etc . ) can cause differences in the luminosity function that have nothing to do with actual galaxy evolution .",
    "though beyond the scope of this paper , such a detailed modelling of both evolutionary and observational effects is planned for the ongoing cnoc2 redshift survey , a successor of cnoc1 , which should eventually provide a much larger sample of several thousand intermediate redshift field galaxies for study .",
    "we have computed the rest - frame gunn @xmath3 and @xmath6 luminosity functions for a sample of 389 field galaxies from the cnoc1 redshift survey , over the redshift range @xmath0 .",
    "we find schechter parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 in gunn @xmath3 , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 in @xmath6 .",
    "samples of red and blue galaxies , cut at the rest - frame @xmath26 color of an sbc galaxy , show distinctly different luminosity functions .",
    "red galaxies have a shallow slope @xmath7 and dominate the bright end of the luminosity function , while blue galaxies have a steep @xmath8 and prevail at the faint end .",
    "table  [ tablf ] summarizes our results .",
    "comparisons of the cnoc1 results to independently - determined intermediate - redshift luminosity functions show broad agreement with results from the cfrs and autofib redshift surveys . however , there are questions about particular differences in the luminosity functions which will require larger samples to resolve .",
    "calculation of the @xmath6-band luminosity density shows that the cnoc1 red galaxy luminosity density is about the same from @xmath0 , but that the blue luminosity density over @xmath120 is nearly three times that for @xmath119 .",
    "these trends are consistent with those derived from the cfrs ( see figure  [ figld ] ) , except for a normalization difference resulting primarily from blue galaxies , and are also consistent with the redshift evolution of disk galaxy surface brightness observed in cnoc1 .",
    "comparison to the local luminosity function from the las campanas redshift survey implies that the luminosity density at @xmath9 is only about half that seen at @xmath10 .",
    "also , luminosity - dependent evolution , increasing at the faint end , would seem to be required to match the cnoc1 and lcrs luminosity functions , if galaxy evolution is the sole cause of the differences seen .",
    "however , an underlying caveat throughout our comparisons of cnoc1 results with those of other surveys is that the particular details of the construction of different surveys may have an important effect on how we interpret the results . along these lines",
    ", we have pointed out some potential systematic causes of the differences among the various survey luminosity functions we considered , though we have not attempted a detailed investigation .",
    "it is probably fair to say that control of systematic effects within a single survey is simpler than across different surveys , and perhaps that is why the red / blue luminosity density trends appear to have the same shapes but different normalizations in cnoc1 and cfrs . in any event ,",
    "the cnoc1 field sample is still relatively small , and a larger sample will definitely help confirm or reject some of the trends that we have seen in cnoc1 , as well as help resolve the differences seen vs. other surveys . in particular , the cnoc2 field redshift survey should provide us with an order of magnitude larger sample of several thousand objects to examine the luminosity and other properties of galaxies at intermediate redshifts .",
    "we thus anticipate a similar but more detailed analysis for the cnoc2 data in the near future , and a thorough investigation of the evolution of galaxies from intermediate to low redshifts .",
    "we thank the many cnoc team members who participated in the observation and reduction of data for the survey .",
    "we thank simon lilly and david schade for helpful discussions and for providing spectral energy distributions and related information .",
    "we also thank the referee david koo for helpful suggestions .",
