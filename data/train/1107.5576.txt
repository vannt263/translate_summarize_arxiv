    "moreover , the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of radio galaxies detected at gev and vhe , being misaligned by large ( @xmath6 angles to the jet axis and thought to be the parent population of blazars in geometrical unification scenarios @xcite , are helping to reveal the blazar jet geometry .",

    "we discuss observable signals produced in the source and calculate those generated outside the source from both @xmath2 rays and uhecrs escaping from the jet accelerator and passing through the @xmath10  mpc - scale regions of cosmic structure , magnetized clusters and filaments , and the larger @xmath11 mpc - scale voids of intergalactic space .",
    "for some apparently non - variable tev blazars , where the one - zone synchrotron / ssc model typically requires extreme parameters for fits , the cascade radiation can be a crucial component of the high - energy radiation spectrum , depending on the strength of the intergalactic magnetic field ( igmf ) in voids , as has recently been proposed to explain the @xmath2-ray spectra of some extreme blazars such as 1es 0229 + 200  @xcite .",

    "each component is characterized by the peak synchrotron flux @xmath23 at peak synchrotron photon energy @xmath24 , and the peak ic flux @xmath25 at peak ic energy @xmath26 , respectively .",

    "heavier nuclei can , however , be accelerated up to ultra - high energies .",
    "the composition of uhecrs is an open question , with both proton and heavy - ion dominated compositions having been claimed to be compatible with hires  @xcite and the pierre auger observatory ( pao )  @xcite data , respectively . as seen here",
    ", the standard model for @xmath2-ray emission from bl lac objects and fr - i radio galaxies suggests a transition from proton to heavy - ion dominated composition at @xmath75  ev .",
    "we have assumed that @xmath2 rays from tev blazars and radio galaxies are from leptonic compton scattering in order that synchrotron theory can be used to derive the various parameters .",
    "thus the hadronic @xmath2-ray flux must be considerably smaller for a consistent interpretation .",
    "sufficiently high - energy protons and nuclei interact with synchrotron photons in the jet via the photomeson process , with photopion production efficiency @xmath76 for cosmic - ray protons estimated to be  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "ev becomes of order @xmath83 , which suggests that the photomeson process is inefficient for this kind of blazar ( though it could be more efficient for low - peaked bl lac objects and fsrqs ) .",
    "the efficiency can also be higher if @xmath65 is lower , provided that @xmath65 is consistent with synchrotron / ssc model fits and minimum lorentz factor estimates inferred from , e.g. , @xmath84 opacity arguments .    roughly , half of the pions produced by photomeson production are charged , and each neutrino carries @xmath85 of the pion energy , so the total ( isotropic - equivalent ) neutrino luminosity at given @xmath86 is estimated to be @xmath87 for a source satisfying @xmath88 like bl lac objects , where @xmath89 is used .",
    "then , one finds that the neutrino flux from an individual source is typically too low to be detected with icecube .",
    "one can also see that the cumulative background flux from high - peaked bl lac objects is low .",
    "the uhecr energy input in the local universe is @xmath90 at @xmath0  ev  @xcite , so that assuming that such bl lac objects and fr - i galaxies are the main uhecr sources , the expected cumulative muon neutrino background flux is estimated to be  @xcite @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the cosmic - ray spectral index and @xmath93 is a pre - factor coming from the redshift evolution of the sources .",
    "low photomeson production efficiencies also follow if the uhecrs are heavy nuclei , whose losses are dominated by photodisintegration ( see below ) .",
    "more luminous blazars , including low - peaked bl lac objects , may however lead to higher photomeson production efficiencies , so that the cumulative neutrino background could be dominated by this class of agn  @xcite .",
    "our evaluation is based on the standard synchrotron / ssc model for bl lac objects and fr - i radio galaxies .",
    "one could abandon the standard synchrotron / ssc model and consider a highly magnetized , @xmath94  g jet model , which is needed in hadronic blazar models to accelerate protons to @xmath1  ev  @xcite .",

    "@xmath2-ray emission is attributed to proton synchrotron radiation and/or proton - induced cascade emission , which leads to the requirement that the uhecr luminosity is @xmath97 . in the proton synchrotron blazar model  @xcite , which is typically viable for high - peaked bl lac objects ,",
    "proton synchrotron radiation is emitted up to energies @xmath98  tev ( in the limit that the maximum energy is determined by the synchrotron cooling ) in efficient fermi acceleration scenarios .",
    "the photomeson production efficiency for protons is strongly dependent on @xmath41 , but the condition @xmath99 suggests that the synchrotron energy - loss is dominant at ultra - high energies where the proton synchrotron radiation is typically prominent at @xmath10  tev energies ( though the photohadronic cascade component may become relevant at lower energies ) .",
    "the strong magnetic field also suppresses electronic ssc emission because fewer electrons are needed to generate the same synchrotron flux .",
    "if the standard synchrotron / ssc scenario holds for tev blazars and their misaligned counterparts , then the protons can hardly reach @xmath100  ev , as shown in table 2 ( see @xmath53 obtained by detailed modeling in the literature ) . for bl lac objects and fr - i galaxies to be the steady sources of uhecrs , therefore , uhecrs would primarily be heavier nuclei .",
    "in such a scenario , one has to examine whether ions can survive photodisintegration losses  ( cf . * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the photodisintegration opacity is estimated similarly to the photomeson production efficiency . approximating the photodisintegration cross section by the giant dipole resonance ( gdr )",

    "then we numerically find @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the energy of a nucleus that typically interacts with a photon with @xmath24 .",
    "hence , heavy nuclei with @xmath112  ev ( given in the observer frame ) undergo some photodisintegration reactions unless @xmath41 is high enough",
    ". the nucleus survival condition @xmath113 gives @xmath114 ( for @xmath115 ) , but significant photodisintegration loss is easily avoided for reasonably large bulk outflow doppler factors .",
    "recalling from equation  ( [ fpgamma ] ) that the photomeson production efficiency has the same dependence on @xmath41 , we can conclude that when heavy nuclei survive photodisintegration , the photomeson production efficiency is so low that the corresponding neutrino and @xmath2-ray fluxes are not easily detected  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* but see also murase & beacom 2010b ) .",
    "the @xmath84 opacity argument allows us to place constraints on @xmath41 in bl lac objects observed at tev energies , and requires @xmath116 for pks 2155 - 304  @xcite for the major july / august 2006 tev flares  @xcite , and @xmath117 to be furthermore consistent with synchrotron / ssc model fitting for different models of the extragalactic background light  ( ebl ; * ? ? ?",
    "another important fact is that vhe photons can interact with the cosmic photon backgrounds .",
    "vhe @xmath2 rays produce electron - positron pairs via @xmath118 pair creation , and the resulting high - energy pairs make high - energy photons via compton scattering .",
    "hence , the cascaded @xmath2 rays , which are often called pair echoes  ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and/or pair haloes  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are expected at gev - tev energies . in particular , @xmath2 rays with energies below @xmath11  tev are likely to leave structured regions of the universe , inducing the cascade in the void region  @xcite .",
    "many @xmath2-ray blazars show variability , and often display spectacular flares .",
    "some of them are ultra - variable , as seen in multi - tev flaring episodes from pks 2155 - 304  @xcite , mrk 501  @xcite and mrk 421  @xcite .",
    "such rapidly varying @xmath2-ray emission should be produced in the blazar region .",
    "this is because the igmf will introduce a significant time spread in the cascade radiation , which seems incompatible with rapidly varying emissions .",
    "for example , consider primary 10 tev @xmath2 rays , so the compton - upscattered cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons have @xmath119 . based on the lower limits of @xmath120  @xcite obtained for 1es 0229 + 200 ( where the term @xmath121 is the coherence length of the magnetic field , and this relation",
    "is understood to apply when @xmath121 is smaller than the cooling length for gev production ) , the timescale of the @xmath122  tev pair echo is estimated to be  @xcite , @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the mean free path for the @xmath118 pair creation , and the void igmf @xmath125 is defined in the frame of the hubble flow .",
    "therefore , the highly variable vhe radiation from these bl lac objects is likely to be either leptonic synchrotron or ssc , or proton synchrotron radiation produced in the jet ( even though another slowly variable component may be produced by the secondary emission ) .",
    "this conclusion does not however hold for a fraction of blazars and radio galaxies from which prominent variability has not been seen .",
    "an interesting source is the extreme tev blazar 1es 0229 + 200 , which has a hard vhe component extending to @xmath126 tev , but has not been reported to be variable in observations taken over a period of @xmath127  yr  @xcite . if the apparent absence of the variability comes from observational limitations and if fast variability is present , the emission should be produced in / near the blazar region .",
    "if it is the case that there is no rapid variability , the observed component may come from an extended jet  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also section 4 for further discussion on the @xmath2-ray emission region ) .",
    "in addition , as we see in this paper , a slowly variable component can be @xmath2-ray - induced intergalactic cascade emission .",
    "furthermore , if it is non - variable , proton - induced intergalactic cascade emission ( i.e. , intergalactic cascades caused by uhe @xmath2 rays and pairs generated via the photomeson production with the cmb and ebl ) can be responsible for the observed emission .",
    "these cascade emissions may confuse interpretation of the minimum bulk lorentz factor from @xmath118 opacity arguments and the level of the ebl  @xcite .",
    "the intergalactic cascade components could be present not only in extreme blazars , but also on longer timescales in other blazars and radio galaxies . for example",
    ", a slowly variable ( @xmath10  month ) emission at gev energies was observed from mrk 501  @xcite , which could arise from the intergalactic cascade induced by variable tev source photons  @xcite .",
    "here we focus on the intergalactic cascade scenarios in order to explain hard vhe spectra of extreme tev blazars whose variability is apparently absent .",
    "we calculate the cascade emission by solving the boltzmann equations , where @xmath118 pair creation , ic scattering , synchrotron radiation , and adiabatic energy loss are taken into account  @xcite . as for proton propagation",
    ", we directly solve the equation of motion of protons one by one , with photomeson production simulated by sophia  @xcite and the bethe - heitler process included to treat interactions with the ambient photon field  @xcite .",

    "furthermore , note that in the case of rare transient activities with short duration @xmath241 and longer quiescent periods @xmath242 $ ] between events , the intergalactic cascade scenario for extreme blazars may not work .",
    "the timescale during which cosmic - ray - induced cascade emission lasts for long time is increased by the factor @xmath243/t_{\\rm dur}$ ] .",
    "then , the cosmic - ray - induced @xmath2-ray flux is consequently reduced by the cosmic - ray and pair - echo induced extension of this emission , and the required cosmic - ray luminosity has to be correspondingly increased , which could make excessive demands on uhecr power .",
    "such a rare transient episode could , however , produce long - lasting though faint cosmic - ray - induced @xmath2-ray emission that lacks associated source emission , in analogous to tev @xmath2-ray - induced cascade radiation  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , for repeating flaring activities with the time interval @xmath244 $ ] , the cosmic - ray - induced cascade emission can be regarded as almost persistent due to contributions from multiple flares .",
    "observational tests of the properties of the extreme tev blazars can reveal the radiation mechanism of bl lac objects and fr - i galaxies and provide a clue to uhecr acceleration , despite the above potential issues .",
    "first , continuing variability searches with veritas , hess , and magic , and future studies with cta are obviously important to determine if the emission must be made in the jet .",
    "in addition , discrimination of the uhecr - induced intergalactic cascade from the @xmath2-ray - induced cascade and attenuated source emission is possible from measurements at @xmath245  tev energies .",
    "detection of high - energy photons above @xmath169  tev from 1es 0229 + 200 or above @xmath10  tev from more distant blazars , which may be realized by future @xmath2-ray detectors such as cta and hawc , would be compelling evidence that this kind of object is a source of uhecrs .",
    "in addition to @xmath2-ray observations , anisotropy searches with uhecr arrival directions provide another interesting test .    in this work we focused on uhecr acceleration in the inner jets of bl lac objects and fr - i galaxies .",
    "note that fsrqs and fr - ii galaxies are rarer but more powerful , and they can also be sources of uhecrs and neutrinos .",
    "other scenarios such as shock acceleration at hot spots  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and cocoon shocks  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are viable for these types of radio - loud agn .",
    "but their local number density , @xmath246 , appears to be too small to avoid strong anisotropy in the local universe  @xcite . in the heavy - ion dominated composition case ,",
    "not only blazars and radio galaxies , but also radio - quiet agn  @xcite could be sources of uhe nuclei .    in summary , we have considered observational implications of bl lac objects and fr - i galaxies as steady sources of uhecrs . within the standard synchrotron ssc model for typical , variable",
    "bl lac objects and misaligned counterparts , acceleration of uhe protons to energies @xmath233  ev is unlikely , so the composition of higher - energy cosmic rays should be dominated by heavy ions within the framework of this model .",
    "the intergalactic cascade emission has to be sub - dominant for highly variable blazars and radio galaxies , while it can play a role on the spectrum of slowly variable or non - variable objects , especially extreme tev blazars .",
    "if the tev spectrum of those blazars is produced by uhecr - induced cascade emission , then structured egmfs , which can significantly isotropize protons , increase the luminosity demands on these sources .",
    "the intergalactic cascade emissions induced by vhe / uhe photons and uhecrs from a distant source can be distinguished by future multi - tev observations from cta and hawc .",
    "in particular , detection of @xmath247  tev photons from relatively low - redshift sources such as 1es 0229 + 200 or @xmath4  tev photons from more distant sources would favor such objects as being sources of uhecrs .",
