    "<S> ( [ eq : yu ] ) , can be obtained similarly : @xmath105 the coupling to the ph excitations makes the infrared divergences stronger ; the most dominant contribution is due to the linearly divergent integral due to the l - mode , and the result grows like @xmath106 . </S>",

    "<S> the resummation also replaces the original coupling constants @xmath110 renormalized at the meson momenta @xmath37 by the running coupling constants @xmath111 at the scale @xmath58 @xcite : before applying redmond s method to avoid the landau ghost @xcite , they are related by the one - loop formulae : for @xmath112 , @xmath113 and similarly for @xmath114 . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : d3 ] ) is enhanced by the growth of @xmath115 .    </S>",
    "<S> our result can be summarized by the behavior of the screening mass in the medium . </S>",
    "<S> the infrared behavior of the @xmath92-mode contribution is governed by the screening mass ( squared ) @xmath116 , which is obtained from the self - energy @xmath117 by letting @xmath118 first followed by @xmath119 ( see eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : vfi])-([eq : yu ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the lorentz invariance guarantees @xmath120 , which would lead to the cancellation between the @xmath81- and @xmath75-mode contributions ( see eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : d1 ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the coupling of the ph excitations breaks the invariance : the @xmath81-mode acquires a nonzero debye screening mass , which is @xmath121 for @xmath64 , but @xmath122 due to baryon current conservation @xcite . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the cancellation between the two modes becomes incomplete , leaving the result of eq . </S>",

    "<S> , the normal state is unstable . in our calculation of the ground - state energy density and the quasiparticle energy we assumed the normal state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath124 , however , this assumption is not valid . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests a stability condition : @xmath125 for a normal fermi liquid , in addition to the wellknown conditions for the dimensionless landau - migdal parameters @xcite . if the ground state is not normal , one should re - compute the energy density self - consistently allowing the possibility of new configurations like the so - called `` fermi - gap '' state : if one literally accepts the results of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fig5 ] , this indicates a 1st order phase transition at @xmath60 from the normal state to the fermi - gap state . ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , as stressed above , the mechanism in our case is beyond the hartree - fock approximation ( recall @xmath102 ) . ] </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the fermi sphere for the normal state , the nucleons occupy the momentum states within the inner sphere and the outer shell for the fermi - gap state . in our model , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath126@xmath127 which would imply the critical density for neutron matter @xmath128 .    we also note another possible scenario : near the critical point @xmath123 , the terms of higher order than we considered here , which would give contributions @xmath129 ( @xmath130 ) , also could be important . it would be a very hard job to compute these contributions . </S>",
    "<S> intuitively , one could regard the result of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : d3 ] ) as the leading approximation of @xmath131 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath59 would not occur for any finite @xmath58 ; @xmath132 asymptotically .    in connection with these scenarios </S>",
    "<S> , we stress that the ( formal ) high - density limit based on the lagrangian ( [ eq : la ] ) does not correspond to the mean - field theory , contrary to the usual claim @xcite : for the first scenario this is obvious ; the second one implies an infinite density of states at the fermi surface for @xmath64 , which never be reached in the mean - field theory . </S>",
    "<S> the usual claim tacitly assumes the absence of infrared singularities , which reflect large long - wavelength fluctuations of the fields , from the higher order corrections . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption leads to the validity of the naive dimension counting , and therefore to the dominance of the mean - field contributions because they contain the largest number of independent fermion loops in each order of the interaction . as discussed above , the effects which lead to the modification of this naive argument are due to the strong infrared behavior induced in the high - density medium .    </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion for the high - density behavior seems to be inevitable for relativistic descriptions : the relevant infrared behavior is due to the ph excitation in the vector channel ( see eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : d1])-([eq : d3 ] ) ) . however , the vector boson degrees of freedom are indispensable to keep matter from collapsing at high density by supplying the repulsion . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that the conclusion might be valid even if the compositeness of hadrons were taken into account : even though the vertex form factors were introduced , they could not influence the results dominated by the contribution from the infrared region ( @xmath37 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> though we have shown the possibility of the fermi - gap state , the transition density @xmath133 appears to be above the critical densities to more familiar new phases like quark matter phase , pion condensed phase , etc . </S>",
    "<S> however , our result was obtained just within a simple model , and @xmath133 is very sensitive even to small corrections , which might be due to higher orders in @xmath0 or other hadronic degrees of freedom like @xmath134 , @xmath135 , etc . </S>",
    "<S> after the inclusion of these effects , the competition or coexistence of the fermi - gap state with more familiar new phases would be an interesting aspect of high - density hadronic matter .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have investigated dynamical effects in high - density nuclear matter due to the higher order many - body correlations . </S>",
    "<S> the anomaly in the fermion spectra , corresponding to the famous effective mass enhancement in nr fermi liquids , grows with increasing density . </S>",
    "<S> the effect is due to the strong infrared behavior caused by the coupling of the ph excitation to the single - particle motion . </S>",
    "<S> the picture of high - density matter emerged from our investigation is much more complicated than the mean - field description . </S>",
    "<S> though a more realistic treatment would be required to fix the relevance to phenomenology , the universal character of this phenomenon already poses various interesting aspects for high - density matter , like the possibility of the fermi - gap state , the thermodynamic properties and transport phenomena in this phase , and the extension to gauge theories . </S>",
