    "in the quantum hall effect @xcite observed in two - dimesional electron systems ( 2des ) in strong magnetic fields , the hall voltage @xmath0 divided by the current @xmath1 is quantized as @xmath2 with @xmath3 an integer .",
    "the distribution of this quantized hall voltage along the width of the 2des has been studied theoretically and experimentally , but has a problem that remains to be solved .",
    "macdonald , rice and brinkman @xcite have studied theoretically the hall - voltage distribution in the ideal 2des with no disorder for integer values of the landau - level filling factor @xmath4 at absolute zero .",
    "they have considered an infinitely - long sample with width @xmath5 in the @xmath6 plane in the magnetic field @xmath7 along the @xmath8 direction ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the 2des considered has a macroscopic size : @xmath5 is much larger than the magnetic length @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) . in this paper",
    "we choose the @xmath12 axis along the current and the @xmath13 axis along the width ( the 2des is in @xmath14 ) . in the ideal 2des with a constant current ,",
    "the electric field along the current @xmath15 is zero and the dissipation is absent .",
    "the hall field @xmath16 induces a shift of each wave function by @xmath17 with @xmath18 ( @xmath19 : the effective mass ) , and the resulting polarization gives the hall charge density @xmath20 .",
    "macdonald et al .",
    "@xcite have obtained the formula for @xmath20 by making the summation of contributions from each of these shifted wave functions .",
    "the same formula is obtained by starting with the polarization or the dipole moment per area which is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the dc dielectric susceptibility ( the superscript 0 means dc ) given by @xmath23 with use of @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , we obtain @xmath26 the electrostatic potential @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) in this equation is given in terms of @xmath20 by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the dielectric constant of the intrinsic semiconductor .",
    "equations ( [ eq : rho_polar ] ) and ( [ eq : long_range_pot ] ) give the hall potential @xmath27 as a function of @xmath13 .",
    "the calculated result @xcite shows that _ the hall voltage is concentrated near edges_.    in the presence of dissipation the hall - voltage distribution changes drastically @xcite .",
    "here we assume that the transport current densities @xmath31 and @xmath32 are related to @xmath15 and @xmath33 by the local dc conductivity tensor @xmath34 , @xmath35 , which has no spatial dependence , that is , @xmath36 the density of the charge accumulated due to the transport , @xmath37 , evolves according to the equation of charge conservation : @xmath38 if we consider a state which is steady and uniform along @xmath12 , the above equation shows that _ the hall field is uniform along the width_. the uniform hall field means a uniform current density , which is along the @xmath12 direction .",
    "such distributions of the hall voltage and the current are those minimizing the total entropy production , which is in accordance with the theorem of the minimum entropy production @xcite .",
    "many other theoretical works have been performed on the hall - voltage and current distributions both in the absence and in the presence of dissipation . in the dissipationless case ,",
    "quantum wires with width comparable to @xmath39 have been studied by calculating the wave function numerically and taking into account @xmath40 in this way @xcite . in several papers @xcite the edge charge due to electrons added to ( and subtracted from ) edge states",
    "was considered .",
    "such edge charge can be described as the charge due to the polarization in eq.([eq : rho_polar ] ) since adding and subtracting electrons in this way is equivalent to shifting the whole electrons by the appropriate distance .",
    "the theory has also been extended to the fractional quantum hall states @xcite . in the dissipative case",
    ", the theory has been extended to a state with compressible and incompressible strips in a slowly - varying confining potential @xcite .",
    "fontein et al .",
    "@xcite have measured the hall potential in a 2-mm - wide 2des formed in a gaas / algaas heterostructure using the linear electro - optic effect . they have observed a crossover of the hall - voltage distribution from the _ concentrated - near - edges _ to the _ uniform _ distribution by increasing the temperature or the current .",
    "this observation suggests that the crossover occurs with increasing the dissipation @xmath41 . at first glance",
    "this seems to contradict the expectation from the above theories : any real systems of macroscopic size should have nonzero dissipation and should show the uniform distribution .",
    "a possible reason for the contradiction may be the difference in angular frequency @xmath42 of current : the theories assumed @xmath43 ( the steady state ) , while the experiment applied ac current of @xmath44hz to employ the lock - in technique .",
    "the theorem of the minimum entropy production @xcite , which leads to the uniform distribution , is applicable only to the case of @xmath45 . in this paper",
    "we study theoretically the hall - voltage distribution in the case of @xmath46 .",
    "the 2des we consider here is uniform except at sharp edges , while a 2des with a slowly - varying confining potential will be studied elsewhere .",
    "the value of the filling factor in the uniform bulk region is not restricted to integers , but we neglect the electron correlation such as in the fractional quantum hall effect by considering a relatively high temperature . in this paper",
    "we study only the incoherent linear transport by employing the local conductivity tensor .",
    "a crossover between coherent and incoherent regimes has been studied theoretically @xcite for the voltage distribution in the 2des with source and drain contacts in strong magnetic fields .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in  2",
    ", we introduce a model and derive an equation for the hall potential as a function of @xmath13 . in  3 , we present an analytical solution for the hall potential when complex conductivities are constant and the interaction is short - ranged . in  4 , we study numerically the hall potential in the long - range interaction as well as in the short - range interaction .",
    "we present our model for the complex conductivities in the edge region , our method of numerical calculation , and calculated results . in  5 ,",
    "conclusions and discussion are given .",
    "in appendix we estimate the value of the complex conductivities .",
    "we assume that the response of the current to the electric field is local .",
    "that is , the current density @xmath47 at the position @xmath48 is determined only by the electric field at the same position @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) : @xmath51 this local relation may be applicable to macroscopic samples where @xmath52 with @xmath53 the phase coherence length , because in this case the length scale of variations of the electric field , which is of the order of @xmath5 , is much larger than @xmath53",
    ". the conductivity @xmath54 in this case can be determined by calculating the uniform - current response to the uniform electric field and taking the average over the random potential with the length scale @xmath55 since we assume here that @xmath56 .",
    "this averaging procedure makes the 2des isotropic in the @xmath6 plane so that we have @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "the spatial dependence of @xmath54 in this paper is due to the decrease of the local electron density as approaching a boundary of the 2des . when @xmath46 , the above relation eq.([eq : acj ] ) can be rewritten , in terms of the polarization @xmath59 and the dielectric susceptibility @xmath60 , as @xmath61 .",
    "now we restrict our discussion to the low - frequency region .",
    "the relevant energy scales in the response to the ac electric field are @xmath62 and the landau - level broadening due to the random potential . by assuming that @xmath63 is much smaller than such energy scales , we expand @xmath64 in a power series of @xmath42 and retain terms up to the first order of @xmath42 .",
    "since the real and imaginary parts of @xmath65 satisfy the following relation : @xmath66 and @xmath67 , we can write @xmath64 as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the dc conductivity and @xmath70 is the dc susceptibility .      in this paper",
    "we consider a 2des with two boundaries which are both parallel to the @xmath12 axis .",
    "we assume that @xmath71 and @xmath72 are uniform along @xmath12 . in the vicinity of the boundaries",
    ", @xmath71 has a @xmath13 dependence , which will be specified in  [ sec : model_for_ydep ] . from the equation of charge conservation , the hall charge density @xmath73 is given by @xmath74 in this equation and in the following",
    ", the @xmath42 dependence of the variables and coefficients will not be shown explicitly . from eq.([eq : acj ] ) , we have @xmath75 here we have also assumed that @xmath15 has no dependence on @xmath13 since @xmath76 when @xmath42 is small .",
    "the above equations show that , when @xmath77 , the @xmath13 dependence of @xmath78 gives the hall charge density @xmath73 and the hall field @xmath33 .",
    "corresponding to the two terms of @xmath71 in eq.([eq : complex_sigma ] ) , @xmath79 has two components : @xmath80 , where @xmath37 is the transport charge density defined by @xmath81 .",

    "the deviation @xmath86 is given by @xmath87 where @xmath88 ( @xmath89 : electron density per unit area ) is the thermodynamic density of states .",
    "the gradient of @xmath90 induces the current and the total current density is given in terms of the gradient of the electrochemical potential ( @xmath91 ) , @xmath92 , as @xmath93 note that @xmath94 and the polarization current is induced only by the electric field .",
    "we have calculated numerically the value of @xmath95 and have obtained @xmath96 , which is also supported by an analytical result below in eq.([eq : nabla_mu ] ) .",
    "therefore we will neglect the term proportional to @xmath95 in the following .",
    "the electrostatic potential due to the hall charge , @xmath27 , in a 2des uniform along @xmath12 is given by @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the potential due to the unit line charge at a distance @xmath99 .",
    "we consider the two models of the electrostatic interaction .",
    "one is the long - range interaction with @xmath100 this is the potential in a dielectric material with the dielectric constant @xmath30 and has been used in the previous work by macdonald et al .",
    "@xcite .",

    "low - frequency admittance has been theoretically studied in the edge - channel picture of quantum hall conductors @xcite , in which the electrochemical potential of an edge channel is equal to that of a contact connected to the channel .",
