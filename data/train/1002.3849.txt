    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are the most energetic explosions in the universe .",
    "past studies have found that grbs consist of ultra - relativistic outflows with collimated jets at cosmological distances .",
    "however , it is not clear how the central engine forms and how the electrons or protons are accelerated in shocks and photons are radiated .",
    "in addition , grbs are quite important as candidates for distance - indicators . owing to their very intense brightness",
    ", grbs can be a powerful tool to measure distances in the high redshift universe .",
    "one of the characteristics of grb prompt emission is the spectral lag , which is the time delay in the arrival of lower - energy emission relative to higher - energy emission .",
    "the previous analyses have been done using a sample of many batse grbs between typical energy bands 25@xmath050 kev and 100@xmath0300 kev , using both ccf ( cross correlation function ; e.g. , @xcite ) and peak - to - peak difference ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "an anti - correlation between the spectral lag and the luminosity exists for the batse grbs above 50 kev energies .",
    "since we can obtain the intrinsic luminosity of grbs from the lag - luminosity relation once we measure the spectral lag , the distance of the grbs can be derived from the observed flux .",
    "but it is not clear whether the relation is valid in wider energy bands .",
    "in addition , from the results of @xcite , it is shown that the spectral lag characterizes each _ pulse _ rather than the entire burst .    from the theoretical point of view ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ", the rise phase timescale may be responsible for the intrinsic pulse width , while the decay phase timescale may be determined by geometrical effects ( e.g. , the curvature effect ) . the curvature effect (",
    ", @xcite , @xcite ) arises from relativistic effects in a sphere expanding with a high bulk lorentz factor @xmath2 = 1/(1 - @xmath3)@xmath4 @xmath5 100 . because of the curvature of the emitting shell , there will be a time delay between the photons emitted simultaneously in the comoving frame from different points on the surface .",
    "however , @xcite showed that the curvature effect alone is not enough to explain energy - dependent pulse properties obtained from the systematic analysis of lag and temporal evolution .",
    "alternative models are the off - axis model proposed by @xcite  and the time - evolution of shock propagation ( @xcite , @xcite , ) may also reproduce the spectral lag and the lag - luminosity relation .",
    "thus , it is not clear that either the curvature effect or other effects cause the spectral lag .",
    "while the curvature effect should necessarily affect the pulse profile , the time - evolution of shock propagation or off - axis model strongly depends on unknown model parameters .    in this paper , in order to unveil the properties of the spectral lag for each pulse",
    ", we investigate the _ hete-2 _ sample with a wider energy range especially at the low - energy end ( @xmath62 kev ) than the batse sample . in sections 2 and 3",
    "we explain the sample selection and the pulse - fit method . in section 4",
    ", we describe the result of the obtained relations between the spectral lag and other observables , and we discuss a detailed energy dependence for the spectral lag in section 5 . finally , we briefly comment on the future prospects in section 6 .",
    "_ hete-2 _ had two scientific instruments on - board which are relevant to our study : the french gamma - ray telescope ( fregate ) , which gave the trigger for grbs and performed spectroscopy over a wide energy range ( 6@xmath0400 kev ) ; and the wide - field x - ray monitor ( wxm ) , which was the key instrument to localize grbs to @xmath510@xmath7 , and sensitive to the 2@xmath025 kev energy range , lower than the fregate one .",
    "the instruments have two types of data .",
    "the survey data were recorded with fixed energy bands and time resolution whenever the instruments were on .",
    "the time - tagged data were produced with a fixed duration ( several minutes ) when the instruments were triggered by bursts . from the time - tagged data , we can produce light curves in arbitrary energy bands , while the batse detector in general created light curves only in fixed energy bands ( although the batse detector actually has time - tagged data , many batse grbs are not fully covered due to the limitation of the memory size for the time - tagged data . ) .",
    "we perform the spectral - lag analysis using a sample of 8 grbs detected by _ hete-2 _ with known or estimated redshifts for the study of the lag - luminosity relation in section [ sec : lag - relation ] .",
    "our selection criteria for the grb samples are the following : 1 ) @xmath8 @xmath6 2 s , where @xmath8 is the observed duration including 90% of the total observed counts , and 2 ) time - tagged data are available . for the latter",
    ", we note that the time - tagged data were lost for some bursts due to downlink problems or invalidation of the instruments ( e.g. , grb030328 , grb030329 etc . ) . for these bursts ,",
    "since the available energy band is too coarse for the survey data ( e.g. , 6@xmath040 kev , 6@xmath080 kev , and 32@xmath0400 kev for fregate ) , we can not conduct a detailed study of the spectral lag . for the analysis in section [ sec : lag - relation ]",
    ", we use the fregate instrument alone because off - axis photon events were partially coded and the number of events detected by the wxm instrument was often small , while the fregate instrument detected more photons compared to those of the wxm instrument due to its relatively large effective area ( @xmath5150 @xmath9 ) ; not all the selected grbs have enough photons to perform the analysis in the wxm energy band .",
    "in addition , for studying the detailed energy dependence of the spectral lag for individual grb pulses in section [ sec : detailed_ene_dep ] , we add 2 grbs without known redshifts having sufficiently non - overlapped pulses to the sample . in this analysis , we use not only the fregate instrument but also the wxm instrument , because some grbs have good enough statistics detected by the wxm instrument . here , since there are not good statistics in the multiple energy bands for grb 020124 and grb 041006 , we exclude the grbs from the sample .",
    "we show the list of 10 grbs in table [ table : hetesample ] and the energy bands in the burst rest frame which are covered by the wxm and fregate instruments for the selected grbs with known redshifts in fig .",
    "[ fig : adoptedenergyband ] .    .grb samples [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table : anal_curvature_hydro ]    note that the bulk lorentz factor @xmath2 is estimated by the lag analysis in fig . [",
    "fig : enevstdec_curvature ] and @xmath10 is the observed duration in the burst rest frame and @xmath11 is the expected intrinsic pulse width from the obtained bulk lorentz factor @xmath2 .",
    "our results suggest that there are correlations between the spectral lag and other observational properties for each grb pulse .",
    "the correlations we found and some additional pulse correlations such as spectral hardness or pulse asymmetry etc . reported by @xcite are important hints to specify or constrain models of grb prompt emission .    on the other hand , because of the large dispersions , the spectral lag relations are not so useful as tools to measure cosmological distances so far , compared with the yonetoku relation .",
    "we should note that there may still be systematic uncertainties in the obtained lags , which may change the correlations as discussed in  4.3.2 . while the obtained lag - luminosity , -@xmath1 and -duration relations can be consistent with a specific model , namely the off - axis model suggested by @xcite , the energy dependences of the spectral lag seem to be consistent with the simple curvature effects for some grb pulses .",
    "the assumptions inferred in @xcite and @xcite are different so that we have discussed the correlations and energy - dependences in the spectral lag with two independent models .",
    "although such methods do not give us a consistent picture for the spectral lag so far , the discussion in this paper may help to determine which models are more appropriate .    for a unified theory to explain the spectral lag and other temporal spectral characteristics",
    ", the effect of the curvature , viewing with an offset angle to the jet , time - evolution of shock propagation , and other effects must be taken into account synthetically and theoretical investigations need to be done . to have further quantitative discussions , we need a sample which includes many grbs having a good s / n ratio detected in a wide band ( kev@xmath0gev ) with observationally known redshifts .",
