    "it is a well known result that the frequencies of a membrane do not change when dirichlet boundary conditions are enforced on a number of isolated points inside the domain of the membrane : this curious result , which at first seems to be at odds with common sense , was first conjectured by lord rayleigh long time ago  @xcite .",
    "more recently this problem has received attention in a number of papers , see for example @xcite . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite wang has obtained a general expression for the correction to the frequencies of a membrane with @xmath1 internal circular regions of infinitesimal radius where no vibration occurrs : these corrections are seen to decay proportionally to @xmath2 , @xmath3 being the radius of the circular cores . in the present paper",
    "we show that these interesting results can be extended to quantum mechanics , at least for non  interacting particles . in section [ sec1 ]",
    "we derive a general formula for the correction to the energies of the schrdinger equation in any number of dimensions , @xmath4 , with @xmath1 internal points of infinitesimal radius , where dirichlet boundary conditions are enforced ( we will refer to these points as to `` piercings '' throught all the paper ) .",
    "the case @xmath5 confirms the logarithmic behaviour of the corrections already observed in the classical membrane vibration countepart , while a power - like behaviour is found for higher dimensions . in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we use the simple harmonic oscillator with a single piercing in the origin ( psho ) as the natural testing ground of the general results obtained : in this case we are able to confirm analytically the predictions of section [ sec1 ] . the case with multiple piercings , on the other hand , is studied numerically , leading to a further confirmation of the results .",
    "an interesting question that may be asked is whether the same conclusions of sections [ sec1 ] and [ sec2 ] can be reached for @xmath1 interacting quantum particles in @xmath0 dimensions : since the problem is clearly too difficult to be attacked on general grounds , we have restricted our attention to a two dimensional parabolic quantum dot , with two electrons , which has been studied in ref .  @xcite . in this case",
    "we have been able to show that , to first order in perturbation theory , the energy of the @xmath6 quantum dot with a piercing in the origin is unchanged for @xmath7 ; on the other hand we have obtained that the leading order finite size correction to the energy is not definite positive and indeed may become negative if the coupling of the coulomb interaction is strong enough .",
    "although the critical coupling where the change in sign occurrs is too large to trust a first order perturbative calculation , we believe that this result opens the question on whether the energy of the ground state of a quantum dot could be lowered adding one or more piercings of small but finite size . in section [ bic ] we have applied our results to the study of open systems supporting a bound state  @xcite , obtaining numerical results for the crossed wire configuration of ref.@xcite which confirm our predictions . in this way",
    "we prove that these bound states survive to the inclusion of piercings , even for piercings of finite extension .",
    "finally , section [ conclu ] contains our conclusions .",

    "( [ eq_2 ] ) : since we expect that the wave function in the presence of piercing be sensibly modified only in the close neighborhood of the points themselves , and the wave functions being normalized , we may argue that @xmath29 . the leading behaviour of the energy for @xmath30 can thus be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq_3 ] ) .    an alternative qualitative  argument to convince the reader of the isospectrality could be the following : consider the wave function ( x_1 ,  , x_d ) = ( x_1,  ,x_d )  ( x_1 ,  , x_d ) [ asym ] where ( x_1 ,  , x_d ) _ i=1^n ^(i)(x_1, ",

    "@xmath32 is the solution in absence of piercing .",
    "we substitute @xmath16 in eq .",
    "( [ sch2 ] ) and we obtain the equation : -  + ( e - e ) ( x_1,  ,x_d ) = 0  .",
    "if we multiply this equation by @xmath16 and integrate over the @xmath0 dimensional volume we have ( e - e ) =  _ d^ * d^dx  .    since the expression in the square brackets is a function which is singular at all the internal points @xmath22 , we expect that the main contribution to the integral comes from these regions . around these points , however , @xmath33 , and therefore we may expect that e = _ d^ * d^dx 0  , implying that @xmath34 .",
    "we can also provide a more direct proof of this statement by considering the special case of a single piercing in two dimensions , which can then be generalized to @xmath1 piercings in @xmath0 dimensions . in this case eq .",
    "( [ asym ] ) reads ( x , y ) = ( x , y )   .",
    "as it stands this expression is not normalized and we should rather write ( x , y ) =  .    if we now take the limit @xmath35,for @xmath36 , we have _ rr_0 ( x , y ) = ( x , y ) which supports the conclusions previously reached .    since the results obtained in this section concern the inclusion of isolated dirichlet points in the @xmath0 dimensional domain where the sse is defined",
    ", the reader may wonder at this point if it is possible to find regions of dimension @xmath37 which leave the spectrum invariant when dirichlet bc are enforced . in this case",
    "the application of gauss theorem must be specific to the problem , since @xmath21 will be now the infinitesimal surface enclosing the dirichlet region .",
    "we may however convince ourselves that it is indeed possible by looking at a specific example : consider the hamiltonian for a @xmath38 problem , which is separable in the form @xmath39 , where @xmath40 . here",
    "@xmath41 contains the coordinates @xmath42 and their conjugate momenta , while @xmath43 contains the remaining coordinates and momenta . in this case",
    "the solution of the problem is obtained as the direct product of the solutions of @xmath41 and @xmath43 respectively .",
    "therefore , adding @xmath1 piercings of infinitesimal size to @xmath41 can be interpreted as adding @xmath1 regions of dimension @xmath44 with dirichlet boundary conditions to the original domain . since the spectrum of @xmath41 is unchanged under this operation ,",
    "we conclude that the same is true for the total hamiltonian @xmath45 .",
    "the simple harmonic oscillator in @xmath46 dimensions is the ideal test of the results presented in the previous section , given that analytical results can be obtained .",
    "the sse in this case reads ( x_1 ,  , x_d ) = 0  , where @xmath47 is the laplacian operator in @xmath0 dimensions . for simplicity",
    "we study only spherically symmetric states with zero angular momentum and therefore consider only the radial part of the laplacian ( @xmath48 ) .     after introducing the standard dimensionless variables @xmath49 and @xmath50  , the use of @xmath51 or @xmath52 is equivalent . ]",
    "we write @xmath53 and obtain the differential equation  ( ) + ( - 2 ) ()+ ( 2- d ) ( ) = 0  .",
