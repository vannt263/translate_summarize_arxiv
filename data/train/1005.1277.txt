    "the presence of cold dark matter ( dm ) in our universe provides the most natural explanation for several observational puzzles , from the original measurement of the rotational curves  @xcite of galaxies to the observation of background objects in the bullet cluster  @xcite and spectrum features of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) fluctuations . in the conventional picture , dm accounts for the majority of mass in our universe .",
    "however , the nature of dm is still very much a mystery , which could intimately connect astronomical observations with predictions of various elementary particle theories .",
    "many such theories , with the notable exception of the standard model ( sm ) , predict one or more stable , electrically - neutral particles in their spectrum  @xcite .",
    "these particles could form all or part of the non - baryonic dark matter in the universe .",
    "different models provide different assignments for dm particles spin and various windows for their masses and couplings to luminous matter . in the most popular models dm is a weakly interacting particle particle with mass set around the electroweak energy scale .",
    "this follows from the experimental measurements of the relic abundance @xmath6 by wmap collaboration  @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the mass and the interaction strength associated with dm annihilation respectively .",
    "as one can see , a weakly - interacting massive particle ( wimp ) with electroweak - scale mass naturally gives the result of eq .",
    "( [ relab ] ) .",
    "this , coupled with an observation that very light dm particles might overclose the universe ( known as the lee - weinberg limit  @xcite ) , seems to exclude the possibility of the light - mass solution for dm , setting @xmath10  gev .",
    "a detailed look at this argument reveals that those constraints could be easily avoided , so even mev - scale particles can be good dm candidates .",
    "for instance , dm could be non - fermionic  @xcite , in which case the usual suppression of the dm annihilation cross - section used in setting the lee - weinberg limit does not hold .",
    "in addition , low energy resonances could enhance the cross - section without the need for a large coupling constant .",
    "other solutions , which also provide low - mass candidates for dm particles , are also possible  @xcite .",
    "there are many experiments designed to search for both direct interactions of dm with the detector and indirect evidence of dm annihilations in our or other galaxies by looking for the products such as gamma - rays , positrons and antiprotons .",
    "those can in principle probe low - mass dm . however , direct searches , performed by experiments such as dama and cdms  @xcite , rely on the measurement of the kinematic recoil of the nuclei in dm interactions . for cold dm particles ,",
    "such measurements lose sensitivity with the decreasing mass of the wimp as recoil energy becomes smaller  @xcite .",
    "indirect experiments , such as hess  @xcite , are specifically tuned to see large energy secondaries , only possible for weak - scale wimps .",
    "the backgrounds for positron and antiproton searches by heat and/or pamela experiments  @xcite could be prohibitively large at small energies .",
    "it is well - known that the existing @xmath0 flavor factories and future super - flavor factories could provide the perfect opportunity to search for rare processes , especially the ones that require high purity of the final states . in particular , probes of rare b - decays , such as @xmath11 , are only possible at those machines .",
    "these colliders , where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are produced in charge and cp - correlated states , have an opportunity to tag the decaying heavy meson  on the other side , \" which provides the charge or cp - identification of the decaying  signal \" @xmath14 or @xmath15 meson .",
    "in fact , many cp - violating parameters at b - factories have been measured using this method  @xcite .",
    "it is then possible to perform a similar tag on the meson decaying to a pair of light dm particles or a pair of dm particles and a photon .",
    "the latter process might become important for some dm models as it eliminates helicity suppression of the final state - mesons , where the branching ratios @xmath16 and @xmath17 . ] .",
    "moreover , compared to @xmath18 transitions , where @xmath19 is missing energy , a massless photon could provide better experimental opportunities for tagging without reducing the probed parameter space of the dm masses .",
    "finally , searches for light dm in heavy meson decays could be more sensitive than direct detection and other experiments , as dm couplings to heavy quarks could be enhanced , as for example happens in higgs portal models  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we compute branching ratios for the heavy meson states decaying into @xmath20 and @xmath21 . here",
    "@xmath22 is a dm particle of spin @xmath23 , which appears as missing energy in a detector .",
    "the dm _ anti - particle _ @xmath24 may or may not coincide with @xmath22",
    ". we shall first consider model - independent interactions of dm particles of spin-0 , spin-1/2 , and spin-1 with quarks . in each case",
    "we write the most general effective hamiltonian coupling dm particles to flavor - changing @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 ) or @xmath27 current and compute @xmath28 decay rates .",
    "we then consider popular models , already available in the literature , that can generate those processes .",
    "the computation of decay rates for two - body processes @xmath29 is a straightforward task which only requires the knowledge of appropriate @xmath30 matrix elements .",
    "we use conventional parameterization for those , [ currmatrel ] 0|   ^ q|b_q&= & 0 , 0|   q  |b_q= 0 , + 0|  ^_5 q  |b_q&=&i f_b_q p^ , 0|  _ 5 q|b_q= -i , where @xmath31 is the 4-momentum of heavy meson @xmath32 .",
    "similar formulas can be obtained for @xmath15-meson . in what follows",
    "we shall provide relevant derivations for @xmath32 mesons only , but report results for both @xmath32 and @xmath33-meson decays .    before computing the relevant dm production rates ,",
    "let us study the standard model background for the decays with missing energy realized in transitions to @xmath34 states .",
    "the standard model effective hamiltonian for @xmath35 reads _",

    "the functions @xmath38 are relevant combinations of the cabbibo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) factors and inami - lim functions . for @xmath39 transitions these functions are overwhelmingly dominated by the top - quark contribution , _ k _ k x^l(x_k ) = v_tq^ * v_tb x(x_t ) ,   x(x_t ) = and @xmath40 .",
    "perturbative qcd corrections can be taken into account by the replacement  @xcite x_0(x_t ) , where @xmath41 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . they change our estimate by at most 10% , and therefore be neglected in our analysis .",
    "for @xmath27 transitions we keep the contributions from both internal @xmath42 and @xmath23-quarks , so _",
    "k _ k x^l(x_k ) = v_cs^ * v_us x^l(x_s)+v_cb^ * v_ub x^l(x_b ) ,   x^l(x_q ) = d(x_q , y_l)/2 where @xmath43 is the inami - lim function  @xcite for @xmath44 , d(x_q , y_l)&= & ( ) ^2 y_l + x_q + & + & -(1 + 3 ) given this , one can easily estimate branching ratios for @xmath45 decays .",
    "one can immediately notice that the left - handed structure of the hamiltonian should result in helicity suppression of those transitions .",
    "assuming for neutrino masses that @xmath46",
    "ev  @xcite , where @xmath47 is the mass of one of the neutrinos , we obtain for the branching ratio @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the total width of the @xmath51 meson . with @xmath52",
    "ps we obtain @xmath53 . a similar calculation yields @xmath54 .",
    "clearly such tiny rates imply that decays of heavy mesons into neutrino - antineutrino final states in the standard model can be safely neglected as sources of background in the searches for dm in @xmath12-decays .",
    "this is one of the main differences between this study and studies of dm production in @xmath55 transitions  @xcite .",
    "helicity suppression in the final state can be overcome by adding a third particle , such as a photon , to the final state .",
    "the calculation of @xmath56 has been done before  @xcite , so here we simply present an update . the branching ratio for @xmath56 in principle",
    "depends on several form - factors , [ vaformfactors ] ( k)| _ q| b_q(k+q)&= & e   _ ^ * q^k^ , + ( k ) | _ _ 5 q| b_q(k+q)&= & -i e @xmath57\\ ] ] matrix element @xmath58 can be obtained using identity @xmath59  @xcite @xmath60 where @xmath61 are known from qcd light - cone sum rules .",

    "it is important to note that only one out of two form - factors is independent . indeed , as it was shown in  @xcite , [ hqrel ] f_v^b(e_)=f_a^b(e _ ) = ( -q_q r_q + ) + o()f_b_q , where @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath64 are the electrical charges of @xmath65 and @xmath42-quarks .",
    "similar form factor can be obtained for the @xmath15-meson after a suitable redefinition of quark masses and charges .",
    "one - loop qcd corrections to the eq .",
    "( [ hqrel ] ) can also be computed  @xcite .    the amplitude for @xmath66 transition",
    "could be written as a(b_q ) = _",
    "l ^_l , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 is the electric charge .",
    "this results in the photon spectrum and a branching ratio , @xmath69 where we set @xmath70 .",
    "numerically , @xmath71 .",
    "similar results for @xmath72 and @xmath33 mesons are @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively .",
    "it is important to notice that the approach to rare radiative transitions described above works extremely well for sm neutrinos in the final state since @xmath75 over most of the available phase space .",
    "it might not be the case for the dm production .",
    "in particular , for @xmath76 gev , the photon energy is quite small and corrections to eq .",
    "( [ hqrel ] ) could become significant .",
    "therefore , our results obtained by using the formalism above should be corrected , for instance , using heavy meson chiral techniques .",
    "currently the only experimental constraints on @xmath3 and @xmath4 transitions are available from @xmath72 decays  @xcite , @xmath77 one can see that while the branching ratios for the decays into @xmath78 final states are orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding decays into @xmath79 final states , they are still way beyond experimental sensitivities of currently operating detectors .",
    "thus , we conclude that sm provides no irreducible background to studies of light dm in such decays .",

    "( [ scaloper ] ) implies that the mediator of interaction between dm and the sm fields is assumed to be heavy , @xmath87 , it is easy to account for the light mediator by substituting @xmath88 . clearly , a resonance enhancement of @xmath89 rate is possible if for some reason the mediator s mass happens to be close to @xmath90 .",
    "if observed , this resonance enhancement would be seen as anomalously large wilson coefficients of the effective hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ scaloper ] ) .",
    "let us first compute the @xmath91 transition rate .",

    "since the models with self - conjugated dm scalar fields only contain operators @xmath103 and @xmath104 , @xmath105 transitions could be used to test the structure of the scalar dm sector .      in this section",
    "we apply the techniques described above for the most general effective hamiltonian for dm particles interacting with the sm fields to particular model implementations of scalar dm , already available in the literature .",
    "the list of models considered below is by no means exhaustive .      the simplest possible model for scalar dm involves a real scalar field @xmath106 coupled to the sm particles through the exchange of higgs boson  @xcite ( see also  @xcite )",

    "the transition @xmath116 occurs in the minimal model as a one - loop process , and since mediating higgs boson is much heavier than other particles involved in the process , it can be integrated out .",

    "<S> beauty and charm @xmath0 factories running at resonance thresholds have unique capabilities for studies of the production of light dark matter particles in the decays of @xmath1 meson pairs . we provide a comprehensive study of light dark matter production in heavy meson decays with missing energy @xmath2 in the final state , such as @xmath3 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that such transitions can be studied at the current flavor factories ( and future super - flavor factories ) by tagging the missing - energy decays with @xmath5 decays  on the other side . \" </S>"
