    "this range is from approximately 0.02 smaller than @xmath65 to a region where doublers appear in the overlap formalism .",
    "we find that the behaviour described in the following is general for all configurations : each of the eigenmodes is localised .",

    "this localization weakens and the density , @xmath67 , broadens quickly .",
    "an exponential decay of the density @xmath56 , as previously observed @xcite , seems likely to occur .",

    "[ fig : modes ] reveals the presence of an eigenmode , correlated to one topological object , but with a spectral flow containing two zero crossings .",
    "the size of the correlated object , obtained in the following section , suggests that this object is a lattice artifact .    around @xmath65 and towards the upper end of the analysed spectrum ,",
    "localisations are weak . however , the correlation of positions is strong . at these @xmath4",
    "we tend to get correlations to more than one topological object .",

    "we find that the closer the eigenvalues and the weaker the actual localisations , the more likely it is to get correlation with more than one topological object in the corresponding eigenmodes .",
    "calculations of 20 eigenmodes for selected values of @xmath4 on hot configurations show only little broadening in the localisations and persistent correlations with topology .",
    "this suggests that this behaviour will not change quickly and such correlations will persist for even higher eigenmodes .",
    "as mentioned above , we use the topological charge density of the 12-sweep cooled configuration for comparison .",
    "the position of eigenmodes on cooled fields agree perfectly well with the position of topological objects seen in this density .",
    "a typical distance between such positions being 0.05 lattice units . for hot configurations",
    "some of the correlations are slightly offset compared to the structure in the smoothed configurations whereas other structure in the eigenmodes has no corresponding structure in the smoothed topological charge .",
    "but in those cases a comparison with a less cooled configuration reveals correlations between eigenmodes and topological objects which are moved or destroyed by further cooling .",
    "this behaviour is expected and understood , as topological objects are known to move under cooling as instantons and anti - instantons attract each other and annihilate when they are close enough together .",
    "this clear correlation between @xmath56 of eigenmodes on hot configurations and topological objects suggests that it is possible to identify areas through the noise of a hot configuration with significant topology .",
    "we can `` see through '' the noise by using eigenmodes of the hermitian wilson - dirac operator .",
    "the spectral plot of the first four eigenvalues of a 12-sweep cooled configuration looks different compared to the same plot on a hot configuration . comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : modes ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : coolspectr ] we notice the rhomboid shape with an area without any eigenvalues in the spectral plot of the cooled configuration .",
    "this is expected for such smoothed configurations @xcite .",
    "eigenmodes on the right - hand side of this rhomboid behave different than eigenmodes on the left - hand side of the rhomboid .",
    "the localization of the eigenmodes on the left - hand side is approximately the same as the localisations in the hot configuration .",
    "but the eigenmodes on the right - hand side are much weaker in localization .",
    "those weaker localised eigenmodes are related to very high eigenmodes in the hot configuration and the process of cooling brings them into an area where we can observe them as low eigenmodes .",
    "these eigenmodes must be very high eigenmodes in a hot configuration for they are much weaker localised as localisations we have seen for up to the 20th eigenmode in a hot configuration .",
    "although the behaviour in localization strength for eigenmodes of cooled configurations is different from that of eigenmodes of hot configurations the correlations with topological objects still exist for all eigenmodes .",
    "we will take a closer look at localization strength and quantify it in the next section .",
    "as described earlier in this paper , the localization of the eigenmodes change shape and size with changing of @xmath4 . in order to quantify this behaviour",
    "we have two methods .",
    "the first one is fairly simple .",
    "we have already seen that most eigenmodes are localized at one topological object .",
    "as the eigenmodes are all normalized , the maximum , or peak , value of the eigenmode density is an indicator of how strong this localization is .",
    "[ fig : maxhot ] shows the plot of such peak values for four eigenmodes each of three hot @xmath71 configurations . this plot shows a smooth behaviour with a maximum for @xmath72 for the lowest eigenmodes .",
    "this suggests that for hot su(3 ) configurations the strongest localisation occurs in that @xmath4 region .",
    "[ fig : maxcool ] shows the same plot for four eigenmode densities each for three 12-sweep cooled @xmath71 configurations .",
    "this plot shows a different behaviour .",
    "again there is a clear peak , but the values drop to almost zero immediately after the peak .",
    "we expect this to happen after our qualitative observations in the previous section .",
    "these low maximum values correspond to weakly localized modes , which are on the right - hand side of the spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coolspectr ] . in this case",
    "we can not determine @xmath69 , for it is not clear how the localisations are going to develop if we follow the stronger localised eigenmodes up to higher values of @xmath4 .",
    "the one eigenmode we could follow suggests that @xmath73 . this reduction of @xmath69 is about the same size as the reduction of @xmath65 for going from the hot to the 12-sweep cooled configuration .    to get more information about the shape of the eigenmodes",
    ", we fit the instanton model , eq .  ( [ eq : instzeromodel ] ) , to the eigenmodes .",
    "this model gives us very good fits as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the 6 parameter fit of @xmath76 points of @xmath77 centered about the peak of @xmath56 .",
    "this value is about 1000 times smaller than the peak value and @xmath78 is the worst case with most of the fits of order @xmath79 to @xmath80 .",
    "the fit parameter @xmath81 is then a good measurement for the size of the localization .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rhohot ] we plot @xmath82 for four eigenmodes calculated on all hot configurations and in fig .  [",
    "fig : rhocool ] for four eigenmodes calculated on all 12-sweep cooled configurations .",
    "we see a behaviour which corresponds to the behaviour described above for the peak values of the eigenmodes .",
    "@xmath82 for the hot configurations shows a smooth behaviour with a minimum around @xmath83 .",
    "this means the eigenmodes are maximally localised for this value of @xmath4 and are less localized for both ends of the spectrum .",
    "the @xmath69 found this way varies slightly from @xmath69 found by just taking the peak values of the eigenmode densities .",
    "it is about 0.03 larger at 0.26 for the lowest eigenmode .",
    "as we mentioned earlier the eigenmodes for low and high values of @xmath4 are localized on more than one topological object .",
    "therefore fig .",
    "[ fig : rhohot ] reports more local maxima than modes at these @xmath4 .",
    "however in the range @xmath84 only one local maximum is found per mode .",
    "we have established that low - lying eigenmodes are correlated to a single topological object when eigenmodes are non degenerate .",
    "it is also established that an instanton gives rise to a zero crossing in the spectral flow with the sign of the slope equal to the sign of the topological charge @xcite . however , as mentioned above , fig .",
    "[ fig : modes ] reveals an eigenmode correlated to one topological object , but with two zero crossings .",
    "the size of the eigenmode varies from @xmath85 to @xmath86 as @xmath4 varies from 0.21 to 0.27 .",
    "the size of the correlated object on the topological charge density , which can only be seen on the 5-sweep - cooled configuration , is @xmath87 .",
    "we have been able to reproduce similar spectral flows on single instanton configurations , which have been cooled with the wilson action to the point where the topological charge is @xmath88 , well below 1 .",
    "hence the double zero crossing of the spectral flow in fig .",
    "[ fig : modes ] suggests the presence of a lattice artifact . ideally an improved fermion action should act to remove the zero crossings associated with this artifact .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath82 of the cooled configurations shows a jump at @xmath89 , where the weakly localised modes set in as described above .",
    "some of these weakly localised modes are not sufficiently localised to allow a fit to the instanton model .",
    "a fit would result in values for @xmath90 , which are not reasonable for the instanton model and therefore neglected .",
    "for those eigenmodes where we can do a fit , we get large values of @xmath81 compared to the strongly localised eigenmodes .",
    "we find that @xmath81 is about 2 for strongly localised eigenmodes and about 6 for weakly localised eigenmodes . for @xmath91",
    ", @xmath82 decreases smoothly , but for @xmath92 the values of @xmath82 are higher than at the lower end of the spectrum and do not show a smooth behaviour .",
    "again it is hard to extract @xmath69 , but it seems that if we could follow the stronger localised modes further it would be around 0.22 .",
    "this is about 0.02 larger than the @xmath69 , which is extracted using the peak values .",

    ", we find the topological object which is located closest to the position of the eigenmode .",
    "we can fit the instanton model only to topological charge densities of cooled configurations , as only those are smooth enough .",
    "therefore we only compare the sizes of eigenmodes of cooled configurations with sizes of actual topological objects . due to the different localization strength for eigenmodes on the left - hand and on the right - hand side of the rhomboid spectrum of a cooled configuration ,",
    "we look at those eigenmodes separately .    we find that the fitted positions for the strongly localised eigenmodes agree very well .",
