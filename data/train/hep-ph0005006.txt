    "<S> in this work , we calculate the branching ratios and cp asymmetries of the decays of @xmath0 and @xmath1 with the frame of qcd factorization in the heavy quark limit . we also compare the results with the estimates by using generalized factorization and experimental measurements .    * </S>",
    "<S> pacs numbers 13.25.hw 12.38.bx *    in the past two years , the cleo collaborations@xcite had improved their measurements for the branching ratios of @xmath0 and @xmath1 for several times . </S>",
    "<S> the latest results of branching ratios of these modes are : @xmath2 these two - body non - leptonic charmless b decay modes play a very important role in studying cp violation and the heavy flavor physics . </S>",
    "<S> theoretically , due to our ignorance of hadronization , it is difficult to relate cp violations with the parameters of fundamental theory . </S>",
    "<S> effective hamiltonian is our basic tool , but we do not know how to calculate hadronic matrix element from first principles . </S>",
    "<S> conventionally we resort to naive factorization assumption@xcite , which expresses the hadronic matrix element in terms of various meson decay constants and form factors . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is well known that non - factorizable contribution really exists and can not be neglected numerically . to remedy factorization hypothesis , </S>",
    "<S> ref.@xcite introduced a phenomenological parameter @xmath3 , which is commonly called generalized factorization . because in principle @xmath3 is process - dependent , it is still not a satisfactory approach .    in last year , </S>",
    "<S> beneke _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite gave a nlo calculation of @xmath0 in heavy quark limit . </S>",
    "<S> in this limit , the hadronic matrix elements for @xmath0 can expanded by the powers of @xmath4 and @xmath5 as follows :    @xmath6,\\ ] ]    where @xmath7 is a local four quark operator in the weak effective hamiltonian and @xmath8 are bilinear quark currents . neglecting the power contribution of @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> , they pointed out that in the heavy quark limit the radiative corrections at the order of @xmath4 can be calculable with pqcd method . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the non - factorizable contributions from hard scattering with spectator quark in b meson can also be calculable within the frame of pqcd . </S>",
    "<S> then the decay amplitude can be expressed by the convolutions of the hard - scattering kernels and several light - cone distribution amplitudes of the mesons . </S>",
    "<S> so all of these can be summarized into a factorization formula for @xmath0 as follows :    @xmath9    we call this factorization formalism as qcd factorization . in the above formula , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the leading - twist light - cone distribution amplitudes of b and pion mesons respectly , and the @xmath12 denote hard - scattering kernels which are calculable in perturbative theory . </S>",
    "<S> beneke _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ regarded the spectator quark as a soft quark translated to one pion in final state unless it undergoes a hard interaction , so the transition form factor @xmath13 can not be calculated in the perturbative frame , and it will be survived as a free nonperturbative parameter in qcd factorization . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath14 at the order of @xmath4 includes two topological classes , one is hard gluon scattering like vertex corrections which is described by the first four diagrams in fig.1 , and we call it as hard - scattering corrections below ; the other is called penguin correction , which is described by diag.(e ) and ( f ) in fig.1 . @xmath15 denotes the hard spectator scattering contribution which is described by the last two diagrams in fig.1 . in this frame , they neglected w - annihilation and w - exchange topologies , so they show that non - factorizable contributions in the conventional factorization are calculable in heavy quark limit . </S>",
    "<S> then we do not need to employ a phenomenological parameter @xmath3 to compensate the non - factorizable effects in principle . </S>",
    "<S> thus we will apply this approach to calculate the branching ratios and cp asymmetries for the decays @xmath0 and @xmath1 in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , since the effects of electroweak penguins can not be neglected in some decay modes of @xmath16 , we will use full effective weak hamiltonian including electroweak penguin operators and add some one - loop qed penguin correction to the calculation of hadronic matrix elements of effective operators which can also be described by diag.(e ) and diag.(f ) ( replacing gluon with photon ) in fig.1 in our computation .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath17 effective hamiltonian is given by@xcite @xmath18+h.c.,\\ ] ] where @xmath19(for @xmath20 transition ) or @xmath21(for @xmath22 transition ) and @xmath23 are wilson coefficients which have been evaluated to next - to - leading order approximation . in the eq.(1 ) , the four - quark operators @xmath24 are given by @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath27 being the tree operators , @xmath28 the qcd penguin operators and @xmath29 the electroweak penguin operators . with the renormalization group method </S>",
    "<S> , we can evolve the wilson coefficients @xmath23 from the scale @xmath30 to @xmath31 . because we will give a nlo calculation here </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath32 and @xmath33 effective hamiltonian must be included . </S>",
    "<S> they are @xmath34 + h.c.,\\ ] ] where @xmath35    following the method of ref.@xcite , we try to evaluate the matrix elements of @xmath24 to the order of @xmath4 and @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , this work is to calculate hadronic matrix elements of @xmath24 to one loop . in quark level </S>",
    "<S> , ref@xcite gives an expression    @xmath37\\cdot \\langle \\bf{q } \\rangle_0.\\ ] ]    here @xmath38 and @xmath39 represent the one loop corrections of qcd and qed respectly . </S>",
    "<S> these corrections are divided into two classes . </S>",
    "<S> one is hard - scattering correction , the other is penguin correction . while the external quarks are on mass - shells , the hard - scattering corrections bring infrared divergences which can not vanish after summing over all this kind of perturbative diagrams no matter with gluon or photon exchange . </S>",
    "<S> however , in hadron level , with qcd factorization in the heavy quark limit , these infrared divergences from hard - scattering exchanging with gluon can be canceled after summing over all this kind of perturbative diagrams ( the first four diagrams in fig.1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this has been shown in ref.@xcite . but </S>",
    "<S> for the case of qed hard - scattering ( exchanging photon ) , the infrared divergences can not be canceled after summing over all diagrams even in the heavy quark limit . </S>",
    "<S> it is because that the color structure of qed hard - scattering corrections is different from that of qcd . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that those divergences could be canceled by soft photon radiative corrections . </S>",
    "<S> however , nobody knows how to include these radiative corrections in exclusive decay channels . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath36 is very small , we will neglect qed hard - scattering corrections in our computation . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the penguin corrections are calculable not only for the case of qcd but also for that of qed . in quark level , considering only the contributions from tree operators , the penguin corrections can be written in ndr scheme as@xcite @xmath40 , \\\\ </S>",
    "<S> ( \\hat{m}_s(\\mu))_{14}=(\\hat{m}_s(\\mu))_{16}= -\\frac{1}{2}[-\\frac{2}{3 } + g(m_q , q , \\mu ) ] , \\\\ </S>",
    "<S> ( \\hat{m}_e(\\mu))_{27}=(\\hat{m}_e(\\mu))_{29}= -\\frac{4}{3}[-\\frac{2}{3 } + g(m_q , q , \\mu ) ] , \\\\ ( \\hat{m}_e(\\mu))_{17}=(\\hat{m}_e(\\mu))_{19}= -\\frac{4}{9}[-\\frac{2}{3 } + g(m_q , q , \\mu)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath41 here , @xmath42 in @xmath43 remains uncertain for the calculation of exclusive b decays . </S>",
    "<S> however , if we take @xmath42 around @xmath44 in computations with conventional factorization scheme , this variation does not change the results too much@xcite . with the frame of qcd factorization in the heavy quark limit </S>",
    "<S> , there will be no uncertainty for @xmath42 , this will be shown below . </S>",
    "<S> so , similar to what done in ref.@xcite , we will take both qcd and qed penguin corrections into account . </S>",
    "<S> surely , for the importance of electroweak penguins in the decays @xmath45 , we must take qed penguin corrections into account as well .    then in heavy quark limit , the amplitude for the decay of b to two light pseudoscalar mesons @xmath46 and @xmath47 can be written as follows : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is ckm factor and @xmath50 is the factorized matrix elements which can be expressed by the product of the relevant decay constant and form factor . </S>",
    "<S> taking @xmath51 and assuming the distribution amplitudes of light pseudoscalar mesons symmetric , we obtain the qcd coefficients @xmath52 at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in naive dimension regularization ( ndr ) scheme ( except @xmath53 and @xmath54 which read at leading order here for some special reasons ) . in order to cancel the scheme dependence in our calculation , </S>",
    "<S> we must take wilson coefficients @xmath55 in ndr scheme as well </S>",
    "<S> . then the explicit formulas of @xmath52 can be written as @xmath56 ,   \\\\ </S>",

    "<S> we define the symbols in the above expressions as the same as beneke s , which are @xmath60 with @xmath61 here @xmath62 is the leading twist distribution amplitude of the light meson , and @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath64 is the mass of quark appearing in the penguin loop . ) </S>",
    "<S> the contribution from the hard spectator scattering are reduced into the factor @xmath65 which is written as    @xmath66    in above expression , @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) is the pseudoscalar meson ( b meson ) decay constant , @xmath69 the b meson mass , @xmath70 the @xmath71 form factor at zero momentum transfer , and @xmath72 the light - cone momentum fraction of the spectator in the b meson .    </S>",
    "<S> one can find that our expressions are a little bit different from those in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we think that there is an extra term @xmath73 in eq.(18 ) which is missed in eq.(8 ) of ref.@xcite , but this difference is not large enough to make the numerical results change too much . in addition , in the modes @xmath16 , @xmath65 should be changed with the corresponding meson which contains the spectator quark . </S>",
    "<S> but numerically the ratio @xmath74 is nearly equal to @xmath75 , so @xmath76 , we will not distinguish them in computation below .    </S>",
    "<S> for the coefficients @xmath53 and @xmath54 , we want to give some comments . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that the singularity of the hard - scattering function @xmath77 is at the endpoint @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> if the distribution amplitudes did not fall off fast enough at the endpoints to suppress these singularities in hard - scattering functions , our calculations would not be infrared safe . </S>",
    "<S> for the case of @xmath79 and @xmath80 , we might use the twist-2 distribution amplitudes for pion or kaon which can cancel the infrared divergences . unfortunately , for the case of @xmath81 , we must employ the twist-3 distribution amplitudes . as pointed in ref.@xcite , the twist-3 distribution amplitudes for pion and kaon do not fall off at endpoints . </S>",
    "<S> so if this was true , the infrared divergences could not cancel in the calculation . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , as mentioned at the end of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the factorization formula breaks down in this case . </S>",
    "<S> we also noticed that in recent papers@xcite , the authors employed the twist-3 distribution amplitudes for pion and kaon which fall off fast enough at the endpoints , but that is just a model and not a prediction from qcd sum rule or other non - perturbative approaches . </S>",
    "<S> so we still employ the asymptotic twist-3 distribution amplitudes of pion and kaon as @xmath82 , then the singularities at the endpoints in hard - scattering kernels can not be suppressed by the distribution amplitudes in the case of @xmath53 and @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> like what beneke _ et al . _ do , we take @xmath53 and @xmath54 at leading order here .    in the b rest frame , </S>",
    "<S> the two body decay width is @xmath83 where @xmath84^{\\frac { 1}{2 } } }     { 2m_b}\\ ] ] is the magnitude of the momentum of the particle @xmath46 or @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding branching ratio is given by @xmath86 the direct cp asymmetry @xmath87 for @xmath88 meson decays into @xmath89 is defined as @xmath90 here we do not consider @xmath91 mixing just for simplification .    </S>",
    "<S> because the momentum fraction distribution of the spectator quark in b meson is peaked at @xmath92 , we will take the distribution amplitude for b meson as @xmath93 @xmath94 is equal to the parameter @xmath95 in ref.@xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we take @xmath96 . for simplification </S>",
    "<S> , we will take the asymptotic form for the leading twist distribution amplitudes of pion and kaon as same as ref@xcite : @xmath97    after straightforward calculations , we carry out the branching ratios and direct cp asymmetries for the decays @xmath98 and @xmath1 at two different renormalization scales @xmath99 and @xmath100 which are listed in tab.2 and tab.3 respectly . </S>",
    "<S> ( wilson coefficients in ndr scheme @xcite at two scales are listed in tab.1 . ) as a comparison , we also show the results with the conventional factorization ( bsw factorization and @xmath101 ) in the last two tables . in our computation </S>",
    "<S> , we take the wolfenstein parameters of ckm matrix as follows : @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding decay constants and form factors are taken as follows@xcite : @xmath106 gev , @xmath107 gev ; @xmath108 and @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> quark masses are taken as : @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 .    </S>",
    "<S> from both tab.2 and tab.3 , we find that qcd factorization enhance the contributions from penguins so much that the branching ratios of @xmath45 become larger nearly by a factor of 2 than the estimate of the generalized factorization . </S>",
    "<S> it is because that the qcd and qed corrections are constructive to the amplitudes with the generalized factorization and they enhance the branching ratios . </S>",
    "<S> one also see that the contributions from electroweak penguins can not be neglected in the decays @xmath113 and @xmath114 no matter with the generalized factorization or qcd factorization , because the amplitudes of these two modes contain a term of the coefficient @xmath115 which is large enough to compare with the coefficients of qcd penguins . for the case of @xmath116 , </S>",
    "<S> the differences between these two factorization schemes are not too apparent because that this decay mode is dominated by the coefficient @xmath117 . </S>",
    "<S> the radiative correction to @xmath117 at the order of @xmath4 is very small comparing with the leading order part of @xmath117 . </S>",
    "<S> this is similar to that the effective coefficient @xmath118 in generalized factorization is unsensitive to the variation of the phenomenological parameter @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> but for the coefficient @xmath119 , it is very different for its small leading order part . </S>",
    "<S> so for the modes @xmath120 and @xmath121 , the differences between these two factorization schemes are very large .    for the case of @xmath87 , </S>",
    "<S> the differences between generalized factorization and qcd factorization in the heavy quark limit are quite large because in qcd factorization the imaginary parts enter the decay amplitudes through hard scattering kernels contribution . </S>",
    "<S> then the strong phases of some @xmath122 ( i = even number ) dominant processes may be changed very much , then cp asymmetries of these modes can be dramatically large . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that cp asymmetries of @xmath121 is about 80% , but this magnificent direct cp asymmetry is very hard to observe for its small branching ratio . for </S>",
    "<S> the modes @xmath16 , the cp asymmetries change much as well . in the modes of @xmath123 , </S>",
    "<S> the signs and magnitudes of cp asymmetries are changed comparing with the results of the generalized factorization .    </S>",
    "<S> the authors of ref.@xcite pointed out that the amplitudes derived from the qcd factorization in the heavy quark limit are independent of the renormalization scale physically . </S>",
    "<S> numerically , we still find that the dependences in our results of the branching ratios for the decays @xmath16 are visible . </S>",
    "<S> comparing the results at the scale @xmath124 and @xmath125 , this variation brings about @xmath126 uncertainty to the estimates for the branching ratios of @xmath16 . as shown in ref.@xcite and our paper , the scale dependences of the results @xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> are small . in recent calculation of @xmath127 in the heavy quark limit@xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the scale dependences are also small . </S>",
    "<S> maybe for the case of pure tree or tree dominant processes , the computation with the frame of the qcd factorization cancels the dependence of the renormalization scale very well . </S>",
    "<S> but for some pure penguin or penguin dominant processes , the scale dependences are visible </S>",
    "<S> . however , these dependences are smaller than the estimates with the generalized factorization .    </S>",
    "<S> we also show the dependences of the branching ratios and direct cp asymmetries on the weak phase @xmath128 respectly in fig.2 and fig.3 . in both fig.2 and fig.3 , </S>",
    "<S> the results of ( a ) and ( b ) are carried out with the qcd factorization in the heavy quark limit at the scale @xmath129 .    from fig.2 and fig3 , we find that the results are in favor of the experimental measurements when @xmath130 because the branching ratio of @xmath131 becomes small and the branching ratios of @xmath132 , @xmath133 and @xmath134 are closer in that region . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the fit for @xmath135 of cleo and other researchers@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that our estimate of branching ratio of @xmath136 seems larger than the experimental measurement even if we take @xmath137 . </S>",
    "<S> and the branching ratio of @xmath114 is about 3 times smaller than the central value of experimental result and unsensitive to the variation of @xmath135 . due to uncertainties of the form factors @xmath138 and @xmath139 , we try to vary these form factors in a relevant region to make the branching ratio @xmath131 smaller while that of @xmath114 is larger . </S>",
    "<S> we find the branching ratios of @xmath98 and @xmath1 are rather sensitive to the form factor @xmath138 than @xmath139 . and both of them increase with @xmath138 . </S>",
    "<S> so our attempt faces a failure . </S>",
    "<S> but now the errors in present measurements of cleo are still large , and some uncertainties remain in theoretical frame , such as , the light - cone distribution amplitudes of the mesons , the heavy to light transition form factors and etc . therefore , the disagreement between our prediction and the present experimental measurement is not so significant . </S>",
    "<S> it needs us more detailed study with the improved experimental measurements and theoretical approaches in future .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , qcd factorization can give an estimate of strong phases in b charmless decays from final state hard scattering . </S>",
    "<S> this might be beneficial to extracting the weak phases from cp asymmetries in b decays . </S>",
    "<S> but due to the theoretical uncertainties such as meson light - cone distribution amplitudes and heavy to light transition form factors , the prediction for branching ratios within the frame of qcd factorization remains a little bit ambiguous . on the other hand , since that @xmath140 is not a very large scale , maybe the corrections at the order of @xmath5 are needed . </S>",
    "<S> so , how to develop a complete perturbative frame of heavy quark expansion in heavy to light decays will be a potentially interesting and beneficial work . </S>"
