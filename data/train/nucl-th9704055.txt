    "dynamical features of open mesoscopic quantum systems are characterized by the presence of  simple \" ( single - particle and collective ) excitations ,  complicated \" ( chaotic ) intrinsic motion involving many degrees of freedom , and irreversible decay into continuum .",
    "the coexistence and interplay of these phenomena is the important aspect of all processes including excitation and deexcitation of the system .",
    "one of the questions of primary interest in nuclear physics , especially for future experiments with radioactive nuclear beams , is that of existence and purity of simple modes of nuclear excitation embedded into continuum .",
    "similar problems arise in atomic and molecular physics , physics of atomic clusters and mesoscopic solid state devices .    during the last decade",
    ", a number of related phenomena were discovered in this area of nuclear physics , see for example @xcite .",
    "saturation of the spreading width of the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) in hot nuclei @xcite , `` disappearance '' of the collective strength of the gdr at high excitation energy @xcite , and existence and relatively narrow width of the double gdr @xcite are just few bright examples . in the physics of isobaric analog states ( ias ) , one can mention the evidence for existence of the so - called `` broad poles '' @xcite , very weak fluctuations of the spreading widths of the ias throughout the periodic table @xcite , and restoration of isospin purity at high excitation energy @xcite .    in such problems ,",
    "one always deals with a simple excitation mixed with the dense background of complicated states .",
    "the simple excitation is associated with a specific signal .",
    "it can be a quantum number which singles out the state in the ocean of surrounding states as it happens in the ias case . as a rule",
    ", such a state is relatively pure with respect to this label when looked at in the entrance channel .",
    "the isospin purity is violated by the internal mixing @xcite when , due to the high background level density , the statistical enhancement of perturbations becomes extremely important , similar to the well known enhancement of weak interactions observed in parity nonconservation @xcite .",
    "the individuality of a `` simple '' mode can also be referred to its specific structure , for example in the case of a giant collective vibration , whose coherence makes the state very different from the background .",
    "such a special state is characterized by a large multipole moment which provides a strong collective gamma decay @xcite . in all cases , the manifestations of the simple mode in specific reaction channels are intertangled with the chaotic mixing inside the system .    as a result of the mixing ,",
    "the simple mode is fragmented over exact stationary states which form the fine structure of the spectrum .",
    "being averaged over the unresolved fine structure , the excitation function is related to the strength distribution of the original `` label '' smoothly depending on excitation energy .",
    "more detailed statistical analysis of observed fluctuations , assuming generic correlations of energies and strengths for the invisible underlying states , is capable @xcite of extracting their characteristics . in general ,",
    "the strength functions and reaction cross sections represent two sides of the process , internal and external , and the relation between them is far from trivial .",
    "thus , the strength distribution may or may not coincide with the width distribution seen in the reactions and decays @xcite .",
    "the well known formalism @xcite of the strength function proceeds as if the states under consideration were stable .",
    "however , all excited states , strictly speaking , have a finite lifetime and therefore belong to the continuum spectrum .",
    "the level widths of the resonances in the continuum @xcite are governed by the interaction which is in general different from that forming the discrete spectrum inside the system .",
    "the effects of intrinsic mixing and coupling to and via continuum have to be considered simultaneously .",
    "below we formulate a consistent quantum - mechanical approach which fully accounts for the interplay of internal damping and decay and contains , as particular cases , the  disappearance \" of the collective strength of the giant resonance @xcite explained by kinetic arguments in @xcite , and the restoration of isospin purity at high excitation energy @xcite in accordance with the old idea by morinaga @xcite and wilkinson @xcite .",
    "we discuss the general properties of the strength function of a simple mode embedded into continuum in its relation to what is observed in reactions .",
    "our consideration , being intentionally schematic and less specific than in the well known review paper @xcite , is in many aspects complementary because of its generality and the simultaneous treatment of internal and external aspects of the problem .",
    "we use the effective non - hermitian hamiltonian @xcite in order to take into account internal and external interactions on equal footing .",

    "all @xmath7 states have the same values of exact integrals of motion such as total angular momentum .",
    "we assume that the basis states are characterized also by quantities like isospin or parity which are approximate integrals of motion .",
    "the isospin mixing which is one of the subjects of our application is introduced explicitly by the off - diagonal elements of the hamiltonian .",
    "parity nonconservation due to weak interactions can be another example of an approximate conservation law which can be included in a similar manner .",
