    "<S> we present a study of the redshift evolution of the projected correlation function of 593 x - ray selected agn with @xmath0 and spectroscopic redshifts @xmath1 , extracted from the 0.5 - 2 kev x - ray mosaic of the 2.13@xmath2 xmm - cosmos survey . </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a method to estimate the average bias of the agn sample and the mass of agn hosting halos , solving the sample variance using the halo model and taking into account the growth of the structure over time . </S>",
    "<S> we find evidence of a redshift evolution of the bias factor for the total population of xmm - cosmos agn from @xmath3 to @xmath4 with an average mass of the hosting dm halos @xmath5 \\sim 13.12 \\pm 0.12 $ ] that remains constant at all @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> + splitting our sample into broad optical lines agn ( bl ) , agn without broad optical lines ( nl ) and x - ray unobscured and obscured agn , we observe an increase of the bias with redshift in the range @xmath7 and @xmath8 which corresponds to a constant halo mass @xmath5 \\sim 13.28 \\pm 0.07 $ ] and @xmath5 \\sim 13.00 \\pm 0.06 $ ] for bl /x - ray unobscured agn and nl / x - ray obscured agn , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> + the theoretical models which assume a quasar phase triggered by major mergers can not reproduce the high bias factors and dm halo masses found for x - ray selected bl agn with @xmath9 s@xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> our work extends up to @xmath11 the @xmath12 statement that , for moderate luminosity x - ray selected bl agn , the contribution from major mergers is outnumbered by other processes , possibly secular such as tidal disruptions or disk instabilities . </S>"
