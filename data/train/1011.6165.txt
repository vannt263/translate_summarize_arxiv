    "these hypotheses are crucial in the study of concentration of the spectral empirical distributions , especially of the linear functionals @xmath36 with individual smooth @xmath37 on the line ; see , for example , the results by guionnet and zeitouni @xcite , chatterjee and bose @xcite , davidson and szarek @xcite and ledoux @xcite .",
    "a remarkable feature of this approach to spectral analysis is that no specific knowledge about the non - explicit mapping from a random matrix to its spectral empirical measure is required .",

    ", one can obtain more information about the fluctuations of @xmath45 for individual points @xmath11 and thus get some control of the kolmogorov distance .",

    "hence , both sides of ( [ for1.6 ] ) are of order 1 .",
    "next , we restrict the above statements to the empirical spectral measures @xmath6 of the @xmath23 eigenvalues @xmath21 of a random symmetric matrix @xmath19 , @xmath71 , with independent entries above and on the diagonal ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "assume that @xmath73 and @xmath74 so that the means @xmath22 converge to the semicircle law @xmath75 with mean zero and variance one .",
    "the boundedness of moments of @xmath24 of any order will be guaranteed by ( [ for1.1 ] ) .",
    "[ teo1.3 ] if the distributions of the @xmath24 s satisfy the poincar - type inequality @xmath30 on the real line , then @xmath76 where @xmath17 is an absolute constant .",

    "the kolmogorov distance @xmath79 is known to tend to zero at rate at most @xmath80 .",
    "for instance , it is true when the distributions of the @xmath81 s have a non - trivial gaussian component ( see @xcite ) .",

    "it seems natural to try to relax the @xmath31-hypothesis in ( [ for1.8 ] ) and ( [ for1.9 ] ) to @xmath30 . in this context , let us mention a result of chatterjee and bose @xcite , who used fourier transforms to derive from @xmath30 a similar bound , @xmath87 as for ( [ for1.7 ] ) , let us return to the two - sided bound ( [ for1.4 ] ) which holds with @xmath88 by the convention that the eigenvalues are listed in increasing order .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of distributions of @xmath13 with fixed or varying indices has been studied by many authors , especially in the standard gaussian case . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath89 is fixed , while @xmath23 grows , @xmath90 converges in distribution to ( a variant of ) the tracy  widom law so the @xmath91 are of order @xmath92 .",
    "this property still holds when @xmath24 are symmetric and have sub - gaussian tails ; see @xcite and @xcite for the history and related results .",
    "although this rate is consistent with the bound ( [ for1.7 ] ) , the main contribution in the normalized sum ( [ for1.4 ] ) is due to the intermediate terms ( in the bulk ) and their rate might be different .",
    "it was shown by gustavsson @xcite for the gue model that if @xmath93 , then @xmath13 is asymptotically normal with variance of order @xmath94 .",

    "we apply the previous results to high - dimensional random matrices to prove theorem [ teo1.3 ] and obtain some refinements .",
    "finally , since the hypotheses ( [ for1.1 ] ) and ( [ for1.2 ] ) play a crucial role in this investigation , we collect in the appendix a few results on sufficient conditions for a measure to satisfy pi and lsi .",
    "we assume that the random variables @xmath18 have a joint distribution @xmath2 on @xmath1 , satisfying the poincar - type inequality ( [ for1.1 ] ) . for a bounded smooth function @xmath37 on the real line ,",
    "we apply it to @xmath97 where @xmath6 is the empirical measure , defined for the ` observations ' @xmath98 . since @xmath99 we obtain an integro - differential inequality , which may viewed as an empirical poincar - type inequality for the measure @xmath2 .",

    "the inequality continues to hold for all locally lipschitz functions with the modulus of the derivative , understood in the generalized sense , that is , @xmath104 .",

    "on the real line , disregarding the problem of optimal constants , poincar - type inequalities may be reduced to hardy - type inequalities with weights .",
    "necessary and sufficient conditions for a measure on the positive half - axis to satisfy a hardy - type inequality with general weights were found in the late 1950s in the work of kac and krein @xcite .",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite and @xcite for a full characterization and an account of the history ; here , we just recall the principal result ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath2 be a probability measure on the line with median @xmath524 , that is , @xmath525 and @xmath526 .",
    "define the quantities @xmath527 , \\\\",
    "a_1(\\mu ) & = & \\sup_{x > m } \\biggl [ \\mu(x,+\\infty ) \\int_x^{+\\infty } \\frac{\\mathrm{d}t}{p_\\mu(t ) } \\biggr],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath528 denotes the density of the absolutely continuous component of @xmath2 ( with respect to lebesgue measure ) and where we set @xmath529 ( resp . ,",
    "@xmath530 ) if @xmath531 ( resp . ,",
    "@xmath532 ) .",
    "we then have the following proposition .",
    "[ proa2 ] the measure @xmath2 on @xmath100 satisfies @xmath533 with some finite constant if and only if both @xmath534 and @xmath535 are finite .",
    "moreover , the optimal value of @xmath25 satisfies @xmath536 where @xmath537 and @xmath538 are positive universal constants .",
    "necessarily , @xmath2 must have a non - trivial absolutely continuous part with density which is positive almost everywhere on the supporting interval .",
    "for example , the two - sided exponential measure @xmath539 , with density @xmath540 , satisfies pi(@xmath25 ) with @xmath541 .",
    "therefore , any lipschitz transform @xmath542 of @xmath539 satisfies",
    "pi(@xmath25 ) with @xmath543 .",
    "the latter property may be expressed analytically in terms of the reciprocal to the so - called isoperimetric constant , @xmath544 where @xmath545 $ ] denotes the distribution function of @xmath2 and @xmath528 the density of its absolutely continuous component .",
    "namely , as a variant of the mazya  cheeger theorem , we have that pi(@xmath546 is valid with @xmath547 ; see @xcite , theorem 1.3 .    to roughly describe the class of measures in the case , where @xmath2 is absolutely continuous and has a positive , continuous well - behaving density , one may note that @xmath548 and the poincar constant are finite , provided that the measure has a finite exponential moment .",
    "in particular , any probability measure with a logarithmically concave density satisfies pi(@xmath546 with a finite @xmath57 ; see  @xcite .    as for logarithmic sobolev inequalities",
    ", we have a similar picture , where the standard gaussian measure represents a basic example and plays a similar role as the two - sided exponential distribution for poincar - type inequalities .",
    "a full description on the real line , resembling proposition [ proa2 ] , was given in @xcite .",
    "namely , for one - dimensional probability measure @xmath2 , with previous notation , we define the quantities @xmath549 ,   \\\\",
    "b_1(\\mu ) & = & \\sup_{x > m } \\biggl [ \\mu(x,+\\infty ) \\log\\frac{1}{\\mu(x,+\\infty ) } \\int_x^{+\\infty } \\frac{\\mathrm{d}t}{p_\\mu(t ) } \\biggr].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we then have the following proposition .",
    "[ proa3 ] the measure @xmath2 on @xmath100 satisfies @xmath550 with some finite constant if and only if @xmath551 and @xmath552 are finite .",
    "moreover , the optimal value of @xmath25 satisfies @xmath553 where @xmath537 and @xmath538 are positive universal constants",
