    "the processes of electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria are of vital biological importance , being central to cellular respiration and hence energy production in most eukaryotic cells .",
    "summaries of these processes can be found in many modern biochemistry textbooks such as @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the basic features of mitochondrial electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation are now well understood , but elucidation of many of the detailed mechanisms is still in progress @xcite .",
    "mitochondrial electron transport occurs via a series of coupled redox reactions in the mitochondrial inner membrane .",
    "after the initial reduction of a first electron donor ( e.g. @xmath0 or @xmath1 produced by glycolysis and the tca cycle ) electrons are transferred from substrate to substrate , finally being accepted by oxygen . during some of these electron transfers",
    "a second process takes place  protons are pumped across the mitochondrial inner membrane producing a proton gradient across this membrane . these protons",
    "then return down their gradient , either passively ( termed leak current ) or through a particular enzyme , @xmath2 synthase , leading to the phosphorylation of adp .",
    "generic models of electron transport chains were explored in @xcite , where the main emphasis was on the input - output response of such models . in the simplest case ,",
    "where the proton gradient across the membrane was ignored , these models were found to have very simple behaviour  at all physically meaningful parameter values there was a single , globally stable , equilibrium . in @xcite ,",
    "this result was shown to generalise to the case of electron transfer networks with more general topology than a chain .",
    "on the other hand in the more biologically realistic case  where the build up of a proton gradient has an inhibitory effect on electron transport  analysis of the models proved harder . in this paper",
    "we analyse in more detail the behaviour in this case .    before discussing generic models",
    ", it is worth mentioning that there are several detailed models of electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation such as @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these ordinary differential equation models have been designed with numerical data in mind , and reflecting the complexity of the processes involved , the functional forms are quite involved .",
    "our interest in mitochondria was originally inspired by analysis and simulation of some of these numerical models , but the approach here is quite different , and more akin to work in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the generic model we construct could be instantiated in a great variety of numerical models , and the claims we make are valid for all possible instances of the generic model .",
    "the basic reaction scheme of interest here was described in some detail in @xcite but will be summarised here .",
    "assume that there are @xmath3 substrates , each of which can exist in an oxidised state @xmath4 and a reduced state @xmath5 so that @xmath6 further , assume that protons can exist in two compartments  the mitochondrial matrix ( where they are termed @xmath7 ) , and the intermembrane space ( where they are termed @xmath8 )  with the possibility of transfers of the form @xmath9 we are interested in reactions which are in general the combination of three processes , a reduction , an oxidation , and the transport of some protons across the membrane .",
    "so for example , if substrate @xmath4 is reduced to @xmath5 , @xmath10 is oxidised to @xmath11 , and @xmath12 protons are pumped across the mitochondrial membrane we get the half reactions @xmath13 which combine to give @xmath14 we also allow the possibility that a reducing / oxidising agent may be external to the model giving reactions such as @xmath15    a set of reactions of the kind just described can be combined into a network of reactions . a chain structure ( as opposed to a more general network ) derives from the assumption that each oxidised substrate accepts an electron from only one donor , and each reduced substrate transfers its electron to only one acceptor .",
    "this introduces a natural ordering on the substrates , so that for @xmath16 , the @xmath17th substrate is able to donate electrons to the @xmath18th substrate , while for @xmath19 , the @xmath17th substrate is able to accept electrons from the @xmath20th substrate .",
    "the first substrate is able to accept electrons from outside the chain ( reflecting the initial reduction of @xmath0 or @xmath1 ) , and the @xmath3th substrate is able to donate electrons to an acceptor outside the chain ( reflecting the action of @xmath21 ) .",
    "thus there are @xmath22 redox reactions and the @xmath17th reaction has forward rate @xmath23 .",
    "we make no assumptions about the sign of the @xmath23 , potentially allowing reactions to be reversible .",
    "for @xmath24 , the @xmath17th reaction involves the reduction @xmath4 , and for @xmath25 , the @xmath17th reaction involves the oxidation of @xmath26 .",
    "we define @xmath27 as the number of protons pumped across the mitochondrial membrane by the @xmath17th reaction . assuming that the quantities @xmath27 are constant discounts the possibility of `` redox slip '' @xcite , which does not appear to be very important in normal circumstances @xcite .",
    "a quantity @xmath28 can be defined so that transfer of a single proton across the membrane creates one unit of @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath28 can take any real value and is a strictly increasing function of the electrical / chemical gradient against which protons are pumped across the membrane , generally termed the proton motive force .",
    "finally , reflecting the combined effect of proton leak and adp phosphorylation , there is a process with rate @xmath29 representing the `` decay '' of @xmath28 . when there is no gradient , no protons leak through the membrane , so that @xmath30 .",
    "further @xmath29 is assumed to be strictly increasing in @xmath28 .",
    "the structure of the model is illustrated in figure  [ basicscheme ] .    a schematic representation of the reaction network .",
    "the quantities @xmath4 and @xmath5 refer to oxidised and reduced states of the substrates .",
    "the functions @xmath23 define the forward rates of reaction of the @xmath22 coupled redox reactions .",
    "the quantity @xmath28 represents the electrical and chemical gradient across the mitochondrial membrane , which has an inhibitory effect on any redox reactions which involve proton pumping.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    because the total quantity  oxidised plus reduced  of any substrate in the chain is conserved , reduced forms of the substrates are not explicitly introduced . instead ,",
    "the concentration of @xmath4 is referred to as @xmath31 , and the total concentration of @xmath32 is assumed constant at @xmath33 .",
    "we arrive at a model of the form :    @xmath34    the phase space of this system is defined by the equations : @xmath35 and is hence @xmath22 dimensional , being the product of a closed @xmath3-dimensional box and the real line .      all the functions @xmath23 , along with @xmath29 ,",
    "are assumed to be @xmath36 ( once differentiable in all their arguments with continuous derivatives ) .",
    "the following notation is used for the derivatives of the functions @xmath23 : @xmath37 at finite substrate concentrations , all reaction rates are finite , so that at any fixed @xmath28 each @xmath23 is bounded on its domain of definition .",
    "since @xmath28 represents a potential against which some of the reactions must do work , the following relations are obtained :    @xmath38    if @xmath39 , then @xmath28 inhibits the forward reaction and we assume that sufficiently large values of @xmath28 make the reaction rate arbitrarily small or negative , i.e. @xmath40 this reflects the fact that the energy required to pump a proton against a chemical and electrical gradient becomes large as the gradient increases .",
    "similarly @xmath41 inhibits the backward reaction so that : @xmath42    the following equations imply that no reaction can proceed in the absence of any of its substrates : @xmath43    the final set of conditions imply that increased substrate concentration increases the rate of reaction unless one of the substrates is entirely absent : @xmath44    the fact that the first and final inequalities are always strict implies that there is always some electron donor to reduce the initial substrate , and some electron acceptor to oxidise the final substrate , and ensures nondegenerate behaviour . the assumptions from ( [ condlast ] )",
    "mean that @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 as defined in ( [ function_labels ] ) are all nonnegative .",
    "the definition of these nonnegative quantities is solely to simplify later arguments .",
    "in this section we outline some properties of the model that hold regardless of the number @xmath3 of redox pairs .",
    "it is convenient to define an @xmath48 matrix which can be regarded as a stoichiometric matrix for the redox reactions : @xmath49\\ ] ]    defining the vector of reactant concentrations @xmath50^t$ ] , the vector of reaction rates @xmath51^t$ ] , and the nonnegative vector @xmath52^t$ ] , we can rewrite the system of equations ( [ dep ] ) more briefly as @xmath53    we now show that all forward trajectories of the system are bounded . since the phase space is bounded in @xmath54 , what needs to be shown is that all trajectories enter a bounded region in the @xmath28 direction .",
    "this amounts to showing that @xmath55 for @xmath28 sufficiently large and negative , and that @xmath56 for @xmath28 sufficiently large and positive . by assumption , for any given @xmath17 ,",
    "either @xmath57 or @xmath58 is strictly negative and @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "this in turn implies that @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "in addition @xmath29 is strictly increasing from zero as @xmath28 increases .",
    "thus for any fixed value of @xmath54 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 . define @xmath65 as the value of @xmath28 at which @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath65 is uniquely defined since @xmath67 is strictly decreasing . by the implicit function theorem",
    ", @xmath65 is a differentiable function since @xmath67 is a differentiable function of @xmath54 .",
    "since it has a compact domain , @xmath65 achieves a maximum value which we call @xmath68 , and a minimum value which we call @xmath69 . by these definitions ,",
    "@xmath70 for all @xmath71 , and @xmath72 for all @xmath73 .",
    "thus all trajectories enter a closed box , @xmath74 , bounded by the hyperplanes @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and this box forms a trapping region for the system in all dimensions .",
    "direct calculation gives that the jacobian , @xmath79 , of the system is :    @xmath80\\ ] ]    here @xmath81 .",
    "the structure of this jacobian can be made clearer by defining two further quantities : a nonnegative vector in @xmath82 , @xmath83^t$ ] ; and an @xmath84 matrix @xmath85\\ ] ] then the jacobian can be written in the block form : @xmath86\\ ] ]    @xmath87 is the jacobian of the system without feedback , which is tridiagonal , and can easily be shown to have real negative eigenvalues @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the structures of @xmath88 and @xmath89 along with the nonnegativity of @xmath90 and @xmath91 imply that @xmath79 is a so called @xmath92 matrix ( see appendix  [ appdefs ] for the definition)th substrate is terminal , and all substrates are able to transfer electrons along the chain to the @xmath3th substrate . ] .",
    "this result is independent of @xmath3 , the length of the chain .",
    "it has the consequence that the system is injective ; this is discussed further in the next section .",
    "the fact that @xmath79 is a @xmath92 matrix has another consequence of importance to us : it means that its eigenvalues are excluded from a certain wedge around the positive real axis : if @xmath93 is an eigenvalue of an @xmath94 @xmath90 matrix , then it is proved in @xcite that : @xmath95 and equivalently for a @xmath92 matrix , @xmath96 clearly when @xmath97 , this means that both eigenvalues lie in the left half plane , so that @xmath98 @xmath92 matrices are hurwitz stable ( see appendix  [ appdefs ] for a definition of `` hurwitz stable '' which we will abbreviate to `` hurwitz '' ) .",
    "however for @xmath99 , @xmath92 matrices may be unstable .",
    "the existence of a unique equilibrium for this system was shown in @xcite by a direct method .",
    "it also follows from the arguments presented above : that an equilibrium must exist follows , by the brouwer fixed point theorem , from the existence of the compact , convex , trapping region , @xmath74 constructed above ; that this equilibrium must be unique follows from the fact that the jacobian is a @xmath92 matrix , and hence the system is injective @xcite .",
    "thus as our first result we can state that    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ electron transport chains coupled to charge translocation across a membrane have exactly one equilibrium .",

    "however this in itself does not tell us whether all trajectories must necessarily converge to the unique equilibrium , or whether periodic or chaotic behaviour is still possible .",
    "in this section , we analyse stability of the unique equilibrium , starting with low dimensions ( i.e. short chains ) . for two dimensions",
    "we prove that the equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable . in three dimensions",
    "we show that the addition of an extra , reasonable , constraint implies that the equilibrium is locally stable , and further constraints ensure that it is globally stable .",
    "we then demonstrate that these constraints do not suffice to guarantee stability in four dimensions and higher . finally , we outline some additional special conditions that guarantee the jacobian is hurwitz in all dimensions .      the system in 2d consists of a single redox pair subject to a reduction process and an oxidation process , both possibly coupled to proton translocation across the membrane .",
    "it takes the form    @xmath100    the jacobian of the system in this case is :    @xmath101\\ ] ]    we have already mentioned that 2d @xmath92 matrices are hurwitz stable , and it follows that the matrices @xmath102 are hurwitz stable ( this can also be shown with a direct calculation ) .",
    "since @xmath102 is hurwitz stable _ everywhere _ , not just at the unique equilibrium , the markus - yamabe theorem ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) ensures that the equilibrium is globally stable .",
    "we also offer an alternative , elementary , proof of global stability . by the poincar - bendixson theorem ( see , for example , @xcite ) , @xmath103-limit sets of a flow on compact subsets of @xmath104 must either contain equilibria or consist of a periodic orbit . in this case",
    "we can rule out the possibility of periodic orbits : the divergence of the vector field is equal to @xmath105 which is negative .",
    "thus the vector field satisfies the dulac criterion ( e.g. @xcite ) and there are no periodic orbits .",
    "we know that there is only one equilibrium , which is locally stable , and therefore there are no heteroclinic or homoclinic orbits either .",
    "since every forward trajectory enters the box @xmath74 , the unique equilibrium must be the @xmath103-limit of every trajectory , and is hence globally stable .",
    "slightly more complex than the two dimensional system is the system in three dimensions which takes the form    @xmath106    with jacobian @xmath107\\ ] ]    as it stands , @xmath108 is not always hurwitz .",
    "for example , the jacobian constructed using the following values : @xmath109 has two eigenvalues with positive real part .",
    "@xmath108 can be shown to be hurwitz everywhere in 3d provided one extra condition is met : @xmath110 and @xmath111 must have the same ordering as @xmath112 and @xmath113 . for a real number @xmath114 ,",
    "define the function @xmath115    then the ordering assumption translates to the following statement : @xmath116    with this assumption , the jacobian is everywhere hurwitz , and hence the equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable .",
    "the proof is simple but requires some lengthy evaluations , and the details are presented in appendix  [ local3d ] .    unlike in the 2d case",
    "it does not follow that the equilibrium is globally stable , since the markus - yamabe conjecture does not hold in dimensions greater than 2 @xcite",
    ". however we can prove global stability in this case too subject to a strengthened version of the ordering assumption on the quantities @xmath27 and @xmath47 .",
    "we now require @xmath117 for @xmath118 .    with this assumption",
    "we are able to use a version of li and muldowney s autonomous convergence theorem ( theorem 4.1 in @xcite ) to show that the unique equilibrium is globally stable . in order to use this theorem two concepts",
    "are needed :    1 .",
    "the * second additive compound * of a matrix 2 .   * logarithmic norms * of a matrix",
    "both quantities are defined for square matrices .",
    "the second additive compound matrix of any @xmath119 matrix @xmath79 is a square matrix of dimension @xmath120 which we will term @xmath121}$ ] .",
    "logarithmic norms are scalar quantities , and corresponding to any given matrix norm , there is a logarithmic norm . unlike matrix norms , however , logarithmic norms may take negative values .",
    "the definitions are given in appendix  [ appdefs ] .",

    "note that @xmath145",
    ". then there are only three cases :    1 .   if @xmath146 , then @xmath147 , and @xmath148 .",

    "this result means that if the ordering assumption ( [ orderass ] ) holds , then the unique equilibrium is globally stable .",
    "the ordering assumption itself has the following reasonable physical meaning which we would expect to be fulfilled in practice : if redox reaction @xmath17 is involved in pumping more protons across the membrane than redox reaction @xmath156 , then reaction @xmath17 is correspondingly more inhibited by @xmath28 than reaction @xmath156 .",
    "it is interesting to note however that this assumption is not necessary to prove global stability in the 2d case .",
    "it is also unknown to us whether the weaker assumption ( [ hurwitz_sign_assumption ] ) , which guarantees that the jacobian is everywhere hurwitz , actually guarantees global stability in 3d .",
    "the ordering assumption ( [ orderass ] ) does not guarantee global or even local stability of the equilibrium in dimensions greater than 3 .",
    "it is easy to construct counterexamples .",
    "for example , in four dimensions , the jacobian constructed by choosing @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 , satisfies all the constraints , including the ordering assumption on the values of @xmath27 and @xmath47 .",
    "however it has , two eigenvalues with positive real part .",
    "we make the following remarks :    1 .   by continuity , the fact that a non - hurwitz jacobian can be constructed in 4 dimensions guarantees that such examples also exist in all higher dimensions . 2 .   systems with non - hurwitz jacobian satisfying the ordering assumption ( [ orderass ] ) seem to be rare . through use of an automated computer script running in the open source numerical computation program scilab @xcite , counterexamples in dimension 4",
    "were found by randomly choosing values for the different terms in the jacobian , such that all the assumptions were satisfied . out of hundreds of millions of sets of values , less than ten were non - hurwitz .",
    "the counterexamples found appear always to be close to breaking the ordering assumption .",
    "for instance , in the example shown , @xmath170 is much greater than @xmath110 , whereas @xmath171 is close in magnitude to @xmath112 .      in this section",
    "we consider an interesting assumption which ensures that the jacobian is hurwitz everywhere ( and hence the unique equilibrium is locally stable ) .",
    "the assumption is as follows :    1 .",
    "associated with each half reaction is some `` potential '' : in the case of a redox reaction of the form @xmath172 , a potential means any strictly increasing scalar function of @xmath173 $ ] ; in the case of a charge transfer across a membrane a potential means any strictly increasing scalar function of @xmath28 .",
    "2 .   the rate of any full reaction depends only on the * sum * of the potentials for the half reactions involved , and is a strictly decreasing function of this sum .",
    "this assumption can be interpreted , loosely , as saying that the energetics of the system determine the reaction rates .",
    "for example , consider the electron transfer coupled to some proton pumping @xmath14 derived from the half reactions @xmath13 in this case , the assumption would imply that the forward rate of the combined reaction can be written @xmath174 where the only stipulation is that @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 and @xmath178 are strictly increasing in their arguments .",
    "when this assumption is made about all reaction rates in the system , the full system becomes :    @xmath179    the term @xmath180 represents the rate at which the @xmath17th substrate receives electrons from the @xmath20th substrate . denoting by @xmath181 , @xmath182 and @xmath183 the derivatives of the functions @xmath23 , @xmath176 and @xmath183 , the jacobian of this system can be written @xmath184 where @xmath185 is the symmetric matrix    @xmath186\\ ] ]    and @xmath187 is the positive diagonal matrix    @xmath188\\ ] ]    from the discussions earlier , @xmath185 is a @xmath92 matrix .",
    "further it is symmetric , and hence sign symmetric ( see appendix  [ appdefs ] for a definition of sign symmetry ) .",
    "this implies @xcite that @xmath185 is @xmath189-stable , i.e. the product of @xmath185 with any positive diagonal matrix is hurwitz .",
    "hence @xmath79 is hurwitz .",
    "thus the assumption that reaction rates depend on the sum of potentials of the half reactions involved ensures that the jacobian of the system is everywhere hurwitz .",
    "we have analysed in some detail , and using a variety of mathematical techniques , the behaviour of electron transport chains coupled to a charge translocation process . in all cases trajectories are bounded , and there is a unique equilibrium , but questions about the stability of this equilibrium have proved harder . where the chain consists of a single redox pair , the unique equilibrium is globally stable .",
    "when there are two redox pairs the same conclusions can be reached subject to some extra conditions on the feedback process . in higher dimensions",
    "no such general conditions could easily be found .",
    "thus the length of the electron transport chain is crucial in deciding on stability of the equilibrium .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that the coupling of electron transfer to a membrane potential  a negative feedback loop  can serve to destabilise the unique equilibrium in these systems .",
    "interestingly , when the reaction rates are monotonic functions of a sum of potentials , then the system in any dimension could be proved to be everywhere hurwitz .",
    "reaction rates can not in general be seen in this way , but in the case of reactions which are primarily about charge transfer , the assumption could be reasonable . certainly some of the choices of reaction rates in numerical models such as @xcite satisfy this assumption .",
    "there are some interesting open questions , both biological and mathematical . from a biological point of view",
    ", it is of interest to find out whether experiments on mitochondria with constant inputs ever display behaviour other than convergence to an equilibrium , such as periodic or chaotic behaviour .",
    "if this is never the case , then this suggests that our very general model may be omitting certain important biological / thermodynamic restrictions on the reaction rates , which would tend to stabilise the system .",
    "it would also be interesting to see how additional processes such as transport processes in the full numerical models ( @xcite , @xcite for example ) affect the conclusions presented here .",
    "an open mathematical question is whether there are equivalent conditions to the ordering condition in 3d which ensure that the jacobian of the system is hurwitz in arbitrary dimension , or better still that the second additive compound has negative logarithmic norm , and hence the unique equilibrium is globally stable .",
    "if such conditions exist can they be given general biological meanings ?",
    "it would also be interesting to explore when the results presented here survive weakening of the assumption that electrons are transferred along a chain .",
    "although electron transfers taking place in the mitochondrial membrane are often described via a `` chain '' it is likely that this description is a convenient simplification rather than the whole truth .",
    "general electron transfer networks in the absence of a potential were analysed in @xcite and found to have simple behaviour .",
    "application of the theory presented in @xcite should allow determination of when these networks give rise to @xmath92 jacobians when interacting with a membrane potential .    finally ,",
    "although conditions ensuring sign - symmetry of the system imply that the jacobian is everywhere hurwitz , it is an open question as to whether this implies global stability of the unique equilibrium . since the markus - yamabe conjecture does not hold in dimensions greater than 2 @xcite , global stability does not follow automatically from local stability , and requires independent proof .",
    "a square matrix is defined to be * hurwitz stable * if all its eigenvalues lie in the open left half of the complex plane ",
