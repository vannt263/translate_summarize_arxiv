    "the list of multiple image gravitational lens systems has been growing steadily since the discovery of the first lens system ( walsh , carswell , & weymann 1979 ) . at present ,",
    "about thirty multiple image systems are confirmed or very likely to be gravitationally lensed systems ( see e.g. , surdej & soucail 1994 ; keeton & kochanek 1996 ) .",
    "these lens systems can provide us with information about the universe as a whole and the mass distribution within .",
    "turner , ostriker , & gott ( 1984 ; hereafter tog ) did extensive studies on the statistical nature of gravitational lenses and their implications for cosmology and galaxy formation .",
    "one of the results of this work was that the mean image separations of lens systems have different dependences on the source redshift in different cosmologies and that it may therefore be possible to measure the curvature of the universe directly .",
    "gott , park , & lee ( 1989 ; hereafter gpl ) explored the lens statistics in more general cosmologies where the cosmological constant @xmath6 is not zero .",
    "they showed that the then - available data ruled out extreme closed models having antipodal redshift @xmath7 , and the deceleration parameter @xmath8 .",
    "as the list of lenses grows , it has been applied to variety of problems .",
    "one prominent application is to place limits on the cosmological constant . with the observed galaxy mass distribution and number density , a universe with large cosmological",
    "constant should produce more multiple image systems than are actually observed .",
    "this has placed steadily improving limits on the cosmological constant : @xmath9 ( fukugita et al .",
    "1992 ) or @xmath10 ( kochanek 1996 ) where @xmath11 and @xmath12 the hubble constant .",
    "this limit is already strong enough to place telling constraints on an otherwise appealing cosmological model ( @xmath13 , @xmath0 , see ostriker & steinhardt 1995 for summary ) where @xmath14 .",
    "in addition , maoz and rix ( 1993 ) investigated the effects of the mass distribution in e / s0 galaxies and concluded that the hst snapshot survey data requires e / s0 galaxies to have significant halos .",
    "further studies of galaxy merger / evolution show that only some specific merger models can be rejected , and the above limit on @xmath6 is not affected ( rix et al .",
    "1994 ; mao & kochanek 1994 )",
    ". however , most applications of gravitational lensing statistics do assume specific mass ( or velocity dispersion ) distributions for lensing galaxies , e.g. , a schechter luminosity function and a luminosity - velocity relation , and specific number density distributions , e.g. , a constant comoving density of galaxies .",
    "in this work , we focus on the image separations versus the source redshift of the current multiple image lens systems to see whether it is consistent with the ` standard ' lensing statistics models .",
    "we find that the image separations are strongly negatively correlated with the source redshift , which is incompatible with the ` standard ' lensing statistics model in a flat universe .",
    "we explore possible causes to see if this correlation can be explained .",
    "we also update the limit on the deceleration parameter @xmath15 with the current data .",
    "the list of multiple image qso and radio sources has grown through systematic optical and radio surveys and through serendipitous discoveries .",
    "keeton and kochanek ( 1996 ; also see surdej & soucail 1994 ) summarize the data on the 29 relatively secure multiple image lens systems .",
    "they classify these systems into three grades of secureness : class a for `` i d bet my life this is a lens . '' , class b for `` i d bet your life this is a lens . '' , and class c for `` you should worry if i m betting your life . '' , all of which ( a , b , and c ) show convincing spectral similarities and identical redshifts ( table 1 for references ) and have separations which are either quite similar to 0957 which is surely a lens ( having the time delay between its two images measured recently [ kundi et al .",
    "1996 ] ) or smaller separations .",
    "also , note that the largest separation lens system 2345 ( in class c ) now has more observational support for being a true lens  its lens has been found ( fischer et al .",
    "1994 ) . in this work",
    ", we use all 20 systems in this list ( a , b , and c ) which have a known source redshift .",
    "the system 2237 + 0305 ( huchra et al . 1985 ) is not included because in that system the source ( qso ) was found after the lens .",
    "such systems would have different statistical properties than systems where the source is discovered first .",
    "these 20 systems are listed in table 1 and their maximum image separations , @xmath16 , are plotted against source redshift , @xmath17 , in figure 1 ( class a as circles , class b as triangles , and class c as crosses ) .",
    "they show visually quite a strong negative correlation between @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the major source of this correlation is a number of small redshift ( @xmath18 ) , large separation ( @xmath19 ) lens systems ( 2345 , 1120 , 0240 , 0957 , 1429 ) and large redshift ( @xmath20 ) , small separation ( @xmath21 ) , lens systems ( 1208 , j03.13 ) .",
    "( this effect was noted by gott [ 1997 ] .",
    "the original data [ 7 qso s ] in gpl showed no significant correlation . )",
    "of course there is always a possibility of contamination by `` false '' lenses , i.e. , observing real physical pairs of qso s , at wide separation at small source redshift due to quasar clustering ( which might be larger at low source redshift ) .",
    "we can roughly estimate how many qso physical pairs might be expected to show up as `` false '' lenses .",
    "djorgovski ( 1991 ) lists 3 quasar pairs ( or triplets ) with arcmin - scale separations and @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the redshift difference between quasars : qq 0107 - 025 ab ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) , qq 1146 + 111 bc ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) , and hoag 1,2,3 ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 ) .",
    "this number roughly agrees with the covariance function @xmath32 expected for gravitational clustering with the average comoving density of quasars @xmath33 and a correlation length @xmath34 . from the power law shape of @xmath35 ,",
    "the existence of two qso pairs within @xmath36 implies that we would expect to see roughly 0.06 qso pairs in the interval @xmath37 .",
    "hence , the contamination would be unimportant if qso pairs follow the covariance function expected for the hierarchical clustering .",
    "however , djorgovski ( 1991 ) also lists 3 qso pairs with arcsec - scale separation and @xmath22 , which are about two orders of magnitude over - abundant relative to the prediction of hierarchical clustering : pks 1145 - 071 ab ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) , 0151 + 048 ab ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 ) , and qq 1343 + 266 ab ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) . among these",
    ", only the 1145 ab pair has the required spectral similarities in the optical to be confused with a lens ( djorgovski et al .",
    "1987 ) and which is within the @xmath44 interval .",
    "if we regard 0957 and 2345 as the only proven gravitational lensed cases with @xmath45 , the a priori probability that a given qso pair with @xmath44 with similar spectra is a gravitational lens rather than a physical pair is 2 in 3 ( because of the decided cases 0957 and 2345 are lenses while 1145 is not ) . hence , the probability that all three remaining systems ( 1120 , 0240 , 1429 ) in table 1 within @xmath44 are just physical pairs ( even if one disregards all other observations ) is @xmath46 , which is less than 5% .",
    "the probability that two specific systems ( for example , 1120 and 0240 ) are physical pairs is @xmath47 , and the probability that one specific system is physical pair is @xmath48 .",
    "the quantitative aspects of possible contamination of a few `` false '' cases is discussed later .",
    "so for the time being , we are treating all 20 cases in table 1 as real gravitational lens systems .",
    "one of the most important cosmological parameters is the curvature of the universe .",
    "the friedmann big bang models admit three solutions : universes that are ( 1 ) flat , @xmath0 , with a euclidean three sphere space geometry @xmath49 at fixed epoch , ( 2 ) closed , @xmath50 , with a @xmath51 three space geometry at fixed epoch , and ( 3 ) open , @xmath1 , with a hyperbolic @xmath52 three space geometry at fixed epoch ( misner , thorne , & wheeler 1973 ) . we would very much like to know whether our universe is flat , closed or open so direct measurement of the curvature is extremely important .",
    "models with @xmath53 are open ( @xmath1 ) , models with @xmath54 are flat ( @xmath0 ) , and models with @xmath55 are closed ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "flat , @xmath0 models ( with @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) are popular with many people ( cf . ostriker & steinhardt 1995 ) because it could be produced naturally in any inflationary scenario where significantly more than 67-e - folds of inflation occurs and ( other than the theoretical problems with a finite @xmath6 term ) would require no fine tuning of parameters .",
    "but there are also open ( @xmath1 ) inflationary models .",
    "open inflationary universes , as suggested by gott ( 1982 ) , are created naturally during the decay of an initial metastable inflationary state .",
    "individual bubble universes are created which have an open geometry , with a negative curvature inherited from the bubble formation event .",
    "inflation continues within the bubble for approximately 67 e - folding times , creating a universe with a radius of curvature @xmath58 times larger than the wavelength of the microwave background photons , and which is uniform except for quantum fluctuations ( cf .",
    "gott & statler 1984 ; gott 1986 ; gott 1997 ) .",
    "the single - bubble open inflationary model ( gott 1982 ) has come under increased discussion recently because of a number of important developments . on the theoretical side , ratra & peebles ( 1994 , 1995 )",
    "have shown how to calculate the random quantum fluctuations in the @xmath52 hyperbolic geometry .",
    "this is very important since it allows predictions of fluctuations in the microwave background .",
    "bucher , goldhaber , & turok ( 1995a , b ) have done similar calculations , as well as yamamoto , sasaki , & tanaka ( 1995 ) .",
    "importantly , they have explained that the fine tuning in these models is only `` logarithmic '' and , therefore , not so serious .",
    "linde ( 1995 ) has shown how there are reasonable potentials which could produce such open universes , indeed different open bubble universes with different values of @xmath59 .",
    "the inflationary power spectrum with cdm ( bardeen , steinhardt , & turner 1983 ) has been amazingly successful in explaining the qualitative features of observed galaxy clustering including great walls and great attractors ( cf .",
    "geller & huchra 1989 ; park 1990a , b ; park & gott 1991 ) .",
    "the amount of large scale power seen in the observations suggests an inflationary cdm power spectrum with @xmath60 ( maddox et al .",
    "1990 ; saunders et al .",
    "1991 ; park et al . 1992 ; shectman et al . 1995 ; vogeley et al .",
    "a number of recent estimates of @xmath61 have been @xmath62 ( i.e. , @xmath63 [ riess , press , & kirshner 1995 ) , @xmath64 [ mould & freedman et al . 1996 ] , @xmath65 [ sandage et al . 1996 ] , and @xmath66 from the time delay of 418 days observed in 0957 [ kundi et al .",
    "1996 ] using the best model by grogin & narayan [ 1996 ] )",
    ". ages of globular cluster stars have a 2@xmath67 lower limit of about 11.6 billion years ( bolte & hogan 1995 ) ; if the age of the universe @xmath68 billion years , we require @xmath69 if @xmath70 and @xmath71 , but a more acceptable @xmath72 if @xmath56 , @xmath71 . models with low @xmath59 but @xmath54 are also acceptable . with the cobe normalization",
    "there is also the problem that with @xmath70 and @xmath71 , @xmath73 and this would require galaxies to be anti - biased [ since for galaxies @xmath74 and this would also lead to an excess of large - separation gravitational lenses over those observed ( cen et al .",
    "these things have forced even enthusiasts of @xmath0 models to move to models with @xmath75 but with a cosmological constant so that @xmath76 and @xmath0 .      in this paper , we will discuss a curvature test based on gravitational lens image separations as a function of source redshift .",
    "studies on statistics of lensing show that if a source is lensed by a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) galaxies , randomly distributed in the universe with constant comoving density , the mean separation  averaged over all possible lenses at different distances  of multiple images in a flat universe should be constant independent of the source redshift ( solid line in fig .",
    "however , the mean separation will decrease with source redshift in an open universe ( dotted and dashed lines in fig .",
    "2a ) and increase in a closed universe ( tog , gpl ) .",
    "in an open universe the volume increases faster with redshift than in a flat universe , and the source is more likely to be lensed by lensing galaxies at larger distances , which produces smaller image separations , and vice versa for a closed universe .",
    "this applies to lensing by galaxies and/or clusters both of which are well approximated by sis .",
    "also this test is independent of individual values of @xmath59 and @xmath77 when the universe is flat ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "this is quite important because it is a pure curvature test that distinguishes a @xmath0 cosmology from a @xmath1 cosmology .",
    "we have tests for @xmath59 : i.e. , peculiar velocities are proportional to @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the bias parameter , and power on large scales in galaxy scale clustering measures @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
    "but these tests do not distinguish between a model with @xmath82 , @xmath71 which is open ( @xmath1 ) and a model with the same value of @xmath59 but with @xmath54 which is flat ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "how can we distinguish between the @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath1 models , and the @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath0 models ?",
    "they produce galaxy clustering and masses of groups and clusters that are virtually indistinguishable .",
    "turner ( 1990 ) and fukugita , futamase , & kasai ( 1990 ) showed that a flat @xmath87 model produces about 10 times as many gravitational lenses than a flat model with @xmath88 . by comparing with the observed number of lenses , kochanek ( 1996 ) was able to set a 95% confidence lower limit of @xmath89 in flat models where @xmath54 , and a 90% confidence lower limit @xmath90 in open models with @xmath71 .",
    "thus , extreme-@xmath6 dominated models are ruled out by producing too many gravitational lenses .",
    "another possibility is future data on the cosmic background radiation for spherical harmonic modes from @xmath91 to @xmath92 : the @xmath70 , @xmath71 model reaches its peak value at @xmath93 ; an @xmath94 , @xmath95 model reaches its peak value at @xmath93 ( ratra et al . 1995 ) ; while an @xmath56 , @xmath71 model reaches its peak value at @xmath96 ( ratra & sugiyama 1995 ) .",
    "this can be measured by the map and cobras / samba satellites which will measure this range with high accuracy .",
    "the test in this paper ( gravitational lens separations as a function of source redshift ) is also able in principle to differentiate between an @xmath56 , @xmath71 , @xmath1 model and an @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath0 model .      for our gravitational lensing curvature test",
    "we first estimate the probability of producing the observed correlation by chance in a flat universe where the distribution of the separations is expected to be independent of the source redshift .",
    "since we do nt assume any specific distribution of image separations at a given redshift , we use spearman s rank correlation test .",
    "the student - t distribution gives the approximate probability for the random distribution to have stronger than a given correlation ( press et al .",
    "1992 ) . whenever there are ties , midranks are used .",
    "we checked this probability against monte - carlo simulations and they agree well .",
    "the two - sided probability ( of observing either a positive correlation or negative correlation as strong as that observed in fig .",
    "1 ) in a flat universe with sis galaxies is @xmath97 ( table 2 ) .",
    "this confirms the visual impression that the distribution is significantly ( negatively ) correlated with source redshift .",
    "we also divide the sample into three redshift intervals , @xmath98 $ ] , @xmath99 $ ] , and @xmath100 $ ] and apply the kolmogorov - smirnov test .",
    "the distribution of separations in @xmath98 $ ] and @xmath99 $ ] are not significantly different",
    ". however , those in @xmath98 $ ] and @xmath100 $ ] are statistically different with 95% confidence . if we are in a flat universe , this is a very special sample .    to see the possible effect of any `` false '' cases , we repeat the spearman test for the data set where",
    "some cases are excluded intentionally .",
    "for example , if we exclude any two large separation ( @xmath44 ) systems ( except 0957 , of course ) , the probability is small @xmath101 . excluding three systems , for example ,",
    "1120 , 0240 , 1429 , increases the probability only to @xmath102 .",
    "similarly even if the most favorable large separation and small separation case are excluded ( 1120 and 1208 ) , the probability is still small @xmath103 .",
    "only when two large separation and one small separation cases ( 1120 , 0240 , and 1208 ) are excluded , is @xmath104 . on the other hand , if two of the largest reshift cases ( 0952 and 1208 , both",
    "class b ) are excluded , the probabilty becomes quite significant , @xmath105 .",
    "so we conclude that three or more largest separation `` false '' cases or two or more largest redshift `` false '' cases are needed to change the incompatibility of the observed data with the standard lensing statistics model in a flat universe at the @xmath106 confidence level .    if it is not just a statistical fluke , what could be responsible for this correlation ?",
    "we first check if negative curvature can create this strong a trend .",
    "we try two open universes : an @xmath2 , @xmath71 empty universe and an @xmath107 , @xmath84 open universe .",
    "the mean image separation , @xmath108 , is calculated as a function of the source redshift @xmath17 ( in fig .",
    "2a : a dashed line for @xmath2 , @xmath71 and a dotted line for @xmath56 , @xmath71 ) .",
    "we then divide the observed image separations @xmath109 by expected mean separation @xmath110 .",
    "if the correlation is due to the curvature , these `` normalized '' separations should not show any correlation with @xmath17 .",
    "however , spearman tests indicate that in both the empty and @xmath107 open universes , significant correlations still exist , and the probability that the data could be randomly drawn from these empty and @xmath56 models is @xmath111 and @xmath112 , respectively ( table 2 ) .",
    "so although negative curvature lessens the strength of the correlation , it alone can not fully explain the correlation .",
    "we also test for the possible effect of `` false '' cases in @xmath56 open universe .",
    "exclusion of 1120 from the data set increases the probability to @xmath113 and of 1120 and 1429 to @xmath114 , while exclusion of 1120 and 0240 increases the probability to @xmath115 .",
    "also , exclusion of 1208 ( smallest separation ) increases the probability to @xmath116 , just above 5% level , although the correlation still exists .",
    "this is higher than the probability for the flat universe because some of the negative correlation would be explained by the curvature of the universe .",
    "it is also worth noting that if this is just a statistical fluke , we are about twice as likely to see it in an open universe ( with @xmath117 ) than in a flat universe ( with @xmath54 ) .",
    "other factors that can affect the distribution of image separations include the density profile of the lenses .",
    "the density profile of sis produces a constant bending angle regardless of the impact parameter , and the distribution of image separations is independent of the source redshift if lenses are uniformly distributed in a flat universe .",
    "if the density profile is steeper than sis , image separations decrease as the source redshift increases ( tog , gpl ) . to access the effect of a steeper density distribution",
    ", we try the extreme case of point mass lenses .",
    "in a flat universe , the mean separation of images produced by point mass lenses decreases by a factor of 0.82 from @xmath118 to @xmath119 .",
    "we again calculate @xmath110 ( fig .",
    "2b ) , normalize the observed image separation @xmath109 with it , and test for any correlation .",
    "the probability of finding either a positive correlation or a negative correlation as large as observed in this model is @xmath111 ( table 2 ) .",
    "so even this most extreme density profile can not explain the correlation .",
    "the next possibility is that of evolution of the lenses ( galaxies ) .",
    "if the number density or the mass of the lenses changes over cosmic time scales , this introduces a dependence of image separations on the source redshift : if the comoving number density increases with redshift , that is , more lenses per comoving volume at higher redshift , the mean separation decreases with source redshift .",
    "if the lens mass decreases with redshift , the mean separation again decreases with redshift .",

    "they focused on the lensing probability and the limits on the cosmological constant . under the generic relation between the velocity dispersion and mass of early - type galaxies , they find merging and/or evolution do not significantly change the statistics of lensing .",
    "we try three merger / infall models .",
    "the first merger model is that of broadhurst et al .",

    "the exact nature of excess of faint galaxy counts is uncertain at present .",

    "1996 ) [ with appropriate @xmath140 corrections ] of already formed galaxies rather than galaxy mergers . in this case , the lensing statistics would be unaffected .",
    "we use the broadhurst et al .",
    "model as simply an example of a rather severe merging scenario .",

    "this form implies that if we had @xmath145 galaxies at lookback time @xmath142 each with velocity dispersion @xmath67 they would by today have merged into 1 galaxy with velocity dispersion @xmath146^\\nu \\sigma$ ] .",

    "1994 ] for the discussion on the value of @xmath144 ) .",
    "this choice of parameters preserves the total probability of lensing and means that at galaxies @xmath153 were more numerous by a factor @xmath154 and that their velocity dispersion was smaller by @xmath155 than those at present with @xmath70 .",
    "since this description of merging depends directly on time rather than the redshift , the function @xmath145 depends on the individual values of @xmath59 and @xmath77 even in a flat universe .",
    "we take @xmath88 and @xmath71 as our exemplary flat universe . the mean separation as a function of source redshift",
    "is shown for this model in figure 2c as a dotted line .",
    "the spearman test shows that the broadhurst et al .",
    "merger model produces a probability of @xmath111 , proving that even this strong merging can not explain the observed correlation .",

    "only the combination of severe merging and extremely large @xmath6 ( one which would cause severe difficulties with the total number of lenses as discussed earlier ) marginally pushes the correlation below the 95% level .",
    "we also try a less extreme merger model in which the total mass of the galaxies within a given comoving volume is conserved but the comoving number density of galaxies goes like @xmath160 while mass of individual increases like @xmath161 where @xmath162 is the cosmic time since the big bang .",

    "the third model we try is a mass accretion model in which the comoving density of the galaxies is constant but the mass increases with @xmath161 as in the cosmological infall model ( as would occur if galaxies accreted gas by cosmological infall in an @xmath70 model ) .",
    "the total mass in galaxies thus increases with time and the total lensing optical depth is increased : @xmath167^{1/6}.\\ ] ] although different combinations of @xmath59 and @xmath77 in flat universe give different @xmath168 , the difference is practically negligible ( fig .",
    "2c , dot - dashed line ) . however , the open model produces a different @xmath168 ( fig .",
    "2c , long - dashed line ) because the effect due to merging is increased to by that due to the curvature .",
    "the spearman test for the flat universe has a probability of @xmath112 while that for @xmath56 , @xmath71 open universe @xmath169 .",
    "so even moderate mass accretion in an open universe can not produce the strong correlation seen in the data .",
    "since large image separations in some lens systems ( @xmath170 ) are too large to be explained comfortably within the currently accepted galaxy mass distributions , we expect these systems to be the result of galaxy lensing aided by a cluster as in the case of 0957 .",
    "we investigate what kind of effects would be expected if lensing is aided by a cluster .",
    "the cluster is simply modeled as a sheet constant mass surface density ( tog ) .    when multiple images are produced by an sis lens aided by a cluster , the lensing cross section is not affected but the image separation is widened ( tog ) , @xmath171 where @xmath172 is the separation by the sis plus cluster and @xmath173 that by the sis alone",
    ", @xmath174 is the surface mass density of the cluster , and @xmath175 $ ] is the critical surface mass density , where @xmath176 . thus the total lensing probability is unchanged , but the mean image separation is @xmath177    if one attributes the large separation lenses seen at small source redshift to a cluster helping a galaxy one might hope that the observed effect is due to a lack of clusters at large redshifts .",
    "can this be due to an evolution of clusters with redshift ?",
    "no . because nearby clusters help lensing for all more distant sources and even more effectively as the source redshift increases",
    "if there were no distant clusters beyond some redshift @xmath178 then this would have the effect of causing an _ increase _ in image separation with increasing source redshift .",
    "we assume two cases for the position of the cluster .",
    "for first , we assume the same redshift for the cluster and the lensing galaxy .",
    "the resulting mean image separation is shown in figure 2d for an @xmath70 , @xmath71 universe ( dotted line ) . the mean separation increases with source redshift because adding the cluster effectively makes the mass distribution even more extended than sis .",
    "for the second , the redshift of a cluster is at some fixed value smaller than the source redshift .",
    "the mean image separation in the same flat universe for this case is shown in figure 2d for the cluster redshift of 0.5 ( dashed line ) .",
    "it is also an increasing function of source redshift .",
    "this is expected because @xmath179 for any cluster is always smaller for a higher redshift source regardless of the lens redshift .",
    "therefore , for a given surface density , a cluster is closer to the critical surface density for more distant sources , and we expect larger image separations .",
    "this is just the opposite of the correlation seen in the data .",
    "it was hoped that the dependence of image separations of lens systems on the redshift of the source may make it possible to test the curvature of the universe directly ( tog ; gpl ) .",
    "however , the small number of the lens systems available makes this test very difficult ( gpl ) . here",
    "we examine how many multiple image lens systems are required to reliably test the curvature of the universe .",
    "since we are not sure that the observed distribution of the image separations , especially that of the large separation ones , is explained by a simple lensing model where the sources are lensed by a single galaxy following the schechter luminosity function , we do not use any assumptions on the lensing galaxies and use only the observed image separation distribution as the intrinsic distribution we are likely to discover in the future .",
    "although the observed data may contain the curvature effect already , we assume that the observed distribution is just the intrinsic one before being affected by the curvature .",
    "we create @xmath180 monte - carlo multiple images systems out of randomly shuffled images separations and source redshifts seen in the observed lens systems ( and listed in table 1 ) .",
    "this shuffled data set will have the same histogram of separations as observed and the same histogram of observed redshifts  but the redshifts and separations will be by definition uncorrelated as would be true in a flat model with sis lenses .",
    "then the image separations of the simulated samples are multiplied by the mean image separation at the simulated redshift expected in various cosmologies .",
    "we then run the spearman test on all simulated data sets to detect the existence of the negative correlation at above the 95% confidence level .",
    "we find that to distinguish the flat universe versus the empty universe at the 95% probability level requires 800 multiple image systems .",
    "proving a less extreme open universe like the @xmath56 , @xmath71 universe at the same 95% confidence level requires a staggering @xmath181 systems .",
    "this proves that pure curvature test from lens statistics is harder than originally expected mainly because the observed scatter in image separations is larger than initially expected . yet",
    "it might well be within the reach of future sky surveys ( sloan digital sky survey expects to discover @xmath182 new lenses in its spectroscopic survey , and about 1000 new lenses from its faint quasar candidate list based on their stellar type images but qso type colors .",
    "this is how many such lenses would be expected to be confirmed by later spectra from these candidates using other telescopes .",
    "[ sdss collaboration : nasa proposal 1997 ] ) .",
    "gpl discovered that in a @xmath183 universe where the observer s antipode is within the particle horizon , a source just beyond the antipode is over - focused due to the lensing action of the universe as a whole and can not create multiple images under most lensing mass distributions , e.g. , sis , sis with external shear , and elliptical potential .",
    "hence , the existence of ordinary multiple image lens systems at various source redshifts up to some maximum in general constrains the antipode to be farther away than the largest observed redshift multiple lens system source ( now at @xmath184 ) .",
    "( see gpl for details . )",
    "this limit on the antipodal redshift ( now @xmath185 ) revises the allowed parameter space in @xmath59 vs. @xmath15 ( the unshaded region in fig .",
    "we also provide a graph ( fig .",
    "4 ) for the lower limit on @xmath15 as a function of the antipodal redshift , so as new record breaking ( in @xmath17 ) lensed qso s are discovered , the lower limit on @xmath15 can be revised upward accordingly .",
    "we find that the currently observed multiple image lens systems show a very strong negative correlation between the image separation and the redshift of the source in the sense that larger redshift sources have smaller separations .",
    "the probability of this occurring in a flat universe with standard non - evolving galaxies is only 1% .",
    "possible causes are investigated : the curvature of the universe , different mass profiles for lensing galaxies , merger or accretion of galaxies , and lensing aided by clusters .",
    "although all of these except the lensing - aided - by - clusters model can create a negative correlation between the separations and the source redshifts , none of them produce a negative correlation as strong as that seen in the data .",
    "this leaves us with a puzzle .",
    "if there is a cause ( not explored in this work ) that can explain the correlation , it has to have very strong evolutionary effects , especially between @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "interstellar dust in younger galaxies causing obscuration is not helpful .",
    "obscuration might prevent us from seeing some high redshift qso s ( see malhotra , rhoads , & turner 1996 about the evidence for dusty gravitational lenses ) .",
    "but in analyzing the separation versus redshift question we are only dealing with the ones we do see . if there is dust in the lensing galaxies we would expect it to knock out small separation cases preferentially and if dust increases with increasing redshift in lensing galaxies as we would expect , then this would cause separations to increase slightly with increasing source redshift , which is the opposite of what we observe .",
    "are there any observational selection effects that would produce the effect ?",
    "it is not easy to think of one .",
    "one of the small separation large redshift cases ( 1208 ) was discovered with the hubble space telescope which is better able to discover small separation cases than ground based telescopes .",
    "but of course the space telescope is equally well able to discover small source redshifts .",
    "the hst snapshot survey includes both small and large separation cases and both small and large redshift cases : 0957 , 0142 , 1115 , 1413 , 1208 , and 1120",
    "( maoz et al . 1993 ) . as a matter of fact",
    ", even this small number of systems shows a very strong correlation ( a two - sided probability that they are drawn from a random data sample in a flat universe is @xmath188 ) .",
    "many lenses are found by the vla where the source redshift is found only after the confirming spectra are taken .",
    "the vla can detect separations as small as @xmath189 and qso s at any redshift .",
    "optical surveys simply stumble on cases and might miss some small separation cases but again would be expected to find large and small source redshifts equally well .",
    "therefore , it is hard to think of a selection effect that would be biased against detection of large separation , large redshift quasars only and which would be present in hst observations , vla observations , and ground based optical observations .",
    "one possible , yet unlikely , explanation of the observed correlation may be `` false '' gravitational lenses .",
    "we have shown that if three or more of the largest separation cases or two or more of the largest redshift ( small separation ) cases turn out not to be true lenses , the probability of having as strong a correlation as that seen in the data increases above 5% level in a flat universe .",
    "smaller number of `` false '' cases would do the same for an open universe .",
    "however , most of the lens cases in table 1 have been on the list for more than a few years without being disconfirmed . also , even if the probability is above 5% , it has to be multiplied to the additional likelihood that the specific cases are `` false '' lenses and the final probability would be very small .",
    "so it seems unlikely that three or more large separation cases or two or more large redshift cases will turn out to be just physical pairs and at the same time the correlation is from random distribution .",
    "however , the likelihood would be larger in an open universe : a single `` false '' lens ( 1208 ) and @xmath190 of chance in an @xmath56 , @xmath191 universe could produce a correlation as strong as that seen in the data .",
    "needless to say , either stronger confirmation or disconfirmation of large separation cases and large redshift cases through future observations would be very helpful .    if this negative correlation is real ( i.e. , not just a statistical fluke , or an observational selection effect , or due to``false '' lens contamination ) we may have to revise various conclusions . for example the limit on @xmath77 ( fukugita & turner 1991 ; fukugita et al .",
    "1992 ; kochanek 1996 ) may have to be weakened because its hypothesis ( constant comoving density unevolving sis lenses , flat universe ) would be wrong .",
    "on the other hand , if the current sample is a statistical fluke , then the observed lens systems must constitute a non - typical subset of the parent population and the limit of @xmath77 would also have to be weakened for the reason that our current sample is not a fair sample .",
    "the same thing can be said if the correlation is due to unknown observational selection effects or if the lens sample is contaminated with `` false '' cases .",
    "it is worth noting that if the negative correlation is just a statistical fluke we would be twice as likely to observe such an anomaly in an open universe with @xmath1 and @xmath117 as we would be to observe it in a flat @xmath0 universe with @xmath54 .",
