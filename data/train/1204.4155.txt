    "in  @xcite we have considered the possibility of realizing inflation from the standard model higgs sector , using the fact that the higgs potential has a local minimum between @xmath0 gev , which exists for a narrow band of the top and higgs mass values @xcite . not only such a local minimum exists but , within the allowed parameter range in the higgs and top masses , its energy density has the right value ( gut scale ) to give rise to the correct amplitude of density perturbations from inflation .    in order to get successful exit from inflation",
    "we have embedded the standard model in a scalar - tensor theory of gravity .",
    "more precisely we have used two ingredients : ( i ) the existence of a false vacuum in the higgs potential which can source exponential expansion in the early universe ; this gives rise to a combined prediction on the higgs mass @xmath8 , the top quark mass @xmath9 and the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations from inflation @xmath2 , all of which can be experimentally checked in the near future ( ii ) the possibility of achieving a transition from an exponential expansion to a hot radiation era by adding an extra scalar in the gravitational sector of the theory , which slows down the expansion allowing a tunneling of the higgs field .    in",
    "@xcite we have pointed out that the combined predictions on @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath2 are generic and independent on the way in which the exit from inflation is realized , as long as the height of the potential , at the time at which density perturbations are produced , is given by the sm higgs field .",
    "so , the ingredient ( ii ) can be changed , affecting only the prediction on the spectral index of density perturbations @xmath10 .",
    "in fact we present here an alternative model within standard einstein gravity which also provides a graceful exit from inflation and gives rise to a radiation era , without affecting the ingredient ( i ) and its predictions .    in order to achieve enough inflation",
    "it is necessary to have the higgs field @xmath11 trapped at a value @xmath12 of order @xmath0 gev with a suppressed tunneling rate ( @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the tunneling probability per unit time and volume and @xmath15 is the hubble rate ) and then it is necessary , after at least 60 e - folds , to trigger a phase transition through an additional scalar which plays the role of a clock , so that @xmath11 is not stuck at @xmath12 anymore , either exiting through tunneling or through classical roll .",
    "when this happens the field @xmath11 can roll down fast to smaller values , ending thus inflation , and eventually oscillate around zero and dissipate energy , producing thus a hot plasma , and finally relax at its true minimum at the usual field value @xmath16 gev .",
    "there are two ways to get such a behavior : ( a ) the tunneling rate @xmath14 is constant and smaller than @xmath15 during inflation and then @xmath15 has to decrease until at some time @xmath17 , so that an efficient phase transition can occur through bubble nucleation ; this is what we have proposed in  @xcite , based on  @xcite , using a brans - dicke scalar @xmath18 which evolves and slows down the expansion ; ( b ) @xmath14 is time - dependent while the hubble rate stays roughly constant , which can be realized in usual einstein gravity ; here the higgs field interacts directly with some additional degree of freedom @xmath19 ; such a field has a time evolution and modifies slightly the shape of the barrier so that at some specific value @xmath20 the higgs can tunnel or even just classically roll down .    in the present paper",
    "we introduce the possibility ( b ) , similarly to what happens in the so - called hybrid inflation scenarios  @xcite , where a `` waterfall '' field is trapped at zero value and can start evolve suddenly when another field ( in this case @xmath19 ) reaches some trigger value @xmath20 .",
    "the difference here is that we consider the trapped field to be the standard model higgs field , which is stuck at a very large value @xmath12 , instead of being trapped in zero .",
    "such a possibility could be viewed as less minimal than the one proposed previously in  @xcite because it introduces an explicit coupling between the higgs field and the extra field @xmath19 , which could potentially alter significantly the standard model and in particular it could change the rge themselves and so the existence or location of the false vacuum .",
    "however , as we will see , the coupling needs to be very weak and the mass of @xmath19 very large , so the contribution to the rge is practically zero , leaving thus the connection between low - energy parameters ( @xmath8 and @xmath21 ) and the false vacuum unchanged .",
    "moreover while the case analyzed in  @xcite has the virtue of having only gravitational couplings and of having a rather sharp prediction on the spectral index of density perturbations @xmath10 , nonetheless it has the complication that the additional brans - dicke field goes to very large values and it is necessary to introduce some additional explicit potential , in order to make @xmath18 roll down again towards zero value after inflation , so that fifth - force constraints due to an extra light scalar can be satisfied .",
    "this introduces some model - dependence in the post - inflationary evolution and features an uncertainty on the number of e - folds needed . in the case",
    "we present here instead there is no problem with the late - time behavior of @xmath19 , because gravity is standard .",
    "moreover it is also worth to note that hybrid inflation has the feature that it can avoid the fields to have superplanckian excursions during inflation , which is usually what happens in simple single - field slow - roll models , and also what happened in our model @xcite for the field @xmath18 .",
    "while we share the point of view that this is not necessarily a problem , because in any case the energy densities are always smaller than planckian ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite , sect.2.4 for a discussion ) , we note the interesting fact that we can have two regimes , depending on the higgs mass .",
    "as we are going to show in fact , we can get inflation to work with subplanckian field excursion only for low values of @xmath8 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ model ]",
    "we present the inflationary model , with the higgs field and an extra field @xmath19 .",
    "we impose the constraints that the @xmath19 field has to slowly roll down its potential for enough e - folds and has to generate the correct amplitude of density perturbations .",
    "we then compute the spectral index @xmath10 as a function of the parameters and show the regions of parameter space consistent with all observations for various values of @xmath22 . in section [ classical ]",
    "we show that introducing a small coupling between the potential barrier along the higgs field direction can be erased efficiently .",
    "we finally draw our conclusions in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "we consider here the usual standard model higgs field potential v_higgs()= ( ^2-v_^2)^2 , including quantum corrections due to the running of its quartic coupling @xmath23 , as in  @xcite .",
    "it is known that for a narrow range in parameter space @xmath22 there is a new local minimum at a value @xmath12 , at very high energies  @xcite .",
    "such a range is realized along a line in parameter space m_t [ gev]=111.835 + 0.479 m_h [ gev ] where an error of about 3 gev on @xmath8 is present due to theoretical uncertainties on the rge .",
    "we assume that the higgs field @xmath11 starts trapped in a cold coherent state in this false minimum , so that the universe is dominated by the potential energy @xmath24 and thus can inflate .",
    "it is however necessary to end inflation and have a transition to a radiation dominated era and in order to do that we introduce here a new scalar field @xmath19 which is very weakly coupled to the standard model higgs .",
    "such additional field @xmath19 evolves with time and makes the barrier in @xmath25 disappear after at least @xmath26 e - folds .",
    "this can be achieved if the evolution of @xmath19 is sufficiently slow and it is similar to what happens in the hybrid inflation scenarios , although usually the `` waterfall '' field is trapped at zero value , while here we consider a very large value @xmath12 .",
    "in fact we assume that @xmath19 is coupled to the higgs field in such a way that , when it reaches a value @xmath20 , the false minimum is erased and the higgs can start rolling down its potential . the simplest interaction term that we can introduce among the two fields is : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is some dimensionless parameter . in order to make the higgs potential steeper and",
    "so erase the barrier , we have two options : ( i ) @xmath28 positive and @xmath19 growing from zero to large values or ( ii ) @xmath28 negative and @xmath19 decreasing from large to zero value .",
    "we study here the first option , which would be analogous to so - called inverted hybrid inflation scenario  @xcite .",
    "note that the interaction term @xmath29 acts as a positive mass for @xmath19 , while we would want the field to be unstable .",
    "for this reason we introduce self - interactions @xmath30 so that @xmath19 can have a negative squared mass and so start close to zero and then increase : @xmath31 hence , for the full scalar potential we would get @xmath32 where we have also shifted the interaction term @xmath33 in such a way that its vacuum expectation value vanishes when @xmath34 thus recovering the usual standard model .",
    "we assume that the tunneling rate in the @xmath11 direction is very small initially , which can be obtained by tuning the barrier in @xmath35 varying @xmath8 and @xmath9 , as we are going to show in the next section .",
    "so we can consider @xmath36 during inflation .",
    "we also assume that initially @xmath19 starts very close to zero .",
    "we take as the initial value @xmath37 which is the minimum value given by quantum fluctuations .",
    "the squared mass term for the field @xmath19 is simply given by @xmath38 we assume now @xmath39 ( we will check later that this is consistent ) , so that the squared mass initially is just : @xmath40 so that the potential for the field @xmath19 is tachyonic initially provided that @xmath41 we can also rewrite the potential when @xmath42 as : @xmath43    we also assume that @xmath44 so that the energy density stored in @xmath35 is much larger than the one in @xmath45 , otherwise we would simply have a single - field slow - roll model in the @xmath19 direction , which does not use the existence of the false minimum in the higgs potential and which can work only for superplanckian field values .",
    "if the higgs dominates , then the hubble rate @xmath46 during inflation is practically exactly constant and given by : h_i^2 , where @xmath47 is the reduced planck mass , @xmath48 gev . in particular the value of the potential",
    "is related to the higgs mass via the approximate relationship : @xmath49= 4.867 \\,\\,{\\rm log}_{10 }   \\left (   v^{1/4}_{\\rm higgs } ( \\chi_0 ) [ { \\rm gev } ]   \\right ) + 47.41 \\ , \\ , , \\ ] ] with the usual theoretical uncertainty of about 3 gev on @xmath8 .",
    "the height of the potential @xmath24 determines thus also the amount of gravitational waves from inflation .",
    "using the fact that the amplitude of the scalar density fluctuations is measured , this fixes the value of the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath2 to an observed value @xmath50 , given as a function of @xmath24 as in  @xcite and this leads to a prediction on @xmath2 given by : @xmath51= 1.21\\,\\ , { \\rm log}_{10}(r_0 ) + 127.84 \\,\\ , , % ( 4.867 log_{10}(r ) + 47.41 ) gev\\ ] ] again subject to the 3 gev uncertainty on @xmath8 .",
    "given such initial conditions , @xmath19 slowly rolls down towards its minimum @xmath52 according to the equation of motion @xmath53    the number of e - folds is computed starting from a given time @xmath54 is @xmath55 , since @xmath56 is constant .",
    "during such a stage adiabatic density and tensor fluctuations due to @xmath19 are produced , according to the the slow - roll parameters , given as usual by @xmath57 using the fact that @xmath58 , we know that @xmath59 must have a fixed value @xmath60 .",

    "@xmath73 . at this point",
    "the higgs field can go out of its false minimum and inflation ends , provided that the potential barrier in the higgs mass is such that it is erased when @xmath74 .",
    "we show in the next section that this can be obtained even with a very small @xmath28 , as given by the bound ( [ boundalpha ] ) .",
    "if instead the field @xmath19 has already stabilized at the constant value @xmath75 before that @xmath71 e - folds have passed , then the mechanism can not work .",
    "we have checked that at later stages the potential @xmath76 has a first derivative @xmath77 which is generically large ( since the typical scale of the problem is @xmath78 , which is much larger than @xmath15 ) except in the very fine tuned cases , which we have discarded , in which @xmath72 is very small .",
    "we have checked that such a derivative is very large , in the region of parameter space that we have considered , and that the field rolls down in a negligible number of e - folds .",
    "it is possible that the field tunnels along the @xmath11 direction , before rolling down classically . in this case",
    "the criterion for the end of inflation would be to have a tunneling rate per unit time and volume larger than @xmath79 .",
    "however analyzing in detail such dynamical process is beyond the scope of our paper .",
    "in fact this happens only at the end of inflation , which corresponds to very small scales today , and therefore not observable by any means in the spectrum of perturbations .",
    "the only way this could affect our predictions would be if the tunneling event takes place many e - folds before @xmath20 .",
    "we have checked this using an estimates of the tunneling rate of the type @xmath80 where @xmath47 is a typical scale of the problem , which we take to be @xmath78 .",
    "here we have estimated @xmath81 using two different mechanisms : the coleman instanton  @xcite , where @xmath81 is the classical bounce action along the @xmath11 direction ( note anyway that this is only a qualitative procedure , as the problem becomes a two - field tunneling problem and rigorously we should consider both directions in field space when finding a classical bounce ) and the hawking - moss instanton where @xmath82 , where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are the locations of the maximum and the minimum along the @xmath11 direction respectively  @xcite .",
    "using both estimates we have checked that @xmath14 becomes of order @xmath79 only a fraction of e - folds before the classical roll , so that our approximations is reliable for our purposes .",

    "since the higgs potential is steep , we can assume that when the barrier disappears the higgs field rapidly rolls down , dissipates energy and relaxes to @xmath129 gev .",
    "we assume therefore an instantaneous transition from exponential inflation to a radiation dominated phase with scale factor @xmath130 .",
    "note however that when the higgs starts to roll down classically also the @xmath19 field undergoes further evolution going from the value @xmath20 to the minimum @xmath131 .",
    "the evolution can be solved assuming that the energy density of the higgs has been transformed into radiation , showing that the field @xmath19 undergoes oscillations about the minimum and therefore redshifts as matter .",
    "for this reason , at some point the field @xmath19 can also become dominant , although this depends on the amplitude of the oscillations , which is set by the initial value @xmath20 .",
    "as the universe expands the field @xmath19 would dominate the universe at some point , unless it decays before into relativistic degrees of freedom .",
    "the field @xmath19 is coupled to the higgs field via eq .",
    "( [ eq : potencialfacil ] ) and so it could decay into quanta of the higgs field , which are relativistic at high temperature when the higgs has relaxed in its minimum .",
    "the decay rate of the @xmath19 field could happen at least perturbatively by decaying into two quanta of the higgs field with a rate @xmath132 , where @xmath133 is some mass scale , but it could perhaps also decay more rapidly due to non - perturbative parametric resonance ; moreover we could also assume the field @xmath19 to have additional couplings which would make it decay rapidly .",
    "finally there is at least also the possibility of decaying through gravitational couplings  @xcite which have a rate @xmath134 , where @xmath135 . in any case",
    "it is easy to see that the field @xmath19 decays always before nucleosynthesis , at least through gravitational couplings and this happens when @xmath136 , which is realized at a temperature of about @xmath137 , always higher than about @xmath138 gev .",
    "it is however possible that the field decays much earlier by one of the above mentioned ways ; we leave such study for a more detailed future analysis .",
    "let us finally compute the number of e - folds @xmath71 needed to go from the time @xmath54 ( at the pivot scale taken to be @xmath70 mpc ) to the end of inflation , when the barrier for the higgs field disappears and the field can start rolling down its potential . at this point there is some model dependence which can shift @xmath71 by a few , due to the fact that the field @xmath19 can dominate and then decay , as discussed above .",
    "if we assume that @xmath19 can rapidly decay and never dominates we can easily compute @xmath71 : this is the regime which we have assumed in order to find the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - ns ] .",
    "let us then compute the time when a particular comoving scale @xmath139 went outside the horizon during inflation . in general a scale @xmath139 leaves the horizon at some e - folding number @xmath71 if : l ( ) e^- |n=|h_i^-1 , where the reheating temperature is simply given by @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the standard model number of degrees of freedom .",
    "this leads to a number of about 60 , depending on @xmath24 , which is determined by @xmath8 .",
    "the main conclusions of the paper are as follows : ( i ) it is possible to get inflation from the higgs field false vacuum energy density at @xmath142 , provided a second subdominant field @xmath19 with a mexican hat potential is ( very weakly ) coupled to the higgs field : the field @xmath19 rolls down its potential and when it reaches a value @xmath20 the barrier in the higgs potential is erased ( ii ) this is possible only if the energy scale is not too large and it leads to a bound on the tensor - to - scalar ratio given by @xmath143 ( iii ) such a window corresponds to an upper bound on the higgs mass @xmath144 gev where the @xmath4 is the present theoretical uncertainty on the standard model rges , which together with a lower bound coming from the experimental measurements of the top mass leads to an allowed window @xmath145 , which could be narrowed down to an interval of 2 gev by a better theoretical control of the rge .",
    "such a window corresponds to a range in the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath146 ( iii ) varying the parameters of the @xmath19 potential , values of the spectral index @xmath10 compatible with the observations can be obtained ( iv ) the @xmath19 field excursion is subplanckian only if the higgs mass is lower than about @xmath147 gev , which corresponds to @xmath148 .",
