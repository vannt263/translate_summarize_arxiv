    "let us state the definition of the minkowski sum of two sets @xmath0 .",
    "the _ minkowski sum _ is @xmath1    in this paper we consider minkowski sums in the plane .",
    "it is well - known , that the minkowski sum of two convex sets is again convex . in the case of convex polygons",
    "it is computed by a simple `` edge merging and slope sorting '' algorithm .",
    "if we consider non - convex polygons , the computation of the minkowski sum may require more complicated algorithms , see  @xcite for example . in the cited papers the problem of finding the minkowski sum arised from packing or motion planning problems .",
    "indeed , the set of possible shifts of a region @xmath2 , that intersect another region @xmath3 is the minkowski sum @xmath4 , where minus denotes the reflection w.r.t . the origin .",
    "the most straightforward way to find the minkowski sum of non - convex regions is to partition every non - convex region into convex polygons , calculate minkowski sums of parts , and then take the union  @xcite . in some practical applications , where the regions are essentially non - convex , this approach can be too complicated , in such cases it is convenient to use the intuitive `` orbital '' ( or `` sliding '' ) methods , see  @xcite .",
    "the latter methods deal with non - convex regions quite well , but the essential ( and hard ) part of these methods is finding `` holes '' in the minkowski sum .",
    "therefore , it is important to give a computable criterion for the minkowski sum to have no `` holes '' .    in section  [ definitions ]",
    "we define a measure of non - convexity @xmath5 for a simply - connected polygonal region ( simple polygon ) @xmath6 in the plane so that @xmath7 in general and @xmath8 iff @xmath6 is convex .",
    "this measure of non - convexity uses some essential properties of @xmath9 , some other definitions of non - convexity measures valid for spaces of arbitrary ( even infinite ) dimensions are reviewed in  @xcite .",
    "another general non - convexity measure based on the path metric in @xmath6 can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the main result is stated as follows .",
    "[ aconv - add ] suppose @xmath6 and @xmath10 are simple polygons , and @xmath11 .",
    "then @xmath12 is a simple polygon and @xmath13    this theorem shows that the property @xmath14 is stable under the minkowski sum , and in this case the sum of an arbitrary number of simple polygons is simple .    in the proof of theorem",
    "[ aconv - add ] we use the following fact , which has its own value .",
    "it generalizes the separation theorem for convex sets .",
    "[ aconv - sep ] suppose @xmath6 is a simple polygon with @xmath14 .",
    "then for any point @xmath15 there exist an angular region @xmath2 with apex @xmath16 , such that @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    "now we make some definitions and fix some notation .",
    "the sequence of points @xmath19 ( vertices ) and the corresponding segments @xmath20 ( edges ) is called a _",
    "polyline_. we require that the consecutive vertices do not coincide @xmath21 .",
    "for a polyline @xmath22 we call the sequence of vectors @xmath23 the _ shift sequence _ and denote it @xmath24 .",
    "we call a polyline @xmath25 _ closed _ if @xmath26 . in this case",
    "we often index its vertices modulo @xmath27 .",
    "we call a polyline _ simple _ if it has no self - intersections , i.e. its edges may intersect in one point if they are consecutive , otherwise they do not intersect . in a closed polyline",
    "we , of course , allow the first vertex to equal the last one .",
    "we call a compact set @xmath28 a _ simple polygon _ if its boundary is a closed simple polyline .",
    "it is obvious that generally the minkowski sum of two simple polygons can be not simple , speaking informally it can have `` holes '' .",
    "the objective of this paper is to find some sufficient conditions on the polygons that guarantee that the minkowski sum is simple .",
    "we need some more definitions .    for two plane vectors",
    "define the _ skew product _",

    "if the shift sequence of a polyline @xmath35 does not contain a consecutive pair of opposite vectors , we call @xmath35 _ non - reverse_.    let a polyline @xmath35 with shift sequence @xmath36 be non - reverse .",
    "the _ rotation _ of @xmath35 ( the same as rotation of @xmath24 ) is @xmath37 if the polyline has @xmath38 vertices we put @xmath39 .",
    "if the polyline @xmath35 is closed , then ( the indices are modulo @xmath27 ) @xmath40    let @xmath35 be a non - reverse polyline . denote the _ angular convexity _ of @xmath35 @xmath41 where the minimum is taken over subpolylines @xmath42 ( obtained from @xmath35 by removing some vertices from its front and/or its back ) .",

    "the angular convexity of a polygon @xmath6 is illustrated on its slope diagram ( dependance of the slope angle on the anticlockwise parameter ) in figure  [ slope - diag ]     is the full length . ]",
    "here we formulate and prove some lemmas that generalize the algorithm of finding minkowski sum for convex polygons by edge sorting .",
    "we start from the definition .",
    "denote the concatenation of sequences @xmath46 and @xmath47 by @xmath48 .",

    "assume the contrary : a point @xmath289 is not connected to @xmath251 in the complement of @xmath278 .",
    "let us perturb the vertices of @xmath6 and @xmath10 by values @xmath290 .",
    "if @xmath291 is chosen small enough then @xmath292 condition is kept , and @xmath16 remains outside @xmath278 . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath278 does not have a hole containing @xmath16 after perturbation , then the complement @xmath250 contains by theorem  [ aconv - sep ] an angular region @xmath2 with apex @xmath16 and bounded from below measure @xmath293 .",
    "hence for small enough @xmath291 the region @xmath2 can not be `` blocked '' by returning to the non - perturbed @xmath6 and @xmath10 , we have a contradiction .",
    "thus we have proved that for small enough ( @xmath290 ) perturbations of @xmath6 and @xmath10 their sum @xmath278 still has a hole .",
    "i.e. the property of having a hole is open .",
    "we are going to consider the parameterized family of polygons @xmath294 note that the edges of @xmath295 are contained in the lines ( we define lines by two points ) @xmath296 where @xmath297 and @xmath298 are vertices . by perturbing @xmath6 and @xmath10",
    "we may require that all such lines ( there is a finite number of them ) have different directions .",
    "we also require that when @xmath299 changes in the range @xmath300 , no @xmath301 of the lines meet at a single point , this can be achieved by perturbation .",
    "if the parameter @xmath299 is close enough to zero , then the polygon @xmath295 has the following structure : near an edge of @xmath6 it has a `` long '' edge , and near a vertex of @xmath6 it may be complicated .",
    "but since @xmath6 is an angular region @xmath302 ( possibly concave ) in some neighborhood of a vertex @xmath303 , then @xmath295 in @xmath304 ( and for small enough",
    "@xmath299 ) is a union of a family of translates of @xmath302 , that is starshaped .",
    "hence , for small enough @xmath299 , locally @xmath295 has the same topology as @xmath6 , and can not have holes in global .",
    "now consider @xmath305 it is already proved that @xmath306 , assume @xmath307 . since the `` has hole '' property is open , @xmath308 has no holes .",
    "consider what could happen if we increase @xmath299 by a small value @xmath290 . from the general position assumption @xmath295",
    "may be changed by adding some extra edge instead of a vertex , but this can not give a hole .",
    "hence @xmath309 and the proof is complete .",
