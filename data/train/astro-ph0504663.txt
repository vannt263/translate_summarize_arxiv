    "results of a fit for the c  iv  doublets in system  a , carried out manually ( as described in  4.1 , below ) , are given in table 1 .",
    "manual fitting was necessary because these doublets are so heavily blended with each other and with other lines that line fitting with minfit can not be applied . for the same reason ,",
    "the fit parameters for the si  ii@xmath201526 lines in system  b are evaluated in the same manner , with fitting errors evaluated with the help of the @xmath30 test . for all other doublets ,",
    "@xmath28  is a free parameter .",
    "we describe here two methods of determining that a given nal is intrinsic : ( a ) covering factor analysis and ( b ) time variability analysis .",
    "the covering factor , @xmath28 , is the line - of - sight coverage fraction of the absorber over the continuum source and the emission line region .",
    "the effective covering factor is evaluated by considering the fraction of photons from the background source(s ) intercepted by the absorbing gas .",
    "the normalized flux at wavelength @xmath20 is given by , @xmath31 + c_{f } ( \\lambda ) e^{-\\tau ( \\lambda)}\\ ; , \\label{eqn:1}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the optical depth at @xmath20 .",
    "for a resonant doublet such as c  iv  @xmath331548,1551 , the ratio of the oscillator strengths of blue and red members is 2 , as dictated by atomic physics .",
    "therefore we can evaluate the covering factors as a function of velocity for doublets using the following equation : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the residual fluxes of the blue and red members of the doublets in the normalized spectrum ( hamann et al .",
    "1997b ; barlow & sargent 1997 ; crenshaw et al .",
    "in general , the emission line region and continuum source could have different covering factors , as discussed by ganguly et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .    to strengthen our results ,",
    "we evaluate the covering factor using the following methods : ( i ) the _ pixel - by - pixel _ method  evaluating @xmath28 for each pixel [ using equation  ( [ eqn : cf ] ) ; e.g. , ganguly et al . 1999 ] , and ( ii ) the _ automatic fitting _ method  fitting absorption profiles using @xmath28 as well as @xmath25 , @xmath27 , and @xmath1 as free parameters in minfit ( e.g. , ganguly et al .",
    "unfortunately , neither of these two methods is applicable to system  a because of heavy self - blending ( i.e. , blending of the _ blue _ members of some doublets with the _ red _ members of other doublets ) .",
    "therefore we adopt a third method for this system , _ manual _ fitting , which we apply only to components 1 and 2 , where blending is not severe ( see figures  2 and 3 ) . in the manual fitting method",
    "we construct a simple model for the absorber with the same free parameters as in the minfit models .",
    "we then vary the free parameters over a wide range of values in small steps , assessing the goodness of the fit first by eye , and then by the @xmath37 test .",
    "the @xmath28 values with their 1@xmath29 `` poisson '' errors , evaluated by the automatic fitting method , except for the c  iv  doublets in system  a , are listed in tables 1 and 2 .",
    "the poisson errors are uncertainties in the model parameters resulting from only poisson noise in the spectra .",
    "there are additional sources of uncertainty , of course , which we discuss in detail below . in  5 we present the spectra and discuss the properties of the 8 c  iv  systems to which we have applied our analysis . in the case of system  a , we had to fit the profiles of components 1 and 2 manually .",
    "we estimated the poisson uncertainties for components 1 and 2 by scanning a range of values about the best fit for all interesting parameters and looking for a significant increase in @xmath37 ( see lampton , margon , & bowyer 1976 ) .",
    "the uncertainties , which are included in table  1 , are negligible compared to uncertainties resulting from continuum placement errors or line blending , which we discuss further below .",
    "the ultimate reason for the small poisson uncertainties in these two components is that the @xmath22 is high and the lines are relatively broad , spanning many pixels .",
    "our derived @xmath28  values are subject to a number of additional uncertainties .",
    "one such uncertainty results from line blending . if two or more components are blended together , a direct estimation of the @xmath28  value by the pixel - by - pixel method [ eqn  ( [ eqn : cf ] ) ] is not reliable . on the other hand ,",
    "the results from the automatic fitting method are still reliable , especially for strong doublets , as long as they are not affected by self - blending .",
    "to evaluate the systematic uncertainty in the latter method , we performed a line - deblending test in which we synthesized three artificial c  iv  doublets [ @xmath38 ; @xmath39  km  s@xmath0 ; @xmath28  = 0.5 ] separated by 100 km  s@xmath0  from each other , introduced them into an artificial spectrum with a @xmath22 similar to what we obtain in practice , and determined their line parameters with minfit .",
    "we repeated this test 500 times .",
    "the distribution of resulting covering factors for the stronger lines is very narrow and centered very close to the input values ; @xmath28  = 0.51@xmath400.06 and 0.51@xmath400.02 for doublets with @xmath41 and 14.5 .",
    "however , the spread in the measured value of @xmath28  is very large for weak doublets with @xmath42 . the outcome does not change significantly if we change the input @xmath28  values",
    "thus , the result from the automatic fitting method is still reliable , at least for strong doublets with @xmath43 , even if there is line blending ( but not self - blending ) .",
    "however , one must still attach a systematic error of @xmath44% to @xmath28 .",
    "continuum fitting also introduces an uncertainty in the derived values of @xmath28  because it affects the residual flux in the absorbed spectral regions .",
    "we estimated an upper limit to the uncertainty in @xmath28resulting from continuum fitting errors through the following simulation : we shifted the normalized continuum level around the red member of the c  iv  doublet by the average noise level of the observed spectrum [ @xmath45 while keeping the continuum level around the blue doublet member fixed and we investigated what the new value of @xmath28  turns out to be , _ under the assumption that @xmath28  was originally equal to 1_. from this exercise we found that we obtain @xmath28  values 0.98 , 0.93 , 0.82 , 0.56 , and 0.13 ( instead of 1 ) for normalized residual fluxes at the center of blue doublet member of 0.1 , 0.3 , 0.5 , 0.7 , and 0.9 , respectively .",
    "thus , we conclude that the @xmath28  values for strong doublets ( those with a normalized residual flux of @xmath46 ) are uncertain by @xmath47% .",
    "we regard this as an upper limit to the uncertainty because the effect of shifting the continuum on the value of @xmath28  is smaller if ( a ) we perturb the continuum around both doublet members , or ( b ) we assume that the original value of @xmath28  is less than unity . in table 3 , we summarize upper and lower 1@xmath29 errors on @xmath28  values in the case that @xmath28is less than unity .",
    "these were computed by shifting the continuum level only around the red member .",
    "column ( 1 ) gives the @xmath28  value and columns ( 2 ) ",
    "( 6 ) are the residual flux of the blue member of the doublet .",
    "we leave the entries blank for unphysical combinations of @xmath28  and @xmath48 .",
    "these tabulated values are the ones we adopt in our assessment of uncertainties .",
    "we also considered the uncertainty resulting from the convolution of the spectrum with the line spread function ( lsf ) of the spectrograph .",
    "this effect applies only to the pixel - by - pixel method ( since automatic fitting convolves with the lsf ) and was originally explored in the case of narrow doublets ( widths comparable to the lsf width ) by ganguly et al .",
    "we performed the same analysis as ganguly et al .",
    "but for broader doublets , because most doublets in our sample are much broader than the lsf .",
    "we found that for isolated lines that are much broader than the lsf , the @xmath28  values are evaluated correctly within a window around the line center whose width is twice the gaussian broadening parameter ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "this conclusion depends slightly on the line strength and width and is not valid if the doublet members are blended with each other ( `` self - blending '' ) .",
    "outside of this window , the @xmath28  values are underestimated , and can reach 0 in the far wings of the line . in these regions both the numerator and the denominator of equation  ( [ eqn : cf ] ) are very close to zero , therefore , the @xmath28values obtained with the pixel - by - pixel method are sensitive to the pixel width , the noise , and the resampling and interpolation schemes used in the calculation .",
    "considering all of the sources of error discussed above , the pixel - by - pixel method yields reliable results for our data in only very few cases . in the figures presented below , we plot the values of @xmath28  from the pixel - by - pixel method only in the rare cases where their uncertainties are reasonably small",
    "otherwise , we rely solely on the value of @xmath28  derived by fitting the line profiles ( either manually or using minfit ) .",
    "the detection of time variability of absorption line properties such as strengths , profiles , and shift velocities is another reliable method for identifying intrinsic nals .",
    "variability of absorption lines has been reported for a few seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , kraemer et al . 2002 ) and quasars ( e.g. , gallagher et al . 2004 ; hamann et al .",
    "recently , larger surveys looking for time variable nals have been carried out at @xmath50 ( narayanan et al .",
    "2004 ) and at @xmath51 ( wise et al .",
    "2004 ) , and they detected variable nals in 2 of 8 ( 25% ) and 4 of 15 ( 27% ) quasars respectively .",
    "these fractions , however , are lower limits , since these studies used low- to medium - resolution spectra and are thus sensitive only to large variations .    to search for spectral variability in hs1603 + 3820 , we overplotted selected regions of the spectra from the two epochs and inspected them by eye ( cf , hamann et al .",
    "this simple method is quite adequate because our spectra have a fairly high resolution and @xmath22 so that even small changes are obvious to the eye . in summary , we found substantial variations in system a ( figure 4 ) but not in any other absorption system ( figure 5 ) .",
    "we describe these changes along with other results in the following section .",
    "possible causes of variability are : ( a ) a change of ionization state , and ( b ) a motion of the absorbing gas across the line of sight .",
    "we discuss these possibilities further in  6 .",
    "we found 47 c  iv , 14 si  iv , and 6 n  v  doublets , as well as another 54 single metal lines , such as al  ii , fe  ii , and si  ii , between @xmath1  = 1.88 ( @xmath2  = 60,400 km  s@xmath0 ) and @xmath1  = 2.55 ( @xmath2  = @xmath52950 km  s@xmath0 ) . for simplicity , we grouped the 121 components into 8 absorption systems , which are discussed below .",
    "for the first four systems , which have already been discussed in m03 , we performed both covering factor analysis and time variability analysis . for the other systems , we applied only covering factor analysis .",
    "system a ( @xmath53 ; : :    @xmath54 8,30010,600 km  s@xmath0 ) this    system has many broad c  iv  doublets and some of them are self - blended ,    which makes the line profile very difficult to decompose into    kinematic components . in this case , the results from both the    pixel - by - pixel and the automatic fitting methods are unreliable .",
    "therefore , we concentrate on the wavelength region at    52905315    which can be decomposed relatively simply into two    kinematic components of c  iv  plus several narrow si  ii  lines , and    employ the manual fitting method described in  4.1 . if we assume full    coverage , the best - fit model for the red ( or blue ) doublet member    can not reproduce the observed spectrum around the blue ( or red )    doublet member , as we illustrate in the top panel of figure  2 using    the 2nd epoch spectrum as an example .",
    "thus , we resort to models with    partial coverage and we find coverage factors of    @xmath55 and @xmath56 for the first    and second epoch spectra respectively ( all sources of error included ) ,    i.e. , we find a @xmath57 change in @xmath28 .",
    "the uncertainties here are dominated by errors from line blending as    estimated by the line blending analysis in   4.1 ;",
    "uncertainties due to    continuum fitting ( since @xmath58 and    @xmath59 ; see table  3 ) and poisson noise are    negligible in comparison ( see  4.1 and table  1 ) .",
    "+    in the above analysis we assumed the same covering factors for the two    components .",
    "we were led to make this assumption for the following    reason : we first fitted the velocity region between @xmath60    and @xmath61  km  s@xmath0  with a broad    c  iv  component only and found that the required covering factor was    the same as that obtained for the narrow component after fitting a    2-component ( broad+narrow ) model . after obtaining the best fit with    the composite model we went back and relaxed the assumption that the    two components had the same covering factors .",
    "we explored the    consequences by perturbing the covering factors of the two components    about the best fit and adjusting the column density to compensate .    from this exercise we found",
    "that , if the covering factors are not    forced to be the same , they can deviate from the best fit by    @xmath62 in the first epoch spectrum and by    @xmath63 in the second epoch spectrum .",
    "if we treat these    deviations as an additional error on @xmath64 , we find that    the change in @xmath64 between the two epochs is    @xmath65 , which is still fairly significant .",
    "+    to illustrate the change in @xmath28  we plot the observed    line profiles from the two epochs in the second and third panels on    figure  2 with the best fitting models for a fixed value of    @xmath28=0.45 superposed ( all other parameters are free ) .    it is clear from this figure that the first - epoch profile can not be    fitted adequately using the same value of @xmath28  as the    second - epoch profile .",
    "we also plot the best fitting model to the    first - epoch spectrum with @xmath28  = 0.3 in the bottom    panel .",
    "+    in figure  3 we present a fit to the entire system a , including the    heavily blended region around 53155345   , for which we used the    manual fitting method and assumed a fixed value of    @xmath28=1 .",
    "the parameters obtained from this fit are    listed in table  1 , although they should be regarded as tentative    because of their large uncertainties .",
    "deriving the uncertainties for    these model parameters would have been extremely tedious and is not    central to the point of this paper .",
    "+    we identified 14 c  iv  doublets in this system , while d99 and m03 found    5 and 7 doublets , respectively .",
    "ly@xmath23 , n  v , and    si  iv  lines are also tentatively detected in our new spectrum .",
    "however , we can not fit those profiles with minfit , because they are    very broad and strong .",
    "the continuum fits in these regions are not    reliable .",
    "we can not even apply the interpolation technique described    in  2 , because echelle orders next to a given order are also affected    by ly@xmath23  forest .",
    "+    for comparison of line profiles between the 1st and 2nd spectra , we    also superimpose the two spectra in figure 4 .",

    "if this is the case for system  a , we can derive some constraints on the size , crossing velocity , and distance of the absorber from the uv - emitting source using a simplified model as follows .",
    "at first , we assume that both the continuum source and blr are background sources ( e.g. , ganguly et al .",
    "1999 ) . in this case",
    ", we can estimate the size of the blr to be @xmath95  pc by using the empirical relation between blr size and the quasar luminosity that was found through reverberation mapping analysis [ eqn  ( a3 ) in vestergaard 2002 ] . to apply this relation",
    ", we used the monochromatic continuum luminosity derived from the @xmath96 magnitude of hs1603 + 3820 , measured by d99 .",
    "this luminosity is strictly an upper limit because at the redshift of the quasar the @xmath96 filter includes a contribution from the ly@xmath23 and emission lines ; nevertheless , the luminosity is overestimated only by a factor of a few .",

    "the crossing velocities of the two c  iv  components in system  a ( components 1 and 3 in the 1st spectrum , or components 1 and 2 in the 2nd spectrum ) , for which we can evaluate reliable @xmath28  values in both spectra , would be @xmath99  km  s@xmath0 .",
    "this model is implausible , because the estimated speeds are much larger than the speed of light .",
    "thus , we must conclude that the absorber covers primarily the uv continuum source and only a small part of the blr .",
    "in fact , since the intensity of the broad c  iv  emission line at the location of system a is only about 10% of the continuum , the absorber giving rise to system  a need not cover the blr at all .",
    "therefore , we estimate the velocities by assuming that only the continuum source lies behind the absorbing clouds ( e.g. , wise et al .",
    "we take @xmath100 ( where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the schwarzschild radius and the mass of black hole ) as the continuum source size within which most of the uv continuum radiation is expected to originate .",
    "the central black hole mass is estimated by using an empirical relation that connects it to the uv luminosity and the width of the emission line [ eqn  ( 8) in vestergaard ( 2002 ) ] . the uv luminosity was estimated as described above , and the fwhm of the emission line ( 7,500  km  s@xmath0 ) was measured from the spectrum of d99 .",
    "the resulting black hole mass is @xmath103 , but we note that this value should be regarded with some caution because ( a ) the scatter about the empirical relation we have used can be as high as an order of magnitude , and ( b ) the luminosity we have adopted is strictly an upper limit to the true value .",
    "therefore , we believe that the black hole mass can be as low as a few @xmath104 . this model produces reasonable values of the crossing velocities , namely @xmath6  km  s@xmath0 , using the higher black hole mass .",
    "we may also use the black hole mass to estimate an upper limit to the distance of the absorber from the background source , by requiring that the observed shift velocity does not exceed the escape velocity at that radius . from this consideration",
    "we obtain @xmath105  pc .",
    "the above estimate of the crossing velocity can be used to argue against internal motions of the absorber as the origin of the change in the covering factor . assuming that the speed of internal motions is comparable to the speed of sound , @xmath106  km  s@xmath0(where @xmath107 is the temperature in units of @xmath108  k )",

    "in particular , by setting @xmath109 we obtain @xmath110  k , which is incompatible with the observed ionic species .",
    "we note , in conclusion , that using the size of the uv continuum source from the previous paragraph and the speed of sound for a @xmath108  k gas , a typical variability time scale due to internal gas motions would be of order 100 years .",
    "we can derive more stringent , albeit more speculative , constraints on the location of the absorber , if we adopt the dynamical model of murray et al .",
    "( 1995 ) for the radial and azimuthal motion of parcels of gas in an accretion - disk wind . following this model ,",
    "we assume that the velocity of the gas in the radial direction follows @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the launch radius of a specific gas parcel and @xmath113 is its terminal speed . combining this with conservation of angular momentum and the expression for the terminal speed given in chiang & murray ( 1996 ) we obtain the following relation for the radius of the gas parcel relative to its launch radius : @xmath114 + 1\\ ; , \\label{eqn:4}\\ ] ] where @xmath115 is the azimuthal speed of the parcel . to connect this expression to the observations",
    ", we identify the azimuthal velocity with the crossing velocity of the continuum source inferred from observations , i.e. @xmath116 . moreover , we can take the velocity of system  a to be the projection of the radial velocity along the line of sight , i.e. , @xmath117 .",
    "if the inclination of the accretion disk is not very small ( @xmath118 ) , we can use equation  ( [ eqn:4 ] ) to obtain an upper limit on @xmath119 .",
    "this limit will depend directly on the adopted mass of the black hole , since that determines the inferred crossing velocity . in view of the caveats associated with the estimated black hole mass , we choose to use the lowest plausible value , namely @xmath120 , which yields the most generous upper limit on the radius of the absorber , namely @xmath121 .",
    "the launch radius of the wind is expected to be within the inner , radiation - pressure supported part of the accretion disk , which for our inferred black hole mass and assuming an accretion rate close to the eddington limit , is @xmath122  cm ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; this is rather insensitive to the black hole mass ) .",
    "thus the constraint on the radius translates to @xmath123  pc .",
    "we also note that the conclusion that @xmath124 is in good agreement with the simulations of proga et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , which show the wind fragmenting into filaments fairly close to its launch radius .      the total equivalent width of system  a has doubled within 0.36 years in the quasar rest frame .",
    "this surprising growth is probably caused by ( i ) increase of column densities , and/or ( ii ) increase of the covering factors of the c  iv  doublets in the system , although the doppler parameters could also be partially responsible .",
    "if the equivalent width continues to increase steadily , system  a would satisfy all the requirements for a bal classification .    in order to predict future profiles",
    ", we synthesize spectra by changing the column densities or the covering factors of the c  iv  doublets in the system .",
    "unfortunately , we can not evaluate the column density and covering factor of each doublet exactly in the observed spectrum , since the c  iv  doublets are heavily blended with each other or with si  ii  lines from system  b. therefore , we convert the column densities of the c  iv  doublets in the 2nd spectrum in table 1 ( evaluated assuming @xmath28  = 0.45 or 1.0 ) to values assuming @xmath28  = 0.7 ( corresponding to the depth of the deepest c  iv  component ; we adopt this value for all components for simplicity ) , and use them below .",
    "we present simulated line profiles which are synthesized by multiplying the column densities by 0.5 , 1.0 , 2.0 , and 5.0 ( figure 13 ; here , covering factors are fixed ) , or by changing the covering factors , @xmath28  = 0.3 , 0.5 , 0.7 , and 0.9 ( figure 14 ; here , column densities are fixed ) .",

    "@xmath28  = 0.9 ) , the continuum flux is absorbed by at least 10% over a velocity range of @xmath9 2,000 km  s@xmath0 , which satisfies the definition of a bal .",
    "if the doppler parameters increase simultaneously , the blended c  iv  components make a smoother profile , whose appearance would be similar to those of bals . with additional spectra taken at regular intervals , we could probe the origin of time variability further ( i.e. , distinguish between a change of column density and a change in covering factor ) by comparing the observed line profiles with our simulations .          in systems c and d ,",
    "we detect neither time variability nor partial coverage with our spectra taken over a 1.28-year interval of observation , even though these would appear to be promising candidates for intrinsic systems because of their small shift velocities .",
    "there are at least three candidates for the origin of these systems .",
    "they can be produced in either ( i ) the quasar host galaxy , ( ii ) intervening galaxies in the vicinity of the quasar that are members of the same cluster ( or group ) of galaxies , or ( iii ) gas clouds intrinsically associated with the quasar that _ appear _ to be ejected ( system  c ) or infalling ( system  d ) ; these gas parcels can be part of a high altitude stream in an accretion disk wind ( which may be circulating ) as simulated by proga et al .",
    ".    however , since we do not see the hallmarks of intrinsic absorption in either of these two systems ( e.g. , partial coverage or time variability ) , we can not prove that they are intrinsic , nor can we rule this out .",
    "we find it unlikely that system  d is made up of undisturbed gas in the host galaxy because of its large velocity shift .",
    "the fact that the absorption troughs in system  d are black , suggests that this absorber covers both the continuum source and the broad - emission line region almost completely , i.e. , its transverse size could be a few pc ( cf ,  6.2 ) .",
    "this large size could also be responsible for the lack of variability , if this system is intrinsic .      among the 8 c  iv  systems ,",

    "if gas motion across the background uv source causes the variability in system  a , the crossing velocity and the distance from the continuum source are estimated to be @xmath6  km  s@xmath0 and @xmath7  pc , respectively . in this case , the blr can not contribute significantly to the background uv flux ( in fact , it need not contribute at all ) . if we adopt the dynamical model of murray et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , we obtain an additional relation for the radius of the gas parcel relative to its launch radius , which gives a more strict , although model - dependent , constraint of @xmath8 pc .",
    "* we argue that the appearance of system  a would be fairly similar to that of a bal system , if either the column densities of the c  iv  lines increase by factors of @xmath129 2 , or if their covering factors become larger than 0.9 .",
    "* systems c and d ( @xmath2  @xmath11 420 km  s@xmath0  and @xmath52950 km  s@xmath0 ) do not show any time variability , in spite of their small velocity distance from the quasar .",
    "they could still be intrinsic systems but a more stringent test will have to await future observations * two systems ( system  e and f ; @xmath2  = 60,400 and 52,800 km",
    "s@xmath0 ) show suggestive evidence of an intrinsic origin based on only covering factor analysis . to confirm this",
    ", we would need other evidence for intrinsic nals , such as time variability .    in order to investigate the nature of system  c further",
    ", there are at least two possible future observations .",
    "if we observe this quasar repeatedly at the appropriate time intervals ( e.g. , once a year ) , we may detect time variability in system  c. this observation would have the additional benefit that we could detect the formation of a bal in system  a as we have speculated . since the equivalent width of system  a has doubled in only @xmath11 1.3 years , a few more observations may show dramatic evolution .",
    "we could also diagnose variations in the ionization state of the absorber by comparing observed spectra with our simulations .",
    "spectropolarimetric observations would also be worthwhile because the degree of polarization in the troughs of intrinsic nals could be much larger than those in intervening nals , indicating scattering around the absorber .",
    "we believe that hs1603 + 3820 , one of the best laboratories for the investigation of intrinsic nals , is an excellent target to monitor over a long period of time .",
    "this work was supported by nasa grant nag5 - 10817 .",
    "we are grateful to the staff of the subaru telescope , which is operated by the national astronomical observatory of japan .",
    "we would also like to thank christopher churchill for providing us with the minfit software package , and ben lackey for his software to evaluate the pixel - by - pixel covering factors .",
    "finally , we wish to thank the anonymous referee for many helpful comments and suggestions .",

    "<S> we perform time variability analysis as well as covering factor analysis to separate intrinsic nals from intervening nals for 8 c  ivsystems . only system  a , which was identified as an intrinsic system in the earlier paper by misawa et al . , shows a strong variation in line strength ( @xmath3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that a broad absorption line ( bal ) could be forming in this quasar ( i.e. , many narrower lines will blend together to make a bal profile ) . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate the plausibility of this suggestion with the help of a simulation in which we vary the column densities and covering factors of the nal complex . under the assumption that a change of ionization state causes the variability , </S>",
    "<S> a lower limit can be placed on the electron density ( @xmath4 ) and an upper limit on the distance from the continuum source ( @xmath5  kpc ) . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> if the motion of clumpy gas causes the variability ( a more likely scenario ) , the crossing velocity and the distance from the continuum source are estimated to be @xmath6  km  s@xmath0  and @xmath7  pc . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the absorber does not intercept any flux from the broad emission line region , but only flux from the uv continuum source . if we adopt the dynamical model of murray et al . </S>",
    "<S> , we can obtain a much more strict constraint on the distance of the gas parcel from the continuum source , @xmath8 pc . </S>"
