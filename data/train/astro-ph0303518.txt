    "the investigation of color superconductivity in quark matter @xcite which was revived by applying nonperturbative qcd motivated interactions @xcite finds most of its justification in the possible importance for the physics of compact star interiors @xcite and related observable phenomena like neutron star cooling @xcite , gamma - ray bursts @xcite , gravitational wave signals for compact stars mergers @xcite and others @xcite .",
    "since calculations of quark pairing predict values of the energy gap @xmath0 mev and corresponding critical temperatures for the phase transition to the superconducting state are expected to follow the bcs relation @xmath1 for spherical wave pairing , quark matter in compact stars should always be in one of the superconducting phases .",
    "the question arises whether conditions in compact stars allow the occurence of quark matter and the formation of stable configurations of hybrid stars . in order to give an answer to this question one",
    "has to rely on models for the equation of state which necessarily introduce free parameters and therefore some arbitrariness in the results @xcite . in particular , the question whether color superconductivity shall be realized in the 2-flavor superconductivity ( 2sc ) or color flavor locking ( cfl ) phase in the compact star interior has been discussed controversely @xcite .",
    "we will restrict our further discussion to dynamical models of the njl type with their parameters adjusted by fitting hadron properties in the vacuum before extrapolating to finite temperatures and densities within the matsubara formalism .    within those models",
    "it has been shown that strange quark matter occurs only at densities well above the deconfinement transition , for chemical potentials which are barely reached in the very center of a compact star @xcite .",
    "the interesting and much investigated cfl phase could thus play only a marginal role for the physics of compact stars .",
    "the stability of the so obtained hybrid star configurations , however , appears to depend sensitively on details of the model , including the hadronic phase .    in the present paper we are investigating this dependence in a systematic way by employing a nonlocal chiral quark model which allows to vary the formfactor of the interaction kernel while describing the same set of hadronic vacuum properties .",
    "we provide a polynomial fit formula of our quark matter equation of state ( eos ) which proves useful for applications to compact star phenomenology , as e.g. the cooling @xcite and rotational evolution @xcite or the merging @xcite of neutron stars . in order to compare the results of the present work for hybrid star configurations with observational constraints , we pick the example of the compact object rx j@xmath2 , for which limits for both the mass and the radius",
    "have been reported @xcite .",
    "a further restriction in the mass - radius plane of possible stable configurations comes from the constraint given by the surface redshift measurement of exo 0748 - 676 @xcite .",
    "we consider the grand canonical thermodynamic potential for 2sc quark matter within a nonlocal chiral quark model @xcite where in the mean field approximation the mass gap @xmath4 and the diquark gap @xmath5 appear as order parameters and a decomposition into color ( @xmath6 ) and flavor ( @xmath7 ) degrees of freedom can be made .",

    "the nonlocality of the interaction between the quarks in both channels @xmath24 and @xmath25 is implemented via the same formfactor functions @xmath26 in the momentum space . in our calculations",
    "we use the gaussian ( g ) , lorentzian ( l ) and cutoff ( njl ) type formfactors defined as @xmath27^{-1},\\\\ \\label{nf } g_{\\rm njl}(q ) & = & \\theta(1 - q/\\lambda_{\\rm njl})~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the parameter sets ( quark mass @xmath28 , coupling constant @xmath29 , interaction range @xmath30 ) for the above formfactor models ( see tab . [ par ] ) are fixed by the pion mass @xmath31 mev , pion decay constant @xmath32 mev and the constituent quark mass @xmath33 mev at @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the diquark coupling constant @xmath35 is a free parameter of the approach which we vary as @xmath36 .    following ref .",
    "@xcite we introduce the quark chemical potential for the color @xmath12 , @xmath37 and the chemical potential of the isospin asymmetry , @xmath38 , defined as    @xmath39    where the latter is color independent .",
    "the diquark condensation in the 2sc phase induces a color asymmetry which is proportional to the chemical potential @xmath40 .",

    "@xmath49    where latter are assumed to be a massless , ideal fermi gas @xmath50    at the present stage , we do include only contributions of the first family of leptons in the thermodynamic potential .",

    "the stellar matter in equilibrium has to obey the constraints of @xmath3-equilibrium ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) , expressed as @xmath55 color and electric charge neutrality and baryon number conservation .",
    "we use in the following the electric charge density @xmath56 the baryon number density @xmath57 and the color number density @xmath58 the number densities @xmath59 occuring on the right hand sides of the above eqs .",

    "according to heuristic expectations , the effect of this diquark condensation ( formation of quark cooper pairs ) on the eos is similar to the occurrence of bound states and corresponds to a negative pressure contribution ( fig . [ fig : bagnew ] ) .    for phenomenological applications of the quark matter",
    "eos ( [ press ] ) we provide a polynomial fit of the bag pressure @xmath90    the coefficients @xmath91 as well as the critical chemical potential @xmath92 of the chiral phase transition depend on the choice of the formfactor ( see tabs .",
