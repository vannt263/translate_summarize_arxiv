    "the quantity of immediate interest to us is the quasi - static change of the conductance in response to @xmath131 .",
    "as explained in the main text , to detect this change we consider a periodic signal with slowly modulated amplitude , @xmath132 there are several contributions to the low - frequency response of the conductance to the modulation ( [ eq : modulation ] ) . to study them we first estimate the response of the resonator to the modulation assuming that the resonator dynamics is linear , @xmath133 .",

    "<S> the observed decrease of @xmath51 with the increasing resonant driving in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4c and d indicates that the cubic nonlinear ( duffing ) force has no substantial effect on the dynamics of the resonator . </S>",

    "<S> , we get that @xmath76m@xmath48s@xmath49 , which is close to the value estimated above . this result underscores that symmetry breaking is connected to the response of the resonance frequency to @xmath17 . </S>",

    "<S> this suggests that the bending is a consequence of the mechanical tension built in during the fabrication process . in the future </S>",
    "<S> , it will be interesting to measure @xmath3 as a function of @xmath17 for other nanotube resonators </S>",
    "<S> .    in the presence of thermal vibrations , symmetry breaking leads to spectral broadening  @xcite . because the amplitude of thermal vibrations fluctuates in time , the nonlinearity - induced shift in @xmath51 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4d ) also fluctuates and , therefore , broadens the mechanical resonance . </S>",
    "<S> the broadening in @xmath51 reads @xmath77 when the cubic restoring force is negligible compared to the quadratic one ( supplemental section x ) . using @xmath78m@xmath48s@xmath49 </S>",

    "<S> this corresponds to an apparent quality factor of 67 , which is comparable to the value of @xmath80 measured with the fm technique . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that this broadening is analogous to dephasing of two - level systems and qubits , which sets the characteristic time @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> the measured broadening is not related to dissipation , so that the energy relaxation time could be much longer than @xmath82 ( in fact , it is in this case that eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : frequency_spread1 ] ) gives the spectral broadening ) . for eigenmodes with a small @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> , the broadening can be due to the cubic restoring force  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> mechanical resonances might be further broadened by the coupling between eigenmodes  @xcite , as shown by recent simulations of nanotube resonators  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we assumed in our analysis of @xmath25 that the response of the amplitude of the vibrational motion is linear with the driving force . </S>",
    "<S> when the response becomes nonlinear at large driving forces due to the restoring force nonlinearity , the ratio of @xmath25 at @xmath21 and @xmath29 is expected to deviate from 4 . </S>",
    "<S> calculations show that the width of the peak in @xmath25 remains nearly constant upon varying the driving force , in contrast to the measurements in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4c . </S>",
    "<S> a general theory that incorporates nonlinearities in both the restoring force and damping  @xcite as well as thermal vibrations is beyond the scope of this letter . </S>",
    "<S> we note that our new technique to measure the motion of the equilibrium position allows to study the response of the resonator over a broad parameter range in driving force .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate that symmetry breaking leads to a motion at nearly zero - frequency in response to resonant excitation of the vibrations . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that symmetry breaking of vibrational modes also leads to such important dynamical properties as the apparent low quality factor of nanotube resonators at 300  k , and the shift of the vibration frequency in response to both ( i ) the static gate voltage and ( ii ) the amplitude of the oscillating driving force . a future strategy to improve the apparent @xmath0 at 300  k is to tune @xmath3 with the gate voltage in order to compensate the spectral broadening due to symmetry breaking with that due to the duffing nonlinearity . </S>",
    "<S> symmetry breaking is important for other vibrational systems of current interest , such as graphene resonators  @xcite and levitating particles  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our new technique may help to reveal this effect in such systems . </S>",
    "<S> symmetry breaking also leads to mode mixing and to parametric resonance in response to additive driving . </S>",
    "<S> this holds promise for a number of applications , such as controlled mode mixing  @xcite and phase noise cancelation  @xcite .    </S>",
