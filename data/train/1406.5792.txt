    "adiabatic acoustic equations appeared as a convenient tool for solving three - dimensional problems of ocean acoustics since the work of collins  @xcite and in refined version since the work of trofimov  @xcite .",
    "further this method was extended to interactive modes  @xcite .",
    "needless to say , that all this goes back to burridge and weinberg  @xcite .",
    "approach to interacting modes was known outside the parabolic equation scope  @xcite .    here",
    "the method of adiabatic mode parabolic equation is extended to the case of resonantly interacting modes , more concretely the considered interaction arises when the wavenumbers of modes are close to each other .",
    "the most intensive interaction of such a type is observed when the mode of discrete spectrum transforms into the mode of continuous spectrum , during the propagation , or vice versa .",
    "such transmutations of modes are common for shallow - water acoustics .",
    "we derive a system of mode parabolic equations which describes this situation .",
    "it can be easily solved numerically by the crank - nicholson implicit difference scheme in combination with the gauss - seidel iteration method .",
    "the application of the corresponding computer code to the asa wedge benchmark problem gives the excellent results .",
    "an additional advantage of our method is that the systematic use of multiscale expansions gives to the applied approach strictness and completeness .",
    "we consider the propagation of time - harmonic sound in the three - dimensional waveguide @xmath0 ( @xmath1-axis is directed upward ) , described by the acoustic helmholtz equation @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the density , @xmath5 is the wavenumber .",
    "we assume the appropriate radiation conditions at infinity in @xmath6 plane , the pressure - release boundary condition at @xmath7 @xmath8 and rigid boundary condition @xmath9 at @xmath10 . at @xmath11",
    "we impose the dirichlet boundary condition @xmath12 modelling the sound source located outside @xmath13 .",
    "the parameters of medium may be discontinuous at the nonintersecting smooth interfaces @xmath14 , where the usual interface conditions@xmath15 are imposed .",
    "hereafter we use the denotations @xmath16 and @xmath17 .    as will be seen below ,",
    "it is sufficient to consider the case @xmath18 , so we set @xmath18 and denote @xmath19 by @xmath20 .    assuming that @xmath21-axis is the preferred direction of propagation",
    ", we introduce a small parameter @xmath22 ( the ratio of the typical wavelength to the typical size of medium inhomogeneities ) , the slow variables @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( the so called `` parabolic scaling '' ) and postulate the following expansions for the parameters @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath20 : @xmath27 to model the attenuation effects we admit @xmath28 to be complex .",
    "namely , we take @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the attenuation in decibels per wavelength .",
    "this implies that @xmath32 .",
    "at first we consider a solution to the helmholtz equation ( [ helm ] ) in the form of the wkb - ansatz @xmath33 introducing this anzatz into equation ( [ helm ] ) , boundary condition ( [ dir ] ) and interface conditions ( [ interfcond ] ) , all rewritten in the slow variables , we obtain the sequence of the boundary value problems at each order of @xmath22 .    from the equations at @xmath34 and @xmath35",
