    "over the past few years , lyman alpha emitters ( laes ) have rapidly been gaining popularity as probes of cosmic reionization for two primary reasons .",
    "firstly , specific signatures like the strength , width of the ly@xmath0 line ( 1216  ) and the continuum break bluewards of it make the detection of laes unambiguous .",
    "secondly , since ly@xmath0 photons are highly sensitive to the presence of neutral hydrogen , their attenuation can be used to put constraints on the ionization state of the igm .    since these are also amongst the earliest galaxies to have formed , they represent superb probes of the properties and evolution of early galaxy populations .",
    "this is important since mechanical , chemical and radiative feedback from these galaxies will determine the properties of galaxies formed later on .",
    "obtaining the star formation rates ( sfr ) , metallicity , initial mass function ( imf ) of these galaxies are hence imperative in understanding galaxy evolution .",
    "advances in instrument sensitivity have enabled observers to push the observable frontier to increasingly high redshifts .",
    "there are now hundreds of confirmed laes at @xmath27 ( nilsson et al .",
    "2008 ) , @xmath28 ( cowie & hu 1998 ; steidel et al .",
    "2000 ; matsuda et al . 2005 ; venemans et al . 2007 ; ouchi et al . 2008 ) , @xmath29 ( finkelstein et al . 2007 ) , @xmath30 ( malhotra et al . 2005 ; shimasaku et al . 2006 ) and @xmath31 ( taniguchi et al . 2005 ; kashikawa et al . 2006 ) .    while the data accumulated on laes shows no evolution in the apparent ly@xmath0 luminosity function ( lf ) between @xmath32 - @xmath33 ( ouchi et al .",
    "2008 ) , the lf changes appreciably between @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( kashikawa et al .",
    "2006 ) with @xmath36 at @xmath37 being about 50% of the value at @xmath34 .",
    "surprisingly , however , the uv lf does not show any evolution between these same redshifts .",
    "kashikawa et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , have proposed this evolution in the ly@xmath0 lf to be indicative of a sudden change in the ionization state of the universe .",
    "however , the problem of why reionization would affect the high luminosity end of the lf rather than the the low , faint end , as expected , remains .",
    "a range of theoretical models , both semi - analytic ( dijkstra et al .",
    "2007a , b ; kobayashi et al . 2007,2009 ; dayal , ferrara & gallerani 2008 [ dfg08 ] ) and those involving cosmological simulations ( mcquinn et al . 2007 ; nagamine et al .",
    "2008 ) have been built to explain the observations and use laes as probes of reionization . using a search in a parameter space comprised by the sfr efficiency and ly@xmath0 transmission , dijkstra et al .",
    "( 2007b ) , showed that the evolution in the lf between @xmath34 and @xmath35 could be explained solely by an evolution of the underlying mass function .",
    "kobayashi et al . ( 2007 , 2009 ) , used a semi - analytic galaxy formation model , including the effects of dust and outflows on the escape fraction of ly@xmath0 photons to explain the same .",
    "nagamine et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , instead , have used the duty cycle scenario ( the fraction of laes turned on at a certain time ) to explain the uv lf at @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "mcquinn et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , have shown that reionization increases the measured clustering of laes and hence , these objects are very useful to probe the epoch of reionization .",
    "in dfg08 we showed that the ly@xmath0 and uv lfs can be explained by an evolution of the underlying dark matter halo mass function and dust attenuation that increases with decreasing redshift .",
    "we found that the erm ( early reionization model ) , in which reionization ends at @xmath40 , explains the data more consistently as compared to the lrm ( late reionization model , reionization ends at @xmath41 ) .",
    "we thus found that reionization does not play any role in shaping the ly@xmath0 lf at @xmath42 .",
    "this is consistent with the results obtained by mcquinn et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , who find that the universe must be highly ionized at @xmath43 .",
    "in addition to the lfs , our model also reproduced the weighted skewness measurements ( kashikawa et al . 2006 ) , the equivalent width ( ew ) at @xmath44 ( dawson et al .",
    "2007 ) and predicted the sfr density of laes . however , both the average and distribution of ews from our model at @xmath34 were much lower than those observed by shimasaku et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .    in spite of these different approaches ,",
    "there are still a number of missing ingredients , the most important of these being the calculation of the intrinsic ly@xmath0 luminosity , uv luminosity and sed ( spectral energy distribution ) as a function of the sfr , age , metallicity and imf of the galaxy under consideration .",
    "other important effects include the boost in the ionization rate imparted by galaxy clustering , its effects on the visibility of galaxies of different masses and the effects of inflows / outflows on the ly@xmath0 luminosity . up to now",
    ", only a general value of this boost has been used ( dijkstra et al .",
    "2007a ) ; however , the effects of clustering on the visibility of laes as a function of galaxy properties have largely remained unexplored .    in this paper , we use state - of - the - art cosmological sph simulations to fix the sfr , age , metallicity for each galaxy to obtain the intrinsic ly@xmath0 luminosity , uv luminosity and the sed .",
    "we again use the erm ( gallerani et al .",
    "2007 ) , which accounts for all available data beyond laes , including ly@xmath0/ly@xmath45 gunn - peterson opacity , electron scattering optical depths , lyman limit systems , cosmic sfr histories and the number density of high redshift sources . using the above ingredients , we obtain the ly@xmath0 and uv lfs and we are able to quantify the importance / effect of clustering on ly@xmath0 luminosity transmission and its contribution to shaping the ly@xmath0 lf",
    "by doing so , we gain insight on the nature of laes and put constraints on their elusive physical properties .",
    "the simulation analyzed in this paper has been carried out using the treepm - sph code ( springel 2005 ) , with the implementation of chemodynamics as described by tornatore et al .",
    "it is part of a larger set of cosmological runs , which are presented and discussed in detail elsewhere ( tornatore et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) .",
    "the adopted cosmological model corresponds to the @xmath46cdm universe with @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 km s@xmath50 mpc@xmath50 and @xmath51 , thus consistent with the 5-year analysis of the wmap data ( komatsu et al .",
    "the periodic simulation box has a comoving size of @xmath52 and contains @xmath53 dark matter particles and initially , an equal number of gas particles . as such , the masses of the dm and gas particles are @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "the plummer  equivalent softening length for the gravitational force is set to @xmath56kpc , kept fixed in physical units from @xmath57 to @xmath58 , while being @xmath59kpc in comoving units at higher redshift .",
    "the value of the softening parameter of the sph kernel for the computation of hydrodynamic forces is allowed to drop at most to half of the the gravitational softening .",
    "the run assumes a metallicity - dependent radiative cooling ( sutherland & dopita 1993 ) and a uniform redshift - dependent ultra violet background ( uvb ) produced by quasars and galaxies as given by haardt & madau ( 1996 ) .",
    "the code also includes an effective model to describe star formation from a multi - phase interstellar medium ( ism ) and a prescription for galactic winds triggered by supernova ( sn ) explosions ( see springel & hernquist 2003 for a detailed description ) .",
    "galactic winds are assumed to have a fixed velocity of 500 km s@xmath50 , with a mass upload rate equal to twice the local star formation rate .",
    "the code includes the description of chemical enrichment given in tornatore et al .",
    "metals are produced by snii , snia and intermediate and low - mass stars in the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "we assume snii arise from stars having mass above @xmath60 . as for snia ,",
    "we assume their progenitors to be binary systems , whose total mass lies in the range ( 316)@xmath61 .",
    "the relative number of stars of different mass is computed for this simulation by assuming the salpeter ( 1955 ) imf between 1 and 100 @xmath62 .",
    "metals and energy are released by stars of different masses by properly accounting for mass  dependent lifetimes . in this work",
    "we assume the lifetime function proposed by padovani & matteucci ( 1993 ) .",
    "we adopt the metallicity  dependent stellar yields from woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) and the yields for agb and snia from van den hoek & groenewegen ( 1997 ) .    as for the identification of galaxies ,",
    "they are recognized as gravitationally bound groups of star particles . for each analyzed snapshot",
    "we first run a standard friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm with a linking length of 0.2 in units of the mean particle separation .",
    "each fof group is then decomposed into a set of disjoint substructures , which are identified by the subfind algorithm ( springel et al .",
    "2001 ) as locally overdense regions in the density field of the background main halo . after performing a gravitational unbinding procedure , only sub - halos with at least 20 bound particles",
    "are considered to be genuine structures ( see saro et al .",
    "2006 , for further details ) .",
    "for each `` bona - fide '' galaxy , we compute the mass - weighted age , the total halo / stellar / gas mass , the sfr , the mass weighted gas / stellar metallicity , the mass - weighted gas temperature and the half mass radius of the dark matter halo .",
    "we compute the ly@xmath0 emission and spectral properties for all the structures identified as galaxies in the simulation boxes at the redshifts of interest ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "obviously , not all these galaxies will be necessarily classified as laes .",
    "we summarize here the main features of our model , the details of which can be found in dfg08 .",
    "star formation in galaxies gives rise to continuum and ionizing photons , of which the the latter ionize the inter stellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "due to the high density of the ism , recombinations take place on a short timescale and this gives rise to a ly@xmath0 emission line .    the intrinsic uv continuum and ly@xmath0 luminosity depend on the galaxy properties including the imf , sfr ( @xmath23 ) , stellar metallicity ( @xmath22 ) and age ( @xmath21 ) ; all these quantities are taken from the simulation outputs , as discussed above .",
    "starburst99 , ( leitherer et al . 1999 ) , a population synthesis code , is used to obtain the intrinsic values of the continuum luminosity as well as the rate of ionizing photons produced using the salpeter imf , appropriate sfr , age and metallicity for each simulated galaxy . from our model , for a galaxy with @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , the rate of production of ionizing photons , @xmath67 and the corresponding intrinsic ly@xmath0 luminosity is @xmath68 .",
    "this is very consistent with the value of @xmath69 shown in tab . 4 of schaerer ( 2003 ) for similar values of the age , metallicity and imf .",
    "for the same galaxy , the intrinsic continuum luminosity is @xmath70 , which yields an ew of about @xmath71  .",
    "the ly@xmath0 line profile is affected by the rotation velocity of the galaxy ( @xmath72 ) , unlike the continuum . for quiescent star formation , for realistic halo and disc properties",
    ", the galaxy rotation velocity can have values between 1 - 2 times the halo rotation velocity ( mo , mao & white 1998 ; cole et al .",
    "we use a value of @xmath73 in this work .",
    "we calculate the velocity of the halo , @xmath74 , assuming that the collapsed region has an overdensity of roughly 200 times the mean cosmic density contained in a radius @xmath75 .",

    "two processes determine the ly@xmath0 luminosity which emerges from the galaxy .",
    "first , only a fraction of the ionizing photons ionize the ism , contributing to the ly@xmath0 luminosity while the rest ( @xmath80 ) escape the galaxy and ionize the inter galactic medium ( igm ) surrounding it .",
    "second , only a fraction , @xmath81 , of the ly@xmath0 photons produced escape the galaxy , unabsorbed by dust in the ism .",
    "the doppler broadened ly@xmath0 luminosity profile that emerges from the galaxy is expressed as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the ionizing photon production rate for the intrinsic galaxy properties , @xmath84 is planck s constant , @xmath85 is the frequency of ly@xmath0 photons , @xmath86 \\nu_\\alpha$ ] , @xmath87 is the speed of light and the factor two - thirds arises assuming case b recombination ( osterbrock 1989 ) .",

    "the continuum luminosity emerging from the galaxy is expressed as @xmath88    ly@xmath0 photons suffer further attenuation as they travel through the igm due to their large optical depth ; even small amounts of neutral hydrogen in the igm can attenuate the ly@xmath0 luminosity by large amounts . to calculate this attenuation , we use the prescription detailed in sec 2.4 of dfg08 .",
    "we use the value of the uvb photoionization rate ( @xmath89 ) from gallerani et al .",

    "while empirical estimates from normal local and high redshift galaxies have yielded modest values of a few percent , theoretical studies have been largely inconclusive .",
    "recently , using an n - body@xmath99 hydrodynamic simulation , gnedin et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , have found an average value , @xmath100 , for halo masses between @xmath101 over redshifts between 3 and 5 .",
    "we use this value as a reasonable best estimate of @xmath80 for all the galaxies in the simulation boxes at @xmath102 to calculate the size of their strmgren sphere .",
    "we could also calculate @xmath80 by coupling our simulation with one that deals with radiative transfer .",
    "however , such a detailed analysis is deferred to future works .    inside the strmgren sphere",
    ", the ionization rate has two contributions : ( a ) a constant value , @xmath89 , determined by the uvb photoionization rate and ( b ) a radius dependent value , @xmath103 , determined by the luminosity that emerges out from the galaxy .",
    "the total photoionization rate ( @xmath104 ) at any distance @xmath105 from the galaxy can be expressed as @xmath106 where @xmath107 $ ] , is the specific ionizing luminosity emerging from the emitter , @xmath108 is the frequency corresponding to the lyman limit wavelength ( 912  ) and @xmath109 is the hydrogen photoionization cross - section .",
    "since the igm is in local photoionization equilibrium , we use ionization - recombination balance to compute the value of @xmath94 at each point within the strmgren sphere . at the edge of this region",

    "2000 ; bolton & haehnelt 2007 ) . in more dense regions",
    "the lorentzian damping wing of the voigt profile becomes important . according to peebles ( 1993 ) ,",
    "this can be approximated as @xmath132 where @xmath133  s@xmath50 is the decay constant for the ly@xmath0 resonance . although computationally more expensive than the above approximations , using the voigt profile to compute the absorption cross - section gives precise results , and therefore we have implemented it in our code to obtain all the results presented below .",
    "the observed ly@xmath0 luminosity ( @xmath134 ) can be expressed as @xmath135 where a fraction @xmath136 of the ly@xmath0 luminosity emerging from the galaxy is transmitted through the igm .",
    "since the continuum is unaffected by transmission through the igm , the observed continuum luminosity is calculated to be @xmath137",
    "one of the most important drawbacks of modelling laes semi - analytically is that only an average value of the uvb photoionization rate , @xmath89 , is usually assumed , making any inference on the additional contribution , @xmath138 , due to galaxy clustering not possible . as mcquinn et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , have shown , the observed clustering of laes is increased by transmission through a patchy igm as expected during reionization .",
    "in addition to being an important tool to probe reionization , clustering will also leave imprints on the ly@xmath0 lf .",
    "thanks to our cosmological sph simulations , we are able to include the effect of clustering on the ly@xmath0 lf and transmission .",
    "clustering of galaxies implies that the mean separation could become smaller than the typical size of their ionized regions .",
    "therefore , more than one galaxy affects the size of the region and the neutral hydrogen profile within it , thereby increasing the visibility of individual galaxies .",
    "consider for example the case of a luminous galaxy , a , and a fainter one , b ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . each one of them will carve an region in the igm , whose size depends on their luminosity , as shown in the figure . depending on the igm hydrogen neutral fraction , none , one or both galaxies can be seen individually .",
    "this is because , to a first approximation , the spatial scale imposed by the gunn - peterson damping wing on the size of the region corresponds to a redshift separation of @xmath139 , i.e. about 200 kpc ( physical ) at @xmath140 ( miralda - escud 1998 ) .",
    "however , when the mean separation between galaxies is smaller than the size of the smallest region ( i.e. galaxies are considerably clustered ) then it can occur that both galaxies can be observed as laes due to the increased region size and decreased fraction within it boosting the transmissivity .",
    "the importance of such clustering effect on lae visibility is stronger in the initial reionization phases , when the gas is almost neutral , implying that only clustered galaxies would be visible under those circumstances .    to quantify this effect from simulations",
    ", we use a post - processing technique in which we start by calculating the size of the ionized region around each galaxy as explained in eq .",
    "( [ vstrom ] ) .",
    "any two galaxies that are separated by a distance smaller than either of their strmgren radii are then treated as a local enhancement of the photoionization rate for the other , i.e. , for galaxy a , we add an extra contribution , @xmath138 , evaluated as the local value of the photoionization rate of galaxy b at the position of galaxy a. the same procedure is followed when considering the transmissivity of galaxy b. more generally , the total ionization rate , @xmath141 , seen at the position of galaxy @xmath142 , whose separation from @xmath143 other galaxies is smaller than either of the strmgren radii can be expressed as @xmath144 where the second term on the right hand side represents @xmath138 .",
    "further , @xmath145 is the ionizing luminosity emerging from the @xmath146 galaxy and @xmath147 is the radial distance between galaxies @xmath148 and @xmath142 . as a caveat , we point out that we are calculating clustering effects assuming that the sizes of the regions correspond to sources embedded in the igm at the mean ionization fraction given by the erm .",
    "however , prior to complete overlap , the ionization field is very patchy and galaxies are more likely to be immersed in either an almost neutral or a highly ionized region . because the average @xmath149 , it means that @xmath150% of the volume is substantially ionized at @xmath151 .",
    "hence , in general , our method provides a lower limit to the number of detectable laes .",
    "several authors ( zahn et al . 2007 ;",
    "mesinger & furlanetto 2007 ; geil & wyithe 2008 ) have presented schemes that avoid detailed radiative transfer ( rt ) calculations and still provide ionization schemes in good agreement with simulations . a precise calculation of clustering effects",
    "can also be done by properly following radiative transfer in detail .",
    "we defer these inclusions to our model to further work .",
    "to summarize , the boost in the ionization background imparted by clustering is important for all galaxies when the igm is close to neutral .",
    "the importance of this effect decreases as reionization proceeds , however , it decreases faster for more luminous galaxies .",
    "we are now ready to compare model results with observations . in particular",
    ", we compare the calculated uv and ly@xmath0 lfs to the data obtained by shimasaku et al .",

    "( 2006 ) ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "we also predict the lfs for @xmath152 although data are not yet available at this redshift .",
    "in addition , we also explore the effects of clustering on ly@xmath0 transmission and present synthetic spectral energy distribution ( seds ) to match with lai et al .",
    "( 2007 ) observations at @xmath30 . finally , we will discuss the physical properties such as age , metallicity , halo / stellar mass and sfr for all objects identified as laes from this work .      as mentioned before",
    ", we use the procedure explained in sec .",
    "[ phy_of_lya ] to calculate the observed ly@xmath0 luminosity for each of the galaxies in the simulation boxes .",
    "galaxies with ( a ) observed ly@xmath0 luminosity in the currently observable range , @xmath153 and ( b ) value of the observed ew , @xmath154  are then identified as laes , which are used to build the cumulative ly@xmath0 lf to compare to observations .",
    "the number of objects identified as laes from our simulations are ( 1696 , 929 , 136 ) at @xmath155 ; since the definition of lae is an operational one based on the observed ly@xmath0 luminosity , the number depends on the adopted values of @xmath81 and @xmath156 .",

    "[ lya3 ] .",
    "we find that , independent of clustering , to match the data at both @xmath30 and @xmath35 , only a certain fraction ( @xmath157 ) of the ly@xmath0 luminosity _ must emerge out of the galaxy , unabsorbed by dust within the ism_. as shown in the uppermost panel of fig .",

    "laes are characterized by dark matter halo masses in the range @xmath158 at @xmath159 , corresponding to @xmath160 fluctuations at all redshifts .",
    "this range becomes progressively narrower at earlier epochs because of two occurrences : ( i ) the mass function of halos shifts to lower masses in hierarchical structure formation models ; and ( ii ) smaller halos progressively become invisible at higher redshifts as their stellar mass and hence luminosity is too low to be detected ( we recall that all the objects analyzed are part of the lfs shown in figs .",
    "[ lya3 ] and [ uvlf3 ] ) . in spite of this fact",
    ", there is almost no evidence of evolution of the stellar to halo relation in the redshift range under examination , and we find @xmath161 , with the best fit given by the following expression : @xmath162 where @xmath163 .",
    "the above relation implies that the stellar mass per unit halo mass is increasing towards larger systems , which is just a restatement of the well - known fact that the star formation is less efficient in small galaxies due to the inhibiting effects of mechanical feedback .",
    "the typical stellar masses of laes are @xmath164 at all redshifts , i.e. they are smaller than the milky way .    although a considerable spread is present , on average larger systems tend to be older than small ones .",
    "laes result from the merging of several sub - halo systems in which star formation was ignited long before . in tab .",
    "[ table2 ] , we show that the range of ages reduces towards high redshifts from @xmath165 myr at @xmath20 to @xmath166 myr at @xmath18 .",
    "these ages imply that the oldest stars in these systems formed already at @xmath167 , thus during the reionization epoch .",
    "we reiterate that , because of finite numerical resolution , stars in halos below our resolution limit might have formed even before that epoch , so the previous value must be seen as a lower limit to the onset of star formation activity . from the previous discussion it is clear that laes are neither pristine nor very young objects forming their stars for the first time .",
    "this is confirmed by the range of metallicities found in these systems and shown in fig .",
    "[ phy1 ] ( see also tab . [ table2 ] ) .",
    "metallicities are in the range @xmath168 @xmath169 , with the mean over the sample decreasing with redshift ; also , larger objects have higher metallicities as expected from their larger stellar masses .",
    "these results are broadly consistent with an enrichment predominantly caused by snii , and therefore tightly following the sfr of the galaxy ; the increasing scatter seen at the lowest redshift hints at a larger contribution by snia .",
    "the mass - metallicity relation for laes is also an interesting outcome of our study .",
    "this can be conveniently expressed as @xmath170 where @xmath163 . differently",
    "to the analogous relation observed at lower redshifts ( tremonti et al . 2004 ; panter et al . 2008 ; maiolino et al .",
    "2008 ) , we do not see the sign of a flattening of metallicity towards larger masses . as the flattening",
    "is usually interpreted as a result of a transition from a galactic wind - regulated metal budget to a close - box evolution in which all metals are retained , we conclude that in our laes , winds play an important role because of their relatively low masses , a point already noticed above .",
    "we now turn to the analysis of the star formation properties of laes ( fig .",

    "star formation rates are in the range from 2.5 - 120 @xmath171 , i.e. a sustained but not exceptionally large star formation activity , with large objects at later times being the most prominent star factories .",
    "the relation appears to flatten below @xmath172 , as is clearly seen .",
    "stated differently , low mass laes have star formation rates confined in the narrow range 2.5 - 10 @xmath171 , whereas only ( relatively few ) larger objects undergo intense star formation events , @xmath173 .",
    "this might be the result of feedback regulation , which prevents small objects from burning most of their gas fuel at high rates . to investigate this aspect more ,",
    "we have studied the behavior of a star formation indicator , @xmath174 .",
    "physically , this is the ratio between the stellar mass produced if a lae had always formed stars at the rate deduced at the given redshift for a time equal to the mean age of its stars , and the actual total stellar mass of the system .",
    "hence if @xmath175 ( @xmath176 ) , the star formation rate was lower ( higher ) in the past .",
    "the large majority of laes show values of @xmath176 , indicating that the star formation rate averaged over the entire history must be larger than the final value .",
    "this could be due to huge bursts of star formation , catalyzed by mergers .",
    "some systems ( at the low and high ends of the stellar mass distribution at @xmath20 ) have @xmath175 , i.e , they have quietly built up their stellar population at an increasing rate as they grow in mass by subsequent mergings .",
    "we provide a handy fit for the sfr in terms of the stellar mass : @xmath177 ^ 2 -   \\\\ & & ( 6.9 - 0.8\\delta z ) \\log_{10 } ( m _ * ) + ( 30 - 5\\delta z),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath163 .",
    "finally , we discuss the dependence of the observed ly@xmath0 luminosity on age and sfr ( fig .",
    "[ contour ] ) .",
    "the sfr for all galaxies with a given @xmath134 are very similar , even though the ages vary between @xmath178 myr .",
    "as explained before , this is because according to the erm , at @xmath20 , the universe is already so ionized ( @xmath179 ) that even the smallest emitters are able to build large enough strmgren spheres on short timescales .",
    "further , the number of galaxies with small sfr ( @xmath180 ) is quite high , after which this number decreases rapidly ( see also fig . [ sfr ] ) , with very few galaxies in the highest luminosity bins .",
    "thus , the faint end of the lf samples a mixture of young and old objects , while laes in the bright end are predominantly massive , intermediate ( 200 - 250 myr ) age systems .",
    "the ages of lae stellar populations are currently hotly debated , hence we need to discuss our results in the framework of the various arguments given in the literature .",
    "for example , finkelstein et al . (",
    "2009 ) find a bimodality in their sample of 14 laes at @xmath181 ; their objects are either very young ( @xmath182 myr ) or very old ( @xmath183 myr ) . their results could be explained by invoking two different star formation modes in laes : a recent strong burst or a continuous sf in which the bulk of the population is dominated by old objects . to better evaluate this possibility , we plot the normalized distribution of the mass - weighted stellar ages for all the laes identified in the simulation volume at @xmath184 and @xmath185 in fig .",
    "we do not find any such bimodality from our simulation .",
    "laes are distributed in age between 39 - 165 myr at @xmath186 and this range increases with decreasing redshift , as already mentioned above .",
    "a possible explanation of the experimental result could be the presence of dust .",
    "laes would be visible in the ly@xmath0 when the age @xmath182 myr so that not enough dust would have formed and at later times @xmath187 myr when the galaxy would have destroyed/ removed most of its dust content . in the intermediate periods",
    ", the ly@xmath0 line would be attenuated below observable limits . however , a complete picture is possible only if dust creation / destruction is modelled accurately , which we leave for future work .",
    "another interesting point is the ly@xmath0 line equivalent width .",
    "we calculate the rest frame observed ews at @xmath20 using our estimates of @xmath5 and @xmath4 from the uv and ly@xmath0 lfs as mentioned in tab .",
    "[ table1 ] as @xmath188 where @xmath189 . for our sample",
    "we find that @xmath190ew / @xmath191 , with mean value of 63.5 .",
    "this is about a factor of 2 lower than the mean value of @xmath192  , observed by shimasaku et al .",
    "this discrepancy is probably due to physical effects that are not included in our model and which could broaden the ew distribution and increase its mean value .",
    "these include : ( i ) ly@xmath0 emission from cooling of collisionally excited in the ism ( dijkstra 2009 ) . adding this contribution to the ly@xmath0 luminosity from stars could increase the intrinsic ly@xmath0 luminosity from the galaxy by large amounts while leaving the intrinsic continuum luminosity value unchanged , thereby increasing the intrinsic ew ; ( ii ) we are using the same escape fractions of ly@xmath0 and continuum photons for all the galaxies . in reality , however , these values would change on a galaxy to galaxy basis , depending on the amount , topology and distribution of dust inside the galaxy , contributing to a broadening of the ew distribution ; ( iii ) outflows could increase the observed ew distribution since they would enable more of the ly@xmath0 luminosity to escape undamped by dust , while leaving the continuum unchanged .",
    "further , outflows with a sufficiently high value of the column density ( @xmath193 ) add a bump to the red part of the ly@xmath0 line , thereby increasing the observed ew ( verhamme et al .",
    "2006 ) ; ( iv ) inflows would lead to a further damping of the ly@xmath0 luminosity and lead to a decrease in the ew .",
    "a full exploration of these effects requires modelling the amounts and distribution of dust and peculiar gas motions in individual galaxies .",
    "we defer this to future works at this point .    at @xmath20",
    ", we find that for all galaxies with an observed ly@xmath0 luminosity , @xmath153 , the observed ew is greater than 20 .",
    "this means that all lbgs having a ly@xmath0 luminosity larger than this value show an observed ly@xmath0 ew @xmath194  from our work .",
    "although their samples are very small ( 6 and 8 galaxies respectively ) , stanway et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and dow - hygelund et al .",
    "( 2007 ) find that only about 30% of lbgs showing a ly@xmath0 emission line have an observed ly@xmath0 ew larger then 20  .",
    "the main reason for this tension could be the fact that we are using the same ratio of @xmath195 for all the galaxies at @xmath20 ; however , this value should change on a galaxy to galaxy basis .",
    "the relative escape fractions of ly@xmath0 and continuum photons must depend on the amount and distribution of dust and inside the galaxy .",
    "modelling this effect more realistically would probably lead to many galaxies having @xmath196  and resolve this tension .",
    "laes are among the most distant galaxies known .",
    "as the quest for reionization sources is struggling to identify the most important populations for this process , it is worthwhile to assess to what extent laes might represent such a long - searched - for population .",
    "first we note that ( tab .",
    "[ table2 ] ) at @xmath20 , the sfr density provided by laes is @xmath197 , and this decreases with increasing redshift . comparing this to the cosmic sfr density of @xmath198 at the same redshift measured by hopkins ( 2004 )",
    ", we find that laes contribute only about 9.2% to the cosmic sfr value , confirming the previous result of dfg08 .",
    "corresponding to this sfr evolution and @xmath199 , it is easy to derive that the ionizing photon rate density ( @xmath200 ) contributed by laes is @xmath201 at @xmath37 .",
    "we compare this photon rate density to the one necessary to balance recombinations given by madau , haardt and rees ( 1999 ) :    @xmath202    where @xmath203 is the igm clumping factor . for @xmath204 , corresponding to a homogeneous igm , we get the minimum ionizing photon rate density necessary to balance recombinations , i.e. @xmath205 .",
    "this means that the laes on the ly@xmath0 lf at @xmath206 can contribute at most 25% of the ionizing photons needed to balance recombinations at this redshift .",
    "this value decreases to 0.8% as @xmath203 increases to 30 .",
    "the total ionizing photon rate density contributed by all astrophysical sources ( @xmath207 ) at @xmath43 can be calculated as ( bolton & haehnelt , 2007 ) @xmath208 using @xmath209 ( tab . [ table1 ] ) , gives @xmath210 at @xmath43 .",
    "this implies laes contribute about 12.5% of the total ionizing photon rate , which is consistent with the sfr density contribution of laes to the global value . such a low contribution from lae , given",
    "their halo and stellar masses does not come as a surprise .",
    "indeed , this result is consistent with the previous estimates by choudhury & ferrara ( 2007 ) who showed that only a fraction @xmath211% of the photons required to ionize the igm come from objects in the lae range , the bulk being provided at high redshifts by faint ( or even ultra faint , see salvadori & ferrara 2009 ) dwarf galaxies .",
    "we use a large scale hydrodynamical simulation to derive the physical properties ( halo , stellar , gas mass , star formation rate , stellar age and metallicity ) of high redshift galaxies . using a reionization history consistent with an early reionization epoch ( erm ) , we fix the evolution of the background photoionization rate , and calculate the size of the strmgren sphere around each object , taking into account the ionization boost due to spatial clustering of the sources when computing the corresponding ly@xmath0 radiation transmission .",
    "we then define as laes galaxies with an observed ly@xmath0 luminosity above the currently observable limit ( @xmath153 ) and an observed ew @xmath212  .",
    "we find that ly@xmath0 photons at both @xmath20 and @xmath35 must be attenuated by dust within the galaxy to reproduce the observed lae luminosity function .",
    "the amount of photons that escape the ism , undamped by dust is @xmath4 at both redshifts . at @xmath43",
    "the simulated lf lies between the upper and lower limits of the data . at face value",
    ", this results implies that further spectroscopy of lae candidates at this redshift should rule out @xmath213% of them as laes .",
    "clustering of sources boosts the average value of the total photoionization rate ( and consequently the ionized hydrogen fraction ) in the surroundings of galaxies by @xmath214 times at @xmath215 ; this value increases by more than a factor of 50 at @xmath18 . for an almost neutral igm ( @xmath216 ) , if clustering effects are ignored , only those few galaxies that are able to carve out a large enough region are visible .",
    "however , about 4 times more galaxies become visible when clustering effects are included . in a highly ionized igm ( @xmath217 , @xmath218 ) , however , the effect of clustering is indiscernible on the ly@xmath0 lf .",
    "note that , the clustering boost is not necessarily the highest for the most massive galaxies .",
    "our model is probably somewhat overstating the effects of clustering because we are not treating the radiation transfer of ionizing radiation .",
    "the fraction of ly@xmath0 luminosity transmitted always increases with sfr and about @xmath219% of the ly@xmath0 luminosity is transmitted at @xmath220 ; however , this relation shows a larger scatter at @xmath151 ( transmission between 20 - 50 % ) compared to the lower redshifts since at @xmath18 , it is essentially the photoionization rate boost due to clustering which enables ly@xmath0 luminosity transmission , if galaxies are embedded in the neutral patches of the igm .",
    "the presence of dust even at these high redshift is further confirmed by the analysis of the lae uv luminosity function , which we have also reproduced within our study . matching the uv lf",
    "requires that the escape fraction of uv continuum photons is @xmath221 at @xmath222 , again a clear signature of dust attenuation .",
    "we interpret the higher attenuation of the continuum photons relative to the ly@xmath0 ( neufeld 1991 ) at @xmath20 as hinting at an inhomogeneous two - phase ism with dust clumps embedded in a warm intercloud gas while the relative attenuation is consistent with homogeneously distributed dust at @xmath43 . at @xmath20 ,",
    "the color excess calculated from our model , @xmath223 , is consistent with the value deduced by lai et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , @xmath224 , and the results obtained by nagamine et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ( @xmath223 ) using sph simulations .",
    "the color excess , @xmath225 , at @xmath43 is lower than the value at @xmath3 ; this is expected due to to the average lower metallicities of laes towards higher redshifts ( see tab .",
    "3 ) . by extrapolating these results at @xmath151 , we have predicted the uv and ly@xmath0 lfs for laes at @xmath18 .    as a further test of our results",
    ", we have selected three laes from our simulation whose observed ly@xmath0 luminosities match most closely with the values observed at @xmath20 by lai et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . for each of the chosen objects , the intrinsic spectra ( obtained using starburst99 ) is attenuated using a sn dust extinction curve and @xmath6 to match to the observations .",
    "we find our synthetic spectral energy distributions are in very good agreement with the observations .",
    "the objects observed are found to have ages of a few hundred myr , metallicity about @xmath226% @xmath169 and sfr of 7 - 10 @xmath227 .",
    "all three laes are well fit by a single value of the color excess , hinting at the fact they all might be dust enriched to a similar degree .",
    "finally , we have discussed in detail the physical properties ( and we provide handy fitting functions to several relations among them ) of galaxies which we identify as laes at @xmath228 and @xmath185 .",
    "the ages of the laes range between @xmath166 myr at @xmath18 but this range increases to @xmath165 myr at @xmath3 .",
    "further , the average metallicity of laes is @xmath229 at @xmath186 , and increases to @xmath230 at @xmath3 .",
    "hence , laes are more metal - enriched than what usually assumed .",
    "star formation is relatively suppressed by feedback in low mass halos ( @xmath231 ) and it rises steeply for the larger halo masses . the large majority of laes seem to have had a higher average star formation rate over the entire history as compared to the final value .",
    "further study would be necessary to put this statement on more solid grounds .",
