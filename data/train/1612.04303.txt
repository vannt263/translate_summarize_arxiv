    "since the discovery of iron - based superconductivity in 2008 @xcite , several families of superconducting ferropnictides were synthesized @xcite .",
    "all iron pnictides possess a layered crystal structure comprising quasi - two - dimensional fe - as blocks separated by spacers along the @xmath9-direction .",
    "superconductivity develops namely in fe - as layers whose structure remains nearly the same for all the iron pnictides , whereas the difference is in the spacer blocks structure @xcite . for the so called 1111-family , the whole structure consists of a stack of superconducting fe - as blocks and nonsuperconducting @xmath10-o spacers ( @xmath10 is a rare - earth metal ) .",
    "1111-oxypnictides possess the simplest band structure as compared to other pnictides @xcite .",
    "band - structure calculations showed that iron @xmath11 orbitals make the main contribution to the normal - state density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level , forming electron and hole sheets of the fermi surface .",
    "the hole sheets represent two concentric cylinders near the @xmath12 point of the first brillouin zone , whereas the electron sheets are formed by two cylinders of elliptic cross section near the m points .",
    "both electron and hole cylinders are slightly warped along the @xmath9-direction . as was demonstrated in angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes )",
    "studies @xcite , these fermi surface sheets are considered to be formed by two effective ( hole and electron ) bands .",
    "the arpes studies @xcite also revealed a feature typical of optimally doped sm-1111 : singular fermi surface sheets near the @xmath12 and m points . under electron doping , superconducting critical temperatures of smofeas varies in the wide range up to @xmath13k @xcite .",
    "therefore , sm-1111 is an ideal candidate for investigating the role of electron doping on the superconducting properties .    to describe multiband superconductivity in iron pnictides ,",
    "the two basic models were suggested : @xmath14-model of coupling through orbital fluctuations enhanced by phonons @xcite , and @xmath15-model of spin - fluctuation - mediated superconductivity @xcite . to date , both models have not got yet unambiguous experimental evidence .",
    "some theoretical studies predict a certain influence of impurity scattering on the gap values in iron - based superconductors @xcite .",
    "therefore , direct @xmath16 data are of the most importance to answer the key question concerning the underlying pairing mechanism .",
    "the experimentally determined gap values in sm-1111 as well as in other oxypnictides in whole are rather contradictory @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath17 in sm-1111 determined by point - contact ( pcar ) spectroscopy varies by a factor of six , from nearly weak - coupling bcs - limit 3.6 3.7 in @xcite up to 22 in @xcite .",
    "this fact raises the problem of accurate superconducting order parameter determination by various experimental probes .",
    "thorium substitution in sm@xmath0th@xmath1ofeas oxypnictide supplies charge carriers to superconducting fe - as layers giving rise to superconductivity .",
    "it opens an unique possibility to explore the evolution of the superconducting order parameter versus critical temperature in the same compound with no direct influence to the geometry of fe - as tetrahedrons @xcite . to the best of our knowledge , here we present the first data on the evolution of the superconducting gap , @xmath18 , and the characteristic ratio , @xmath19 , for 1111-oxypnictides with heterovalent substitution in wide range of @xmath3 .",
    "the paper contains a systematic study of current - voltage characteristics ( cvc ) and dynamic conductance spectra for sns - andreev contacts in optimal and underdoped sm@xmath0th@xmath1ofeas samples with various thorium doping . here",
    "we present the data in the range @xmath20k and nominal th concentrations @xmath21 , and the pioneer data with @xmath22k sample series ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "using intrinsic multiple andreev reflections effect ( imare ) spectroscopy , we directly determined the bulk values of two superconducting gaps @xmath24 and @xmath25 , their temperature dependences , and bcs - ratios .",
    "we found a scaling between both gaps and critical temperature , and nearly constant bcs - ratios within all studied @xmath3 range .",
    "we find that the gap temperature dependences @xmath7 are well described by the two - band moskalenko and suhl system of equations @xcite with a renormalized bcs - integral ( rbcs ) . from this fitting",
    ", we have determined the intraband and interband coupling parameters and prove that the intraband coupling is stronger than the interband coupling in sm - based oxypnictides .",
    "polycrystalline sm@xmath0th@xmath1ofeas samples with various thorium doping and critical temperatures ( @xmath26k ) were synthesized by high - pressure method .",
    "overall details of the sample cell assembly and high - pressure synthesis process may be found in refs .",
    "powders of smas , thas , fe@xmath27o@xmath28 , and f of high purity ( @xmath29 ) were weighed according to the stoichiometric ratio , thoroughly ground , and pressed into pellets .",
    "then , the pellet containing precursor was enclosed in a boron nitride crucible and placed inside a pyrophyllite cube with a graphite heater .",
    "all the preparatory steps were done in a glove box under argon atmosphere .",
    "the six tungsten carbide anvils generated pressure on the whole assembly . in a typical run ,",
    "the sample was compressed to 3gpa at room temperature .",
    "while keeping the pressure constant , the temperature was ramped up within 1h to the maximum value of 1430@xmath30c , maintained for 4.5h , and finally quenched to the room temperature .",
    "afterward , the pressure was released and the sample removed .",
    "subsequently recorded x - ray powder diffraction patterns revealed high homogeneity of the samples and the presence of a single superconducting phase @xcite .",
    "the amount of additional nonsuperconducting phases smas and tho@xmath27 was vanishingly small .",
    "the bulk character of superconductivity in sm@xmath0th@xmath1ofeas samples was confirmed by magnetization measurements .      in our experiments",
    ", we used a break - junction technique @xcite to produce symmetrical sns contacts .",
    "the sample prepared as a thin rectangular plate with dimensions about @xmath31mm@xmath32 was attached to a springy sample holder by four - contact pads made of pasty ( at room temperature ) in - ga alloy .",
    "after cooling down to @xmath33k , the sample holder was gently curved , which caused cracking of the bulk sample .",
    "the microcrack generates cryogenic clefts and separate the bulk sample into two parts with a weak link between them , thus forming scs contact ( where @xmath9 is a constriction ) .",
    "cleavage of a layered sample causes its exfoliation along the @xmath34-planes and an appearance of steps and terraces at cryogenic clefts ( fig .",
    "this is typically the case for both single crystals and polycrystalline samples @xcite .",
    "as an illustration , we considered in ref .",
    "@xcite a model polycrystalline sample with randomly oriented @xmath34-planes of grains , where intergrain connection is just 10 % stronger than the interlayer one ( along the @xmath9 direction for any of grains ) . in this case",
    "we expect quite a considerable amount of split crystallites in the ab - plane @xmath35 . in a more realistic situation ,",
    "when the strength of intergrain connection exceeds the interlayer ultimate strength by @xmath36 , about @xmath37 of grains would split , causing the appearance of large amount of steps and terraces .",
    "these estimates are supported by the electron microscope image of polycrystalline sample cleft shown in fig .",
    "1b .      under fine tuning of the sample holder curvature , the two cryogenic clefts slide apart touching through various terraces .",
    "this enables to vary the cross - size of the resulting scs contact in order to realize a ballistic regime . in the majority of fe - based superconductors we studied ,",
    "the constriction is electrically equivalent to a thin layer of normal metal , and the resulting current - voltage characteristic ( cvc ) and @xmath38 are typical for clean classical sns - andreev junction with high transparency of about @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "such contacts exhibit a multiple andreev reflections effect which manifests itself as a pronounced excess current at low bias voltages ( so called foot ) in cvc , and a subharmonic gap structure ( sgs ) in the @xmath38 spectrum . at temperatures below @xmath3",
    "sns - contact demonstrates an excess conductance at any bias , whereas the sgs represents a series of dynamic conductance minima at certain positions :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is a natural subharmonic order . in principle , the first andreev minimum could be slightly shifted towards lower biases , @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "if so , the gap value may be determined from positions of the higher order sgs dips with @xmath43 . in case of a two - gap superconductor",
    ", two subharmonic gap structures should be expected .",
    "the number of observed sgs dips strongly depends on the ratio between the carrier mean free path @xmath44 and the contact size @xmath45 : @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the break - junction experiments with layered samples , beside the single sns contacts , also show arrays of sns contacts @xcite . in this case , the cvc and @xmath38 demonstrate andreev minima at positions which are integer multiplies @xmath47 of those for the single sns junction :    @xmath48    this obviously corresponds to a stack of @xmath47 sequentially connected identical sns junctions .",
    "the numbers @xmath47 can be easily determined by comparing @xmath38 curves for various arrays : after scaling the bias voltage axis by @xmath47 , the positions of sgs dips in dynamic conductance spectra should coincide .",
    "the andreev dips in cvc and @xmath38 for such arrays are more pronounced than those for single sns junction ; the larger @xmath47 , the sharper peculiarities are usually observed @xcite .",
    "this firm experimental fact indicates that the origin of such arrays with high - quality characteristics could not be thought about as a chain of independent nonequivalent grain - grain contacts @xcite .",
    "by contrast , probing the andreev arrays ensures one to minimize surface defects influence and measure namely _ bulk properties _ of the sample @xcite . the intrinsic multiple andreev reflections effect ( imare ) occurring in such arrays",
    "is similar to the intrinsic josephson effect in sis contacts ( where @xmath49 is an insulator ) @xcite ; both effects were observed first in cuprates @xcite .",

    "the imare spectroscopy realized by the break - junction technique has a number of advantages :    \\a ) the microcrack generates terraces of about atomic size .",
    "they remain tightly connected during sliding that prevents impurity penetration into the microcrack and protects the purity of cryogenic clefts ;    \\b ) the contact point is far from current and potential leads , which prevents junction overheating and provides true four - point connection ;    \\c ) by fine bending of the sample holder , one can probe several tens of andreev arrays with various diameter and number of junctions in the stack @xmath47 in one and the same sample and during the same cooldown ; it enables to collect statistics and to check the data reproducibility ;    \\d ) unlike asymmetric ns and nis junctions @xcite , in sns - andreev contacts the gap value may be determined directly ( from the positions of sgs dips ) , and no fitting of @xmath38 is needed ; the latter remains true at any temperatures @xmath50 @xcite , therefore , one can obtain precise temperature dependences of the gaps ;    \\e ) by probing the andreev arrays one unambiguously determines bulk values of superconducting gaps .",
    "the dynamic conductance spectra were measured directly by a standard modulation technique @xcite .",
    "we used a current source with ac frequency less than 1khz .",
    "the results obtained with this setup are insensitive to the presence of parallel ohmic conduction paths ; if any path is present , dynamic conductance curves shift along the vertical axis only , while the bias stay unchanged .",

    "2 ) based on the mare model @xcite extended for the case of @xmath59 gap anisotropy fits the experimental data ( circles ) very well .",
    "the model @xcite , beside @xmath60 ratio , accounts finite temperatures and possible presence of an andreev band within the gap .",
    "the latter causes the complex fine structure in the fit ( satellite dips beyond the subharmonics ) unobservable in the experiment ; this issue requires a special study .",
    "a slight deviation from the expected position ( formula ( 1 ) ) of andreev dips ( @xmath61 uncertainty ) is rather conventional . for details ,",
