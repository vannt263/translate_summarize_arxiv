    "let @xmath0 be a real - valued sample continuous gaussian random field .",
    "given a level @xmath1 , the excursion set of @xmath2 above the level @xmath1 is the random set @xmath3 understanding the structure of the excursion sets of random fields is a mathematical problem with many applications , and it has generated significant interest , with several recent books on the subject ( e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) and with considerable emphasis on the topology of these sets .",
    "one very natural question in this setting which has until now eluded solution but which we study in this paper is the following : given that two points in @xmath4 belong to the excursion set , what is the probability that they belong to the same path - connected component of the excursion set ?",
    "specifically , let @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "recall that a path in @xmath4 connecting @xmath7 and @xmath8 is a continuous map @xmath9\\to{{\\mathbb{r}}}^d$ ] with @xmath10 , @xmath11 .",
    "we denote the collection of all such paths by @xmath12 and are interested in the conditional probability @xmath13 it is straightforward to check that we are considering measurable collections of outcomes , so this probability is well defined .",
    "of course , the conditional probability above is a ratio of two probabilities , the denominator being no more than a bivariate gaussian probability , which is well understood .",
    "therefore , we will concentrate on the unconditional probability @xmath14 if the random field is stationary , we may , without loss of generality , assume that @xmath15 , in which case we will use the simpler notation @xmath16 in ( [ epathprob ] ) .",
    "when the domain of a random field is restricted to a ( compact ) subset @xmath17 , the points @xmath7 and @xmath8 will be assumed to be in @xmath18 , and the entire path in ( [ epathprob ] ) will be required to lie in @xmath18 as well ( the implicit assumption being that @xmath18 contains _ some _ path between @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) .",
    "nevertheless , we will use the same notation and also write @xmath19 which of the two interpretations of @xmath20 is intended at any point will be clear from the context .",
    "we will study the logarithmic behavior of the probability @xmath21 for high levels  @xmath1 , that is , as @xmath22 .",
    "we start with a large deviations approach , which , as usual , will not only describe the probability but also give us insight into the highest probability configurations .",
    "this makes up sections [ secld ] and [ secsmallenergy ] , which follow a brief technical section [ secbackground ] collecting some results on the reproducing kernel hilbert space of a gaussian process . throughout",
    "we will treat the general and the stationary cases in parallel , but separately , since the stationary case is somewhat more transparent and more readily provides illustrative and illuminating special cases .",
    "in particular , we will look at a number of one - dimensional examples in sections  [ seconedim][longsec ] , where we can compute quite a lot . even in this case",
    "the results are new and rather unexpected .",
    "we look at the multidimensional case in section [ secmultcase ] .",
    "while this section also contains some interesting and surprising examples , it turns out that typical examples involve nonconvex optimization problems that we do not , at this stage , know how to solve in general .",
    "in this section we introduce much of the notation we will use in the rest of the paper and recall certain important notions , concentrating in particular on the reproducing kernel hilbert ( rkhs ) space of a gaussian process .    our main reference for the rkhs is van der vaart and van zanten @xcite , and we use it selectively so as to prepare the background for using the large deviations theory of deuschel and stroock @xcite .",
    "an alternative route would be to have followed the new notes by lifshits @xcite .",
    "we consider a real - valued centered continuous gaussian random field @xmath0 .",
    "when needed ( particularly , in the nonstationary case ) we may restrict the domain of the random field to a compact subset @xmath18 of @xmath4 .",
    "we denote the covariance function of @xmath2 by @xmath23 .",
    "as is customary , when the random field is stationary , we will use the single variable notation @xmath24 for the covariance function . in this case",
    "we denote the spectral measure of @xmath2 by @xmath25 , this being the symmetric , finite , borel probability measure on @xmath4 satisfying @xmath26    if @xmath2 is stationary , then this and local boundedness imply that @xmath27 with probability 1 , so that almost all the sample paths of @xmath2 belong to the space @xmath28 equipped with the norm @xmath29 @xmath30 becomes a separable banach space , with dual space @xmath31 we view the stationary random field @xmath2 as a gaussian random element of @xmath30 , generating a gaussian probability measure @xmath32 on that space .    in the absence of stationarity , we will usually consider a continuous gaussian random field @xmath33 , for a compact set @xmath17 . in that case",
    "we view the random field @xmath2 as a gaussian random element in the space @xmath34 of continuous functions on @xmath18 , equipped with the supremum norm , thus generating a gaussian probability measure @xmath32 on @xmath34 .    the reproducing kernel hilbert space ( henceforth rkhs )",

    "this is also the _ reproducing property _ of the rkhs .",
