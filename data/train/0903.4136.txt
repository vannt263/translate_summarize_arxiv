    "errors on the best fit parameters were determined with monte carlo simulations .",
    "we tested the robustness of the procedure through some simulations , and showed that the maximum mass and the maximum eddington ratio determined in each redshift bin depend neither on the quasar number density nor on the survey flux limit ( which is responsible of giving raise to a malmquist - type bias in the observed dependence on redshift of the mean quasar bh masses ) .",
    "we then studied the dependence on redshift of the maximum quasar bh mass and of the maximum eddington ratio and found clear evidence for evolution of the active bh population with redshift . over",
    "the redshift range studied , we obtained that the maximum mass of the quasar population depends on redshift as @xmath129 , while the maximum eddington ratio is found to be practically independent of redshift .",
    "this means that qso samples at lower redshift are increasingly dominated by lower mass bhs , i.e. the more massive a bh is , the earlier it starts quasar activity . within a scenario in which quasar host galaxies are already fully formed massive ellipticals at @xmath10 ,",
    "our results can be also interpreted as an evolution with redshift of the parameter @xmath121 , which would be 45 times larger at @xmath122 than today .",
    "we wish to thank yue shen for providing sdss quasar spectral measurements before publication .",
    "we are grateful to an anonymous referee for constructive criticism , which led to an improvement of the paper .",
