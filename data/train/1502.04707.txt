    "the last few years have seen a rapid increase in the discovery of brown dwarfs significantly cooler than any previously known objects in the solar neighborhood @xcite .",
    "@xcite presented the discovery of several brown dwarfs from _ wide - field infrared survey explorer _ ( _ wise _ ) data , and they distinguished these objects from warmer brown dwarfs primarily using spectral features in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands and proposed a new `` y '' spectral class for the sample . @xcite",
    "presented the first comprehensive sample of parallaxes for the y  dwarfs and derived bolometric luminosities showing that even objects with quite different near - infrared spectra ( and thus very different  estimates from model atmospheres ) in fact had indistinguishable temperatures of @xmath8400450k . assuming ages of 15gyr , typical for field brown dwarfs , evolutionary models predict masses of 620  for the y  dwarfs .",
    "thus , y  dwarfs could be free - floating planetary - mass ( @xmath913 ) objects , but this can only be tested directly with dynamical mass measurements from binaries .",
    "however , none of the binaries yet discovered at the t / y transition @xcite have short enough estimated periods ( @xmath920yr ) to enable orbit determinations in the near future .",
    "we present here the discovery of a tight ( @xmath11 ) binary at the y  dwarf boundary from our ongoing keck laser guide star adaptive optics ( lgs ao ) imaging survey .",
    "@xcite discovered the unresolved source wise  j014656.66 + 423410.0 , hereinafter wise  j0146 + 4234 , and assigned a spectral type of y0 based on keck / nirspec spectroscopy in @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands ( also see @xcite ) . using a new , higher signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) gemini / gnirs spectrum covering 0.92.4  we derive an integrated - light spectral type of t9p for wise  j0146 + 4234 . adopting the parallax distance of  from @xcite , the projected separation of wise  j0146",
    "+ 4234ab  is @xmath80.9au , which would make it tighter than any previously known l or t  dwarf visual binary at discovery .",
    "we first observed wise  j0146 + 4234  during a period of exceptionally good seeing on 2012  sep  7  ut with the facility near - infrared camera nirc2 with the lgs ao system at the keck  ii telescope @xcite . according to the differential image motion monitor ( dimm ) at the canada - france - hawaii telescope ,",
    "the seeing in the visible was @xmath12 on mauna kea during our observations .",
    "compared to all archived seeing measurements during 2012 , such favorable conditions occur @xmath135% of the time that the dimm is active . during our dither sequences we kept the lgs centered in nirc2 s narrow camera field of view .",
    "the wavefront sensor recorded an lgs flux equivalent to a @xmath1410.2  mag star and a lower bandwidth sensor monitored the star 2mass  j01465144 + 4234388 ( @xmath15mag , 65  away from the target ) in order to perform tip - tilt corrections .",
    "we later observed wise  j0146 + 4234  in the same setup on 2012  oct  8 and 2013  oct  22  ut , during times of unusually good seeing ( @xmath16@xmath17 and @xmath18@xmath19 , respectively ) .",
    "we reduced our lgs ao data in the same fashion as our previous work @xcite .",
    "reduced images from each data set are shown in figure  [ fig : keck ] .",
    "we measured binary parameters by fitting three - component gaussians to individual images and determined the uncertainties in these parameters from the rms scatter among each data set . to correct for non - linear distortions in nirc2 we used the calibration of @xcite ,",
    "from which we also adopt linear terms of @xmath20mas  for the pixel scale and @xmath21 for the detector s @xmath22-axis orientation relative to north .",
    "table  [ tbl : keck ] presents the binary separation , position angle ( p.a . ) , and flux ratio that we derived from each data set , along with the airmass and ao - corrected fwhm of our images .",
    "we note that the astrometry measured in different bandpasses at a given epoch agree well within the errors and have reasonable @xmath23 , supporting our adopted astrometric uncertainties .",
    "wise  j0146 + 4234  had no previously published photometry on the mauna kea observatories ( mko ) system , and the 2mass system photometry from @xcite has very large errors , so we obtained new mko photometry using the facility camera niri at the gemini - north telescope @xcite on 2013  jan  10 and 2013  jan  12  ut . all data were taken on photometric nights , with seeing typically around 0@xmath248 and ukirt fs  6 used for photometric calibration . our observations at @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 bands are summarized in table  [ tbl : gem ] .",
    "we note that our photometry is highly inconsistent with the values presented by @xcite , even after accounting for the conversion from 2mass to mko systems . @xmath27mag and @xmath28mag according to synthesized photometry from our gnirs spectrum ( section  [ sec : gnirs ] ) .",
    "our photometry is 1.6mag ( 6.0@xmath10 ) fainter at @xmath29 band and 2.5mag ( 9.3@xmath10 ) fainter at @xmath30 band .",
    "the cause of this discrepancy is not clear , but we note that @xcite reported similar cases for three y  dwarfs that they found were significantly fainter ( 0.51.0mag ) than published values from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we suspect large systematic errors in the photometry from @xcite for wise  j0146 + 4234  because colors based on those values were noted by to be extremely unusual ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 colors @xmath332mag redder than objects of similar spectral type ) , whereas our @xmath4 and @xmath5 magnitudes resolve this discrepancy .",
    "@xcite have also reported @xmath5-band photometry ( @xmath34mag ) that agrees with our higher precision gemini measurement .",
    "we therefore use our photometry in the following analysis .",
    "we obtained a full 0.92.4  spectrum of wise  j0146 + 4234  using the gnirs spectrograph @xcite because the published spectrum from @xcite had limited wavelength coverage and low s / n .",
    "we used the 32 lines  mm@xmath35 grating , @xmath36  camera , and @xmath37 slit to achieve a resolving power of @xmath38 over a total integration time of 8400s ( table  [ tbl : gem ] ) .",
    "we reduced our data in a similar fashion to our previous work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the flat fielded , sky subtracted , and rectified integrated - light spectrum of wise  j0146 + 4234ab  is shown in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "we flux calibrated the spectrum using our niri photometry at @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 bands ( table  [ tbl : gem ] ) . to account for modest discrepancies between our synthesized and measured @xmath2 colors , we added 0.2mag errors in quadrature to our synthesized photometry to achieve @xmath39 when computing the optimal scaling factor and its error .    from our calibrated spectrum we computed @xmath26-band photometry as check against our very low s / n niri photometry ( @xmath40mag ) .",
    "after accounting for the uncertainty in the calibration , we synthesized @xmath41mag .",
    "this is inconsistent with our niri photometry at 2.3@xmath10 .",
    "both our photometry and the @xmath26-band portion of our gnirs spectrum are very low s / n , and our synthesized photometry may be subject to systematic errors associated with extrapolating our flux calibration from @xmath2 to @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , in the following analysis we adopt an average value of @xmath42mag that is consistent at 1.3@xmath10 with both measured and synthesized photometry .",
    "from our resolved photometry alone , companionship is highly likely .",
    "the blue near - infrared colors of the companion wise  j0146 + 4234b  are very similar to wise  j0146 + 4234a , implying that it not likely to be a background giant .",
    "the difference in @xmath43 color of @xmath44mag between the two components implies that they have similar levels of methane absorption and therefore are both late - type t or y dwarfs . according to @xcite ,",
    "the probability of finding such an unassociated late - t dwarf in the entire @xmath45 field of view of nirc2 s narrow camera is @xmath46 , thus the likelihood that the two components of wise  j0146 + 4234ab  are not physically bound is negligible .",
    "moreover , the proper motion of @xmath47yr@xmath35 and parallax of @xmath48 measured by @xcite implies that an unassociated background star would move by @xmath49 between our first and last observations , which is strongly ruled out by our astrometry ( table  [ tbl : keck ] ) .      to determine the integrated - light spectral type of wise  j0146 + 4234ab  we directly compared our spectrum to standards from @xcite . for reference",
    ", we also computed commonly used spectral indices , which we report in table  [ tbl : indices ] . in determining spectral types we focus on the @xmath4- and @xmath5-band regions of the spectrum , leaving the somewhat unusual @xmath3-band region to our later discussion in section  [ sec : logg ] .",
    "the relative heights of the flux peaks in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands better match the t9 standard ugps  j072227.51@xmath50054031.2  and t9.5 dwarf wisepc  j014807.25@xmath50720258.7  than the y0 standard wisepa  j173835.53 + 273258.9  ( figure  [ fig : spectrum ] ) .",
    "the @xmath4-band region , normalized to its peak flux , best matches the t9 standard ugps  j0722@xmath500540because the y0 standard , and even the t9.5 dwarf wise  j0148@xmath507202 , have notably narrower flux peaks .",
    "this is reflected by the fact that @xmath4-band spectral indices w@xmath51 @xcite and @xmath4-narrow @xcite best match the t9 dwarfs from @xcite .",
    "however , the peak - normalized @xmath5-band region seems to be intermediate between t9 and y0 standards , best matching the t9.5 dwarf wise  j0148@xmath507202 . in terms of indices , this manifests as an nh@xmath52 index that best matches t9.5 dwarfs .",
    "we also note that the wavelength at the peak of the @xmath5-band flux is shifted slightly to the red by 0.006 , a feature that has only previously been observed in wisepc  j140518.40 + 553421.4 , which was typed as y0(pec ? ) by @xcite .",
    "no two of these three traits ( t9-like @xmath4 band , t9.5-like @xmath5 band , and shifted @xmath5-band peak ) have been observed in any other object , making the integrated - light spectrum of wise  j0146 + 4234ab  particularly unusual .",
    "the two methane indices ( defined by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are broadly consistent with a late - t or y spectral type .",
    "the ch@xmath53 index best matches t9.5 dwarfs but is also consistent with y0 dwarfs .",
    "the ch@xmath54 index is problematic because the numerator has almost no flux in it by the late - t dwarfs .",
    "thus , even though our spectrum has sufficient s / n to accurately measure this index , many comparison objects do not , so our value ends up being consistent within the rms of all t8.5y0 spectral type bins .",
    "overall , we find evidence for both t9 and t9.5 spectral types by visually comparing to spectral standards and examining spectral indices .",
    "most published work has focused on @xmath4 band in determining spectral types at the t / y transition , and our @xmath4 band spectrum leans more toward a type of t9 .",
    "therefore , we assign a type of t9p to the integrated - light spectrum of wise  j0146 + 4234ab . in this case , the peculiar designation refers to both the 0.006  shift in the @xmath5-band peak , as originally suggested by @xcite for wise  j1405 + 5534 , and the t9.5-like @xmath5-band spectrum .    to determine spectral types for the individual components of wise  j0146 + 4234ab , we performed spectral decomposition following the method outlined in section  5.2 of @xcite .",
    "briefly , we consider all possible pairs from a library of template spectra and find the optimal scale factors needed for a pair of templates to best match the observed integrated - light spectrum .",
    "we then compute synthetic relative photometry for these pairings and compute the @xmath23 of these values compared to the measured flux ratios from our keck lgs ao imaging .",
    "unlike in @xcite , here we have a much smaller library of template spectra given the number of objects later than t8 with high quality near - ir spectra .",
    "our library comprises four t8.5 dwarfs ( ulas  j003402.77@xmath50005206.7 , wisepc  j121756.91 + 162640.2a , ulas  j133553.45 + 113005.2 , and wolf  940b ) , two t9 dwarfs ( ugps  j0722@xmath500540  and cfbdsir  j145829 + 101343ab ) , one t9.5 dwarf ( wise  j0148@xmath507202 ) , five y0 dwarfs ( wisepa  j041022.71 + 150248.5 , wise  j1217 + 1626b , wise  j1405 + 5534 , wise  j1738 + 2732 , and wisepc  j205628.90 + 145953.3 ) , and one y0.5 + ( wisepa  j154151.66@xmath50225025.2 ) .",
    "spectra for these objects were published by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . another difference in our analysis compared",
    "to @xcite is the wavelength range tested .",
    "because many published spectra do not extend into @xmath3 or @xmath26 band , we use only the 1.151.85  region for our fitting .",
    "the best matching template pair , both in terms of fitting our integrated - light spectrum and flux ratios at @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath25 bands , is ugps  j0722@xmath500540  ( t9 ) and wise  j1405 + 5534  ( y0p ) .",
    "a primary spectral type of t9 is consistent with the fact that this brighter component should dominate the integrated - light spectrum given our keck flux ratios of @xmath81.0mag in @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands .",
    "it is not surprising that wise  j1405 + 5534  provides the best matching secondary component because of some of the features it shares with our integrated - light spectrum ( shifted @xmath5-band peak and large ch@xmath54 index ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : decomp ] shows this best - fit template pairing .",
    "a number of other template pairings give both a good fit to the spectrum and reasonable flux ratios .",
    "these either use ugps  j0722@xmath500540  ( t9 ) or a t8.5 ( ulas  j0034@xmath500052  or wise  j1217 + 1626a ) as the primary and a y0 ( wise  j1217 + 1626b , wise  j1738 + 2732 , or wise  j2056 + 1459 ) or the t9.5 wise  j0148@xmath507202  as the secondary .",
    "therefore , we assign component types corresponding to our best - fit template pair ( t9+y0 ) with uncertainties of @xmath550.5 subtypes in each . given some of the unusual features seen in integrated light , we note that one or both components may also be peculiar despite our not typing them as such .",
    "our new photometry and spectral analysis allow us to compare the colors of wise  j0146 + 4234ab  to other late - t and y  dwarfs ( figure  [ fig : cmd ] ) .",
    "the @xmath2 colors of both components and the integrated - light @xmath56 color are mostly typical of other t8.5y0 objects .",
    "the color in which the components appear most unusual is @xmath6 , where the y0 secondary s color is @xmath57mag .",
    "this would not be unusual for a late - t dwarf , but it is on the extreme red end of colors for y  dwarfs where only one comparably red object is known , the y0 dwarf wise  j073444.02@xmath50715744.0  ( @xmath58mag ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , both components of wise  j0146 + 4234ab  are distinctive in that they are the reddest known objects in @xmath6 at faint absolute magnitude ( @xmath59mag ) . their @xmath60 colors place them on the blue edge of the t / y sequence in color  magnitude diagrams , and their integrated - light @xmath56 color of @xmath61mag is normal for objects of comparable absolute magnitude but would be relatively blue for a late - t dwarf .    on mid - infrared color ",
    "magnitude diagrams , the integrated - light photometry of wise  j0146 + 4234ab  follows the sequence of late - t and y  dwarfs , but its location is unusual given the integrated - light spectral type of t9 .",
    "wise  j0146 + 4234ab s integrated - light color @xmath62-[4.5 ] = 2.42\\pm0.07$]mag is the reddest of any known t9 dwarf , with the next reddest objects being the t8.5+y0 binary wise  j1217 + 1626ab ( t9 in integrated - light with @xmath62-[4.5 ] = 2.33\\pm0.03$]mag ) followed by wise  j033515.01 + 431045.1  ( t9 ) and wisepa  j213456.73@xmath50713743.6  ( t9p ) both with @xmath62-[4.5 ] = 2.22\\pm0.04$]mag .",
    "the only late - t dwarf that is as red as wise  j0146 + 4234ab  is wise  j081117.81@xmath50805141.3 ( t9.5 : , @xmath62-[4.5 ] = 2.42\\pm0.07$]mag ) , but like other t9 and t9.5 dwarfs it is @xmath81.01.5mag brighter in @xmath62$]-band absolute magnitude than the combined light of wise  j0146 + 4234ab .",
    "the situation is similar but less extreme in @xmath63 color versus @xmath64-band absolute magnitude .",
    "wise  j0146 + 4234ab  is the reddest late - t dwarf ( @xmath65mag ) with the exceptions of wisepc  j232519.54@xmath50410534.9  ( t9p ; @xmath66mag ) and wise  j2134@xmath507137  ( t9p ; @xmath67mag ) .",
    "both of these were typed as peculiar by @xcite due to excess flux at @xmath3 band and less flux at @xmath26 band , similar to features seen in the integrated - light spectrum of wise  j0146 + 4234ab .",
    "however , unlike these t9p objects , the integrated - light @xmath64-band flux of wise  j0146 + 4234ab  is 0.70.8mag fainter , implying that the individual components are @xmath331mag fainter .",
    "both components of wise  j0146 + 4234ab  have very faint absolute magnitudes given their spectral types .",
    "wise  j0146 + 4234a  is the faintest t9 dwarf known in any near- or mid - infrared bandpass , and wise  j0146 + 4234b  is as faint or fainter than wise  j1405 + 5534  ( y0p ) in near - infrared magnitudes and could be the faintest in the mid - infrared , too , depending on the binary flux ratio at those wavelengths .",
    "wise  j0146 + 4234a  is the only late - t dwarf wholly overlapping in colors _ and _ magnitudes with the y  dwarfs .",
    "@xcite showed that summing fluxes across the near- and mid - infrared can produce an estimate for the bolometric magnitudes ( ) of late - t and y  dwarfs that is only weakly dependent on the assumed model atmospheres .",
    "we applied this `` super - magnitude '' approach to the integrated - light photometry of wise  j0146 + 4234ab  and found @xmath68mag . to apportion this between the two individual components we employed",
    "our resolved near - infrared photometry . for our purposes ,",
    "only the relative near - infrared super - magnitude between the two components is relevant , and we find @xmath69mag . to convert this into a bolometric flux ratio requires an estimate of the bolometric correction for each component .",
    "@xcite report bolometric corrections of bc@xmath70mag at t9 and @xmath71mag at y0 , and we adopt these values for the primary and secondary , respectively . thus , the bolometric flux ratio is calculated as @xmath72mag , and we find bolometric magnitudes of @xmath73mag and @xmath74mag for the primary and secondary , respectively .",
    "we compare our apparent bolometric magnitude estimates to the typical absolute magnitudes of late - t and y dwarfs in order to illustrate an unusual property of wise  j0146 + 4234ab . using the  values from table  s5 of @xcite",
    ", we find that @xmath75mag for t9 and @xmath76mag for y0 , where the error bars represent the intrinsic rms scatter in bolometric magnitude among objects of the same spectral type . assuming spectral types of t9+y0 for wise  j0146 + 4234ab , the integrated - light absolute bolometric magnitude would be @xmath77mag if they were typical of other known objects",
    ". however , this is 1.7mag different from the bolometric magnitude of @xmath78mag derived from the photometry above and the parallactic distance of  from @xcite . therefore wise  j0146",
    "+ 4234ab  is significantly less luminous than other known objects of the same spectral type , which at least partly explains its unusual appearance on color  magnitude diagrams as described above .",
    "we consider the alternative that the parallax of @xmath79mas from @xcite is in error .",
    "they used multiple telescopes ( _ wise _ , _ spitzer _ , and keck ) and bandpasses ( @xmath5 , @xmath62 $ ] , @xmath80 $ ] ) to measure the parallax , which introduces the possibility of systematic errors in the astrometry .",
    "this is especially true in the case of a t9+y0 binary where the flux ratio could vary considerably from the near- to mid - infrared causing unaccounted for shifts in center - of - light measurements at different epochs .",
    "however , for the components of wise  j0146 + 4234ab  to have normal magnitudes for a t9+y0 dwarf pair would require a distance of @xmath81pc , where the error bars account for the uncertainty in the  and scatter in  as a function of spectral type @xcite , and thus a parallax of @xmath840mas .",
    "this would require photocenter shifts of more than half the binary separation , and such shifts would have to be correlated with the parallax factor .",
    "figure  17 of @xcite shows that there is both keck and _ spitzer _  data on both sides of the ellipse , so a large error in the parallax due to mixing bandpasses seems unlikely .",
    "we also consider whether orbital motion could have impacted their parallax . because proper motion accommodates for any linear orbital motion ,",
    "only acceleration is a concern , and this usually shows up in the residuals of the fit .",
    "@xcite report @xmath82 ( 27 degrees of freedom ) , so there are no significant residuals due to orbital motion , but such acceleration could in principle be aligned with the parallax motion by chance . to test this possibility , we fitted just the @xcite astrometry spanning 2012  october to 2013  november , which is contemporaneous with our keck data that show only a small amount of orbital motion , @xmath83masyr@xmath35 .",
    "we find a relative parallax of @xmath84mas in this fit , which is consistent with their reported value .",
    "finally , we have determined a preliminary parallax of @xmath85mas from our own ongoing astrometry program at the canada - france - hawaii telescope @xcite , which further supports the unusually low luminosity of wise  j0146 + 4234ab .",
    "we used the cloud - free cond evolutionary models of to estimate the physical properties of the binary components from their luminosities and simple assumptions for the system age .",
    "we combine our bolometric magnitudes from above and the parallactic distance from @xcite to compute @xmath86dex for the primary and @xmath87dex for the secondary .",
    "we interpolate the cond model grid at ages of 1gyr and 10gyr to derive masses , temperatures , and other properties from these  values and present the results in table  [ tbl : prop ] .",
    "some properties that we derive from evolutionary models vary significantly with the assumed age , while others do not .",
    "for example , the primary component s mass and effective temperature are @xmath88  and @xmath89k at 1gyr but @xmath90  and",
    "@xmath91k at 10gyr .",
    "this is because models predict a radius contraction of only 17% from 1gyr to 10gyr , so for a given  the  estimate changes by a small amount . unlike the radius however , luminosity is a strong function of mass and age at field ages ( @xmath92 ; * ? ? ?",
    "consequently , a property like surface gravity that depends on mass changes significantly with the assumed age ( @xmath80.7dex ) while the effective temperature only changes by @xmath925k .",
    "there is an extensive literature on the impact of both surface gravity and metallicity variations on the emergent spectra of t dwarfs with @xmath931000k ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but similar studies are only beginning for @xmath9500k objects at the t / y transition .",
    "the latest model atmospheres from @xcite show how the shapes of normalized near - ir flux peaks change with varying surface gravity ( their figure  15 ) at the temperatures of y  dwarfs .",
    "models at @xmath94dex ( @xmath95 in cgs units ) have distinctive features compared to @xmath96dex at a common @xmath97k such as substantially increased flux on the blue side of the peak - normalized @xmath3 band , a broader @xmath4-band peak caused by increased flux on the red side , and a wavelength for the @xmath5-band flux peak slightly shifted to the red .",
    "note that the @xmath3-band excess is only a change in the shape of the peak and not its amplitude , as @xcite predict that @xmath6 actually becomes @xmath80.5mag redder due to the integrated flux at @xmath3 band being more suppressed than at @xmath4 band when going from @xmath98dex to 5.0dex .",
    "we observe all of these features in our integrated - light spectrum of wise  j0146 + 4234ab  ( figure  [ fig : spectrum ] ) . to our knowledge , this is the first object known to possess all of these traits . a number of objects",
    "have been reported to display enhanced flux on the blue side of @xmath3 band ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but of these only wise  j030449.03@xmath50270508.3  ( y0p ) has been reported to show the slightly increased flux on the red side of the @xmath4-band peak @xcite .",
    "wise  j1405 + 5534  ( y0p ) displays the shifted peak wavelength in @xmath5 band @xcite but has a normal @xmath4 band and no @xmath3-band data .",
    "unfortunately , non - solar metallicity models are not yet available at these temperatures , so it is not known if any of these traits could also be reproduced by a sub - solar metallicity , as is often the case for earlier type t dwarfs where the effects of low metallicity and high gravity can be similar ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we conclude therefore that wise  j0146 + 4234ab  is very likely to be relatively old , having higher surface gravity and/or lower metallicity compared to other known t / y transition objects .",
    "the chief caveat is that we only have an integrated - light spectrum that is likely dominated by the primary along with our resolved broadband photometry to characterize the photospheres of the individual components .",
    "our spectral decomposition analysis in section  [ sec : spt ] demonstrates that even a @xmath81mag fainter secondary can influence the best - fit template match , since in this case it was the y0p wise  j1405 + 5534 . among the next tier of best matching templates both components of wise  j1217 + 1626ab ( t8.5+y0 )",
    "were often favored , and these are also high surface gravity / low metallicity candidates @xcite .      the projected separation of wise  j0146 + 4234ab  at discovery was @xmath99 ( @xmath1au ) , and we can use table  6 of @xcite to convert this into a statistical estimate of the semimajor axis ( @xmath100 ) . the conversion factor for very - low mass visual binaries ( @xmath101 )",
    "gives a semimajor axis estimate of @xmath102 ( @xmath103au ) .",
    "however , because we discovered wise  j0146 + 4234ab  very near the resolution limit of our keck lgs ao images , we are likely in the `` moderate discovery bias '' case where the inner working angle of the discovery observations ( @xmath104 ) is roughly half the size of the semimajor axis and a different conversion factor applies .",
    "thus , our best estimate for the semimajor axis is @xmath105 ( @xmath106au ) .",
    "we note that wise  j0146 + 4234ab  likely has the smallest projected separation in au at discovery of any visual binary ever found among l , t , or y dwarfs .",
    "the next tightest is 2mass  j15344984@xmath502952274ab that was discovered at @xmath107au @xcite .",
    "we can further estimate the orbital period of wise  j0146 + 4234ab  via kepler s third law using the total system mass estimate we derived from evolutionary models .",
    "assuming an age of 10gyr gives @xmath108  and using the smaller of the semimajor axes above ( moderate discovery bias ) yields a period estimate of @xmath109yr .",
    "even if wise  j0146 + 4234ab  were much younger and thereby lower mass ( @xmath110  for an age of 1gyr ) , its estimated orbital period would still be quite short ( @xmath111yr ) .",
    "thus , regardless of the current uncertainties in the system mass and semimajor axis , wise  j0146 + 4234ab  appears to be an excellent candidate for dynamical mass determination via monitoring of the binary orbit over the next several years , as it typically requires only @xmath830% coverage of the orbital period to enable a direct measurement of the system mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , we already detect a small amount of orbital motion in our keck lgs ao imaging that spans 1.1yr ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "both components of wise  j0146 + 4234ab  appear to be less luminous than any other known members of substellar binaries , even the y  dwarf companions cfbdsir  j1458 + 1013b and wise  j1217 + 1626b @xcite .",
    "this in turn implies that many of the properties of wise  j0146 + 4234ab  are extreme relative to other known systems . to reach such low luminosities , both components of wise  j0146",
    "+ 4234ab  must be planetary mass ( @xmath913 ) and/or very old .",
    "we identify several spectrophotometric features that are indicative of high surface gravity , so it appears likely that the system is indeed old , although sub - solar metallicity models at @xmath113500k are needed to strengthen this conclusion .",
    "we estimate component masses that are quite small , with cond models giving 1321  for the primary ( 1@xmath10 range ) and 1219  for the secondary even if the system is 10gyr old . currently , a large source of uncertainty in the component properties is how the integrated - light bolometric flux should be divided between the two components .",
    "resolved mid - infrared photometry and near - infrared spectroscopy are needed to more precisely determine the physical properties of both components .",
    "the faintness of wise  j0146 + 4234a  is unexpected given its t9 spectral type .",
    "its absolute magnitudes are @xmath81.01.5mag fainter in the mid - infrared and @xmath82mag fainter in the near - infrared than is typical for its spectral type , even allowing for a @xmath550.5 subtype uncertainty in classification .",
    "the faint absolute magnitudes lead to a low bolometric flux estimate , and in turn a low temperature of @xmath7k for the primary ( assuming an age of 10gyr ) .",
    "this is @xmath8100k colder than any other known late - t dwarf.k for ugps  j0722@xmath500540  ( t9 ) , assuming an age of 1gyr @xcite .",
    "examining other objects with recently published parallaxes , we compute that only wise  j2325@xmath504105  ( t9p ) , wise  j2134@xmath507137  ( t9p ) , and wise  j0148@xmath507202  ( t9.5 ) have cooler  estimates , ranging from @xmath114k to @xmath115k , assuming ages of 1gyr and using parallaxes from @xcite and photometry from @xcite . ]",
    "according to the stefan - boltzmann law , at a given luminosity @xmath116 .",
    "thus , a @xmath820% discrepancy in  could be compensated by the radius being 40% smaller , i.e. , 0.55  instead of 0.91 .",
    "such a radius is unphysical as it is significantly smaller than any predicted or measured substellar radii ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "according to evolutionary models from @xcite , assuming an age older than 10gyr would have only a small effect ( @xmath91% ) on the radius , and assuming a 2@xmath117 larger mass would reduce the radius by only @xmath810% .",
    "however , these effects might partially explain the apparent temperature discrepancy between wise  j0146 + 4234a  and other t9/t9.5 dwarfs .",
    "a systematic error in the @xcite parallax distance could also mitigate this discrepancy , but to explain it entirely would require an unlikely error of a factor of @xmath332 in the measured parallax .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the discrepancy between wise  j0146 + 4234a s spectral type and its temperature can not be completely explained by systematic errors in the assumed radius or luminosity .",
    "one intriguing explanation for the @xmath8100k cooler  of wise  j0146 + 4234a  compared to other objects of similar spectral type is that the features in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 bands that are widely used to determine spectral types for late - t and y dwarfs are highly dependent on gravity or metallicity .",
    "since these flux peaks are shaped by molecular features ( e.g. , ch@xmath118 , h@xmath119o , h@xmath119 , and nh@xmath120 ) , a sensitivity to gravity or metallicity is not unexpected .",
    "this did not appear to be the case in the initial sample of late - t and y dwarfs with -based temperatures from @xcite where spectral types tended to track well with , with the possible exception of t9.5 dwarfs that seemed to be warmer or similar temperature compared to t9 dwarfs .",
    "however , as the sample of parallaxes for late - t and y dwarfs grows , a jumbling of objects with the same  but very different spectral types should become clearly apparent if the range of surface gravities and/or metallicities of the field population significantly affect near - infrared spectral types .    with only a few of the coldest known brown dwarfs showing signatures of high surface gravity",
    ", it seems that objects like the components of wise  j0146 + 4234ab  must either be relatively uncommon or observationally selected against .",
    "predict that high surface gravity objects at a given temperature are indeed @xmath80.20.3mag fainter in the @xmath64 band that was used to discover most known objects of this type .",
    "however , this would lead to lower gravities being over represented by only @xmath830%50% in a magnitude - limited sample .",
    "in fact , given the generic assumption of a declining star formation history in the solar neighborhood ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , older , higher gravity brown dwarfs should be much more common at a given  than lower gravity ones , unless the mass function compensates by having a strong preference for producing lower mass brown dwarfs . if higher gravity brown dwarfs are uncommon it would imply either an unusual age distribution for brown dwarfs in the solar neighborhood ( favoring younger ages ) or a large undiscovered population of planetary - mass brown dwarfs that are the older and colder but similar mass counterparts to the current y  dwarf sample .",
    "fortunately , wise  j0146 + 4234ab  will soon provide an opportunity to much better constrain its physical properties . with a projected separation of @xmath1au and estimated orbital period @xmath910yr , wise  j0146 + 4234ab  is not only a contender for the tightest known ultracool binary ,",
    "it is also the first binary discovery at the t / y transition that is likely to yield a dynamical mass quickly , as other discoveries have estimated orbital periods of @xmath12140400yr .",
    "the relative orbit of wise  j0146 + 4234ab  could be determined by astrometric monitoring within just a few years .",
    "a dynamical mass for wise  j0146 + 4234ab  will test the hypothesis that the components are old and massive with high surface gravity , which is solely based on current theoretical predictions of the spectrophotometric properties of brown dwarfs . as perhaps the only planetary - mass brown dwarfs with a dynamical mass measurement for the next several years ,",
