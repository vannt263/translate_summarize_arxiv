    "this paper deals with the existence of minimizers for an increasing functional of the first @xmath0 eigenvalues of the dirichlet laplacian , among ( quasi-)open sets in @xmath5 with unit measure .",
    "this kind of spectral minimization problems is well - studied and natural in many situations : for instance , one can be interested in minimizing a certain eigenvalue , or a linear combination of eigenvalues , or a product of eigenvalues , and so on .",
    "however , despite the big interest on the question , only very little is known in the general situation when the problem is stated in the whole @xmath1 .",
    "the reason is basically the lack of compactness for generic sequences of open sets ; in fact , given a sequence of sets of unit measure , it is not easy to understand whether or not it converges to a limit set in a suitable sense .",
    "the first existence result ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  2.5 ) , see also  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thorme  4.7.6 ) ) , which is now classical , has been found by buttazzo and dal maso in the context of bounded sets .",
    "[ bdm ] let @xmath6 be a bounded open set , and let @xmath7 be a sequence of ( quasi-)open sets of unit measure .",
    "then , there exists a subsequence @xmath8 and a ( quasi-)open set @xmath9 of unit measure such that @xmath10 for every @xmath11 . as an immediate consequence , for every l.s.c .",
    "functional @xmath12 increasing in each variable , there exists @xmath13 minimizing the value of @xmath14 among the ( quasi-)open sets of unit volume contained in @xmath15 .",
    "thanks to a concentration - compactness argument ( see for instance  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  5.3.1 ) ) , it is now well - known that the boundedness assumption ( @xmath16 for every @xmath17 ) in the theorem above can be replaced by the following slightly weaker assumption : for every @xmath18 there exists @xmath19 such that every set @xmath20 is contained in a cube of side @xmath21 up to a volume at most @xmath22 .",
    "the results described above make it simple to study spectral minimization problems inside an ambient space which is essentially bounded . on the other hand ,",
    "very little is known concerning general problems in @xmath1 , because minimizing sequences , in principle , could have a significant portion of volume moving at infinity .",
    "more precisely , the existence of a minimizer for @xmath23 and @xmath24 is clear , since it is well - known that a ball of unit volume minimizes @xmath23 , while two disjoint balls of half volume minimize @xmath24 : these two classical results are usually referred to as faber ",
    "krahn inequality and krahn  szeg inequality respectively . instead",
    ", the existence of a minimizer for @xmath25 has been proved only in 2000 by bucur and henrot ( see  @xcite ) , but it is still presently not known which set is the minimizer ( and this is a major open problem ) . for other open problems and partial results see  @xcite .    in this paper , we show that every increasing functional of the first @xmath0 eigenvalues admits a minimizer , which is in turn a bounded set . in other words , we prove that the buttazzo ",
    "dal maso theorem  [ bdm ] is true in the whole @xmath1 , with no need of the _ a priori _ boundedness assumption .",
    "the strategy of the proof consists in taking a generic open set @xmath26 of unit volume , and showing that there exists a modified open set @xmath27 which is uniformly bounded and which has all the first @xmath0 eigenvalues lower than those of @xmath28 . roughly speaking ,",
    "the basic idea why this works is that , if a set of unit volume has huge diameter , then there must be some very thin sections . and in turn , this is against the smallness of the rayleigh quotients of the eigenfunctions , since by definition they vanish on the boundary . as an immediate consequence of the above boundedness claim , there will clearly exist a uniformly bounded minimizing sequence , and therefore theorem   will follow by theorem  [ bdm ] .    during our construction , we will need the following result , simple but of indipendent interest .",
    "it is interesting to note that , in the particular case when @xmath29 , theorem   is a consequence of the stronger result by ashbaugh and benguria  @xcite , which states that not only the ratio @xmath30 is bounded , but also that the balls maximize this ratio .",
    "notice that one can not apply theorem   to study this problem , since the functional @xmath31 is not increasing in the first variable .",
    "notice also that theorem   is stated for sets of any volume ; in fact , since by trivial rescaling one finds that for every @xmath32 and every @xmath11 one has @xmath33 the ratio @xmath31 does not change by rescaling .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in section  [ ssec2 ] below we give a brief list of the notation that will be used through the paper , and some preliminaries .",
    "then , in section  [ sec2 ] we show theorem  , while in section  [ sec3 ] we show theorem  .",
    "_ * _ note : _ * dorin bucur recently announced the article in preparation  @xcite , where he gives a proof of the existence of a minimizer for the @xmath0-th eigenvalue of the dirichlet laplacian in @xmath1 ( which corresponds , in the language of our theorem  , to the particular case when @xmath34 is the projection on the last variable ) . _      throughout this paper , the ambient space will be @xmath1 for some given @xmath35 .",

    "it is well - known that the notion of eigenvalues can be extended to the realm of quasi - open sets . an important feature of the quasi - open sets is given by the theorem  [ bdm ] by buttazzo and dal maso ; namely , that any bounded sequence of open ( or quasi - open ) sets converges up to a subsequence to a quasi - open set , in the sense that all the eigenvalues converge .    through the paper ,",
    "@xmath58 will be a fixed integer , and @xmath59 will be a l.s.c . function , increasing in each variable . for the sake of brevity ,",
    "we will often write @xmath60 in place of @xmath61 ; hence , the goal of this paper can be rephrased by saying that we seek for a quasi - open set @xmath13 minimizing @xmath62 . by density , it is clear that the infimum of @xmath34 among the quasi - open sets equals the infimum among the open ( or even smooth ) sets .",
    "the letter @xmath63 will be always used to denote a big geometric constant , possibly increasing from line to line ; the constant @xmath63 will always depend _ only _ on @xmath2 and on @xmath0 ( sometimes , possibly also on some constant @xmath64 , which in turn will eventually be chosen only depending on @xmath2 and @xmath0 ) , thus _ not _ on the particular choice of @xmath34 , and _ not _ on the set @xmath28 . sometimes , we will label the constants in our results as @xmath65 for successive reference .",
