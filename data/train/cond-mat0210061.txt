    "the spontaneous polarization in ferroelectrics can be switched by applying a strong electric field opposite to the polarization direction @xcite .",
    "it is crucial to understand the details of this switching process due to many applications in memory devices and electromechanical systems .",
    "it is now a well established fact that the switching behavior is strongly influenced by nucleation , growth and motion of domain walls . due to the nucleation events ,",
    "the experimentally measured coercive field is much smaller than the _ intrinsic _ value predicted by the simple 1-d landau theory @xcite . in a recent work @xcite",
    ", we qualitatively showed that dipolar defects can act as nucleation centres for @xmath0 domain structures .",
    "however , for a constrained system , such as a grain in a ferroelectric ceramic , the surface itself is a heterogeniety that can cause localized nucleation .",
    "although , there have been some studies investigating the role of a surface on ferroelectric phase transitions @xcite , the polarization switching in finite sized systems has not been well studied theoretically .    in this paper , we study the influence of a surface during polarization switching using the time dependent ginzburg - landau model described in @xcite . in particular , we are interested in understanding the role played by the surface in nucleating @xmath0 ferroelastic domains during the switching process .",
    "recent experiments on @xmath4 single crystals @xcite have demonstrated the importance of @xmath5 domains during polarization reversal .",
    "the theory incorporates elastic and electrostrictive effects in the form of an anisotropic long - range interaction obtained by eliminating strain fields , subject to the elastic compatibility requirement . instead of using periodic boundary conditions ( corresponding to a bulk system )",
    ", we consider a finite sized constrained ferroelectric with the boundary condition of vanishing polarization at the surface .",
    "physically , this corresponds to a system where the free charge at the surface is compensated .",
    "it is believed that this charge compensation occurs at the grain boundaries in ferroelectric ceramics . due to the above discussed boundary conditions",
    ", we can neglect the effects of the depolarization field .",
    "the nonlocal interaction is represented by the appropriate polarization gradients terms in the free energy expansion .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we give details of the time dependent ginzburg - landau model , starting from a free - energy functional for the polarization field .",
    "section 3 gives details of our simulations of polarization switching for a finite square shaped system . in section 4",
    ", we describe simulations of switching behavior in a semi - infinite constrained system .",
    "we end the paper by a summary and discussion of our results in section 5 .",
    "the 3-d ginzburg - landau free energy for ferroelectric systems has been given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this work",
    ", we restrict to a 2-d system undergoing a square to rectangle transition , for which the total free - energy is given by @xmath6\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the local free - energy density given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the components of the polarization vector , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the free energy parameters .",
    "the term @xmath14 represents the gradient energy , @xmath15 + { { g_2}\\over{2}}\\bigg[\\bigg({{\\partial p_{x}}\\over{\\partial y}}\\bigg)^2 + \\bigg({{\\partial p_{y}}\\over{\\partial x}}\\bigg)^2\\bigg ] + { { g_3}\\over{2}}\\bigg({{\\partial p_{x}}\\over{\\partial x}}\\bigg ) \\bigg({{\\partial p_{y}}\\over{\\partial y}}\\bigg),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the gradient parameters .",
    "it has been shown that the gradient energy may be obtained as a local approximation to the nonlocal interactions @xcite .",
    "the term @xmath19 represents the usual elastic energy of the square system .",
    "we consider the bulk strain @xmath20 , deviatoric strain @xmath21 and shear strain @xmath22 . here",
    "@xmath23 is the linear elastic strain tensor given as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 , @xmath26 represents the dispacement components .",
    "the elastic free - energy can then be written as @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are constants that can be expressed in terms of linear combinations of elastic constants of the system .",
    "the coupling energy @xmath31 may be written as , @xmath32 here @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are constants that are related to the electrostrictive constants of the system .",
    "the term @xmath36 is given by @xmath37 the amplitude of field @xmath38 is a tunable parameter in our simulations for studying polarization switching .",
    "we assume that the system reaches mechanical equilibrium very fast so that we may integrate out the elastic fields , subject to the elastic compatibility constraint @xcite . in terms of the strain components",
    "@xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , the elastic compatibility relation is given as @xmath42 to incorporate the elastic compatibility constraint , we consider an effective elastic part of the free energy @xmath43 , with lagrangian multiplier @xmath44 , where @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 here @xmath48 and @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 are , respectively , the fourier transforms of @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "the condition of mechanical equilibrium and the compatibility relation demands @xmath55@xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "@xmath58 subject to the constraint @xmath59 using the above equations , the multiplier @xmath60 is given as @xmath61 at this stage we make a simplification by assuming that the polarization electrostrictively couples only to the deviatoric strain .",
    "this assumption will not effect the qualitative behavior of the model in context surface effects , which are the main focus of this paper .",
    "we should also keep in mind that for the present case of a square to rectangle ferroelectric transition , the deviatoric strains are the dominant mode of deformation .",
    "the bulk and shear strains are usually localized at the domain walls for this case . including the coupling with bulk and shear deformations",
    "may introduce intermediate metastable states with more complex patterns .",
    "exclusion of these couplings makes the computation faster due to faster equilibriation .",
    "finally , we should also mention that the neglect of this coupling in the free energy does not meen that bulk and shear strains will not be generated in this model at all .",
    "in fact , in this model , the strains are related to each other through the elastic compatibility relations which leads to the creation of bulk and shear strains , even under the above described approximation . in the limit of no coupling of polarization with shear and bulk strains , i.e. @xmath62 and @xmath63 , using the equilibrium conditions and the lagrange multiplier @xmath60 , the free energy @xmath64 can be expressed in fourier space as @xmath65 .",
    "the quantities @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , with @xmath69 defined as @xmath70 we have introduced dimensionless constants @xmath71 and @xmath72 .    the effective interaction derived above is strongly direction dependent and is crucial to describe the domain wall orientations .",
    "similar anisotropic interactions have been considered in context of martensitic transformations @xcite .",
    "as we wish to study heterogeneous nucleation , a dynamical formalism is needed to describe the non - equilibrium effects associated with domain switching .",
    "the time dependent ginzburg - landau model for the polarization fields is used .",
    "we introduce rescaled time variables @xmath73@xmath74 ( @xmath75 is the kinetic coefficient ) , space variable @xmath76 , the wave vector @xmath77 @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is a dimensionless constant .",
    "the polarization field is transformed as @xmath80 and @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the remnant polarization of the homogeneous state without elastic effects . with this set of parameters , the dimensionless time dependent ginzburg - landau equations are given as @xmath83 here , @xmath84 is the rescaled external electric field .",
    "the notation @xmath85 represents the time derivative .",
    "the defined constants are : @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the quantity @xmath90 is the fourier transform of @xmath91 .",
    "we now describe the details of our simulations on the switching behavior for a finite constrained ferroelectric .",
    "the long - range interaction is conveniently defined in fourier space , which allows us to use the fourier transform method .",
    "this enforces the need to have periodic boundary conditions at the surfaces . to define a finite system using this scheme",
    ", we consider an @xmath92 square region within a full simulation grid of size @xmath93 .",
    "the constraining is implemented by assuming that the polarization variables @xmath94 and @xmath95 vanish at the boundary and outside of the @xmath96 region .",
    "this configuration represents an electromechanically clamped ferroelectric in which all displacements vanish at the surface .",
    "equation ( 15 ) is discretized using the euler scheme on the above described grid .",
    "the space discretization step @xmath97 and the time interval @xmath98 .",
    "the free energy parameters chosed by us are @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the gradient coefficients are chosen as @xmath101 .",
    "similarly , we choose the elastic parameter ratios as @xmath102 .",
    "we first start from a random small amplitude initial conditions for the fields @xmath94 and @xmath95 and an external field @xmath103 .",
    "we solve equation ( 15 ) to obtain a single domain configuration with the polarization oriented towards the @xmath104 gradually decaying at the surface of the square system .",
    "figure 1(a ) shows this configuration corresponding to an electric field value @xmath103 . in this figure ,",
    "the arrows represent the local polarization vector ( we have not shown all the polarization vectors for the sake of legibility ) .",
    "notice the gradual decay of the amplitude of the vectors in the surface region .",
    "this configuration is used as the initial state for the simulations of polarization switching .",
    "equations ( 15 ) are now solved at each time step , starting from the initial configuration depicted in figure 1(a ) with a time dependent external field @xmath105 .",
    "the time dependence is given as @xmath106 $ ] , where @xmath107 is the initial electric field value and @xmath108 is the total number of simulated switching time steps . as the field decreases , the magnitude of the polarization vectors decreases uniformly every where in the simulated system at the beginning ( keep in mind that the polarization is fixed to zero at the surface for all times ) .",
    "as the external electric field approaches zero , we observe that near two of the corners , the polarization vectors are distorted towards the [ 11 ] directions .",
    "figure 1(b ) shows the pattern corresponding to @xmath109 where we can see the diagonal orientation of the polarization vectors near the corners .",
    "this indicates that shear strains are generated near the corners .",
    "the result is in agreement with recent simulations by jacobs for a constrained ferroelastic system undergoing a square to rectangle transition where it was demonstrated that nondeviatoric strains are generated at the corners @xcite .",
    "these diagonal shear strains at the corners are responsible for nucleation of @xmath0 domain walls , as seen figure 1(c)@xmath110 and figure 1(d)@xmath111 . in figure 1(e ) @xmath112 , we can clearly see a well developed twinned structure with @xmath0 domain walls .",
    "as we further decrease the field to @xmath113 , domains polarized along @xmath114 $ ] direction grow at the expense of domains polarized along @xmath115 $ ] directions , as can be seen by comparing figure 1(e ) and figure 1(f ) . in figure 1(f ) @xmath116 , we can also observe that the dipoles in the vicinity of the corners and domain walls have started reorienting towards the @xmath117 direction .",
    "thereafter , the reversed domains grow at the expense of domains polarized along @xmath114 $ ] , and eventually all the dipoles are oriented along the @xmath118 direction .",
    "this growth can be clearly seen from figure 1(g ) @xmath119 and figure 1(h ) @xmath120 .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the special role played by the corners during switching .",
    "the corners act as nucleation centres for @xmath5 domain structures .",
    "unlike the classically held belief of @xmath121 reorientation of polarization , the switching takes place by sucessive @xmath5 reorientations of the dipoles .",
    "recently , evidence for such non @xmath121 switching has been observed in rhombohedral single crystals of pzn - pt @xcite .",
    "the reverse cycle can be simulated by using the configuration in figure 1(h ) as the initial condition and increasing the field as @xmath106 $ ] , where @xmath122 and @xmath108 is the total number of switching time steps .",
    "figure 2 shows the hysteresis loops obtained by plotting the average polarization @xmath123 with the field @xmath124 .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the situation depicted in figure 1 and the dashed line corresponds to this loop for the case without any surface ( periodic boundary conditions ) .",
    "we can observe that for the case of constrained square , the simulated hysteresis loop shows a long `` tail '' region where the forward and reverse cycles curves do not close up .",
    "this corresponds to the appearence and disappearence of the @xmath5 domain pattern .",
    "in contrast , for the periodic boundary condition case , hysteresis loop has no `` tail '' region as there are no nucleation events .",
    "we can also observe that the saturation polarization and remnant polarization field are lower for the constrained system than that for the case with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "however , there is not much difference between the coercive fields of the two cases .",
    "we have simulated the hysteresis loops for different system sizes to study the size dependence of the switching phenomena . in figure 3",
    ", we show the simulated hysteresis loops for system sizes indicated at the top of each frame . a comparison of the loops for sizes @xmath125 and @xmath126 reveals that the coercive fields and the saturation polarization are almost the same for both systems .",
    "also , the @xmath5 domain structure is shorter lived for the smaller system since the `` tail '' region of the hysteresis loop for the @xmath126 system is smaller than that for the @xmath125 system . for smaller sizes , the domain pattern becomes increasingly shortlived during the switching process , as can be concluded from the loop for @xmath127 where the tail has moved further inwards .",
    "however , the saturation polarization and the coercive fields still do not show much variation .",
    "the tail almost disappears for the @xmath128 hysteresis loop and we see a small bump near the coercive field region . for this size , we can see a reduction in the coercive field as well as the saturation polarization due to the surface effects . below this size , nucleation of @xmath5 domains",
    "does not take place .",
    "the switching occurs by @xmath121 reorientations that preferentially starts at the surface .",
    "the hysteresis loops in this regime have shape similar to the periodic boundary condition case .",
    "it is clear from figure 3 that on further decreasing the size , the saturation polarization , remnant polarization and coercive field decrease rapidly .",
    "we can see that the hysteresis is very small for @xmath129 which is the smallest size simulated . for the present set of parameter values",
    ", we do not observe a ferroelectric to paraelectric transition for @xmath129 .",
    "such a transition was observed for a simulation with much higher value of the gradient coefficients .",
    "the behavior observed in figure 3 can be understood in terms of size dependence of ferroelectric behavior .",
    "it is experimentally and theoretically established that the spontaneous polarization progressively decreases on decreasing size for a system in which the polarization is constrained to decay at the surface @xcite .",
    "thus , the remnant polarization , saturation polarization and coercive field decrease on decreasing the system size .",
    "the anisotropic nonlocal interaction responsible for the nucleation of @xmath5 domain structures also decreases as the size is decreased .",
    "thus for small sizes , the hysteresis loops are free of @xmath5 nucleation .",
    "a similar transition from multidomain to single domain states on decreasing the size has been discussed in earlier works @xcite .",
    "the main effect of size reduction comes from the surface layer under the vanishing polarization boundary condition .",
    "the transition temperature is effectively reduced and the energy barrier between the low temperatures states is also lowered .",
    "in this section , we describe switching behavior for a semi - infinite constrained ferroelectric system . here",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions along the @xmath130 direction and vanishing polarization conditions at the surface for @xmath131 direction .",
    "figure 4 shows the dynamics of polarization switching for the semi - infinite case . except the boundary conditions , all other parameter values , including the time dependence of the switching field are the same as that for the case of the constrained square described in section 3 .",
    "figure 4(a ) shows the fully polarized single domain initial configuration for @xmath103 . in figure 4(b ) , we can see that a single domain persists even when the applied field is lowered to @xmath132 , although the polarization magnitude has decreased by a very small amount .",
    "as the field is further decreased to @xmath133 , nucleation of the reversed polarization domains from the two surfaces takes place , as depicted in figure 4(c ) .",
    "the reversed domains grow larger and eventually into a single domain crystal with reversed polarization .",
    "this reversed domain growth is clear from figure 4(d ) ( @xmath134 ) and figure 4(e ) ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "figure 4(f ) shows the final state corresponding to @xmath136 .",
    "figure 4 illustrates the fact that for the corner free semi - infinite geometry , the reversal occurs only by @xmath121 reorientations .",
    "the hysteresis loop corresponding to the situation shown in figure 4 can be computed . in figure 5",
    ", we plot the hysteresis loop for the case shown in figure 4 along with the loop for the surface free case with the periodic boundary conditions . unlike the case shown in figure 2 , the hysteresis loops for the surface free case and the semi - infinite case have the same shape",
    ". however , the saturation polarization , the remnant polarization and the coercive field are slightly smaller for the semi - infinite case due to the suppressed transition at the surface .",
    "we have also simulated the size dependence for this case and found that the hysteresis loops become progressively narrower with decreasing size without any shape change .",
    "this is due to the fact that there are no @xmath5 domains and the long - range elastic interaction does not play any role in this case .",
    "we have simulated the switching behavior in constrained ferroelectrics with the boundary condition of vanishing polarization at the surface .",
    "a square shaped system is considered along with a system with semi - infinite geometry .",
    "we find that the corners of the square shaped system nucleate @xmath5 domains and the switching is dominated by the motion of @xmath5 domain walls .",
    "in contrast , for the semi - infinite geometry , there is no nucleation of @xmath5 domains and the switching proceeds by @xmath121 reversal .",
    "clearly , the corners in the constrained square play a crucial role during the switching process .",
    "we believe that the anisotropy of the long - range elastic interaction interacts with the corners to produce inhomogenieties that result in @xmath5 nucleation .",
    "our results suggest that the switching behavior and the hysteresis loops in real systems may depend on the shape of the grain and its boundary conditions .",
    "we have also simulated the size dependence of hysteresis loops .",
    "the decrease of the saturation polarization , remnant polarization and the coercive field with decreasing size is common to both configurations .",
    "this can be understood in terms of the supression of the transition in an electromechanically constrained system as the system size approaches the correlation length of order parameter .",
    "the free energy for a constrained system is a function of the system size . for the constrained square case ,",
    "the polarization reversal process is dominated by intermediate @xmath5 domain pattern changes for larger systems and becomes totally via @xmath121 reorientations for size less than a critical dimension .",
    "this transition is due to the weakening of the long - range elastic interactions with decreasing system size .",
    "finally , one should note that the behavior of decreasing coercive field with decreasing size indicated by the simulation results does not apply to thin films @xcite , but only to clamped grains in ferroelectric polycrystals . for thin films ,",
    "not all the dimensions are reduced simultaneously , which is different than our condition here .",
    "in addition , the misfit strain with the substrate is important , which has to be incorporated in the theory @xcite .",
