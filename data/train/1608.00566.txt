    "though einstein s general theory of relativity has always been proved to be very fruitful for uncovering so many hidden mysteries of nature , yet the evidences of late - time acceleration of the universe and the possible existence of dark matter have imposed a fundamental theoretical challenge to this theory  @xcite . as a result , several modified theories on gravitation have been proposed from time to time . among all these theories ,",
    "few of them namely @xmath4 gravity , @xmath5 gravity and @xmath0 gravity have received more attention than any other . in all these theories instead of changing the source side of the einstein field equations , the geometrical part has been changed by taking a generalized functional form of the argument to address various galactic , extra - galactic and cosmic dynamics .",

    "to search natural relationship between geometry and matter through einstein s general relativity one can use symmetries .",
    "symmetries that arising either from geometrical viewpoint or physical relevant quantities are known as collineations .",
    "the greatest advantageous collineations is the conformal killing vectors ( ckv ) .",
    "those vectors also provide a deeper insight into the spacetime geometry . in mathematical viewpoint , conformal motions or conformal killing vectors ( ckv )",
    "are motions along which the metric tensor of a spacetime remains invariant up to a scale factor .",
    "moreover , the advantage of using the ckv is that it facilitates generation of exact solutions to the field equations . also using the technique of ckv one",
    "can easily reduce the highly nonlinear partial differential equations of einstein s gravity to ordinary differential equations .",
    "the ckv is defined as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the lie derivative operator which describes the interior gravitational field of a stellar configuration with respect to the vector field @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the conformal factor .",
    "one can note that the vector @xmath35 generates the conformal symmetry and the metric @xmath10 is conformally mapped onto itself along @xmath35 .",
    "however , harko et al .",
    "@xcite argued that neither @xmath35 nor @xmath36 need to be static even though a static metric is considered .",
    "we also note that ( i ) if @xmath37 then eq . ( 7 ) gives the killing vector , ( ii ) if @xmath38 constant it gives homothetic vector , and ( iii ) if @xmath39 then it yields conformal vectors .",
    "moreover , for @xmath37 the underlying spacetime becomes asymptotically flat which further implies that the weyl tensor will also vanish .",

    "reveal that both the density and pressure suffer from central singularity .",
    "therefore we are unable to make any comment about the core of the star . however , according to the profile of mass function ( fig .",
