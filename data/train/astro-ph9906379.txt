    "it is known that , if the initial density profile of a halo is a power law in radius , @xmath29 , ( @xmath30 is the mean density at a distance @xmath31 from a peak ) then the density profile of the collapsed halo is also a power law : @xmath32 where @xmath33 , if @xmath34 , and @xmath5 if @xmath35 ( filmore & goldreich 1984 ; bertschinger 1985 ) .",
    "the restriction on @xmath36 can be relaxed if non - radial orbits are permitted ( white & zaritsky 1992 ) .",
    "hs and hoffman ( 1988 ) related this spherical solution to dark matter halos , that form from initial gaussian density fields . in their paper they noted that the density profiles of very high peaks for @xmath37 have the same radial dependence as the correlation function of the initial field , @xmath38 .",
    "then hs set @xmath39 , obtaining : @xmath40 for @xmath3 , and @xmath5 for @xmath41 .",
    "this last conclusion ( @xmath5 for @xmath42 ) is not a direct consequence of the hs model , but it was an assumption made by the quoted authors following the study of self - similar gravitational collapse by fillmore & goldreich ( 1984 ) .",
    "in fact , as reported by the same authors , in deriving the relation between the density at maximum expansion and the final one ( see next section ) hs assumed that each new shell that collapses can be considered as a a small perturbation to the gravitational field of the collapsed halo .",
    "this assumption breaks down for @xmath42 .",
    "in reality , all the slopes of the power spectrum satisfying the condition @xmath42 constitute a big problem for sim ( zaroubi et al .",
    "in fact , as shown in zaroubi s et al .",
    "( 1996 ) simulations and lokas et al .",
    "( 1996 ) paper , the slope @xmath43 marks the transition between two different dynamical regimes . in the cosmological context",
    ", such regimes correspond to a primordial perturbation field whose power spectrum is dominated by the high wavenumber modes , @xmath44 , or by the low wavenumber modes , @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "+ in the regime @xmath42 , the energy of the particles changes violently in time , and one expects at the end a state of statistical equilibrium , similar to the violent relaxation described by lynden - bell ( 1967 ) . in this regime",
    "there is a strong dependence on the boundary conditions and the dynamics strongly depends on the last collapsing shell ( zaroubi et al .",
    "according to lokas et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for @xmath42 the fluctuations grow faster than in the linear theory .",
    "+ in the @xmath44 regime , the dynamics of the collapsed shells is hardly affected by the ongoing collapse of more distant shells . in this case , order is preserved in energy space and according to lokas et al .",
    "( 1996 ) a slowdown in the growth rate of perturbations is expected .",
    "in such a case , the sim is expected to be a useful tool for calculating the final virialized structure of collapsed halos . for these reasons in this paper",
    "we suppose that @xmath45 .",
    "+ let us also add that eq .",
    "( [ eq : bet ] ) is true only for regions outside the virial radius of a dark matter halo ( see peebles 1974 ; peebles & groth 1976 ; davis & peebles 1977 ; bonometto & lucchin 1978 ; peebles 1980 ; fry 1984 ) . in the inner regions of the halo , scaling arguments plus the stability assumption tell us that @xmath46 and we expect a slope different from eq .",

    "nusser & sheth ( 1998 ) found @xmath48 , while sheth & jain ( 1996 ) found @xmath49 .",
    "in other words , hs s ( 1985 ) solution applies only to the outer regions of collapsed halos and consequently the conclusion , obtained from that model , that dark matter halos density profiles can be approximated by power - laws on their overall radius range is not correct .",
    "it is then necessary to introduce a model that can make predictions also on the inner parts of halos .",
    "+ another problem of hs s work is the assumption that @xmath50 .",
    "this is true only for very high peaks ( see ryden & gunn 1987 ) . as the peak height decreases , the peak profile becomes steeper than the correlation function ( bbks ) and consequently the final density profile becomes steeper .",
    "moreover , according to bbks , the mean peak profile depends on a sum involving the initial correlation function , @xmath51 , and its laplacian , @xmath52 ( bbks ; ryden & gunn 1987 ) .",
    "this means that there are at least two reasons why the density profile outside the virial radius must be steeper than in hs s model :    * \\a ) peaks that give origin to structures have height @xmath53 , and not @xmath54 ; * \\b ) @xmath30 depends on a sum of @xmath55 and its laplacian , and for peaks @xmath53 is steeper than the correlation function .    inside the virial radius hs s model can not be used to predict the virialized density profile because it was a priori constructed to estimate density profiles at @xmath56 .",
    "+ that model suffers also from another drawback : namely , the assumption that the accreting matter is not clumpy , while in hierarchical scenarios for structure formation halo grows in mass by merger with less massive halos . as previously told according to zaroubi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) probably this last problem is not so difficult it , compared with the other two .",
    "+ in the following , we want to show that the predictive power of the sim is greatly improved when the problems reported at point a ) and b ) are removed .",
    "these two problems are not problems of the sim but only problems introduced by the hs s implementation of it .",
    "in the most promising cosmological scenarios , structure formation in the universe is generated through the growth and collapse of primeval density perturbations originated from quantum fluctuations ( guth & pi 1982 ; hawking 1982 ; starobinsky 1982 ; bbks ) in an inflationary phase of early universe .",
    "the growth in time of small perturbations is due to gravitational instability .",
    "the statistics of density fluctuations originated in the inflationary era are gaussian , and can be expressed entirely in terms of the power spectrum of the density fluctuations : @xmath57 where @xmath58 @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the mean background density .",

    "for example for galaxies the cdm profile is steeper than that proportional to @xmath55 as shown by ryden & gunn ( 1987 ) with a discrepancy increasing with decreasing @xmath90 .",

    "( [ eq : pee ] ) ( peebles 1980 ) is : @xmath99 the last equation must be regarded as the main essence of the sim .",

    "in this paper we have developed an improved version of the hs model to study the structure of the dark matter halos .",
    "we assumed that the initial density profile is given by the average profile given by bbks and , solving the spherical collapse model , we obtained the virialized density profile .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    * \\a ) differently from hs s ( 1985 ) model the density profiles are not power - laws but have a logarithmic slope that increase from the inner halo to its outer parts . in the outer parts of the halo , the density profiles are steeper than that found by hs and are consistent with @xmath153 , while in the inner part of the halo we find @xmath154 . the analytic model proposed by navarro et al .",
    "( 1995 ) is a good fit to the halo profiles . *",
    "\\b ) the radius , @xmath4 , at which the slope equals @xmath155 is a function of the mass of the halo and of the spectral index @xmath6 .",
    "lower mass halos are more centrally concentrated than the higher ones . for a given mass @xmath150 ,",
    "halos having larger values of @xmath6 have denser cores . *",
    "\\c ) the good agreement of our ( spherical simmetric ) model with several n - body simulations lead us to think , in agreement with huss et al .",
    "( 1998 ) paper , that the role of merging in the formation of halos is not as crucial as generally believed .",
