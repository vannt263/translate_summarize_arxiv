    "the possible violation of lorentz invariance has recently received a lot of attention , both from the experimental and theoretical sides . in the latter case , mainly in connection with possible effects arising from drastic modifications of space - time at distances of the order of planck length suggested by most of the current quantum gravity approaches .",
    "experiments and astrophysical observations set stringent bounds upon the parameters describing such violations , which nevertheless are still been subject to improvement in their precision . broadly speaking , there are two basic possibilities which produce such a breaking :",
    "( 1 ) one introduces by hand a number of non - dynamical tensor fields , whose fixed directions induce the corresponding breaking in a given reference frame . examples of this approach are the phenomenological myers - pospelov model @xcite together with qed in a constant axial vector background @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) a second possibility is to dwell upon spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) .",
    "this is basically what is done in the standard model extension @xcite , @xcite , where such non - dynamical tensor fields are assumed to arise from vacuum expectation values of some basic fields belonging to a more fundamental model , like string theory for example .",
    "nevertheless , we are interested in studying a model of electrodynamics which incorporates spontaneous lorentz symmetry breaking , without having to go to a string theory setting . in order to produce such a model",
    "we require the presence of the non - zero vacuum expectation value of a tensorial field of rank greater than zero .",
    "a first possibility arises from having a non - zero vev of the potential field @xmath3 .",
    "this case has been thoroughly studied and leads to the interesting idea that the photon arises as the corresponding goldstone boson of the global spontaneous lorentz symmetry breaking .",
    "normally the masslessness of the photon is explained by invoking abelian gauge invariance under the group @xmath4 .",
    "this almost sacred principle has undoubtedly been fundamental in the development of physics and it is very interesting to explore the possibility that it could have a dynamical origin prlnielsen .",
    "this idea goes back to the works of nambu @xcite and bjorken @xcite together with many other contributions kt , others .",
    "recently it has been revived in references kostelecky1,chkareulli , azatov , mohapatra , chkareulli1 .",
    "one of the most explored approaches along these lines starts form a theory with a vector field @xmath5 endowed with the standard electrodynamics kinetic term plus a potential designed to break lorentz symmetry via a non - zero vacuum expectation value @xmath6 , which defines a preferred direction in space - time .",
    "this potential also breaks gauge invariance .",
    "these are the so called bumblebee models @xcite .",
    "the subsequent symmetry breaking , obtained from the non - zero minimum of the potential , splits the original four degrees of freedom in @xmath5 into three vectorial nambu - goldstone bosons @xmath7 , satisfying the constraint @xmath8 , to be identified with the photon , plus a massive scalar field @xmath9 , which is assumed to be excited at very high energies . under this threshold",
    "one basically recovers the lagrangian for electrodynamics in vacuum plus the above mentioned non - linear constraint , which is interpreted as a gauge fixing condition .",
    "calculations at the tree level @xcite and to the one loop level @xcite have been carried on , showing that the possible lorentz violating effects are not present in the physical observables and that the results are completely consistent with the standard gauge invariant electrodynamics .",
    "this is certainly a surprising result , which can be really appreciated from the complexity of the calculation in ref .",
    "@xcite . nevertheless , alternative kinetic terms in the bumblebee models can lead to a theory differing substantially from electromagnetism @xcite .",
    "the use of nonpolynomial interactions within this framework has been explored in @xcite .",
    "the idea of a photon as a goldstone boson has also been extended to gravitons in general relativity @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy to recall here that the constraint @xmath10 was originally proposed by dirac as a way to derive the electromagnetic current from the additional excitations of the photon field , which now ceased to be gauge degrees of freedom , avoiding in this way the problems arising from considering point - like charges @xcite .",
    "as reported in @xcite , this theory requires the existence of an ether emerging from quantum fluctuations , but not necessarily of the violation of lorentz invariance , due to an averaging process of the quantum states producing such fluctuations .    in this work",
    "we explore the possibility of having a non - zero vev of the electromagnetic strength , so that we avoid the problem of disturbing gauge invariance from the very beginning . to this end",
    "we consider a non - linear version of electrodynamics with a potential term having an stable minimum for a constant electromagnetic strength .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we make it plausible the existence of such gauge invariant potential @xmath11 , arising as an effective low energy contribution from the integration of degrees of freedom corresponding to massive gauge - bosons and fermions in a more fundamental theory .",
    "this potential also exhibits the right behavior in the low - intensity field approximation .",
    "section iii contains the construction of the model starting from a non - linear version of electrodynamics which is spontaneously broken by choosing a vacuum characterized by a constant electromagnetic tensor @xmath12 . in section",
    "iv we discuss the possible realizations of such vacuum in terms of the associated electromagnetic fields @xmath13 and @xmath14 , identifying the lorentz subgroups that remain invariant after the breaking . the equations of motion corresponding to the propagating sector , i.e. those arising from the quadratic terms in the lagrangian , are examined in section v using a covariant approach , as well as the standard @xmath15 decomposition . also , the modified maxwell equations are presented .",
    "section vi contains a summary of the modified photon dispersion relations @xmath16 , together with the expressions for the electromagnetic fields @xmath17 and @xmath18 of plane waves propagating in the different vacua parameterized by @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the model is shown to be stable in the small lorentz invariance violation approximation . in section vii",
    "we study the embedding  of our model in the corresponding sector of the standard model extension @xcite and use the experimentally established bounds upon the liv parameters to constrain the electromagnetic fields @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "finally we conclude with a summary of the work together with some comments in section viii .",
    "the appendix contains some details of the calculation leading to the motivation described in section ii .",
    "one of the main challenges of the proposed approach is to make it plausible the existence of a gauge invariant potential @xmath19depending upon the electromagnetic tensor , which is stable for large values of the electric and magnetic fields and which possess a minimum for some constant value of @xmath20 . in particular",
    ", we will consider at this level only the case of magnetic fields in order to avoid further instabilities due to pair creation in strong electric fields .    a first possibility that arises is to consider the effective photon interaction in qed after integrating the fermions .",
    "unfortunately , a detailed calculation of this potential , in the one - loop @xmath21 and two - loop @xmath22 approximations @xcite , shows that it is given by @xmath23 -%",

    "a new possibility arises in a further generalization of the mechanism proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , restricted to the gauge invariant case .",
    "we start from a conventional gauge theory including fermions , gauge fields and higgs fields which provide masses , via spontaneous symmetry breaking , to the gauge fields , except for the photon potential @xmath3 , which carries the electromagnetic @xmath4 gauge invariance . for simplicity",
    "we consider only one fermion species , as in ref.@xcite , but the idea can be generalized to many of them . in the latter case , the subsequent integration over the fermionic degrees of freedom could be made only for those having a mass larger than a given scale , thus leaving unintegrated the lightest ones .",
    "integrating the massive gauge bosons of this theory leads to a power series in bilinears in the fermion fields , which are suppressed by powers of the energy scale @xmath25 that characterizes the ssb mechanism providing the mass to the gauge vector bosons @xcite .",
    "we focus upon the neutral sector of the model where the following contributions to the effective lagrangian arise @xmath26 ^{n},\\;\\;\\frac{1}{\\lambda ^{8n-4}}\\left[\\sum_a \\left ( \\bar{\\psi}m_{a}d_{\\nu } \\psi",

    "notice also that terms containing the @xmath4 covariant derivative @xmath27 are further suppressed with respect to those without it .",
    "also we consider only the @xmath28 case , which provides a gauge invariant generalization of the model in ref .",
    ". thus our starting point is@xmath29 .\\]]the index @xmath30 labels the tensorial objects that constitute the dirac basis : scalar , vector , tensor , pseudovector and pseudoscalar , respectively . the generic index @xmath31 labels the covariant ( contravariant ) components of each tensor class .",
    "more details are given in table i of the appendix .",
    "we follow the dirac algebra conventions of ref .",
    "@xcite , with appropriate factors chosen in such a way that each current @xmath32 is real . in this way",
    ", the proposed generalization includes all possible fermionic quartic interactions .",
    "also , the coefficients @xmath33 are assumed to be of order one .",
    "the fermions can be integrated next by introducing the corresponding auxiliary fields @xmath34 for each real current @xmath35 , as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , and following standard manipulations in the path integral formulation .",
    "some details are given in the appendix .",
    "our main goal is to estimate the additional corrections provided by such currents to the purely electromagnetic effective potential ( [ effpotqed ] ) and to investigate whether or not it is possible to generate a net positive contribution in the high - intensity field limit . to have a preliminary simpler expression for the resulting extension we choose to consider separately each of the contributions arising from the different currents and",
    "only add them to the total effective potential at the end . in this way we are nor considering possible interference terms among the currents , which nevertheless could be calculated within the approximations performed . calling @xmath36 the finite part of the total effective potential arising from the currents @xmath37 , given in eq.([totalcontr ] ) of the appendix , we obtain @xmath38 ^{2}\\sum_{m}r_{m}\\,\\theta_{m } , \\label{finalinf } \\\\ b & \\rightarrow & 0:\\;\\;\\;v^{(2)}=\\left ( \\frac{1}{16\\pi ^{2}}\\right ) ^{2}\\left ( \\frac{m}{\\lambda } \\right ) ^{2}\\left ( \\frac{eb^{2}}{3m^{2}}+\\frac{1% } { 18}\\frac{e^{2}b^{4}}{m^{4}}\\right)^2 \\sum_{m}r_{m}\\,\\theta_{m}. \\label{finalcero}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath39 is the mass of the integrated fermion which is such that @xmath40 . the main point of the estimation is that we obtain @xmath41which can be made positive from a judicious choice of the parameters @xmath42 .    in the high - intensity field approximation ,",
    "the dominant term in the electromagnetic contribution goes like @xmath43which can be overcame by the contribution from the additional currents @xmath44@xmath45 ^{2}\\theta,\\]]provided @xmath46    as we mention in the appendix , this preliminary estimation has only considered an appropriate regularization of the divergent integrals , but is missing an adequate renormalization of the total effective lagrangian @xmath47 .",

    "the renormalization procedure should be analogous to the one carried in ref .",
    "@xcitefor the two - loop contribution @xmath55 to the effective electromagnetic action and it is rather involved due to the complicated field dependence of the regularized version of the divergent integrals .",
    "this calculation is beyond the scope of these preliminary estimations .",
    "having an effective potential with the characteristics described above guarantees the existence of an absolute minimum , which we assume to arise at values lower that the critical magnetic and electric fields , in such a way to avoid fermion pair production in the later case .",
    "we also generalize this idea to the case of an arbitrary constant electromagnetic field @xmath56 .",
    "the study of the stability of the model under radiative corrections is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "in the previous section we have made it plausible the existence of a gauge invariant potential @xmath11 having an stable minimum and arising as an effective low energy model from the integration of degrees of freedom corresponding to massive gauge - bosons and fermions in a more fundamental theory .",
    "this potential also exhibits the right behavior in the low - intensity field approximation . to examine the dynamical consequences of the symmetry breaking we have to adopt a convenient parametrization of such potential .",
    "there are various choices in the literature which would translate into the following for our case @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the constant value of the electromagnetic field at the minimum .",
    "instead we will adopt the standard ginzburg - landau parametrization @xmath59 since the basic variable we want to deal with is @xmath60 , we start from the effective lagrangian @xmath61where the dual field @xmath62 is @xmath63and the @xmath64 are just lagrange multipliers that will finally impose the condition that the field strength satisfies the bianchi identity and can then be expressed in terms of the vector potential .",
    "the above lagrangian is similar to that used in the standard formulation of non - linear electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "our conventions are @xmath65 .",
