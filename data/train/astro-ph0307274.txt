    "therefore , the combined uzc+ssrs2 survey is useful for defining the large - scale galaxy density field around the sdss sample out to a distance of approximately @xmath83 .",

    "( number of observed galaxy density with distance ) of these shallower surveys drops and the thickness ( in the declination direction ) of the sdss itself is adequate to define the density field around the sdss galaxies .",
    "we search for void galaxies in the sdss using the nearest neighbor statistic .",
    "the two volume limited samples ( sdss and uzc+ssrs2 ) are used to trace the voids . any magnitude - limited galaxy that lies away from the boundary of the volume - limited sample and",
    "has less than 3 volume - limited sample neighbors in a sphere of @xmath92 is considered a void galaxy .",
    "we expand on each of these steps below .",
    "galaxies in the magnitude - limited sdss samples that lie near the boundaries of the volume - limited samples have systematically larger distances to their third nearest neighbors than galaxies that lie deep in the volume - limited samples .",
    "this is because potentially closer neighbors have not been observed / included in the sample .",
    "these galaxies have a higher probability of being selected as void galaxies than the galaxies inside the survey .",
    "we correct for this bias in the following way : we generate a random catalog with the same angular and distance limits as the corresponding volume - limited sample ( sdss and uzc+ssrs2 ) but with no clustering .",
    "we count how many random points lie around each of the magnitude - limited sdss galaxies .",
    "if the density around a galaxy is less than a certain value , we reject it from the sdss samples .",
    "this is explained further below .",
    "we count how many random points ( @xmath93 ) lie in a sphere of size , @xmath94 around each galaxy and compute the number density , @xmath95 , where , @xmath96 .",
    "since we know the number of random points , the solid angle and depth of the sdss and uzc+ssrs2 surveys , we can compute the corresponding average density of random points , @xmath97 .",
    "galaxies with values of @xmath98 , are rejected as it is their proximity to the sample s boundaries which causes a low value of @xmath99 .",
    "we apply the above procedure twice , once when we compare the distant sdss magnitude - limited sample with the sdss random catalog and again when we compare the nearby sdss magnitude - limited sample with the uzc+ssrs2 random catalog .",
    "the distant sdss sample is reduced from 65,186 galaxies to 13,742 galaxies , the nearby sdss sample is reduced from 3784 galaxies to 2,450 galaxies .",
    "the nearby sdss sample is cut less drastically as the uzc+ssrs2 sample covers a greater area .    because the sdss is not finished",
    ", the angular selection function is complicated ( see figure [ fig : surveys ] ) .",
    "an algorithm to quantify the fraction of galaxies that have been observed in any given region , i.e. the completeness , has been developed and is described in tegmark , hamilton , & xu ( 2002 ) .",
    "the completeness for any given ( @xmath100 ) coordinate is returned , allowing a random catalog with the same angular selection function to be created . for the sdss ,",
    "the completeness within the regions that have been observed is typically @xmath101 .",
    "the angular selection function for the combined uzc+ssrs2 sample is easier as the surveys are finished and the completeness for the uzc is @xmath102 .",
    "we classify galaxies that have a large distance to their _ nth _ nearest neighbor as void galaxies .",
    "we follow the work of el - ad & piran ( 1997 ) and hoyle & vogeley ( 2002 ) and use @xmath103 rather than @xmath104 in the nearest neighbor analysis . because galaxies are clustered , it is not unreasonable to expect that some galaxies in large - scale voids might be found in binaries or triplets .",
    "if we used @xmath104 then a pair of galaxies in an otherwise low density environment would not be classified as void galaxies .",
    "setting @xmath103 allows for a couple of bright neighbors , but excludes galaxies in typical groups .",
    "note that we do not make any corrections for peculiar velocities along the line of sight .",
    "therefore , we might underestimate the density of systems with large velocity dispersions , which may pollute the void galaxy population .",
    "this effect could lead us to slightly underestimate the differences between the void and wall populations .    to identify void galaxies in the sdss",
    ", we compute the distance from each galaxy in the apparent magnitude limited sample to the third nearest neighbor in a volume - limited sample . in other words ,",
    "the volume - limited sample is used to define the galaxy density field that traces voids and other structures .",
    "we compute the average distance to the third nearest neighbor , @xmath105 , and the standard deviation , @xmath106 , of this distance .",
    "we fix the critical distance @xmath107 to be @xmath92 , which is approximately equal to @xmath108 found from the two samples , ( the actual values are given in sections [ sec : dvg ] and [ sec : nvg ] ) .",
    "this threshold is consistent with the criterion for defining wall and void galaxies in voidfinder ( hoyle & vogeley 2002 ) .",
    "galaxies in the apparent magnitude limited sample whose third nearest neighbor lies further than @xmath109 are classified as void galaxies . we thereby divide the apparent magnitude limited sdss sample into two mutually - exclusive sub - samples , which we hereafter refer to as void and wall galaxies .",
    "note that boundary of the void and wall samples is defined by throwing away galaxies that lie within 3.5@xmath2mpc of the survey edge , where as galaxies are classified as void galaxies if they have less than 3 neighbors in a sphere of 7@xmath2mpc .",
    "if we use 7h@xmath110mpc to mark the boundary then the volume available for finding void galaxies is decreased , especially at the near edge of the distant sample .",
    "we tolerate this inconsistancy inorder to have overlap between the near and distant samples in terms of the magnitude ranges that each sample probes .",
    "however , this means that near the edges there is a slightly higher probability of a galaxy being flagged as a void galaxy than deep in the survey . to test",
    "what effect this has , we construct 10 mock volume- and flux - limited catalogs from the virgo consortium s hubble volume z=0 @xmath111cdm simulation ( frenk et al . 2000 ; evrard et al .",
    "2002 ) that have the same geometry as region 2 .",
    "following the procedure used in the survey data , we throw away galaxies in the flux - limited mock catalogs that lie within 3.5@xmath2mpc of the region s edge and then find the mock void galaxies .",
    "we then compute the average n(r ) distribution of the mock void and wall samples , where n(r ) is the normalized number of galaxies as a function of comoving distance , and show these in the left hand plot of figure [ fig : nrdata ] .",
    "it can be seen that within the errors , the two distributions are similar .",
    "the exception is at the near edge where more mock galaxies are classified as void galaxies , as expected . out to 125@xmath2mpc",
    "there are 50% more void galaxies than wall galaxies .",
    "this excess is only 4% of the whole void sample because most of the void galaxies are found at greater distances .",
    "the n(r ) plot for the data ( figure [ fig : nrdata ] right hand side ) indicates a somewhat later ratio of void / wall galaxies at the near edge of the sample . from the test above , only 4% of the void galaxies might be erroneously flagged .",
    "the rest of the difference is due to large - scale structure within the volume surveyed .",
    "thus we conclude that our procedure for identifying void galaxies and removing objects ( both void and wall ) near the survey boundaries does not produce any significant bias in the redshift distribution of void and wall galaxies .",
    "the difference is insufficient to generate the large observed differences between void and wall galaxies .",
    "in fact , dilution of the void galaxy sample can only decrease the apparent statistical significance of differences between the void and wall galaxy populations i.e. the true differences between void and wall galaxies may be more severe than we find .",
    "the converse is not possible ; this dilution could not cause the population differences that we observe . in section [ sec : discus ]",
    "we discuss the impact of this dilution on our results .",
    "also , tests with smaller `` clean '' samples show , as expected , a higher statistical significance and results from the nearby sample , which suffers less from this effect due to wider opening angle , and distant sample show the same trends , which is further evidence that the dilution of the distant sample is a minor effect .    to test that our procedure identifies genuine void galaxies",
    ", we compute the mean , median and upper bound of the density contrast ( @xmath112 ) around void galaxies and compare these values to the emptiness of voids as defined by voidfinder .",
    "the number of galaxies in the sdss volume - limited sample is 22,866 and the respective volume , @xmath113 , therefore , the mean density is @xmath114 .",
    "the void galaxies contain less than three neighbors in a sphere of @xmath92 , thus , the density around the void galaxies is @xmath115 .",
    "therefore , the density contrast around void galaxies in the distant sample is @xmath116 .",
    "this number is very similar for the nearby sample .",
    "it is an upper bound , as the median third nearest neighbor distance to the void galaxies is closer to @xmath117 , giving values for the density contrast closer to @xmath118 .",
    "this value is low , although not as low as that found by voidfinder for the density contrast of the voids .",
    "since we are centered on a galaxy and galaxies are clustered , we expect the density around void galaxies ( @xmath119 ) to be higher than the mean density of a void ( @xmath120 ) . recall that the mean density of a void is about @xmath121 mean density of the universe ( @xmath122 ) and since the correlation length ( @xmath123 ) on spheres of @xmath117 is @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) , then : @xmath126 .",
    "in addition , void galaxies are typically found near the the edge of the void where the density is higher .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that since most of the void galaxies will lie near the edges of voids , the typical density contrast around void galaxies is less extreme than the density contrast of the whole void region ( see figure 11 in benson et al .",
    "the average number of volume - limited galaxies in a sphere of @xmath92 around a wall galaxy is 25 compared to 2 around a void galaxy , demonstrating that void galaxies really are in highly underdense regions .      for sdss galaxies that lie in the distant sdss sample , we use the sdss volume - limited sample to define the galaxy density field .",
    "using the third nearest neighbor ( @xmath103 ) , we obtain @xmath127 , from which we obtain @xmath128 , which we round up to @xmath92 . from the distant sdss sample of 13,742 galaxies we find 1010 void galaxies .",

    ", we use the uzc+ssrs2 volume - limited sample to trace the voids because the slice - like sdss samples are too thin to detect three - dimensional voids in this nearby volume .    the number of galaxies in the sdss nearby sample , after applying the boundary corrections , is 2456 .",
    "we measure the distance to the third nearest uzc+ssrs2 volume - limited galaxy and obtain the values @xmath136 , hence the choice of @xmath137 is still applicable . in this case",

    "we compute the means of the distributions and also the error on the mean to see if on average void and wall galaxies have the same colors , concentration indices and sersic indices .",
    "we also use the _ kolmogorov - smirnov _ ( ks ) test to see if the void and wall galaxies could be drawn from the same parent population .",
    "tables 1 and 2 , summarize the results of these tests for the nearby and distant samples respectively .",
    "we present the results for the whole sample , as well as the samples split by absolute magnitude .",

    "2003 ) , and density with luminosity and color ( hogg et al . 2002 ; blanton et al .",
    "2002 ) are well known ; bright red galaxies tend to populate galaxy clusters and tend to be elliptical , while dim blue galaxies are less clustered and tend to be more disk like .",
    "this behavior is shown in an analysis of sdss galaxy photometry by blanton et al .",
    "( 2002 ; see their figures 7 and 8) , in which they find that the distribution of @xmath146 colors at redshift 0.1 is bimodal .    of particular interest to us",
    "is the location of the void galaxies in color space . because these galaxies evolve more slowly and interact less with neighboring galaxies than their wall galaxy counterparts",
    ", we might expect void galaxies to be dim , blue , of low - mass and have high star formation rates ( benson et al .",
    "we consider two color indices : @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "the reason for these two colors is that @xmath145 measures the slope of the spectrum and @xmath144 is sensitive to the uv flux and the @xmath147 break . since the @xmath148 band magnitudes can be noisy , by looking at @xmath145 and @xmath144 we are able to verify that the results are consistent and not affected by low signal - to - noise ratio .    in tables 1 and 2 , we compare the photometric properties of the void galaxy samples to their respective wall galaxy samples . in figures [ fig : color1 ] and [ fig : color2 ] we present normalized histograms of the color distributions .",
    "solid lines correspond to the void galaxy samples and the dotted lines represent the wall galaxies . in all cases ( nearby , distant and the bright and faint sub - samples )",
    "we find that the void galaxy samples are on average bluer than the corresponding wall galaxy samples in both colors .",
    "if we look at the full samples , we find that the mean values of the two samples are significantly different .",
    "the nearby void galaxies have mean @xmath144 and @xmath145 colors that are at least @xmath149 bluer than the wall galaxy samples .",
    "for the distant void galaxies , the differences in the means are about four times greater than for the nearby case .    when we split the nearby sample into the bright and faint samples , we see that it is at the faint end where there is the greatest difference between void and wall galaxies .",
    "the significance of the ks test is reduced because of the smaller number of galaxies in each sample .",
    "the nearby bright and faint void galaxies are at least @xmath150 bluer than the wall galaxies .",
    "the differences between the nearby void and wall galaxies are not as pronounced as in the distant samples because we are shot noise limited by how many clusters there are in the small nearby volume . in the distant sample",
    "it is very unlikely that the wall and void galaxies in both the bright and faint sub - samples are drawn from the same parent population ( @xmath151 ) .",
    "we assess the statistical significance of differences in the color distributions using a ks test ( the values of @xmath152 , the probability that the two samples are drawn from the same parent population , are given in the last column of tables 1 and 2 ) .",

    "it is very unlikely that the wall and void galaxies in both the bright and faint sub - samples are drawn from the same parent population ( @xmath151 ) .",
    "to compare morphological properties of void and wall galaxies , we examine the distribution of concentration indices measured by the sdss photometric pipeline ( lupton et al . 2001 ; stoughton et al .",
    "2002 ; pier et al .",
    "2002 ; lupton et al .",
    "the concentration index ( ci ) is defined by the ratio @xmath154 , where @xmath155 and @xmath156 correspond to the radii at which the integrated fluxes are equal to @xmath157 and @xmath158 of the petrosian flux , respectively .",

    "2001 ; shimasaku et al .",
    "spiral galaxies are usually found to have small concentration indices ( @xmath159 ) whereas ellipticals have larger concentration indices ( @xmath160 ) .",

    "the void and wall galaxies are not distinguished by this morphological parameter . in table 1 , we find that the mean values of ci are very similar . the probability that the distributions of concentration indices of void and wall sub - samples are drawn from the same parent population approaches unity and @xmath161 for the faint and bright sub - samples respectively .",
    "the top row of plots in figure [ fig : cin ] , shows there is indeed little difference between the distributions of ci for the void and wall galaxies in these samples .",
    "we find that void galaxies have on average significantly smaller concentration indices in the bright half of the distant samples .",
    "there are more wall than void galaxies at large values of ci ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "the means differ by more than @xmath163 . in figure",
    "[ fig : cin ] , in the bottom row , all three dotted curves show this behavior . in table 2 , it is clear that in the full sample and in the bright sample , the wall and void galaxies have significantly different ci distributions .",
    "a ks analysis of the bright sub - sample reveals that there is a probability of less than @xmath164 that the void and wall galaxies are drawn from the same parent population . in the case of the distant faint void and wall galaxy samples",
    "the results are consistent .      as another measure of morphology of void and wall galaxies",
    "we examine the sersic index ( sersic 1968 ) , found by fitting the functional form @xmath165 , where @xmath166 is the sersic index itself , to each galaxy surface brightness profile ( sbp ) . with this form",
    ", @xmath104 corresponds to a purely exponential profile , while @xmath167 is a de vaucouleurs profile .",

    "the top panels of figure [ fig : nser ] , show histograms of the sersic index ; the distributions of the void ( solid lines ) and wall ( dotted line ) galaxies appear very similar .",
    "we find significant differences between void and wall galaxies in the distant samples .",
    "the lower panels in figure [ fig : nser ] , show the distribution of sersic indices for the void and wall galaxies . for the more distant void galaxies ,",
    "we find in table 2 , that @xmath169 , which is higher than what was found for the nearby void galaxies ( @xmath170 ) .",
    "a ks test reveals that the void galaxies are distinct from the wall galaxies with a probability of @xmath151 in the fainter ( @xmath171 ) , brighter ( @xmath172 ) and full samples that the void and wall galaxies are drawn from the same parent population .",
    "the means of the sersic indices of the void and wall galaxies differ by at least @xmath173 .",
    "the above analysis clearly shows that there is a difference in the photometric properties of void and wall galaxies .",
    "void galaxies are fainter and bluer than wall galaxies in all cases .",
    "previous observational studies ( e.g. , vennik et al .",
    "1996 ; pustilnik et al . 2002 ; popescu et al .",
    "1997 ) suggested that isolated galaxies in voids can be distinguished from non - void galaxies based on their color with a large enough sample .",
    "here we provide such a sample and even extend the analysis to compare sub - samples of void and non - void galaxies of similar luminosity and sbp .",
    "nearby , the question might be raised as to whether it is the faintest void galaxies that are particularly blue and that these galaxies dominate the statistics . to test for this , the nearby sample is cut at -17.0 , reducing the range of absolute magnitude in each bin and again the void galaxies are bluer than the wall galaxies .",
    "a further test was made where the galaxies were divided into bins of @xmath174 mag and still the void galaxies are bluer in every bin , thus the differences in color are not dominated by the tail of the distribution .",
    "void galaxies are genuinely bluer than wall galaxies of the same luminosity .    in the distant sample",
    "the differences in color are only partly explained by the paucity of luminous red galaxies in voids .",
    "the average galaxy in the distant sample has an absolute magnitude of around -19.5 which is more than a magnitude fainter than an @xmath175 galaxy in the @xmath14-band ( @xmath176 blanton et al .",
    "galaxies that are thought of as bright red cluster ellipticals are typically brighter than @xmath175 . in the full sample , the faint sample and the bright sample ( and in the @xmath174 mag test ) void galaxies",
    "are still bluer than wall galaxies .",
    "in section [ sec : nn ] we noted a small excess of void galaxies near the inner boundary of the volume that encloses the distant samples .",
    "we predicted that this might affect the purity of our void galaxy samples and thereby lower the apparent statistical significance of differences between the void and wall galaxy populations . to test for this effect ,",
    "we redo selected analyses , to compare the photometric properties of void and wall galaxies in the range of comoving coordinate distance from @xmath177 to @xmath178 , far from the region where the excess is observed near the @xmath179 inner boundary .",
    "we find that the differences between the photometric properties of void and wall galaxies are indeed larger for galaxies in this more restricted redshift range .",
    "for example , @xmath144 , @xmath180 , and @xmath145 the differences rise to @xmath181 .",
    "the sense of these differences is the same as for the larger sample ; void galaxies are bluer and of later type than wall galaxies .",
    "we bother to include the more nearby , perhaps slightly diluted , void galaxy sample in our full analysis because it allows us to probe a larger range of absolute magnitude .",
    "in fact , we find consistency of results in the nearby and distant samples over the range of absolute magnitude where these samples overlap .",
    "the statistical significance is comparable perhaps because the nearby samples are relatively smaller , albeit purer .",
    "we expect that the statistical significance of these comparisons will rise in future , more complete samples from the sdss",
    ".    one might ask if the observed differences in color are simply the result of the well - known morphology density relation , extrapolated down to lower densities : blue spiral galaxies are found in low density environments , while red ellipticals are found in clusters .",
    "this explanation seem unlikely in the nearby samples , where the surface brightness profiles of void and wall galaxies are quite similar .",
    "thus , in the nearby samples , the difference in color is not clearly linked to morphology . in the distant samples , however , we see a morphological difference between the void and wall sample ; there are more elliptical type galaxies in the wall sample . to test",
    "if the difference in color is caused simply by the paucity of ellipticals in voids , we divide the distant sample by sersic index .",
    "blanton et al .",
    "( 2002 ) use @xmath182 to represent exponential disks and @xmath183 for the de vaucouleurs profiles whereas vennik et al .",
    "( 1996 ) use @xmath184 for exponential law fits and @xmath185 for early type galaxy profile fitting .",
    "we examine the color distributions of void and wall galaxies with sersic index less than 1.8 and greater than 1.8 to approximately split the sample into spirals and ellipticals .",
    "we find that the void galaxies with both @xmath186 and @xmath187 are bluer than the wall galaxies . in @xmath144 and @xmath145 and for",
    "both @xmath186 and @xmath187 the void galaxies are at least 3@xmath188 bluer than the wall galaxies , and for the @xmath186 , @xmath145 case the difference rises to 7@xmath188 .",
    "again , the samples are divided into bright and faint sub - samples as well as by sersic index .",
    "the void galaxies are always bluer than the wall galaxies , although the significance of the ks test is reduced because of the smaller number of galaxies .",
    "thus , void galaxies are bluer than wall galaxies even when compared at similar sbp and luminosities .",
    "they are also fainter and have surface brightness profiles that more closely resemble spirals than ellipticals .",
    "these findings are consistent with predictions of void galaxy properties from a combination of semi - analytic modeling and n - body simulations of structure formation in cold dark matter models ( benson et al .",
    "one of the reasons why void galaxies are bluer than galaxies in richer environments may be that star formation is an ongoing process in void galaxies .",
    "galaxies in clusters and groups have their supply of fresh gas cut off .",
    "therefore , star formation is suppressed in the wall galaxies .    to illustrate the range of luminosities probed by this study , we consider which members of the local group could have been included in our samples at the distances probed by the sdss volume .",
    "not only the brightest members of the local group ( lg ) , but also local group members like m31 and m33 can be detected in the distant sample , and fainter ( @xmath189 ) members of the lg , like the lmc and smc , would be included in the nearby sample .",
    "in the nearby sample we can detect faint dwarf ellipticals ( de s ) , which is to be expected given that about @xmath190 of the known galaxies in the lg are dwarfs ( sung et al .",
    "1998 ; staveley - smith , davies & kinman al . 1992 ) .",
    "it is well known that while de s have exponential sbp s ( sandage & binggeli 1984 ; binggeli , tammann & sandage 1987 ; caldwell & bothun 1987 ) they exhibit color gradients that redden outward ( jerjen et al .",
    "2000 ; vader et al . 1988 ; bremnes et al .",
    "1998 ) and have a uniform color distribution ( james 1994 ; sung et al . 1998 ) . based on their color and other properties ,",
    "a fraction of the void galaxies resemble a population of dwarf ellipticals ( de s ) , which have a mean @xmath191 ( kniazev et al . 2003 ) , typical de s have sersic indices @xmath192 and @xmath193 , consistent with our sample of nearby void galaxies ( see table 1 ) .",
    "using a nearest neighbor analysis , we identify void galaxies in the sdss .",
    "for the first time we have a sample of @xmath12 void galaxies .",
    "these void galaxies span a wide range of absolute magnitudes , @xmath194 , are found out to distances of @xmath67 , and are found in regions of the universe that have density contrast @xmath195 .    in previous studies of properties",
    "void galaxies it was suggested ( vennik et al .",
    "1996 ; pustilnik et al . 2002 ; popescu et al .",
    "1997 ) that void galaxies could be distinguished from non - void galaxies based on their color , and a hint of them being bluer was observed ( grogin & geller ( 1999 , 2000 ) from a small sample of void galaxies . in this paper",
    "we present a definitive result with a sample of @xmath196 void galaxies for which the colors , concentration and sersic indices are compared against wall galaxies .",
    "void galaxies are bluer than wall galaxies of the same intrinsic brightness and redshift distribution down to @xmath197 .",
    "we demonstrate that the difference in colors is not explained by the morphology - density relation .",
    "nearby , void and wall galaxies have very similar surface brightness profiles and still the void and wall galaxies have different colors . in the distant sample",
    "the voids and wall galaxies have different surface brightness profiles . however , when we divide the populations further by sersic index , the void galaxies are still bluer . to test that the differences in color are not due to the choice of absolute magnitude range",
    ", we compare the colors within narrow bins of absolute magnitude .",
    "this reveals that void galaxies are genuinely blue and that the differences between the colors are not dominated by extreme objects in the tails of the void and wall galaxy distributions .",
    "analysis of surface brightness profiles indicates that void galaxies are of later type than wall galaxies .",
    "comparison of the sersic indices between the distant void and wall galaxy samples including , sub - samples within a narrow range of luminosities shows that it is very unlikely ( @xmath151 ) that the two samples are drawn from the same parent population .",
    "however , based on the concentration index , it is only the bright distant void and wall galaxy samples that differ by significantly .",
    "our results are in agreement with predictions from semi - analytic models of structure formation that predict void galaxies should be bluer , fainter , and have larger specific star formation rates ( benson et al .",
    "the differences in color are probably best explained in terms of star formation .",
    "void galaxies are probably still undergoing star formation whereas wall galaxies have their supply of gas strangled as they fall into clusters and groups .    in a separate paper ( paper ii ; rojas et al .",
