    "in his seminal paper @xcite , giroux established the surprising one - to - one correspondence between the contact structures up to isotopy and the open book decompositions up to positive stabilizations on a given closed oriented three - manifold .",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "it becomes natural and convenient for topologists to study contact structures in the viewpoint of open book decompositions .",
    "for legendrian knots , akbulut and ozbagci @xcite showed that for any legendrian link @xmath0 in @xmath1 with the standard contact structure @xmath2 , there exists a compatible open book such that @xmath0 sits in a page of the open book , furthermore , the framing of l given by the page of the open book agrees with the contact framing .",
    "see also @xcite",
    ".    in @xcite , etnyre and ozbagci introduced the definition of support genus for a contact three - manifold , which is the minimal genus of a page among all open books supporting the given the contact three - manifold . in a similar fashion , onaran defined in @xcite an invariant for legendrian knots in a contact three - manifold as follows .",
    "let @xmath0 be a legendrian knot in a contact three - manifold @xmath3 , the _ support genus _ of @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath4 , is the minimal genus of a page among all open book decompositions of @xmath5 supporting @xmath6 such that @xmath0 sits on a page of the open book and the framings given by @xmath6 and given by the page coincide .",
    "ding and geiges @xcite introduced the definition of contact surgeries along a legendrian link .",
    "if a contact three - manifold @xmath7 is obtained by a contact @xmath8 surgery along a legendrian knot @xmath0 in @xmath9 , onaran showed that @xmath4 is greater than or equal to the support genus of @xmath7 ( ( * ? ? ? * remark 5.11 ) ) . in the same paper , the following question",
    "is asked :    does every legendrian knot in @xmath9 with negative thurstion - bennequin invariant have support genus zero ?    in the present paper , we study the support genus of certain legendrian knots in @xmath9 .",
    "first , for legendrian torus knots , we have the following    suppose @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a legendrian torus knot @xmath11 in @xmath9 with nonnegative thurston - bennequin invariant , then @xmath12 .",
    "next , we study the support genus of legendrian twist knots @xmath13 , where @xmath14 .",
    "( see @xcite for the meaning of @xmath13 . ) in particular , @xmath15 is the right handed trefoil .",
    "all legendrian twist knots are classified in @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xmath13 has @xmath16 legendrian representatives with thurston - bennequin invariant one and rotation number zero , and has a unique legendrian representative with thurston - bennequin invariant minus one and rotation number zero ( ( * ? ? ? * theorem 1.1 ( 4 ) ) ) .",
    "we have the following    suppose @xmath17 and @xmath18 are natural numbers .",
    "let @xmath0 be a legendrian representative of the twist knot @xmath13 in @xmath9 with thurston - bennequin invariant @xmath19 .",
    "then @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the positive and negative stabilizations respectively .",
    "theorems 1.3 and 1.4 both computed the support genus of some legendrian right - handed trefoil knots . by the classification results in @xcite , the remaining legendrian right - handed trefoil knots are @xmath23 and @xmath24 for @xmath25 .",
    "the support genus of these legendrian knots is computed in the following theorem , and thus we computed the support genus of all legendrian right - handed trefoil knots .",
    "let @xmath0 be a legendrian right handed trefoil knot in @xmath26 with thurston - bennequin invariant @xmath19 . then for any integer @xmath25 , both @xmath23 and @xmath24 have support genus @xmath19 .",
    "this gives a negative answer to question 1.2 .",
    "in fact , legendrian knots with positive support genus can have arbitrarily negative thurston - bennequin invariant .",
    "our strategy is the following .",
    "we will construct a fibered link with a thurston norm minimizing seifert surface which contains the interested knot . by computing the thurston - bennequin invariant and rotation number of the legendrian realization of this knot and",
    "known classification results , we will be able to determine the legendrian knot and get an upper bound for the support genus for it . in the other direction ,",
    "we use the heegaard floer contact invariant to get lower bound for the support genus . combining these results",
    ", we will compute the support genus of our interested legendrian knots .",
    "part of the work was done when the first named author was visiting peking university .",

    "the surface @xmath27 illustrated in figure [ fig : open_book_2_2kplus1 ] is a punctured torus and contains an embedded torus knot @xmath11 in its interior .    as illustrated in figure",
    "[ fig : stabilization_2_2kplus1 ] , @xmath27 can be obtained by a sequence of positive stabilizations from the disk .    by @xcite",
    ", @xmath27 can be viewed as a page of an open book decomposition of @xmath28 which supports the standard tight contact structure @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath29 can be realized as a legendrian knot since @xmath29 is homologically nontrivial ( in fact , nonseparating ) in @xmath27 , which we denote by @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , the contact framing of @xmath30 coincides with the page framing induced by @xmath27 .",
    "this is because the contact planes can be arranged to be arbitrarily close to the tangent planes of the pages .",
    "let @xmath31 be a push - off of @xmath30 along the surface @xmath27 , then @xmath31 represents the contact framing of @xmath30 .",
    "the thurston - bennequin invariant of @xmath30 equals to the linking number of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , which is easily seen to be @xmath32 . by the classification of legendrian representatives of torus knots in @xcite , @xmath30 has the maximum thurston - bennequin invariant over all legendrian representatives of @xmath11 and it is the unique one .",
    "so the support genus of the legendrian knot @xmath30 is at most @xmath19 . according to @xcite ,",
    "all other legendrian representatives of the torus knot @xmath11 can be obtained by stabilizing @xmath30 .",
    "thus , by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.9 ) , the support genus of any legendrian representative of @xmath11 is at most @xmath19 .    on the other hand , since a legendrian knot in a weakly fillable contact structure with positive thurston - bennequin invariant has positive support genus ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 5.4 ) ) , the support genus of @xmath30 is at least @xmath19 .",
    "therefore the support genus of @xmath30 is @xmath19 .",
    "this ends the proof of theorem 1.3 .",
    "by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.9 ) , it suffices to show that the legendrian representative of the twist knot @xmath13 with thurston - bennequin invariant minus one and rotation number zero has support genus zero .",
    "the punctured sphere illustratd in figure [ fig : open_book_twist ] contains the twist knot @xmath13 in its interior .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath27 is a page of an open book decomposition which corresponds to @xmath33 .",
    "since @xmath29 is not null homologous in @xmath27 , @xmath29 can be made legendrian and the contact framing of @xmath29 coincides with the page framing induced by @xmath27 .",
    "the linking number of @xmath29 and its push - off along @xmath27 is @xmath34 , by the same argument as in the previous section , the thurston - bennequin invariant of @xmath29 is @xmath34 .",
    "below we shall compute the rotation number of @xmath29 .",
    "we turn the open book decomposition shown in figure [ fig : open_book_twist ] into an abstract open book decomposition @xmath35 shown in figure [ fig : abstract1_open_book_twist ] , where @xmath36 is a punctured sphere which is homeomorphic to @xmath27 , and @xmath37 denotes the right handed dehn twist along @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "if we perform a legendrian surgery along @xmath29 , then we obtain a stein fillable tight contact manifold which corresponds to the planar open book decomposition @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath41 be the stein surface obtained from @xmath42 by attaching a two - handle corresponding to the legendrian surgery along @xmath29 .",
    "let @xmath43 be the first chern class of this stein surface , and @xmath44 be the generator of @xmath45 supported on the attached 2-handle , then @xmath46 .",
    "the open book decomposition in figure [ fig : abstract1_open_book_twist ] is the same as the one in figure [ fig : abstract2_open_book_twist ] ,    where each upper horizontal segment is identified with the corresponding lower horizontal segment to form a one - handle .",
    "we consider the kirby diagram in figure [ fig : kirby_diagram_stein ] ,    where the framings are labelled with respect to the blackboard framings .",
    "according to @xcite , this kirby diagram presents a stein surface , denoted by @xmath47 . by handle cancellation , it is not hard to see that @xmath48 and @xmath49 are diffeomorphic .",
    "since the induced contact structures on @xmath50 by @xmath41 and @xmath51 are isotopic , we have @xmath52 by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.2 ) .",
    "let @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 denote the 1-handles attached to @xmath57 to form @xmath58 .",
    "let @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath55 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 be the cores of the 2-handles attached to the curves @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath55 , @xmath65 and @xmath29 , respectively , and let @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath55 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 be the cocores of the 2-handles .    in the tight contact manifold @xmath70 supported by the open book decomposition @xmath71 , we can legendrian realize @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath55 , @xmath65 and @xmath29 .",
    "moreover , by the argument in section 3.1 in @xcite and figure 5 , we can easily compute their rotation numbers as @xmath72 and @xmath73 . also according to section 3.1 in @xcite , the class @xmath74 is poincar dual to @xmath75    the cores of the 2-handles form a basis of the 2-chain groups @xmath76 ; @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 together form a basis for the 1-chain groups @xmath77 , and the boundary map sends @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath55 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 .",
    "thus , @xmath44 , the generator of @xmath84 , can be presented by @xmath85 .",
    "so @xmath86 , and hence @xmath87 .",
    "figure [ fig : open_book_twist ] and the argument in this section are inspired by @xcite .",
    "suppose @xmath27 is a page of an open book decomposition supporting @xmath9 , and @xmath29 is a homologically nontrivial simple closed curve in @xmath27 , then we can legendrian realize @xmath29 . to compute the rotation number of @xmath29",
    ", we perform some necessary positive stabilizations to @xmath27 so that the resulting surface can be obtained from a disk by some positive stabilizations .",
    "note that there exists open book decomposition supporting @xmath88 and can not be obtained from a disk by positive stabilizations , see @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the legendrian knot @xmath29 does not change in this procedure .",
    "so we can factor the monodromy of the open book decomposition or the new one as a product of positive dehn twists .",
    "therefore we can directly apply the method here to compute the rotation number of @xmath29 .",
    "by the classification of legendrian representatives of torus knots in @xcite , there are @xmath89 legendrian right handed trefoil knots @xmath90 with thurston - bennequin invariant @xmath91 .",
    "we order them by @xmath92 such that @xmath93 .",
