    "a significant proportion of all proteins in a typical eukaryotic cell are membrane proteins .",
    "these are found anchored to cell membranes .",
    "many of these carry out tasks such as signal transduction , pore or channel formation , cytoskeletal binding etc@xcite .",
    "others are involved in endocytosis and exocytosis . in particular",
    "it is now understood that the formation of clathrin coated pits is driven by the controlled geometric aggregation of clathrin which exert corresponding forces on the cell membrane@xcite .",
    "there also exists a less well understood class of membrane invaginations , known as caveolae , that are less morphologically distinct than clathrin coated pits and resemble aspherical invaginations with a typical size of the order of 100nm@xcite .",
    "there is good evidence that caveolae are involved in endocytosis@xcite and play an important role in cell signaling@xcite .",
    "intriguingly they are probably also involved in the sensing of shear - stress@xcite .",
    "such stresses would be expected to act on the tension @xmath0 of the cell membrane .",
    "thus , the present work may yield predictions for some of the direct physical consequences of surface tension , e.g. on inter - protein forces . in section",
    "[ analysis ] we discuss some qualitative effects of surface tension although a quantitative analysis of the effect of shear on membrane tension is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "recent elegant experiments demonstrate that better control of the surface tension may be achieved via micropipette aspiration facilitating studies of the effects of tension on membrane elasticity@xcite and permeability to water @xcite .",
    "it has now been shown that caveolins@xcite , a recently discovered class of membrane - bound proteins , are necessary for the formation of caveolae .",
    "these caveolins have a short membrane spanning sequence and n- and c - terminus polypeptide  tails \" , totalling about 150 amino acids , _ both _ found on the cytoplasmic side of the cell membrane .",
    "it is thought that these caveolin molecules are typically found in small aggregates of size @xmath3 ( a few nm ) containing of approximately 15 molecules@xcite .",
    "a crude thermodynamic ( entropic ) bound on the bending moment would be @xmath4 , higher for larger aggregates .",
    "many theoretical studies have sought to calculate the effect of adsorbed polymer on flexible , fluid membranes , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "one reason for this approach is that the simplified models available from polymer physics allow for a more or less exact computation of the entropic pressure exerted by the polymer on the membrane .",
    "our work represents a generalization of this approach .",
    "an anchored polymer is but one example , or model , of a membrane inclusions that exerts a force on the membrane .",
    "any membrane protein that is nt perfectly symetrical across the membrane should exert forces , the distribution of which will be dictated by the precise protein configuration .",
    "furthermore , it can be argued that the physical effect of integral membrane protein can also be described by a well chosen force distribution .",
    "hence there is a need for a general theory on the effect of arbitrary force distributions on flexible membrane .",
    "our premier interest are large peripheral membrane protein such as caveolin .",
    "our theory is , however , general enough to be applied to any flexible fluid interface with fixed tension , containing embedded impurities .",
    "much of the previous work on interaction between membrane - bound objects has focused on membranes with vanishing surface tension@xcite , although there have been exceptions @xcite .",
    "this work exists within the context of an extensive literature on membrane mediated interactions on tensionless membranes , see e.g. @xcite , which focussed mainly on casimir - like forces originating from membrane fluctuations .",
    "it was argued that these could be either attractive or repulsive depending on the temperature and certain details of the model .",
    "the interest in tensionless membranes has its origin in the fact that isolated , self - assembled lipid membranes should be tensionless at equilibrium .",
    "importantly this is not the case for many cell membranes .",
    "other studies include tension as a ( shape dependent ) parameter determined self - consistently for closed membrane surfaces@xcite .",
    "a study of the behavior of membranes under constant surface tension may shed light on the physics occurring on biological membrane , which are not truly at equilibrium and hence bear substantial tensions@xcite .",
    "cells commonly adjust their surface tension to a set value via a mechanism known as surface - area - regulation@xcite .",
    "hence membrane phenomena over sufficiently long timescales effectively occur at constant surface tension .",
    "previous studies of the effects of rod - like objects embedded in fluid membranes@xcite and impurities at gas - liquid interfaces@xcite share certain similarities with this study .",
    "our aim is to construct a theoretical model for the membrane - mediated interactions between proteins bound to cell membranes . to achieve this",
    "we will denote the normal membrane displacement from its average flat state as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a 2d vector in the plane of the unperturbed membrane .",
    "motivated by a desire to analyze small membrane deviations we employ an expansion of the free energy of the membrane in powers and gradients of @xmath7 .",
    "the free energy of a deformed fluid membrane , without inclusions , is well approximated by@xcite @xmath8\\label{fmemb}\\ ] ] which represents the truncation of an arbitrary expansion at order @xmath9 ( odd orders are excluded by symmetry ) and at the second derivatives of @xmath7 . for a planar membrane , with normal in the @xmath10-direction , the gradient operator is @xmath11 .",
    "the only two parameters that are needed to describe the physics of the membrane are @xmath1 , the elastic bending modulus ( typically@xcite @xmath12 for biomembranes ) and @xmath0 the surface tension ( estimated to be @xcite @xmath13 to @xmath14pn / nm ) .    to include the work done by the pressure ( normal force per unit area ) @xmath15 exerted by one or more inclusions we exploit the fact that , for small deviations , the work done is merely the surface integral of the product of pressure and distance .",
    "the displacement has no effect on the pressure field at this order . thus the total free energy , including the effect of inclusions is @xmath16 \\label{f}\\ ] ] where the term involving @xmath15 is chosen to have a minus sign to ensure that the membrane displacement has the desired sign . at thermodynamic equilibrium",
    "the free energy @xmath17 must reach its minimum value , at which point @xmath5 satisfies the euler - lagrange equation @xmath18 with @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 indicating an intrinsic length scale @xmath22 nm ( with perhaps @xmath23 ) .",
    "we solve this under the boundary condition @xmath24 and that @xmath25 exists .",

    "we now seek to find the green s functions of these self adjoint operators .    for @xmath30",
    "we solve @xmath32 the only boundary conditions compatible with this equation are neumann conditions at infinity i.e. @xmath33 .",
    "this corresponds to the membrane being asymptotically flat and yields the well known green s function of poisson s equation in 2-d @xmath34 where @xmath35 is an arbitrary constant with dimensions of ( length)@xmath36 .",
    "we choose @xmath37 for convenience , this choice corresponds only to a definition of the zero of the free energy .    for @xmath31 we must solve @xmath38 subject to the boundary conditions specified above .",
    "this self adjoint problem has linearly independent solutions @xmath39 and @xmath40 . these are , respectively , the zeroth order modified bessel functions of the first and second kind .",
    "the function @xmath41 diverges as @xmath42 therefore we write the green s function as @xmath43 this gives us the solution of equation ( [ euler ] ) , subject to the stated boundary conditions as @xmath44 with the greens function @xmath45\\label{ugreens}\\ ] ]    equations  [ usolution ] and [ ugreens ] represent a solution for the equilibrium membrane displacement @xmath5 due to an arbitrary force distribution .",
    "the formal analysis is concluded in the appendix , where we show that this solution is unique .      consider a fluid membrane with two ,",
    "not necessarily identical , inclusions bound to it .",
    "denote the pressure fields acting on the membrane surface due to each inclusion by @xmath46 and @xmath47 . without loss of generality we may let @xmath46 be centered at the origin and",
    "let the vector @xmath6 joining the centers of the pressure distributions lie along the x - axis .",
    "mathematically this means that we write the total pressure distribution as    @xmath48    where @xmath49 is the pressure distribution of the second inclusion centered at @xmath6 , rather that the origin .",
    "hence the free energy at equilibrium is given by @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the self energy of the i@xmath52 inclusion and @xmath53 is the interaction energy .",
    "we are interested only in @xmath53 as this is what determines the physics of interest to us here . by direct analysis or analogy with electrostatics",
    "this may be expressed as    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the real space green s function .",
    "for the case that we have two inclusions with circular symmetry we are able to determine the interaction potential exactly .",
    "consider two circularly symmetric inclusions i.e. @xmath56 such that @xmath57 for @xmath58 , where @xmath3 is some maximum radius of the inclusion .",
    "also each pressure field is such that no average force acts ( @xmath59 ) . for inclusions which are not anchored to external structures , such as the cytoskeleton , this condition must be satisfied on general grounds .",
    "indeed newton s third law requires that any average force applied to the membrane by an inclusion must be equal and opposite to the reaction force applied by the inclusion to some external structure .",
    "if there is no external structure for this reaction force to act against then there can be no average force on the membrane .",
    "we assume that the pressure fields do not overlap so that @xmath60 . under these assumptions the logarithmic term in",
    "gives a vanishing contribution to the integral due to gauss theorem .",
    "it corresponds to the electric field due to two circularly symmetric charged discs in 2-d , each carrying no average charge and thus with zero field in the region outside both discs .",
    "this analogy will be revisited when we discuss non - circularly symmetric inclusions in section  [ multipole ] below .",
    "the potential between two circularly symmetric inclusions is therefore given by @xmath61 the upper limits of integration are both @xmath3 since @xmath62 for @xmath63 .",
    "we make use of the identities @xmath64 valid for @xmath65 , and @xmath66 valid for @xmath67 .",
    "thus we are able to derive an exact analytical form for the interaction potential between non - overlapping ( @xmath60 ) circularly symmetric inclusions @xmath68 where @xmath69 characterizes the strength of the i@xmath70 membrane / inclusion coupling . by employing the expansion of @xmath71 the quantity @xmath72",
    "can be thought of as a series of moments of the force distribution .",
    "the radial force is , as usual given by the derivative of the potential @xmath73 .",
    "the interaction is everywhere _",
    "repulsive_. some previous studies have reported attractive interactions between polymer chains grafted on tensionless membranes@xcite . in these studies",
    "the position @xmath74 of the chain grafting point was fixed , effectively by a lagrange force which then acted to ensure that there was no average force , although this condition was not identified explicitly by these authors . in the case of vanishing tension",
    "it was found that there was no interaction between inclusions unless they  touch \" , i.e. their force fields overlap .",
    "one can understand this as follows : for tensionless membranes the membrane deformation under the force field is dictated by the minimisation of an energy similar to but with @xmath75 .",
    "the membrane deformation outside the extent of the force field simply minimises the curvature energy , hence has a zero mean curvature and does not contribute to the total energy . as two inclusions approaches each other ,",
    "the total energy does not change until one force field couples to the membrane deformation directly under the other force field , since the deformation energy of any piece of membrane that it not in direct contact with a force field is zero .",
    "there is no characteristic lengthscale @xmath76 to give the interactions finite range when @xmath75 . in consequence , inclusions interact only when the two force fields overlap . in the case of grafted ideal polymer chains ,",
    "the energy is decreased when the force fields overlap because they both want to deform the membrane in the same direction , resulting in an attraction .",
    "we note that the interaction between overlapping membrane inclusions is very sensitive to the direct physical , rather than membrane mediated , interactions between them , unlike which is universal . in the @xmath77 limit",
    "gives vanishing interactions , entirely consitant with these earlier results for tensionless membranes .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction recent experiments on the effect of shear forces on living cells provide a crude control on membrane tension . in future studies we plan to calculate the precise effect of this on , e.g. surface phase equilibria and budding phenomena .",
    "membrane - mediated interactions between membrane - bound inclusions have been extensively studied theoretically @xcite with , however , relatively little discussion of how experiments could easily support these predictions .",
    "although presumably long range , these interactions are expected to be quite small , and are probably often dominated by stronger , ( bio)chemically specific , short range phenomena .",
    "long range interactions can , however , profoundly influence the phase behaviour of certain membrane proteins even if stronger , short range interactions , are present . as we emphasise below studies of such surface phases",
    "might provide an indirect probe of the membrane mediated interactions of interest here .",
    "this might be of particular relevance for the study of the phase behaviour of the protein caveolin , which is found at high density on certain membrane invaginations called caveolae ( see sec.i ) .",
    "one peculiar feature of the caveolae bulbs is their texture .",
    "distinct striations are seen at the surface of these buds@xcite ( see also fig.13.48 in @xcite ) .",
    "these are now thought to correspond with the organization and alignment of caveolin oligomers on the membrane @xcite .",
    "the observation of these surface stripes is intruiging , and the reader may find it interesting that radially symmetrical oligomers can give rise to non - symmetrical surface phases .",
    "we discuss this below , arguing that the stripe phase may be a signature of the membrane mediated repulsion between protein aggregates , such as those calculated in section  [ analysis ] .",
    "indeed , studying the phase behaviour of membrane inclusions may provide one of the best ways to test theory against experiment in this field .",
    "molecular dissection of the caveolin protein has shown that caveolin oligomers strongly attract each other through contacts of specific protein sequences@xcite ( a short range attraction ) .",
    "it is well known that a solution of particle interacting via hard core repulsion and a short range attraction undergo a gas / liquid phase separation .",
    "this results in large dense regions ( the liquid ) coexisting with less dense regions ( the gas ) .",
    "the caveolin oligomer being anchored to the cell membrane , there exists an additional membrane - mediated , longer range repulsion between between them , as demonstrated in section  [ analysis ] , which allow for a more complex phase behavior .",
    "it has been recently argued at the light of computer simulations@xcite that a long range repulsion should break the gas and liquid phases into microdomains .",
    "the short range attraction still locally drives a gas / liquid phase separation , but large aggregates are costly because of the long range repulsion .",
    "the microdomains are circular liquid islands at low density , circular gas regions at high density , and stripes otherwise .    to gain a quantitative understanding of how stripes may form on caveolae we study the stability of an homogenous ( 2-d ) solution of oligomers of area @xmath78 interacting via a potential @xmath79 , which include a short range ( the particle size @xmath3 ) attractive exponential interactions and the longer range membrane mediated repulsion of : @xmath80 , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are respectively the strength of the attraction and the repulsion .",
    "we look at small perturbations @xmath83 ( with the conservation rule @xmath84 ) around the average surface coverage @xmath85 .",
    "the free energy includes the pair interaction and the translation entropy of the inclusions , for which we use the gas - on - a - lattice model . expanding the free energy : @xmath86 the fourier transform @xmath87 allows us to investigate the formation of structures .",
    "it leads to @xmath88 if @xmath89 , the fourier transform of @xmath79 , is sufficiently negative ( attractive ) for a given mode @xmath90 then @xmath91 and the mode is unstable . substituting the expression for @xmath79 , we obtain @xmath92 \\label{stripes1}\\ ] ]    in the absence of long range repulsion , the most unstable mode is always @xmath93 ( macrophase separation ) , and the liquid / gas transition is observed provided @xmath94 .",
    "because of the membrane - mediated long range repulsion , the function @xmath95 presents a minimum if @xmath96 ( for the typical numbers @xmath97 nm and @xmath98 nm ) .",
    "one sees that although the strength of membrane - mediated interaction ( ) is expected to be quite small : @xmath99 ( see sec .",
    "v.a , or ref.@xcite for a more detailed analysis ) , it is of much longer range , and should be competent to produce a well ordered phase .",
    "the phase separation occurs preferentially for a mode given by @xmath100 , and periodic arrays of dense and dilute regions are observed . in the limit @xmath101",
    "the structure have a typical size @xmath102 which is independent of the range of the repulsion : @xmath103 .",
    "it thus defines dense stripes of width about @xmath104 particle diameters , which agrees quite well with the experimental observations .",
    "the existence of a stripe phase at the surface of the biological structures known as caveolae is thus quantitatively consistent with the existence of a membrane - mediated repulsion between proteins described by .",
    "this analysis does not help us to discriminate between circular domains and stripes .",
    "computer simulation have clearly shown that this transition indeed exists for high enough surface coverage@xcite .",
    "note that the formation of striped mesostructures in membrane have been predicted on the basis of curvature effects only@xcite .",
    "however , it can be shown that their existence at the surface of invagination of such large curvature as the caveolae ( @xmath105 nm ) is inconsistent with the existence of invaginations with a well defined size .",
    "if the force distribution of the inclusions is not circularly symmetric then no general analytic solution to exists .",
    "however we can still proceed by examining the far - field interactions of slightly asymmetric inclusions . in order to do this",
    "we will parameterize the asymmetry of the @xmath106 inclusion by @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are cartesian indices , @xmath110 controls the average ( isotropic ) magnitude and @xmath111 controls the anisotropy of a slightly  elliptical \" force distribution , extended in the @xmath112-direction and contracted in the @xmath113-direction ( for @xmath114 ) .",
    "this force distribution can be rotated by the usual rotation matrix @xmath115 to obtain the effective moment @xmath116 of an  elliptical \" force distribution rotated by an angle @xmath117 relative to the @xmath112-axis .",
    "this expression involves two rotations , one for each factor of @xmath118 in .",
    "it is important to first note is that the interaction can be separated into two terms , one that is an integral involving @xmath119 and the other that is an integral involving @xmath120 .",
    "the first of these terms gives a contribution to the interaction potential that is dominated by a term like , with corrections due to the asymmetry that are smaller ( and also asymptotically exponentially short ranged ) .",
    "this conclusion is independent of the precise choice of asymmetry , provided only that it is small .",
    "the contribution from the second term is more interesting and can be shown to give rise to a small but _ long ranged _",
    "correction @xmath121 to the interaction potential",
    ". this can be best understood by way of multipole - like expansion of @xmath122 where @xmath123 and we choose the direction of @xmath124 to define the @xmath112-axis ( the 1 direction ) , without loss of generality .",
    "thus @xmath125 and @xmath126 are the @xmath112 and @xmath113 components of @xmath127 and @xmath128 the conditions of no overall force @xmath129 and no overall moment @xmath130 for each inclusion mean that the first non - vanishing contribution to @xmath131 , the classical result for electrostatic quadrupole - quadrupole interactions in two dimensions . using @xmath132 in to leading order in @xmath133",
    "we have hence @xmath134 with the interactions defined by the kernal @xmath135 and the result follows by contracting over all indices . ]",
    "@xmath136    this result demonstrates that elliptical inclusions attract if arranged so that with @xmath137 an integer , as reported in an earlier study of rod - like inclusions@xcite .",
    "this condition represents a degenerate family of orientations in which the orientation of the quadrupoles has reflectional symmetry about the mid plane .",
    "this perturbative interaction is long - ranged , scaling like @xmath138 .",
    "interestingly this dominates the exponentially short ranged repulsion from for large enough separations .",
    "there is a straightforward way to understand the appearance of an algebraic potential for anisotropic inclusions .",
    "the physics of and is that of the poisson equation in which the force distribution is analogous to the electrostatic charge .",
    "the potential due to a point charge in 2d is therefore .",
    "gauss law tells us that there is no field outside a circularly symmetric charge distribution that has no overall charge ( imbalance ) .",
    "this condition is analogous to our requirement here that there be no overall force @xmath139 by newton s law .",
    "if there is no field the potential is constant ( zero without loss of generality ) and no forces act on the inclusions .",
    "however , if we relax the condition that the force ( charge ) distribution is circularly symmetric there is no longer a simple symmetry argument that the radial and azimuthal components of the field must be zero .",
    "indeed they are not . as is usual in multipole expansions in electrostatics an algebraic potential results .",
    "it is here analogous to the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction in electrostatics , since there are no dipole moments @xmath140 .",
    "this is due to the fact that there can be no external first force moment ( torque ) on the membrane if it is not anchored to any external structure against which the moment can act .",
    "the physical consequences of these interactions are potentially significant . in spite of the fact that the dominant interaction is repulsive the surface concentration of membrane inclusions",
    "may often be maintained at fairly high surface fractions by the regulatory mechanisms of the living cell .",
    "the composition of the surface coats of caveolae may be further enriched in several important membrane components , including cholesterol and proteins in the caveolin family , as well as others@xcite .",
    "this means that there is an effective surface pressure , driven by a chemical potential difference that forces the inclusions to partially overcome their repulsion .",
    "in this situation the attractive @xmath141 interactions might become significant , leading to an in plane anisotropic phase separation such as is observed in model systems@xcite and on the coats of caveolae@xcite . for caveolae the typical interactions seem too weak @xcite to be solely responsible for the stripe morphology , which may rather be dominated by specific attractions , see section  [ stripesection ] @xcite .",
    "finally the existence of an attractive interaction that can arise from fluctuations in the inclusion force distribution ( shape ) , as parameterized by @xmath111 , suggests the possibility of an attractive , fluctuation driven force reminiscent of van der waals forces .",
    "this mechanism should extend to systems such as wetting droplets at gas - liquid interfaces .",
    "these can potentially exert much stronger forces on the interface , resulting in a more exaggerated effect ( see section  [ wettingtheory ] ) .",
    "up to this point we have merely postulated the existence of a force distribution @xmath142 due to a membrane bound inclusion .",
    "this force can arise from direct mechanical effects , such as due to the geometry and shape of the inclusion , e.g. the protein clathrin , or entropic effects due to the asymmetric anchoring of , e.g. flexible hydrophilic polymers , to a membrane .",
    "the budding of caveolae is now thought to be driven by the protein caveolin which is known to form small oligomers resembling a number of polypeptide chains extending only from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane@xcite .",
    "we have in mind that we have demonstrated that interactions should exist in general , but havent yet adressed the question of how big they might typically be .",
    "we are particularly interested in any models that can be chosen to be broadly comparable with membrane proteins . in this section",
    "we will present two examples of models for the origin of a force distribution arising from anchored polymer chains . this approach represents the application of a simple , and hence rather  idealised \" , theory drawn from polymer physics .",
    "its exact quantitative applicability to polypeptide chains is almost certainly limited to a small subset of peptide sequences which either resemble a diffuse random coil or a dynamic , dense hydrophobic globule .",
    "nontheless in the absence of any detailed microscopic information on a specefic inclusion s configuration and stability the approaches that we outline below probably represent the best chance for us to obtain a rough idea of the likely scale of the effects that we have described in this article .",
    "it is quite possible that the forces exerted by membrane proteins with significant well defined tertiary structure may be somewhat higher than the estimates that we will present below .",
    "this encourages us to consider our estimates as approximate lower bounds on the scale that these effects might reach .    in polymer physics terminology the two models that we consider for the force applied by a membrane - bound polymer will correspond to the two limiting of  good \" and  poor \" solvent conditions respectively@xcite .",
    "we will discuss below how these models might apply to caveolin homo - oligomers .",
    "other recent studies of the physics of flexible polymers grafted onto tensionless fluid membranes@xcite undoubtedly share similar motivation .",
    "one feature that these earlier studies all have in common is that there is only an attraction for polymer force distributions that overlap one - another on the surface of the membrane and , when this is the case , the interaction is _ attractive_. this is opposite in sign to the interactions that we predict on membranes that bear tension , see .",
    "furthermore our interactions are extended , with ranges @xmath143 .      motivated by possible biophysical relevance we investigate the effect of flexible polymer chains anchored to a small patch of membrane , of radius @xmath144 .",
    "we assume that the chains are in a good solvent , i.e. that they are found in extended , hydrated random coil configurations .",
    "the chains form a hemisphere of outer radius @xmath145 , see figure  1 .",
    "this model may be used to treat polymer homo - oligomers made up of a general number @xmath146 of chains . as such it shares many features with those that are known for caveolin homo - oligomers@xcite .",
    "within the  corona \" of the polymer hemisphere , at radial distances @xmath147 from the center of the polymer aggregate , there exists a characteristic correlation length @xmath148 for the polymer chains which crudely , represents the spatial distance between collisions between the segments of a chain with other chains or the membrane@xcite .",
    "the conservation of number of chains implies@xcite @xmath149 for @xmath150 .",
    "this is since the surface area of a hemisphere of radius @xmath151 is filled by close packed blobs , up to a constant of order unity . from this one",
    "may immediately deduce the scaling of the correlation length @xmath152 .",
    "the work done in generating each blob is @xmath153 , independent of the blob size .",
    "thus we may write the pressure in this region as the energy per blob divided by the volume of a blob@xcite @xmath154 for @xmath150 . for @xmath63",
    "the pressure is here assumed to be zero .",
    "nonetheless we consider our approximation to be as good as any alternative and insist that , at large distances , the pressure must ultimately vanish due to the finite lengths of the polymer chains ] . the pressure in the core binding region",
    "is assumed to be constant and must involve a total force equal and opposite to that applied by the corona so that no average force acts , as required by newton s second law .",
    "@xmath155 where @xmath156 is a characteristic energy related to the force applied at the center of the aggregate .",
    "this model represents one approximate framework for the understanding of forces applied by membrane biopolymers , see fig  [ brush ] .",
    "it possesses several important features : it involves no average force being applied to the membrane .",
    "it involves no average first force moment by symmetry .",
    "the first non - vanishing moment is the second , corresponding to a bending moment with magnitude controlled by @xmath157 with the characteristic energy scale @xmath158 that is entropic in origin .",
    "models similar to this have been proposed elsewhere@xcite although , as emphasized previously , the physical behavior of these inclusions on fluid membranes that are under tension is rather different .",
    "we now proceed to give an estimate of the membrane deformation and interaction potentials due to membrane - bound biopolymers within the good solvent polymer brush model described above .    for biological membranes primarily comprised of a bilayer of phospholipids",
    "the tension and rigidites are typically@xcite @xmath159 where @xmath160 refers to what we would take as a single  typical \" value for biological membranes . from this",
    "we obtain the lengthscale @xmath161 which may crudely be identified with the range of the interactions .",
    "the deformation at @xmath162 is @xmath163 in a frame where @xmath164 at infinity .",
    "this therefore represents the total magnitude of the normal deviation of the membrane expressed in terms of a dimensionless ratio @xmath165 and a characteristic length @xmath166 .    for parameters that might be typical of caveolin homo - oligomers , @xmath167 and @xmath168",
    ", we find @xmath169 much the same as for slightly larger inclusions with @xmath170 and @xmath171 @xmath172      the interaction energy is expressed as @xmath173 which is the product of an energy @xmath174 , typically of the order of @xmath175 , and a dimensionless number @xmath176 .",

    "this represents the natural opposite limit to the good solvent polymer model considered above . in the poor solvent case",
    "we propose to model the inclusion as if it were a fluid droplet that partially ` wets ' the membrane surface@xcite . at any point on the circumference of the drop the forces per unit length ( due to the surface energy )",
    "are in equilibrium . resolving these force perpendicular to the membrane we find a total force acting upward @xmath182 where @xmath3 is the radius of the drop , @xmath183 is the energy cost per unit area of producing the interface between the inclusion and the external poor solvent , typically water , and @xmath184 is the contact angle given by young s law@xcite .",
    "since we are in equilibrium this force must be balanced by the force acting on the interface between the drop ( inclusion ) and the membrane for @xmath185 . to find the corresponding pressure we need only consider the partial wetting droplet as if it formed part of a larger sphere .",
    "the pressure is constant everywhere inside the sphere and is given by the laplace law @xmath186 where @xmath187 is the radius of the sphere .",
    "the radius @xmath188 can therefore be related to the volume of the drop ( and @xmath3 ) by simple geometry .",
    "hence we may write the pressure distribution as @xmath189 where @xmath190 is the heaviside unit step function .",
    "this model represents a different possible physical origin for the pressure distribution that might be valid , e.g. for surface - anchored hydrophobic polymers in the poor solvent regime , when little water penetrates the protein chains , see fig  [ drop ]",
    ". it also preserves the same features as the good solvent polymer model : it involves no average applied force or first force moment and has a bending moment @xmath191 that is enhanced by the localization of part of the force distribution around the exterior circumference @xmath192 of the inclusion s footprint on the membrane .",
    "the characteristic energy scale is now chemical in origin , as it is controlled by chemical parameters such as @xmath183 .",

    "this large energy suggests thermodynamically  strong \" interactions .      for @xmath180 , @xmath196 , and a curvature radius for the surface of the drop @xmath197 .",

    "we show that a model for the interactions between inclusions bound to fluid membranes can be solved exactly for circularly symmetric inclusions bound to membranes that are under tension .",
    "we argue that proteins bound to cell membranes can apply no average force , or first moment of force , to the membrane unless they are also anchored to an external structure , such as the cytoskeleton . by this",
    "we mean that the total of any and all forces that the membrabe protein acts to apply downwards against the membrane must exactly equal the magnitude of similar forces applied upwards .",
    "this is a consequence of newton s laws of motion .",
    "we proposed idealized models for the origin of these forces due to either entropic or direct chemical interactions .",
    "the interactions between two circularly symmetric inclusions are _ repulsive _ and are asymptotically exponentially short ranged with a typical extent on biological membranes that is of the order of @xmath22 nm .",
    "this result contrasts with the attraction predicted to appear between similar inclusions on tensionless membranes . for non circularly symmetric inclusions",
    "we predict an additional algebraically long - ranged attractive contribution .",
    "we discuss how competing attractive and repulsive interactions are known to sometimes produce a stripe - like morphology .",
    "these phases are reminiscent of the stripes observed on the surface of caveloae , which we refer to as  gnarly buds \" , and we discuss how a similar lateral phase separation could occur in these systems with typical length scales comparable to the ranges of the interactions .",
    "we believe that the results discussed here may have wider applications in understanding biological phenomena , including lateral phase separation in phospholipid membranes and endocytotic budding .",

    "thus the only admissible solution of the homogeneous equation is @xmath5 = constant this correspond only to a redefinition of the zero of the displacement and so without loss of generality we take this constant to be zero . this freedom of choice is a consequence of the translational symmetry of the problem in the direction perpendicular to the planar membrane .                                                                                             is given by eq  ( [ cc ] ) and represents the force per area applied to the membrane by the polymers .",
