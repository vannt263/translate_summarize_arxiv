    "given a curve @xmath0 , consider the geometric flow @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the curvature and @xmath3 the binormal component of the frenet - serret formulae @xmath4    the flow can be expressed as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the usual cross - product , and @xmath7 denotes arclength .",
    "this flow appeared for the first time in 1906 @xcite and was rederived in 1965 by arms and hama @xcite as an approximation of the dynamics of a vortex filament under the euler equations .",
    "this model is usually known as the localized induction approximation ( lia ) .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite for an analysis and discussion about the limitations of this model . starting with the work of schwartz in @xcite , the lia has been also used as an approximation of the quantum vortex motion in superfluid helium .",
    "of particular relevance for our purposes is the recent work of t. lipniacki @xcite , @xcite",
    ". a rather complete list of references about the use of lia in this setting can be found in these two papers .",
    "some of the explicit solutions of are the line , circle and helix .",
    "it is easy to see that the tangent vector @xmath8 remains with constant length , so that we can assume that it takes values on the unit sphere .",
    "differentiating , we get the following equation for @xmath9 : @xmath10 this equation , known as the schrdinger map equation on the sphere , is a particular case of the landau - lifshitz equation for ferromagnetism @xcite and can be rewritten in a more geometric way as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the covariant derivative and @xmath13 is the complex structure of the sphere . written in this way , admits an immediate generalization and we can change both its definition domain ( considering for instance more variables ) and its image ( considering other more complex varieties ) .",
    "we will insist on the second possibility , choosing also the hyperbolic plane @xmath14 as the target space ; in that case , the equation for @xmath9 is @xmath15 and , equivalently , for @xmath16 , @xmath17 with @xmath18 defined as @xmath19 in this article , we study numerically the self - similar solutions of @xmath20    where @xmath21 has been defined as @xmath22    equivalently , a generalized version of the scalar product , denoted by @xmath23 , is given as @xmath24    by using @xmath25 , we can consider simultaneously the euclidean case , corresponding to @xmath26 and the hyperbolic case , corresponding to @xmath27 .",
    "equivalently , whenever we use @xmath28 , the @xmath27 sign will refer to the euclidean case and the @xmath26 sign to the hyperbolic one . using the @xmath21 notation ,",
    "the equation for @xmath29 is now @xmath30    if @xmath31 , it is still possible to give a generalized version of the frenet - serret trihedron for each point of the curve @xmath16 , formed by @xmath9 and two other vectors @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "indeed , a few calculations show that , for both cases , all the possible generalizations of have the form @xmath34    where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 ; with regard to @xmath21 , we have @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 . without loss of generality , we can choose one of the coefficients @xmath41 , @xmath42 or @xmath43 to equal zero .",
    "if we make @xmath44 and denote @xmath45 and @xmath46 , becomes @xmath47 in the euclidean case , @xmath32 and @xmath33 refer to @xmath48 and @xmath3 respectively . in the hyperbolic case , we can refer to @xmath2 and @xmath49 as the generalized curvature and torsion . in both cases , it is possible to recover @xmath16 , except for some rigid motion , if @xmath2 and @xmath49 are known .",
    "the self - similar solutions of have been studied in @xcite in the euclidean case and in @xcite in the hyperbolic one -see also @xcite , @xcite for some related work .",
    "they are such that if @xmath50 solves , so does @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , taking @xmath52 and defining @xmath53 , the self - similar solutions will be of the form @xmath54 bearing this in mind , after some straightforward but tedious computations @xcite , the family of solutions in which we are interested is defined by @xmath55    where @xmath56 is the family parameter and @xmath57 is the solution of @xmath58    @xmath59 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 being the components of the generalized frenet - serret formulae ; the initial conditions for are @xmath60    finally , for @xmath61 we define @xmath62    it can be easily shown that , for an arbitrary @xmath63 , we have @xmath64    the one - parameter family of self - similar functions we have just defined satisfies the following theorem :    [ teorema ] given @xmath65 , the @xmath66 defined by , and is a @xmath67 solution of , @xmath68",
    ".    moreover , there are @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and a constant @xmath73 such that    1 .   @xmath74}(s)| \\le c\\sqrt t. $ ] 2 .",
    "we have the following asymptotics : @xmath75 where the superindex @xmath76 when @xmath77 and @xmath78 when @xmath79 .",
    "3 .   @xmath80 and @xmath81 are vectors , with @xmath82 and @xmath83    we have combined in this theorem the results for both the euclidean and the hyperbolic cases , proved in @xcite and @xcite , respectively",
    ". naturally , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath73 are different in each case .",
    "it follows from this theorem that there exists a solution to such that @xmath86}(s),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and , correspondingly for , @xmath87}(s).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] observe that both and are time reversible , because if @xmath50 and @xmath88 are their respective solutions , so are @xmath89 and @xmath90 .    therefore , we have two one - parameter families of regular solutions that develop singularities at finite time . in the case of @xmath16 , we have precisely a corner - shaped singularity , having thus a good model to describe some natural phenomena . in figure [ onera ] , for instance , we have plotted on the left hand - side the evolution of @xmath50 , obtained by integrating , and on the right hand side , a picture of an experiment published in onera @xcite , where several lines of colored fluid in water show the symmetrical pair of vortices behind an inclined delta wing , with a high reynolds number .",
    "the resemblance between both images is really striking , at least at the qualitative level .",
    "in fact , in both images we clearly see the self - similar behavior of the evolution of the filaments .",
    "also in both cases the filaments tend asymptotically to two non - parallel lines .",
    "finally , both pictures have in common the oscillatory behavior , and the shift of the horse - shoe - type of curve that is close to the vertex with respect to the plane that contains the two asymptotic lines .",
    "see also figures 7.5.7 and 7.8.6 of plate 2 in @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to know if this resemblance is not just at the qualitative level .",
    "notice that theorem [ teorema ] quantifies in a precise manner the above mentioned properties for the self - similar solutions of the lia .    the main difference between the euclidean and the hyperbolic case is the fact that @xmath91 i.e. , @xmath92 grow exponentially with @xmath56 in the hyperbolic case .",
    "thus , although @xmath9 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are also bounded in the hyperbolic case for a given @xmath56 , this is by no means trivial , unlike in the euclidean case ; moreover , there are no global bounds valid for all @xmath56 and the bounds grow very fast even for relatively small values of @xmath56 . in figure [ figure bound ] , for instance , we have plotted the euclidean lengths of @xmath9 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the hyperbolic case , for @xmath93 ; the lengths are seen to be @xmath94 .",
    "this fact makes the proof of theorem [ teorema ] much more difficult in the hyperbolic case , as well as the numerical treatment of and for large values of @xmath56 .",
    "now , is invariant under translations and also under rotations in the euclidean case and under lorentz transformations with unitarian determinant in the hyperbolic case ; hence , given two arbitrary @xmath95 in @xmath96 or @xmath14 , we can transform , so that @xmath95 have the form as in part ( iii ) of theorem [ teorema ] . then",
    ", it is possible to obtain the corresponding @xmath56 . observe that for all @xmath97 there is a corresponding @xmath56 .",
    "however , when @xmath98 , which can be reduced to @xmath99 , @xmath56 should be infinity , so there is no real @xmath56 matching that case .    there is a natural connection between equations ( [ xtposneg ] ) and ( [ ttposneg ] ) , and the nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "equation ( [ xtposneg ] ) can be transformed into the schrdinger equation with a cubic nonlinearity via a transformation introduced by hasimoto @xcite .",
    "especifically , define @xmath100 then , @xmath101 satisfies the equation @xmath102 for some function @xmath103 , which can be removed by means of an integrating factor .    equation ( [ ttposneg ] ) can be transformed into a nonlinear schrdinger equation by performing a stereographic projection onto the complex plane .",
    "if we define @xmath104 then @xmath105 satisfies the equation @xcite @xmath106 in this article , we study the self - similar solutions described above from a numerical point of view , in order to understand the singularity formation , as well as the mechanism for energy concentration that is responsible for the formation of such singularity .",
    "these solutions can be studied at the level of @xmath107 ( eq . ( [ xtposneg ] ) ) , @xmath108 ( eq . ( [ ttposneg ] ) ) , @xmath101 ( eq . (",
    "[ cubic - schrodinger ] ) ) , or at the level of @xmath105 ( eq . ( [ nonintegrable - schrodinger ] ) ) .",
    "however , we will not work directly with ( [ xtposneg ] ) , given that @xmath107 can be recovered from @xmath109 except for a constant of integration that is fixed by considering , i.e. , @xmath110 although there is a rich literature concerning the numerical study of and , in general , the landau - lifshitz equation ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , the materials analyzing the numerics of the self - similar solutions we are considering are very scarce ; the most relevant results were given by buttke some twenty years ago @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , buttke only considered the forward case , starting with a singular initial datum at @xmath111 and going forward in time ; we are interested in the singularity formation process , and therefore will focus mostly in the backward case , i.e. , starting from @xmath112 , we will approach the singularity time .    moreover , we are not aware of any other study of the hyperbolic case . for small @xmath56 ,",
    "the results of both cases are virtually identical ; because of that , we have used in our experiments @xmath113 .",
    "in contrast , for bigger @xmath56 , because of the rapid growth of the euclidean lengths of @xmath9 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( see figure [ figure bound ] ) , the hyperbolic case becomes much more difficult to treat numerically , requiring a finer study , which we postpone for the future .",
    "the three equations ( [ ttposneg ] ) , ( [ cubic - schrodinger ] ) , and ( [ nonintegrable - schrodinger ] ) are posed in the whole real line . to carry out the numerical simulations",
    ", we must restrict ourselves to an interval @xmath114 $ ] ( for @xmath115 large enough ) .",
    "it is important then to give appropriate boundary conditions in order to capture the singularity formation mechanism . in @xcite ,",
    "only periodic boundary conditions were considered .",
    "the experiments performed here constitute numerical evidence of the stability of , and , and in particular of the robustness of the energy concentration mechanism .",
    "indeed , one can never introduce numerically completely exact boundary conditions at @xmath116 ; in the best of the cases , there will be small errors due to machine precision and in the worst one , we will be using very rough boundary conditions .",
    "therefore , we can consider that we are computing perturbed versions of the exact solutions .",
    "in a recent series of articles @xcite banica and vega prove the stability of the solutions that we consider at the level of @xmath108 . at the level of @xmath101 , banica and",
    "vega @xcite also prove that a logarithmic instability appears when @xmath117 comes close to zero .",
    "notice that @xmath108 involves one integral with respect to the curvature and two with respect to the torsion . in our case",
    "these are highly oscillatory integrals so that , due to the cancelations , @xmath108 and @xmath107 become stable .",
    "these results give the theoretical basis to the numerical results presented here , and suggest that it is better to work numerically with the equations at the level of @xmath108 or @xmath118 .",
    "therefore , we consider only equations ( [ ttposneg ] ) , and ( [ nonintegrable - schrodinger ] ) .",
    "we return now to the issue of boundary conditions . for equation ( [ ttposneg ] )",
    ", we consider two types of boundary conditions , derived from the asymptotics of @xmath9 given in theorem [ teorema ] .",
    "the first boundary condition is simply @xmath119 and for the second one , we keep the first - order term in the asymptotics of @xmath120 and use the fact that @xmath121 .    for equation ( [ nonintegrable - schrodinger ] )",
    ", we consider three types of boundary conditions : the first one is the projected boundary condition used for @xmath108 , the second boundary condition is derived from the self - similarity condition , i.e. , @xmath122 . unlike the former one , this condition is not an approximate one , so it introduces no noise , giving very clean results . finally , we derive a radiation boundary condition .",
    "this condition seems to perform best , and in contrast to the previous two conditions , can be used in the progressive case .",
    "the remainder of the article is organized as follows : equation ( [ ttposneg ] ) is considered in section [ section findif ] , where we use a simple spatial discretization using finite differences .",
    "the nonlinearity in the equation and the constraint @xmath108=1 , make it difficult to construct efficient implicit methods for these equations @xcite .",
    "for the two boundary conditions mentioned earlier , we observe an stability constraint of @xmath123 .",
    "the first condition only reproduces the singularity formation from a qualitative point of view , while the second one gives good results for all @xmath7 , even for very small @xmath117 , although a very small @xmath124 may be needed .    in section [ section spectral ] , we consider equation ( [ nonintegrable - schrodinger ] ) .",
    "this equation adapts well to a pseudo - spectral method using chebyshev polynomials ; comprehensive information about this family of polynomials can be found , for instance , in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we use also a chebyshev point distribution , which is now much better suited , since a denser concentration of points is required near the boundary for small @xmath117 and , specially , for big @xmath115 , which is when the pseudo - spectral method really excels .    in order to measure the accuracy of our results ,",
    "we compute the error in the curvature obtained from @xmath9 ( which , when necessary , can be recovered from @xmath105 as well ) , since the correct curvature has the known value @xmath125 .",
    "finally , the stability results of banica and vega are described in section [ section stability ] .",
    "we consider equation @xmath126 \\\\ { \\mathbf t}(s , 1 ) = { \\mathbf t}^0(s ) .",

    "d. thesis , buttke considered the following crank - nicholson type numerical scheme to integrate the euclidean version of @xcite : @xmath127 where @xmath128 represents the approximation to the second derivative using standard centered differences , i.e. , @xmath129 buttke only studied the forward case , i.e. , starting from @xmath111 and , concentrating all the information of @xmath9 at @xmath130 , he tried to recover the self - similar solutions we have described above , by imposing periodic boundary conditions at @xmath131 .    the scheme used by buttke s is implicit , and he used a fixed - point iteration method to advance to the next time step . for this iteration to converge , a time step @xmath132 is needed .",
    "therefore , although the method is a priori unconditionally stable , in practice it is not .",
    "we have observed that an explicit finite difference scheme is equally efficient ; more precisely , a scheme using a second - order finite difference scheme in space with the classical fourth order runge - kutta in time works well . in what follows ,",
    "we have considered the backward case , starting at @xmath112 and trying to arrive at @xmath133 .",
    "we divide @xmath134 $ ] in @xmath135 equally spaced parts , @xmath136 , with @xmath137 equation is discretized as @xmath138 and the time - stepping is carried out with the classical fourth order runge - kutta . by using a fourth order runge - kutta , we guarantee that @xmath35 is preserved with high accuracy .",
    "nevertheless , we normalize @xmath9 at every time step by doing @xmath139 a higher order finite difference scheme could be effortlessly implemented , although we have observed that this does not improve significantly the quality of our results .",
    "experimentally , @xmath140 is found to be needed for the method to be stable .",
    "thus , as in buttke s method , we have a @xmath141 restriction , but it is straightforward to advance to the next time step .    from theorem [ teorema ] , we know that the self - similar solution @xmath142 has the following asymptotic expansion : @xmath143 we approximate the boundary conditions for by the values of @xmath144 , and consider two types of boundary conditions :    1 .",
    "first order boundary conditions : @xmath145 2 .",
    "second order boundary conditions : @xmath146 normalized to be of length @xmath147 . in , we use the leading order in the asymptotics for @xmath33 , obtained from theorem [ teorema ] on page [ teorema ] as well .      we set @xmath148 and obtain the initial datum @xmath120 by integrating for @xmath149 $ ] , using as initial condition .",
    "we have also used a fourth order runge - kutta , normalizing every @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 : @xmath153 we have executed our method @xmath154 and different value for @xmath115 . in our experiments , we have chosen @xmath155 .",
    "smaller @xmath156 do not improve the results , since the method is fourth - order accurate in time . with fixed boundary conditions ,",
    "the choice of @xmath124 is also not very important ; in what follows , we show the results for @xmath157 and @xmath158 , having used @xmath159 , @xmath160 . with these parameters",
    ", we have seen that smaller @xmath124 produce virtually identical results . nevertheless , for bigger @xmath115",
    ", it is convenient to use smaller @xmath124 .    to measure the quality of the results at a given @xmath117",
    ", we analyze the curvature @xmath161 .    in figure [ figure curvature l ]",
    "we show the curvature as a function of @xmath7 and @xmath117 , for @xmath157 and @xmath158 . the accuracy is lost as we approach @xmath111 , although as one would expect",
    ", the bigger @xmath115 is , the better the results are .",
    "however , it is remarkable the good accuracy with which one recovers the curvature at @xmath130 , even for small times , as we can see in figure [ figure curvature s=0 ] .",
    "again , this accuracy improves as we increase @xmath115 . finally , it is also remarkable the fact that the energy between @xmath162 $ ] , @xmath163 calculated with the trapezoidal rule , is preserved with several precision digits ( see figure [ figure error energy diffin extremos fijos ] ) .",
    "this is approximately @xmath164 for all @xmath117 .",
    "since the curvature at @xmath130 is quite well recovered and the energy well preserved , we are able to reproduce the behavior of @xmath9 correctly , at least from a qualitative point of view .",
    "indeed , in the exact solution , the energy in @xmath165 is preserved : @xmath166    this infinite energy tends to concentrate at @xmath130 , which causes the singularity to be produced .",
    "now , we are working at @xmath162 $ ] , but the finite energy is also preserved and it also tends to concentrate on @xmath130 , so we can approximate the formation of the singularity at @xmath111 . moreover , by increasing @xmath115 , we are able to recover @xmath167 for smaller times , improving the quality of the results .",

    "the reason for this is that the new boundary conditions allow us to introduce energy into the system , as time evolves , which concentrates in order to form a cusp at the origin @xmath169 .    here",
    ", the choice of @xmath124 is much more delicate . for small @xmath117 and , specially , for big @xmath115 , we have problems of aliasing , since the boundary conditions are highly oscillatory . in figure",

    "when giving the boundary conditions at @xmath116 , it is impossible to do it exactly and we will always be introducing some perturbations ; when , for instance , we fix @xmath88 to be constant at @xmath116 , these perturbations will be quite big . even if we calculated the exact value of @xmath16 , @xmath9 or @xmath105 at @xmath116 , there would always be a tiny error attributable to machine precision .",
