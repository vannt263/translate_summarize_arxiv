    "profiles of x - ray emitting hot gas in clusters of galaxies have been studied often by using the so - called @xmath0-model , which is an isothermal hydrostatic gas model consisting of a core and envelope . from the @xmath0-model analyses of 121 clusters including nearby clusters ( @xcite ) , ota and mitsuda ( 2002 ) obtained an interesting result that the distribution of the core radii of the intracluster gas exhibits two distinct peaks at @xmath3  kpc and @xmath4  kpc for @xmath5 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "akahori and masai ( 2005 ) ( hereafter am05 ) investigated correlations of the core radii with various properties of the clusters , and found that the radii in the larger core group around the peak @xmath4  kpc are marginally proportional to the virial radii of the clusters and therefore the origin may be attributed to simple self - similar collapse . on the other hand , in the smaller core group around @xmath3  kpc , no clear correlation is found between the core and virial radii , suggesting some other origin of the small core formation .",
    "am05 investigated several possibilities of the origin of the small cores , not only by examining correlations among the observational quantities but by simulating the @xmath0-model with a hydrodynamics code .",
    "many of the small core clusters possess central cd s or giant ellipticals , but the simulation shows that the gas core under their presence is @xmath6  kpc at most , and is too small to account for the observed range @xmath680  kpc .",
    "am05 suggested another possibility : the effects of radiative cooling on the core size .",
    "radiative cooling time is shorter in the core than in the ambient region , because the density is higher . as the core cools , the ambient gas then could inflow to compensate the pressure loss inside .",
    "although the asca , chandra and xmm - newton observations ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) suggested much smaller amount of cooled mass than expected for the classical cooling flow model ( see @xcite for a review ) , this process increases the gas density toward the cluster center and is likely responsible for the small cores observed .",
    "am05 found that the central cooling time , @xmath7 , is significantly shorter than the hubble time for 48 out of 50 small core clusters .",
    "thermal evolution of clusters has been studied by many authors .",
    "most of the papers addressed processes that would slow or inhibit the onset of radiative cooling instability , such as electron conduction and activities of active galactic nuclei . until an elapsed time compareble to @xmath7",
    ", however , the gas appears to be cooling rather slowly with the temperature @xmath8 kev at the cluster center .",
    "for example , ruszkowski and begelman ( 2002 ) studied the heating , conduction , and minimum temperature in cooling flows with a simple spherical model and showed that line and free - free cooling in the cluster center leads to slow cooling until the initial central cooling time has elapsed . at this stage feedback",
    "is not yet very important .",
    "masai and kitayama ( 2004 ) showed that when the intracluster gas is cooling with quasi - hydrostatic balancing , the temperature of the cooling gas appears to approach a constant value toward the cluster center .    in the present paper",
    ", we investigate thermal evolution of clusters , paying attention to the core radius of the intracluster gas undergoing radiative cooling .",
    "our interest is the origin of the small cores or the observed core - size distribution which exhibits two distinct peaks .",
    "we simulate cooling clusters using a hydrodynamics code ( am05 ) , and analyze the core radii applying the @xmath0-model , on which the observed results are based . in section 2",
    "we describe the model . in section 3 , we present the results of calculations and discuss the properties of the cooling cores .",
    "we give some concluding remarks in section 4 .",
    "we calculate the evolution of radiatively cooling intracluster gas which is initially in hydrostatic balance under the presence of dark matter .",
    "we analyze the resultant clusters using the @xmath0-model in the same manner as the observations ( ota , mitsuda 2002 ) : the core - radius distribution having two distinct peaks was obtained by analyses using the @xmath0-model .",
    "since the @xmath0-model is based originally on the king model of the collisionless matter ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , we apply primarily the king model for the dark matter and galaxies of a cluster .",
    "we also mention the results in the case of the nfw dark matter model ( navarro et al .",
    "1996 ) , because such a cuspy profile has been suggested for dark halo mergers or cluster formation by numerical simulations . as for the thermal evolution of the intracluster gas ,",
    "the two dark matter models show the similar results to each other . in the following we describe our models and calculations along the king dark matter model .    with the gravitational potential @xmath9 of the total mass within radius @xmath10 ,",

    "it is interesting that even the small core peak is produced by the clusters of @xmath94 , i.e. moderately cooled clusters that are keeping quasi - hydrostatic balance .",
    "( 77mm,54mm)figure4.eps    in the observed distribution of figure  [ fig:4 ] one may notice four clusters which have very small cores .",
    "it is unlikely that such small cores as @xmath95  kpc are reproduced by radiative cooling within @xmath96 .",
    "our cooling function underestimates by @xmath6  % at @xmath97  kev compared with the function of sutherland and dopita ( 1993 ) .",
    "if applied their original function , the small core peak might have a tail toward the small core end .",
    "however , this is unlikely because such a very small core is quite transient ( figure  [ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "this may be related with the fact that clusters of @xmath98 are out of quasi - hydrostatic balance .",
    "another possible explanation of the very small cores is the presence of central gravitational source ; the four clusters evidently have central cd s or giant ellipticals .",
    "the presence of such galaxies is likely responsible for the very small cores ( see am05 ) .",
    "the lack of clusters of core radii @xmath99  kpc is seen in the calculated distribution as well .",
    "although the outer cores of @xmath8  100300  kpc of simulated clusters can explain the population around the peak of the observed large core clusters , the latter exhibits larger core tail extended to @xmath100  1  mpc .",
    "if we simulate clusters which have initial huge cores @xmath101  mpc , we might get the cooled cores of @xmath102  kpc following the self - similarity ( see below )",
    ". however , if such huge core clusters are in hydrostatic equilibria as represented by the @xmath0-model , the clusters would have unlikely virial radii as large as @xmath103  mpc .",
    "in fact , most of the huge core clusters deviate from the self - similar relation , as shown in figure  5 of am05 .",
    "a considerable factor for the origin of such huge cores is mergers .",
    "when merger takes place , the gas could form a large flat core with a steep envelope ( large @xmath0 ) .",
    "actually , in am05 sample , 6 out of 7 clusters of @xmath104 have cores of @xmath105  mpc , and the average of @xmath0 in the 17 clusters ( including 14 irregulars ) of @xmath106  mpc is 0.98 , which is significantly greater than the average 0.65 in 121 clusters .    we find in figure  [ fig:3 ] that the single @xmath0-model represents the intermediate profile between the inner and outer profiles of the double @xmath0-model . if cooling is minor and the self - similarity remains , the profile would be represented by the single @xmath0-model of a large core . with cooling the core , but yet minor in the outer , the profile is being that represented better but transiently by the double @xmath0-model , and eventually comes to that represented by the single @xmath0-model of a small core . as a result , the core - size distribution exhibits two distinct peaks along the thermal evolution .",
    "two distinct peaks are not seen for the cluster sample of redshift between 0.4 and 1.3 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the reason may be that their analysis was done with the single @xmath0-model ; otherwise , the cooling might be yet minor in such very distant clusters .",
    "we confirm that two distinct peaks do not appear if applied the single @xmath0-model to the simulated clusters .",
    "the estimation of the inner core radius depends on @xmath86 obtained from the outer slope . if @xmath86 is taken to be 10  % smaller than that in the present calculations , the resultant clusters might have 10  % smaller cooling cores , as expected from the @xmath0@xmath24 correlation described in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",

    "we also investigate clusters of the nfw dust profile ( navarro et al .",
    "1996 ) , where the parameters of the nfw profile are determined so that the clusters have nearly the same initial density and temperature profiles of the gas , and analyze the core sizes in the same manner as above .",

    "we try to approximate the evolution of inner - core radii with a parameter , @xmath108 , and the normalized time , @xmath109 , as @xmath110 figure [ fig:6 ] shows that equation  ( [ eq:7 ] ) can represent the inner - core evolution , i.e. thermal evolution of the small core can be described by the self - similar relation , normalized by @xmath7 and @xmath111 which are obtained from the initial outer component .",
    "this self - similarity may be seen also in the clusters having different initial central densities , because in the @xmath0-model the central density determines the amplitude of the profile while the flat - core region clearly exists ; the core radius is related mainly to the envelope slope ( see figure  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "( 77mm,54mm)figure6.eps    such a self - similarity is , however , likely lost in the observed small cores . at the initial state , the inner - core size can be represented by the outer - core size , as @xmath112 where @xmath113 is obtained from figure  [ fig:3 ] . while the thermal evolution is predominant in the inner component , outer core is roughly constant , i.e. @xmath114 , so that @xmath115 is written with equations  ( [ eq:7 ] ) and ( [ eq:8 ] ) as @xmath116 from equations ( 10 ) and ( 11 ) in am05 , the initial central cooling time is given by @xmath117 therefore , equation ( [ eq:9 ] ) is written as @xmath118 for the clusters with @xmath119 ( am05 ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq:11 ] ) suggests that the self - similar relation in the small cores may be lost for not only the different age of the cluster from the last major merger , i.e. the time when the cluster formed to the current size and down to the hydrostatic equilibrium , which is labeled by @xmath120 , but the various values of @xmath0 from @xmath121 to @xmath122 in observed clusters as mentioned in am05 .",
    "calculations show that the cooling gas approximately keeps the hydrostatic balance between the gravitational force and pressure gradient at each step until @xmath123 ( figure  [ fig:7 ] ) .",
    "we compare our result with quasi - hydrostatic cooling discussed by masai and kitayama ( 2004 ) .",
    "they suggest that @xmath124 at every @xmath10 or @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the continuity equation , @xmath127 and @xmath128 are the mass of a uniform gas sphere and the cooling time for the local values at radius @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig:8 ] , our calculation shows @xmath129 is nearly constant . until @xmath130 , constant @xmath131 is seen commonly for all the model clusters , not only the king case but also the nfw case .",

    "when the cluster center cools rapidly at @xmath145 ( figure  [ fig:5 ] ) , the balance breaks because a large amount of inflow is required to maintain the balance .",

    "the properties of the cooling gas in our calculations , such as the mass inflow rate , radius dependence of the local cooling time and constant @xmath131 , are consistent with this model in the regime where quasi - hydrostatic structure is attained .",
    "we find that the inflow velocity of the gas decreases toward the cluster center , and its mass flow rate is about @xmath162 at 20  kpc .",
    "quasi - hydrostatic condition is marginally satisfied up to @xmath163 , and then the cluster center cools rapidly . regarding the relation with the core - size distribution , it may be an important clue for understanding thermal properties of clusters that even the small core peak is produced by clusters of @xmath94 , in other words , by clusters that are still keeping quasi - hydrostatic balance .    analyzing the simulated clusters with the single and double @xmath0-models , we demonstrate the core size distribution exhibits two distinct peaks at @xmath2300  kpc and at @xmath164100  kpc with a valley at @xmath99  kpc until @xmath7 and is in fairly good agreement with the observed distribution ( ota and mitsuda 2002 ; akahori and masai 2005 ) .",

    "<S> it is found that the core - size distribution thus obtained shows two peaks @xmath1100  kpc and @xmath2300  kpc and marginally can reproduce the observed distribution which exhibits two distinct peaks around @xmath3  kpc and @xmath4  kpc . </S>",
    "<S> this result may suggest radiative - cooling origin for small cores , while cooling is yet insignificant in the clusters of large cores . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that the small core peak is reproduced by clusters that are still keeping quasi - hydrostatic balance before the initial central cooling time has elapsed . </S>"
