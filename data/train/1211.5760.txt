    "quantum states populating open chaotic cavities decay to the outside environment and , thence , have the status of resonances . in spite of the ubiquity of the general setup",
    " open quantum chaos is realized in many of the devices currently explored in mesoscopic physics , quantum optics , and cold atom physics  salient features of these resonances are not fully understood . while the deep quantum regime ( the ehrenfest time , @xmath0 , marking the diffractive disintegration of minimal wave packages shorter than classical escape times , @xmath1 ) appears to be under reasonable control  @xcite , it is the opposite , semiclassical limit which poses unsettled issues  @xcite .    broadly speaking , the states populating an open cavity can be grouped into two families : states evolving near classically and escaping deterministically after a classical flight time , and a fraction @xmath2 of quantum resonances , whose probabilistic decay is characterized by a finite imaginary offset @xmath3 to the real resonance energy @xmath4 . the most basic quantity characterizing the statistics of resonances of complex energy @xmath5 is the resonance density @xmath6 .",
    "although the quantitative profile of that quantity is not fully understood , the density appears to be gapped against the real axis , @xmath7 ( the existence of rare midgap states notwithstanding  @xcite . )",
    "the integrated number of resonances at a given value of @xmath4 has been found to obey the so - called fractal weyl law , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a non - universal fractal exponent .",
    "previous work on the phenomenon includes the formulation of lower bounds on the resonance gap  @xcite , semiclassical approaches based on short periodic orbits _ trapped _ in the open system",
    "@xcite , a description in terms of non - unitarily evolving husimi functions  @xcite , phenomenology based on a mixture of phase space dynamics and random matrix theory , resp .",
    "@xcite , and numerical analyses  @xcite . however , a unified theory of resonance formation in terms of first principle semiclassical dynamics appears to be missing and the formulation of such a theory is the subject of the present work .",
    "specifically , we will explore the quantum dynamics of states concentrated on classical trajectories in terms of phase space wigner functions .",
    "assuming globally hyperbolic classical dynamics we will describe how quantum fluctuations operational on long trajectories convert the deterministic classical escape of short trajectories into probabilistic quantum decay .",
    "our analysis is organized in three conceptual steps .",
    "we first introduce the phase space language used in the rest of the paper on a one - dimensional toy model ( section  [ sec1 ] ) .",
    "we then generalize to the more complex setting of a higher dimensional cavity ( section  [ sec2 ] ) , and derive effective boundary conditions determining the decay rates of the system .",
    "finally , ( section  [ sec3 ] ) we analyze these equations for both short and long trajectories .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : summary ] .",

    ", will be motivated shortly . with this choice ,",
    "the boundary conditions obtained by matching wave functions and their derivatives at the left and right interface reduce to the single algebraic equation , @xmath26    before evaluating this equation , let us translate from the language of wave functions to a phase - space formulation . to this end",
    ", we introduce the wigner function @xmath27 , where @xmath28 . for our specific system , @xmath29",
    "where , @xmath30 labels the wigner transform of the left and right moving components , resp . , and",
    "the ellipses denote rapidly oscillating interference contributions . in discarding the latter , we loose track of the global phase of the wave function , while the information on amplitudes and phase _ derivatives _ necessary to evaluate boundary conditions is retained .",
    "indeed , it is straightforward to check that @xmath31 for the simple @xmath32 system , the linear dependence @xmath33 implies @xmath34 so that reduces to @xmath35 where we have fixed a gauge @xmath36 for the arbitrary phase of the wave function and neglected contributions @xmath37 .    for the toy model at hand , @xmath38 , which means that the right hand side of vanishes , and @xmath39 is the only consistent solution .",

    "a similar distinction applies to the entry points .",
    "depending on the entry / exit variants , each trajectory neighboring @xmath51 gets assigned entry / exit points @xmath97 , a time like progression parameter @xmath89 , and a phase space parameterization @xmath98 .",

    " a statement to be verified below  and the same goes for the generator of weak classical corrections , @xmath132 .",
    "we may thus take the boundary condition at face value , and conclude that due to the homogeneous evolution @xmath133 , the right hand side of the equation vanishes .",
    "as with the toy model , this implies a diverging decay rate , @xmath39 . in this divergence",
    "reflects the fact that wave packages travelling on classically short trajectories leave the cavity with certainty at the exit point .",
    "we now turn to the case of long trajectories , @xmath134 . for",
    "asymptotically long trajectories , @xmath135 , the classical shrinkage @xmath136 would lead to singularities in the function @xmath137 and , ultimately , in the wigner function . within the present formalism",
    ", these singularities are regularized on time scales larger than @xmath0 , where @xmath138 has shrunk down to quantum scales . on these scales , the quantum generator @xmath131 of eq .",
    "is no longer small in comparison to the classical generator @xmath123 ( while the correction @xmath139 to the classical flow continues to be largely irrelevant . )",
    "the ensuing modifications of the dynamics can be described in various ways ( cf .",
    "@xcite for a treatment tailored to the formalism applied here ) , the invariable conclusion being that the shrinkage of classically evolving variables gets cut off by quantum fluctuations .",
    "technically , this conclusion rests on the observation that in the evolution equation for the variable @xmath94 the higher order derivatives @xmath140 present in the quantum generator , build up pressure counteracting the classical contraction .",
    "this is seen in explicit terms in the fourier / laplace representation of the evolution equation , where these derivatives assume the form of algebraic factors , cutting the logarithmic ultraviolet singularities of the classical equation . referring to the appendix for more details",
    ", we note that to leading semiclassical accuracy functions which in the classical theory evolve as @xmath141 get replaced by @xmath142 . here",
    ", @xmath143 is symbolic notation for classical ( @xmath144-independent ) functions over which we have no explicit control , and the substitution @xmath145 becomes effectual in the large negative time asymptotics of a trajectory , where @xmath93 rather than @xmath94 scales to small values .    to understand the consequences of this regularization mechanism , consider the trajectory time parameter , @xmath146 at the exit point of @xmath118 .",
    "now notice that @xmath147 , where we used that , @xmath148 .",
    "the crucial observation here is that the regularization effectively truncates the in - time function @xmath149 at values @xmath0 . as a consequence",
    ", the interface derivative @xmath150 reduces to one half of the value before quantum regularization .",
    "substitution of this value into eq .",
    "shows that the quantum theory admits finite values of the decay constant , determined by @xmath151 where @xmath42 is the lambert function and ellipses denote subleading double-`@xmath152 ' contributions .",
    "eq .   states the decay rate in terms of the ehrenfest time in combination with non - universal short time cutoff @xmath153 .",
    "however , in the semiclassical limit , @xmath154 , the dependence on @xmath4 drops out , and we are left with the asymptote @xmath155 . before commenting on this result",
    ", we note that the appearance of a finite decay rate within our present formalism follows from the fact that , by heisenberg uncertainty , quantum mechanics is not capable of resolving the phase space fine structures pertaining to the evolution of long trajectories @xmath156 .",
    "each such trajectory should , rather , be thought of as a distribution defined by the union of trajectories with uncertainty @xmath157 in their phase space coordinates . at a given instance of time , a fraction of this distribution escapes , as described by the rate @xmath158 .",
    "our above analysis was oversimplifying in that it treated escape from an isolated long trajectory , @xmath51 , as tantamount to escape into the lead vacuum .",
    "this picture ignores the fact that escaping trajectories may get folded back into the repeller domain supporting @xmath51 , and thence be trapped again .",
    "a statistical theory accounting for the renormalization of the decay of an initial distribution centered around an isolated trajectory by the complex structure of the embedding repeller structure has been developed in refs .",
    "the result of that analysis is an effective renormalization of decay rates as @xmath159 , where the factor @xmath160 effectively measures the fraction of trajectories managing to escape the repeller and @xmath161 is the fractal ( information ) dimension of the latter  @xcite .",
    "the ensuing effective rate , @xmath162 is generally identified with the inverse of the classical escape time of the system .",
    "we finally caution that the decay rate will be subject to sources of _ fluctuations _ which are beyond the scope of our analysis .",
    "notably , the lyapunov exponents may vary between trajectories , and along individual trajectories .",
    "the escape from the repeller may introduce additional uncertainty .",
    "our result , thus , yields a characteristic value for the decay rate , where the important role of fluctuations is left unaccounted for .",
    "other effects not captured by our analysis include transient features of the classical dynamics _",
    "outside _ the repeller s area which , as recent work shows  @xcite , may have important influence on the resonances of open quantum system .",
    "for completeness we note that a finite quantum mechanical decay rate is attributed to states located in the vicinity of exceptionally long trajectory . due to the exponential scarcity of these trajectories ,",
    "the corresponding phase space measure scales as  @xcite @xmath163 , where @xmath164 is the phase space volume of the energy shell ( in units @xmath144 ) , implying that @xmath165 with _ fractal _ dimension @xmath166  @xcite .",
    "we finally note that in the quantum regime , @xmath167 , which is complementary to the semiclassical regime @xmath168 studied here , random matrix scattering theory predicts  @xcite @xmath169 , where @xmath170 is some cut - off energy scale .",
    "comparison with shows that the two results match at the boundary @xmath171 .",
    "however , we can not say whether this matching is coincidental or not .",
    "we have formulated a semiclassical theory of quantum escape processes in open chaotic systems .",
    "the most important single contribution of our approach is that it quantitatively describes how deterministic escape after the traversal of generic short trajectories through the system gives way to _ quantum mechanical decay _ on long trajectories .",
    "the latter define the support of resonances whose life times we estimated by imposing effective phase space boundary conditions .",
    "somewhat counterintuitively , it turns out that the ensuing decay rates are classically short @xmath172 , although the relevant escape dynamics takes place on long trajectories @xmath134 .",
    "finally , the escape of individual long trajectories as described in the present paper defines only an initializing stage of the decay of a more complicated repeller structure . as a result ,",
    "the decay rate @xmath173 is subject to renormalization @xmath174 where @xmath161 is the fractal repeller dimension .",
    "qualitatively , the renormalization factor accounts for the probability that a state gets re - captured by the repeller structure after escaping an individual trajectory .",
    "however , a quantitative description of that secondary mechanism is beyond the scope of our approach .",

    "considering positive starting values , @xmath179 ( the extension to negative values is straightforward ) , we introduce a laplace representation @xmath180 in which takes the form  @xcite @xmath181 the general solution of this equation is found by straightforward integration over @xmath182 , and when inserted into gives @xmath183 with an integration constant @xmath184 .",
