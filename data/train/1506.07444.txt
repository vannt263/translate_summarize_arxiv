    "\\2 ) applying the results to several @xmath0-unstable and prolate deformed nuclei , we find that the ws potential can describe the ground state bands and the @xmath1 bands equally well as other potentials ( davidson , kratzer , morse ) , if the `` well size '' and the diffuseness are large enough ( at least 1.9 and 0.44 respectively ) , but it fails to describe the @xmath2 bands , apparently because of its lack of a hard core .",
    "several ( forty - four ) examples of deformed nuclei satisfying this condition have been found , but on the other hand all @xmath0-unstable nuclei considered violate this condition .",
    "\\3 ) the form of the potentials coming out from the fits exhibits a very large dip near the surface .",
    "in other words , the bohr equation forces the parameters of the ws potential to obtain values producing a very large dip near its surface , so that its overall shape around its minimum largely resembles the shape around the minimum of the davidson , or the kratzer , or the morse potential .",
    "\\4 ) the present results suggest that potentials used in the bohr hamiltonian can provide satisfactory results for nuclear spectra if they possess two features , a hard core and a deep oscillator - like minimum .",
    "they also suggest that the lack of a hard core does not decisively affect the description of the ground state and @xmath1 bands , but destroys the ability of the potential to describe @xmath2 bands .",

    "\\1 ) the quasi-@xmath2 bandheads move to higher energies ( normalized to the energy of the first excited state ) both in @xmath0-unstable and in deformed nuclei , if the left wall of the infinite well potential used in the e(5 ) and x(5 ) critical point symmetries is gradually moved to the right of the origin of the @xmath55-axis , approaching the right wall @xcite .",
    "\\2 ) the interlevel spacings within the @xmath2- band , which are known to be overestimated in the framework of the x(5 ) critical point symmetry , get fixed by allowing the right wall of the infinite well potential to be sloped to the right @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned here that the identification of a symmetry underlying the x(5 ) special solution of the bohr hamiltonian remains an open problem .",
    "analytical wave functions for the bohr hamiltonian with the ws potential can be readily obtained by exploiting the similarity of this hamiltonian , after using the pekeris approximation , to the exactly soluble extended ws potential with a dip near its surface .",
    "the calculation of b(e2 ) transition rates becomes then a straightforward task , to be addressed in further work .",
    "finally , the solution of the bohr hamiltonian with a woods  saxon potential within the framework of the algebraic collective model @xcite would offer the opportunity of comparison of the present approximate results to exact numerical solutions .",
