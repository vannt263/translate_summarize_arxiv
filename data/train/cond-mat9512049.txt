    "self - organized criticality ( soc )  @xcite is a dynamic phenomenon which occurs in certain dissipative systems with large numbers of degrees of freedom .",
    "such a system , when slowly driven into its metastable state , self - organizes in a state with long - range correlations , similar to the critical state at a second - order phase transition .    in conventional criticality ,",
    "quenched disorder can be a _",
    "relevant _ perturbation in the vicinity of the critical point .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask how the soc state responds to similar perturbations .",
    "one might expect that self - organizing systems are more robust against random perturbations , since the critical state is an attractor of the dynamics , although the universality class may change in presence of disorder .",
    "we explore this question in the present work , where we demonstrate , using numerical simulations on simple models of self - organizing cellular automata with frozen random defects , the conditions for a system to self - organize , and determine the universality class of the critical behavior .",
    "disorder - mediated phase transition between different types of metastable states are also discussed .",
    "we study three kinds of random defects which locally affect the rules of relaxation in a manner analogous to the random site , random bond , and random field defects in spin models displaying conventional critical phenomena .",
    "all these models are based on the directed abelian 2-dimensional _ critical height _ model ( toppling if @xmath0 ) which is exactly solvable in the absence of defects  @xcite , in which the dynamic rules are locally modified at a fraction @xmath1 of `` defect '' sites . in model",
    "a , holes of infinite depth are placed at random sites . in model b",
    "there are two variables @xmath2 and @xmath3 associated with each site @xmath4 .",
    "these are coupled at random sites ( details are given in section 3 below ) , in a manner so as to lead to a multiplicity of metastable states , as in the case of spin - glasses and other frustrated systems . in model c , frozen - in local slopes",
    "are introduced by preventing relaxation through the height instability at defect sites , and instead applying a critical slope toppling rule at all sites with slopes @xmath5 . in this case , regions with local slopes @xmath6 are established , while the rest of the system relaxes according to the critical height rule ( the critical height @xmath7 is chosen such that @xmath8 ) . in all three cases the ratio between the number of particles leaving one site and the number appearing at its neighbors is not uniform at defect sites .",
    "the numerical results presented here are from simulations on lattices ( with periodic boundary conditions in the transverse direction ) of size @xmath9 for time steps ( see below ) up to @xmath10 .",
    "a lattice with frozen - in defects is prepared and kept fixed for the entire number of time steps , and then a new configuration is prepared ; results are then averaged over the total number of configurations . in each case , the system was driven by randomly adding particles to sites at the top ( first row ) , @xmath11 .",
    "the dynamic height variable @xmath12 , associated with each lattice site @xmath4 on a square lattice , is updated according to the rules of the critical height model : if @xmath12 exceeds a critical value @xmath13 , then the site is unstable and relaxes according to    @xmath14    where @xmath15 are the two neighboring downstream sites .",
    "this rule applies to all sites except for a fraction @xmath1 of randomly distributed defect sites , at which infinitely deep holes are placed .",
    "thus two grains are lost each time an avalanche hits a defect , rendering the dynamic process nonconservative .",
    "( similar nonconservative models have been considered earlier @xcite ) . for @xmath16",
    "the critical exponents are listed in table  1 .",
    "an annealed version of defects of the above type was studied numerically in ref.@xcite , where it was shown that the system self - organizes into a subcritical state .",
    "the probability distributions of duration @xmath17 and size @xmath18 were found to fulfill the following scaling forms    @xmath19    where the correlation lengths @xmath20 and @xmath21 for time and spatial correlations , respectively , diverge in the limit @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24  @xcite .",

    "there are no recurrences in the avalanche dynamics and thus both annealed and quenched ( frozen ) impurities lead to the same universal scaling properties . in fig .",

    "for finite concentration of defects @xmath1 , the curve flattens , and the scaling region with slope @xmath30 decreases with increasing @xmath1 , corresponding to the decreasing correlation length in the system . at a critical concentration @xmath31 , the directed - percolation threshold  @xcite , it is no longer possible to have a lattice spanning cluster  @xcite .    for sandpiles without defects ,",
    "the fluxes into and out of the lattice are equal the distribution @xmath32 of the current which flows over the rim of the system is shown in fig .  2 for @xmath33 and various systems sizes @xmath34 .",
    "as expected for a self - organized critical state , the outflow current distribution exhibits scale invariance  @xcite , _ i.e. _    @xmath35    [ fig2 ]    the finite - size scaling fit , also shown in fig .  2 has the exponents @xmath36 and @xmath37 . with defects ,",

    "in order to simulate effects of random bonds in a sandpile automaton , we introduce a two - state variable @xmath40 at each lattice site @xmath4 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are not necessarily integer .",
    "each bond carries a quenched variable @xmath43 with value @xmath44 : the disorder here is that a random fraction @xmath1 of the bonds have @xmath45 .",
    "the evolution rule for model b depends on the absolute value of the difference between components @xmath41 and @xmath42 at a site , which causes instability if it exceeds a critical value @xmath46 .",

    "we find the best fit for @xmath59 and @xmath60 . in this model",

    "it appears that the exponents are independent of the concentration of defect bonds @xmath1 , suggesting universal criticality .",
    "similar robustness is exhibited by the system for variations in @xmath66 , provided that @xmath66 is strictly smaller than one : namely , all curves for @xmath67 coincide with the open circle curves in fig .",
