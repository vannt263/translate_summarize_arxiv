    "neutron scattering in the kev to mev energy range is one of the most important processes in many fields , for which better understanding of nuclear reaction mechanisms is always crucial . in particular , accurate neutron reaction cross sections are needed for applications such as radiation transport simulations for nuclear technology , particle detector response , nuclear reaction rate calculation for nuclear astrophysics , and so forth . when we calculate the nuclear reaction cross section for a system where the dynamical or static nuclear deformation is involved , the simple regime of the spherical optical model plus the hauser - feshbach theory @xcite has to be extended to the coupled - channels scheme ( e.g. ref .",
    "rotational bands built on intrinsic or vibrational levels dominate the low - lying excitation spectra for statically deformed nuclei , and it is well known that these excited rotational states are strongly populated by the collective motion of target nucleus .    typically , the direct reaction channels in the statistical model have been considered in a perturbed way , in which a flux going into the direct channels is subtracted from the total compound nucleus formation cross section @xcite , i.e. , the direct and compound cross sections are assumed to be independent .",
    "such approximation has a great advantage to reduce computational burden , and therefore , many hauser - feshbach codes , such as empire @xcite , talys @xcite , ccone @xcite , coh@xmath3 @xcite , etc . , employ this approximation to calculate nuclear reaction cross sections .",
    "however , it was shown that the existence of direct reaction channels changes the compound reaction cross sections @xcite .",
    "therefore it is important to assess the independence of the direct and compound reaction mechanisms quantitatively , which exists implicitly in the approximation aforementioned .    statistical models for the compound nuclear reaction connect energy average @xmath0-matrix elements ( or transmission coefficients ) to energy average cross sections .",
    "while the statistical hauser - feshbach theory provides such a link , it has to be modified by the width fluctuation correction that accounts for statistical properties in the resonances .",
    "the width fluctuation correction enhances the cross section in the elastic channel , and reduces all other channels to fulfill the unitarity condition .",
    "when strongly coupled channels exist , the energy average @xmath0-matrix , @xmath4 , is no - longer diagonal .",
    "the imposed unitarity condition yields additional correlations between the elastic and other channels , hence the cross sections will be further modified @xcite .",
    "kawai , kerman , and mcvoy ( kkm ) @xcite obtained a formula for the compound nuclear reaction including the direct channels at the strong absorption limit .",
    "the actual calculations of kkm are , unfortunately , very limited @xcite . in parallel to kkm , inclusion of the direct reaction in the statistical theory was proposed by engelbrecht and weidenmller @xcite , in which @xmath4 is diagonalized by a unitary transformation .",
    "the statistical model calculation is performed in the diagonalized space , just like the no - direct reaction cases .",
    "hofmann et al .",
    "@xcite and moldauer @xcite performed the engelbrecht - weidenmller ( ew ) transformation to examine the effects of the direct channels on the compound nuclear reaction .",
    "a more general and rigorous theory was proposed by nishioka , weidenmller , and yoshida ( nwy ) @xcite based on the so - called gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) @xcite together with the ew transformation",
    ". however , the nwy equation obtained is almost impossible to calculate .",
    "the most recent study on this subject is by capote et al .",
    "@xcite , who studied the impact of the ew transformation on a realistic calculation of inelastic scattering on @xmath2u using the coupled - channels optical model code ecis @xcite .",
    "an enhancement of the inelastic scattering cross section was found @xcite , yet the compound reaction model implemented in ecis is limited and further investigation was needed .    in the case of a spherical nucleus",
    ", we obtained a simple relationship between the channel degree - of - freedom @xmath1 and the optical model transmission coefficients @xmath5 by applying the monte carlo technique to goe @xcite , which yields an almost equivalent compound nucleus cross sections to the goe three - fold integration formula @xcite .",
    "such an empirical approach facilitates computations of the hauser - feshbach theory in the fast energy range , where the number of open channels tends to be too large to handle . starting with the approach by moldauer @xcite , and adding the idea of goe three - fold integration , we extend moldauer s approach to the actual cross section calculation for deformed nuclei .",
    "since we will show in this paper that our model produces almost identical results to the nwy theory , the calculated nuclear reaction cross sections should be within reasonable uncertainties for many realistic cases . this could be particularly important to calculate nuclear reaction cross sections for actinides or in the rare earth region , where the static nuclear deformation is large .",
    "# 1      in the case of nuclear reaction without direct channels , the hauser - feshbach theory with the width fluctuation correction reads @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the energy average cross section from channel @xmath8 to @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the hauser - feshbach cross section , @xmath11 is the wave - number of projectile , @xmath12 is the width fluctuation correction factor , and @xmath13 is the transmission coefficient in channel @xmath14 calculated with the optical model @xmath0-matrix element @xmath15 . hereafter we omit the kinematic factor of @xmath16 , unless otherwise specified .",
    "the width fluctuation correction factor is given by the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) model of verbaarschot , weidenmller , and zirnbauer @xcite .",
    "this model gives an ensemble average of the fluctuation part , @xmath17 , and the width fluctuation correction factor can be calculated as a ratio to @xmath10 .",
    "the so - called goe triple - integral formula is @xcite    @xmath18    where @xmath19    the compound cross section is readily calculated as @xmath20 when @xmath21 is provided , beside the time - consuming three - fold integration @xcite .",
    "the goe model is believed to be a correct answer to the calculation of the compound cross section .",
    "however , it is not so practical to apply eq .",
    "( [ eq : goe3int ] ) to realistic cases .",
    "for example , a compound nucleus after a particle or photon emission is often left in the continuum state , where the decay channel is not well defined . even if we approximate the transition to one of the continuum bins by a pseudo - single level , the calculation time will be enormous when there are many open channels .",
    "alternatively , there are several models to evaluate @xmath12 .",
    "we adopt moldauer s model @xcite , since hilaire , lagrange , and koning @xcite reported that this model is practically accurate enough .",
    "the width fluctuation correction factor can be evaluated numerically as @xmath22 where @xmath1 is the channel degree - of - freedom , which is related to the channel transmission coefficient @xmath5 .",
    "there are , again , several models to express @xmath1 by @xmath5 , which were derived by a monte carlo study , such as that of moldauer @xcite , ernebjerg and herman @xcite , or of lanl @xcite .",
    "we here employ the most recent model from lanl @xcite , because it produces almost identical @xmath12 compared to the goe triple - integral calculation @xcite .      when direct reaction channels exist , in other words , the optical model @xmath0-matrix is not diagonal , the hauser - feshbach cross section in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hf ] ) should be further modified . in this case",
    "the energy average @xmath0-matrix is given by the coupled - channels calculation .",
    "when combining the coupled - channels method with the hauser - feshbach theory , the existing cross section calculation codes , such as empire @xcite , talys @xcite , ccone @xcite , and coh@xmath3 @xcite , adopt a `` direct cross section eliminated '' transmission coefficient .",
    "this is defined as the probability of formation of compound nucleus on the @xmath23-th state by a nucleon having the orbital angular momentum and spin of @xmath24 : @xmath25 where the suffix @xmath14 indicates the quantum number in the channel , @xmath26 is the total spin and parity , and @xmath27 is the spin factor @xmath28 @xmath29 is the spin of the nucleus state .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : modtrans ] ) gives a partial - wave contribution to the total compound formation cross section when the target is in its @xmath23-th state @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the intrinsic spin of incoming particle . because we eliminate the off - diagonal elements in @xmath21 by eq .",
    "( [ eq : modtrans ] ) , the meaning of the transmission coefficient is different from the no - direct reaction case .",
    "we call this a _ generalized transmission coefficient . _",
    "the statistical model calculation is performed in the direct cross section eliminated space , assuming the channels are diagonal .",
    "such assumption implies that the direct and compound cross sections are independent , and the unitarity condition is fulfilled only for the total reaction cross section .",
    "therefore the scattering cross sections are given by an incoherent sum of the direct and compound components .",
    "for example , the inelastic scattering cross section is written as @xmath32 where the direct cross section @xmath33 is usually given by the coupled - channels calculation , and we denote the generalized transmission coefficients by @xmath34 . often another approximation is made in addition to eq .",
    "( [ eq : modtrans ] ) , which consists in replacing the decay channel transmission coefficients @xmath35 by the ground state @xmath36 calculated at a shifted energy , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the excitation energy of @xmath23-th level .",
    "this is not the case in our study . making use of the time - reversal property of @xmath0-matrix ,",
    "the transmission coefficients for each @xmath23-th state can be calculated automatically by eq .",
    "( [ eq : modtrans ] ) .",
    "note that the impact of this approximation is small when the optical potential depends weakly on the incident energy .",
    "a rigorous treatment of off - diagonal elements in @xmath21 is to perform the engelbrecht - weidenmller ( ew ) transformation @xcite .",
    "the particle penetration is expressed in terms of satchler s transmission matrix @xcite @xmath39 where the @xmath0-matrix elements @xmath40 are usually given by the coupled - channels calculation .",
    "since @xmath41 is hermitian , this can be diagonalized by a unitary transformation @xcite @xmath42 and the same matrix @xmath43 diagonalizes the scattering matrix , i.e. , @xmath44 we use greek subscripts for channel indices in the diagonalized space , and latin subscripts for the normal space .",
    "since @xmath45 is diagonal , a new transmission coefficient in the diagonal channel space is defined as @xmath46 and the statistical model calculation is performed in the diagonal channel space to evaluate the fluctuating part @xmath47 . finally a back - transformation from the channel space to the cross - section space reads @xmath48    nishioka , weidenmller , and yoshida ( nwy ) @xcite obtained an equivalent formula for the fluctuation cross section , which expressed in terms of the non - diagonal @xmath21 .",
    "although nwy does not require the @xmath41-matrix diagonalization , a hefty computational burden is still involved . instead of calculating nwy",
    ", we follow the procedure given above : the ew transformation is applied to non - diagonal @xmath21 , and the goe triple - integral of eq .",
    "( [ eq : goe3int ] ) is applied to the diagonalized channel space .",
    "this is the most accurate procedure to calculate the cross sections when @xmath21 is not diagonal , and we consider this is the reference goe cross section , as this is equivalent to nwy .",
    "based on this , we further develop a technique , which is feasible in realistic cross section calculation cases , yet yields practically the same results to the reference goe .",
    "we follow moldauer s prescription @xcite , in which the engelbrecht - weidenmller ( ew ) transformation @xcite is invoked , although an approximation  the decay amplitudes are normally distributed and their real and imaginary parts are uncorrelated  was made to cross sections in the diagonalized space .",
    "the back - transformation can be re - written as @xcite , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a width fluctuation corrected cross section in the diagonalized channel space , @xmath51    replacing the energy average ( angle - bracket ) by the ensemble average ( overline ) , the goe triple - integral formula gives a new term of @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : backtrans2 ] ) by setting @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "moldauer @xcite estimated this in terms of the channel degree - of - freedom @xmath1 and the width fluctuation corrected cross section @xmath50 as @xmath55 this estimation was partially confirmed by a goe monte carlo study @xcite , when @xmath56 is real .",

    "this requires an extra phase factor as @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "actual cross section calculations involve many uncoupled or very weakly coupled states , such as the neutron emission to the continuum , the photon emission in the neutron radiative capture process , and nuclear fission . in the generalized transmission calculation scheme , inclusion of these channels is straightforward ; the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hfmodt ] ) , @xmath61 , includes the transmission coefficients for all uncoupled channels .",
    "the particle emission transmission coefficients may be given by the optical model , the photon channel is calculated with the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) model , etc .",
    "in the case of ew transformation , the penetration matrix may have two blocks @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the coupled channels @xmath41 matrix , and @xmath64 is the diagonal part that accounts for decaying into the uncoupled states .",
    "the unitary transformation is performed to @xmath63 only , and the summation in the denominator of @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : channelsig ] ) runs over both the eigenvalues of @xmath63 and the diagonal elements of @xmath64 .",
    "finally the uncoupled cross section is calculated by @xmath65      the aim of this paper is twofold ; ( a ) understanding the limitation of generalized transmission coefficient in eq .",

    "( [ eq : sab2 ] ) will be . to this end",

    "nevertheless a general tendency can be clearly seen ; when the generalized transmission coefficient is used , the elastic channel is overestimated and the inelastic channel is underestimated .",
    "the impact of ew transformation is large , when there are a few channels open ( e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : modtrans ] ( a ) ) , and the direct cross sections are large . under such circumstances the approximated method to calculate the cross section by employing the generalized transmission coefficients leads to incorrect answers .",
    "the underestimation in the inelastic channels decreases as the number of channels @xmath66 increases .",

    "figure  [ fig : modtranslimit ] shows the inelastic channel underestimation as a function of the elastic enhancement",
    ". the underestimation will be very small at the strong absorption limit ( @xmath92 ) , where the width fluctuation correction to the inelastic channels fades out due to a large number of open channels .",
    "in other words , the ew transformation is essential when the elastic enhancement largely changes the inelastic channels .     +   +      to investigate the uncoupled channel in the ew transformation , we construct @xmath0 with @xmath93 as in @xmath94 where the channel @xmath14 is uncoupled to the channels @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",

    "[ fig : modtrans_uncoupled ] . as opposed to the coupled inelastic scattering channel , the cross section to the uncoupled channel increases very slightly , but is almost not influenced by the channel coupling .",
    "this suggests , in the case of neutron - induced reactions on deformed nuclei , that the inelastic scattering cross sections will be enhanced mainly at the expense of the elastic channel , while the neutron capture and fission cross sections will practically not change .      because the term of @xmath95 in eq .",

    "<S> the ensemble average of @xmath0-matrix elements in the diagonalized channel space is approximated by a model of moldauer [ phys.rev.c * 12 * , 744 ( 1975 ) ] using newly parametrized channel degree - of - freedom @xmath1 to better describe the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) reference calculations . </S>",
    "<S> moldauer approximation is confirmed by a monte carlo study using randomly generated @xmath0-matrix , as well as the goe three - fold integration formula . </S>",
    "<S> the method proposed is applied to the @xmath2u(n , n ) cross section calculation in the fast energy range , showing an enhancement in the inelastic scattering cross sections . </S>"
