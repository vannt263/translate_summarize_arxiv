    "cherenkov telescope system revealed dozens of the new very - high - energy ( vhe ) @xmath4-ray sources  @xcite .",
    "many of them have no counterparts in other wave - lengths , thus called `` unidentified ( unid ) tev sources '' .",
    "today , about 40 such unidentified tev sources are known on the galactic plane  @xcite .",
    "most of them are located within a height of @xmath5 1 degree from the galactic plane , and some are intrinsically extended . despite a large number of intensive studies in the last several years , their origin is unclear @xcite .",
    "x - ray follow - up observations of the unid tev sources are now on - going . although supernova remnants ( snrs ) or hypernova remnants were suggested to be major counterpart candidates of these tev unid sources @xcite , only a few sources have been actually identified as snrs . on the other hand , rather surprisingly , several unid tev sources have been identified as pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) .",
    "they seem to be rather old , previously unknown pwne , compared to the pwne already identified and well studied in x - rays .",
    "the first hess observations of the region around psr j18091917 were made from may through june 2004 as part of the systematic survey of the inner galaxy @xcite . because marginal vhe @xmath4-ray signals were detected ,",
    "hess j1809193 was observed again in 2004 and 2005 , and significant @xmath4-ray emission was confirmed  . recent study of this source by hess was reported by @xcite .",
    "fitting the excess map with a 2-d symmetric gaussian , the best fit position and intrinsic source extension ( in rms ) were determined as ( ra , dec ) = ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "psr j18091917 is a radio pulsar discovered by the parkes multibeam pulsar survey  @xcite .",
    "the pulsar is located at the position of ( ra , dec ) = ( , ) with a pulse period of @xmath9  ms and the period derivative of @xmath10  s  s@xmath11 .",
    "the distance to the source was estimated to be @xmath12  kpc from the pulsar s dispersion measure using the ne2001 galactic electron - density model  @xcite .",
    "the characteristic age and the spin - down luminosity are @xmath13  kyr and @xmath14  ergs  s@xmath11 , respectively .    the @xmath4-ray spectral analysis performed by @xcite indicated that the spectral slope is different between the regions near the pulsar and far from the pulsar .",
    "this is the second case that spatial variation of the spectral slope is revealed in the vhe @xmath4-ray emission .",
    "the first case is hess j1825137  , which is largely extended in both vhe @xmath4-ray and x - ray bands  @xcite .",
    "asca observation revealed diffuse , non - thermal emission in the vicinity of psr j18091917  @xcite .",
    "@xcite detected a bright point x - ray source which was positionally consistent with the pulsar psr j1809@xmath01917 , and resolved the surrounding compact pwn utilizing the very high angular resolution of chandra .",
    "the pwn has a `` head - tail '' profile , consisting of the southern - head , which is coincident to the pulsar , and the northern - tail .",
    "@xcite claimed that this cometary morphology is attributed to a bow shock created by the pulsar moving supersonically to the southern direction .",
    "however , it is still unknown whether the faint diffuse emission discovered by asca is related to the pwn or not . in this paper",
    ", we make detailed analysis of the diffuse emission for the first time using suzaku .",
    "suzaku , characterized by the low detector background compared to chandra and xmm - newton , is very suitable for the analysis of faint and diffuse x - ray emission such as hess 1809193 .",
    "( 80mm,80 mm ) fig / hessj1809_3.eps    we observed hess j1809193 with suzaku @xcite in april , 2008 .",
    "suzaku is equipped with two types of instruments : the x - ray imaging spectrometers ( xis :  @xcite ) at the foci of four x - ray telescopes ( xrt :  @xcite ) and the hard x - ray detector ( hxd :  @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the observation was carried out with two pointings at north and south of the source region ( figure [ fig:1809:hessj1809 ] ) in order to cover the pulsar and extended vhe @xmath4-ray emission along the direction of the elongated shape of the pwn @xcite .",
    "three xiss ( xis 0 , 1 , 3 ) out of four were operated in the normal clocking mode with the spaced - row charge injection ( sci )  @xcite .",
    "we analyzed the data processed by the version 2.2 pipeline .",
    "we are interested in the spatial variations of a scale of arcminutes .",
    "hence , we concentrated on the analysis of the xis data in this paper , since the hxd does not have a spatial resolution within a field of view of @xmath1530  arcmin .",
    "we applied the standard screening criteria to the xis data to obtain the cleaned event lists .",

    "the pulsar is the brightest in the fov , and the western edge of the fov is also significantly bright , which was already hinted by asca @xcite .",
    "we have determined extension of the diffuse emission as follows : we created a 1-dimensional profile of the surface brightness from the rectangle region shown in figure  [ fig:1809:img reg - hess ] ( left ) which runs from north to south .",
    "we selected the direction which enabled us to create the longest profile .",
    "we did not take a symmetric region around the pulsar , because the faint and diffuse emission is significantly asymmetric .",
    "although there is a point source in the south of the pulsar at ( 272.42 , @xmath019.43 ) , its flux in the integrated region is only 1 % of the central pulsar , thus negligible .",
    "the 1-dimensional profile thus created is shown in figure  [ fig:1809:img reg - hess ] ( right ) .",
    "note that the surface brightness is normalized to the peak brightness .",
    "we fitted the profile with a gaussian function plus a constant to evaluate its extension . in the fitting , we ignored the brightest part around the pulsar with a width of @xmath20 ( corresponding to the point - spread function of the xrt ) .",

    "the gaussian center was found to be offset by @xmath22 from the pulsar and the rms width to be @xmath23 .",
    "we studied spatial variation of the x - ray energy spectra of the diffuse emission .",
    "we generated the detector response file and an auxiliary response file using xisrmfgen , and xissimarfgen @xcite and performed model fitting using xspec version 12.4.0 .",
    "first we examined energy spectrum from an outskirt of the hess source region ( the red rectangular region in figure  [ fig:1809:img reg - hess ] ) in order to estimate contribution of the galactic ridge x - ray emission ( grxe ) on this particular area .",
    "the bright source at the south - east corner ( circled in red ) was excluded in this analysis .",
    "we subtracted the non x - ray background ( nxb ) estimated using xisnxbgen ( detail of the method described in @xcite ) , and averaged all of the available xiss ( xis 0,1,3 ) data . because the nxb becomes high above 7.2  kev ( in particular for xis1 which has the back - illuminated chip ) , we used the data only below 7.2  kev .",
    "we fitted the spectra in 4.07.2 kev and 2.04.0  kev separately following the reproduction procedure of grxe in @xcite .",

    "using suzaku , we have clearly shown presence of the large scale diffuse emission around hess  j1809193 , which was already suggested by asca @xcite .",
    "the extension of the diffuse emission is at least @xmath79 ( @xmath80 of the gaussian approximation ) .",
    "the diffuse spectrum has the photon index of @xmath31.7 , which is much harder than those of snrs with synchrotron x - ray emitting shells ( @xmath323 ) , such as sn  1006 , rx  j17133946 , and others ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) .",
    "such a hard spectrum , on the other hand , reminds us the pwn origin @xcite .",
    "this hypothesis is , in fact , strengthened by the very existence of the pulsar psr  j1809@xmath01917 .",
    "the tev emission also may have the pwn origin , because it positionally coincides with the region including the pulsar and the diffuse x - ray emission , although the center of the tev emission is offset by @xmath81 ( a projected distance of 6  pc at 3.5  kpc ) from the pulsar .",
    "if both the tev and x - ray emissions are from the same pwn , their origin is accelerated electrons via inverse compton ( tev ) and synchrotron mechanisms ( x - ray ) .",
    "typical energies of responsible electrons are @xmath1520  tev for the tev emission and @xmath1580  tev for x - rays , respectively .",
    "the former has much longer synchrotron life timescales than latter ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) .",
    "if we assume that the electrons which emit tev gamma - rays have the same age as the pulsar ( @xmath8251  kyr ) and those for the x - rays are very fresh , the positional offset may be explained by the proper motion of the pulsar . to explain",
    "the offset of @xmath81 , the transverse velocity of the pulsar needs to be @xmath15120  km  s@xmath11 , which can be explained with the average transverse velocity of radio pulsars ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath83  km  s@xmath11 ) . * on the other hand , the tails seen in the _ chandra _ image ( if it is indeed a tail not a jet ) suggests that the pulsar is moving southward and its velocity vector is at the angle of @xmath15190200  deg . east of north @xcite .",
    "now if we assume that the pulsar was born at the center of the tev source and moved to its current position , its velocity vector would have to be at the angle of 1020  deg .",
    "west of north .",
    "therefore , the angle between these two velocity vectors will be @xmath15140160  deg .",
    ", which makes this scenario unlikely .",
    "* another possible scenario to make such an offset is collision between the reverse shock and the pwn @xcite like the case for vela  x @xcite .    in the young pwne , it is suggested that the x - ray spectra become softer with the distance from the pulsars due to synchrotron energy loss of the accelerated electrons ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) .",
    "however , we could not find any hint of such softening ( figure  [ fig:1809:phoindex grid ] ) .",
    "this means that electrons do not lose significant energies via the synchrotron emission .",
    "the x - ray size of hess  j1809193 is @xmath79 ( @xmath84 ) , or 21  pc with the assumed distance of 3.5  kpc .",

    "we have a similar case , hess  j1825137 , which is another unid tev source with possible pwn origin .",
    "@xcite found that the x - ray photon index is nearly constant over the emission region , which may suggest hess  j1825137 also might have small turbulence of the magnetic field .",
    "therefore , we suppose fast transportations of accelerated electrons may be rather common phenomena in old pwne . further similar samples of unid tev sources may confirm this hypothesis .",

    "the extended emission has very hard nonthermal spectrum with the photon index of @xmath151.7 .",
    "no systematic spatial variation of the photon index is found , which implies that accelerated electrons do not lose their energy when they run from the pulsar to the edge of the emission region .",

    "<S> suzaku observed the region including hess  j1809@xmath0193 , one of the tev unidentified ( unid ) sources , and confirmed existence of the extended hard x - ray emission previously reported by asca , as well as hard x - ray emission from the pulsar psr  j1809@xmath01917 in the region . </S>",
    "<S> one - dimensional profile of the diffuse emission is represented with a gaussian model with the best - fit @xmath1 of @xmath2 arcmin . </S>",
    "<S> the diffuse emission extends for at least 21  pc ( at the 3@xmath1 level , assuming the distance of 3.5  kpc ) , and has a hard spectrum with the photon index of @xmath31.7 . </S>",
    "<S> the hard spectrum suggests the pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) origin , which is also strengthened by the hard x - ray emission from psr  j1809@xmath01917 itself . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to the low background of suzaku xis , we were able to investigate spatial variation of the energy spectrum , but no systematic spectral change in the extended emission is found . </S>",
    "<S> these results imply that the x - ray emitting pulasr wind electrons can travel up to 21  pc from the pulsar without noticable energy loss via synchrotron emission . </S>"
