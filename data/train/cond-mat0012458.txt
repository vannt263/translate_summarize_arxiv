    "realization of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) in atomic gases  @xcite has stimulated explosively growing interest in several subfields of physics . with unprecedented controllability in creating , manipulating , and probing systems , many previously  gedanken \"",

    "another characteristic feature of gaseous bec systems is their good isolation from the surrounding environment , as the system is suspended in a vacuum chamber by a magnetic or an optical trapping potential . when the potential is axisymmetric , the projected angular momentum ( am ) on the symmetry axis is conserved and can take on any integral multiple of @xmath6 .",
    "in contrast , in bulk superfluid systems , the container plays the role of a highly dissipative environment so that the system can sustain am only at thermodynamically stable values , resulting in the quantization of circulation . in this respect ,",
    "gaseous bec systems are more like nuclear systems than bulk superfluid systems , and it is of interest to study the energy spectrum of a weakly interacting bec system as a function of am , namely the yrast spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the lowest - energy state of an isolated system subject to a given am , @xmath1 , is called the yrast state  @xcite . when the system is in the yrast state ,",

    "this allows one to measure fine energy levels the yrast spectrum close to the ground state .",
    "recently , the yrast state has been extensively discussed in the context of gaseous bec systems  @xcite .",
    "mottelson has pointed out that for repulsive contact interactions the yrast spectrum is dominated by quasi - degenerate quadrupole and octupole excitations  @xcite , and kavoulakis _ et al _ have shown that the interaction between octupole excitations makes the excitation energy of this mode slightly higher than that of the quadrupole mode  @xcite .",
    "bertsch and papenbrock  @xcite have found numerically that for @xmath7 , the energy of the yrast state is given by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the frequency of the confining potential , @xmath4 the strength of the interaction , and @xmath0 the number of bosons , which we shall assume to be constant .",
    "the corresponding eigenstate has been shown to exist in refs .",

    ", we present an operator - algebraic approach  @xcite to analytically deriving these results in a systematic way , demonstrating that the interaction energy between octupole excitations is given by @xmath11 , where the coefficient 27/34 agrees precisely with the numerically obtained value  @xcite .",
