    "the ratio @xmath85/@xmath79 = 33.3 ( @xmath86 1 ) places our tlni@xmath0se@xmath0 single crystal in the clean limit .",

    "since all three compounds have the same crystal structure and similar electronic structure , @xcite their common `` @xmath7''-shape field dependence of @xmath6 may have the same origin  the multiple nodeless gaps .",
    "we note that the normalized @xmath6 has been numerically simulated for two band @xmath9-wave state with unequal gap sizes , which successfully explained the experimental data of ba(fe@xmath10co@xmath11)@xmath0as@xmath0 with different co - doping by systematically varying the ratio @xmath77/@xmath78 .",
    "@xcite however , this kind of calculation can not reproduce the pronounced `` @xmath7''-shape @xmath6 curve in fig .",

    "in summary , we have measured the thermal conductivity of tlni@xmath0se@xmath0 single crystals down to 50 mk .",

    "<S> low - temperature thermal conductivity measurements were performed on single crystals of tlni@xmath0se@xmath0 , a nickel - chalcogenide heavy - electron superconductor with @xmath1 @xmath2 3.7 k. in zero field , the residual electronic contribution at @xmath3 @xmath4 0 k ( @xmath5 ) was well separated from the total thermal conductivity , which is less than 0.45% of its normal - state value . such a tiny residual @xmath5 is unlikely contributed by the nodal quasiparticles . </S>",
    "<S> nodeless gap structure is supported by the very weak field dependence of @xmath6 in low magnetic fields . in the whole field range , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 exhibits an `` @xmath7''-shape curve , as in the case of nickel pnictides bani@xmath0as@xmath0 and srni@xmath0p@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this common feature of nickel - based superconductors can be explained by multiple nodeless superconducting gaps . </S>"
