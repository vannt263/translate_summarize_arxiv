    "the study of modifications of the theory of general relativity has been of interest ever since einstein first formulated general relativity in 1915 .",
    "particularly interesting are modifications that introduce terms to the einstein - hilbert action that are second order in the curvature , as such modifications represent high - energy corrections to the einstein - hilbert action that might arise in quantum gravity .",
    "chern - simons gravity is an example of such a second - order modification of the einstein - hilbert action .",
    "chern - simons modifications to gravity were first considered in 2 + 1 dimensions @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the structure of these theories in 3 + 1 dimensions and showed how they could arise as a low - energy consequence of string theory .",
    "@xcite considered some early - universe implications of such theories . refs .",
    "@xcite investigated how chern - simons terms might participate in leptogenesis .",
    "@xcite renewed the investigation of chern - simons gravity , working out the linearized equations of the theory and their implications for gravitational waves .",
    "most recently , refs .",
    "@xcite solved the linearized chern - simons field equations around a collection of spinning point masses .",
    "in much of the work on chern - simons gravity , the chern - simons term is coupled to a scalar field ( as detailed below ) , and this scalar field is assumed to be spatially homogeneous but time varying .",
    "this assumption can be motivated by arguments analogous to those that have been made suggesting that the quintessence field should be coupled to the chern - simons term of electromagnetism @xcite .",
    "chern - simons gravity has thus far eluded constraints from solar system tests of weak - field gravity because it is indistinguishable from general relativity for all spacetimes that possess a maximally symmetric two - dimensional subspace and for all conformally flat spacetimes @xcite .",
    "therefore , the schwarzschild spacetime as well as the robertson - walker spacetime are also solutions of the chern - simons gravitational field equations .",
    "distinguishing chern - simons gravity from general relativity requires considerations of spacetimes that are not spherically symmetric , such as the spacetime around a spinning body . to this end ,",
    "@xcite investigated the chern - simons modifications to the motion of bodies around a spinning point mass and found that the motion was indistinguishable from that in general relativity .    in this paper",
    "we take further steps to link chern - simons gravity to current and forthcoming experimental tests of weak - field gravity .",
    "we assume , as in other recent work , that the scalar field coupled to the chern - simons term is time varying but spatially homogeneous .",
    "we then determine the spacetime around an extended spinning mass and find that it differs from the spacetime around a spinning point mass .",
    "we determine the orbits of test particles and the precession of gyroscopes moving in this spacetime and find that the chern - simons modification does lead to observable deviations from the predictions of general relativity .",
    "these deviations allow us to evaluate constraints to the chern - simons parameter space from current satellite experiments , as well as those regions to be probed with forthcoming experiments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii defines the theory and derives the gravitational field equations .",
    "section iii considers the linear theory and derives the gravitomagnetic equations of motion ( the chern - simons ampre s law ) .",
    "section iv discusses the solution for the gravitomagnetic field around a spinning massive body . in section",
    "v , we consider the orbital precession of test bodies in this spacetime , as well as the orbital precession of gyroscopes , and we determine the regions of the chern - simons - gravity parameter space that are probed with the lageos and gravity probe b satellites .",
    "we conclude briefly in section vi .",
    "appendix a shows how the chern - simons lagrangian we work with may be derived from a string - theory action , and appendix b outlines the derivation of the gravitomagnetic vector potential around a spinning sphere .",

    "@xcite notes that if @xmath14 is a non - dynamical field ( a lagrange multiplier ) , the theory can not accommodate a spacetime with a nonzero @xmath6 because the cotton - york tensor would have a non - zero divergence . however , if @xmath14 is a dynamical field , then the theory can indeed accommodate spacetimes with nonzero @xmath6 since we have @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the stress - energy tensor for @xmath14 .",

    "the stress - energy tensor for @xmath34 is diagonal , so it does not contribute to the time - space field equations .",
    "let @xmath35 be a unit vector in the coordinate time direction , and then define the 4-vector potential of this linearized theory , @xmath36 we consider a source with mass density @xmath37 , mass current @xmath38 and negligible pressure , so we can express the matter stress - energy tensor as @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "in general relativity , the time - space components of the linearized field equations take the form @xmath41 which is ( nearly ) identical to maxwell s equations for the vector potential in lorenz gauge ( @xmath42 ) .",

    "the classically ` physical ' fields ( i.e. , those that enter into the geodesic equation ) @xmath46 and @xmath47 are given by @xmath48 where we have defined @xmath49 .",
    "two of the maxwell equations , @xmath50 are a direct consequence of the way in which the @xmath46 and @xmath47 fields are defined in terms of the vector potential , and so these two equations will be the same in chern - simons gravity .",
    "gauss law , which follows from the time - time component of the field equation , is now @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the energy density of the scalar field @xmath34 and is uniform throughout the solar system . since @xmath52 can not be larger than the mean cosmological energy density , it must be negligible compared to the density of the source @xmath37 , and we do not consider it further .",
    "the only significant modification will be to ampre s law , which , for chern - simons gravity , is now given by @xmath53 where we have defined @xmath54 .",
    "given the metric perturbation represented by the gravitomagnetic potential and neglecting the time variation of the metric , slowly moving particles travel on geodesics such that a ` lorentz force law ' of the form , @xmath55 is obtained .",
    "therefore , as in electrodynamics , only the physical fields , and not the potentials , have physical relevance .",
    "we furthermore note that @xmath6 can be expressed in terms of gravito - electric and gravitomagnetic fields as @xmath56 unlike the case with maxwell fields @xcite , it is not sufficient for the fields to have a non - vanishing @xmath57 in order to have a non - trivial coupling between gravity and the scalar field .",
    "the best example of a gravitational source which produces a non - vanishing @xmath6 is a spinning , spherical body .",
    "we are now in a position to calculate the gravitomagnetic field in chern - simons gravity for a spinning body .",

    "we see that the chern - simons terms alter the components of the gravitomagnetic field along the rotation axis @xmath59 and @xmath73 , and they also introduce a new component perpendicular to the plane defined by @xmath59 and @xmath74 . in other words , while in general relativity a toroidal mass current implies a poloidal gravitomagnetic field , the parity violation introduced in chern - simons gravity introduces a toroidal component to the gravitomagnetic field .",
    "something similar occurs in chern - simons electromagnetism @xcite , although the detailed fields differ since the @xmath75 term in eq .",

    "( [ amp ] ) that as @xmath77 , the general - relativistic solution should be recovered .",
    "this occurs since the oscillatory terms vanish as @xmath77 , and so the effects on geodesics of these new terms will vanish .",

    ", one can not find a coordinate transformation that causes both @xmath82 and @xmath83 to vanish .",
    "this is at odds with claims ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) that a metric for stationary axisymmetric spacetimes in chern - simons gravity can always be found with @xmath84 . in general relativity , one can always find a coordinate system for which @xmath85 for a stationary axisymmetric spacetime sourced by rotating perfect fluid . however , the proof of this statement assumes time - reversal invariance of the fundamental equations .",
    "this invariance implies that the metric components possess the same symmetries as the source , namely invariance under a transformation that takes @xmath86 and @xmath87 . in that case",
    ", @xmath88 and @xmath83 must be zero to keep the line element invariant under the same transformation . in chern - simons gravity ,",
    "time - reversal invariance is explicitly broken by the rolling of the scalar field , @xmath89 , and it is straightforward to verify that our solution for @xmath62 , given in appendix b , implies that @xmath88 and @xmath90 are both odd under time reversal .",
    "consequently , the line element has the same symmetry as the source even though @xmath88 and @xmath90 are nonzero .    inspection of our solution for the vector potential given in appendix b shows that it differs from the solution for a point - like mass - current dipole ( i.e. , a gravitomagnetic dipole ) obtained by alexander and yunes ( ay ) @xcite . when applied to a single spinning source , the metric given by refs .",

    "( [ amp ] ) outside of a spinning sphere , and we can see that every term in @xmath92 also appears in our solution for @xmath62 .",
    "the additional oscillatory terms in our solution constitute a homogeneous solution to eq .",
    "( [ amp ] ) , but without these terms , @xmath62 would not be continuous across the surface of the sphere .",
    "furthermore , only these oscillating terms contribute to @xmath93 because @xmath94 . the inclusion of oscillatory terms results in a chern - simons gravitomagnetic field that differs from general relativity , so we may use observations of the motion of test bodies in the earth s gravitomagnetic field to constrain chern - simons gravity .",
    "in order to investigate how the chern - simons gravitomagnetic field will affect the motion of test particles around the earth , we will use what are known as the gaussian perturbation equations @xcite .",
    "details of how these equations are applied to gravitomagnetic forces are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ; here we give only a brief introduction .",
    "the gaussian perturbation equations give the time variation of the keplerian orbital elements in the presence of a perturbing force . in our case",
    "we take the gravitomagnetic force , @xmath95 , as a small perturbing force and approximately solve the equations given in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we will concentrate on analyzing the secular ( non - periodic ) time variation of the longitude of the ascending node reference plane as it is moving upwards ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . ] , @xmath96 , but note that other keplerian elements will also vary due to the terms introduced by chern - simons gravity .",
    "the time variation of @xmath96 has been well studied since , in general relativity , it is connected with the lense - thirring drag @xcite , @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the magnitude of the angular momentum of the central body , @xmath99 is the semi - major axis of the orbit of the test body , and @xmath100 is the orbit s eccentricity .",
    "finally , in order to evaluate the secular perturbations , we approximate the orbit of the test body as circular ( i.e. , @xmath101 , a good approximation for current measurements ) , and we average the perturbing force over one orbital period to obtain @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the precession due to @xmath93 . the total precession is @xmath104 .",
    "we note that @xmath103 is an even function of @xmath63 .",
    "recent measurements of laser ranging data to the lageos i and lageos ii satellites have measured @xmath105 to within 10% of its value in general relativity @xcite . requiring that the chern - simons contribution does not exceed 10% of the general relativity result , we find that we can place a lower limit to the chern - simons mass , @xmath106 , as shown in fig .",

    "the earth s gravitomagnetic field will also cause a precession of gyroscopes moving in the spacetime .",
    "a gyroscope will undergo precession due to two torques .",
    "one is known as the geodetic precession and is independent of the earth s gravitomagnetic field .",
    "the other torque is due to a coupling to the gravitomagnetic field and results in a rate of change of the spin of a gyroscope given by @xcite @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the angular momentum of the gyroscope .",
    "nasa s gravity probe b ( gpb ) mission is currently attempting to measure this gyroscopic precession @xcite .",
    "gpb consists of a satellite , in a polar orbit at an altitude of about 640 km , that contains four drag - free gyroscopes and a telescope .",
    "the gyroscopes are initially oriented such that their spins are aligned parallel to the optical axis of the telescope , which is pointing within the plane of the orbit .",
    "the telescope points towards a guide star , allowing a measurement of the precession of the direction of the spins of the gyroscopes .",
    "geodetic precession results in an annual precession in the north - south direction of about 6600 milliarcseconds ( mas ) whereas the general relativistic gravitomagnetic field causes an annual east - west precession of around 42 mas @xcite .    with the chern - simons expression for the gravitomagnetic field , given in eq .",
    "( [ bfullcs ] ) , it is straightforward to calculate the resulting gyroscopic precession for a polar orbit ( applicable to gpb ) .",

    "it was initially projected that gpb would achieve a percent - level measurement of the gravitomagnetic contribution to @xmath113 . however , since its launch in 2004 , it has encountered several unexpected complications that will degrade the precision of the tests of gravity @xcite , although the extent of the degradation has yet to be reported . in fig .",

    "( [ gpb_ratio ] ) for a gpb detection of the gravitomagnetic precession to within 10% of its value in general relativity .",
    "we have idealized the earth to be a sphere of constant density throughout this work , when in reality , it is an oblate spheriod with layers that have different mean densities .",
    "however , we expect that the non - spherical corrections would affect both the general relativity and chern - simons calculations similarly and , to the accuracy we require , are negligible when we consider the ratio between general relativity and chern - simons results . furthermore , it is easy to generalize our results to spheres with layered density profiles because @xmath47 depends linearly on @xmath37 .",
    "we replaced our model of a homogeneous earth with a model of the core and mantle and we found that the amplitudes of the oscillations in @xmath103 and @xmath112 were not affected . we conclude that our constraints on @xmath63 are not sensitive to the details of the density profile of the earth .",
    "the addition of a chern - simons term to the action for gravity is of interest as it may arise as a low - energy limit of string theory .",
    "the theory and formalism of this modification of gravity have been worked out in a number of previous papers , and some of the early - universe consequences of such a term have been investigated .",
    "however , there has been little work on tests of such modifications in the present universe .    in this paper , we have calculated the linear - theory spacetime around a spinning massive body , finding new corrections that were overlooked in previous work .",
    "the gravitomagnetic field in chern - simons gravity differs from that in general relativity in two ways : ( 1 ) there is an oscillating component , and ( 2 ) there is a toroidal component to the gravitomagnetic field that arises as a consequence of the parity - breaking nature of the theory and that has no counterpart in ordinary general relativity .",
    "we then determined the precession of orbits of test particles in this spacetime and also of gyroscopes moving in this spacetime .",

    "we then use multipole expansions for the green s function , @xmath172 where @xmath173 and @xmath72 are , respectively , spherical bessel function of the first and second kind , @xmath174 is a spherical harmonic , and the subscript @xmath175 ( @xmath176 ) means the argument is the lesser ( greater ) of @xmath60 or @xmath177 .",
    "the solution for @xmath62 is then obtained by integrating , @xmath178 where all vectors are expanded in a cartesian basis",
    ".    the resulting expression for @xmath62 may be split into a general - relativistic and a chern - simons term , @xmath179 , where @xmath180 , \\ & r          \\leq r , \\\\          \\frac{r^2}{5r^2 } , \\",

    "we note that this solution for @xmath62 is finite at the origin and continuous across the boundary of the sphere , so it produces a finite @xmath47 at the origin and a continuous metric . taking the curl of this solution for @xmath62 yields the expressions for @xmath47 given in section [ sec : bfield ] .",
    "thus far , we have not discussed any boundary conditions on the gravitomagnetic field @xmath47 at the surface of the sphere .",
    "the field equations for @xmath47 imply two such boundary conditions , and we will now prove that the continuity of @xmath62 guarantees that these two boundary conditions are satisfied .",
    "the first boundary condition follows from @xmath184 ; as in electromagnetism , this condition implies that the component of @xmath47 that is perpendicular to the surface must be continuous .",
    "the second boundary condition follows from the chern - simons version of ampre s law : @xmath185 integrating this equation over a surface with vanishing area that is perpendicular to the surface of the sphere and contains the boundary implies that the components of @xmath186 $ ] that are parallel to the sphere s surface must be continuous across the boundary .",
    "generally , the continuity of @xmath62 would not imply continuity of its curl .",
    "however , our @xmath62 is a solution to eq .",
    "( [ eq : cool ! ] ) , which may be rewritten as @xmath187 since @xmath62 and @xmath188 are both continuous across the surface of the sphere , this equation implies that @xmath47 is also continuous across the surface of the sphere .",
    "furthermore , taking the curl of this equation shows that @xmath189 is continuous provided that @xmath76 and @xmath190 are continuous . taking the curl of eq .",
    "( [ afullgr ] ) confirms that @xmath190 is continuous across the surface of the sphere .",
    "therefore , we have shown that the continuity of @xmath62 implies that both @xmath47 and @xmath189 are also continuous , which guarantees that both boundary conditions on @xmath47 are satisfied by our solution .",
