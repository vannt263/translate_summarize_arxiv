    ", this categorification was considered to be essentially unique , since the underlying @xmath2 tqft was known to be determined by its frobenius system and all rank two frobenius systems were fully classified @xcite . however , in @xcite ozsvath , rasmussen and szabo came up with a new categorification of the jones polynomial , which agrees with khovanov s one after reducing the coefficients modulo two .",
    "the underlying algebraic structure of the odd khovanov homology can not be described in terms of the frobenius algebra .",
    "this fact attracts attention again to the question of description and classification of algebraic structures leading to link homology theories . in this paper",
    ", we provide an evidence to the fact that the appropriate algebraic structure is given by an extended quantum field theory ( eqft ) .",
    "a eqft here is a 2functor from a certain ( semistrict ) monoidal 2category of cobordisms , called an _ extension _ , to an abelian category .",
    "given a cobordism category by specifying its generators and relations , the 2category is constructed by requiring the relations to be satisfied up to 2isomorphisms .",
    "furthermore , such a 2category is called an extension of the original cobordism category , if the automorphism group of any 1morphism is trivial .",
    "a simple example of an extension is a @xmath1extension , where the 2morphisms are just plus or minus the identity .",
    "notice that extensions can be defined for both strict and semistrict monoidal 2categories and the resulting eqft will also be called strict and semistrict respectively .",
    "the usage of the word `` extension '' in our setting is motivated by the fact that after replacing the original category by a group we will get a usual extension of that group .",
    "those extensions are classified by the second cohomology classes of the group .",
    "therefore , our approach can serve as a definition for the second cohomology of a category . a quite different notion of an extended topological field theory ( etft )",
    "was introduced and studied in @xcite .    in this paper , we construct extensions of the category of 2dimensional cobordisms @xmath3 and of the category of embedded 2cobordisms modulo the unknotting relation @xmath4 . in the first case , we recover the khovanov and the odd khovanov homologies , as strict ( trivial ) and semistrict extensions respectively . in the second case",
    ", we construct so  called nested khovanov homology , extracted by stroppel and webster @xcite from the algebraic counterpart of the seidel ",
    "smith construction .",
    "in addition , we show that the last theory is equivalent to those of khovanov . more precisely , for a given diagram @xmath5 , let us denote by @xmath6 its khovanov hypercube of resolutions .",

    "smith conjecture .",

    "[ main1 ] any strict eqft based on a @xmath1extension of @xmath4 , which agrees with khovanov s tqft after reducing the coefficients modulo 2 , gives rises to a link invariant homology theory isomorphic to those of khovanov .",
    "a challenging open problem is to classify all semistrict eqfts based on @xmath4 , which associate to a circle a rank two module . more generally , the problem is to compute the second cohomology of @xmath4 and construct cocycles restricting to the schur cocycle of the symmetric group .",
    "an interesting algebraic system underlying the categorification of the kauffman skein module @xcite , @xcite was proposed recently by carter and saito @xcite .",
