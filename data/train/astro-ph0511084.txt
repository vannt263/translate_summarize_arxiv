    "the sample of nearby , radio - quiet , isolated neutron stars discovered by _ rosat _ ( for a review , e.g. , @xcite ) is of particular interest because of the unambiguous presence of strong , broad absorption features in the x - ray spectra of most sources .",
    "since the spectra appear thermal , these features almost certainly arise in the neutron - star atmospheres .",
    "the features have usually been interpreted under the assumption of a pure hydrogen composition ( not unlikely , given the short settling times for neutron stars ) and a strong magnetic field ( as suggested by the long , 310  s spin periods ; @xcite ) , with the absorption reflecting either the proton cyclotron line or transitions between bound states of neutral hydrogen ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in order to help determine the nature of the absorption features , as well as to elucidate what sets the isolated neutron stars apart from young rotation - powered pulsars ,",
    "we have started a program to obtain phase - connected timing solutions , and use these to estimate ages and magnetic field strengths .",

    "rx  j1308.6 + 2127  ( also known as rbs  1223  and 1rxs  j130848.6 + 212708 ) was identified as a possible nearby isolated neutron star by @xcite .",

    "finally , we used the ` axbary ` program to barycenter all of the events ( using the x - ray position : @xmath11 , @xmath12 ; @xcite )    for the _ xmm - newton _  data , we used the standard procedures ` emchain ` and ` epchain ` ( ` xmmsas ` version 6.5.0 ) to reprocess the observations .",
    "next , we extracted events within 375 of the source position ( using standard quality and pattern selections ) with energies from 0.12  kev to 1.2  kev , and used ` barycen ` to convert the arrival times to the solar - system barycenter . and finally , for the _ rosat _  hri data , we extracted the events within @xmath13 of the source .",
    "we barycentered these using the ` ftools ` programs ` abc ` and ` bct ` , and converted the event times from coordinated universal time ( utc ) to barycentric dynamical time ( tdb ) using the corrections supplied in @xcite .",
    "our goal is to use times - of - arrival ( toas ) to infer a phase - coherent timing solution in which each cycle of the source is accounted for . to measure toas , we need an initial reference period .",

    ", we constructed binned light curves ( with 16 phase bins ) for all of the observations . unlike rx  j0720.4@xmath23125 , rx  j1308.6 + 2127has non - sinusoidal pulsations and",
    "hence determining toas by fitting a single sinusoid would be inappropriate .",
    "instead we fit for both the first harmonic and fundamental , with a possible phase shift between them : @xmath17+c , \\label{eqn : fitfh}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the number of counts in bin @xmath19 , @xmath20  hz is the frequency of the fundamental from above , @xmath21 the time of bin @xmath19 on the interval @xmath22 , and the parameters are amplitude @xmath23 , phase @xmath24 , amplitude ratio @xmath25 , phase offset @xmath26 , and constant offset @xmath27 .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : pn ] , this model provides a good fit to even the highest - quality lightcurves , which are those derived from the long epic - pn observations . the inferred phase offset and relative amplitude are similar for both observations , with @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .    assuming that the pulse profile is not varying , we measured arrival times for all of the data using the above model , but with @xmath30 and @xmath25 fixed at 0.03 and 2.8 , respectively , which generally provides a good fit to the light curves ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pn ] for the epic - pn data ) .",
    "our resulting arrival times are listed in table  [ tab : obs ] . here , we assigned these times to the time of the maximum of the model lightcurve that follows the lowest minimum and is nearest to the middle of the observation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pn ] ; this is the spectrally harder maximum from @xcite ) . for completeness , we note that the toas derived using the above model are consistent with those one would find using a simpler model consisting of only the first harmonic ( i.e. , a sinusoid at @xmath31  s ) : the mean absolute difference is @xmath32 .",
    "we determined a timing solution from the toas using an iterative procedure , as in @xcite .",
    "we started with the _ chandra _  acis cc toas and found that we were able to fit these without the need for a frequency derivative and with no cycle ambiguity , consistent with the power spectrum analysis .",
    "however , between the first acis cc toa and the preceding toa ( _",
    "chandra _  hrc ) there is a gap of 320  days and we found that a constant - frequency model led to a poor fit ( @xmath33 for 7 degrees of freedom ) . including a frequency derivative @xmath34 , the cycle count over the gap became ambiguous by @xmath35 cycle .",
    "the three possibilities2683550 , 2683551 , and 2683552 cycles  lead to three possible solutions for @xmath34 : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "fortunately , the addition of the remaining data eliminates the first two of those solutions : with the _ xmm - newton _  toas ( and the remaining acis point ) , they have @xmath39 and 1107.6 with toa rms of 0.041  s and 0.099  s , respectively , while the third has @xmath40 with a toa rms of 0.010  s ( all for 14 degrees of freedom ) .    the timing solution derived from the _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  toas is presented in table  [ tab : ephem ] .",
    "as indicated by the value of @xmath41 , the data are well reproduced by simple spin - down ; the addition of a cubic ( @xmath42 ) term leads to only an insignificant reduction in @xmath41 , from 18.7 to 18.6 , and the inferred value of @xmath43 is consistent with zero .",

    "if we include it in the fit , the overall solution does not change drastically ( @xmath34 becomes @xmath59 ) and the deviation does decrease to @xmath60  cycles , but the overall @xmath41 increases to @xmath61 for 15 degrees of freedom ( with a toa rms of 0.0271  s )",
    ". the deviation could be intrinsic ( a glitch , timing noise , precession , changes in pulse profile ) , but might also be instrumental , perhaps related to differences in energy responses between the different instruments .",
    "unfortunately , the sampling is too sparse to determine a unique solution . as an example , we show in figure  [ fig : resid ] a cubic fit that matches the hri point reasonably well , with @xmath62 for 14 degrees of freedom , toa rms of 0.011  s , and @xmath63 .",
    "we stress , however , that , in essence , this solution approximates the _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  data with a @xmath64 model and then adjusts @xmath65 to pass through the hri point .",
    "hence , it does not gives much additional insight .",
    "the spin period and spin - down rate we derive for rx  j1308.6 + 2127  are quite similar to those of rx  j0720.4@xmath23125 , the only other isolated neutron star with a timing solution @xcite , placing both of them above the pulsar `` death - line '' in a @xmath49-@xmath50 diagram despite their lack of radio emission @xcite .",
    "hence , assuming both spin down by magnetic dipole radiation , rx  j1308.6 + 2127  and rx  j0720.4@xmath23125  have similar inferred magnetic field strengths ( @xmath66 and @xmath67  g , respectively ) , characteristic ages ( @xmath68 and 1.9  myr ) , and spin - down luminosities ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) .",
    "both sources also have thermal x - ray spectra with temperatures of @xmath71k , but superposed on these are rather different absorption features : in rx  j1308.6 + 2127 , the absorption feature is centered near or below 300  ev and is very wide and strong , with an equivalent width of @xmath72  ev @xcite ; in rx  j0720.4@xmath23125 , on the other hand , no absorption was apparent until 2004 , when an absorption feature with only a slightly higher energy but much smaller equivalent width ( @xmath73  ev ) appeared @xcite . if the magnetic fields , line energies , and blackbody temperatures are all similar , what would account for the significant difference in line strength ?",
    "the interpretation of the absorption lines is still a matter of debate . for rx",
    "j1308.6 + 2127 , @xcite suggested proton cyclotron absorption in a field of ( 26)@xmath74  g , which could match both the energy and strength of the observed feature ( for a gravitational redshift of @xmath75 , the observed line energy would be at 100300  ev ) .",
    "as the feature in rx  j0720.4@xmath23125  was so much weaker but at a similar energy , @xcite argued that for that source the proton cyclotron line was below the observed band and that the absorption was due to the @xmath76 transition between tightly - bound states of neutral hydrogen in a @xmath77  g field .",
    "qualitatively , the field strengths inferred from our timing measurements agree with the above expectations : the field of rx  j1308.6 + 2127  is stronger than that of rx  j0720.4@xmath23125 , while a weaker field would be expected if the absorption in both sources were due to the same mechanism .",
    "quantitatively , a larger difference between the two sources was expected . however",
    ", this discrepancy may simply reflect orientation and/or substructure in the magnetic field  higher - order multipoles near the surface would affect the emission properties but not the spin - down rate .",
    "such effects may also be responsible for the difference in pulse profile : double - peaked for rx  j1308.6 + 2127 , and sinusoidal for rx  j0720.4@xmath23125 .",
    "phase - resolved x - ray spectroscopy coupled with observations of more sources are probably the best ways to disentangle these effects , and efforts are underway ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "another open issue is that the characteristic ages of rx  j0720.4@xmath23125  and now rx  j1308.6 + 2127  are three to four times larger than the values of @xmath78  myr one would expect for simple cooling models @xcite and , in the case of rx  j0720.4@xmath23125 , tracing the object back along its trajectory to a likely birth location ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , this age discrepancy may extend to the other isolated neutron stars discovered by _",
    "rosat _ : all have similar temperatures and thus likely similar cooling ages , and most also have similar periods ( 310  s ) and , based on the similar energies at which they show x - ray absorption features ( 0.30.7 kev ) , similar magnetic field strengths , implying similar characteristic ages .",
    "we first consider whether the discrepancy could result from the characteristic age being an overestimate . in general , for a spin - down torque @xmath79 , the pulsar s spin - down age is given by @xmath80\\left[1-\\left(p_0/p\\right)^{n-1}\\right]$ ] , where @xmath81 is the initial spin period and @xmath82 is the `` braking index , '' equal to 3 under the assumption of magnetic dipole radiation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for @xmath83 and @xmath84 , one recovers the characteristic age @xmath85 , but if @xmath81 is not much smaller than the current period  @xmath49 , the characteristic age is an overestimate .",
    "while we can not exclude the required birth periods of 78  s , there is as yet no concrete indication that neutron stars are born with periods longer than 100  ms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ".    for rx  j0720.4@xmath23125 , this led us to discuss the possibility that the neutron star formed in a binary system and accreted matter before being ejected in a second supernova ; at ejection , the neutron star would still be hot from the accretion , but spinning slowly @xcite .",
    "a variation on this model would involve accretion from a residual debris disk such as that recently discovered around the anomalous x - ray pulsar 4u  0142 + 61 @xcite , but this assumes that the accretion disk persists for a sufficient time and can affect the spin - down of the neutron stars , both of which are far from clear . in either case , if accretion played a role , it might explain why the spectral properties of the isolated neutron stars are rather different from those of the radio pulsar population .",
    "unfortunately , the above solution for the age discrepancy is not unique .",
    "first , it is possible that the spin - down was not due to a constant dipole but that the magnetic field decayed ( effectively , this implies @xmath86 ) .",
    "second , the cooling age could be incorrect due to non - standard cooling .",
    "for instance , the energy released by magnetic field decay might keep a neutron star hotter ( @xcite ; note , however , that these authors do not expect significant effects for the field strengths we infer ) and longer cooling times are also expected for a light neutron star @xcite .",
    "a prolonged cooling timescale seems somewhat unlikely in light of the kinematic age estimates , though it should be kept in mind that these may also not be unique : for rx  j0720.4@xmath23125 , several different birth places are possible @xcite .",
    "finally , when fitted with just a simple spin - down model , rx  j0720.4@xmath23125  showed significant timing residuals of 0.31  s ( root - mean - square ) , much larger than the uncertainties on the toas .",
    "in contrast , for rx  j1308.6 + 2127  the root - mean - square residuals are only 0.010  s ( excluding the hri point ) , consistent with measurement errors . since the sources were observed with the same instruments , and have similar spectral shapes , the differences in timing behaviors are likely not instrumental .",
    "instead , they may well reflect the fact that both the spectrum and pulse profile of rx  j0720.4@xmath23125  are varying with time @xcite , while rx  j1308.6 + 2127  appears to be stable ."
