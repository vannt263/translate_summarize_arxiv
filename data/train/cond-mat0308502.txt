    "epidemics of all kinds are costly .",
    "the influenza in the early 20th century and the outbreak of sars in 2003 claimed precious lives , and the spreading of viruses on the internet has led to much economic loss when computer systems of governments and airlines were attacked .",
    "recent breakdowns of major power networks in north america and in europe also brought great loss and inconvenience to millions of people .",
    "a less damaging example is , perhaps , that of the spread of a rumor in a community .",
    "epidemiological processes , together with percolation and problems on searchability , are the most interesting dynamical problems in a system of connected entities @xcite .",
    "there are two key factors in the study of epidemic spreading , namely how infection and recovery occur _ and _ how people or computers are connected .",
    "the latter is best described in terms of networks or graphs @xcite in which the nodes representing people , communities , power plants , or computers are connected by links representing the acquaintance among people or the connections between computers .",
    "the most important question is the extent to which a disease ( virus ) may propagate .",
    "since infections take place through direct contact between infected ( i ) and susceptible ( s ) nodes , the underlying structure of the network understandably plays a determining role on the spread of diseases @xcite .",
    "the susceptible - infected - refractory ( or recovered / removal ) ( sir ) model @xcite has been widely used in different forms for studying epidemiological processes such as the spread of influenza ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) and sars @xcite , and also for the spread of rumors @xcite . in its simplest form ,",
    "a node takes on one of three states , namely s , i or r. the r - state represents the case in which an infected node becomes recovered and immunized or , unfortunately dead . for computer networks ,",
    "the r - state may represent recovery with the virus removed and anti - virus software installed .",
    "a node in the r - state is not infectious and will not become infected again .",
    "the underlying connectivity obviously plays a decisive role . for nodes connected",
    "randomly , a substantial proportion becomes infected and eventually recovered from an epidemic @xcite .",
    "however , when a regular network is gradually re - wired into a small - world network @xcite and then a random network , it was found that a threshold exists on the degree of disorderness below which the disease can only spread locally , but not globally @xcite .",
    "networks have fascinating structural and dynamical properties , and they have wide applications in physical , biological , social , economic , and computer systems @xcite .",
    "physicists have made important contributions to the understanding of networks in recent years .",
    "structurally , the small - world networks @xcite and the growing scale - free networks @xcite have been extensively studied @xcite . depending on the model",
    ", the degree distribution may show power law or exponential forms . as the underlying connectivity plays a decisive role in the studies of dynamical processes , a good network model that reflects the structural properties",
    "is therefore required for modelling epidemics or other dynamical problems in a connected population , or in systems in which the entities are grouped in a hierarchical fashion as in a population .",
    "the hierarchical model of searchable social networks proposed recently by watts _",
    "@xcite captures the essential ingredients of a network model of connected population and has enjoyed much attention .",
    "the model is physically transparent in that it is motivated by the observation that individuals within a population are grouped according to their function into different dimensions , for example , their occupation , hobby , home district , etc .",
    "the model exhibits the phenomena of  six degrees of separation \" , which was discovered by travers and milgram in the 1960 s @xcite and has been tested in a world - wide experiment on the internet @xcite .",
    "recent works on networks on robustness of networks under attacks @xcite and ways to prevent attacks @xcite indicate that , again , the connectivity of a network is important .",
    "it is , therefore , important to study the dynamical aspects of the successful social network model of watts _",
    "et al . _ @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we present detailed results of numerical simulations on the extent of a spread of disease or virus in the hierarchical social network model of watts _",
    "_ within the sir epidemic dynamics .",
    "it is found that the spread may be local or global if the population can be partitioned in a unique way",
    ". however , when the partition of the population becomes multi - dimensional , the result is different from that of the searchability problem .",
    "it is found that the spread is always global .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we motivate the hierarchical structure and describe how links are established between nodes in a hierarchical structure with a tunable degree of homophily . in sec.iii , we describe the implementation of the sir dynamics and discuss the results on the spread of an epidemic in populations that can be classified into one and two hierarchies .",
    "section iv summarizes our findings .",
    "the model of watts _ et al .",
    "_ was motivated by the general structure in the groupings of individuals in a society as shown in fig.1 @xcite .",
    "the highest level can be regarded as a population of @xmath3 individuals or nodes .",
    "these @xmath3 nodes may then be classified or partitioned into @xmath4 groups .",
    "each group can further be divided into @xmath4 subgroups and so on .",
    "after @xmath5 divisions the structure has a total of @xmath6 levels and ends at a level where an individual belongs to a close functional group of size @xmath7 , where @xmath7 typically is of the order of @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
    "individuals belonging to the same lowest - level subgroup have the highest chance of becoming most similar or getting acquaintance .",
    "for example , all physicists in academia can be classified roughly by their research area , say condensed matter physics or nuclear physics , and further classified by their subfields , e.g. , magnetism or superconductivity , and then further grouped by their specific research interests , e.g. , topics grouped into the same session in a conference or with the same code in the pacs classification scheme . obviously the divisions are usually not unique .",
    "physicists may be grouped geographically based on the region their institution is located , and then the country , state , county , department , and research groups .",
    "a population of individuals or a collection of nodes may thus be characterized by @xmath0 hierarchies or dimensions , each of which takes on the structure shown in fig.1 .",
    "the structure of the network of @xmath3 nodes is then characterized by the parameters @xmath0 , @xmath4 , @xmath6 , and @xmath10 with @xmath11 , where @xmath10 is the average size of the lowest - level functional subgroups .",
    "an important quantity within a hierarchy is the social distance @xmath12 that measures the similarity between two nodes @xmath13 and @xmath14 . for nodes belonging to the same lowest - level subgroup in a given hierarchy , @xmath15 , otherwise @xmath12 is the number of levels from the lowest for which the two nodes belong to the same group .",
    "hence the largest separation is @xmath6 in a given hierarchy . for @xmath1 ,",
    "an important geometrical feature is that for nodes @xmath13 and @xmath14 with @xmath15 in one hierarchy and @xmath14 and @xmath16 with @xmath17 in another , @xmath18 is in general _ not _ small . for example , it is unlikely that the colleague in the office next door knows your collaborator in another country . within the context of epidemics in a community",
    ", the hierarchies may be regarded as family , relatives , friends , and so on ; or neighbors in the same apartment building , same neighborhood , same district and so on . while the model was motivated by the structure in groupings within a society , it is obvious that many well - structured systems , e.g. computer clusters , are connected in a similar fashion .",
    "computationally , a social network with a tunable degree of homophily can be constructed as follows @xcite . for a population of @xmath3 individuals with social structure",
    "as shown in fig.1 , the individuals are first assigned randomly into the lowest subgroups with an average size @xmath10 in each of the @xmath0 hierarchies .",
    "links between individuals are established as follows . for @xmath19 ,",
    "a hierarchy is randomly chosen .",
    "two nodes @xmath13 and @xmath14 are then selected randomly within the chosen hierarchy .",
    "a link , specifying that @xmath13 and @xmath14 are friends and hence become acquaintance , is established with a probability @xmath20 depending on @xmath12 of the chosen nodes in the chosen hierarchy .",
    "no duplicated links between @xmath13 and @xmath14 are allowed . here , the parameter @xmath21 is a measure of homophily of the system .",
    "the process is then repeated until a mean number of @xmath22 links are established for each node ( individual ) in the system .",
    "this guarantees that for @xmath23 and @xmath2 , only links between nodes with small separation are probable and the individuals are connected only to those most similar in character , leading to isolated subgroups of nodes . for @xmath24 ,",
    "links between individuals with any social distance are equally probable and a random network results , with the notion of similarity between nodes loses its meaning . for intermediate values of @xmath21 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath25 , the network shows small - world features . here",
    ", we aim at studying the extent of an epidemic as a function of @xmath21 for systems with @xmath2 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "we model epidemics on the social network model by the standard sir dynamics , which is implemented as follows @xcite .",
    "initially , all nodes are in the s - state and one node is randomly chosen for infection . at each timestep , a node @xmath13 is randomly chosen among all the infected ( i ) nodes . a neighbor ( friend ) @xmath14",
    "is then selected randomly among all the neighbors of node @xmath13 , i.e. , those with a link connected to @xmath13 .",
    "note that the effects of dimensionality @xmath0 is built in through the construction of links .",
    "if node @xmath14 is susceptible , it becomes infected and the chosen node @xmath13 remains in the i - state ; otherwise ( i.e. , node @xmath14 is either i or r ) the state of node @xmath14 remains unchanged and the chosen node @xmath13 becomes recovered ( r ) at the end of the timestep .",
    "as time evolves , the number of r - nodes ( s - nodes ) increases ( decreases ) ; while the number of i - nodes increases initially and then eventually drops to zero .",
    "the number of r - nodes at the end of the epidemic is denoted by @xmath27 .",
    "we performed extensive numerical simulations to explore the effects of the structural parameter @xmath21 and the dimensionality or number of hierarchies @xmath0 . for each set of parameters ,",
    "data are collected over @xmath28@xmath29 runs , each of which corresponds to a different realization of the network and a different initially infected node .",
    "we take @xmath30 , @xmath31 and hence @xmath32 .",
    "results for @xmath2 are shown in fig.2 .",
    "the structural effects on epidemics can be studied via the probability distribution function @xmath33 for different values of @xmath21 and different population sizes @xmath3 . for @xmath34 , @xmath33 is independent of @xmath3 and peaks at @xmath35 , with no network having @xmath36 ( see fig.2(a ) ) .",
    "the independence on the population size @xmath3 implies that the spread is _ local _ , for cases of large @xmath21 .",
    "this is the case of  regular networks \" consisting of isolated subgroups in which only local spread at the lowest level is possible .",
    "each subgroup can be regarded as a _ small _ fully connected network .",
    "previous studies showed that about 79% of nodes in a large fully - connected network eventually recovered @xcite . using this result as an estimation gives @xmath37 for the size of a spread , in good agreement with",
    "the peak value observed . as only the mean @xmath10",
    "is fixed , each cluster has a different @xmath7 leading to a distribution @xmath33 that extends to @xmath38 .",
    "simulations using different values of @xmath39 reveal a corresponding shift in @xmath27 at which @xmath33 shows a maximum . for",
    "the small - world regime corresponding to @xmath25 ( see fig.2(b ) ) , @xmath33 is again @xmath3-independent and decays exponentially with runs in which the spread can be up to @xmath40 .",
    "geometrically , there exist some links of longer social distance as @xmath21 decreases , leading to larger but still localized spreads . as @xmath21 decreases towards the random network limit of @xmath41",
    ", @xmath33 takes on the form of two disjoint parts ( see fig.2(c ) ) : ( i ) one that decays exponentially near @xmath42 ( inset ) characterizing the small fraction of runs with small - scale epidemics due to the existence of isolated clusters and ( ii ) a @xmath3-_dependent _ gaussian distribution characterizing _ global _ spreading centered at a value @xmath43 that scales linearly with @xmath3 .",
    "writing @xmath44 , we found @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "extensive simulations reveal that @xmath47 approaches @xmath48 , the value for fully - connected networks , as @xmath10 increases . for @xmath2",
    ", the consequence of an epidemic depends sensitively on the structural parameter @xmath21 .",
    "social networks usually correspond to @xmath1 . for @xmath1 ,",
    "the characteristic features of an epidemic is very different from that in @xmath2 .",
    "the most striking result is that for @xmath49 , an epidemic can _ always spread globally _ regardless of the degree of homophily ( i.e. , value of @xmath21 ) in the network .",
    "figure 3 shows the results for @xmath26 . for fixed @xmath3 and @xmath50",
    ", @xmath33 becomes _ independent _ of @xmath21 and takes on a form identical to that in fig.2(c ) .",
    "the majority of the weight is represented by the gaussian distribution peaked at @xmath51 , with @xmath52 and increases for larger @xmath39 .",
    "this result should be contrasted with that of searchability on the same social network @xcite , which occurs for @xmath1 _ and _ @xmath53 with increasingly restricted constraints on @xmath0 and @xmath21 as @xmath3 increases . for epidemics ,",
    "@xmath1 alone is sufficient for a global spread of the disease and the result remains valid for different values of @xmath3 .",
    "the independence on @xmath21 can be understood by the way that the links are constructed .",
    "although a larger @xmath0 implies fewer links per hierarchy , the chance of nodes @xmath13 and @xmath14 being similar with a shorter @xmath12 in one of the hierarchies is higher and so is the chance that a link exists between nodes @xmath13 and @xmath14 , even for large values of @xmath21 . in other words , nodes @xmath13 and @xmath14 unknown to each other in one hierarchy has a chance of becoming connected when additional dimension(s ) is ( are ) added . thus an increase in @xmath0 has the effect of promoting the spread of a disease in a population by permeating through different connected nodes in different hierarchies .",
    "this is consistent with daily experience that a flu may spread first from a parent to a kid ( linked nodes in a family ) and then between the kids in school ( linked nodes in school ) and so on .",
    "we have also studied the case of @xmath54 and obtained similar results .    to further illustrate the qualitative difference between @xmath2 and @xmath26 networks",
    ", we show the mean fraction of r - nodes , @xmath55 , as a function of @xmath21 in fig.4 . for @xmath2 , the large @xmath21 ( @xmath56 )",
    "regime gives @xmath57 corresponding to the case in fig.2(a ) , while the small @xmath21 ( @xmath58 ) regime gives an @xmath3-independent value of @xmath59 corresponding to the case in fig.2(c ) .",
    "the fraction @xmath60 drops sharply in a small intermediate range of @xmath21 ( @xmath61 ) corresponding to the small - world regime @xcite .",
    "this feature is similar to that observed in the spreading of rumors in a small - world construction @xcite . in this regime ,",
    "links between nodes with large dissimilarity exist and hence @xmath62 increases as @xmath21 decreases .",
    "one would expect that the transition becomes sharper as @xmath3 increases , as @xmath27 is restricted only by the connections and is insensitive to @xmath3 in the intermediate regime . for @xmath26 ,",
    "the behavior is qualitatively different in that @xmath60 stays at a higher level for all values of @xmath21 and the transition disappears as a result of the effect of the extra hierarchy for hooking up individuals in a population .",
    "in summary , epidemiological processes are studied on a hierarchical social network within the sir model . for population characterized by @xmath1 independent hierarchies , global spreading results regardless of the structural parameter @xmath21 and hence the homophily of individuals forming a social circle .",
    "this result should be contrasted with that of searchability problems in that @xmath1 alone is sufficient for a global spread of a disease within the sir dynamics . for @xmath2 ,",
    "a transition from global to local spread occurs as the population becomes decomposed into increasingly homophilous groups when the structural parameter @xmath21 increases .",
    "since social networks usually correspond to @xmath1 , it is therefore very difficult to confine an epidemic , unless the  dimensionality \" of the infected nodes can be reduced at least temporarily .",
    "one way to achieve this is to quarantine the infected nodes , which is known to be an effective way in handling infectious diseases .",
    "it will also be interesting to extend the present study to other models of epidemics such as the sis @xcite and sirs @xcite models .",
