    "a short time after einstein published his field equations for general relativity in 1915 , karl schwarzschild discovered an exact and explicit solution of the einstein vacuum equations describing the gravitational field of a spherical body at rest . in analyzing schwarzschild s solution",
    ", one finds that if the central body is sufficiently concentrated , light emitted from its surface can not reach an observer at infinity .",
    "it was not until the 1950 s that the global structure of the schwarzschild spacetime was understood . by this time causality theory and the cauchy problem for the einstein equations",
    "was firmly established , although many important problems remained open .",
    "observations of highly energetic phenomena occurring within small spacetime regions , eg .",
    "quasars , made it plausible that black holes played a significant role in astropysics , and by the late 1960 s these objects were part of mainstream astronomy and astrophysics .",
    "the term `` black hole '' for this type of object came into use in the 1960 s . according to our current understanding ,",
    "black holes are ubiquitous in the universe , in particular most galaxies have a supermassive black hole at their center , and these play an important role in the life of the galaxy .",
    "also our galaxy has at its center a very compact object , sagittarius a * , with a diameter of less than one astronomical unit , and a mass estimated to be @xmath0 @xmath1 .",
    "evidence for this includes observations of the orbits of stars in its vicinity .",
    "recall that a solution to the einstein vacuum equations is a lorentzian spacetime @xmath2 , satisfying @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the ricci tensor of @xmath5 .",
    "the einstein equation is the euler - lagrange equation of the diffeomorphism invariant einstein - hilbert action functional , given by the integral of the scalar curvature of @xmath2 , @xmath6 the diffeomorphism invariance , or general covariance , of the action has the consequence that cauchy data for the einstein equation must satisfy a set of constraint equations , and that the principal symbol of the euler - lagrange equation is degenerate . after introducing suitable gauge conditions ,",
    "the einstein equations can be reduced to a hyperbolic system of evolution equations .",
    "it is known that for any set of sufficiently regular cauchy data satisfying the constraints , the cauchy problem for the einstein equation has a unique solution which is maximal among all regular , vacuum cauchy developments .",
    "this general result , however , does not give any detailed information about the properties of the maximal development .",
    "there are two main conjectures about the maximal development .",
    "the strong cosmic censorship conjecture ( scc ) states that a generic maximal development is inextendible , as a regular vacuum spacetime .",
    "there are examples where the maximal development is extendible , and has non - unique extensions , which furthermore may contain closed timelike curves . in these cases",
    ", predictability fails for the einstein equations , but if scc holds , they are non - generic . at present",
    ", this is only known to hold in the context of families of spacetimes with symmetry restrictions , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "further , some non - linear stability results without symmetry assumptions , including stability of minkowski space and stability of quotients of the milne model ( also known as lbell spacetimes , see @xcite and references therein ) , can be viewed as giving support to scc .",
    "the weak cosmic censorship conjecture states that for a generic isolated system ( i.e. an asymptotically flat solution of the einstein equations ) , any singularity is hidden from observers at infinity . in this case",
    ", the spacetime contains a black hole region , i.e. the complement of the part of the spacetime visible to observers at infinity .",
    "the black hole region is bounded by the event horizon , the boundary of the region of spacetime which can be seen by observers at future infinity .",
    "both of these conjectures remain wide open , although there has been limited progress on some problems related to them .",
    "the weak cosmic censorship conjecture is most relevant for the purpose of these notes , see @xcite .",
    "the schwarzschild solution is static , spherically symmetric , asymptotically flat , and has a single free parameter @xmath7 which represents the mass of the black hole . by birkhoff s theorem it is the unique solution of the vacuum einstein equations with these properties . in 1963",
    "roy kerr @xcite discovered a new , explicit family of asymptotically flat solutions of the vacuum einstein equations which are stationary , axisymmetric , and rotating . shortly after this",
    ", a charged , rotating black hole solution to the einstein - maxwell equations , known as the kerr - newman solution , was found , cf .",
    "@xcite . recall that a vector field @xmath8 is killing if @xmath9 .",
    "a kerr spacetime admits two killing fields , the stationary killing field @xmath10 which is timelike at infinity , and the axial killing field @xmath11 .",
    "the kerr family of solutions is parametrized by the mass @xmath7 , and the azimuthal angular momentum per unit mass @xmath12 . in the limit @xmath13",
    ", the kerr solution reduces to the spherically symmetric schwarzschild solution .    if @xmath14 , the kerr spacetime contains a black hole , while if @xmath15 , there is a ringlike singularity which is naked , in the sense that it fails to be hidden from observers at infinity",
    "this situation would violate the weak cosmic censorship conjecture , and one therefore expects that an overextreme kerr spacetime is unstable , and in particular , that it can not arise through a dynamical process from regular cauchy data .    for a geodesic @xmath16 with velocity @xmath17 , in a stationary axisymmetric spacetime",
    ", in particular timelike vectors have positive norm . ]",
    ", there are three conserved quantities , the mass @xmath18 , energy @xmath19 , and angular momentum @xmath20 . in a general axisymmetric spacetime ,",
    "geodesic motion is chaotic .",
    "however , as was discovered by brandon carter in 1968 , there is a fourth conserved quantity for geodesics in the kerr spacetime , the carter constant @xmath21 , see section [ sec : kerrspacetime ] for details . by liouville",
    "s theorem , this allows one to integrate the geodesic equations by quadratures , and thus geodesics in the kerr spacetime do not exhibit a chaotic behavior .",
    "the carter constant is a manifestation of the fact that the kerr spacetime is algebraically special , of petrov type @xmath22 , also known as type d. in particular , there are two repeated principal null directions for the weyl tensor . as shown by walker and penrose @xcite a vacuum spacetime of petrov type @xmath22 admits an object satisfying a generalization of killing s equation , namely a killing spinor @xmath23 , satisfying @xmath24 . as shown in the just cited paper , this leads to the presence of four conserved quantities for null geodesics . assuming some technical conditions , any stationary asymptotically flat , stationary black hole spacetime is expected to belong to the kerr family , a fact which is known to hold in the real - analytic case",
    "further , the kerr black hole is expected to be stable in the sense that a small perturbation of the kerr space time settles down asymptotically to a member of the kerr family .",
    "there is much observational evidence pointing to the fact that black holes exist in large numbers in the universe , and that they play a role in many astrophysically significant processes .",
    "for example , most galaxies , including our own galaxy , are believed to contain a supermassive black hole at their center .",
    "further , dynamical processes involving black holes , such as mergers , are expected to be important sources of gravitational wave radiation , which could be observed by existing and planned gravitational wave observatories thus , black holes play a central role in astrophysics .    due to its conjectured uniqueness and stability properties",
    ", these black holes are expected to be modelled by the kerr , or kerr - newman solutions . however , in order to establish the astrophysical relevance of the kerr solution , it is vital to find rigorous proofs of both of these conjectures , which can be referred to as the black hole uniqueness and stability problems , respectively .",
    "a great deal of work has been devoted to these and related problems , and although progress has been made , both remain open at present . for a solution of the stability problem , it is important to have an effective characterization of the kerr spacetime .",
    "this is an important aspect of the uniqueness problem .",
    "section [ sec : background ] introduces a range of background material on general relativity , including a discussion of the cauchy problem for the einstein equations .",
    "the discussion of black hole spacetimes is started in section [ sec : blackholes ] with a detailed discussion of the global geometry of the extended schwarzschild spacetime , followed by some background on marginally outer trapped surfaces and dynamical black holes .",
    "section [ sec : prel ] introduced some concepts from spin geometry and the related ghp formalism .",
    "the petrov classification is introduced and some properties of algebraically special spacetimes are of its consequences are presented . in section [ sec : kerrspacetime ] the geometry of the kerr black hole spacetimes is introduced .    section [ sec : monotonicity ] contains a discussion of null geodesics in the kerr spacetime .",
    "a construction of monotone quantities for null geodesics based on vector fields with coefficients depending on conserved quantities , is introduced . in section [ sec : symop ] , symmetry operators for fields on the kerr spacetime are discussed .",
    "dispersive estimates for fields are the analog of monotone quantities for null geodesics , and in constructing these , symmetry operators play a role analogous to the conserved quantities for the case of geodesics .",
