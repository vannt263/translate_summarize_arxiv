    "understanding the structure of a population and how it evolves in time has been a critical issue in modern societies .",
    "having started as an economic problem , it soon extended to an environmental one , and states take censuses periodically in order to use the results to design demographic policies .",
    "malthus was the first who presented the mathematical claim , which has been accepted as the fundamental principle of population dynamics , that `` population , when unchecked , increases in a geometrical ratio ''  @xcite . in modern terms , he meant the exponential growth tendency of a population of size @xmath0 with a constant net growth rate @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath2 with the time derivative @xmath3 ; this is often called the malthusian growth model .",
    "forty years after malthus published his essay , verhulst added the idea of the maximal capacity allowed by the environment , @xmath4 , to the growth model , so that the growth rate @xmath1 can be negative when the population size @xmath0 exceeds @xmath4 ; this is referred to as the logistic model  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the inherent variety of dynamics it may exhibit @xcite , there are also other models reflecting the complexity in population dynamics , one of which has been introduced and termed the @xmath5-logistic model  @xcite .",
    "information on the structure of human population is not only available in many countries , but also very reliable owing to modern census techniques .",
    "various classifications therein allow deeper insight into how subpopulations develop and interact with each other . in this work ,",
    "we classify people according to their family names ( or surnames ) , and study the family name distribution .",
    "these studies can also be important from the viewpoint of genetics in biology , since the inheritance of the family name is often paternal , exactly like the inheritance pattern of the @xmath6 chromosome .",
    "furthermore , if one can identify quantitatively the origin of differences in family name distributions across countries , it can provide an understanding of the social mechanism behind the naming behavior in human societies .",

    "the rank of a family is defined according to its size in descending order , i.e. , the biggest family is assigned rank 1 , and the second biggest family has rank 2 , and so on . more strikingly , the exponentially decaying zipf plot suggests that the number of family names @xmath8 found in a population of size @xmath0 increases logarithmically in korea ( we observe the same behavior for the chinese family names reported in ref .",

    "we investigate the possible mechanism for the differences of family name distributions across countries , by using a simple model of population dynamics .",
    "we suggest that the difference originates from the rate of appearance of new family names , which is checked by empirical observation made for the history of korean family names . in more detail ,",
    "if new names appear linearly in time irrespective of the total population size , @xmath31 is obtained , whereas if the number of new names generated per unit of time is proportional to the population size , @xmath32 is concluded .",

    "( [ eq : master ] ) describes the process in which the class with @xmath48 members increases its members by 1 , which occurs at the birth rate @xmath49 .",
    "the second term is for the opposite process that @xmath50 members is decreased to @xmath22 members , which occurs when one member either dies at the death rate @xmath51 , or invents a new family name at the branching rate @xmath52 .",
    "we consider only the branching process in which a person invents a new name ; changing a name from one to an existing one is not allowed in our model .",
    "the last term is for the change from @xmath22 either to @xmath50 or to @xmath48 , which occurs when a person is born , dies , and changes name , at rates @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively . in this work , we allow birth and death rates to depend on time , and write them as @xmath56 the prefactor @xmath22 is easily understood since the family with @xmath22 members has a chance proportional to @xmath22 to be picked up .",

    "( [ eq : lambda ] ) , for simplicity we restrict ourselves only to the identical form @xmath84 . within this limitation ,",
    "it is noteworthy that our expression for the family name distribution in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pkt ] ) applies for a variety of different situations for arbitrary @xmath77 and @xmath84 .",
    "for example , the widely used simon model  @xcite corresponds to the situation that @xmath85 const and @xmath86 with the total population @xmath87 .",
    "it is to be noted that the use of @xmath86 introduces an effective competition among individuals : in one unit of time , only some fixed number of individuals are allowed to be born or die , which yields a linear increase of population in time , different from what really happened in human history .",
    "accordingly , we focus below on the case @xmath88 to have exponential growth of the population ; however , we consider different choices for @xmath77 .",
    "the assumption of time - independent rates with @xmath89 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : lambda ] ) ] results in @xmath90 . without knowing the details of the generation mechanism of new family names , it is plausible to assume that new family names are introduced into the population at the rate @xmath91 which contains both the population - independent part ( @xmath92 ) and the population - proportional part ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "the second term @xmath94 can be easily motivated if we assume that each individual invents a new family name at a given probability @xmath47 .",
    "the population - independent part of the name generation rate should also be included to describe , e.g. , immigration from abroad .",

    "interestingly , the above results are in perfect agreement with what has been found for korean family name distribution  @xcite .",
    "the cumulative family name distribution becomes logarithmic ( i.e. , @xmath106 ) , which gives an exponentially decaying zipf plot where the size is displayed as a function of the rank of the family .",

    "about 100 new family names were introduced per month , which gives us a rough estimate @xmath131 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath132 , which makes the assumption we made above very plausible .",

    "another interesting case is the japanese system .",
    "again , a japanese family name rarely undergoes the branching process these days , but one finds the algebraic dependency of @xmath139  @xcite , which indicates the fact that many japanese people had to adopt their family names by governmental policy about a century ago .",
    "the diversity ensured at the creation appears to be maintained up to now characterizing the japanese family name system .",
    "consequently , the japanese name distribution can not be successfully explained by our model in which the limit @xmath126 is taken .",
    "another peculiar observation has been found in sicily : the surname distribution from one of its communes shows @xmath140 , possibly originating from the effects of isolation  @xcite ; mathematical treatment of this population has not been carried out . within these limitations of our model study",
    "in which various simplifications are made implicitly and explicitly , we strongly believe that such an idealization in general helps one to sensitively check the reality and identify the most important issue from all the ingredients , providing a deeper understanding and insight .",
    "in summary , we analytically investigated the generating mechanism of observed family name distributions .",
    "whereas the traditional approaches from the simon model are based on implicit assumptions about competition within the population , we instead started from the first principle of population dynamics , the malthusian growth model .",
    "the existence of branching processes in generating new family names was pointed out as the crucial factor in determining the power - law exponent @xmath7 : with and without the branching process , @xmath122 and @xmath141 , respectively , were obtained .",
    "genealogical trees collected for korean family names were analyzed to confirm that the total number of names increased linearly in time , justifying the assumption made in the analytic study .",
    "we additionally reported chinese , vietnamese , and norwegian data sets to examine our argument , which , combined with existing studies , lead us to the conclusion that there are two groups of family name distributions on the globe and that these differences can be successfully explained in terms of the differences in new name generation rates .",
