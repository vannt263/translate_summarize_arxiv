    "so far , a lot of attention was turned towards the understanding of the delocalization process in terms of a zero - temperature quantum percolation phase transition , which still remains a challenge for the theory@xcite , despite intriguing experimental evidence from transport@xcite and local scanning tunneling spectroscopy@xcite . in this framework , the quantum tunneling and interference of the guiding center trajectories within a complex percolation cluster allow dissipation to develop in a non - trivial way at the quantum hall transition .",

    "we will discuss below the various regimes that can be expected for @xmath19 depending on the range of temperature @xmath20 .",
