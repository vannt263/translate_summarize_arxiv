    "experiments at future high - energy colliders will be able to discover supersymmetric particles and to investigate their properties .",
    "a linear electron - positron collider will be the best environment for precision studies of supersymmetric models  @xcite , especially of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . from precise measurements of masses and cross sections , the fundamental parameters of the mssm lagrangian can be reconstructed  @xcite to shed light on the mechanism of susy breaking .",
    "adequate theoretical predictions matching the experimental accuracy require the proper inclusion of higher - order terms in the calculations of mass spectra , cross sections , decay rates    in this talk we present a brief overview on complete one - loop calculations for susy processes and supersymmetric mass spectra , where all mssm particles with electroweak couplings are included in the virtual states . as a calculational frame",
    ", the on - shell renormalization scheme has been chosen where all particle masses are defined as pole masses , i.e.  on - shell quantities .",
    "cross sections are thus directly related to the physical masses of the external particles and of the other particles entering the loops .",
    "we outline the theoretical basis of the calculation and show in a few examples the numerical size of the loop effects , where we restrict ourselves to the case of the cp - conserving mssm with real parameters .",
    "the presentation is based on  @xcite , for other approaches see  @xcite .",
    "the bilinear part of the lagrangian describing the chargino / neutralino sector of the mssm involves the @xmath2 parameter , the soft - breaking gaugino - mass parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and the higgs vacua @xmath5 , which are related to @xmath6 and to the @xmath7 mass @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "renormalization constants are introduced for the chargino mass matrix @xmath10 and for the chargino fields @xmath11 @xmath12 by the transformation @xmath13 the matrix @xmath14 consists of the counterterms for the parameters in the mass matrix @xmath10 , @xmath15 the field - renormalization constants @xmath16 and @xmath17 are general complex 2@xmath182 matrices .",
    "the set of renormalization constants in  ( [ eqn : rvrchar2 ] ) renders both @xmath19-matrix elements and green functions for charginos finite and allows moreover to get the matrix of renormalized self energies diagonal on the mass shell of each of the chargino mass eigenstates @xmath20 .",
    "the neutralino fields @xmath21 @xmath22 and the mass - matrix @xmath23 are  in analogy to the chargino case",
    " renormalized by the substitutions @xmath24 besides those parameter counterterms already present in ( [ eqn : renchar1aa ] ) , the counterterm matrix @xmath25 contains the counterterms for the soft - breaking gaugino - mass parameter @xmath3 , for the @xmath26 mass and the electroweak mixing angle , respectively .",
    "the matrix - valued renormalization constant @xmath27 is a general complex 4@xmath184 matrix .    using the on - shell approach of @xcite , the pole masses of the two charginos , @xmath28 , and of one neutralino , @xmath29 , are considered as input parameters , to specify the chargino / neutralino lagrangian in terms of physical quantities",
    "this is equivalent both to the specification of the parameters @xmath30 , which are related to the input masses in the same way as in lowest order , as a consequence of the on - shell renormalization conditions , and to the definition of the respective counterterms . in that way ,",
    "the tree - level masses @xmath31 and @xmath32 as well as the counterterm matrices @xmath14 and @xmath25 are fixed .",
    "furthermore , one requires for both , charginos as well as neutralinos , that the matrix of the renormalized one - particle - irreducible two - point vertex functions @xmath33 becomes diagonal for on - shell external momenta .",
    "this fixes the non - diagonal entries of the field - renormalization matrices @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath27 ; their diagonal entries are determined by normalizing the residues of the propagators to be unity .      in the sfermion sector , we introduce renormalization constants for the mass matrices in the @xmath34 basis for each sfermion species , @xmath35 , and for the mass - eigenstates @xmath36 ( @xmath37 in general , @xmath38 for @xmath39 ) by means of the transformation @xmath40 the matrix @xmath41 is made of the counterterms for the parameters in the mass matrix @xmath35 . in the case of sneutrino fields ,",
    "the respective mass matrix actually consists of only one single element .",
    "the field - renormalization constants @xmath42 are general complex 2@xmath182 matrices , except for the @xmath39 case with a single field - renormalization constant @xmath43 only .    applying the renormalization procedure of @xcite , the sfermion soft - breaking @xmath34 mass parameters for the members of each isodoublet , together with their renormalization constants , are determined via on - shell mass renormalization conditions for three independent pole masses in the case of squarks and two in the case of sleptons .",
    "the trilinear couplings @xmath44 can be related to the non - diagonal entries of the field - renormalization matrices @xmath42 , and are determined via the requirement of having diagonal two - point vertex functions for on - shell momenta , as in the case of charginos and neutralinos . the diagonal entries of @xmath42 are determined by normalizing the residues of the propagators to unity .      the formal description of parameter and field renormalization in the standard - model - like part of the mssm is taken over from  @xcite , yielding for the electric charge @xmath45 and for the masses of @xmath7 , @xmath26 , and of the fermions @xmath46 the counterterms are determined by the usual on - shell conditions in each case ; field renormalization is treated as described in  @xcite .",
    "renormalization of @xmath47 as the ratio of the vevs of the two higgs fields is done in the @xmath0-scheme  @xcite , @xmath48 with the @xmath0-singular parts of the higgs - field renormalization constants @xmath49 .",
    "in the @xmath0 scheme , divergent 1-loop quantities are renormalized by adding counterterms that are proportional to the divergent parts , @xmath51 of the 2- and 3-point vertex functions , regularized using the dimensional - reduction method . as a consequence , physical observables depend on the scale @xmath52 .",
    "input variables in the @xmath0 scheme are a natural choice for gut - inspired parameter sets ( e.g.  in sugra scenarios ) .",
    "on the other hand , in the @xmath53 scheme the renormalization constants are fixed at physical scales ; observables are thus scale independent .",
    "the @xmath53 scheme is convenient for calculations of cross sections and decay rates , because masses at born level and in higher order agree ( with few exceptions ) , holding the correct phase - space kinematics already in tree - level calculations .    in order to achieve a translation between @xmath0 and os parameters ,",
    "the following two steps are performed , specified here for the quantities @xmath2 , @xmath4 , @xmath3 of the chargino / neutralino sector .    1",
    ".   using @xmath2 , @xmath4 , and @xmath3 in the @xmath0 scheme as a starting point , the pole masses of three particles , e.g.   both charginos and the lightest neutralino , are calculated at the one - loop level .",
    "2 .   from those three physical masses",
    "the corresponding parameters in the @xmath53 scheme are deduced , using tree - level relations ( which are left unaltered by construction in the @xmath53 scheme ) .    in the example below",
    "we show the values ( in gev ) for the various quantities using the sps1a set  @xcite of input parameters in the @xmath0 scheme , where shifts up to 10 gev can occur . +    [",

    "as a concrete example , we discuss the production of chargino and neutralino pairs in @xmath1 annihilation ( see also @xcite ) . for production of sfermion pairs",
    "we refer to the literature  @xcite .      at lowest order",
    ", the amplitude @xmath54 for chargino - pair production can be described by @xmath55-channel photon and @xmath26-boson exchange and by @xmath56-channel exchange of a scalar neutrino @xmath57 , as displayed in the following feynman diagrams .",
    "the above set of born diagrams has to be dressed by the corresponding loop contributions containing the full particle spectrum of the mssm .",
    "the renormalization constants determined in section 2 are complete to deliver all counterterms required for propagators and vertices appearing in the amplitudes , and they have become part of the feynarts package for the mssm  @xcite .",
    "the one - loop contributions can be classified as follows ,    * self - energy contributions to the propagators for photon , @xmath26 boson , and @xmath59 ( @xmath58 ) sneutrino ( selectrons ) ; * vertex corrections for @xmath60 and @xmath26 in the @xmath55 channel and @xmath59 ( @xmath58 ) in the @xmath56 channel , * box - diagram contributions with double exchange of gauge , higgs , and susy particles in the @xmath55 and @xmath56 channel .",
    "virtual photons attached to external charged particles give rise to infrared ( ir ) divergences in the loop diagrams .",
    "an ir - finite result is obtained by adding real - photon bremsstrahlung integrated over the photon phase space .",
    "the sum of the one - loop contribution to the cross section , @xmath61 , and the bremsstrahlung cross section , @xmath62 , is ir - finite .",
    "different from standard - fermion production , these photonic contributions can not be removed and treated separately as `` qed corrections '' , because the one - loop result without the virtual photons would not be uv - finite .",
    "the presence of the photon is required to cancel the divergence from the photino component of the virtual neutralinos .    for cancellation of the ir divergence , it is convenient to split @xmath62 into a ( ir - divergent ) soft part and a ( ir - finite ) hard part , both depending on a soft - photon cutoff @xmath63 for the energy of the radiated photon , @xmath64 for practical calculations , in order to avoid numerical instabilities , @xmath65 is divided into a collinear part , where the photon is within an angle smaller than @xmath66 with respect to the radiating particles , and the complementary non - collinear part , @xmath67 for @xmath68 and @xmath69 analytical results are available ; @xmath70 is calculated numerically with the help of divonne and cuhre , multidimensional numerical integration routines that are part of the cuba - library @xcite .",
    "as already pointed out above , there is no diagrammatic way to disentangle qed - like photonic virtual contributions from the mssm - specific parts .",
    "one can , however , isolate the universal and leading qed terms in @xmath71 resulting from photons collinear to the incoming @xmath72 , which contain the large logarithm @xmath73 .",
    "the separation @xmath74 @xmath75   \\cdot \\sigma^{\\rm born}\\ , ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] identifies a one - loop contribution @xmath76 that is ir finite and free of large universal qed terms .",
    "@xmath76 contains the mssm - specific radiative corrections , whereas the subtracted part @xmath77 in  ( [ eqn : qed:1 ] ) together with the hard bremsstrahlung part from initial - state radiation can be considered as a contribution of the type `` qed corrections '' , @xmath78 it is independent of the auxiliary cut @xmath63 , and it contains all large logarithms from virtual , soft , and hard photons .    with this reordering , the complete cross section at the one - loop level can be written as follows , @xmath79 the small piece @xmath80 accounts for final - state radiation in case of chargino production , and for photon radiation from the @xmath56-channel selectrons in case of neutralino production .      for illustration , we choose the example of the sps1a parameter set  @xcite listed partially in section  3 .",
    "the @xmath0 parameters are first converted into on - shell quantities and pole masses , from which the cross sections are calculated , both at tree level and at higher order .",
    "the following figures contain the integrated cross sections for @xmath81 and for @xmath82 production in @xmath1 annihilation for unpolarized beams , as functions of the cms energy .",
