    "atomic clocks based on coherent population trapping ( cpt ) resonance with a vertical - cavity surface - emitting laser ( vcsel ) have attracted attention as a means of fabricating very small atomic references , such as chip - scale atomic clocks ( csacs)@xcite .",
    "cpt atomic clocks are in great demand for many applications , such as telecommunications , navigation systems , and synchronization of networks @xcite .",
    "such atomic clocks are requrired for their high frequency stability , small volume and low power consumption .",
    "in particular , short - term frequency stability is an important parameter .",
    "short - term frequency stability , described as the allan standard deviation @xmath3 , is estimated as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the resonance linewidth , @xmath6 is the resonance frequency , and @xmath7 is the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "contrast , which is used as a measure of @xmath7 , is defined as the amplitude of cpt resonance over the background signal level @xcite .",
    "therefore , short - term stability is determined from contrast and linewidth .",
    "a high - contrast cpt resonance can easily be obtained in a high - intensity laser field ; however , the resonance linewidth broadens as a result of the power broadening effect @xcite .",
    "it is difficult to both enhance contrast and sharpen the linewidth simultaneously . to resolve this issue ,",
    "a number of methods have been developed ( e.g. double - lambda cpt @xcite , push - pull pumping @xcite ) .",
    "these methods increase the population of the clock transition through using the unique polarization of the incident laser beam to enhance the amplitude of cpt resonance signal . for example",
    ", the double - lambda cpt is generated by exciting with two lin@xmath8lin polarized lasers . and",
    ", push - pull pumping is a method to excite atoms using laser light of orthogonal linear polarizations with the time - delayed optical components .",
    "these optical systems requires several optics ( e.g. beam splitter , mirrors , retarders ) to generate the unique polarization .",
    "therefore , because the optical system is complex and occupies a large volume , it is difficult to use these methods for cpt atomic clocks requiring small volumes such as csacs .",
    "in contrast , dispersion detection methods have been reported to decrease the background signal level@xcite@xcite .",
    "this method regulates the light incident on a photo detector by selecting the light contributing to the resonance to reduce background signal .",
    "recently , the method was applied in the field of high sensitive magnetometry@xcite . and",
    ", it was reported that by decreasing the background signal level it improved the allan deviation by one order of magnitude in comparison with absorption detection employing pulsed optical pumped atomic clocks@xcite .",
    "the dispersion signal can be obtained by simply placing a polarizer or retarder in front of a photo detector along the same axis .",
    "as the dispersion detection is a simple optical system , it enables enhancements in the frequency stability of small volume cpt atomic clocks .    in this paper , we focus on the faraday effect in cpt and propose a method based on crossed polarizers for observing high - contrast cpt .",
    "firstly , we calculate the faraday rotation in cpt under a linearly polarized light field ( lin@xmath0lin ) using the two pairs of a @xmath1 system model .",
    "the cpt lineshape can be estimated by calculating the faraday rotation angle .",
    "both the resonance amplitude and linewidth behavior of the magnetic field are estimated .",
    "secondly , we show the results of an experiment using a @xmath9cs gas cell and the d@xmath2-line vcsel .",
    "the contrast and linewidth were measured by varying the magnetic field and the relative transmission angle of the polarizers .",
    "a comparison of the experimental and calculated results showed that they had the same tendency , and the difference between experiment and calculation was no more than 20 % .",
    "finally , on the basis of the measurement and calculation data , we determine the optimal condition for enhancing the short - term stability of cpt atomic clocks .",

    "the short - term stability of laser - pumped vapor cell atomic clocks is often limited by a combination of light source am noise and fm - am conversion noise on the atomic absorption @xcite .",

    "<S> a method based on crossed polarizers to observe high - contrast coherent population trapping ( cpt ) resonance has been developed . since crossed polarizers have a simple optical system , our method is suitable for chip - scale atomic clocks ( csacs ) . in cpt , </S>",
    "<S> the faraday rotation in a linearly polarized light field ( lin@xmath0lin ) was calculated using two pairs of @xmath1-system models ; the spectrum of the faraday rotation is also estimated . on measuring the contrast and linewidth with the crossed - polarizer method , a comparison of the theoretical model and experiment data showed good agreement . a comparison of the theoretical model and experiment data showed they were in good agreement . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the experimental results showed that a high contrast ( 88.4% ) and narrow linewidth ( 1.15 khz ) resonance could be observed using a cs gas cell and d@xmath2-line vertical - cavity surface - emitting laser ( vcsel ) .    coherent population trapping , chip - scale atomic clocks , faraday effect , polarization selective method </S>"
