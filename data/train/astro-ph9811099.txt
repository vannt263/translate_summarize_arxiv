    "one of the fundamental elements of the study of the evolution of the universe is the investigation of how the light evolves .",
    "the bulk of the observed light is given by the stellar component of galaxies , and measuring the light and its spectral energy distribution measures the total stellar content and the star formation history of galaxies .",
    "using ultraviolet ( uv ) data from the canada - france redshift survey ( lilly et al .",
    "1996 ) and from the hdf ( williams et al .",
    "1996 ) , madau et al .",
    "( 1996 ) estimated the cosmic star formation rate density of galaxies .",
    "the uv emission is more directly related to the star formation rate ( sfr ) than emission at longer wavelengths , because most of the uv light below 3,000     is emitted by hot , massive , relatively short - lived ( @xmath21  gyr ) stars .",
    "in addition , the rest frame uv is the most readily accessible wavelength range in high redshift galaxies with standard ( optical ) observing techniques .",
    "one of the problems which haunts the uv determinations of the cosmic sfr density is the potentially large uncertainty introduced by dust obscuration .",
    "star formation comes together with metal production and , therefore , dust .",
    "the timescales for the formation of dust are short , @xmath1100 - 200  myr ( tielens 1990 , jones et al .",
    "1994 , dwek 1998 ) , and dust opacity may affect the emerging light fairly early in the history of a galaxy .",
    "dust extinction is more effective at shorter wavelengths , so the rest frame uv light is more affected than the optical or ir emission .",
    "the degree to which the light is affected is , however , difficult to quantify as the metal ( and dust ) content per unit mass is only one of the parameters to take into account ; for instance , the opacity of a galaxy is also determined by its gas fraction .",
    "although present - day galaxies are more metal rich than high redshift galaxies , they could be less opaque ; they have locked a large fraction of their gas into stars , thus removing dust from the interstellar medium . in the past ,",
    "more gas was available per unit mass ; thus even small metallicities had potentially large effects in terms of the obscuring power of the associated dust .",
    "last , but not least , is the uncertainty introduced by the unknown distribution of the dust in the galaxy .",
    "the effects on the emerging uv - optical light of various geometries of emitters and absorbers have been discussed by a number of authors ( to name a few , rowan - robinson & crawford 1989 , witt , thronson & capuano 1992 , calzetti , kinney & storchi - bergmann 1994 , witt & gordon 1996 ) , and this is the largest uncertainty in any model of galaxy opacity .",
    "the problem of dust obscuration in the derivation of the cosmic sfr density is widely recognized and different authors have taken different approaches to it .",
    "pei & fall ( 1995 ) introduce dust in their treatment of the evolution of damped lyman-@xmath7 systems ( dlas ) to account for missing high metallicity systems in high redshift surveys .",
    "meurer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have been among the first to raise the issue for lyman - break galaxies , by noticing that the uv spectral energy distributions of these objects ( steidel et al .",
    "1996 ) are too red to be dust - free star - forming galaxies .",
    "they attempt a correction for dust reddening of the high redshift galaxies by extrapolating a method used for local starburst galaxies ( calzetti et al .",
    "sawicki & yee ( 1998 ) reach similar conclusions using a wider photometric baseline .",
    "rowan - robinson et al . (",
    "1997 ) use iso observations to derive the star formation rate at high redshift from the far - infrared emission of galaxies .",
    "renzini ( 1997 ) uses evidence on the metal enrichment of the intracluster medium ( see , e.g. , yamashita 1992 ) to infer the amount of high redshift star formation required to produce the observed mass in metals .",
    "mushotzky & loewenstein ( 1997 ) use the lack of evolution in the metal abundance of galaxy clusters to conclude that most of the metal enrichment occurred at z@xmath8 and , thus , star formation had to be higher than measured from uv - optical surveys .",
    "madau , pozzetti , & dickinson ( 1998 ) discuss the case of a simple model of foreground dust with increasing opacity as a function of redshift , imposing negligible dust correction at low redshift and a factor @xmath15 in the uv flux at z@xmath13 . in all cases , there is no attempt to obtain a self - consistent solution between the correction factor imposed to the global sfr density ( derived from the uv light of galaxies ) and the uv opacity such sfr density implies .",
    "there is mounting evidence that galaxies in the local universe are generally not very opaque , although the quantification of this statement is still under debate .",
    "with techniques which use illuminating background sources ( e.g. : white , keel & conselice 1996 , berlind et al .",
    "1997 , gonzalez et al .",
    "1998 ) , spiral galaxies are shown to have transparent interarm regions at optical wavelengths , with a@xmath9a@xmath100.1 - 0.2 , and opaque arms , with a@xmath9a@xmath101 .",
    "the same level of opacity as the arms is found in the centers of the spirals ( giovanelli et al .",
    "1995 , moriondo , giovanelli & haynes 1998 ) .",
    "as expected , the opaque regions of spirals coincide with the regions of most intense star formation ( the arms ) , as stars form in the dusty molecular clouds .",
    "the uv - optical energy absorbed by dust is re - radiated in the fir at wavelengths longer than a few @xmath11 m .",
    "the energy balance between the uv - optical and the far - infrared ( fir ) emission from disk galaxies reveals that the amount of stellar light absorbed by dust and re - emitted in the fir range is about the same as the emerging stellar light ( soifer & neugebauer 1991 , xu & buat 1995 , wang & heckman 1996 , trewhella 1997 ) .",
    "preliminary results from iso observations of the cfrs galaxies indicate that about 55%   of the star formation at z@xmath21 emerges in the fir ( hammer & flores 1998 ) .",
    "local ( z@xmath60.1 ) surveys in h@xmath7 show that the sfr derived from the nebular emission line luminosity density is about a factor @xmath13 higher than the low redshift extrapolation of the cfrs uv measurements ( gronwall 1998 , see , however , gallego et al .",
    "1995 ) , suggesting that the lower value of sfr from the uv may be due to dust obscuration .",
    "the low - redshift issue , however , is not settled : treyer et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find that their uv data from foca also produce a local ( z@xmath10.15 ) value of the sfr which is a factor @xmath123 larger than the extrapolation from the cfrs uv data .",
    "although none of the above results can be considered final , the available data suggest that dust absorbs a factor @xmath11/2 , and probably no more than 2/3 , of the total stellar light in local galaxies .",
    "the situation is even less clear at high redshift , as long wavelength baselines are available only for a handful of high redshift galaxies .",
    "the optical and near - ir rest frame of distant galaxies is in the near - mid ir range , and ground - based measurements are less sensitive at these wavelengths . on the basis of the uv slope alone , meurer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) suggest a factor 10 attenuation of the 1500     flux of the lyman - break galaxies at z@xmath13 , although recent revisions bring the attenuation correction down to 5.5 ( meurer , heckman & calzetti 1998 ) .",
    "the addition of near - ir data points brings the 1500     attenuation at z@xmath13 into the factor range 2.57 ( dickinson 1998 ) .",
    "the iso fir emission of high redshift galaxies in the hubble deep field indicates a correction factor closer to @xmath15 at z@xmath12 ( rowan - robinson et al .",
    "the nebular line emission of six of the lyman - break galaxies from near - ir spectroscopy also suggest corrections between 3 and 6 for the flux at 1500     ( pettini et al .",
    "optical / near - ir nebular line ratios and co detections have provided additional observational evidence for dust at redshifts as high as z=4.70 in several individual objects , usually radio galaxies ( e.g. , dey , spinrad & dickinson 1995 , armus et al .",

    "the scuba data should provide a measure of the intrinsic , reddening - free sfr in high redshift galaxies as much as the iras data provide a measure of the intrinsic sfr in local starburst galaxies ( e.g. , young et al .",
    "the scuba detections are consistent with many of the objects being at z@xmath181 ; the inferred sfrs have values @xmath125 times higher than those derived from the restframe uv detections in the same redshift range .",
    "however , in the local universe the brightest fir emitters are generally agns or powerful starbursts , like arp220 , and the nature of the scuba galaxies ( agn / starburst ) has not been settled yet .",
    "in addition difficulties in the redshift assignment leave some of the interpretation still open for debate .",
    "the flux density of the current scuba sources amounts to about 2030% of the cobe background at 850  @xmath11 m , and the number density is only 1/10 of the optical high redshift galaxies ( lilly et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to model the average opacity of galaxies as a function of both redshift and wavelength .",
    "we mainly concentrate on the effects of dust on the ensemble of restframe uv photons produced by galaxies throughout cosmic times .",
    "the basic philosophy is the following .",
    "star formation produces metals and , thus , dust . the global sfr density of galaxies",
    "is derived from the observed uv luminosities , which are sensitive to dust opacity .",
    "we solve self - consistently for the intrinsic global sfr density and for the effects of the dust created by the star formation itself , till we reproduce the observed uv flux density .",
    "simple assumptions about the cosmology , and the galaxy and dust models allow us to budget the fraction of light lost to dust obscuration at each redshift . from the computed opacities ,",
    "we then derive the intensity and the spectral energy distribution of the cib , which we compare with the observational data from cobe dirbe and firas .",
    "additional observational constraints , such as dlas and scuba measurements at high redshift , and the energy density in the local universe at fir ( both iras and iso ) , h@xmath7 , and radio wavelengths are used to further validate the solutions .",
    "finally , we discuss the impact of our input assumptions on the results .    in the following ,",
    "we adopt a cosmology with h@xmath19=50  km / s / mpc and q@xmath19=0.5 .",
    "for standard assumptions as to the cosmology , the metal and dust enrichment , and the distribution of dust in galaxies , we follow in time the evolution and appearance of the average galaxy from the beginning of the star formation to the present . here",
    "galaxies are assumed to be already gravitationally bound , although not closed , systems .",
    "only the evolution of the stellar , metal , and dust contents is implemented .",
    "edmunds & phillips ( 1997 ) present an extensive treatment of the chemical evolution of galaxies for different assumptions about the star formation history and galaxy model ( closed - box / inflow / outflow ) .",
    "their work is in the same vein as pei & fall ( 1995 ) , who discuss the evolution of dlas .",
    "the main difference between our and those authors approach is that we do not adopt an _ a priori _ global sfr density ; rather , we start from the observed one , derived from the uv flux density of galaxies , and correct it iteratively for the associated uv dust opacities , until the corrections match the predicted obscuration .",
    "the observed global sfr density predicts non - zero uv dust opacity from the simple act of forming stars .",
    "these opacities are fed back into the sfr density in the form of correction factors ; the evolution of the star , metal and dust content of galaxies is followed again and new opacities derived .",
    "the iterative procedure is stopped when the corrections to the global sfr density differ 1  @xmath20 or less from the uv opacities , where the 1  @xmath20 is from the observational uncertainties .",
    "finally , we use the derived dust opacities to infer the intensity and spectral energy distribution of the cib .",
    "a general characteristic of the model is that galaxies are not a priori closed boxes , but can be experiencing outflows of metal - enriched gas or inflows of metal - free gas .",
    "the details of the evolution of each galaxy ( e.g. , merging , see white & frenk 1991 , versus monolithic collapse , see ortolani et al .",
    "1995 ) has little influence on the model , since the computation of the metal and dust fractions does not require assumptions as to the specific characteristics of each galaxy and its interaction with the environment ( e.g. presence / absence of merging ) .",
    "to some extent , the infall of small substructures into more massive systems , as predicted in scenarios of hierarchical assembly of galaxies ( e.g. , aragon - salamanca , baugh & kauffmann 1998 ) , can be considered similar to gas inflows , although differences may exist as the infalling fragments do not necessarily contain pristine gas .",
    "the determination of the dust opacity requires , however , assumptions on the galaxy s mass distribution and on the dust distribution relative to the stars , which we will derive entirely from observational constraints .        the total mass locked today in galaxies as stars , planets , dust and gas",
    "is calculated to be @xmath21  h@xmath22 ( gnedin & ostriker 1992 , fukugita , hogan & peebles 1998 ) , or about 10%   of the total mass in baryons ( schramm & turner 1998 ) .",
    "similar numbers can be directly obtained from the local galaxy luminosity function ( marzke , huchra & geller 1994 ) . for @xmath23=0.005  h@xmath24 and l@xmath25=2.4@xmath2610@xmath27",

    "the average m / l@xmath34 value used in the above calculation is obtained as a weighted mean , assuming that 20% of the galaxies are ellipticals , with m / l@xmath34=10 ( worthey 1994 ) , 15% are s0 with m / l@xmath34=5 and the remaining 65% are spirals and irregulars with m / l@xmath34=1 .",
    "kennicutt ( 1998 ) measures a typical gas surface density @xmath37  m@xmath29  pc@xmath15 in local spirals .",

    "@xmath112  kpc , is between 120 and 160  km  s@xmath16 , versus a total rotation velocity between 200 and 230  km  s@xmath16 due to the combined effect of the baryonic matter and the dark matter halo ( dehnen & binney 1998 ) .",
    "the local @xmath36 is uncertain by at least 50%   ( gnedin & ostriker 1992 , fukugita et al .",
    "1998 ) , and is one of the parameters in the model with the largest uncertainty .",
    "@xmath36 is a lower limit to @xmath40 if galaxies undergo gas outflows and , thus , were more massive in the past than today , or it is an upper limit if galaxies experience gas inflows .",
    "we note that the presence of metals in the intracluster medium ( e.g. yamashita 1992 ) strongly favors outflows from galaxies , or a combination of outflows and inflows .",
    "the shape , mass limits , and universality of the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) are still matters of heated debate , and choosing an imf for a model is far from being free of problems .",
    "but this is also one of the most crucial steps in the process .",
    "the sfr history is presently derived from the measured uv emission of galaxies ; the uv emission , however , probes only the light from the most massive stars , and the extrapolation to a sfr density requires adopting an imf .",
    "most of the mass is locked in stars with mass below @xmath4112  m@xmath29 ; thus the low - mass end of the imf is the main determinant of the sfr value and , therefore , of the gas consumption rate in galaxies .",
    "derivations of the high - mass end of the imf in star - forming regions of nearby galaxies indicate a salpeter slope above @xmath1510  m@xmath29 and an upper limit of 100  m@xmath29 ( massey et al .",
    "1995 , hunter et al . 1996 , 1997 ) , independent of environmental factors , such as metallicity , galaxy type or location within the galaxy .",
    "contrary to the high - mass end , the shape and low mass limit of the imf below @xmath4112  m@xmath29 is the least known part of the function ( see the reviews of scalo 1998 and larson 1998 ) .",
    "since most of the light is provided by the most massive stars , direct observations of low mass stars are extremely difficult .",
    "measurements of the imf in the solar neighborough and in globular clusters indicate the imf peaks between 0.2 and 0.5  m@xmath29 and has a sharp decline in the number of stars produced below this mass ( kroupa 1995 , scalo 1998 ) .",
    "a recent measurement in r136 , the central young stellar cluster in the 30  dor region of the large magellanic cloud , shows that the imf is salpeter - like ( @xmath7=2.35 ) down to @xmath12  m@xmath29 , and flattens ( @xmath7=1 ) below that mass ( sirianni et al .",
    "current uncertainties in the low - mass end of the stellar imf imply uncertainties in the sfr history up to factors 23 .    following the above results",
    ", we adopt a salpeter imf with a lower cut - off at 0.35  m@xmath29 and an upper cut - off at 100  m@xmath29 .",
    "no stars are produced below 0.35  m@xmath29 .",
    "the number of stars generated is a factor 1.64 less than for a 0.1100  m@xmath29 salpeter imf , and a factor 1.55 more than for a 1100  m@xmath29 salpeter imf .",
    "all stars above 8  m@xmath29 explode as supernovae , thus recycling metal - rich gas into the ism . for our imf , the return fraction due to supernovae is r=0.23 . for star formation extended over timescales of 1  gyr or more",
    ", the fraction of gas returned to the ism must include the contribution from stars between 1 and 8  m@xmath29 : these stars provide a delayed return of 50%   to 80%   of the initial mass in form of stellar winds and planetary nebula ejecta .",
    "kennicutt , tamblyn & congdon ( 1994 ) calculated the contribution of these low - mass stars ; their results , normalized to our imf , imply an effective return fraction r@xmath42=0.46 .",
    "thus , the amount of gas permanently locked into stars over gyr timescales is ( 1@xmath43r@xmath42)=0.54 of the total formed and this effective value is what we adopt in our computation .",
    "the observed uv emission of galaxies provides the starting point for calculating the history of the sfr density , as the uv light probes the most massive stars and is thus a measure of recent star formation .",
    "the uv emission of galaxies has been estimated in the redshift range z@xmath504 ( lilly et al .",
    "1996 , madau et al .",
    "1996 , connolly et al .",
    "once an average star formation history and an imf are assumed for the galaxies , the uv luminosity can be converted into a star formation rate as a function of redshift , sfr(z ) ( cf .",
    "madau et al .",
    "the observed uv emission corresponds to different rest - frame wavelengths at different redshifts : @xmath12800     in the range 0@xmath6z@xmath62 and @xmath11500     for z@xmath44 .",
    "for the adopted imf , which is truncated at the lower end at 0.35  m@xmath29 , a galaxy which is forming stars at a constant rate of 1  m@xmath29/yr produces 1.475@xmath2610@xmath45  erg  s@xmath16  hz@xmath16 in the uv , with little variation between 1,500     and 2,800   .",
    "the observed sfr(z ) , sfr@xmath46(z ) , is a _ lower limit _ to the intrinsic star formation , sfr@xmath47(z ) , because of the effects of dust obscuration mentioned earlier .",
    "a source of uncertainty for the conversion from uv emission to sfr(z ) is the dependence of the uv emission on the star formation history of the galaxies , especially at longer wavelengths .",
    "the flux at @xmath482000     is due predominantly to the short - lived m@xmath4910  m@xmath29 stars and is , therefore , a reasonable estimator of the recent sfr ( for a fixed imf ) . on the contrary ,",
    "the uv flux above 2000     probes stars with lower and lower masses and becomes more and more sensitive to the star formation history of the galaxy .",
    "for instance , f(@xmath50)/f(@xmath51)@xmath51 for the 1500     to 2800     ratio for constant star formation , f(@xmath50)/f(@xmath51)@xmath51.5 for a 1  myr old instantaneous burst and f(@xmath50)/f(@xmath51)@xmath51 for a 15  myr old instantaneous burst . the difference is exacerbated if the burst is lying on top of a pre - existing stellar population ( e.g. , the residual from previous bursts ) .",
    "uncertainties in the star formation history , therefore , account for about 3050%   variation ( and possibly more ) in the conversion uv - to - sfr(z ) .",
    "another source of uncertainty is the potential underestimate of the global uv flux due to incomplete sampling of the lower end of the galaxy luminosity function and , even worse , to uncertain volume corrections .",
    "this uncertainty will predominantly affect the high redshift data points , and the point at z=4 in madau et al .",
    "more than the point at z=2.75 .",
    "the volume corrections for the uv flux density at z=2.75 are derived from a sample of @xmath1500 lyman - break galaxies with confirmed redshifts ( e.g. , steidel et al .",
    "1998 , dickinson 1998 ; giavalisco 1998 , private communication ) ; thus , for all purposes , we can consider this point as only slightly affected by incompleteness .",
    "the uv flux density at z=4 , on the contrary , has been entirely derived from photometric redshifts ( b - band dropouts ) in two relatively small fields ; the z=4 candidate galaxies have not been spectroscopically confirmed yet ( except for a handful of recent detections , dickinson 1998 , private communication ) , so the volume corrections in this case are highly uncertain .",
    "thus , except in one case ( see below ) , we will not attempt to use the z=4 data point as a constraint to the solutions .",
    "once stars start forming , metal production follows with a negligible time delay , as the first supernovae explode after only 34  myr from the onset of star formation ( leitherer & heckman 1995 ) .",
    "our emphasis is on the dust content rather than the chemistry galaxies ; therefore we adopt here the simplest metal - enrichment scenario , the instantaneous mixing model , to derive metallicities .",
    "this model should be adequate to follow the global metal enrichment of galaxies , although it may be insufficient in the case of individual objects ( see , e.g. , kunth , matteucci & marconi 1995 ; tosi 1998 ) . for instantaneous",

    "the analogous formula for gas inflows is given in pei & fall ( 1995 ) and is not repeated here .",
    "the true yield @xmath55 is strongly dependent on the stellar imf ( e.g. pagel 1987 , 1998 ) .",

    "we adopt @xmath55=0.7 ( cf . table  1 ) ; this is an intermediate value between the extremes observed in our galaxy ( pagel 1987 ) , but we bear in mind that it could be a lower limit , and is uncertain by a factor @xmath12 .",
    "this is another difference between our and edmunds & phillips ( 1997 ) and pei & fall s ( 1995 ) approach .",
    "we adopt a fixed value for the yield and change the inflow / outflow parameters ; the other authors change the yield according to a preselected outflow / inflow parameter . in both cases , however , the target is to contrain the model galaxies to have a predetermined value of the metallicity at z=0 .",
    "equation  1 follows from the assumption that the mass of ejected / accreted gas is proportional to the sfr : @xmath60  ( 1@xmath43r@xmath42 )  sfr(z ) , with @xmath61 the time corresponding to redshift @xmath62 ( pei & fall 1995 ) .",
    "the final metallicity of the gas at zero redshift is here constrained to be z@xmath53(0)=z@xmath29 , the mean gas metallicity of the average l@xmath39 galaxy , with the fraction of residual gas being the observed value of @xmath115%   ( fukugita et al .",

    "the evolution of the surface mass density and of the half - light radius between z=3 and z=0 can be due to one of two reasons : ( 1 ) lyman - break galaxies are fragments of galaxies which will merge into larger units and are undergoing intense star formation ( lowenthal et al .",
    "1997 ) ; ( 2 ) lyman - break galaxies are massive galaxies ( steidel et al .",

    "gas fractions f@xmath770.5 generally correspond to redshift z@xmath61 , and we assume that at this stage the effective surface mass density is identical to its instantaneous value .",
    "this assumption of no - evolution for z@xmath61 is supported by the medium deep survey galaxy sample of phillips et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ; the sample has median redshift z@xmath50.3 , and the galaxies show no evolution of either the half - light radius or of the disk - to - total ratio .",
    "the effective dust column density thus evolves as : @xmath80    as extinction curve , we adopt the small magellanic cloud curve ( bouchet et al .",
    "1985 ) , which is currently the only one known for a low metallicity ( z@xmath50.1  z@xmath29 ) , star - forming galaxy ; we adopt this curve as the best available for describing high redshift galaxies .",
    "the choice of an extinction curve is important only for @xmath482800   ; at redder wavelengths , the three known mean extinction curves ( galactic , lmc , and smc , see , e.g. , fitzpatrick 1986 ) give similar attenuation values to within 5%   for a mixed geometry ( see below ) and for e(b@xmath43v)@xmath62 , well within the parameter space we explore .",
    "when dealing with galaxies as a whole , the simplest geometry is a homogeneous mixture of dust , gas , and stars ( witt et al .",

    "1997 ) , is not clear .",
    "we will assume in first approximation the mixed geometry to be valid at all redshifts",
    ". among the solutions presented in section  3 , one case ( model  5 ) will have this assumption relaxed for high redshift galaxies ; other geometries will be discussed in section  4.2 .",
    "observations of local galaxies indicate that the ratio of the scale heights of stars and dust is a function of the wavelength .",
    "in particular , the stars responsible for the uv emission of a galaxy have the same scale height as the dust , h@xmath81=h@xmath82 ( e.g. wang & heckman 1996 ) , while the optical emission from a galaxy is generally more vertically extended , h@xmath8324  h@xmath82 ( e.g. , kylafis & bahcall 1987 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the general result that dust is mostly concentrated in the arms of spiral galaxies , where star formation is occurring ( white , keel , & conselice 1997 , gonzalez et al .",
    "we adopt two different functional behaviors for the ratio h@xmath84/h@xmath82 ( figure  2 ) : one ( hh1 ) which varies from 1 in the uv to 2 at i , with a sharp change happening in the b band , and the other ( hh2 ) smoothly changing from 1 at 1,000     to 4 at i. both functional behaviors are used throughout this paper . finally , we are modelling galaxies as flattened mass distributions and the final ` net ' opacity ( absorbed - to - total light ratio ) is obtained from the average of the model galaxy over all inclination angles .",
    "the formalism for the thin disk opacity model is detailed in wang & heckman ( 1996 ) .",
    "the thin disk approximation does not take into account that nowadays about 1/3 of the galaxies are pure spheroids ( ellipticals and s0s ) and contain about twice the mass of spirals ( persic & salucci 1992 , see also schechter & dressler 1987 and fukugita et al .",
    "we will neglect this fraction because : ( 1 ) high - mass star formation nowadays appears concentrated in flattened distributions ( scoville et al .",
    "1998 , downes & solomon 1998 ) and we are mostly interested in the opacity suffered by the uv emission from massive stars ; ( 2 ) the fraction of spheroids may not be constant in time ; kauffmann , charlot & white ( 1996 ) suggest that only 1/3 of the present - day spheroids are assembled at z@xmath11 .",
    "if galaxies were formed by hierarchical merging of substructures , this may indeed have occurred late in the life of the universe , at z@xmath61 , and most of the high - redshift star formation is occuring in disk - like structures ( kauffman 1996 , baugh , cole & frenk 1996 ) .",
    "the presence of spheroids , in addition , has little effect on the final average over the inclination angles : we estimate that for h@xmath84/h@xmath82=1 and e(b@xmath43v)@xmath61 the ` net ' opacity decreases by a factor @xmath11.25 if we allow for a mixture of 2/3 flattened disks and 1/3 spheroids .",
    "the fraction of stellar light absorbed by dust at uv and optical wavelengths is re - emitted in the fir . in order to calculate the intensity and spectrum of the dust fir emission ,",
    "we need to assume a spectral energy distribution for the galaxy s stellar population and a model for the dust emission .",
    "we adopt for the stellar population a 1  gyr old continuous star formation sed with solar metallicity ( bruzual & charlot 1996 ) .",
    "the dependence of the fir emission on the age of the stellar population is negligible for the constant star formation case , because the fir flux receives the bulk of the contribution from the uv emission of the stars .",
    "however , the 1  gyr population will generally be too blue at optical wavelengths in the latest stages of the universe , as in our cosmology the universe today is 13.3  gyr old .",
    "thus , for sake of completeness , we will also show in section 4.2 the case of a 5  gyr continuous star formation population .",
    "whichever the model adopted for the galaxy sed , the uv spectrum is normalized to the observed luminosities .",
    "the normalization is from the observed flux density at 2,800    in the range z=01 ( lilly et al .",
    "1996 ) , after the model sed is convolved with the opacity at the same wavelength .",
    "the fraction of ionizing photons absorbed by dust is given by the formula reported in calzetti et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . despite the low metallicity seds being generally",
    "bluer than the high metallicity seds , the decreasing average metallicity at higher redshift has a relatively minor impact on the average galaxy sed , on the basis of current population synthesis models .",
    "the difference in the number of ionizing photons for metallicities between 0.1 and twice z@xmath29 is about 13% , and the difference in the normalized uv flux is about 11% ( leitherer & heckman 1995 ) .",

    "our milky way shows a complex combination of blackbody temperatures ( cox , krgel & mezger 1986 , dsert , boulanger & puget 1990 ) , and other galaxies as well are better described by multiple temperature components , with the most simplified models using at least two ( lonsdale - persson & helou 1987 , see also the iso data of krugel et al .",

    "we consider the simplest possible case : a single - temperature blackbody distribution convolved with a dust emissivity @xmath85 , where @xmath86 , bearing in mind that this is an oversimplification .",
    "the temperature of the dominant dust emission component is correlated with the star formation activity in low redshift galaxies ( helou 1986 ) ; in starburst galaxies , the observed correlation is between the temperature and the fir surface brightness of the star forming region ( lehnert & heckman 1996 ) , implying a correlation between temperature and the surface density of the star formation .",
    "we reproduce this trend for the dust temperature with : @xmath87 where t(z ) is the blackbody temperature as a function of redshift and sfr@xmath47(z ) is the intrinsic star formation rate ;",

    "the three main outputs from this model of galaxy evolution are :    1 .   the intrinsic sfr density as a function of redshift ; this is the result of the iterative process to yield consistent solutions between the dust opacities and the correction factors to the uv - derived global sfr density ; 2 .   the dust opacities , defined as the fraction of emerging to total stellar light , at uv and blue wavelengths ( galaxy restframe ) as a function of redshift ; 3 .   and the spectral energy distribution of the cib in the range 1002,000@xmath11 m ( observer s restframe ) , from the integral along the line of sight of the dust emission from galaxies .",
    "these outputs are compared with available data .",
    "the strongest constraints come from observations of the local uv opacity ( e.g. , wang & heckman 1996 ) , from the h@xmath7- and iso - derived intrinsic sfr density at low redshift ( gronwall 1998 , hammer & flores 1998 ) , and from the measured cib from cobe dirbe and firas ( hauser et al .",

    "the main properties of the model are listed in table  1 .",
    "the observed sfr(z ) is unable to reproduce the basic characteristics of the local universe : the amount of stars produced by z=0 is @xmath89  h@xmath22 , or 24%   of the total stellar mass observed today in galaxies .",
    "the residual gas fraction at z=0 is 80% , well above the local value of 15% , and , as consequence , the final metallicity of the gas is about 1/6  z@xmath29 .",
    "the final metallicity of model  1 is so much below solar that outflows / inflows are not required to regulate it , and galaxies have been treated as closed boxes . to create a reference baseline ,",
    "the surface mass density has been assumed non evolving , @xmath90(z)/@xmath91(z)=1 . from the simple act of forming stars , model  1",

    "the emerging 2800     and 1500     fluxes from galaxies at z@xmath60.1 are about 1/2 and 1/3 of the total , respectively ( figure  4 ) .",
    "thus , despite the small final metallicity , the low redshift opacities are relatively large ; this is due to the large residual gas fraction .",
    "the presence of non - zero uv opacities is , of course , in contradiction with the assumption that the observed , uv - derived sfr(z ) is equivalent to the intrinsic sfr(z ) , namely sfr@xmath46/sfr@xmath47=1 .",
    "the magnitude of the contradiction is shown in figure  4 itself , where sfr@xmath46/sfr@xmath47 is compared with the predicted emerging - to - total light at the appropriate wavelength . the fir background implied by those opacities ( figure  5 ) is @xmath625%   of the observed values from cobe dirbe@xmath17firas results .",
    "this comparison , although necessary for sake of clarity , is artificial , because by assumption model  1 does not contain dust , and therefore there can not be a cib .",
    "as a general consideration , model  1 produces far too little mass permanently locked in stars ; even an imf with a salpeter slope down to 0.1  m@xmath29 would only produce a factor 1.64 more mass in stars .",
    "thus the star formation rates must be higher than directly measured .",
    "the predicted uv opacities of model  1 provide guidelines for the iterative procedure to produce self - consistent corrections to sfr@xmath46 , the observed sfr(z ) .",
    "the solution the procedure converges to is not unique ; with our limited knowledge of sfr@xmath46 , which consists of 6 observational data points ( i.e. , excluding the z=4 one ) , we find two solutions ( model  2 and model  3 ) to sfr@xmath47 , when we allow for either closed - box or outflow models .",
    "the case of inflows is also discussed ( model  4 ) , but less extensively , because the solution is somewhat intermediate between model  2 and model  3 . in a fourth solution ( model  5 )",
    ", we impose the sfr@xmath46 point at z=4 to be a constraint , and we also allow for variation of some of the input parameters .",
    "model  2 and model  3 bracket two extreme behaviors of the intrinsic sfr(z ) , for the selected input parameters .",
    "however , as we will see in the next section , one of the two satisfies the available observational constraints better than the other , within the limits of our assumptions .",
    "all models allow the effective surface mass density of galaxies to evolve with the residual gas fraction f@xmath53 ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "the main characteristics of the four solutions are summarized in table  1 .",
    "the sfr@xmath47 of model  2 ( figure  3 ) dictates that star formation increases from z=10 ( our fiducial starting point for star formation ) to z@xmath51.2 , and then decreases from z@xmath51.2 to the present .",
    "the global shape is similar to sfr@xmath46 , but the correction factors are different at high and low redshift .",

    "as mentioned earlier we do not attempt to use the sfr@xmath46 at z=4 as a constraint either in this model or in models  3 and 4 .",
    "the final metallicity of model  2 is 3/4  z@xmath29 , implying that excess metals are not produced ; thus galaxies are treated as closed boxes .",
    "the residual gas fraction at z=0 is f@xmath53=0.34 ; this value is larger than the target of 15% , but we consider it marginally acceptable in view of the large uncertainties affecting each of our input parameters .",

    "such high dust opacity at low redshift implies comparably low redshifts for the main contributors to the cib radiation ; figure  6 shows the contribution to the flux of the cib as a function of redshift : most of the contribution to the observer s restframe emission at 140  @xmath11 m comes from galaxies at z@xmath11 , while the contributors to the 240  @xmath11 m emission are more smoothly distributed with median redshift z@xmath11.4 . at longer wavelengths ,",

    "model  4 reproduces the cib observations with a similar level of accuracy as model  3 ( figure  14 ) , thanks to the large uv opacities at high - z .",
    "for the solution model  5 ( see figure  3 and table  1 ) , the value of sfr@xmath46 at z=4 is used as an additional constraint . in this model",
    ", we also explore the effect of changing some of the input parameters .",
    "the true yield @xmath55 is increased from 0.7 to 1.0 , the latter being possibly closer to the actual yield of stars .",
    "the stellar populations in high - z ( z@xmath182.75 ) galaxies are completely embedded in , rather than uniformly mixed with , dust , possibly a better representation of primeval galaxies .",
    "finally , we assume that the dust / metal ratio does not evolve , but is a constant equal to the milky way value . the effect of these assumptions is shown in figure  15 :",
    "the peak of the dust column density is much higher , by a factor @xmath183 , than in the other three models , clearly reflecting the effect of the larger amount of metals produced ( higher @xmath55 ) and of the larger fraction of dust created ( dust / metals = constant ) .",
    "the match between the sfr@xmath46/sfr@xmath47 ratio and the emergent - to - total uv light ( figure  16 ) is achieved by producing 111% of the target mass in stars and leaving only 6%   of residual gas .",
    "even so , the agreement between sfr@xmath46/sfr@xmath47 and the emergent - to - total light is not as good as in the three previous cases : a better match would require an increase of @xmath110% of the sfr@xmath47 at z@xmath21.2 ; this is however problematic because the model would immediately run out of gas .",
    "the large amount of metals produced requires large outflows to constrain the final metallicity of the galaxy to z@xmath29 : the initial baryonic mass in galaxies needs to be 4 times larger than at z=0 . in the absence of outflows the final gas metallicity would be z=2.90  z@xmath29 .",
    "model  5 does not reproduce the spectral energy distribution of the cib as well as models  3 or 4 ( figure  17 ) . however , the discrepancy between predictions and data in figure  17 disappears almost completely if we change the dust emissivity index from @xmath93=2 to @xmath93=1.5 .",
    "the mixed dust / star geometry adopted in models  24 and in the low redshift regime of model  5 produces a grey effective extinction , namely , a mild reddening coupled with large global attenuations .",
    "this is a general characteristic of mixed geometries ( witt et al .",
    "1992 ) ; its effect is shown in figure  18 , where the attenuation at the peak column density e(b@xmath43v)@xmath94 for each of the four models ( table  1 ) is compared with the extinction produced by a foreground screen of dust with an smc curve and a modest e(b@xmath43v)=0.1 .",
    "the reddening between 1000     and 10000     produced by e(b@xmath43v)@xmath950.3 in models  24 is comparable with the case of a foreground screen with e(b@xmath43v)=0.1 , but the global attenuations are a factor @xmath11.5 larger . as a result , the galaxies in our model universe will appear blue , even in the presence of non negligible dust obscuration .",
    "model  5 stands out from the general trend of the other three models because its input parameters dictate larger global dust column densities .    in the next section",
    ", we will concentrate the discussion on the differences between model  2 and model  3 , which represent two extreme behaviors .",
    "we recall model  4 only when needed for completeness , as the general behavior of the latter is relatively close to model  3 .",
    "the same will be done for model  5 , although this solution implies rather extreme conditions at z@xmath21 , in the form of large opacities .",
    "models  2 and 3 imply drastically different star formation histories for the universe , although they are both reasonable solutions for our model of galaxy opacity evolution ( figures  7 and 10 ) . in model  2 , 34%   of the star formation happens at redshift z@xmath181.2 , and only 2% of the stars are produced at z@xmath493 . in model  3 , 57%   of the star formation happens at redshift z@xmath181.2 , with 20% of the stars produced at z@xmath493 .",
    "the difference between the two models is even more obvious when redshifts are converted in time , since model  2 and model  3 imply that 1/3 and more than 1/2 , respectively , of the star formation happened during the first @xmath14  gyr since the beginning of the universe ( for our adopted cosmology ) . for comparison ,",
    "model  5 produces 1.5% of the total mass in stars at z@xmath493 and 45% at z@xmath181.2 .",
    "model  2 , however , reproduces the cib spectral energy distribution less accurately than model  3 ( cf .",
    "figure  8 with figure  11 ) .",
    "model  2 would not necessarily be in better agreement with the cib if a value of the dust emissivity @xmath962 were adopted , especially if we consider a more realistic model of the galaxies fir emission .",
    "local galaxies are characterized by a broad distribution of dust temperatures , of which our assumed t=20  k is most likely towards the low end of the range .",
    "local galaxies have a fir distribution skewed towards higher energies and spread over a larger range of frequencies than assumed here , with peaks around wavelengths @xmath6140  @xmath11 m ( e.g. , krugel et al .",
    "1998 ) . even if @xmath93 is less than 2 in actual galaxies",
    ", this does not guarantee that the global emission will have more power at long wavelengths , because of the broad fir energy distribution .",
    "most likely , model  2 will still be unable to reproduce the cib at long wavelengths .    as discussed in the previous section ,",
    "models  2 and 3 predict different redshift dependences of the flux contribution to the cib at long wavelengths .",
    "for instance , model  2 gives a rather flat 850  @xmath11 m contribution for z@xmath491 ( cf .",
    "figure 6 ) , while in model  3 the contribution is an increasing function of redshift .",
    "more in detail , @xmath2flux(850 , 2@xmath2z@xmath65)@xmath49=3.55@xmath2flux(850 0.9@xmath6z@xmath62)@xmath49 in model  3 and @xmath2flux(850 , 2@xmath2z@xmath65)@xmath49=0.92@xmath2flux(850 , 0.9@xmath6z@xmath62)@xmath49 in model  2 .",
    "the redshift range 2@xmath6z@xmath65 spans a time interval of 1.7  gyr , while 0.9@xmath6z@xmath62 spans an interval of 2.5  gyr .",
    "since we assume that the number density of galaxies is a constant , such differences in background flux are due to variations in the total fir luminosity of the sources in the band . in model  3 , where the sfr density is constant for z@xmath491 , the flux contribution to the the 850  @xmath11 m band is determined by the slight increase of the dust temperature with redshift and the k - correction within the band . for model  2 , the contribution to the 850  @xmath11",
    "m is a combination of k - corrections and both variable sfr@xmath47(z ) and t(z ) .",
    "the scuba sources , which sample the bright end of the fir luminosity function , should be mostly located at z@xmath492 if model  3 is correct , or be roughly homogeneously distributed as a function of redshift if model  2 is correct .",
    "the current ( uncertain ) redshift placements give 35 sources at 0.9@xmath6z@xmath62 and 810 sources at z@xmath492 ( depending on where we place the two sources of barger et al .",
    "1998 ) , implying a ratio 1.63.3 with a median value of @xmath12.3 between the two redshift bins .",
    "the result is still inconclusive , and must await further constraints on the redshifts of the sources . for reference , the reddest ( dustiest ) z@xmath13 lyman - break galaxies in the hubble deep field",
    "are below the detection limits of the scuba observations ; their predicted fluxes are below 1.7  mjy and mostly around @xmath11  mjy ( meurer et al .",
    "1998 ) , while the scuba - hdf field has a 5  @xmath20 detection limit of 2  mjy ( hughes et al . 1998 ) .",
    "as mentioned in section  2.1.3 , the sfr@xmath46 data point at z@xmath14 has not been used as a constraint for models  24 due to the potential underestimate introduced by incompleteness and volume corrections .",
    "a posteriori , we can infer that model  2 implies that the observed z@xmath14 point should be underestimated by a factor @xmath11.5 , while models  3 and 4 imply that this data point is underestimated by a factor @xmath13 .",
    "we now compare the predicted sfr@xmath47 for the local universe ( models  2 to 5 ) with the results of observational surveys in h@xmath7 or radio , which are less sensitive to dust obscuration than the uv emission .",
    "all our solutions give the local sfr@xmath47 between a factor 3 and 4 of the value measured from uv observations , namely sfr@xmath47=0.0095 - 0.0125m@xmath29  yr@xmath16  mpc@xmath33 at a median redshift of 0.05 , with the lowest value given by model  3 . the local ( @xmath97=0.05 ) , reddening - corrected h@xmath7 luminosity density of gronwall ( 1998 ) correponds to an intrinsic sfr=4.1@xmath2610@xmath98  l(h@xmath7)@xmath10.008  m@xmath29  yr@xmath16  mpc@xmath33 for our imf ; the analogous data point from gallego et al .",
    "( 1995 ) gives sfr@xmath10.005  m@xmath29  yr@xmath16  mpc@xmath33 .",
    "the data points carry a typical uncertainty of @xmath150%   ( e.g. , gallego et al . 1995 ) .",
    "radio observations of local galaxies trace the supernova rate and , indirectly , the star formation rate at a wavelength which is not affected by dust obscuration ; the sfr density inferred from observations at 1.4  ghz is @xmath10.016  m@xmath29  yr@xmath16  mpc@xmath33 on our imf scale , again with @xmath150%   uncertainty ( cram 1998 ) .",
    "therefore , our sfr@xmath47 is in reasonable agreement with the data points from both h@xmath7 and radio observations .",
    "another important check is whether the amount of dust implied by our solutions overpredicts the fir emission from local galaxies , the latter being measured by iras .",
    "the fir emissivity at 60  @xmath11 m in the local ( @xmath97=0.01 ) universe is @xmath13f(@xmath13)@xmath53.4@xmath2610@xmath99  l@xmath29  mpc@xmath33 ( villumsen & strauss 1987 , soifer & neugebauer 1991 ) . the total fir energy density in the wavelength range 81000  @xmath11 m from our models  24 is e(81000  @xmath11m)@xmath56.99.3@xmath2610@xmath99  l@xmath29  mpc@xmath33 at the same median redshift . using a conversion factor of 2.67 between total energy and power at 60  @xmath11 m ( cf .",

    "infrared observations also offer an independent measure of the intrinsic sfr density of the universe .",
    "iso observations at 6.75  @xmath11 m and 15  @xmath11 m of one of the cfrs fields have been recently used to derive preliminary values of the sfr over the redshift range 0.3@xmath6z@xmath61 ( hammer & flores 1998 ) .",
    "the sfr@xmath47 of models  2 and 3 are a factor 1.7@xmath140.25 and 1.4@xmath140.2 , respectively , larger than the iso values in the same redshift range .",
    "the difficulty with this type of observations is in the uncertain derivation of a sfr from the restframe @xmath110  @xmath11 m emission of galaxies .",
    "however , if confirmed by further data , the excess sfr@xmath47 at low - z given by our solutions may imply that either our galaxy model is too simplistic in the low redshift regime , where the dust is mixed with multiple - age populations ; or that the intrinsic sfr at high redshift is even higher than what required by model  3 .",
    "relatively low uv opacities at z@xmath21 require , indeed , a high gas consumption rate at high redshift , namely high sfr@xmath47 .",
    "the average dust column density of a galaxy , e(b@xmath43v ) , is the result of two opposite effects , both monotonically dependent on time : increase in metallicity , which increases e(b@xmath43v ) , and decrease of the gas fraction , which decreases e(b@xmath43v ) .",
    "the peak at z@xmath51.8 for the dust column density in model  3 is a consequence of those opposite processes .",
    "low opacities at z@xmath21 thus require that a large fraction of the gas has been already locked in stars .",
    "for this to happen , sfr@xmath47 at high redshift must be large , which also induces a faster metal enrichment of the galaxy s ism , like in model  3 . as a result",
    ", high - z galaxies will tend to be opaque . the uv attenuation a@xmath1001.85  mag predicted by models  3 and 5 at z=3",
    "is in agreement with the recent results by pettini et al .",

    "1997 , calzetti 1997a , pettini et al .",
    "1998a ) have attempted to correct the uv emission of the lyman - break galaxies at z=3 using the ` starburst ' reddening curve derived by calzetti et al .",
    "in particular , the uv spectra of these galaxies appear reddened by a color excess e(b@xmath43v)@xmath10.15 if the functional shape of calzetti ( 1997a ) is used .",
    "we have plotted in figure  19 the uv attenuation a(@xmath102 ) estimated for the lyman - break galaxies using the ` starburst ' reddening curve and e(b@xmath43v)=0.15 and , for comparison , the effective uv attenuation predicted by model  3 at z=3 .",
    "the two curves have a similar shape and the difference between the two attenuations is less than 13%   over the entire wavelength range 1200 - 3000   .",
    "the implication is that , for all practical purposes , the two curves are equivalent .    the dependence of the dust temperature on sfr(z ) ( equation  5 ) causes the dust to be hotter in high - redshift galaxies than in low - z galaxies for models  3 and 4 ( e.g. , figure  9 ) ; however , the functional dependence is very weak , as it goes as a power 1/(4@xmath103 ) , so that the hottest galaxies have dust temperature between 35 and 40  k in all models .",
    "this is the typical dust temperature of local moderate starburst galaxies , like e.g. ngc7673 ( calzetti et al",

    "the gas column densities at z=3 implied by our solutions 2 , 3 , and 4 are in the range n(h)=(5.412)@xmath2610@xmath104  cm@xmath15 , with the lowest value corresponding to model  4 and the highest to model  3 .",

    "the outflows of model  3 pollute the igm with metals to the modest value of z@xmath108=0.050.07  z@xmath29 , while model  5 gives z@xmath108=0.080.11  z@xmath29 , in the redshift range 0.5@xmath6z@xmath60 .",
    "these values are a factor @xmath134 smaller than what found in the intracluster medium ( e.g. , mushotzky & loewenstein 1997 , renzini 1997 ) , but are comparable with observations of the ly@xmath7 forest at z@xmath10.5 ( barlow & tytler 1998 ) .",

    "about 20%   of the total mass in stars today is produced at z@xmath493 ( within 2  gyr from the beginning of the universe ) . if @xmath160%   of the local stellar mass is in old spheroids ( persic & salucci 1992 , schecter & dressler 1987 ) , then 33%   of the stars which are today in spheroids were formed at z@xmath493 .",
    "these values agree with renzini ( 1998 ) , who argues on the basis of the intracluster medium metallicity that about 30%   of all stars were produced at z@xmath493 .",

    "radio observations of these objects indicate a peak in space density around z=2.5 ; the decrease in density beyond z=2.5 has been suggested to be a real evolutionary effect ( rather than dust obscuration , as suggested by webster et al .",
    "the evolution of the space density of quasars resembles our model  5 .",
    "shaver et al .",
    "have likened the evolution of the radio - loud quasars space density to the galaxy star formation history . however , such connection is not straightforward , as we do nt know , for instance , the details of the process which switches on a quasar , nor have we unraveled the relation between agn activity and galaxy evolution .",
    "it is not clear yet that radio - selected samples are representative of the entire qso population ; thus , the possibility that dust obscuration is responsible for the high - z decrease in the space density of optically - selected qsos is not excluded yet .      using model  3 as a baseline , we modify one by one some of the input parameters in the model , to assess their impact on the results .",
    "our model uses the observational results of pettini et al .",
    "( 1997a ) to infer the evolution of the dust / metals ratio with metallicity .",
    "if the dust / metals ratio instead depends only on the physics of the dust ( e.g , the results of vladilo 1998 ) , and is constant and equal to the milky way value , the consequences for our model are pretty straighforward : low - metallicity systems will be more dusty .",
    "in particular , the predicted emergent - to - total light ratios decreases at all redshifts by @xmath16070% .",
    "thus , the effect of an evolving dust / metals ratio is dramatic in low - metallicity objects .",
    "changing the input galaxy sed from a 1  gyr constant star formation model to a 5  gyr constant star formation model increases the fraction of optical - nir bright stars relative to the uv .",
    "the cib is the only output which uses the galaxy sed in our model , and , therefore , is the only quantity potentially affected . as mentioned in section  2.1.6 ,",
    "the bulk of the contribution to the galaxy fir emission come from the uv stellar light reprocessed by dust ; the contribution of the optical - ir stellar radiation is small in comparison .",
    "indeed , when the cib is computed from model  3 using a constant star formation galaxy sed 5  gyr old , instead of 1  gyr old , the difference between the results is minimal : the intensity at @xmath48300  @xmath11 m is increased by 1015% , while it is practically unchanged at longer wavelengths .",
    "the three basic assumptions on the dust model we have implemented are : the dust is homogeneously mixed with the stars with a wavelength - dependent scale height ; the dust temperature depends on the surface density of the star formation rate ( equation  5 ) ; the value of the emissivity is @xmath93=2 .",
    "these assumption are relaxed in turn in this section .",
    "the homogeneous mixture of dust and stars appears to be a good representation of local galaxies ( xu & buat 1995 , wang & heckman 1996 ) .",
    "however , high redshift galaxies may obey other geometrical descriptions ; for instance the recently formed stars may be surrounded by , rather than mixed with , dust .",
    "this case has been implemented above in model  5 . here , in order to bracket a range of situations , we consider two different geometries : 1 .",
    "the dust surrounding the stellar population is in a uniform shell ; 2 .",
    "the dust surrounding the stellar population is distributed in clumps with a covering factor @xmath150% .",
    "the results are shown in figure  20 .",
    "the uv opacities are overpredicted by the model of uniform dust ( u ) and underpredicted by the clumpy dust ( c ) . in this sense , the two models bracket a range of dust geometries for galaxies , expecially for the high redshift ones .",
    "it should be noted that the mixed geometry adopted throughout this paper produces opacities which are roughly the ` middle point ' between the two geometries discussed in this section .",
    "observations suggest that the ` average ' temperature of the dust in a galaxy is correlated with the density of the star formation activity ( lehnert & heckman 1996 ) .",
    "this behavior is reproduced in our model via equation  5 .",
    "the correlation is relaxed here to investigate its impact on the results .",
    "figure  21 shows the case in which we adopt a dust temperature t=21  k at all redshifts and independent of the star formation activity .",
    "a ` cool ' fir emission from high redshift galaxies in model  3 implies too much flux in the cib at long wavelengths ( @xmath109250  @xmath11 m ) and too little flux at short wavelengths .",
    "this is understandable as the high redshift galaxies contribute to the longest wavelength part of the cib .",
    "finally , we change the dust emissivity from @xmath93=2 to @xmath93=1 .",
    "these two values bracket the range observed in galactic dust ; the exact value of the dust emissivity is still unknown , although some authors favor values around @xmath93=(1.5,2.0 ) at long wavelengths ( e.g. , dsert et al .",
    "figure  22 shows the effect of changing the value of the dust emissivity .",
    "the smaller value of the emissivity index implies that galaxies emit more flux at longer wavelengths . as a consequence ,",
    "the predicted cib has more power at @xmath110250  @xmath11 m relative to the @xmath93=2 case , but fails to reproduce the intensity at @xmath48200  @xmath11 m .",
    "as discussed earlier , the fir energy distribution of galaxies is more complex than the single temperature blackbody adopted here .",
    "thus , the effect on the cib of changing the dust emissivity index should be regarded only as indicative .",
    "the metal yields adopted throughout the paper are close to the median value observed in our galaxy ( pagel 1987 ) , although higher values can not be excluded .",
    "the impact of higher @xmath55 values on our results are straightforward : higher yields mean larger mass in metals .",
    "we have seen in section  3 that changing the true yield @xmath55 from 0.7 to 1.0 generally increases the uv opacities . if the final metallicity is constrained to z@xmath29 , outflows must be present , implying that a larger initial galaxy mass is needed to outflow the larger mass in metals .",
    "larger initial galaxy masses imply larger opacities at all redshifts . in numbers , by changing @xmath55 from 0.7 to 1.0 , the absolute variation of 1500     emergent - to - total uv light is @xmath111=(@xmath430.08,@xmath430.10 ) and the absolute variation of 2800     emergent - to - total uv light is @xmath111=@xmath430.07 , implying that the uv opacities are on average 4050% higher .",
    "we have built a model for the cosmic evolution of the dust opacity in galaxies in order to reconstruct the _",
    "intrinsic _ sfr history of the universe , free from the effects of dust obscuration .",
    "the model uses two basic constraints : the observed sfr density as a function of redshift , derived from uv observations of galaxies ( lilly et al .",
    "1996 , madau et al .",
    "1996 , connolly et al .",
    "1997 ) , and the cosmic infrared background observed by cobe ( hauser et al .",
    "1998 , fixsen et al . 1998 ) .",
    "additional constraints are provided by h@xmath7 , fir and radio surveys of the local universe and by the properties of the lyman - break galaxies ( e.g. , steidel et al .",
    "1996 , giavalisco et al .",
    "1996 ) and of the dlas ( e.g. , pettini et al .",
    "1997a , 1998b ) at high redshift .",
    "the model converges to multiple solutions for the intrinsic sfr density ( figure  3 ) and the available observational constraints are still uncertain enough that no secure choice can be made for any of the solutions .",
    "the solutions can be separated into two main classes . the first class is represented by our model  2 , for which the intrinsic sfr has basically the same shape as the observed , uv - derived sfr , with a peak at z@xmath51.2 ; this solution corresponds to modest dust attenuations ( 2@xmath26 ) of the uv emission from galaxies at high redshift , but larger attenuations ( @xmath14@xmath26 ) at z@xmath61 . according to this model , about 3/4 of the uv emission from galaxies",
    "is hidden by dust in the low - z universe , while this fraction decreases to about 1/2 at z@xmath491.2 .",
    "the intrinsic sfr density of model  2 has the same intensity at z@xmath13 and z@xmath10.3 .",
    "the second class of solutions is represented by model  3 , for which the intrinsic sfr density is constant at high redshift and declines at z@xmath21.2 with the same trend of the observed sfr density .",
    "model  3 corresponds to relatively large dust attenuations of the uv emission from galaxies at high redshift ( @xmath156@xmath26 at z@xmath13 ) and smaller attenuations ( @xmath13@xmath26 ) at z@xmath61 . in other words , according to model  3 local galaxies have on average enough dust opacity to ` hide ' about 2/3 of the uv emission , while only @xmath11/5 of the star formation emerges at uv wavelengths from z@xmath13 galaxies .",
    "the two classes are mainly differentiated by the behavior of the intrinsic sfr at z@xmath491 , in one case declining as the redshift increases ( model  2 ) , and in the other case constant with redshift ( model  3 ) .",
    "because of its shape , the solution model  3 resembles the ` monolithic collapse ' case for galaxy formation , and currently this solution satisfies the available observational constraints better than model  2 .    the various sfr@xmath47 we derive imply rather different distributions of the flux contribution to the cib as a function of redshift .",
    "model  3 predicts that most of the cib flux at 850  @xmath11 m originates at redshift greater than z@xmath12 , while model  2 predicts equal flux contributions from all galaxies at z@xmath491 .",
    "scuba observations should therefore be able to discriminate between the two models , once better redshift placements for the detected sources are secured .",
    "it is worth noting that the input assumptions we have used to derive the self - consistent solutions tend to minimize the amount of dust produced ( small metal yield , evolving dust / metal ratio ) and its obscuring effects ( mixed dust / star geometry ) .",
    "we have seen in section  4.2.5 that a 25% larger value for the metal yield immediately boosts up all uv opacities by @xmath150% .",
    "thus , under certain conditions galaxies may be even more opaque than what we have modelled .",
    "modelling the evolution of galaxies and their properties suffers from a number of uncertainties and unknowns about the physics of galaxy and star formation .",
    "many of these have been detailed in sections  2 and 4.2 .",
    "the stellar imf brings a factor @xmath12 uncertainty in the derivation of the global sfr , because the low mass slope and cut - off mass are not measured with sufficient accuracy .",
    "most likely , the uncertainty is in the direction of overestimating sfrs from the measurements of massive stars emission .",
    "another question mark is whether the imf has been constant with time or has changed as the physical conditions in galaxies ( energy , metal , dust contents ) changed .",
    "linked to the imf is the problem of the effective yield @xmath55 ( briefly discussed in section  4.2.5 ) , which drives the metal and dust production and which even in our galaxy is still uncertain by at least a factor 2 ( pagel 1987 , 1998 ) . finally , uncertainties in the baryonic mass fraction in galaxies introduce another @xmath150% uncertainity in models .    in conclusion ,",
    "simple models of galaxy evolution indicate that star formation induces non negligible dust opacities at all redshifts ( a@xmath1120.82 at z@xmath491 and a@xmath1131.21.5 at z@xmath61 ) .",
    "these opacities should be taken into account when reconstructing the global star formation history of the universe from dust - sensitive observables .",
    "we emphasize that the attenuations derived here are perfectly adequate to reproduce the intensity and the spectral energy distribution of the cib , arguing against the necessity of larger dust opacities in galaxies .",
    "the idea for this paper was born during the aspen winter workshop on `` universal star formation '' ( january 1998 ) , from discussions with rosemary wyse , mauro giavalisco and alvio renzini .",
    "d.c . acknowledges the hospitality of the observatories of the carnegie institution of washington , where part of this work was developed .",

    "<S> we investigate the evolution of the opacity of galaxies as a function of redshift , using simple assumptions about the metal and dust enrichment of the gas and the distribution of dust in galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the method presented in this paper uses an iterative procedure to reconstruct the intrinsic star formation rate ( sfr ) density of galaxies as a function of redshift , by correcting the observed uv emission for the obscuring effects of the dust produced by the star formation itself . where necessary </S>",
    "<S> , gas inflows / outflows are included to dilute / remove the excess of metals produced by the stars for fixed yield . </S>",
    "<S> the iterative procedure converges to multiple solutions for the intrinsic sfr density , divided into two basic classes . </S>",
    "<S> the first class of solutions predicts a relatively large amount of uv attenuation at high redshift , with a@xmath0=1.9  mag at z@xmath13 , and smaller attenuations at low redshift ( z@xmath21 ) , with a@xmath3=1.25  mag . </S>",
    "<S> the sfr density of this set of solutions is constant for z@xmath41.2 and declines for z@xmath21.2 ; it resembles in shape the `` monolithic collapse '' scenario for star formation . </S>",
    "<S> the second class of solutions predicts relatively low uv attenuations at high redshift , with a@xmath0=0.75  mag at z@xmath13 , and larger attenuations at low redshift , with a@xmath3=1.50  mag at z@xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the sfr density in this case has a peak at z@xmath51.2 . </S>",
    "<S> the advantages and shortcomings of both classes are analyzed in the light of available observational constraints , including the opacity of galaxies at 0@xmath6z@xmath61 and the intensity and spectral energy distribution of the cosmic infrared background from the cobe dirbe and firas data . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that both classes of models are acceptable within the current uncertainties , but the `` monolithic collapse '' class matches the available observations better than the other one . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigate the dependence of our solutions on the different model assumptions . </S>"
