    "correlations and anti - correlations between galaxy parameters , known as scaling relations , have been used to understand the underlying physical principles of galaxy formation .",
    "of particular interest is the size - luminosity relation , which has received considerable attention in recent studies of galaxy of formation and evolution ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , observational data exhibit both a large scatter and a significant number of outliers @xcite .",
    "there exist a compact class of galaxies , compact ellipticals ( ces ) , which do not follow the log(size)-magnitude relation and becomes an outlier @xcite .",
    "they are compact , high surface brightness , metal - rich and possess a large velocity dispersion compared to the majority of similar mass galaxies , i.e. early - type dwarfs ( des ) .",
    "so , their origin and evolution are expected to be different from that of des , the majority population .",
    "number of studies discussing the origins of these compact galaxies have reached to the conclusions that are contradictory to each other @xcite .    with advent of large scale surveys and high - resolution imaging instruments , an increasing number of ces",
    "have been reported @xcite .",
    "they are found in a range of environments : from the densest galaxy cluster centre , to the field @xcite .",
    "however , an overwhelm majority of known ces are located in dense environments , particularly around massive galaxies .",
    "therefore , several studies propose an origin via tidal stripping , where strong tidal forces from a nearby massive host galaxy strips off the entire outer - disk component during the interaction and the remnant inner bulge becomes a naked compact galaxy @xcite .",
    "@xcite discovered two ces , each near a massive host and with clear tidal debris , confirming this picture .",
    "other hand , ces are also found in isolation or less dense environments @xcite and in the absence of such strong tidal force , it is therefore naively expected that not all ces might have formed via tidal stripping .",
    "@xcite has , however , suggested that all such isolated ces can be explained as runaway systems , ejected from a galaxy group or cluster by three - body encounters .    here , we present a new compact galaxy , sdss j1229 + 0001 , which , from its morphology , seems to be an early - type galaxy , visually selected to create an early - type galaxy sample from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) colour images . the presence of strong emission in h@xmath9 in optical spectrum , however , indicates a burst of ongoing star - formation similar to a typical blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) @xcite .",
    "we perform a detailed analysis of imaging and spectroscopic data to characterise the stellar population and structural properties of this galaxy .",
    "the multi - wavelength study covering the range from optical to far - infrared data , and based on various archival images , allows us to make an accurate estimation of stellar mass , dust mass and internal extinction .",
    "we obtained long - slit spectroscopic observation using eso - vlt that supplements these data . comparing the derived stellar population and structural properties with those of a well - studied sample of galaxies , we try to explore its possible evolution and origin which may provide some important clue in understanding of the formation and evolution of compact galaxies in the nearby universe .",

    "we derived the distance to the nearest massive galaxies in terms of sky projected separation and relative velocities ( see * ? ? ? * ) and selected the early - type morphology by visual inspection of the sdss dr7 colour images @xcite .",

    "0.005 and z @xmath14 0.005 , represented by blue and red points respectively . sdss j1229 + 0001 is represented by large solid dot and a big circle represents ngc 4517 , having line of sight radial velocities of 2413 km  s@xmath10 and 1128 km  s@xmath10 resepctively . according to a catalogue of nearby groups @xcite , sdss j1229 + 0001 is not assigned to be a member of any nearby group .",

    "we particularly made use of @xmath17band image , which has a higher signal to noise ratio than the other bands .",
    "the archival images of sdss - iii has better sky - background subtraction than the previous data releases . we , further , subtracted the sky - background using the procedure in @xcite where we selected the sky - background counts from randomly selected sky - regions around the galaxy to derive the median background .",

    "although , sdss j1229 + 0001 has a @xmath16 colour index of 1.02 , similar to a typical old  red and dead \" early - type galaxy of a similar mass , a strong ongoing star - formation is also observed at the centre , with a sfr = @xmath120.25 m@xmath7/yr .",
    "nevertheless , an analysis of sed from optical to fir reveals that a substantial amount of dust is present , i.e. m@xmath4 = 4.9 @xmath5 10@xmath6 m@xmath7 with dust - to - stellar mass ratio of log(m@xmath4/m@xmath8 ) = @xmath33.5 .",
    "although low mass galaxies are the most common in the universe , their classification scheme is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "particular morphological traits , mainly in the optical bands , are used to define a particular class of galaxies .",
    "for example , strongly concentrated star - formation is mostly considered for blue compact dwarf galaxy ( bcd ) and irregular morphology with low level of star - formation are characteristics of dwarf irregular galaxies ( dirrs ) .",
    "they are both gas rich and found in relatively low dense environments , such as in the outskirts of galaxy - cluster and in the field .",
    "bcds are , by definition , relatively high surface galaxies compared to dirrs .",
    "@xcite showed that a number of bcds ( but not all ) are structurally similar to compact early - type dwarf galaxies ( des ) and that dirrs are similar to diffuse des .    among the non star - forming families there",
    "exist several types .",
    "des , dwarf lenticulars ( ds0s ) and dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) are relatively extended galaxies with low - surface brightnesses .",
    "the distinction between them is not straightforward .",
    "however , the primary motivation of introducing the ds0 class was the observation of multi - component light profiles in some low mass early - type galaxies in the virgo cluster @xcite  dwarf analogs of the massive s0 galaxies which posses distinct bulge and disk components .",
    "furthermore , @xcite detailed analysis of substructural properties of des indeed supports the existence of disk feature in a considerable fraction of des .",
    "@xcite concluded that the common bulge - plus - disk picture of bright s0s is not applicable , explaining the observed inner and outer components of early - type dwarfs .",
    "moreover , @xcite earlier noticed no distinction in the structural parameters of these two des and ds0 morphological classes .",
    "however , the average ds0 has a brighter surface brightness than the average de , reflecting the fact that ds0s mostly occur at brighter magnitudes of early - type dwarfs .    at the massive scale , s0 galaxies not only differ from es in structural parameters but also in stellar population and dust content .",
    "more s0 galaxies host ongoing centrally concentrated star formation than es and also a significantly larger dust mass fraction @xcite .",
    "there are low - mass s0s which have been explicitly classified as s0 at the same mass as ds0s , but which have significantly higher surface brightness , e.g vcc 1833 or vcc 0140 .",
    "the dust to stellar mass ratio of log(m@xmath4/m@xmath8 ) = @xmath33.5 is typical of early - type galaxies at a stellar mass of @xmath12 10@xmath34 m@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "sdss j1229 + 0001 also exhibits an unusually high star formation rate and dust mass that compared a typical s0 galaxy .",
    "in addition to this , we find that observed light distribution is better described by two component srsic function . overall size , half - light radius , measured in h - band is quite small , i.e 290 pc . given that the h - band is more sensitive to the light of old stars than the optical is , this indicates that the galaxy will likely end up in the compact regime once star formation stops .",
    "compact non - star forming galaxies , somewhat rare in observation , also exist in different names at different stellar masses such as compact ellipticals ( ces ) and ultra compact dwarf galaxies ( ucds ) possibly form a continuum of a mass range from @xmath3510@xmath36m@xmath7 to @xmath3510@xmath34m@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "compact ellipticals ( ces ) are significantly compact and high surface brightness galaxies compare to low mass s0s and ds0s .",
    "while not denying the possibility of it being a s0 galaxy , our results suggest that sdss j1229 + 0001 may be the late stage of a forming compact early - type galaxy .",
    "it is worth noting that ces and s0 morphologies are not mutually exclusive .",
    "m32 , the type example of an ce , also possesses outer - disk and inner - bulge component which has been a defining character of s0 morphology .",
    "recently , @xcite reported a compact early - type galaxy with an active nucleus which is structurally similar to a typical s0 galaxies .      in this section , we attempt to at least qualify how rare the compact , red - looking , star - forming galaxies are .",
    "both stellar population evolution and dynamical evolution of any compact young stellar system will lead to an expansion in size and dimming in brightness .",
    "the observation of compact and old non - star - forming objects means that once they were much more compact and brighter while they were young  if they formed in isolation .",
    "there exist the compact star - forming galaxies , so - called blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcds ) , some of them are as compact as ce , but they are less luminous than ces .",
    "note that all bcds are not , in general , compact galaxies . in most cases",
    ", they are bcds due to presence of blue compact star - forming region on the top of underlying extended relatively old component .",
    "the brightest bcd in the virgo cluster , vcc 324 , has a total luminosity of m@xmath1 = -17.46 mag and overall effective radius of 0.96 kpc . selecting compact bcds of sizes similar to ces from @xcite sample we find a clear offset in magnitude distribution where ces are on average a magnitude brighter than compact bcds .",
    "@xmath5 1@xmath37.,width=302 ]    to get a more statistically complete view of compact galaxies like sdss j1229 + 0001 we visually analyse morphology and @xmath16 colour index of a sample selected from sdss .",
    "we select the galaxies sample from the sdss catalogue within the redshift range z @xmath11 0.02 it is not sufficient to measure the r@xmath33 of these compact galaxies . ] which have effective radii ( in the sdss catalogue it is petrosian half - light radius ) @xmath11 0.6 kpc500 galaxies and a significant majority of them are bcd type . ] .",
    "we find only one additional example , sdss j112308.77 + 624845.6 a very similar morphology galaxy , see figure [ rcd2 ] . which have a petrosian half light radius , measured by the sdss , of 534 pc .",
    "the @xmath16 colour , before correcting the internal extinction , index is 1.3 mag and emission line metallicity , 12 + log(o / h ) , is 8.54 .",
    "we find that the @xmath16 colour index larger than 1.3 mag is an extreme for similar mass galaxies and interestingly non of virgo cluster galaxies , of both star - forming or non star - forming types , have that @xmath16 colour index .",
    "the detection of star - formation activity in early - type galaxies is not new , nor is the presence of significant amount of neutral hydrogen ( hi ) . a dedicated study of hi distribution in es by atlas-3d team detected hi in 40 percent of es outside a cluster environment @xcite .",
    "recent data release of hi survey by alpha - apha team reported that sdss j1229 + 0001 has total hi mass of 4@xmath510@xmath38 m@xmath7 and corresponding value of log[m(hi)/m@xmath8 ) ] is -0.62 .",
    "presence of cold gas in es has been interpreted as indicating a continuing growth of these galaxies up to the recent past @xcite .",
    "they may accrete cold gas directly from the field or via merger ( major / minor ) .",
    "although sdss j1229 + 0001 has the gas mass 4@xmath510@xmath38 m@xmath7 and gas mass fraction -0.62 the observed star - formation rate of 0.26 m@xmath7/yr seems to an upper limit for similar mass ( m@xmath39 @xmath35 -16.5 mag ) star - forming dwarf galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 6 ) . assuming an hi consumption fraction of 10% , the star - formation activity only last 160 myr with current sfr .",
    "so it is very likely to be just a temporary phase .",
    "@xcite in a study of a sample of gas bearing early - type dwarf galaxies in virgo cluster propose two possibilities  either such galaxies have recently accreted their gas or they are in the last stages of star - formation .",
    "in particular , for those which have detectable star - forming activity they suggest the later . is the similar case for the sdss j1229 + 0001 ?",
    "the observed relatively high emission line metallicity may be well explained according to the fundamental relation between gas - mass fraction star - formation rate and emission line metallicity where where emission line metallicity anti - correlates with gas - mass fraction for given star - formation rate @xcite .",
    "we also find that two of @xcite objects , only for which we can derive emission line metallicity from the sdss spectroscopy , have similar value of 12+log(o / h ) = @xmath128.45 .",
    "the study of @xcite showed that field galaxies of dwarf regime always have some residual star formation . the sdss j1229 + 0001",
    "is located in relatively far form the massive halo , so the presence of star - formation is in line of geha et al prediction .",
    "how would it evolve after cease to form star in the centre ?",
    "any dynamical and stellar population evolution of compact star - forming object is likely to decrease the surface brightness and expand the size @xcite .",
    "it is certain that the central surface brightness in optical band decreases as it becomes older .",
    "does it look similar to a typical low - surface brightness galaxy de / ds0 or still remain low mass high surface brightness early - type galaxy like e / s0 ?",
    "the mean surface brightness 17.53  mag  arcsec@xmath40 in h - band is @xmath122 mag higher compared to average value of de studied in @xcite .",
    "similarly , it is unusually compact having h - band half - light radius similar to ngc4486a .",
    "ngc4486a is a compact low mass - early type galaxy in virgo cluster which also shows unusual burst of star - formation at the centre @xcite .",
    "ngc4486a is @xmath144.5 mag brighter than sdss j1229 + 0001 . in this",
    "regard , sdss j1229 + 0001 maybe considered a low luminosity version of ngc4486a .    in summary",
    ", we find a couple of ignored morphology galaxy which maybe more similar to high z galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the red colour and relatively high emission line metallicity of these objects might suggest a deficiency gas mass fraction while actively forming stars at the end stage of evolution .",
    "compact star - burst and dust - dominated galaxies are expected to be common in the early universe  are these galaxies a low redshift counterpart ?",
    "in fact , the formation of compact ellipticals in the high - redshift universe has been associated with merger - induced star - burst activity with dissipative collapse of star - forming gases @xcite .",
    "it is also important explore why there are no such compact , massive , galaxies ( of both star - forming and non star - forming types ) in the nearby universe . while more detailed comparative analysis of structural and stellar population properties of more complete sample would be necessary to establish an unambiguous evolutionary connection , these observational findings themselves maybe an important step toward toward this .",
