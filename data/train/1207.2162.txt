    "tales of freak waves by lucky survivors used to be taken with a large grain of salt . were the sailors making excuses for bad seamanship ?",
    "the first such wave to be measured directly was the famous new year s wave in 1995  @xcite . with modern cameras and video , not to mention satellites  @xcite , it is no longer controversial that freak or rogue extreme waves exist on the world s great oceans  @xcite .",
    "any realistic seaway ( an irregular , moderate to rough sea ) is comprised of a superposition of waves differing in wavelength and direction , with random relative phases .",
    "supposing that the dispersion in wavelengths is not too large , and assuming uniform sampling , longuet - higgins  @xcite exploited the central limit theorem to derive a large number of statistical properties of such wave superpositions , including of course wave height distributions .",
    "from this viewpoint , extreme waves are the result of unlucky coherent addition of plane waves corresponding to the tail of the gaussian distribution ( see eq .",
    "( [ prayleigh ] ) below ) .",
    "as explained below , wave heights greater than about @xmath0 in the tail of the gaussian are classified as extreme .",
    "the problem has become how to explain why the observed number of rogue wave events is greater than the number @xmath1 out in the longuet - higgins theory .    for the following discussion",
    ", it is important to understand why a 20 meter wave in a sea where the significant wave height ( swh , defined as the average height of the highest one third of the waves ) is 18 meters is far less onerous than a 20 meter wave where the swh is 8 meters .",
    "an established seaway of uniform energy density ( uniform if averaged over an area large compared to the typical wavelength ) is `` accommodated '' over time and distance , through nonlinear energy transfer mechanisms .",
    "seaways of higher energy density develop correspondingly longer wave periods and wavelengths , even with no further wind forcing , keeping wave steepness under control as a result .",
    "this accommodation process is one of the ways nonlinear processes are implicitly lurking behind `` linear '' theories , in that the input into the linear theories , i.e. , the swh , the period , dispersion in direction , and dispersion in wavelength are all the result of prior nonlinear processes .",
    "a 20 meter wave in a sea of swh 8 meters is necessarily very steep , possibly breaking , with a deep narrow trough preceding it .",
    "the tendency for steep waves to break is an often devastating blow just as the ship is sailing over an unusually deep trough before meeting the crest .",
    "observational evidence has shown that the linear longuet - higgins theory is too simplistic  @xcite .",
    "recent advances in technology have allowed multiple wave tank experiments and field observations to be conducted , confirming the need for a more realistic theory to explain the results  @xcite .",
    "an obvious correction is to incorporate nonlinear wave evolution at every stage , rather than split the process into an implicit nonlinear preparation of the seaway followed by linear propagation .",
    "clearly the exact evolution is always nonlinear to some extent , but the key is to introduce nonlinearities at the right moment and in an insightful and computable way .",
    "realistic fully nonlinear computations wave by wave over large areas are very challenging , but initial attempts have been made to simulate the ocean surface using the full euler equation both on large scales  @xcite and over smaller areas  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , investigation of nonlinear effects is actually not the next logical step needed to improve upon the longuet - higgins model .",
    "indeed the full _ linear _ statistical theory had not been given , for the reason that uniform sampling assumed by longuet - higgins is not justified .",
    "a nonuniform sampling theory , which does not assume that the energy density is uniformly distributed over all space , is possible and is still `` linear . ''",
    "moreover , the parameters governing a nonuniform sampling are knowable .",
    "inspired by the work of white and fornberg  @xcite , the present authors showed that current eddies commonly present in the oceans are sufficient to cause the time - averaged wave intensity to be spatially non - uniform , and to exhibit `` hot spots '' and `` cold spots '' some tens to hundreds of kilometers down flow from the eddies .",
    "we emphasize that in terms of wave evolution , the refraction leading to the patchy energy density is purely linear evolution .",
    "the key ideas are ( 1 ) that waves suddenly entering a high energy patch are not accommodated to it and grow steep and dangerous , and ( 2 ) the process is still probabilistic and the central limit theorem still applies , with the appropriate sampling over a nonuniform distribution .",
    "the high - energy patches will skew the tails of the wave height distribution , perhaps by orders of magnitude .",
    "this was the main point in reference  @xcite .",
    "there is no denying the importance of nonlinear effects in wave evolution , and a full theory should certainly include them . on the other hand a nonlinear theory that fails to account for patchy energy density is missing an important , even crucial effect .",
    "the linear theory needs to be supplemented by nonlinear effects however , since the accommodation of the waves to the presence of patchy energy density needs to be considered .",
    "it is our goal here to review progress along these lines and point the way to a more complete theory .",
    "we first review the nonuniform sampling linear theory and then discuss newer simulations using the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) .",
    "finally , we show that even larger rogue wave formation probabilities are predicted when linear and nonlinear formation mechanisms are acting in concert .",
    "rogue wave modeling would benefit greatly from a comprehensive , accurate , and unbiased global record of extreme wave events , supplemented by data on local ocean conditions , including current strength , swh , steepness , and the angular and spectral spread of the sea state .",
    "such a record , not available at present , would allow for direct statistical tests of linear and nonlinear theories of rogue wave formation .",
    "anecdotal evidence does suggest that rogue waves may be especially prevalent in regions of strong current , including the gulf stream , the kuroshio current , and especially the agulhas current off the coast of south africa .",
    "consequently , the agulhas current in particular has attracted much attention in rogue wave research  @xcite .",
    "however , anecdotal evidence from ships and even oil platform measurements can not provide a systematic , unbiased , and statistically valid record that would support a correlation between possibly relevant variables and rogue wave formation probability .",
    "instead , satellite - based synthetic aperture radar ( sar )  @xcite is currently the only method that shows potential for monitoring the ocean globally with single - wave resolution , but validating the surface elevations obtained by sar is a challenge .",
    "the sar imaging mechanism is nonlinear , and may yield a distorted image of the ocean wave field ; the nonlinearity is of course of particular concern for extreme events  @xcite .",
    "recently , an empirical approach has been proposed that may accurately obtain parameters such as the swh from sar data  @xcite .",
    "to understand the physics of linear rogue wave formation in the presence of currents , it is very helpful to begin with a ray , or eikonal , approximation for wave evolution in the ocean  @xcite , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the ray position , @xmath4 is the wave vector , and @xmath5 is the frequency . for surface gravity waves in deep water ,",
    "the dispersion relation is @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the current velocity , assumed for simplicity to be time - independent , and @xmath8  m / s is the acceleration due to gravity .",
    "the validity of the ray approximation depends firstly on the condition @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the length scale on which the current field @xmath7 is varying , physically corresponding to the typical eddy size .",
    "this condition is well satisfied in nature , since wave numbers of interest in the deep ocean are normally of order @xmath11 , while the typical eddy size may be @xmath12 or larger .",
    "secondly , scattering of the waves by currents is assumed to be weak , i.e. , the second term in equation  ( [ dispers ] ) should be small compared to the free term .",
    "this again is well justified since eddy current speeds @xmath13 are normally less than @xmath14 , whereas the wave speed @xmath15 is greater than @xmath16 . in section  [ seclinnumerical ]",
    "below , we will explicitly compare the ray predictions with results obtained by exact integration of the corresponding wave equation .",

    "the detailed structure of the individual eddies on the scale @xmath10 has no effect on the final rogue wave statistics as long as the current is weak ( @xmath30 ) , since each ray must travel a distance @xmath31 before being appreciably scattered .",
    "each panel in figure  [ figrayimage ] represents a @xmath17 km by @xmath17 km random eddy field , with rms eddy current @xmath18 m / s and eddy correlation length @xmath19 km .",
    "the initial swell , entering from the left in each panel , is characterized by a single frequency @xmath32 ( and thus a single wave number @xmath33 and a single wave speed @xmath34 m / s ) . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , within the context of a linear model , a nonzero frequency spread affects rogue wave formation only at second order in the spread @xmath35 , and may be neglected for all practical purposes .",
    "in contrast , the _ angular _ spread of the incoming sea is very important in determining rogue wave statistics . in this figure",
    ", we consider an initially gaussian angular distribution @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the wave vector direction relative to the mean direction of wave propagation . here",
    "all rays begin at the left edge of each panel , uniformly distributed in the @xmath38 direction , and the mean direction of wave propagation is rightward .",
    "the left and right panels illustrate the behavior for two different values of the initial angular spread @xmath20 .    in both panels we observe bright streaks or branches , corresponding to regions of larger than average ray density @xmath39 , and thus larger than average wave intensity .",
    "the branches may be understood by considering briefly the limiting ( unphysical ) case of a unidirectional initial sea state ( @xmath40 ) , corresponding to a single incoming plane wave . in the ray picture , and in the coordinates of figure  [ figrayimage ] , the initial conditions are in this limit characterized by a one - dimensional phase space manifold @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the fixed wave number , and @xmath38 varies over all space .",
    "as this incoming plane wave travels through the random current field , it undergoes small - angle scattering , with scattering angle @xmath43 after traveling one correlation length @xmath10 in the forward direction .",
    "eventually , singularities appear that are characterized in the surface of section map @xmath44\\to [ y(x),k_y(x)]$ ] by @xmath45 , i.e. , by local focusing of the manifold of initial conditions at a point @xmath46 .    the currents leading to such a focusing singularity",
    "may be thought of as forming a ` bad lens . ' whereas a lens without aberration focuses all parallel incoming rays to one point , a bad lens only focuses at each point an infinitesimal neighborhood of nearby rays , so that different neighborhoods get focused at different places as the phase - space manifold evolves forward in @xmath47 , resulting in lines , or branches , of singularities .",
    "the typical pattern is an isolated cusp singularity , @xmath48 , followed by two branches of fold singularities , as shown in figure  [ figcusp ] .        .",
    "[ figcusp ]    a simple scaling argument  @xcite shows that the first singularities occur after a median distance @xmath49 along the direction of travel . when the typical ray excursion in the transverse @xmath47 direction becomes of order @xmath10 .",
    "thus , each ray passes through many uncorrelated eddies before a singularity occurs , and a statistical description is well justified .",
    "for realistic parameters , @xmath50 km or more is typical .",
    "the cusp singularities formed in this way are separated by a typical distance @xmath10 in the transverse direction , and thus the rms deflection angle by the time these singularities appear scales as @xmath51 we note that the typical deflection angle @xmath52 does not depend on the eddy size but only on the velocity ratio @xmath53 : faster currents cause larger deflection . for the input parameters used in figure  [ figrayimage ]",
    ", the median distance to the first singularity is @xmath54  km , and the rms deflection at the point of singularity is @xmath55 .",
    "similar phenomenology can give rise to wave focusing and rogue wave formation in shallow water , where the dispersion relation of equation  ( [ dispers ] ) is replaced with @xmath56 , and varying depth @xmath57 takes the place of the varying current @xmath58 as the origin of scattering  @xcite . the same mechanism",
    "can lead to amplification of tsunami waves  @xcite where because of the long wavelength , shallow water equations apply . fig .",
    "[ figtsunami ] shows a striking recent example of a predicted tsunami wave height map , in which the branched flow structure is unmistakably present .",

    "recently , universal expressions have been obtained describing the branching statistics for a large class of such systems , and valid at all distances from a source  @xcite .    .",
    "the input parameters are chosen as in figure  [ figrayimage ] , with initial angular spread @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 corresponding to freak index @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , respectively .",

    ", the scattering produces only small perturbations of order @xmath70 in the ray density @xmath39 , in units where the initial ( uniform ) density is @xmath71  @xcite .",
    "specifically , as seen in figure  [ figraychisq ] , the distribution of ray intensities in this regime may be well described by a @xmath65 distribution  @xcite , @xmath72 where the number of degrees of freedom @xmath73 scales with the freak index as @xmath74 .",
    "the proportionality constant may be obtained numerically by a fit to the data : @xmath75 in the limit @xmath76 associated with zero current , we have @xmath77 , and we recover as expected the uniform ray density distribution @xmath78 .      in the longuet - higgins random seas model  @xcite ,",
    "the sea surface elevation above the average elevation is given by @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is a random superposition of many plane waves with differing directions and frequencies . by the central limit theorem ,",
    "@xmath80 is distributed as a complex gaussian random variable with standard deviation @xmath81 .",
    "furthermore , for a narrow - banded spectrum ( @xmath82 ) the wave crest height @xmath83 is equal to the wave function amplitude @xmath84 , and the probability of encountering a wave crest of height @xmath83 or larger is @xmath85 due to an exact symmetry between crests and troughs in a linear wave model , a crest height of @xmath83 corresponds to a wave height ( crest to trough ) of @xmath86 .",
    "conventionally , a rogue wave is defined as @xmath87 , where the significant wave height @xmath88 is the average of the largest one third of wave heights in a time series , or approximately @xmath89 .",
    "thus the condition for a rogue wave is @xmath90 , and the random seas model predicts such waves to occur with probability @xmath91 .",
    "similarly , extreme rogue waves may be defined by the condition @xmath92 or @xmath93 , and these are predicted to occur with probability @xmath94 within the random seas model . as discussed in section  [ secintro ] ,",
    "the random seas model greatly underestimates the occurrence probability of extreme waves , when compared with observational data  @xcite .    what are the implications of scattering by currents , as discussed in section  [ secrayinten ] , on the wave height statistics ? within the regime of validity of the ray approximation",
    ", we have at any spatial point @xmath46 correspondence between the ray density @xmath39 and the wave intensity @xmath95 , averaged over time .",
    "thus , in contrast with the original longuet - higgins model , the time - averaged wave intensity is not uniform over all space but instead exhibits `` hot spots '' and `` cold spots '' associated with focusing and defocusing in the corresponding ray equations . at each point in space",

    "this is the situation a ship experiences at a given position .    now averaging over space , or over an ensemble of random eddy fields with a given rms current speed , we obtain a total cumulative height distribution @xmath98 in equation  ( [ ptotal ] ) ,",
    "the full cumulative distribution of wave heights for a given sea state has been expressed as a convolution of two factors : ( i ) the local density distribution @xmath99 , which can be extracted from the ray dynamics , and ( ii ) the universal longuet - higgins distribution of wave heights for a given local density .",
    "similar decompositions of chaotic wave function statistics into non - universal and universal components have found broad applicability in quantum chaos , including for example in the theory of scars  @xcite . in the context of rogue waves ,",
    "a similar approach was adopted by regev _",

    "the three situations considered are : ( a ) linear scattering by random currents of rms speed @xmath128  m / s and eddy correlation length @xmath129  m , ( b ) nonlinear evolution with initial steepness @xmath130 and without currents , and ( c ) nonlinear evolution in the presence of currents . , width=384 ]    this behavior is illustrated in figure  [ figspatial ] for linear evolution with random currents , nonlinear evolution in the absence of currents , and for a scenario in which the two mechanisms are both active .",
    "here we use the fourth moment @xmath131 as a convenient measure of the size of the tail of the wave height distribution . note that for the chosen parameters , the distance scales associated with linear and nonlinear rogue wave formation are comparable . clearly , in this case currents have a greater effect than nonlinear focusing , but the strongest deviations from rayleigh statistics",

    "this is indeed what we clearly observe in figure  [ fignonlincurrent ] , for the scenario where nonlinearity and currents are both present .",
    "again we see from figure  [ fignonlincurrent ] that deviations from rayleigh statistics become ever more pronounced as taller and taller waves are considered , as expected from the asymptotic form of the k - distribution ( equation  ( [ asympt ] ) ) .",

    "it will take some time to sort out the mechanisms of rogue wave formation with complete certainty .",
    "all potentially important factors and mechanisms ought to be included in the discourse , which we hope will someday lead to agreement about the several formation mechanisms and their interactions . more importantly",
    ", predictive tools leading to safer navigation should eventually emerge .",
    "one of the seemingly important factors , which might be called `` statistical focusing , '' is highlighted here . in terms of wave propagation ,",
    "statistical focusing is a linear effect ( although it is nonlinear dynamics at the level of ray tracing ) .",
    "it leads to large enhancements in the frequency of rogue wave formation under reasonable sea state assumptions .",
    "statistical focusing combines the effects of deterministic wave refraction by current eddies with longuet - higgins statistical ideas under realistic conditions .",
    "the key notion is that the focusing effects of eddies , which would be very dramatic on an ( unrealistic ) monochromatic and unidirectional sea , are not altogether washed out when realistic frequency and directional dispersion are included .",
    "essentially , deterministic caustics present in the unrealistic idealization are smoothed into hot spots , which are then treated statistically within longuet - higgins theory .",
    "the hot spots dominate the statistics in the tail of the wave height distribution .",
    "this amounts to a nonuniform sampling version of longuet - higgins theory , with a solid basis for the nonuniform energy density distributions used .",
    "since nonlinear effects are also important , we have examined them alone within the popular fourth - order nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) approximation for nonlinear wave evolution under realistic seaway conditions . finally , we have investigated the combined effect of nonlinear wave evolution and statistical focusing .",
    "we find that strongest deviations from rayleigh statistics are observed when linear scattering ( statistical focusing ) and nonlinear interaction ( nlse ) are both present .",
    "however , for the parameters chosen here at least , the linear scattering due to eddies was more important than the nonlinear effects , which require large steepness or a very narrow range of propagation directions to become significant .",
    "we have presented a measure closely related to the probability of rogue wave formation , the freak index @xmath69 .",
    "this could conceivably become the basis for a probabilistic forecast of rogue wave formation , in the spirit of rainfall forecasts .",
    "there are at least three clear directions for future development of the work presented here .",
    "first , both the computer simulations and the theory must be developed further to explore fully and systematically the combined effects of nonlinear and linear focusing .",
    "this will also involve investigating in depth the underlying mechanism through which the formation of hot and cold spots is aided by nonlinear focusing .",
    "secondly , a better understanding is needed of the stability of the hot spot patterns under slow changes in the current field or in the spectrum or directionality of the incoming sea .",
    "the strength of what might be called scintillation or twinkling  @xcite in analogy with the case of light traveling through the atmosphere will have important consequences for the predictive power of the model .",
    "thirdly , and most importantly , there is a clear need to compare the model simulations with observations and experiments .",
    "although comprehensive global data are not available at this point , it may be possible to compare the results to local observations where data are more readily available , e.g. , in the north sea .    whatever the final word is on rogue wave formation ( or final words , because there may be more than one mechanism )",
    ", it must involve a reallocation of energy from a larger area to a smaller one .",
    "waves can not propagate and increase in height at no expense to their neighbors : the energy has to come from somewhere , and the effect must be to reduce the wave energy somewhere else .",

    "<S> we review recent progress in modeling the probability distribution of wave heights in the deep ocean as a function of a small number of parameters describing the local sea state . both linear and nonlinear mechanisms of rogue wave formation </S>",
    "<S> are considered . </S>",
    "<S> first , we show that when the average wave steepness is small and nonlinear wave effects are subleading , the wave height distribution is well explained by a single `` freak index '' parameter , which describes the strength of ( linear ) wave scattering by random currents relative to the angular spread of the incoming random sea . </S>",
    "<S> when the average steepness is large , the wave height distribution takes a very similar functional form , but the key variables determining the probability distribution are the steepness , and the angular and frequency spread of the incoming waves . finally , even greater probability of extreme wave formation is predicted when linear and nonlinear effects are acting together . </S>"
