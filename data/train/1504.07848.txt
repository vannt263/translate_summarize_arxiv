    "after the discovery of 125-gev higgs boson with many properties consistent with the standard model ( sm ) expectations  @xcite , we are left with two pieces of empirical evidence that call for new physics explanations .",
    "one is the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations that leads to the question about how neutrino mass is generated .",
    "the other is astronomical observation of gravitational effects caused by dark matter ( dm ) , whose abundance is bound to be about 5 times that of ordinary matter .    in the sm ,",
    "masses of quarks and massive gauge bosons are generated through yukawa and gauge couplings with the condensate of the higgs doublet field through the brout - englert - higgs ( beh ) mechanism  @xcite .",
    "one minimal extension for giving tiny mass to neutrinos is done by introducing a complex higgs triplet through the type - ii seesaw mechanism , the so - called higgs triplet model ( htm )  @xcite . in this case , the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs triplet field is induced by electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) and controls whether the charged higgs bosons derived from the triplet field decay dominantly to leptons or weak gauge bosons .",
    "direct searches of the doubly charged higgs boson predicted in this model at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) generally put a lower mass bound at about 400 gev  @xcite .    in the past few years",
    ", many experiments have reported indirect evidence of dm , such as the excess of positron fraction observed by pamela  @xcite , fermi - lat  @xcite and ams-02  @xcite , the excess of positron+electron flux observed by atic  @xcite , hess  @xcite , fermi - lat  @xcite , pamela  @xcite and ams-02  @xcite , the excess of gamma - ray spectrum at the galactic center  @xcite , and so on .",
    "the ams collaboration also confirms with an unprecedented precision the excess of positron fraction in the energy range of @xmath2 $ ] gev  @xcite , the positron+electron flux from 0.5 gev to 1 tev  @xcite , and a deviation of the antiproton fraction from secondary astrophysical sources of cosmic ray collisions for the antiproton kinetic energy between @xmath3 gev  @xcite .",
    "although still uncertain whether the observed antiproton spectrum is still consistent with the background of secondary antiprotons  @xcite , several studies  @xcite have attempted to explain the possible excess of antiproton using dm annihilations and/or decays .",
    "it is well - known that the excess of both electron and position fluxes require additional contributions to the thermally averaged dm annihilation cross section  @xcite than is required by the antiproton fraction spectrum . in this work ,",
    "we propose a weakly - interacting massive particle ( wimp ) dm model that readily accommodates the two sets of data .    in this work , we extend the htm by having an additional hidden @xmath0 symmetry that is broken by a scalar quadruplet down to a residual @xmath1 symmetry _ a la _ krauss - wilczek mechanism  @xcite , making the associated gauge bosons our dm candidates .",
    "the quadruplet also has interactions with both the sm doublet and the higgs triplet and plays the role of mediator that connects the hidden sector and the visible sector of sm particles and exotic higgs bosons .",
    "a model also invoking a scalar triplet field but using a singlet scalar as a cold dm candidate was proposed in ref .  @xcite . as a result",
    ", the dm can annihilate into a pair of exotic higgs bosons that in turn decay into leptons or weak gauge bosons as alluded to before .",
    "the leptonic channel will lead to production of electrons and positrons , and the gauge channel to protons and antiprotons after hadronization . with an appropriate choice of the triplet vev",
    ", the model can explain simultaneously the observed spectra of positron and antiproton fluxes .",
    "it should be emphasized that the choice of @xmath0 gauge group is just to provide an explicit model with stable dm candidates .",
    "other dm models from a hidden sector that couples mainly to the triplet higgs fields should catch the same features as well .",
    "in this model , we extend the sm gauge group by an additional @xmath0 symmetry with the associated gauge field denoted by @xmath4 .",
    "this symmetry is broken by an @xmath0 quadruplet field @xmath5 that does not carry sm gauge charges , where the subscript stands for the eigenvalue of @xmath6 , the third @xmath0 generator , of the field and @xmath7 .",
    "finally , we also introduce a complex higgs field @xmath8 that is a triplet under the sm @xmath9 and carries hypercharge @xmath10 . here",
    "we adopt the convention that the electric charge @xmath11 .",
    "more explicitly , the complete lagrangian invariant under the @xmath12 gauge group is @xmath13   \\non \\\\ & + \\left ( d_\\mu \\phi_4\\right)^\\dagger d^\\mu \\phi_4 - v(\\phi,\\delta , \\phi_4 )   - \\frac{1}{4 } x^a_{\\mu\\nu } x^{a \\mu \\nu } ~ , \\label{eq : lang}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the lagrangian of sm , @xmath15 denotes the left - handed lepton doublet field , @xmath16 is the charge conjugation , @xmath17 is the yukawa coupling matrix , @xmath18 is a higgs doublet , and the field strength tensor @xmath19 .",
    "the most general higgs potential @xmath20 where , as in the sm , @xmath21 is required for the ewsb , @xmath22 is the sm higgs doublet field , and the scalar triplet of @xmath9 is written in an @xmath23 covariant form as @xmath24 where the triplet vev @xmath25 is induced by the doublet vev through the @xmath26 term and is constrained by the electroweak rho parameter to be less than about 1 gev . in fact , to produce the right positron and antiproton spectra given by the ams-02 experiment , @xmath25 is required to be @xmath27(10 - 100 ) kev . with @xmath28 assumed to be of @xmath27(tev ) , @xmath26 is also about the same scale as @xmath25 .    to break the @xmath0 symmetry while preserving a discrete symmetry to stabilise dm candidates , we require @xmath29 so that the @xmath30 field spontaneously develops a vev in the @xmath31 component :  @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is assumed to be @xmath34 tev . as a result , the @xmath0 gauge bosons @xmath35 and",
    "@xmath36 acquire their masses , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , at the tev scale after absorbing the @xmath39 and @xmath40 as their longitudinal components .",
    "moreover , there is a residual @xmath1 symmetry in the model , under which @xmath41 and @xmath42 carry nonzero charges and serve as good candidates of dm . finally , the physical states in the hidden sector and the quadruplet are @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath36 and @xmath43 , where @xmath43 plays the role of messenger between the hidden sector and the visible sector .",
    "we now work out the relevant couplings for our analysis . from the kinetic term of @xmath30 and the breaking pattern of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vev ] ) , the gauge interaction between @xmath43 and @xmath41 is given by  @xcite @xmath44 where , as mentioned above , @xmath45(tev ) .",
    "in general , the neutral components in @xmath46 , @xmath8 , and @xmath30 can mix under the mass matrix @xmath47 in the basis of @xmath48 , where @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 . as mentioned above ,",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath25 are much smaller than the other mass parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mass ] ) . therefore , only @xmath52 and @xmath43 mix to render the mass eigenstates @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the sm - like higgs boson of mass 125 gev , @xmath46 is the other physical higgs boson with a mass at the tev scale , and the mixing angle @xmath55 given by @xmath56 is taken to be small in view of the hierarchy between @xmath57 and @xmath33 and by assuming small @xmath58 .",
    "in addition , we require @xmath59 and @xmath60 to be sufficiently small so that the mass of @xmath61 is smaller than @xmath62 . finally , we obtain the following approximate formulas for the masses of physical scalar bosons : @xmath63 in the limit of vanishing @xmath58 , @xmath64 does not couple with sm particles directly . now the only important parameter that controls the phenomenology of dm interactions with the visible sector is @xmath65 . explicitly , the @xmath65 interaction term gives @xmath66 ~. \\label{eq : hdd}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in this work , we consider the scenario where the dm particles annihilate through the @xmath67-@xmath68-@xmath46 and @xmath46-@xmath8-@xmath69 interactions given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : igg ] ) and ( [ eq : hdd ] ) , respectively , to a pair of higgs triplet bosons . to facilitate this pair annihilation process",
    ", we employ the breit - wigner enhancement through the relation @xmath70 , which affects both relic density  @xcite and positoron / antiproton fluxes  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , we have @xmath71 and @xmath72 dominantly and some small branching fractions of @xmath73 for @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , with details depending on the values of @xmath25 and the yukawa couplings @xmath77 . as a result",
    ", the model can have simultaneous productions of @xmath78 and @xmath79 , with some of the latter hadronizing into antiprotons , at significantly different rates .",
    "now the major free parameters in our analysis are @xmath80 , @xmath65 , @xmath62 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath25 , and @xmath77 . in the dm annihilation amplitude ,",
    "the gauge coupling @xmath80 and the quadruplet vev @xmath33 always appear in the combination of product and can be rewritten in terms of @xmath62 . for the mass of @xmath46 ,",
    "we write @xmath83 and use @xmath84 as one positive free parameter of @xmath85 or smaller . a breit - wigner enhancement",
    "is then obtained in the current dm annihilation rate because in the non - relativistic limit the annihilation cross section is written by @xmath86^{-1 } \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{m_\\delta^2}{m_\\chi^2 } } ~ , \\label{eq : sigmav}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 denotes the total width of @xmath46 and is found to be much smaller than @xmath62 .",
    "the average speed of dm @xmath57 in units of the speed of light is typically @xmath88 at the current universe and @xmath89 at the freeze - out . therefore , the dominant parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmav ] ) are @xmath65 , @xmath62 and @xmath84 .",
    "the yukawa couplings can be fixed by fitting to the neutrino mass measurements  @xcite and assuming the normal hierarchy as it is preferred by the positron flux excess  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we have taken the cp - violating phase , the majorana phases , and the mass of the lightest neutrino to be zero .",
    "the conclusion will not change much if , for example , we take a tiny nonzero mass for the lightest neutrino .",
    "both lepton flavour - conserving and -violating channels have been included in the decays of the triplet higgs bosons .",
    "our choice of @xmath82 at the tev scale exempts us from the constraint of the lower bound of about 400 gev on the doubly - charged higgs boson mass through the searches of like - sign dilepton channels  @xcite .",
    "otherwise , the results of our numerical analysis are not sensitive to @xmath82 as long as it is smaller than @xmath62 . in the following analysis",
    ", we take @xmath90 gev as a reference value . in the end , we are left with four independent free parameters : @xmath65 , @xmath62 , @xmath84 , and @xmath25 .",
    "we start by investigating the dm relic abundance @xmath91 given by the planck collaboration at 90% confidence level ( cl )  @xcite . in our setup , the dm annihilation cross section @xmath92 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmav ] ) .",
    "it is noted that the dm can also annihilate into a pair of sm particles ( @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , etc ) through the @xmath54-@xmath46 mixing , which is suppressed as we assume a small mixing angle @xmath55 .",
    "our numerical analysis is done by utilizing the micromegas 4.1.5 package  @xcite implemented with the model to solve the boltzmann equation for the dm relic density .     in the lower horizontal axis , as required by the observed relic density .",
    "the upper horizontal axis gives the corresponding value of @xmath65.,width=340 ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : xs ] shows the thermally averaged cross section of dm annihilation to all triplet higgs bosons , @xmath96 , at the present time for producing the right relic density .",
    "it is shown as a function of @xmath84 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : eps ] ) .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath65 are indicated in the upper horizontal axis as well .",
    "although this curve does not have a sensitive dependence on the dm mass , we will fix @xmath97 tev because of better fits to the energy spectra of positron flux and antiproton flux ratio from the cosmic rays . as seen in the plot",
    ", the cross section can reach @xmath98 @xmath99/s for @xmath100 because of the breit - wigner enhancement . in this case , the coupling @xmath101 . as shown below ,",
    "such a cross section is desirable for rendering the correct excess of the positron flux .",
    "again , using the micromegas 4.1.5 package  @xcite , we compute the positron and antiproton fluxes resulting from the decays of the charged higgs bosons in the dm annihilation final states . for the dark matter density profile ,",
    "we take the nfw model with a local halo density of @xmath102 gev/@xmath99 , a core radius of 20 kpc , and the distance from our solar system to the galactic center as @xmath103 kpc  @xcite . for charged particle propagation through the space",
    ", we consider the three schemes min , med , and max defined in ref .",
    "@xcite to have the minimum , medium , and maximum charged particle flux , respectively .",
    "the background for positron flux is provided by a fitting function given in refs .",
    "the background for antiproton flux is estimated by combining ams proton flux data  @xcite and the flux ratio @xmath104 estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite .     in the left plot and @xmath25 in the right plot .",
    "the background in the left plot is given by the purple dotted curve , and those in the right plot are given by the thin curves.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]   in the left plot and @xmath25 in the right plot .",
    "the background in the left plot is given by the purple dotted curve , and those in the right plot are given by the thin curves.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluxes ] , the left plot shows the positron flux as a function of the positron energy .",
    "the right plot shows the ratio of antiproton flux to proton flux as a function of the antiproton kinetic energy . in both plots ,",
    "we fix @xmath97 tev . qualitatively ,",
    "changing the dm mass will shift the peaks of signals horizontally .",
    "the magnitudes of signals are mainly controlled by @xmath84 for the positron flux and by @xmath25 for the antiproton flux .",
    "we take @xmath105 and @xmath106 kev , corresponding to @xmath107 , for the min scheme ( red solid curves ) ; @xmath108 and @xmath109 kev , corresponding to @xmath110 , for the med scheme ( green dashed curves ) ; and @xmath111 and @xmath112 kev , corresponding to @xmath113 , for the max scheme ( blue dash - dotted curves ) .    here",
    "we make some comments regarding the constraint on dm annihilation cross section from the @xmath114-ray flux provided from inclusive photon spectrum measurement  @xcite and @xmath114-ray observation of dwarf galaxies  @xcite by fermi - lat .",
    "although dm annihilation to four - body final states , as in our case , are generally less constrained than two - body final states , our analysis assuming the normal hierarchy of neutrino masses has @xmath115 decaying to energetic @xmath116 and @xmath117 at a branching fraction of around 30% for both modes .",
    "such @xmath118 leptons in the final states may produce @xmath114-rays subject to the fermi - lat constraint .",
    "a detailed analysis with this taken into account will be presented in another work  @xcite .    finally , we note in passing that the scattering cross section between the dm and the nucleons is small because the interactions between the dm and the sm particles is suppressed by the mixing angle @xmath55",
    ". therefore , the model can readily evade the constraints from current direct searches .",
    "in the current work , we have constructed a model based on the higgs triplet model and an additional @xmath0 gauge symmetry that links neutrino mass and dark matter physics . with an @xmath0 quadruplet that develops a vacuum expectation value in its @xmath31 component ,",
    "the @xmath0 symmetry is broken down to a discrete @xmath1 symmetry , thereby stabilising the @xmath119 components of the gauge field as the dark matter candidates .",
    "we have then analyzed the dark matter phenomenology of the model particularly in view of the recent ams-02 data . through the physical scalar boson of the quadruplet as the messenger",
    ", the dark matter particles can annihilate primarily into a pair of triplet higgs bosons , provided that the mixing between the quadruplet scalar particle and the sm - like higgs boson is sufficiently small .",
    "the correct dark matter relic abundance can be obtained when the mass of messenger is about twice that of the dark matter .",
    "the charged triplet higgs bosons in turn decay dominantly into leptonic final states to produce an excess of positrons .",
    "however , there is a small branching fraction for the charged triplet higgs bosons to decay into weak gauge bosons , part of which eventually hadronize into antiprotons . the decay pattern of the charged triplet higgs bosons is largely fixed by assuming the normal hierarchy and mass measurements of neutrinos .",
    "we have studied three charged particle propagation schemes and found the corresponding parameters of the model that fit well with the positron flux and antiproton flux ratio observed by the ams collaboration .",
    "finally , we remark that the gauged @xmath0 for stable dark matter candidates in this study is only one choice .",
    "any dm model from a hidden sector that couples mainly to the triplet higgs fields should have the same features as well .",

    "<S> we propose a dark matter explanation to simultaneously account for the excess of antiproton - to - proton and positron power spectra observed in the ams-02 experiment while having the right dark matter relic abundance and satisfying the current direct search bounds . </S>",
    "<S> we extend the higgs triplet model with a hidden gauge symmetry of @xmath0 that is broken to @xmath1 by a quadruplet scalar field , rendering the associated gauge bosons stable weakly - interacting massive particle dark matter candidates . by coupling the complex higgs triplet and the @xmath0 quadruplet , the dark matter candidates can annihilate into triplet higgs bosons each of which in turn decays into lepton or gauge boson final states . such a mechanism gives rise to correct excess of positrons and antiprotons with an appropriate choice of the triplet vacuum expectation value . </S>",
