    "the variability of the central object in the planetary nebula sh  2 - 71 was discovered by kohoutek @xcite .",

    "analysis of photometric data confirmed the basic 68-day periodic variation of the object in all passbands .",
    "application of own robust ( mikulek et al . 2003 ) pca code perish to all 4268 individual photometric observations allowed us to derive the linear ephemeris for timings of the light maxima as    @xmath2    the profile of the _ u_-lc differs from those observed in other passbands .",
    "photometric monitoring of sh  2 - 71 during the last 15 years ( 19902005 ) revealed long - term variations in its light .",
    "residuals resulting from the linear ephemeris ( 1 ) suggest a non - periodic shifts of lc as whole ( fig .",
    "further we selected the _",
    "v_-lc during three periods ( 199093 , 19992002 , 200405 ) well covered by observations ( fig .",
    "1b ) . during the 199902 period",
    "the minimum became flat from the phase 0.3 to 0.75 .",
    "in addition , a different average _ v_-magnitudes were measured during 1990 - 93 , 1999 - 2002 and 2004 - 05 .",
    "it was 13.48 , 13.59 and 13.50 , respectively .",
    "according to the binary model of the core of sh 2 - 71 ( cuesta & phillips , 1993 ) we interpret the periodic variation in the lc as due to the orbital motion of the binary components .",
    "the variability could be caused by different projection of an optically thick inner nebula due to the orbital motion .",
    "the long - term changes may be attributed to a variable mass transfer between the components .",
    "our two low - resolution spectra of the central object of sh  2 - 71 carried out at the loiano observatory with the bfosc spectrograph on 20/07/04 ( phase 0.12 ) and 07/09/04 ( phase 0.84 ) support this interpretation .",
    "they indicate strong change in the ionization conditions at these phases ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath3 suggests a superdense inner [ o iii ] nebula likewise in symbiotic binaries @xcite .",
    "we refined the average linear ephemeris of the periodic variation in all _ _ ubv__@xmath0 lcs . revealed long - term variations manifest themselves in found changes of ( i )  timing the light maxima as suggested by the o - c residuals , ( ii )  the profile of the _ v_-lc , which occasionally becomes flat for a large phase interval , and ( iii )  the variable average brightness of the nucleus .",
