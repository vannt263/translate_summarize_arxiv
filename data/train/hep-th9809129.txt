    "massless quantum electrodynamics in 1 + 1 space - time dimensions , known as the schwinger  @xcite model ( sm ) , proved to be a very fruitful example of quantum field theory .",
    "thanks to its symmetries it is a completely solvable model , and therefore it is particularly well suited for studying nonperturbative effects .",
    "one of the most important and well known observations is that , the initially massless boson , called hereafter a ` photon ' ( if one may say of ` photons ' in two dimensions ) , aquires a mass  the so called schwinger mass . as the consequence of this ,",
    "the electromagnetic potential becomes a function exponentially decreasing in space and proportional to @xmath0 posesses a first order pole at @xmath1 , with the residuum equal to @xmath2 .",
    "this is commonly known as the _ schwinger mechanism_. on the other hand , from the mathematical point of view , the nonzero photon mass results in sm from the noninvariance of the path integral fermion measure with respect to the local chiral gauge transformations  the @xmath3 group  which in turn is a reflection of the presence of anomaly in the model  @xcite .",
    "this vector meson mass generation through screening effects , is also of interest in electroweak theory , where the additional , and still unobserved , higgs field has to be introduced `` by hand '' , to ensure the simultaneous renormalizability of theory and the nonzero masses of the intermediate bosons @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "another important property of sm is the absence of the asymptotic fermionic states  @xcite .",
    "this in turn is interesting from the point of view of hadron structure investigations  @xcite , where the permanent quark confinement and asymptotic freedom of qcd , giving rise to the nonperturbative mass scale @xmath6 , as the necessary mathematical ingredient of the logarithmic fall off , also precludes the appearence of the asymptotic quark states . yet",
    "the other similarity between sm and qcd is the existence of a fermion condensate  @xcite , though this requires considering a nontrivial instanton sector .",
    "the above features of sm are also preserved in a generalization of sm , by allowing fermions to have a nonzero mass  @xcite .",
    "thanks to its full solvability , the sm , on an equal footing with other models , as for instance the thirring model  @xcite , may also be used to test various assumptions in the nonperturbative calculations in quantum field theories . as examples",
    "can serve here : i ) the postulated infrared form of the vertex function in the 4-dimensional massive electrodynamics  @xcite , applied later in the so called _ gauge technique _",
    "@xcite and other works in the context of nonperturabative solutions of qed ( for which the transverse corrections may be found in sm explicitely  @xcite ) , ii ) the renormalisation group methods  @xcite , or iii ) even the very formulation of the quantum field theory  @xcite .",
    "one should also mention in this context the generalized versions of sm , formulated on the compact manifolds as two - sphere  @xcite , or torus  @xcite instead of the flat space as well as the light - cone formulation  @xcite .",
    "although a number of papers have already been devoted to the investigation of propagators in sm , a relatively small interest , up to our knowledge , has been paid to higher order green functions  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we plan to fill up the gap with the particular interest paid to the 4-point functions .    in the following sections we show how they can systematically be found . in section",
    "[ sec : sect2 ] we consider the ward identities in the momentum space and show how the infinite set of dyson - schwinger equations can be reduced to only one , fully solvable equation .",
    "particularly simple solution is given in section  [ sec : sect2:subsec:2b2f ] for the function corresponding to `` compton scattering '' .",
    "for the 4-fermion green function we derive in section  [ sec : sect2:subsec:4f ] the integral equation which has a closed form ( it does not contain any higher green functions ) . in section  [ sec : sect3 ] we consider the same question in the coordinate space .",
    "following schwinger in the quoted work  @xcite , we find explicit solutions for both 4-point green functions : the 4-fermion and the 2-photon-2-fermion one .",
    "both of them are expressible through the known scalar factors of the fermion propagator . for the most interesting case of four fermions we use the derived formula to show that the function contains a pole at @xmath7 , i.e. corresponding to the schwinger boson .",
    "we also give a formula for the formfactor of the appropriate residue . in the appendix",
    "we give the definitions of all the green functions considered in the present work .",
    "in this section we are concentrating on the momentum space equations for the 4-point green functions .",
    "firstly , we deal with 2-fermion-2-boson function .",
    "we recapitulate ward identities which allow us to represent it as the appropriate combination of the 3-point functions . these , however , are already known and expressible , once again due to ward identities , through the full fermion propagator  @xcite .",
    "secondly , we consider 4-fermion green function . in this case",
    "the situation is much more difficult since we do not have at our disposal any identity which would permit to reduce the problem to lower functions .",
    "therefore , we consider the dyson - schwinger equation which couples the 4-point function to 5-point one ( with one boson and four fermion ` legs ' ) .",
    "next , we apply both ward identities to the latter , and in consequence obtain a selfconsistent integral equation which contains only the 4-fermion function ( and lower ones ) .",
    "sm may be defined through the two - dimensional lagrangian density @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the gauge fixing parameter . for our calculations",
    "it will be convenient to choose later the landau gauge by setting @xmath10 .",
    "for the dirac gamma matrices the following convention will be used @xmath11 and for the metric tensor @xmath12 the totally antisymmetric symbol @xmath13 is defined by @xmath14    the definitions of all the green function that appear in the formulae below are collected together in the appendix .",
    "we start this section with derivig ward identities satisfied by the relevant green function .",
    "the standard procedure in this derivation is to perform , under the functional integral  ( [ gener ] ) , the following infintesimal local gauge transformation @xmath15 and consider the resulting variational equation . doing that way we get the relation satisfied by the generating functional @xmath16 @xmath17 now we have to functionally differentiate both sides of this equation over @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 . after having put all the external currents at zero value we obtain the following equation for the 4-point green function @xmath21 , defined in the appendix , @xmath22\\ ; , \\label{a1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we omitted the obvious spinor indices . if we now make use of the well known  @xcite ward identity satisfied by the photon propagator @xmath23 which stresses that only the transverse part of @xmath24 is influenced by the interaction , and rewrite the expression in momentum space using the definitions of figure  [ mom ] , we obtain , after removing the common factors on both sides , @xmath25\\ ; .\\label{ward } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    obviously , this equation does not define @xmath21 entirely , but only its longitudinal part ( in index @xmath26 ) .",
    "fortunately , due to the vanishing electron mass the lagrangian @xmath27 is invariant also with respect to the local _ chiral _ gauge transformation . in the infinitesimal version they read @xmath28",
    "similarly as it was done to obtain  ( [ infgen1 ] ) we can derive the following equation for the generating functional @xmath29 @xmath30 one important difference in comparison with eq .",
    "( [ infgen1 ] ) , which should be noted here , is the presence of the mass equal to @xmath31 in the first term .",
    "this term results , as mentioned in the introduction , from the noninvariance of the path integral measure with respect to the group of transformations  ( [ gauge1 ] ) and constitutes the well known chiral anomaly  @xcite . following the same way as above , and using the chiral version of equation  ( [ wardphot1 ] ) @xmath32 we get in momentum space @xmath33\\ ;   .\\label{wardchir } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this , together with  ( [ ward ] ) , determines uniquely @xmath21 because in two dimensions there are only two independent space - time 2-vectors .",
    "therefore we can write @xmath34 and in consequence , any tensor @xmath35 may be written as @xmath36 applying this to the 4-point function @xmath21 , we find @xmath37\\ ; .",

    "( [ g2mn ] ) we see that the 4-point function is entirely expressible through 2-point functions which are already known . in the same way one can reduce to fermion propagators , by successively applying both ward identities , any green function with two fermion and @xmath43 boson ` legs ' .",
    "a different approach one has to make use of while dealing with functions with more than two fermions , since only the photon ` legs ' may be removed the above way .",
    "we consider this question in the following paragraph .    the simple structure of @xmath44 reflects the fact that in the schwinger model the external photons ( i.e. nonperturbative , massive photons ) are always coupled directly to the electron line , without an intermediate fermion loop , since any loop with more than two external photons turns out to be zero , if we consider all possible permutations of vertices .      in the case of the 4-fermion",
    "function the exploiting of the ordinary , and the chiral ward identity does not solve the problem completely ( although it is still very useful ) , since we can not reduce fermion legs , in any way .",
    "however , we are able to obtain a selfconsistent equation for this function . to do so we start from the dyson - schwinger equation for the 4-fermion function which can be derived in a standard way .",

    "the result is @xmath54 a schematical representation of this equation is shown on figure  [ dys4 ] .",
    "there the thick lines correspond to full propagators and thin lines to the free ones .",
    "this equation indicates that the 4-point function depends on the 5-point one which is , of course , the typical behaviour of the set of dyson - schwinger equations , since the interacting lagrangian contains always terms of at least third order in fields , resulting in an infinite interlacement of green functions .",

    "below we would like to recapitulate the results we obtained in the present work . at first , in section",
    "[ sec : sect2 ] , we considered ward identities in momentun space satisfied by the 4- and 5-point green functions .",
    "thanks to the local chiral symmetry of the lagrangian , apart from the ordinary gauge invariance , we derived two identities . in the 2-dimensional world",
    "these two identities suffice to entirely describe the considered green function , and express it through lower ones .",
    "each application of these identities allows us to reduce the number of external photons by one .",
    "following that way we were able to reduce the 2-boson-2-fermion function to well known electron propagator . in the case of 4-fermion function",
    "the situation turned out to be much more severe since we have no photon legs to reduce .",
    "the alternative approach was , therefore , introduced in section  [ sec : sect2:subsec:4f ] .",
    "the starting point was here the dyson - schwinger equation which , on one hand , introduces 5-point function , but on the other permits to reduce it to the function we are looking for .",
    "this leads to a selfconsistent integral equation which contains apart from the unknown function only propagators which are perfectly known .",
    "we were , unfortunately , unable to solve this integral equation because of its complicated mathematical character , which is not unexpected since in the schwinger model even the fermion propagator can not be given an explicit form in momentum space .",
    "the selfconsistent equation obtained in this section may , however , be a starting point for an analysis in momentum space constituting an alternative for taking the six - variable ( two integrations may be separated out to give the dirac delta function ) fourier transform .",
    "in section  [ sec : sect3 ] we considered the same functions in coordinate space .",
    "we used the generating functional which had already been found in the original schwinger s work  @xcite .",
    "the green functions are , of course , given as the appropriate derivatives of this functional over the external currents .",
    "the problem which one only has to take care of is the tensor structure of the functions .",
    "the final compact expressions for the all 4-point functions were found and are shown to be expressible through the fermion propagator .",
    "all the methods of this , as well as of preceding section , may easily be generalized to any higher green functions .",
    "for the most interesting case  the 4-fermion function  we were able to show that  ( [ fin4f ] ) contains a pole , in the fermion - antifermion channel , corresponding to the schwinger boson .",
    "it is interesting to note that the formfactor in the residue of the pole turns out to be normalisable in the 1-space direction if we set the relative time to zero .",
    "however , we do not treat this observation as any `` proof '' that the schwinger boson is a `` bound electron - positron state '' , as is here and there suggested  @xcite .",
