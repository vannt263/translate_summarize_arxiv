    "in this paper we study a generalization of the metric dimension problem , which is a problem of finding a landmark set or a resolving set of a graph @xcite .",
    "a landmark set is a subset of vertices @xmath4 of an undirected graph @xmath7 , such that for any @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) , there exists @xmath10 with @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the number of edges in a shortest path between @xmath13 and @xmath14 . in this case , @xmath1 is called a separating vertex for @xmath2 and @xmath3 . alternatively , it is equivalent to require for @xmath6 to have a separating vertex for every pair @xmath15 .",
    "this problem was introduced by harary and melter @xcite and by slater @xcite .",
    "the problem was studied in the combinatorics literature @xcite , with respect to complexity @xcite , and with respect to design of polynomial time algorithms for certain graph classes ( sometimes even for the weighted version ) , and in particular for paths and trees @xcite .",

    "if this is required for every @xmath18 , the model is called ap ( all - pairs model ) ( introduced in @xcite and independently in @xcite ) , and if this is required for every @xmath19 , the model is called nl ( non - landmarks model ) , which was introduced in @xcite . in all cases , a valid solution",
    "is called a landmark set . in the weighted case ,",
    "a non - negative rational cost is given for each vertex by a function @xmath20 .",
    "for a set @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the total cost of vertices in @xmath23 , and the goal is to find a landmark set @xmath6 with the minimum value @xmath24 . for a given graph , the minimum cardinality of any landmark set",
    "is called the @xmath16-metric dimension , while the minimum cost of any set is called the weighted @xmath16-metric dimension .",
    "yero , estrada - moreno , and rodrguez - velzquez @xcite showed that computing the @xmath16 metric dimension of an arbitrary graph is np - hard .",

    "let @xmath0 be a tree graph .",
    "let @xmath27 be the number of @xmath28 s vertices .",
    "the case of a path graph was completely analyzed in @xcite ( for all values of @xmath16 and the two models , see also @xcite for the all - pairs model ) , and therefore we will assume that @xmath28 has at least one vertex of degree greater than @xmath29 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that a minimal cost landmark set for a path graph and @xmath25 consists of two or three vertices .",
    "note that ( by definition ) every solution for ap is a solution for nl .",
    "any subset of three vertices of a path form a landmark set ( for each of the models ) , the two endpoints of the path also for a landmark set for both models .",
    "however , a solution consisting of the first two vertices of the path or the last two vertices of the path are landmark sets for nl but not for ap . for the case @xmath30 , trees were studied in @xcite .    given a tree , a vertex of degree at least @xmath31 is called a core vertex or a _ core_. a vertex of degree @xmath29 is called a path vertex , and a vertex of degree @xmath32 is called a leaf .",
    "as paths were completely studied in @xcite , we will consider trees that have at least one core .",
    "for a core @xmath3 , we often consider the subtrees creating by removing @xmath3 from the tree , and call them the subtrees of its neighbors ( one subtree for each neighbor ) .",
    "we sometimes consider the bfs tree that is created by rooting the tree at @xmath3 .",
    "a subtree of a neighbor of a core @xmath3 that is a path ( without any cores ) is called a leg ( or a standard leg ) of @xmath3 . if a leg consists of a single vertex ( that is , @xmath3 is connected to a leaf ) , we called it a short leg , and otherwise it is called a long leg . for a leg @xmath33 of @xmath3",
    "which consists of @xmath34 vertices , the vertex of position @xmath35 , also denoted by @xmath36 ( for @xmath37 ) , is the vertex of the leg @xmath33 whose distance from @xmath3 is @xmath35 . khuller et al .",
    "@xcite showed that a landmark set for @xmath30 can be created by selecting all leaves except for the leaf of one leg of each core . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that a minimum cost landmark set is created by selecting one vertex of each leg of a core except for one leg , such that the selected vertices have total minimal cost .",
    "given a tree , we define a _ small core _ to be a core vertex that satisfies all the following conditions ; the core has a degree of exactly @xmath31 , it has at least two legs , one of which is a short leg . the second leg of a small core may be either short or long , and the third subtree of a neighbor of @xmath3 can be a ( short or long ) leg or it can contain one or more cores .",
    "other cores are called regular cores .",
    "if the third subtree of a neighbor of @xmath3 contains a core , the closest core to @xmath3 , @xmath13 , is connected to @xmath3 by a path consisting of path vertices . for a small core @xmath3 ,",
    "if the closest core , @xmath13 , is a small core too , then since @xmath13 also has two legs ( in addition to the subtree of a neighbor of @xmath13 that contains @xmath3 ) , the tree has exactly two ( small ) cores and no regular cores ( while in any other case , @xmath13 is a regular core ) .",
    "we will have two special cases .",
    "one special case is where the tree contains exactly two small cores ( and no regular cores ) .",
    "the other special case is where the tree has exactly one small core ( and no regular cores , that is , the tree consists of a core with three legs , at least one of which is short ) . the two special cases will be considered separately after some properties will be discussed , while all cases where the tree has at least one regular core will be treated together .",
    "next , we define a _ modified leg_. for a core vertex @xmath3 , a subtree of a neighbor of @xmath3 that has exactly one core , and",
    "this core is a small core , is called a modified leg ( in this case @xmath3 is the closest regular core to at least one small core ) .",
    "that is , a modified leg of @xmath3 consists of a path to a small core , a small core , and the standard legs of the small core ( where the small core has one short leg and one leg that is short or long ) .",
    "a g - leg of a core @xmath3 is a subtree of a neighbor of @xmath3 that is either a standard leg ( short or long ) or a modified leg ( the terms short leg and long leg will refer only to standard legs ) . a position on a modified leg @xmath33 is defined exactly as it is defined for a standard leg , but if the small core ( which is part of @xmath33 ) is in position @xmath38 , then there are two vertices with position @xmath39 on @xmath33 , denoted by @xmath40 and @xmath41 , where @xmath41 is the unique vertex of a short leg of the small core ( if both its standard legs are short , the choice of which vertex of a short leg is @xmath40 and which one is @xmath41 is done arbitrarily ) . as explained above , except for the special case treated later , if a small core @xmath2 that belongs to a modified leg of @xmath3 , then @xmath3 is a regular core .",
    "a regular core is called minor if one of the two following conditions holds .",
    "the first condition is that it has at most one g - leg ( as its degree is at least @xmath31 , there are at least two other subtrees of its neighbors that are neither standard legs nor modified legs , and each such subtree contains a regular core ) .",
    "the second condition is that its degree is at least @xmath42 , it has no modified legs , it has exactly two standard legs , one of which is short ( the other leg is either short or long ) and the other ( at least two ) subtrees of its neighbors are not g - legs and contain regular cores .",
    "thus , for a minor core @xmath3 , no matter which condition out of the two is satisfied , there are always at least two subtrees of the neighbors of @xmath3 which are not g - legs , and it either has at most one g - leg ( which is standard or modified ) , or it has two standard legs , at least one of which is short . if a regular core is not minor , then we call it a",

    "the condition for a set @xmath44 to be a landmark set is defined on the sets of legs of cores .",
    "for each core , if there is a leg that does not have any vertex in @xmath6 , any other leg must have at least two vertices in @xmath6 .",
