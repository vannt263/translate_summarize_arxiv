    "sonoluminescence refers to the phenomenon of light emission during acoustic radiation of a liquid and is associated with cavitation bubbles present in the liquid .",
    "the most controllable and promising experimental data were obtained for single bubble sonoluminescence ( sbsl ) : picosecond uv radiation of a single bubble pulsating in the field of the sound wave @xcite .",
    "though the case of a single pulsating bubble is , of course , much simpler than cavitation in general , it turns out that the sbsl is a very complex phenomenon which still remains not completely understood .",
    "there is a vast literature devoted to sbsl that was recently reviewed in ref.@xcite .",
    "interest in this phenomenon is stimulated , on the one hand , by the fact that in relatively simple and controllable experiments extraordinary conditions ( ultra - high pressures , temperatures , and ultra - short light flashes ) are realized at the final stage of the bubble collapse ; on the other hand , it looks promising to use the sbsl to construct a source of ultraviolet ultra - short flashes that is much cheaper than lasers .    the highly involved hydrodynamics of bubble collapse has been addressed in many papers that are reviewed in ref .",
    "one of the most important problems to explain here is the very existence of stable pulsation of bubbles .",
    "recently a theory has been developed @xcite which explains this regime in terms of the dissolved gas diffusion and chemical reactions in the gas within the bubble .",
    "it has been shown that an accumulation of noble gas in the bubble takes place during pulsation of the bubble and that in a stable situation the gas in the bubble consists , almost entirely , of noble gas and , of course , of water vapor .",
    "these theoretical conclusions were supported by the experimental data of ref.@xcite .",
    "another key problem in sbsl is the mechanism of the light emission .",
    "many mechanisms have been proposed , criticized , and reviewed to explain uv flashes radiated by the collapsing bubble @xcite .",
    "the most popular of the suggested mechanisms are the adiabatic heating of the bubble gas @xcite , shock wave - bremsstrahlung model @xcite , and , recently proposed proton - tunneling radiation as a result of a phase transition in water at ultra - high pressure @xcite .",
    "a general feature of these mechanisms is that extraordinary conditions are needed which can only be realized , if at all , at a very small bubble radius when the density of the bubble gas is close to the water density and both the hydrodynamics of the bubble and the properties of the bubble content and the neighboring liquid are not known from experiment but inferred from numerical simulations .    in this paper",
    "we show that the main characteristic features of sbsl can be explained even without making any assumptions about the extraordinary conditions .",
    "we are far from saying that these extraordinary conditions are not present in experiments .",
    "what we mean is that there is another mechanism of the sbsl which occurs in water near the bubble surface but not in the bubble gas as has been assumed in the most popular models of sbsl @xcite .",
    "extraordinary conditions are not necessary for the operation of this mechanism even though it may well be the main cause of uv radiation .",
    "the mechanism under consideration is based on the idea put forward in ref.@xcite that sbsl occurs because of electric breakdown in strong electric fields arising near the bubble surface as a result of flexoelectric effect , that is the effect of polarization of water because of gradients of pressure @xcite . here",
    "we present a scenario and estimations that show that within the hypothesis the main features of sbsl can be explained using relatively moderate parameters , e.g. , temperatures ( 5@xmath010)10@xmath1k for the bubble gas @xcite , and the natural ( expected ) value of the flexoelectric coefficient of water @xcite .",
    "let us mention that ref.@xcite has left many questions to answer .",
    "the origin of the optical radiation of the bubble remaines unexplained .",
    "the problem is that in the visible region pure water has very low levels of absorbtion and radiation due to interband optical transition @xcite .",
    "moreover the breakdown scenario is far from being clear .",
    "the mechanism of the breakdown in water ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) involves  lucky electrons  whose acceleration in the electric field leads to development of an avalanche . at ambient temperature",
    "the concentration of free electrons in water is quite negligible ( the band gap is about 6.5 ev @xcite ) and it is impossible to find a ",
    "lucky electron  in a small volume near the bubble surface , i.e. in the region of high electric field , during the short time of the existence of this field .",
    "the spectacular synchronization of the emission pulses @xcite that in the case of breakdown appears , at least at first sight , to be hardly compatible with the fact that we are dealing with a probabilistic situation .",
    "in addition , the reference to the penning effect to explain the role of the noble gases is not convincing because the ionization energy of the metastable state is more than the band gap of water as distinct from the case of breakdown in gases where the penning effect is pronounced .    in this paper",
    "we consider in more detail possible processes associated with the electric field arising from the flexoelectric effect near a bubble exhibiting sbsl .",
    "a common difficulty with theories of sbsl is that little is known about the parameters of gas in the bubble when the bubble radius is near its minimum value .",
    "consensus exists about one point : it is far from being a gas , because the lowest limit of the radius is governed by the van der waals repulsion and the minimum volume of the bubble is close to the van der waals hard core volume .",
    "the equations of state used for these conditions are not reliable at present .",
    "this is a challenging and fundamental problem but it is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "what is now possible is to make order - of - magnitude estimations .",
    "that is why we shall first explain what values of relevant parameters are necessary for our scenario to be operative and then discuss whether our assumptions about these parameters are realistic .",
    "we include the value of the flexoelectric coefficient of water among these parameters as well .",
    "this coefficient has not been measured , unfortunately , and we use its estimated  natural  value but , from the other hand , the knowledge of its precise value would hardly be of decisive importance because the bubble gas parameters are not known precisely .",
    "let us describe shortly the proposed scenario .",
    "at certain short time interval , @xmath2ns , when the bubble radius is near its minimum , the acceleration of the radius and , therefore , the pressure gradient , assume gigantic values @xcite and the sign of the pressure gradient is such as to create a strong ( depolarizing ) electric field directed to the centre of the bubble in a thin water layer , @xmath3 , near the bubble surface , because of the flexoelctric effect .",
    "what happens then is , in effect , screening of this depolarizing field by free electrons .",
    "indeed , during the same time interval the temperature of the gas sharply increases up to at least several thousand k , which owing to thermal excitation of the bubble gas and water in a thin layer near the bubble surface makes the concentration of free electrons appreciable .",
    "the free electrons are accelerated by the strong  flexoelectric  field up to energies sufficient to generate additional free electrons as a result of the electric breakdown of water .",
    "the hot electrons also collide with noble gas atoms dissolved in water and transfer them to higher energy excited states .",
    "optical transitions from these states produce light radiation with a broad spectrum whose shape is determined mainly by the energy distribution of the hot electrons .",
    "the latter has the form of a maxwell distribution with an effective electron temperature which can be very high .",
    "this is due to the fact that the noble gas atoms have a huge number of excited states with very high probabilities of optical transitions between them ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since the radiation occurs in the region of very strong and inhomogeneous electric fields the observed radiation spectrum is featureless .",
    "the characteristic time of the electric breakdown is much less than the characteristic time for the last stage of the collapse @xmath4 , i.e. the polarization can continue to change after the first breakdown and the electric field can reach the breakdown threshold value more than once . as a result , several breakdowns can take place during the time interval @xmath4 . during each breakdown",
    "the noble gas atoms are excited .",
    "an important specific feature of the noble gas atoms is the existence of long - living ( metastable ) excited states with a life time of up to several milliseconds ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , once excited the noble gas atom can remain in the metastable state for the entire time interval @xmath2ns , and , possibly , for many periods of the acoustic wave ( the period is about @xmath5s ) .",
    "that means that in the stationary state the longer is the pulse the more is its intensity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec.2",
    "we discuss the flexoelectric effect in water in more detail than in @xcite and consider the sign of the flexoelectric field , which is crucial for the proposed scenario , at different stages of the bubble collapse .",
    "the scenario of sbsl is presented in sec.3 where the values of relevant parameters necessary for realizing the scenario are estimated . in sec.4",
    "we discuss the energy distribution functions of hot electrons and the breakdown conditions in strong flexoelectric fields as well as the spectrum of sbsl . in conclusions",
    "we summarize the results of our theory , discuss their relation to the experimental data , speculate about some possible modifications of the scenario and point out some problems to solve .",
    "we have already mentioned that the proposed mechanism of sbsl is based on the flexoelectric effect , namely the appearance of a polarization ( electric field ) due to gradient of density ( pressure)@xcite . this effect is not widely known and it was discussed in @xcite but shortly . besides , the flexoelectric coeficients are still not determined experimentally@xcite .",
    "that is why we think it is worthwhile considering in more detail the appearance of electric field due to flexoelectric effect .",
    "the flexoelectric effect is a particular case of a more general phenomenon : appearance of electrical polarization , @xmath6as a result of gradient of some scalar quantity , e.g. , temperature , concentration of a component , mass density , @xmath7 .",
    "this effect should take place in any substance @xcite . as usual ,",
    "the material equation can be written in several forms .",
    "in particular , considering polarization as a function of dilatation , @xmath8 , and the electric field , @xmath9 , one has for an isotropic medium @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the electric susceptibility and @xmath12 is one of the flexoelectric coefficients",
    ". we shall be interested in the case of spherical symmetry and the absence of free charges . in this case",
    "@xmath13 then from eq.[polar ] it follows that    @xmath14    since @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the ( excess ) pressure , @xmath17 is the compressibility .    to estimate the flexoelectric coefficients it is convenient to consider separately two main mechanisms of polarization : charge displacement and dipole ordering .",
    "we shall see that in both cases the coefficient of proportionality between polarization and gradient of pressure , @xmath18 , has the same characteristic value .",
    "the charge displacement polarization is realized , e.g. , in ionic crystals .",
    "when a gradient of dilatation takes place there are less and more compressed regions in each unit cell .",
    "the ions of larger radius tend to displace to the less compressed region while ions of less radius displace into the opposite direction .",
    "since cations and anions usually have different radii their displacements produce polarization .",
    "the coefficient @xmath12 can be estimated as follows @xcite .",
    "the maximum (  atomic  ) gradient of dilatation is equal to @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the interatomic distance.this gradient has to produce  atomic ",
    "polarization @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the electron charge , when the electric field is absent ( compensated by some charges ) , i.e. @xmath23 . then from eq.[el ] it follows that    @xmath24    where we have taken into account that @xmath25 for ionic crystals .",
    "we shall argue that the same estimation is aplicable for materials with dipole ordering .",
    "the dipole ordering polarization in the absence of an external electric field but under a gradient of pressure arises because of geometric asymmetry of the molecular dipoles .",
    "for example , the geometric shape of water molecule is highly asymmetric : the negatively charged end is much more compact than the positive one : the negative charge is concentrated in the oxygen ion ( o@xmath26 ) while the positive charge is shared by two hydrogen ions ( h@xmath27 ) located fairly far from each other . under a pressure gradient",
    "a water molecule tries to orient itself in such a way that the oxygen ion would be located in the region of higher density while the hydrogens would be located in the region of lesser density .",
    "in other words , a gradient of pressure leads to orientation of the water molecular dipoles .",
    "it is well known that polarization due to dipole ordering is much more effective than polarization due to charge displacements .",
    "this is reflected in the fact that dielectric constants of dipolar materials are , normally , much larger than of non - polar materials .",
    "for the same reason it is natural to estimate @xmath28 .",
    "then from eq.[el ] it follows that for water    @xmath29    where we have taken into accout that for water @xmath30 @xmath31 .    for what follows",
    "the sign of the flexoelectric coefficients is of importance .",
    "as it has been mentioned above the negative tip of the water molecule , the oxygen ion , tends to be located in the region of higher pressure .",
    "this means that the polarization vector is directed opposite to the gradient of pressure , i.e. , the flexoelectric coefficient @xmath12 is negative and the coefficient @xmath18 is positive .",
    "let us mention that we rather underestimated the flexoelectric coefficient of water than overestimated .",
    "indeed , what we call @xmath32 is replaced , in fact , by @xmath33 defining an  atomic ",
    "flexoelectric coefficient that is of the same order of magnitude for all substances , i.e. it does not take into account specific features of the substance in question .",
    "it is natural to expect that a substance consisting of molecules whose electric asymmetry ( existence of a dipolar moment ) is accompanied by a pronounced geometric asymmetry ( as it is for water ) will exhibit a stronger flexoelectric effect than that estimated above .",
    "however , while this coefficient is not measured ( reliable calculations seem much more problematic than measurements ) we shall assume the value given by eq.[flex ] .",
    "on the contrary , the conclusion reached about the sign of the coefficient @xmath18 , which is crucial for the mechanism discussed in this paper , seems much more definite .",
    "above we have neglected the conductivity of water .",
    "this may seem questionable because the debye radius of the electric field screening in water is comparable with the characteristic size of the strong field region ( @xmath34 m ) .",
    "however , this neglection is justified because , as a rule , the dielectric relaxation time , @xmath35 is much greater than @xmath36ns , which is the maximal characteristic time of the polarization change in our case . increasing the ionic conductivity of water by adding , for example , nacl",
    ", one can , according to our estimations , decrease @xmath37 down to 0.1ns .",
    "in such an electrolyte the mechanism of sbsl discussed in this paper might be less effective .",
    "the dynamics of bubble cavitation have been studied in many papers @xcite . here",
    "we will only discuss the short time interval when the bubble radius @xmath38 is close to its minimum value @xmath39 ( fig.1a ) .",
    "fig.1a reflects the most essential features of fig.4 of ref.@xcite and fig.12 of ref.@xcite where experimental results were presented . within this interval the velocity of the bubble surface @xmath40 reaches its maximum and reaches zero at the point @xmath41 ( fig.1b ) and the acceleration @xmath42 reverses its sign and can achieve huge values ( fig.1c ) . during the negative acceleration period ( @xmath43 ,",
    "1c ) the gradient of pressure @xmath44 is directed from the bubble center to its periphery , thus according to eq.[flex ] the flexoelectric depolarizing field has the same direction ( fig.1d ) .",
    "that means that free electrons that could be generated in the gas or in water near the bubble surface can not be accelerated . during the positive acceleration period ( @xmath45 ,",
    "1e ) the situation is opposite : the arising flexoelectric field is directed to the bubble center and the generated electrons can be accelerated by the field and produce a breakdown ( fig .",
    "according to experimental data @xcite for a bright sbsl the characteristic value of the acceleration is about ( 10@xmath46 @xmath47 m / s@xmath48 during an interval , @xmath49 1ns , so the pressure gradient @xmath44 can reach ( 10@xmath5010@xmath51n / m@xmath52 . note that the gradient of pressure decays with distance from the bubble surface . for purpose of estimations one can consider water as incompressible liquid where @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the gradient of pressure at the bubble surface .",
    "the same estimation for the gradient of pressure can be obtained if we take into account that the pressure is about ( 10@xmath5510@xmath56 ) n / m@xmath48 at the final stage of the bubble collapse and the extension of the high pressure region is about 1@xmath57 m @xcite .",
    "it follows from eqs.[flex ] and [ el ] that for @xmath58=(10@xmath5910@xmath51n / m@xmath1 the value of the flexoelectric field , @xmath60 can reach ( 10@xmath61 10@xmath62v / m . according to eq.[flex ] the electric field decays just as the gradient of pressure , i.e. , the flexoelectric field in water is given by the formula @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the field at the bubble surface , i.e. the radial extension of the strong field region is about 1@xmath57 m .",
    "the field @xmath65 can essentially exceed the threshold field of dynamic electric breakdown of water @xmath66 which is about ( 1@xmath03)@xmath6710@xmath56v / m@xcite .",
    "it does not mean , however , that electric breakdown will occur : a  lucky electron  which capable of provoking an avalanche is needed .",
    "a similar situation takes place with the laser breakdown @xcite . at the same time",
    "the conduction electron concentration , @xmath68 in water at room temperature is practically zero ( @xmath69@xmath70 ) : water could be considered as a wide gap amorphous semiconductor with @xmath71ev @xcite .",
    "the breakdown starts only the moment when the strong flexoelectric field is directed to the bubble center ( fig .",
    "1f ) and conduction electrons appear because of the sharp increase of temperature near the bubble surface .",
    "the latter takes place when the bubble radius @xmath72 which is close to @xmath73(0.5@xmath01)@xmath57 . at this moment",
    "the flexoelectric field @xmath74 may be much more greater than @xmath66 so the coefficient of avalanche multiplication of an electron can be practically infinite and in this case just several electrons are enough to provoke the breakdown and to screen the field .",
    "let us show that even relatively moderate temperatures near the bubble surface ( which seem to be generally acceptable for the regimes without the shock waves ) are quite sufficient to provide a sufficient number of conduction electrons to ensure the breakdown .",
    "as in ref .",
    "@xcite we assume that the gas has the temperature of 7000k .",
    "that means that the water layer with a thickness of the thermal penetration length , @xmath75 , has a temperature of about 3000k . for @xmath75",
    "one has :    @xmath76    where @xmath77 , the thermal conductivity of water is about 0.4 j / m s k ; @xmath78 , the specific heat , is about 4@xmath79 j / m@xmath1 k ; @xmath7 , the density , is 10@xmath1kg / m@xmath1 . bearing in mind that the characteristic time for the last stage of the collapse is @xmath801ns @xcite",
    ", one finds that the thermal penetration length is @xmath81 m .",
    "following @xcite we will consider water as an amorphous semiconductor with a band gap @xmath71ev and an effective density of states @xmath82 @xmath83 for @xmath84k .",
    "the equilibrium concentration of conduction electrons in water at @xmath85k is @xmath86@xmath70 .",
    "taking into account that the volume of the hot surface layer is approximately @xmath87cm@xmath1 we find that the equilibrium number of conduction electrons in the layer is @xmath89 it is important also to find the time needed for the equilibrium concentration of electrons to be established .",
    "the thermal ionization frequency ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) is    @xmath90    where @xmath91 is the cross - section of the free carrier recombination , @xmath92 is the thermal velocity of conduction electrons in water . taking into account that a reasonable value of @xmath91 is about 10@xmath93@xmath94 and @xmath95cm / s we find from eq.[thermo ] that for @xmath96k the transient time to the equilibrium @xmath97s . from that",
    "follows that during the characteristic time for the last stage of the bubble collapse @xmath801ns the number of conduction electrons in the layer , @xmath98 exceeds @xmath99 electrons , which is quite enough to provoke breakdown .",
    "note that a similar number of free electrons can be generated by thermal ionization of the gas .",
    "indeed , the assumed gas temperature ( 7000k ) is about two times larger and the ionization energy both of the water vapor and ar , kr , xe is about 12@xmath016ev , i.e. also about two times larger than @xmath100 .",
    "authors of many works ( see @xcite and the references therein ) state that much higher temperatures can be reached because of shock waves forming in the bubble gas during the collapse . in principle",
    ", one can imagine a situation where high temperatures are not reached ( and free electrons are not generated ) before the shock waves are formed . in this case",
    "the shock wave , when it explodes , will start the electric breakdown .    as a result of breakdown",
    "the depolarizing flexoelectric field becomes screened .",
    "the total transmitted charge in the process of the screening is    @xmath101    where we have taken into account that in our case @xmath102 , i.e. , @xmath103 . assuming @xmath104 m and @xmath105 v / m we find that the maximum total number of transmitted electrons is @xmath106 .",
    "note that for considered electric fields the time of the screening ( breakdown ) , @xmath107 , is determined by the time it takes for the conduction electrons to cross the region of the strong electric field whose size is @xmath108 .",
    "thus @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the electron drift velocity which in strong electric fields saturates at some value @xmath111 m/s ( see sec.4 ) . assuming @xmath112",
    "m we find @xmath113ps .",
    "note that the value of @xmath107 is less than the observed sbsl pulse width @xcite .",
    "the whole period of positive acceleration , @xmath4 , ( see sec.3 ) is about two orders of magnitude larger than @xmath114 therefore , after the breakdown is finished and the depolarization field is screened the polarization continues to change , because of change in acceleration .",
    "the electric field arises once more and can exceed the breakdown threshold . as a result",
    "a new breakdown will take place .",
    "such a situation can be repeated several times .",
    "effectively , it manifests itself in an increase of the pulse duration which may achieve a fraction of a nanosecond .",
    "therefore , within our scenario the greater is the pulse duration the greater is its energy .",
    "analogous interrelation is observed in experiment . @xcite .",
    "we have already mentioned that the electric fields under consideration are very strong , inhomogeneous and change over time",
    ". however , the characteristic space and time scales of the field change are correspondingly @xmath112 m and @xmath2ns and they are much more than the relaxation length @xmath115 and relaxation time @xmath116 of the hot electron energy which are respectively about @xmath117 and @xmath118s .",
    "therefore one can consider the local electron energy distribution function using well known results for homogeneous static electric fields @xcite .",
    "the considered electric fields are superstrong , i.e. the following condition is valid :    @xmath119    where @xmath120 is the characteristic energy of local oscillations in water which is practically equal to the energy of optical phonons in ice , @xmath121mev @xcite . using @xmath122",
    "@xmath117 one sees that the condition [ cond1 ] is satisfied for fields @xmath123v / m .",
    "the condition [ cond1 ] means that in these fields an electron acquires , on average , an energy @xmath124 which is much more than @xmath120 . since in the process of the acceleration",
    "an electron generates many phonons the electron energy distribution is nearly isotropic in the momentum space .",
    "specifically , in this case the energy distribution of hot conduction electrons is approximated with high accuracy , up to energies of electrical breakdown @xmath125 , by the maxwell function @xcite :    @xmath126    with an effective electron temperature @xmath127 which is determined by the balance equations for energy and momentum of the hot electrons @xmath128",
    "@xmath129    where @xmath130 is the effective thermal velocity of electrons . since for the maxwell distribution    @xmath131    from eqs.[bal1 ]",

    "[ cond1 ] one sees that @xmath134 this is precisely the condition of validity for the thermalization of the hot electrons and use of the maxwell distribution .",
    "conduction electrons in water form polarons which are conventionally called hydrated electrons @xcite .",
    "however , in the strong electric field the polaron states decay and the current carriers are the usual conduction electrons . for purpose of estimation",
    "we assume that their effective mass @xmath135 is close to that of free electrons @xmath136 .",
    "then from eq.[vel - dr ] it follows that @xmath111 m/s for @xmath137mev .",
    "it has already been mentioned that the electric fields under consideration are @xmath138v / m .",
    "it follows from eq.[temp - el ] that for such fields @xmath139ev , i.e. , @xmath140k for @xmath141 .",
    "one sees that the electron temperatures can be several orders higher than the gas temperature in the bubble .",
    "recall that for our scenario ( see sec.3 ) it sufficient that the gas temperature be about 7000k .",
    "now we will discuss the role of noble gases dissolved in water .",
    "an important feature of an noble gas atom is the existence of metastable states .",
    "the life time of the metastable states can reach several milliseconds when the noble gas atoms are impurities in solids ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . since the nearest order in water is essentially the same as in solids it would be natural to expect that the life - time of the metastable states for the noble gas atoms in water is not less than @xmath142ns .",
    "hot electrons not only generate new conduction electrons ( the breakdown avalanche ) but also excite the noble gas atoms into metastable states .",
    "below we will estimate from the experimental data that the characteristic value of @xmath143ev .",
    "however , a considerable number of electrons may have energies about 10ev and can excite the noble gas atoms .",
    "note that the energies necessary for excitation to the metastable states , @xmath144 , for xe , kr , ar , ne , he are about 10ev and increase monotonically from xe to he . in other words , it is much easier to excite xe , kr and ar than ne and he .",
    "this could be the reason for the increase in sbsl intensity in the series he - xe , which has been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "as we have mentioned above , the life - time of the metastable states of noble gas atoms in water is expected to be fairly long .",
    "thus , once excited a noble gas atom can remain in a metastable state for the entire time interval of positive acceleration and multiple breakdowns , @xmath2ns .",
    "the major part of electrons has the energies @xmath145they collide with these metastable atoms and transfer them to higher excited states .",
    "the radiation transitions between high - energy excited states of noble gas atoms govern the sbsl spectrum .",
    "note that the life - time of the metastable states can exceed the period of the acoustic wave . in this case",
    "there will be an effect of accumulation of the noble gas atoms in metastable states resulting in the gradual build up of the sbsl power during several periods of the acoustic wave .",
    "a specific feature of a noble gas is an abundance of excited states with energies higher than those of metastable states and with high probabilities of the radiation transitions between them .",
    "that is why the optical spectra of the noble gas atoms contain many lines @xcite .",
    "because of the stark effect in the strong electric field these lines are split . besides , in the active region the strong electric field changes at least several times and the observed radiation spectrum is a superposition of the spectra of the atoms in different strong electric fields . in other words",
    "one can consider the density of the atomic excited states as a constant .    the probability of a hot electron having an energy @xmath146 is given by eq.[distr ] and at every collision it transfers the noble gas atom in a metastable state to a state with energy @xmath147 , the reference point of energy being the energy of the metastable state ( for our estimations we consider only one metastable state ) .",
    "the concentration of atoms excited during the time of a single electric breakdown , i.e. the screening time , @xmath148 to energies within an interval @xmath149 reads    @xmath150    where @xmath151 is the number of the noble gas atoms in the metastable state , @xmath152 is the cross section of the impact excitation of an atom from the metastable state to a state with energy @xmath147 .",
    "atoms excited to states with the energy @xmath147 generally do not go to the ground state directly but through intermediate excited states .",
    "it reasonable to assume that with a high probability they radiate phonons with energy @xmath153 .",
    "so the spectral density of the sbsl radiation energy per pulse for unit volume can be written as    @xmath154    where @xmath155 is the probability of the spontaneous radiation transition .",
    "taking into account that @xmath156 where @xmath157 is modulus of matrix element of the dipole moment of the transition @xcite we find    @xmath158    recall that @xmath127 in eq .",
    "[ spectrn ] is a function of the coordenates because @xmath159 ( see eq.[temp - el ] ) .",
    "putting , as before , @xmath160 and integrating approximately eq.[spectrn ] we find the spectral power of sbsl for a single breakdown is    @xmath161    where @xmath162and @xmath163 is , practically , the total number of electrons participating in the breakdown .",
    "note that the approximative eq.[sbsl ] is not sensitive to the form of decay of the field , it is important only that @xmath164 decays more steeply than @xmath165 , i.e. it is not important that for @xmath58 we use an expression for an incompressible liquid .",
    "the observed spectra are cut off in the shortwave region because of the absorption of water .",
    "this can be taken into account by multiplying eq.[sbsl ] by exp(-@xmath166 ) where @xmath167 is the size of the acoustic resonator ( @xmath168 cm @xcite ) .",
    "because of the urbach absorption tails @xcite the radiation maximum is located considerably below than @xmath169 .",
    "it should be emphasized that the spectrum given by eq.[sbsl ] resembles the black - body spectrum but temperature is given here by the effective temperature @xmath170 of hot electrons near the bubble surface .",
    "the value of @xmath171 may be much higher than the bubble gas temperature . experimentally observed spectra",
    "can be fitted , in the wavelength interval ( 200@xmath172 nm , to the black - body ones with temperatures ( 2@xmath05)10@xmath173k @xcite . according to eq.[temp - el ]",
    "such electron temperatures are reached at electric fields @xmath174 v / m for values of @xmath175ev and @xmath176 characteristic for water @xcite . as follows from eqs.[flex ] and",
    "@xmath177 such fields are realized at accelerations @xmath178 m / s@xmath179 similar accelerations are reported in @xcite .    integrating eq.[sbsl ] multiplied by exp(-@xmath166 ) we find an estimate of the radiation energy for a single breakdown    @xmath180    where @xmath181 is the characteristic photon energy which is close to the energy of the maximum of the observed spectrum , which is about ( @xmath182 in the case of strong electric field of our interest .",
    "recall that in eq.[power ] @xmath183 is the screening ( breakdown ) time and @xmath184 is the number of transmitted electrons in the screening process ( sec . 3 ) and",
    "@xmath185 is the concentration of noble gas atoms in a metastable state near the bubble surface .    as we have mentioned before it was shown in @xcite that because of dissolved gas diffusion and chemical reactions an accumulation of noble gas in the bubble takes place while the bubble pulsates and in stationary conditions the gas in the bubble consists almost entirely of noble gas .",
    "therefore one can assume that the concentration of the noble gas atoms , @xmath186near the bubble surface is close to its saturation value .",
    "note that this value has to be estimated for atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature rather than for the high pressures and temperatures existing at the last stage of the collapse over a very short time .",
    "this is why we assume that @xmath187 ( 10@xmath188 ) @xmath70 .",
    "now we will argue that the value of @xmath151 can be only one order of magnitude less than @xmath189 .",
    "indeed , for @xmath190 ev obtained above by fitting the sbsl spectrum to the black - body spectrum , the number of electrons having an energy higher than 10ev , @xmath191 may be about 1@xmath192 of the total electron number @xmath193 i.e. , @xmath191 is about 10@xmath194 .",
    "such a  superhot ",
    "electron excites a noble gas atom to the metastable state over the time @xmath195s for @xmath196@xmath197 @xmath198 m / s and @xmath187(10@xmath199 ) @xmath200 therefore a",
    " superhot ",
    "electron during its participation in screening excites @xmath201 noble gas atoms and the total number of the excited atoms is @xmath202 if one takes into account that @xmath203 @xmath204s .",
    "the total number of the noble gas atoms in the region of the strong field ( @xmath2051@xmath57m@xmath206 is about @xmath207 , i.e. the percentage of the noble gas atoms excited to the metastable state during a single breakdown can be about 10@xmath208 . since the life time of the metastable state is much more than @xmath4 and during this time interval several breakdowns can take place ( sec.3 ) , one may expect that the number of the noble gas atoms excited to the metastable state during the interval @xmath209 is only one order of magnitude less than the total number of these atoms i.e. @xmath151 @xmath205 10@xmath210 @xmath70 . if the life time of the metastable states exceeds the acoustic period ( @xmath211s ) an accumulation of noble gas atoms in the metastable states can also occur during several acoustic periods .",
    "now we can estimate the total radiation energy .",
    "we have mentioned above that the maximum value of @xmath193 , @xmath212 1@xmath57 m , @xmath213cm@xmath48 and @xmath215 .",
    "taking into account that the positive acceleration period @xmath2ns and the breakdown time @xmath216 is about 0.01ns one can assume that the number of breakdowns is not less than 10 .",
    "thus one finds from eq.[power ] that the maximum photon number in the sbsl pulse can be more than 10@xmath217 .",
    "this value corresponds to the maximum photon number observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "note that the radiation energy is a small part of the total energy of the flexoelectric field ( see ref@xcite ) .",
    "let us emphasize once more that within the mechanism of sbsl considered the main processes occur in water near the bubble surface unlike the most widely discussed mechanisms of sbsl @xcite . within the framework of this mechanism many experimental data about the sbsl can be explained quite naturally .",
    "of course , since the parameters of the collapsing bubble are not reliably known when the bubble radius is close to its minimum value we can present no more than order - of - magnitude estimations .",
    "the minimum duration of the sbsl flash is determined by the single breakdown ( screening ) time , @xmath218ps .",
    "a larger time is possible because of the multiplicity of breakdowns .",
    "the maximum duration is limited by @xmath2ns .",
    "the longer is the duration the greater is the energy of the flash .",
    "this is in agreement with experiments where it was found that the pulse duration changes from 30ps to 400ps when its energy increases @xcite .",
    "( iii ) . within our scenario",
    "the noble gas atoms play an important role .",
    "they do not reduce so much the breakdown threshold as they govern the radiation process .",
    "abundance of optical transitions in these atoms and inhomogeneous broadening because of the stark effect explain the practically continuous character of the sbsl spectrum .",
    "( iv ) . in agreement",
    "with the experiment @xcite the theoretical spectrum of the sbsl resembles the black - body spectrum but the temperature is given here by the effective temperature of the hot electrons which can be about several ev , what corresponds to the observed apparent radiation temperature @xcite . at the same time",
    "the gas temperature is not directly related to the radiation temperature and can be considerably less than 1ev .",
    "the increase of influence on sbsl intensity in the noble gas series he - xe observed in the experiment @xcite is connected with the decrease , in this series , of the energy of the lowest metastable state .",
    "note also that within our scenario of sbsl the influence of magnetic fields on sbsl is fairly weak .",
    "their influence becomes appreciable when they are high enough to hamper the heating of electrons@xcite .",
    "this might be the reason for the decrease of the sbsl intensity in strong magnetic fields which has been observed experimentally@xcite .",
    "\\(i ) the strong geometric asymmetry of the water molecule , which accompanies its electric asymmetry , provides the needed sign of the flexoelectric coefficient .",
    "this sign is such that the electric field has the  correct direction ",
    "( accelerates electron ) over the same ( very short ) period in which electrons are generated because of the sharp increase of the bubble gas temperature .",
    "the temporal coincidence of these two cicumstances is a possible reason of the effect of synchronization of the light pulses observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) high solubility of noble gases in water what makes possible high concentrations of noble gas in water near the bubble filled by the noble gas accumulated there in the process of the bubble pulsations .",
    "some experimentally found characteristics of sbsl have not been explained in this paper , in particular the dependence of the energy of the pulse upon the partial pressure of noble gases and water temperature @xcite .",
    "these dependences may be not necessarily a manifestation of the radiation processes studied in this paper but they could be a consequence of a set of various factors",
    ". they may be determined by the hydrodynamics of the pulsating bubble , the solubility of noble gases in water and also by the temperature dependence of the flexoelectric coefficient of water which still remains , unfortunately , unmeasured .",
    "although the main features of sbsl seem to be explainable within our scenario , these explanations are qualitative rather than quantitative .",
    "we are still a long way from a quantitative theory at present .",
    "one of the main aims of the paper is to stimulate some experiments that could either support or discard the proposed mechanis of sbsl .          after performing these experiments",
    "it makes sense to develop the theory further .",
    "in particular , it will be necessary to study in more detail the kinetics of the screening process and of the excitation of noble gas atoms while taking into account the time variation of the distribution function of the hot electrons .",
    "this problem should be considered together with that of the determination of the spatial distribution of excited noble gas atoms near the bubble surface .",
    "diffusion and relaxation of the excited atoms should be considered together , of course , with the processes that lead to noble gas accumulation in the bubble @xcite .    in our estimations we assumed that flexoelectric coefficient of water has its  natural  value .",
    "this was sufficient for the theoretical estimations to be in agreement with the experimental data .",
    "in fact , because of the above - mentioned strong geometric asymmetry of the water molecule , the coefficient could be even larger .",
    "if this is the case some new phenomena will take place including influence of the flexoelectric effect on hydrodynamics of the pulsating bubble and x - ray radiation induced by electrons of very high energy .",
