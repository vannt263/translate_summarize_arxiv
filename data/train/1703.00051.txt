    "<S> conclusions- _ we analyze , in terms of the graphene conductivity and of the structure reflection coefficients , both individual and collective effects of changing the temperature , the fermi level and the number of graphene sheets on the clp between graphene - dielectric multilayer structures . </S>",
    "<S> we exploit the fact that by changing @xmath7 , @xmath107 and @xmath65 it is possible to modulate the graphene ( semi)metallic features , and hence the reflectivity of the structure . for these structures we found that the clp can strongly depend on temperature , implying a dramatic change with respect to both single suspended graphene sheets ( more difficult to realize ) and dielectric slabs , and allowing the measurement of thermal effects at small separations . </S>",
    "<S> relevant similarities with normal 3d metals are found in some conditions . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that a consistent modulation of the clp can be obtained by varying the number of graphene sheets in the structure , or the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> this latter variation can be done by simply changing the electrostatic potential of the graphene sheets , and allows for a fast _ in - situ _ tuning of the interaction , which is of clear experimental interest . </S>",
    "<S> a natural direct extension of this study is to consider non - ordered graphene - dielectric multilayer structures in order to further sculpt the clp . </S>",
    "<S> these findings offer several opportunities for both experimental casimir investigations and for more applicative studies in micro / nano mechanical devices .    _ </S>",
    "<S> acknowledgments- _ we acknowledge florian bigourdan and george hanson for useful discussions . </S>"
