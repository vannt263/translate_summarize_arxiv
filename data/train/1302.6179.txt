    "the total optical losses are @xmath97 .",
    "these loss rates are necessarily accompanied by random fluctuating inputs @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 , for optical vacuum noise coming from the coupler , optical vacuum noise coming from other optical loss channels , and mechanical noise ( including thermal ) .",
    "the study of squeezing is a study of noise propagation in the system of interest and as such , a detailed understanding of the noise properties is required .",
    "the equations above are derived by making certain assumptions about the noise , and are generally true for the case of an optical cavity , where thermal noise is not present , and where we are interested only in a bandwidth of roughly @xmath101 smaller than the optical frequency ( 0  40  mhz bandwidth of a 200  thz resonator ) .",
    "for the mechanical system , where we operate at very large thermal bath occupancies ( @xmath102 ) and are interested in the broadband properties of noise sources ( 0  40  mhz for a 30  mhz resonator ) , a more detailed understanding of the bath is required , and will be presented in the section on thermal noise .    at this point , we linearize the equations assuming a strong coherent drive field @xmath103 , and displace the annihilation operator for the photons by making the transformation @xmath104 .",
    "this approximation , which neglects terms of order @xmath105 is valid for systems such as ours where @xmath106 , i.e.  the _ vacuum weak coupling _ regime .",

    "@xmath121 : bad cavity limit .",

    "we can easily calculate the properties of the detected spectrum @xmath130 , by writing @xmath131 in terms of @xmath132 and @xmath133 for which the correlators are known : ( ) & = & - ( ) - 2i ( ( ) + ( ) ) + & & + ( ( ) - ( ) ) .[eqn : approx_aout ] ignoring thermal noise for the moment ( @xmath134 ) , and dropping terms of order @xmath135 ( assuming @xmath136 ) we arrive at :    & = & 1 + 4(_/ _ ) ( 2).[eqn : approx_bare_sii ] note that for certain values of @xmath28 , the detected spectral density can be smaller than what one would expect for a vacuum field . for @xmath137",

    "this means that for squeezing to be present , coherent evolution of the mechanical system must be possible , i.e.  the rate at which phonons enter the mechanical system from the bath ( @xmath147 ) must be smaller than the mechanical frequency @xmath6 . in conclusion , the important requirements to achieve squeezing are to make @xmath32 comparable to @xmath6 , and to reduce the thermal occupancy or increase the mechanical quality factor to achieve @xmath148 .      as a next step ,",
    "we take into account the dynamics of the mechanical resonator while keeping the approximations of the bad - cavity limit ( @xmath149 ) and on - resonant probing ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "in addition to further clarifying some of the observed features , this treatement , as presented in the main text , elucidates the role of correlations between the mechanical system s position and the back - action force .",
    "the response of the mechanical system to a force is captured by its susceptibility : _ ( ) = .",
    "[ eqn : chi_m ] the form of the damping considered here is the strongly sub - ohmic structural damping which is observed in our measurements  @xcite ( cf .  section  [ ss : phenom_thermal_noise_model ] ) .",
    "the mechanical system responds to random noise forces @xmath150 from the thermal bath ( which we treated in the last section and neglect here ) , and to the quantum back - action from the cavity @xmath151 .",
    "the back - action force for the resonant case can simply be found by linearizing the expression for the radiation pressure force @xmath152 .",
    "we find the force imparted on the mechanics due to the shot - noise of the cavity field to be ( t ) = ( t)[eqn : fba ] for the case of resonant driving .",
    "the fluctuations imparted on the mechanics are from the intensity quadrature of the light ( @xmath153 ) .",
    "using equation  ( [ eqn : aoutsimple ] ) , we can write the output field quadrature as : ( t ) = -(t ) - 2 ( t ) ( ) .[eqn : xout_dynamic ] we note here that the mechanical position fluctuations are primarily imprinted on the phase quadrature of the output light , with @xmath154 .",
    "the intensity quadrature is unmodified ( @xmath155 ) since changes in the cavity frequency are not transduced as changes in intensity when the laser is resonant with the cavity .",
    "the output of the homodyne detector normalized to the shot - noise level is found by taking the auto - correlation of eqn .",
    "the correlations between radiation pressure shot - noise and the mechanical motion are important in this calculation  @xcite and must be taken into account . in the time - domain",

    "the key components of equation   are the shot - noise level , the thermal noise , and the cross - correlation between the back - action noise force and mechanical position fluctuations .",
    "it is only the latter which can give rise to squeezing , by reducing the fluctuation level below shot - noise .",

    "we see that for @xmath160 , squeezing is obtained in this limit . at frequencies larger than @xmath6 , @xmath161 changes sign , and we expect to see squeezing at quadrature angles @xmath162 .",
    "additionally , since @xmath161 becomes larger around the mechanical frequency , we expect the maximum squeezing to be enhanced .",
    "more specifically , at a detuning @xmath163 from the mechanical resonance , we expect the parameter characterizing the squeezing to be proportional to @xmath164 .",
    "all of these features are seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : squeeze_theory ] .",
    "it is important to note here that in the absence of other nonlinearities in the system , any reduction of the noise below the vacuum fluctuations can only be caused by the correlations between the rpsn and the position fluctuations of the system .",
    "this makes the problem of proving the correlations between rpsn and mechanical motion equivalent to the problem of proving that the reflected light from the optomechanical cavity has been squeezed .",
    "conceptually this form of probing the rpsn is similar to that carried out by safavi - naeini et al .",
    "@xcite and analyzed by khalili et al .",
    "it also shares features with the cross - correlation measurements proposed by heidmann et al .",
    "@xcite , and brkje et al .",
    "@xcite , and recent experiments by purdy et al .",
    "the distinguishing feature of this type of measurement is that the quantum correlations between the fluctuations of the position and the electromagnetic vacuum manifest themselves as squeezed light .      among the approximations made in section  [ ss : quasi - static ] , the quasi - static approximation is the least correct .",
    "in fact , in our experiments , the most observable squeezing occurs with @xmath144 close to @xmath6 and even slightly larger than @xmath6 , so @xmath122 is not valid . near the mechanical frequency ,",
    "resonant enhancement of the optical vacuum fluctuations by the mechanical resonator causes squeezing greater than that predicted in the quasi - static regime to be possible .",
    "here we show the results of a derivation that does not rely on most of the assumptions used in the approximate model . of the assumptions in the previous section ,",
    "the only simplification we keep here is to assume perfect coupling @xmath120 .",
    "the effect of imperfect coupling can be taken into account trivially and is explained after this section ( see  [ ss : imperfect_coupling ] ) .    by substitution of equation ( [ eqn : b_inputs ] ) into the equation for @xmath165 ( [ eqn : mech_fluct ] ) ,",
    "we arrive at : ( ) & = & a_1 ( ) ( ) + a_2 ( ) ( ) + & & + b_1 ( ) ( ) + b_2 ( ) ( ) , with    a_1 ( ) & = & + & & + a_2 ( ) & = & + & & + b_1 ( ) & = & + b_2 ( ) & = &    the expressions give us the output field in terms of the input fields , since ( ) & = & ( ) + ( ) ) + & = & ( 1+a_1 ( ) ) ( ) + a_2 ( ) ( ) + & & + b_1 ( ) ( ) + b_2 ( ) ( ) .",

    "therefore the effect of optical losses and coupling inefficiencies on the detected spectra can be calculated by replacing the measured field quadrature with : = + this source of vacuum noise is completely unrelated to the cavity output , and there are no cross - correlation terms , so the detected current spectral density will be given by |s^_ii ( ) = |s^_ii ( ) + ( 1-)|s^_ii ( ) , where @xmath171 is the shot - noise .",
    "measurement inefficiencies take two forms , one is due to ineffeciencies in the detection , while the second is because of excess electronic noise or `` dark current '' present due to the circuitry of the detector and amplifier .",
    "this excess noise can also be thought of as a detection inefficiency by considering the amount of optical shot - noise inserted into the signal which would produce it .",
    "since the dark - current is measured with no optical input , and the real shot - noise level increases linearly with the local oscillator ( lo ) power , this inefficiency is power dependent and can be minimized for large lo powers . in our case ,",
    "the dark current was found to be 10.4  db below the detected shot - noise .",
    "the total detector efficiency was measured to be @xmath172 .",
    "in order to estimate the total squeezing expected in our setup we carefully characterize all losses in our system .",
    "some of these losses are static ( e.g.  circulator losses ) while others can vary from experiment to experiment ( e.g.  coupling efficiency of the fiber taper to the waveguide ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : setup ] typical losses are shown as efficiencies ( @xmath169 ) for various parts of the experiment .",

    "in addition , the efficiency from port 3 of the circulator to the homodyne detector is @xmath175 .",
    "all these losses are fixed and do not change over time as the components are optically spliced together . measuring the coupling efficiency of the fiber taper to the waveguide",
    "is done every time a new data set is taken .",
    "this is accomplished by switching the light that is reflected from the waveguide to a power meter and comparing the reflected power to a known input power with the laser tuned off - resonance from the optical mode ( off - resonance the device acts as a near - perfect mirror ) .",
    "typical achieved efficiencies are around @xmath176 .",
    "the efficiency of the homodyne detection strongly depends on the alignment of the polarization between the local oscillator and the signal , as well as by how much the power in the lo overcomes the electronic noise floor of the detector . to determine this efficiency we use an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) inserted in our setup before the circulator in the signal path .",
    "the aom shifts the frequency of the light creating a tone 88  mhz away from the signal with a fixed , known amplitude , and identical polarization to the signal ( we directly measure the power of this tone with a power meter ) .",
    "this tone can now be used to determine the total homodyne efficiency by measuring its power on the spectrum analyzer , taking the other losses into account .",
    "our typical homodyne efficiency is @xmath172 resulting in a total setup efficiency ( detection efficiency of optical signal photons in the on - chip waveguide ) of roughly @xmath177 .     where @xmath28 is the phase difference between the lo and input to the cavity , and @xmath178 is the phase imparted by reflection off the cavity .",
    "this interference signal is used to actively stabilize the relative phase to different set points ( green traces ) .",
    "occasionally the lock fails , as shown by the red traces , and any associated data is discarded .",

    "careful calibration of our data is crucial in understanding all noise sources and potential drifts over time in our setup .",
    "the losses in our setup are determined before we make a new data run as described in the previous section .",
    "we then proceed to record an optical trace of the cavity resonance by switching the light to a photodetector ( pd1 in figure  [ fig : setup ] ) and scanning the laser wavelength .",
    "this trace provides the information to lock the laser to a fixed detuning ( typically @xmath180 red of the cavity resonance ) , which is accomplished using a simple software lock and feedback from the wavemeter ( with a resolution of roughly @xmath181 ) and is described in more detail in the subsection below . as a next step the optical signal is switched to the homodyne detector and the relative phase between the signal and the local oscillator is scanned using the fiber stretcher in the lo arm .",
    "the resulting interference is shown in figure  [ fig : phases ] as the blue trace .",
    "the interference signal is used to lock the relative phase between the signal and lo using a toptica digilock 110 .",
    "the green traces show the properly locked signal , while the red traces are phase set points where the lock failed requiring the associated data to be discarded .",
    "we then record the spectra of the homodyne signal and for every trace taken we also save a spectrum of the shot - noise by switching the signal arm away from the homodyne detector and only measure vacuum input to the signal arm of our detector .",
    "we re - lock the laser with respect to the cavity every other data point to counteract drift .",
    "this procedure is repeated for several different phases and different input powers .",
    "we typically took data for 60 different phases for every input power within a range of a little less than @xmath179 to @xmath30 .      .",
    "depending on the detuning , different mechanical mode amplitudes can be measured at this phase angle @xmath182 , according to the model .",
    "we obtain an accurate estimate of the detuning by calculating the detuning at which the mechanical mode amplitude is minimized at the measured @xmath182 as shown in * c*. the expected mode amplitudes for the detunings represented by the red and green lines in * c * are shown by the similarly colored curves in * b*. ]    the laser frequency is positioned at a detuning of roughly @xmath180 by starting at a larger detuning on the red side of the cavity , and stepping the laser blue in @xmath183  pm steps ( 12  mhz ) towards the cavity while monitoring the average intensity of the reflected light on pd1 .",
    "once the target intensity is reached , the laser is kept at this wavelength during the course of the measurement by the wavemeter lock without further feedback from pd1 .",
    "the intensity reading gives us an idea of the value of the detuning which is determined more accurately by analysis of our homodyne spectra .",

    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : phase_noise]a and c. the noise floor was seen to only increase linearly with laser power , confirming the absence of intensity noise at the frequencies of interest .",

    "following the derivation in section  [ ss : detailed_squeezing_derivation ] and taking the classical noise component of the field input to the cavity to be @xmath235 ( with a corresponding lo phase noise of @xmath236 ) , we arrive at an expression for the output noise due to input phase noise from the cavity : a_^ ( ) ( ) = i _ ( 1 + a_1 ( ) - a_2 ( ) ) ( ) . without optomechanical interaction ( @xmath237 ) we find @xmath238 , and @xmath239 .",
    "we calculate the expression for the current noise due to laser phase noise using this expression : i^ ( ) ( ) & = & _ ^a_^ ( ) ( ) + _ [ a_^()(-)]^ + & & + _ ^a_^ ( ) ( ) + _ [ a_^()(-)]^ + & = & f ( ) ( ) with @xmath240 $ ] .",

    "for an over - coupled cavity with no optomechanical coupling , @xmath243 , so @xmath244 , and we have @xmath245 .",
    "the @xmath144 dependence of @xmath246 means that a flat frequency fluctuation spectrum ( @xmath247 , as we observe ) adds a flat noise floor to the detected signal .",
    "finally we note that phase noise on the laser can drive the mechanical motion and cause heating .",
    "this effect is negligible since we are tuned near resonance , where only the intensity fluctuations affect the mechanics , and our cavity has a very large linewidth @xmath20 .",
    "mechanical damping of resonators and the associated fluctuations from coupling to the thermal bath has long been considered as an impediment to measuring weak forces in gravitational wave detectors  @xcite . in these studies",
    "the effect of the bath has often been encapsulated in a parameter @xmath248 , representing the lag angle in the response of the material to a force .",
    "this lag angle is the complex part of the spring constant : @xmath249 .",
    "the quality factor of the resonator is given by the narrow - band properties of the lag angle and its value at the mechanical resonance frequency , @xmath250 .",
    "we are interested in the wideband properties of @xmath248 , since the spectral properties of the thermal fluctuations are related to the spectrum @xmath248 , following the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .    in the case of our experiments , we observed noise floors for @xmath251 following a @xmath90 power law on the low frequency end .",
    "this sort of noise power law corresponds to a flat spectrum for the lag angle @xmath252 over the frequency range of interest .",
    "unlike viscous damping which can be simply shown to have @xmath253 ( since the force is proportional to velocity ) , a lag angle constant in frequency lacks a simple physical explanation , though it is ubiquitous in many types of mechanical resonators and commonly called `` structural damping ''  @xcite .    in the input - output formalism outlined in section  [ sec : theory_squeezing ] we model this type of noise by taking the mechanical damping rate @xmath96 to be spectrally flat , and using frequency dependent bath correlation functions @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath143 .",
    "this constitutes our single - mode thermal noise model .    in any real optomechanical system , a family of mechanical modes couples to the optical resonance .",
    "in the modal picture which we use here , each of these mechanical resonances can be thought to add to the detected noise floor with its contribution scaling at the low - frequency end as @xmath90 .",
    "the contribution of each mode is proportional to the bath temperature , @xmath254 , @xmath255 , and @xmath256 .",
    "we lump all of these contributions into a single effective mechanical resonance , with its properties ( not all independent ) determined by fitting to the low frequency end of the noise floor .",
    "this mechanical resonator is modeled with a mechanical frequency @xmath257 ( so we operate in the low frequency tail ) , a mechanical quality factor @xmath258 , and a total coupling rate of @xmath259 .",
    "we found that this model reproduced the magnitude and phase ( the quadrature in which the noise is detected ) of the @xmath90 noise well , if an additional intracavity photon - dependent heating of @xmath260k / photons is assumed .",
    "these background noise floors are plotted in figure  [ fig : noise_models ] .",
    "this cavity heating rate leads to the effective bath temperature to nearly double at the highest input powers , going from 16 k to over 30 k. this amount of heating is in line with what we expect from thin - film photonic crystals we have fabricated in the past operating in the same cryostat  @xcite .      .",
    "the deviation between the modeled and experimental data predominantly results from additional mechanical modes . ]        in addition to the noise in the quadrature of the mechanical motion ( which arises from fluctuations in the cavity frequency @xmath5 , and we suspect is mechanical in origin ) , we observed a significant amount of noise in the opposite quadrature , which can be interpreted to arise from fluctuations of the cavity decay rate @xmath20 .",
    "additionally , we observed a different noise floor power law ( @xmath89 ) for this noise , which may rule out an optomechanical origin .",
    "the power law scaling agreed with thermorefractive noise studied extensively in the context of gravitational wave detection  @xcite , microspheres  @xcite , and microtoroids  @xcite , but it is expected that thermorefractive coupling is predominantly in the same quadrature as the mechanical noise , which is not observed here .",
    "also , if thermorefractive , the noise should show strong variation with temperature through both a quadratic temperature scaling ( @xmath261 ) and an extremely steep variation of @xmath262 in the temperature range of 16  k to 30  k  @xcite , which was not observed . at this point",
    ", we have no noise model to explain the observed fluctuations , and the origin of this noise will be the subject of further investigation to be presented at a later time .",
    "a phenomenological noise model was instead used , where fluctuations in the cavity linewidth proportional to the intracavity power with a @xmath89 noise spectrum are assumed .",
    "our spectrum analyzer ( tektronix rsa3408b ) operates by taking fourier transforms of a time domain signal . by windowing a short time sample , and calculating its energy spectrum ,",
    "a power spectral density is constructed .",
    "the size of the window in the time - domain affects the resolution bandwidth , and is well known in signal processing , multiplication by a gaussian window of length @xmath263 is equivalent to convolution of the frequency domain signal by a gaussian with width proportional to @xmath264 .",
    "all of the measured data , except that presented in section  [ ss : thermometry ] was taken with a 40  mhz window and 300  khz resolution bandwidth .",
    "the spectra contain 501 points spaced by 80  khz in the frequency domain .",
    "additionally , for a few data sets we took narrow band spectra ( down to 100  hz resolution bandwidth ) and found that the results agreed over the regions where squeezing was observed .",
    "the theory was calculated at 100 times finer resolution than the sampled data ( with 50,000 points ) , and was then down - sampled after a gaussian convolution step simulating the operation of the spectrum analyzer .",
