    "although we are still far from a complete theory unifying quantum mechanics and general relativity , the noncommutative ( nc ) space - time is a common feature appearing in many existing theories of quantum gravity .",
    "the concept of noncommutative space - time was first introduced in snyder s pioneer work @xcite .",
    "interest in noncommutative space - time has been revived in the recent decades due to its connection to string theory @xcite ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "it is generally believed that the stringy effect can only be observed at the planck scale @xmath2 .",
    "however , given the scenario suggested by the extra - dimension theories @xcite that the large hierarchy between planck scale @xmath2 and the weak scale @xmath3 can be strongly reduced , one can expect to see the nc effect at tev scale , which is detectable in the lhc and other planned colliders .",
    "a popular noncommutative model is that the nc space - time is characterized by the coordinate operator satisfying @xmath4=i\\theta_{\\mu\\nu}=\\frac{ic_{\\mu\\nu}}{\\lambda^2_{nc } } , \\label{homer}\\ ] ] where the matrix matrix @xmath5 is constant , antisymmetric and real , in units of @xmath6 .",
    "the elements of the dimensionless constant matrix @xmath7 are assumed to be of order unity , and @xmath8 represents the nc scale .",
    "one can decompose the nc parameters @xmath5 into two classes : electric - like component @xmath9 associated with time - space noncommutativity and magnetic - like component @xmath10 associated with space - space noncommutativity . through the weyl correspondence ,",
    "the quantum field theory in nc space - time can be equivalent to that in commutative space - time with the ordinary product of field variables replaced by the weyl - moyal star product @xcite @xmath11 using this method , the qed in noncommutative space - time ( ncqed ) has been constructed and extensively studied by many authors ( for a review , see @xcite ) . however , to build a nc extension of the standard model ( ncsm ) , one encounters some obstructions , such as charge quantization @xcite and the no - go theorem @xcite .",
    "up to now , a minimal version of the noncommutative standard model ( ncsm ) has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the consistency problem mentioned above is overcome when one generalizes the su(3)*su(2)*su(1 ) lie algebra gauge theory to the enveloping algebra value using the seiberg - witten map ( swm ) method @xcite .",
    "the swm means that there is a map between the noncommutative fields and their classical counterparts as a power series expanded in @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the fields in nc space - time .",
    "the ncsm predicts not only nc correction of particle vertex but also new interactions beyond the standard model in ordinary space - time , e.g. @xmath16 and @xmath17 vertices @xcite .",
    "the rich phenomenological implications have led to intense studies of various high energy processes @xcite .    in the construction of ncsm , the so - called hybrid gauge transformation and hybrid swm of higgs fields are adopted to ensure covariant yukawa terms @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the higgs fields feel a `` left '' charge and a `` right '' charge in nc gauge theory .",
    "although only applied to the higgs sector in ref .",
    "@xcite , the method can in principle be extended to all other fields .",
    "one of the extensions has resulted in notable new physics predicted by ncqed : the tree - level interaction between neutrino and photon @xcite . in ncqed ,",
    "the interaction between fermion and photon are of three types : @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the first two interaction are charge conjugated of each other .",
    "one can also consider it as the ambiguity in the ordering of weyl - moyal product .",
    "the third coupling is particularly interesting . in this case , the neutral particle transforms under nc u(1 ) gauge field from the left and right sides in a similar way as in the adjoint representation in the ordinary non - abelian gauge theory .",
    "the covariant derivative is @xmath21_{*}.\\ ] ] then the action is invariant when @xmath22 encounters the hybrid gauge transformation @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "the phenomenology of photon - neutrino interaction has been extensively explored @xcite .",
    "it is well known that one can not construct interactions such as @xmath25 in the context of lie algebra because the covariant derivatives can only be applied to the fermion fields of charged 0 , @xmath26 @xcite . however , as mentioned above , this restriction can be broken by extending the group structure from lie algebra to the enveloping one with the help of swm , as discussed in sec .",
    "we shall see below that this will lead to interesting phenomenological implication .    on the other hand , the ncsm in ref .",
    "@xcite is constructed without including the neutrino mass . however , neutrino oscillation experiments have provided convincing evidence of massive neutrinos and lepton favor mixing @xcite .",
    "thus it is natural to question if the massive neutrinos and its direct interaction with photon as mentioned above can accommodate each other in the framework of ncsm .",
    "the issue has been studied in ref .",
    "it is found that such an extension does not work for massive dirac neutrino , while massive majorana neutrinos are still consistent with the gauge symmetry .",
    "this means we have to accept the photon - neutrino interaction at the cost of ruling out the popular seesaw mechanisms @xcite that successfully generates dirac neutrinos with small mass scale in the standard model and majorana neutrinos with the gut mass scale . in a recent work @xcite , the authors showed that the difficulty presented in ref .",
    "@xcite can be overcome by appropriately generalizing the nc gauge transformation and swm to a hybrid formation . in this sense",
    ", we can construct a generalized ncsm including the seesaw model and neutrino - photon interaction .",
    "the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite derived the feynman rules of photon - neutrino interaction and z boson - neutrino interaction in the ncsm incorporated with type i seesaw mechanism .",
    "as an phenomenological application , the @xmath27 boson decays were studied in a very recent work@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to investigate if generalization of the ncsm has any nontrivial effect on the phenomenology .",
    "a first choice is to explore the distinct neutrino - photon interaction which has been studied by many authors @xcite . in this paper , however , we focus our attention on a simple high energy process @xmath0 .",
    "the processes has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite using the nc corrected feynman rules up to @xmath28 order .",
    "it has been shown that after considering all orders of the seiberg - witten map , the nc correction to the @xmath29 appears only as phase factors , leaving no net noncommutative effect @xcite . in the generalized mncsm ,",
    "things are different . as we shall see later , the covariant derivatives of leptons require modifications to guarantee the gauge invariance of the dirac - type mass term due to the presence of photon - neutrino interaction .",
    "we shall see that the modifications will have impact on the lowest order gauge coupling of charged leptons and eventually lead to a nontrivial nc correction for the scattering cross section . in sec .",
    "2 , we first introduce the hybrid gauge transformation by considering the simplest case : the ncqed with @xmath30 abelian group . then , we briefly review the ncsm incorporated with massive neutrino and neutrino - photon interaction given in ref .",
    "the relevant feynman rules involving all orders of the nc parameter @xmath12 are derived . in sec .",
    "3 , we give the scattering amplitude of @xmath0 in the laboratory frame where the earth rotational effect is considered .",
    "numerical analyses of the total cross section and angular distribution are presented in sec.4 .",
    "we summarize our results in sec.5 .",

    "the action is invariant under the gauge transformation @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath24 .",
    "from the view point of gauge invariance , there is no @xmath36 requirement that we must take eq . as the only possible representation . in the enveloping algebra formulation ,",
    "the nc gauge theory works well for arbitrary charges . with the help of swm , one can extend eq .",
    "to the so - called hybrid formation in which the spinor @xmath31 proceeds under both `` left '' and `` right '' transformation : @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "then the corresponding covariant derivative is @xmath40 where we define the `` left ( right ) '' nc gauge fields @xmath41(@xmath42 ) transforming as @xmath43 @xmath44 one can think of @xmath31 as having a `` left '' charge @xmath45 and a `` right '' charge @xmath46 .",
    "however , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are gauge fields not for different particles but for the different nc representations of swm of the ordinary gauge potential @xmath47 . up to the zeroth order of @xmath12 , their expressions of swm are the same : @xmath48 . when the limit @xmath49 is taken , the nc covariant derivative eq .",
    "reduces to the ordinary one with the right electro - charge in commutative space - time .",
    "the hybrid feature presented here is derived from the degrees of freedom of nc gauge theory .",
    "the exact value of @xmath46 can not be constrained by the nc gauge invariance itself . in the existing literature , the @xmath46",
    "is set to zero and the electron field @xmath31 only transforms as simplest representation eq . .",
    "we believe that existence of more subtle representation is possible , and explore the phenomenological implication of it . the argument used in abelian case",
    "can easily be extended to more realistic models . in the subsection b",
    ", we use a generalized ncsm as proposed in ref .",

    "it is noted that in the generalized ncsm , we need not only the doublet higgs fields but also a singlet higgs fields to ensure the majorana mass term of the right handed neutrino .    in ordinary space - time , the neutral - hyper - charged @xmath59 singlet does not directly couple to any gauge field .",

    "@xcite , not only the higgs fields but also the charged lepton fields show hybrid feature , where the fields transform under the gauge potentials from both the left and right sides .",
    "thus , the covariant derivatives of the lepton fields are given by @xmath67 @xmath68 where the @xmath69 is the @xmath70 gauge potential and the @xmath71 is the coupling constant .",
    "now we consider the lepton sector of the generalized mncsm .",
    "using eqs . and",
    ", the corresponding action is @xmath72 . \\label{lepton}\\ ] ] the next step is to replace the nc fields in the action with their counterparts in ordinary space through appropriate seiberg - witten mapping .",
    "usually , the swm can be derived as perturbative solutions of the gauge equivalence relation order by order .",
    "recently , the so - called @xmath12 exact seiberg - witten maps involving all orders of the nc parameter @xmath12 have been obtained by directly solving the gauge equivalence relation @xcite or using the recursive formation of the seiberg - witten map @xcite . here , we just list the results given in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath73 with the extended products @xmath74 and@xmath75 defined by @xmath76 @xmath77 the notation @xmath78 means we only consider the swm to the first nontrivial order in the number of gauge potentials . theoretically , it is difficult to obtain the analytic expressions of the higher order terms .",
    "we note , however , that for the processes @xmath0 , the number of gauge fields taking part in each vertex is not more than one .",
    "thus , we can omit the higher order contribution . substituting eq . into eq . and imposing spontaneous symmetry breaking under the unitary gauge , we can derive all the needed vertices . the corresponding feynman rules are @xmath79 for the photon - electron - electron vertex , and @xmath80 for the z boson - electron - electron vertex . here",
    "@xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) is the momentum of the electron ingoing ( outgoing ) to the vertex ; @xmath83 ; @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 is the weinberg angle .",
    "since we are only concerned with the lowest tree - level process , the equations of motion are applied to the particles in the external lines and the terms vanish since the on - shell conditions are ignored .",
    "the vertex given above contains not only an exponent - type nc phase factor from the moyal product @xcite but also a periodic term .",

    "the figure shows that for a fixed collision energy the cross section has a parabolic dependence on @xmath65 . despite different nc scale parameters at around 1 tev , the total cross section is greatly enhanced when @xmath65 is at [ -0.5 , 0 ] and about [ 0.9 , 1.5 ] .",
    "if @xmath65 is at about [ 0 , 0.9 ] , the cross section will be suppressed .",
    "we note that a similar picture also appears in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the deformation of covariant derivatives is due to__a priori _ _ assumption and only limited to the higgs sector .",
    "thus , in that case no nc effect is manifested in the process @xmath0 . in sec .",
    "2 , we have shown that the feynman rules of electron - photon interaction and electron- z boson interaction contain sin - type deformation coming from the consistency between the neutrino - photon interaction and seesaw extension of sm .",

    "this unique feature can help us to identify the nc effect from the other effects .      since @xmath88 is assumed to be a stationary vector fixed in the primary frame , any physical value calculated in nc space - time is not only sensitive to @xmath8 but also to its direction parameter @xmath144 .",

    "different from @xmath133 , the minima of the nc corrections are round @xmath152 rad .",
    "in this work , we have considered a generalized noncommutative standard model , in which the massive neutrino and direct neutrino - photon interaction are included .",
    "it is found that the direct neutrino - photon interaction in nc space - time will have effect in the lepton sector and introduce hybrid gauge transformation by requiring gauge invariance . as an application ,",
    "we study the tev phenomenology of @xmath0 scattering at @xmath153 linear colliding . in ncsm without hybrid gauge transformation , it was found that when all orders of @xmath12 are included , there is no nc correction to the squared amplitude of @xmath0 process . in the generalized ncsm ,",
    "however , after deriving the corresponding feynman rules , we find that there are additional sin - type deformations compared to the ones given in ref .",
    "these deformations lead to the nontrivial phenomenological implication that the cross section of @xmath0 process can also have the nc effect , which is potentially detectable in the future international linear collider ( ilc ) .",
    "the earth s rotation is also included .",
    "the cross section and angular distribution are analyzed in the laboratory frame .",
    "pair production of muons via @xmath154 collision in the ilc should provide an ideal opportunity for probing not only the nc space - time , but also the mathematical structure of the corresponding gauge theory .    whether the deformed terms exist and how can one fix the value of @xmath65 is still an open question .",
    "this may be because we still have not enough information on the renormalizability of the nc quantum field theory , where freedom of the deformation terms can be used to cancel the uv divergence @xcite .",
    "it is expected that further work on the renormalizability can remove these ambiguity . before that one can treat it as an effective theory and the phenomenological study can give constraints on it , as has been done in the study of quarkonia decays @xcite .",
    "it is feasible to investigate other standard scatterings such as the moller and bhabha scattering .",
    "although these processes are more kinematically complicated , they are ideal cases for detecting noncommutativity between space and space . this topic is interesting and deserve further study .",

    "<S> the hybrid gauge transformation and its nontrivial phenomenological implications are investigated using the noncommutative gauge theory with the seiberg - witten map expanded scenario . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , the @xmath0 process is studied with a generalized noncommutative standard model ( ncsm ) including massive neutrinos and neutrino - photon interaction . in this model , the hybrid gauge transformation in the lepton sector is naturally introduced through the requirement of gauge invariance of the seesaw neutrino mass term . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that in the ncsm without hybrid gauge transformation the noncommutative correction to the scattering amplitude of the @xmath1 process appears only as a phase factor , predicting no new physical deviation in the cross section . however </S>",
    "<S> , when the hybrid feature is considered , the noncommutative effect appears in the single channel process . </S>",
    "<S> the cross section and angular distribution are analyzed in the laboratory frame including earth s rotation . </S>",
    "<S> it is proposed that pair production of muons in the upcoming tev international linear collider ( ilc ) can provide an ideal opportunity for exploring not only the nc space - time , but also the mathematical structure of the corresponding gauge theory . </S>"
