    "<S> we use the mermin dielectric function , which includes relaxation time explicitly . the relaxation time is evaluated by treating the average atom as an impurity in a uniform electron gas and depends critically on the transport cross section . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated relaxation rates agree well with values inferred from the ziman formula for the static conductivity and also with rates inferred from a fit to the frequency - dependent conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> transport cross sections determined by the phase - shift analysis in the average - atom potential are compared with those evaluated in the commonly used born approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the born approximation converges to the exact cross sections at high energies ; however , differences that occur at low energies lead to corresponding differences in relaxation rates . </S>",
    "<S> the relative importance of including relaxation time when modeling x - ray thomson scattering spectra is examined by comparing calculations of the free - electron dynamic structure function for thomson scattering using lindhard and mermin dielectric functions . </S>",
    "<S> applications are given to warm - dense be plasmas , with temperatures ranging from 2 to 32  ev and densities ranging from 2 to 64  g / cc . </S>"
