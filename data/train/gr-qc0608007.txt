    "the full scale terrestrial interferometric gravitational wave antennae ligo are working now and have sensitivity , expressed in terms of the metric perturbation amplitude , only @xmath4 or @xmath5 times worse than the planned level of @xmath6 @xcite ( see current sensitivity curve in @xcite ) . in advanced ligo",
    "( to be realized in approximately 2012 ) , after the improvement of the isolation from noises in test masses ( the mirrors of the 4 km long optical fp cavities ) and increasing the optical power circulating in the resonator up to @xmath7  kw the sensitivity is expected to reach the value of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we have analyzed the undesirable effect of parametric oscillatory instability in the fabry - perot ( fp ) cavity , which may cause a substantial decrease of the antennae sensitivity or even the antenna malfunction .",
    "this effect appears above the certain threshold of the optical power @xmath9 circulating in the main mode , when the difference @xmath10 between the frequency @xmath2 of the main optical mode and the frequency @xmath0 of the idle ( stokes ) mode is close to the frequency @xmath1 of the mirror mechanical degree of freedom .",
    "the coupling between these three modes arises due to the ponderomotive pressure of light in the main and stokes modes and the parametric action of mechanical oscillation on the optical modes . above the critical value of light power @xmath9 the amplitude of mechanical",
    "oscillation rises exponentially as well as optical power in the idle ( stokes ) optical mode .",
    "however , e. dambrosio and w. kells have shown @xcite that if in the same unidimensional model the anti - stokes mode ( with frequency @xmath11 ) is taken into account , then the effect of parametric instability will be substantially dumped or even excluded . in @xcite , we have presented the analysis based on the model of power recycled ligo interferometer and demonstrated that anti - stokes mode could not completely suppress the effect of parametric oscillatory instability . as possible `` cure '' to avoid the parametric instability we have proposed to change the mirror shape and introduce low noise damping @xcite .",
    "d. blair with collaborators proposed valuable idea to heat the test masses in order to vary curvature radii of mirrors in interferometer and hence to control detuning and decrease overlapping factor between optical and acoustic modes @xcite .",
    "recently , the parametric instability effect was observed in experiment @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that the effect of parametric instability is important not only for large scale ligo interferometer but it was observed also for micro scale whispering gallery optical resonators @xcite .    in this paper we propose the detail analysis of parametric instability in signal recycled advanced ligo interferometer ( i.e. with additional signal recycling ( sr ) mirror ) and show that , on the one hand , the parametric instability in this interferometer can appear at low optical power ( about several watts ) but , on the other hand , the probability that parametric instability condition will be fulfilled is small due to small relaxation rates of optical modes ( about several hz ) .",
    "we also show that by varying the position of sr mirror one can change the frequency of anti - symmetric optical mode of interferometer and hence to scan the range of frequencies where parametric instability or its precursors may arise .    in section [ srint ]",
    "we derive the parametric instability conditions in signal recycled ligo interferometer , we discuss these results in section [ discussion ] .",
    "the details of calculations we present in appendices .",
    "we consider the ligo interferometer with signal recycling ( sr ) and power recycling ( pr ) mirrors  see fig .",
    "[ srscheme ] and notations over there .",
    "the port @xmath12 is used for signal detection .",
    "interferometer is pumped via port @xmath13 .",
    "simplifications are the following :    * optical losses in all mirrors are absent ( notes about generalization for non zero losses are made in the end of sec .  [ discussion ] ) .",
    "suspension noise in mirrors is also absent .",
    "* transmittivity of input mirrors and length of both fp cavities are the same .",
    "they are tuned in resonance with the main mode . *",
    "optical power @xmath14 circulating inside the arms of interferometer is constant ( approximation of constant field ) . * the distances between the input fp mirrors and beam splitter , and between the beam splitter and pr , sr mirrors are short ( about several meters )",
    " hence we consider the phase advance of waves traveling between these mirrors as constant and omit its dependence on frequency .",
    "are the field amplitudes on the input mirror of the fp cavity 1 ( and on plane @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 are the field amplitudes on the input mirror of the fp cavity 2 and on the beam splitter , @xmath17 are the field amplitudes on the beam splitter . , scaledwidth=45.0% ]      we denote the mean amplitude of the wave in the main mode ( with frequency @xmath2 ) by cursive capital letters and small fluctuation amplitude of the wave in the stokes mode ( @xmath0 ) by small letters .",
    "for example , the electrical field of wave falling on back mirror in fp cavity 1 is the following : @xmath18 here @xmath14 is the mean power in the main mode circulating inside the cavity , @xmath19 is the speed of light , dimensionless functions @xmath20 describe the distributions of optical fields over the beam cross section , integration @xmath21 is taken over the mirror surface . for simplicity below we consider the distributions of optical fields to be identical at all four mirrors in the arms .",
    "we write down the displacement vector of the elastic mode with eigenfrequency @xmath1 , for example , for the end mirror of the fp cavity 1 as a product of time and space dependent functions : @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are slowly varying amplitudes and @xmath25 is spatial vector of displacements of elastic mode in the mirror .    here",
    "we assume that the input and the end mirrors in the fp cavity 1 are elastically identical ( the modes of their elastic oscillations coincide ) .",
    "then we start from the formulas derived in appendix [ aux ] in frequency domain : @xmath26 here @xmath27 is an overlapping factor ( [ n1 ] ) , @xmath28 is the distance between the mirrors of the fp cavities in arms .",
    "we also omit non - resonance terms ( @xmath29 ) . in order to clarify the dependence of @xmath30 we have to write down the last term in ( [ f1 in ] ) in detail and to equate exponential quantities in the left and right parts of ( [ f1 in ] ) : @xmath31    for the fp cavity 2 all formulas are the same . for the mean amplitudes we have : @xmath32 .",
    "we consider that @xmath33 are the field amplitudes on the pr mirror and the beam splitter , and @xmath34 are the field amplitudes on the beam splitter as it is shown in fig .",
    "[ srscheme ] .",
    "we assume that the beam splitter transparency is @xmath35 and the phase of the wave due to traveling between the fp cavity 2 and the beam splitter is @xmath36 , and between the fp cavity 1 and the beam splitter is @xmath37 .",
    "so we can imagine such plane ( see fig .  [ srscheme ] ) , that phase advance between the beam splitter and this plane is @xmath37 and between this plane and the input mirror of the fp cavity 1 is fold to @xmath38 .",
    "then @xmath39 are the field amplitudes on the input mirror of the fp cavity 1 ( and on the plane @xmath15 ) , @xmath16 are the field amplitudes on the input mirror of the fp cavity 2 and on the beam splitter . for the mean amplitudes",
    "we have : @xmath40 it is convenient to introduce symmetric and anti - symmetric modes @xmath41 : @xmath42 then for fluctuation fields @xmath43 and @xmath44 we have : @xmath45 we see that symmetric and anti - symmetric modes can be analyzed separately . in subsection [ sym ]",
    "we consider the symmetric mode which interacts with sum coordinate @xmath46 and in subsection [ asym ] : the anti - symmetric mode interacting with differential coordinate @xmath47 .",
    "it is worth to note that such consideration is possible only if all four mirrors in the fp cavities in arms are optically and elastically identical , just as we have assumed . for the opposite case ,",
    "when the eigenfrequencies of elastic modes are different we can consider elastic mode only in one mirror and assume other mirrors to be fixed ( see subsection [ diffmirrors ] ) .",
    "assuming that pr cavity is in resonance , we obtain two equations in time domain describing coupling between optical and elastic modes ( see details of calculations in appendix [ pr ] ) : @xmath48 here @xmath49 is the relaxation rate of symmetric mode ( [ gamma0 + ] ) , @xmath50 is the relaxation rate of elastic mode , @xmath51 is the mass of each of the mirrors , and @xmath52 is normalizing constant ( [ mu ] ) .",
    "we find the solutions of this set of equations ( [ fin+ ] , [ eqz+ ] ) in the form : @xmath53 and as a result we obtain the characteristic equation : @xmath54 here @xmath55 is general overlapping factor between the main , stokes optical modes , and elastic mode , @xmath56 is the component of displacement vector @xmath25 of elastic mode normal to the mirror surface , @xmath21 corresponds to the integration over the mirror surface and @xmath57 : to the integration over the mirror volume @xmath58 .",
    "we present @xmath59 as a sum of real and imaginary parts : @xmath60 , substitute it into ( [ chareq+ ] ) and obtain two equations : @xmath61 the parametric instability condition corresponds to @xmath62 .",
    "putting @xmath63 we find the condition of boundary situation ( between stability and instability ) .",
    "the additional analysis gives the sign of inequality in the parametric instability condition .",
    "we find formal solution for @xmath64 from ( [ cheq2 + ] ) with assumption @xmath63 , substitute it into ( [ cheq1 + ] ) , and obtain the parametric instability condition : @xmath65    this condition can be compared with the condition of parametric instability for single fp cavity @xcite with relaxation rate @xmath66 @xmath67 we see that conditions ( [ instcond+ ] ) and ( [ rq ] ) approximately coincide with each other if one substitutes @xmath49 instead of @xmath66 and takes into account inequality @xmath68 ( see estimates in appendix  [ param ] ) .",
    "the factor @xmath4 appears due to the fact that in derivation ( [ instcond+ ] ) we take into account the displacements of @xmath69 mirrors in the interferometer while in ( [ rq ] ) the displacement of only one mirror of fp cavity is taken into account .",
    "we assume that in general case the sr cavity is not in resonance and phase advance @xmath70 of the wave between the sr mirror and the beam splitter is an arbitrary one .",
    "we also assume that @xmath70 does not depend on frequency @xmath71 due to the short length of the sr cavity .",
    "after the calculations presented in appendix [ sr ] one can obtain two equations describing the coupling between optical and elastic modes : @xmath72 here @xmath73 is the relaxation rate of anti - symmetric mode ( [ gamma0- ] ) , @xmath74 is the detuning depending on the sr mirror position ( [ delta ] ) .",

    "so we can `` scan '' the frequency range to find instability ( or its precursors ) by variation of the sr mirror position .",

    "it provides us _ in situ _ with very valuable information about the possible danger of parametric instability .      here",
    "we consider the case when the frequencies of elastic modes in different mirrors do not coincide with each other and thus , we assume that the frequency of elastic mode of only one mirror is in resonance , for example , the end mirror in the fp cavity 1 .",

    ".    first of all we see that the main difference between the parametric instability in a signal recycled advanced ligo interferometer and in pure power recycled interferometer is the crucial dependence on detuning , compare eqs .",

    "recycled interferometer the parametric instability takes place if @xmath108 while in signal recycled interferometer : @xmath109 .    on the one hand , in case of relatively small detuning the parametric instability in a signal recycled interferometer takes place at relatively low value of optical power .",
    "for example , if @xmath110 and @xmath111 one can obtain from eq .",
    "( [ srpicond ] ) that the parametric instability will take place at power @xmath112  w ( ! ) circulating in arms ( if @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 ) . on the other hand , there is a small chance that such small detuning will take place and for large detuning ( @xmath116 ) the realization of parametric instability requires dramatically larger optical power : @xmath117 .",
    "for example , if detuning is about 1  khz ( @xmath118 sec@xmath119 ) and other parameters are the same one can obtain @xmath120  w ( ! ) .",
    "for the same reason the possibility that the presence of anti - stokes mode can depress the parametric instability is small enough especially for such detunings .",
    "therefore , we did not consider the anti - stokes mode in our analysis ( `` anti - stokes '' generalization can be done using the same approach as in @xcite ) .",
    "another factor that can decrease the possibility of parametric instability is the small value of overlapping factor ; even if the frequencies of stokes and elastic modes `` suit '' each other their spatial distributions ( at mirrors surface ) may considerably decrease the overlapping factor @xmath55 and , hence , the possibility of parametric instability .",
    "the elastic modes can be calculated numerically .",
    "unfortunately , the numerical calculations of elastic modes of cylinder mirrors face with obvious difficulty : the accuracy of elastic mode frequencies calculations is dramaticaly insufficient .",
    "the standard packages femlab or ansys , used for this purpose @xcite , provide the accuracy about _ several percents _ only , while we need the accuracy at least @xmath121 ( ! ) .",
    "nevertheless , numerical calculations have sense for estimates of overlapping factors and as information ( about the frequency range ) for the experimentalist where the parametric instability may occur .",
    "even if the numerical calculation methods will be improved to the extent that they will achieve the required accuracy , they can not solve the problem completely because : ( i ) the shape of mirrors differs from the cylinder shape , for example , the pins to attach suspension fiber may produce the shift of elastic mode frequency up to @xmath122  sec@xmath119 @xcite and ( ii ) the inhomogeneity of fused silica ( the material mirrors should be manufactured of ) may also provide an uncontrollable shift of elastic mode frequency @xcite .",
    "that is why we present the separate consideration of the case when the elastic mode of only one mirror is taken into account in subsection  [ diffmirrors ] .",
    "parametric instability can also be investigated in geo600 configuration interferometer which also has signal and power recycling mirrors , but has no fp cavities in arms .",
    "hence the formulas above can be generalized for geo600 configuration by putting the transmittance of input mirrors in arms to be equal to @xmath123 and , hence , @xmath124 .",
    "then the relaxation rate of symmetric mode will be about @xmath125  sec@xmath119 ( we assume @xmath126  km ) and using formula ( [ instcond+ ] ) we estimate that parametric instability may take place at relatively small optical power @xmath127  w circulating in arms if we assume zero detuning @xmath128 , @xmath129  kg , @xmath130  sec@xmath119 , @xmath131  sec@xmath119 and @xmath132 .",
    "our consideration can be generalized for the case of mirrors with losses .",
    "let each mirrors in the fp cavity to have loss coefficient @xmath133 which is small compared to transparency : @xmath134 . in this case all formulas ( [ instcond+ ] , [ instcond- ] , [ pcondgamma ] , [ srpicond ] ) for parametric instability conditions are valid with the following substitutions : @xmath135 for advanced ligo the losses in mirrors are small enough ( it is planned that @xmath136  ppm , @xmath137 ) .",
    "however , the diffractional losses may be large for optical modes with high indices @xcite .",
    "kip thorne @xcite pointed out that the case of large diffractional losses ( when round trip relative losses are close to unity ) requires a separate analysis .",
    "this work is in progress now @xcite .",
    "we have shown that in the signal recycled advanced ligo interferometer the possibility of falling into the trap of the parametric instability is smaller than for the pure power recycled one due to stronger sensitivity to detuning .",
    "we think that the most reliable method to avoid the parametric instability is the _ direct experimental _ test . for signal recycled interferometer",
    "we have good method to investigate the possibility of parametric instability experimentally _ in situ _ : varying the sr mirror position , one can detune the frequency of anti - symmetric mode in wide range to find the instability or its precursors as it was shown in subsection  [ asym ] .",
    "it is important that for geo600 configuration we can introduce detuning larger than in advanced ligo : the scanning may be performed inside the free spectral range @xmath138 .",
    "this scanning combined with the detailed knowledge about the elastic modes ( it can be obtained _ in situ _ in separate experiments before the test masses are placed into the interferometer ) will provide us with very valuable information helpful for avoiding the parametric instability .",
    "we hope that parametric instability effect can be eliminated in advance ligo interferometer after the detailed experimental investigations supported by theoretical analysis .",
