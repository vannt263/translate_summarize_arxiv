    "entanglement is useful , but hard to generate , and even harder to detect .",
    "the most measurement - intense approach to the problem of experimentally detecting the presence of entanglement is to perform complete quantum - state tomography @xcite . even for just two qubits",
    "this implies a reconstruction of all 15 independent elements of the corresponding density matrix . subsequently applying the positive partial transpose ( ppt ) criterion to the reconstructed matrix gives a conclusive answer about entanglement or separability of the state  @xcite .    from the practical point of view",
    "it is desirable to have an entanglement detection tool that is more economical than full state tomography but nevertheless is decisive .",
    "already in the original work on ppt  @xcite it was noticed that one can always construct an observable @xmath0 with non - negative expectation values for all separable states @xmath1 and a negative expectation value for at least one entangled state @xmath2 . in this way an experimentally detected violation of the inequality @xmath3 is a sufficient condition for entanglement .",
    "the observable @xmath0 is called an entanglement witness ( ew )",
    ". there always exists an optimal choice of _ local _ orthogonal observables such that a given ew can be expressed as a sum of their direct products  @xcite , so that a witness can always be measured locally .",
    "the advantage of using ews for entanglement detection will be appreciated better for multi - partite systems with more than two qubits , because the number of tomographic measurements would grow exponentially with the number of qubits . on the other hand",
    ", a given witness does not detect all entangled states and therefore a variety of different ews should be tested in order to rule out false negative results .",
    "ews assume the validity of quantum mechanics , and also assume one knows what measurements one is actually performing .",
    "a valuable alternative to ew can be sought in using a violation of bell - chsh inequalities @xcite as a sufficient condition for entanglement ( although a bell - inequality test can be formulated as a witness , too @xcite ) . because bell inequalities are derived from classical probability theory without any reference to quantum mechanics , no assumption about",
    "what is being measured is necessary .",
    "this method is , therefore , safe in the sense of avoiding many pitfalls arising from unwarranted ( hidden ) assumptions about one s experiment @xcite .",
    "here we propose a different method for characterizing an entanglement source that automatically takes into account finite data as well as imperfect measurements .",
    "our method consist of two parts .",
    "the first part , `` bayesian updating , '' produces an estimate of the relative probabilities that entangled and separable states are consistent with a given finite set of data .",
    "this estimate depends on what _ a priori _ probability distribution ( the _ prior _ ) one chooses over all possible states ( the more data one has , the less it depends on the prior ) .",
    "that is , there is an _ a priori _ probability of entanglement , and each single measurement updates this probability to an _ a posteriori _ probability of entanglement .",
    "the latter then has to be compared to the former , in order to reach the conclusion that one is now either more certain or less certain about having produced an entangled state .",
    "in fact , every experiment can only make such probabilistic statements about entanglement , although this is almost never explicitly stated in these terms .",
    "thus our method differs from those in refs  @xcite which assume expectation values of ews are known [ corresponding effectively to an _",
    "infinite _ data set ] and try to find the _ minimally_-entangled state consistent with those expectation values .",
    "we use a numerical bayesian updating method for a probability distribution over density matrices , which is similar to that recently discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of quantum - state tomography .",
    "in particular , whereas the reconstruction of a density matrix from experimental data is usually based on the maximum likelihood estimation ( mle ) , ref.@xcite discusses its drawbacks and proposes bayesian updating in its stead as a superior method .",
    "our aim , though , is not to give an estimate of the density matrix , but of entanglement .",
    "in fact , any quantity that can be calculated from a density matrix , such as the purity of one s state , can be estimated this way .",
    "the second part of our method introduces two information criteria @xcite to judge how different models of a given entanglement generation process can be compared to each other quantitatively .",
    "it is probably best to explain this part by giving an example .",
    "for simplicity , we consider the case of two - qubit states .",
    "suppose an experimentalist has a model for her entanglement generating source that contains , say , two parameters describing two physically different sources of noise in the final two - qubit state produced .",
    "she may try to fit her data to her two - parameter model , but obviously there are always states in the full 15-dimensional set of all physical states that will fit the data better .",
    "there are a number of criteria , standard in the literature on statistical models , that compare quantitatively how different models fit the data . here",
    "we will use akaike s information criterion ( aic ) and the bayesian information criterion ( bic ) @xcite .",
    "these information criteria aim to find the most informative model , not the best - fitting model .",
    "the idea is that a two - parameter model fitting the data almost as well as the full quantum - mechanical description would provide more physical insight and a more economical ( think occam s razor ) and transparent description .",
    "each of the two information criteria , aic and bic , produces a number @xmath4 .",
    "one term in @xmath4 is the logarithm of the maximum likelihood possible within each model , and the second term subtracts a penalty for each parameter used in the model . the model with the larger value of @xmath4",
    "is then deemed to be the more informative .",
    "we propose here to combine information criteria with the bayesian updating methods for entanglement estimation .",
    "namely , we propose to use the more informative model to generate a `` substitute prior . '' in the case that the simpler model is the more informative , the numerical efforts required for our bayesian updating method are much smaller , and yet should lead to correct descriptions of the entanglement generated by one s source .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ bayesup ]",
    "we give a general formulation of our method of bayesian updating applicable to any quantum system .",
    "we also formulate precisely the two information criteria for model selection . in section [ exmpl ]",
    "we discuss numerical examples , which illustrate the bayesian methods and the information criteria . for concreteness",
    "we consider measurements of bell - chsh correlations ( although any sort of measurements would do ) .",
    "the examples show that our method detects entangled two - qubit states that escape detection by any of the bell - chsh inequalities and even by violations of the stronger version of these bounds , which we call roy - uffink - seevinck bounds @xcite . in the discussion and conclusions section",
    "we discuss the essential difference between our method of characterizing an entanglement source and the standard methods of entanglement verification @xcite .",
    "here we present a numerical bayesian updating method for one s probability distribution over density matrices .",
    "a related bayesian method was recently advocated in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of quantum - state tomography and quantum - state estimation .",
    "we note our aim is not to give an estimate of the density matrix , but , more modestly , to give estimates of entanglement , purity , and in principle any quantity that can be efficiently calculated from the density matrix .",
    "we first discuss the method in general , and subsequently we propose a new method to choose a prior probability distribution over density matrices .      the method itself can be formulated as a five - step procedure :    1 .   for a system of @xmath5",
    "qubits we first choose a finite test set of density matrices .",
    "we calculate the amount of entanglement ( in fact , the negativity ) for each state in the set .",
    "the _ a priori _ probability that our unknown experimentally generated state , which we denote by @xmath6 , equals a state @xmath7 in the set is chosen as @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the number of states in the set .",
    "we assume some set of povms with elements @xmath10 is measured .",
    "these povms can describe any ( noisy ) set of measurements one performs on the qubits .",
    "3 .   for the acquired measurement record @xmath11 consisting of the number of times",
    "outcome @xmath12 was obtained , qubits .",
    "] we calculate the quantum - mechanical probability @xmath13 that a given state @xmath7 from the test set generates the measurements outcome @xmath14 ( which follows directly from tr@xmath15 ) .",
    "having at hand probabilities @xmath13 for all states @xmath7 in the test set we are now able to calculate the _ a priori _",
    "probability @xmath16 for the measurement record @xmath14 to occur .",
    "4 .   we calculate  using bayes rule  the probability @xmath17 of having the state @xmath7 given the measurement outcomes @xmath14 : @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "we obtain the posterior probability distribution over density matrices in our test set : @xmath19 for all states @xmath7 .",
    "we can then repeat steps 2 - 5 for a new set of measurements @xmath14 , if needed .",
    "this procedure gives us , in step 5 , a numerical estimate of the _ a posteriori _ probability that the unknown state @xmath6 equals the state @xmath7 from the test set . from p@xmath20 we can estimate the probability @xmath21 for the state @xmath6 to be entangled .",
    "we just sum the probabilities @xmath22 for all entangled states @xmath23 in the set",
    "i.e. @xmath24 furthermore , we can calculate probability distributions for any function of the density matrix , such as the negativity and purity .",
    "we thus infer expectation values such as @xmath25 and @xmath26 as well as standard deviations @xmath27 etc .",
    "the meaning of our final probability distribution p@xmath20 and of the above expectation values is as follows . if we were forced to give a _",
    "single _ density matrix that best describes all data and that includes error bars , we would give the mixed state @xmath28 , as explained in @xcite .",
    "the purity and negativity of the state @xmath29 are _ not _ equal to ( in fact , smaller than ) the estimates @xmath30 and @xmath31 that we use here .",
    "the difference is this : if one were to perform more measurements that are tomographically complete , @xmath30 is the expected negativity of the final estimated density matrix .",
    "@xmath32 , on the other hand , would be the useful entanglement of a single copy available _ without _ performing more measurements .",
    "for most quantum information processing purposes ( such as teleportation ) one indeed needs more precise knowledge about the density matrix than just its entanglement .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for more discussions on this issue .",
    "the only problem standing in the way of a straightforward application of the above bayesian updating procedure is that a sufficiently dense test set ( used in step 1 ) is in general too hard to handle numerically , since even for two - qubit density matrices the parameter space is 15-dimensional .",
    "although there are certainly ways out of this problem ( in particular , sampling directly from the posterior probability distribution can be efficiently done with the metropolis - hastings algorithm , see e.g. @xcite ) , here we stick to the idea of a set of test states by simplifying that set , as follows .    as an illustrative example ( which we will again consider in great detail in the next section ) , consider an experimentalist trying to produce a maximally entangled bell state of 2 qubits , say , @xmath33 .",
    "she wants to test her entanglement - generating device by measuring some set of bell correlations .",
    "in particular , suppose she measures @xmath34 independent observables .    from her previous experience with the same device",
    ", she models the generation process by assuming there is both gaussian phase noise and white noise ( mixing with the maximally mixed state @xmath35 ) .",
    "that is , she assumes her device generates states of the form @xmath36 with @xmath37 $ ] and @xmath38 here @xmath39 is a gaussian phase distribution of the form @xmath40 with the normalization factor @xmath41 given by @xmath42 so there are just two parameters the experimentalist has to determine from her measurement results , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .    as a measure to judge how well her data @xmath14 fit the model ( [ ps1])([ps3 ] )",
    ", she considers the best likelihood for that model , @xmath45 she would like to compare this to the maximum likelihood over _ all _ physical two - qubit states @xmath7 , @xmath46 there are several ways to compare these two quantities @xcite .",
    "one criterion is called akaike s information criterion , and it defines the quantity @xmath47 for each model , where @xmath48 is the number of parameters in the model , and @xmath49 is the maximum likelihood for the model .",
    "the quantity @xmath4 rewards a high value of the best likelihood ( indicating a good fit ) , but penalizes a large number of parameters ( to guard against overfitting ) .",
    "now when measuring @xmath34 observables , the best complete model contains just @xmath50 , not 15 , independent parameters .",
    "thus the experimentalist would calculate two numbers @xmath51 if @xmath52 then the akaike information criterion judges the simple 2-parameter model to be more informative than the complete @xmath50-parameter model .",
    "there is a bayesian version of this criterion @xcite , and it is defined in terms of similar quantities @xmath53 where @xmath49 and @xmath48 have the same meaning as before , and @xmath54 is the number of data taken .",
    "again , if @xmath55 , the 2-parameter model is considered more informative than the @xmath50-parameter description . for @xmath56",
    "the bic puts a larger penalty on the number of parameters than does the aic .    in the case that the simple model turns out to be more informative , according to at least one of the two criteria [ this depends on the data ] , we propose that the experimentalist may well use the simple model to construct a test set of states .",
    "for example , she could assume as prior probability distributions for @xmath43 and @xmath44 that @xmath43 is uniformly distributed on the interval @xmath57 $ ] , and that @xmath44 is uniform on , say , the interval @xmath58 $ ] ( this is somewhat arbitrary , of course , as every prior is ) .",
    "then , the test set of states could be sampled by simply choosing @xmath59 uniformly spaced points in the interval @xmath57 $ ] for @xmath43 and @xmath41 uniformly spaced points in the interval @xmath58 $ ] for @xmath44 , thus creating a test set of @xmath60 states .",
    "the above model leads to states that are diagonal in the bell basis , @xmath61 examples --------      in the following we consider , as an example , two - qubit states with spin measurements performed on each qubit ( considered as a spin-1/2 system ) in _ two _ arbitrary spatial directions that are orthogonal , and we denote the corresponding spin operators by @xmath62 and @xmath63 for the first qubit , and @xmath64 and @xmath65 for the second qubit .",
    "this consitutes a measurement of 8 independent quantities , four single - qubit expectation values and four correlations .",
    "we note that in this case we can construct four bell - chsh operators from the four measured correlations : @xmath66 we then test two - qubit states that may be entangled but that do _ not _ violate any of the four bell inequalities that can be constructed from these four operators .",
    "in fact , we will not even optimize the choice of spatial directions , given an initial guess of what state should be produced , for violating a bell inequality .",
    "finally , we will add one more correlation to be measured , namely that involving the third dimension : @xmath67 .",
    "that is , whenever @xmath68 is measured on the first qubit , @xmath69 is measured on the second qubit .",
    "this addition makes the measurements on each qubit separately tomographically complete , but it does not lead to additional bell - chsh operators .",
    "the total number of independent observables measured in this case is 11 ( four are missing ) .",
    "thus , the parameter @xmath50 to be used for evaluating @xmath70 of eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) is @xmath71 .      determining the aic and bic criteria",
    "can be done analytically in most cases that we will consider here .",
    "first of all , we can bound the maximum likelihood over all states , given the sort of measurements from the preceding subsection .",
    "there are 20 observed frequencies , as follows : for each of the five correlation measurement @xmath72 , where @xmath73 take on the values @xmath74 there are four different outcomes , which we can denote by @xmath75 .",
    "if we denote these frequencies by @xmath76 , for @xmath77 , then the ( log of the ) maximum likelihood is bounded by @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the number of times the @xmath80 correlation was measured .",
    "if we assume all five correlations are measured equally often , then we have @xmath81 the bound is achieved when there is a physical state predicting the frequencies exactly as they were observed .",
    "let us choose directions of our spin measurements as @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "then , there are two obvious models an experimentalist could choose from : the first is the bell - diagonal model , containing three parameters , in which states are of the form @xmath85 the observed frequencies @xmath76 for the five correlations can not be all predicted to arbitrary accuracy by bell - diagonal states .",
    "in fact , most frequencies predicted by this model are independent of the values of @xmath86 , and are equal to 1/4 .",
    "the only predicted frequencies ( which we denote by @xmath87 so as to distinguish them from the observed frequencies @xmath88 ) that actually depend on the values of @xmath86 are @xmath89 the best - fitting bell - diagonal state can only predict the correct correlations between @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 measurements .",
    "for example , there is a bell - diagonal state predicting the correct value for the sum @xmath93 , but its prediction for the difference will always be zero .",
    "thus , the bell - diagonal state fitting the data best will have the following values for @xmath86 : @xmath94/2,\\nonumber\\\\ p_2&=&[-f_{111}-f_{114}+f_{221}+f_{224}+f_{331}+f_{332}]/2,\\nonumber\\\\ p_3&=&[f_{111}+f_{114}+f_{221}+f_{224}-f_{331}-f_{332}]/2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] provided the observed frequencies are such that the @xmath86 including @xmath95 are all nonnegative . in that case ,",

    "the two - parameter model is similar in its predictions the the bell - diagonal model .",
    "the only difference is that the parameters @xmath97 and @xmath98 are equal .",
    "thus this model can predict only two correlations correctly , namely @xmath92 and @xmath99 . the maximum likelihood for this model , then , is given by @xmath100/2)\\nonumber\\\\ & & + ( f_{332}+f_{333})\\log([f_{332}+f_{333}]/2)\\nonumber\\\\ & & + ( f_{111}+f_{114}+f_{222}+f_{223})\\times\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\log(1/4+(f_{111}+f_{114}-f_{221}-f_{224})/2)\\nonumber\\\\ & & + ( f_{221}+f_{224}+f_{112}+f_{113})\\times\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\log(1/4+(f_{221}+f_{224}-f_{111}-f_{114})/2)\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\sum_{k , i\\neq j}f_{ijk}\\log(1/4)],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] provided all inferred frequencies are nonnegative .",
    "the three parameters to be used for selecting the most informative model are then , in the case of aic : @xmath101 and similar expressions for the bic .",

    "in particular , the difference is that one s prior belief of the entanglement - generating source is certainly to be included in a bayesian description , but in entanglement verification methods such beliefs are not allowed .",
    "nevertheless , bayesian methods can be used for the stricter purpose of entanglement verification , as discussed in @xcite .    in order to characterize one s entanglement source ,",
    "then , it is allowed to use a model describing one s source , based on , e.g. , previous experiments and experiences with the same ( or similar ) device .",
    "we provided a criterion to judge whether a given model of one s source is more or less informative than other possible models .",
    "in particular , one can always parametrize the output states by using the full quantum - mechanical description of an arbitrary state of correct hilbert - space dimension .",
    "the latter model , though , while being complete , may have more parameters than wished for or needed .",
    "instead , one may be able to use a description of one s source in terms of a ( small ) number of physically relevant parameters .",
    "we proposed to use two criteria to judge the relative merits of such models , the akaike information criterion ( aic ) , and the bayesian information criterion ( bic ) @xcite .",
    "we then showed how the aic and bic can be used to choose a test set of states i.e. , an _ a priori _ probability distribution over quantum states generated by one s source : a bayesian method , of course , only produces probabilities of entanglement by first choosing a prior .",
    "if a simple model described one s source very well , then one s test set can be based on that model .",
    "we applied the aic and bic criteria to several examples , all involving two qubits , and showed that indeed , such criteria indicate whether model s predictions about purity and entanglement of the output of the source ( including a probability that one s output state is entangled , as well as an estimate of the amount of entanglement ) can be expected to be reliable or not .",
    "we demonstrated this by showing that certain estimates produced from a simple model are wrong if the information criteria deem the model to be less informative than the full 15d description of two - qubit quantum states , whereas those estimates are right on the mark , when the criteria deem the simple model to be more informative .",
