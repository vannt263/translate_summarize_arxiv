    "the presence of a large concentration of carbon , detected via c@xmath3 molecular bands , in the otherwise helium - rich atmosphere of many old ( @xmath4 years ) white dwarfs has been viewed for many years ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    ", spectroscopic searches for oxygen ( ultraviolet co bands ) or nitrogen ( violet cn bands ) have yielded abundance limits o / c@xmath10 increasing with temperature @xcite or o / c , n / c@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "although oxygen is a primary product of the triple - alpha ( 3-@xmath12 ) nuclear burning process , the actual amount of oxygen dredged - up along with carbon from the interior depends on its abundance profile in the core @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", nitrogen should be fully exhausted along with helium by the 3-@xmath12 process and is not expected in the atmosphere of white dwarfs with a fully - evolved core .",
    "recently , @xcite reported the discovery of two oxygen - rich white dwarfs alongside the carbon - rich dq sequence .",
    "the measured o / c abundance ratios ( @xmath13 ) imply core compositions dominated by oxygen ( 80 to 99% by mass ) .",
    "the stars were suspected by @xcite to be the descendents of the most massive stars to avoid core collapse ( 9 - 10@xmath9 ; * ? ? ? * ) .    clearly ,",
    "the surface composition reflects the white dwarf core composition which , in turn , is determined by the evolutionary path followed by the progenitor . in this context , we present in section 2 spectroscopic observations of the peculiar object nltt  16249 that show a strong balmer line series along with c@xmath3 swan and cn violet band absorptions .",
    "the observed radial velocity variations and a successful spectral decomposition and model atmosphere analysis ( sections 3.1 - 3.3 ) show that the object is in fact a close double degenerate system comprising a normal da white dwarf and a peculiar dq of similar optical luminosities .",
    "we examine possible evolutionary scenarios in section 3.4 , and we propose that the photospheric carbon to nitrogen abundance ratio ( c / n@xmath14 ) indicates that the core material was left partially unprocessed or that burning ceased before destroying all nitrogen in the envelope . finally , we summarize in section 4 .",
    "we first observed nltt  16249 on ut 2010 mar 26 with the r - c spectrograph attached to the 4 m telescope at kitt peak national observatory .",
    "we obtained three consecutive exposures of 900  s each using the kpc-10a grating with the wg360 order blocking filter .",
    "the spectra cover a wavelength range from 3660 to 6790   with a dispersion of 2.8   per pixel .",

    "next , we obtained a single echelle spectrum on ut 2010 nov 7 ( 2400  s exposure ) with the x - shooter spectrograph @xcite attached to the ut2 ( kueyen ) at paranal observatory .",
    "the spectrum covers a wavelength range from 3000   to 2.5 @xmath19 m on three separate arms with a resolving power @xmath20 for the uvb arm , 8800 for the vis , and 6200 for the nir .",
    "this intermediate dispersion spectrum confirmed our earlier findings and also revealed the presence of additional sequences from the @xmath21 cn system .",
    "the star could be identified as a dqaz , i.e. , a helium - rich white dwarf with traces of carbon and hydrogen along with additional elements such as nitrogen , although the strength of the hydrogen lines is incompatible with this interpretation . more likely , nltt  16249 is a da+dq(n ) double degenerate system comprised of a normal hydrogen - rich ( nltt  16249b ) and a nitrogen - contaminated dq white dwarf ( nltt  16249a ) .",

    "the 2mass-@xmath41 frame ( epoch 1997 ) clearly shows a se - nw elongation .",

    "we also computed johnson - cousin ubvri magnitudes and color indices of the composite spectra to constrain the best - fit parameters . because of the absence of co spectroscopic signatures we set the oxygen abundance to zero in the dq models .",

    "figure  [ fig_color ] shows composite colors corresponding to the best - fit models with @xmath60 varying from @xmath61 to @xmath62 .",
    "as noted above , higher carbon abundances are compensated with high dq temperatures .",
    "both sets of indices favor a lower carbon abundance @xmath67 and we conclude that the da model parameters are @xmath68 and , correlating with the da parameters , the dq parameters are @xmath69 the total system mass varies between 1.33 , in the lower gravity range , to 1.83@xmath9 , in the higher gravity range .",

    "hydrogen - deficient white dwarfs ( db and dq white dwarfs , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are possibly the product of a late thermal pulse .",
    "this process leads to the formation of a hydrogen - deficient surface that is also enriched in carbon and oxygen ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . after reaching the white dwarf cooling sequence",
    "these objects develop a nearly pure - helium surface and are recognized as db white dwarfs . while cooling further they develop a deep helium - dominated convection zone dredging - up carbon from the core @xcite .",
    "the material mixed in the helium - dominated convection zone of the dq white dwarf nltt  16249a is enriched with carbon and nitrogen .",
    "the diffusion time - scales at the bottom of the helium convection zone of a @xmath83 k white dwarf are relatively short ( @xmath84 yr ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , a steady - state abundance of nitrogen and carbon is achieved only if the carbon / nitrogen - rich material is supplied to the envelope from the core .",
    "this scenario , commonly applied to ordinary carbon - rich dq white dwarfs , should also apply to the peculiar dq nltt  16249a , but the source of nitrogen remains elusive .    a copious amount of nitrogen is produced in intermediate - mass stars between pulses on the agb when the convective envelope reaches the hydrogen - burning shell @xcite .",
    "this production is deemed responsible for nitrogen enrichment in planetary nebulae @xcite , but what fraction of it would remain within the helium envelope and contribute to the white dwarf core composition is an open question .",
    "nitrogen leftover material is present in the early - stages of helium burning on the horizontal - branch ( hb ) , but it is quickly destroyed along with helium leading to the formation of a carbon / oxygen - rich core .",
    "for example , a carbon - to - nitrogen ratio of @xmath0 is briefly achieved in the core of 2 @xmath9  hb star after @xmath85 myr , but it rapidly declines afterward @xcite . at this particular stage",
    "the core composition is 64.4% he , 27.6% c , 0.6% n , and 7.4% o by mass , but by the end of the helium burning phase the remainder consists mostly of oxygen ( 83.6% by mass ) and carbon ( 12.7% ) without a trace of nitrogen .",
    "prior to helium ignition and on the rgb the carbon - to - nitrogen number ratio in the core is only @xmath86 . at higher masses and up to 9 @xmath9  nitrogen is destroyed even more rapidly during the core helium - burning phase , and on the rgb the carbon - to - nitrogen number ratio in the core never rises above @xmath87 .",
    "should burning be terminated while on the rgb , nitrogen would dominate carbon in a helium - rich core .",
    "we found that the dq nltt  16249a is part of a close double degenerate system .",
    "binary evolutionary scenarios ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that , normally , the mass of helium - core white dwarfs correlate with the double - degenerate orbital period and almost never exceed 0.4 @xmath9 .",
    "our spectral decomposition suggests a dq mass larger than @xmath88 @xmath9 . applying the schnberg - chandrasekhar mass limit to the case of a helium core and helium / hydrogen envelope",
    ", the core mass on the rbg could reach @xmath89 prior to collapse and ignition , i.e. , @xmath90 @xmath9  in the case of a @xmath91 @xmath9  star .",
    "in order to conceal a large helium - rich core the dq white dwarf in nltt  16249 would have to be the product of such exceptional circumstances .    based on our spectral decomposition",
    "we find that the stars have comparable luminosities with similar masses and cooling ages .",
    "in the lower mass range the cooling ages are @xmath92 gyr and @xmath93 gyr so that the da may have preceded the dq by @xmath94 myr , but in the higher mass range the situation is reversed with @xmath95 gyr and @xmath96 gyr . in either case , the progenitors would follow each other off the main - sequence within 200 myr or less . the maximum age differential could apply to initial masses of 3 and 4 @xmath9 , or in a lower mass range to initial masses of 2.0 and 2.2 @xmath9  ( see * ? ? ? * ) . narrowing",
    "the age differential would accommodate even larger initial masses and we can not exclude the possibility of a @xmath91 @xmath9progenitor for the dq white dwarf although it is less likely than a 2 - 4 @xmath9  progenitor .",
    "moreover , a high - mass progenitor for the 0.6 - 0.9 @xmath9  da white dwarf is also unlikely @xcite .",
    "therefore , nltt  16249 is most probably a co@xmath97co system with the da forming first , and the dq forming next during a common - envelope phase ; the progenitor masses would be in the 2 - 4 @xmath9  range .",
    "the question of the source of nitrogen remains .",
    "so far , we considered the composition at the center of the star as representative of the core . as pointed out by @xcite in the case of oxygen , the material actually dredged - up is not located at the core center but , instead , below the former helium - burning shell .",
    "therefore , we propose that helium burning terminated prematurely during a common - envelope phase leaving an abundance ratio c / n@xmath14 off - center and below the former helium - burning shell in nltt  16249a . in conclusion",
    ", the presence of nitrogen in the atmosphere of dq white dwarfs would help distinguish normal dq white dwarfs that evolved in isolation and dq white dwarfs that are the product of binary evolution .",
    "we report the discovery of a peculiar dq white dwarf in a close degenerate system ( @xmath2 hrs ) .",
    "the presence of nitrogen in the atmosphere of the dq also suggests the presence of unprocessed material in the core of the star , most probably off - center and below the extinct helium - burning shell .",
    "helium burning may have been interrupted following a common - envelope event leaving a nitrogen - rich layer above a normal carbon / oxygen core .",
    "our spectral decomposition suggests a system mass in the 1.3 to 1.8 @xmath9  range with cooling ages between 1.3 and 2.6 gyr depending on the mass .",
    "the binary will merge within 9 gyr for a system mass of 1.3 @xmath9 , or 13 gyr for 1.8 @xmath9  following @xcite .",
    "new radial velocity measurements will be used to set a precise binary mass ratio and confirm the evolutionary prospects of the binary nltt  16249 .",
