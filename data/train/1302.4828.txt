    "the properties of thermodynamics of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , which relate to the experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , have attracted a great deal of attention recently .",
    "the strongly correlated quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) produced from rhic involves many non - perturbative problems of qcd , such as chiral symmetry breaking and restoration , deconfinement phase transition , qcd phase diagram and so on .",
    "many theoretical tools have been developed to describe those phenomena : effective qcd theories such as effective chiral dynamical model ( cdm ) @xcite of low energy qcd , qcd sum rules and lattice qcd .",
    "although the effective cdm can provide well prediction for the mass spectra of ground state mesons , it is hard to characterize the linear trajectory behavior for the higher excited resonance meson states .",
    "when it comes to the dense matter situation , the lattice qcd calculation encounters difficulties for the sign problem in nonzero chemical potential case .    in the framework of the gauge / gravity duality approach @xcite",
    ", the holographic qcd has been developed to bring new light on solving the problem of nonperturbative qcd .",
    "searching the bulk gravity theory which corresponds to realistic qcd was first pursued in @xcite .",
    "mainly there are two complementary ways to follow : the top - down approach and the bottom - up approach .",
    "the former starts with the string solutions and find the brane configuration for the dual gravity to reproduce some basic qcd features , e.g. @xmath3 @xcite , @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the latter known as a phenomenological ads / qcd model consists of a gauge theory in a curved space with some field contents which are dual to some operators in qcd .",
    "the so - called hard - wall ads / qcd model with a sharp infrared ( ir ) cut off @xmath6 metric was developed firstly in refs .",
    "@xcite . it can correctly realize the chiral symmetry breaking and low - lying mesons states , while the higher excited states of hadrons were found to deviate the regge trajectory .",
    "then the soft - wall ads / qcd model @xcite was constructed to remedy this drawback by introducing a background dilaton field which suppresses the action gradually at ir region . applying the wkb approximation analysis ,",
    "it was shown that the dilaton s quadratic behavior at ir region will lead to the regge trajectory for the excited meson spectra .",
    "however , the chiral condensation in the soft - wall model was found to be proportional to quark mass .",
    "a large amount of works have been done to incorporate both the chiral symmetry breaking and the linear trajectory of excited meson spectra in the ads / qcd model . in @xcite",
    ", a quartic interaction term has been introduced into the action in soft - wall model to realize the explicit and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking , while such a term was shown to cause an instability of the scalar potential and a negative mass for the lowest lying scalar meson state . in refs .",
    "@xcite , by simply modifying the bulk gravity at ir region , a consistent soft - wall ads / qcd model has been constructed and the resulting mass spectra for light resonance states have been found to agree with the experimental data .",
    "it is also interesting to investigate the finite temperature and density properties in the ads / qcd model .",
    "the hard - wall s finite temperature effects was studied in @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the scalar glueball and light scalar mesons spectral have been studied in the soft - wall model and the highest temperature for which the meson state can exist was found to be about @xmath7 .",
    "compared with the hawking - page ( hp ) transition temperature in the soft - wall model , which was found to be @xmath8 in @xcite , the meson states dissociation occurs in the confined qcd phase , which is far from the deconfinement transition .",
    "one way to increase the temperature is to set up a different mass scale in the soft - wall model . in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath9 thermal spectral function was studied by treating the scale as a flavor - dependent parameter . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the melting of @xmath9 spectral peak was found to occur at @xmath10 .",
    "however , the light mesons dissociation temperature is still too low . the chemical potential is another interesting properties , which has been widely investigated in holographic qcd . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the spectral functions have been studied by taking d3/d7 setup with fundamental matters at finite baryon density .",
    "density effects on the spectral function in the soft - wall model have been discussed in @xcite .    in @xcite , we extended the the ir - improved soft - wall @xcite to a thermodynamic model at finite temperature .",
    "spectral functions of vector and axial - vector mesons have been computed . the highest temperature for which the meson state can survive",
    "was found to be around @xmath11 without quartic interaction term .",
    "however , difficulty remains in obtaining the spectral function of pseudo - scalar meson due to the coupling between the axial - vector field and the pseudo - scalar field . in this paper",
    ", we only pay attention to the pseudoscalar and scalar mesons .",
    "we construct the soft - wall ads / qcd model which works well in both zero temperature and finite temperature region for the pseudoscalar and scalar mesons . in sec .",
    "[ chap : model ] , inspired by refs .",
    "@xcite , we will build a thermodynamic model for scalar part by introducing a modified reissner - nordstrom ads black hole . in sec .",

    "in this section , we will construct a phenomenological thermodynamic ads / qcd model inspired by the predictive holographic qcd model @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    ", we studied the spectral functions of the vector and axial - vector mesons .",
    "however , the pseudo - scalar part is the most intriguing one due to the coupling with axial - vector field . as our main goal is to investigate the finite temperature effects",
    ", we will consider the simple case by taking off the gauge field part and focus only on scalar and pseudo - scalar part in the 5d action .",

    ", we need to find a dual geometry in the bulk .",
    "according to ads / cft correspondence , the quark chemical potential , which is the coefficient of the quark number operator @xmath23 , corresponds to the time - component of @xmath24 gauge field in the bulk . the gravity action which describes the interaction of the @xmath24 gauge field with the ads space",

    "in this paper , we will adopt a modified reissner - nordstrom ads black hole inspired by the one introduced in @xcite .",
    "@xmath29 in order to incorporate both chiral symmetry breaking and linear confinement , the ir region of the metric is modified as : @xmath30 here @xmath31 is a constant mass scale which characterizes qcd confinement .",

    "when temperature and chemical potential are turned on , the equation of motion is given as follows in momentum space by performing the fourier transformation(we put three - momentum to zero @xmath47 ) : @xmath48    as the temperature and density increase , the horizon of black hole @xmath49 moves from infinity to boundary side .",
    "solutions of equations of motion drop into black hole before they vanish",
    ". therefore we can not use the method of finding eigenmode .",
    "alternatively , we will investigate spectral function which is the imaginary part of the retarded green s function .",

    "on the other hand , near the horizon , we take the in - falling boundary condition which corresponds to retarded green s function @xcite : @xmath56 the solutions of equation of motions can be expressed by the combination of the two independent asymptotic solutions .",
    "the coefficients @xmath57 and @xmath58 will be fixed by the ir in - falling boundary condition : @xmath59    the on shell action of scalar field part reduces to surface terms : @xmath60 following the prescription in @xcite , after substitute eq .",
    "[ asym solu ] into surface terms , we find that the spectral function which relates to the imaginary part of two point retarded green function is proportional to the imaginary part of @xmath61 .",
    "the results for pseudo - scalar part is the same .",
    "@xmath62    let us now make a numerical calculation .",
    "as we have discussed in @xcite , @xmath63 and @xmath64 play the role as regulators to regulate the singular behavior near the horizon , which have no effect on finite temperature and density behavior . in principle , we should assign their values as small as possible , while it turns out to be more difficult if we adopt extremely small values in practical calculation . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have computed the quark number susceptibility at finite temperature by taking the limit that momentum and frequency are eventually taken to be zero . in this case , the modified terms which contain @xmath63 and @xmath64 can be neglected . in this paper , we take @xmath65 .      in fig .",
    "[ fig lamda ] , we turn off chemical potential and check the finite temperature behavior in scalar and pseudo - scalar channel . as the temperature increases , the horizon @xmath49 approaches boundary so that both scalar and pseudo - scalar mesons become unstable and melt . for the low temperature ,",
    "the positions of the peaks are in accord with the masses which have been given in zero temperature case in table .",
    "increasing temperature , the peaks are shifted towards smaller values and the widths become broader .",
    "we can define a melting point , where no peak can be distinguished above this temperature .",
    "quantitatively , melting temperature can be determined from the breit - wigner form as showed below in eq .",
    "[ bwform].that is if the continuum part @xmath68 is larger than the height of the peak , then it can be considered that no mesons state exist .",
    "so the temperature @xmath69 or @xmath70(@xmath71 ) can be taken as the critical temperature of dissolution of mesons state . here",
    "the critical temperature @xmath72 without the quartic term is consistent with other njl models predictions @xcite , and also with the one obtained from the melting point for thermal mass spectra of the vector and axial - vector mesons@xcite .",
    "the value @xmath70 with the quartic term approaches to the critical temperature yielded from the quark number susceptibility when the phase changes from the hadron phase to the quark - gluon - plasma phase at zero chemical potential@xcite , and also to the one from the lattice qcd calculations@xcite",

[ mass shift ] .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ mass shift ] that in the low temperature region the location of the peak drops linearly as temperature increases .",

    "the lower the temperature is , the more difficult the numerical analysis is .",
    "this is because the horizon @xmath49 becomes too large and the method can not be used anymore at very low temperature .",
