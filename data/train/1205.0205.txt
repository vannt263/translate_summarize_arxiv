    "radon ( @xmath1rn ) is a radioactive inert gas formed from the disintegration of @xmath2ra as part of the @xmath3u decay chain .",
    "it occurs with varying concentrations in the geological environment , and is widely used for tracking temporally varying geological processes @xcite .",
    "the nature of the physical processes driving the temporal patterns observed in @xmath1rn time series is not clear , particularly the extent to which environmental parameters , such as temperature , atmospheric pressure , and humidity , can influence the @xmath1rn level @xcite . to help understand these processes , steinitz et al .",
    "have carried out experiments that track the variation of alpha and gamma radiation arising from a source of @xmath1rn in a closed volume of air @xcite . in this article",
    ", we analyze a sequence of 28,733 measurements of gamma radiation acquired in this experiment over the time interval 28 january 2007 to 10 may 2010 .",
    "the experimental setup is described briefly in appendix a , and environmental drivers of radon production are discussed in appendix b.    in section 2 , we present the gross features of the data sequence , which exhibits a strong dependence on time of day and time of year .",
    "we also show similar displays of the laboratory temperature and of the solar elevation , finding a stronger correlation of the gamma - detector measurements with the latter than with the former . in section 3",
    "we present an analysis of the measurements in terms of frequency and time of day , finding that most of the modulation is associated with nighttime measurements .",
    "for this reason , we also present separate power - spectrum analyses of the daytime and nighttime measurements . in section 4 , we compare these results with those of our previous time - series analyses of bnl and ptb data @xcite , and we comment on a recent study of the decay rate of @xmath4cs in an experiment carried out at the gran sasso laboratory @xcite .",
    "our results are discussed in section 5 .",
    "the mean daily count rate of photons detected by the gamma detector is @xmath5 .",
    "these counts are due primarily to the beta decay of @xmath6pb and of @xmath6bi , but there are other sources of gamma rays in the @xmath1rn decay chain , and one can not rule out that some counts may be due to the decay of the other @xmath1rn daughters .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1 ] shows a plot of the daily count , normalized to mean value unity , as a function of time . since the early values are anomalous , we exclude them from further consideration .    ]",
    "we next remove fluctuations on the time scale of one day by forming 21-point running means . figure 2 shows the percentage departure from the mean value ( unity ) .",
    "the dominant feature is an annual modulation , with a peak at mid - summer .",
    "however , it is notable that there is also a minor peak near mid - winter .    ]    due to the experimental setup and location , it is reasonable to suspect that an annual modulation may have an environmental origin .",
    "we therefore show comparable plots derived from the absolute temperature ( mean value 291.87 k ) in figure 3 ; pressure ( mean value 923.78 milli - bar ) in figure 4 ; and line voltage ( mean value 13.403 volts ) in figure 5 .    ]    ]    ]    pressure shows little annual variation , but temperature and voltage both show annual modulations with amplitudes and phases comparable with that of the gamma - detector measurements , except that the voltage curve is in anti - phase .",
    "table [ tab : tbl1 ] lists the amplitude of the sine - wave component of each of these wave - forms , together with the phase - of - year of the maximum and the phase - of - year of the minimum for each sine - wave fit .",
    "we see that the amplitudes of the temperature and voltage variations are comparable with that of the gamma - detector measurements .",
    "however , even allowing for an inversion of the voltage curve , the phases differ by over one month",
    ". such a large phase shift would be difficult to understand if the annual variation of the gamma - detector measurements were caused by the annual variations of either the temperature or the voltage .",

    "[ fig : fig16 ] ]    it is interesting , and possibly significant , that the frequencies of the 8th and 7th peaks ( 11.27 year@xmath0 and 5.54 year@xmath0 ) are in close to a 2:1 ratio .    in previous analyses of decay data @xcite , we have evaluated the significance of a peak in the rotational search band by using the shuffle test @xcite .",
    "we have therefore carried out 1,000 shuffle simulations of the nighttime data , with the result shown in histogram form in figure 17 .",
    "the largest value of the power generated in this way is 9.35 , far below the actual value of 49.63 .",
    "hence there is no possibility that the oscillations are the result of independent random fluctuations in the measurements .    ]",
    "it is clear from figures 15 and 16 that the nighttime data contains oscillations that are not present , or only weakly present , in the daytime data , and that the difference between the daytime and nighttime power spectra is statistically significant .",
    "it is interesting to compare the results of our analysis of the gsi data with the results of similar analyses of the bnl ( brookhaven national laboratory ) data @xcite and ptb ( physikalisch - technische bundenanstalt ) @xcite data .",
    "we have previously shown the results of simple power - spectrum analyses of these two datasets @xcite . however , to facilitate visual comparison with our present analysis of gsi data ,",

    "we see that all four datasets lead to oscillations in the two bands 11.0 to 11.4 year@xmath0 and 12.1 to 12.9 year@xmath0 .",
    "it should be noted that the bnl and ptb oscillations are intermittent in amplitude , and drift somewhat in frequency , but we nevertheless see broad agreement among oscillation patterns in all four displays .",
    "bellotti et al . have recently reported the result of measurements of the activity of a @xmath4cs source , as determined by an experiment installed deep underground in the gran sasso laboratory @xcite , finding no evidence of variability in that dataset .",
    "this result is not inconsistent with our studies to date , which have shown that ( a ) not all nuclides exhibit variability ; and ( b ) among nuclides that do exhibit variability , the patterns of variability are not all the same .",
    "the patterns we see in the gsi radon measurements are so striking as to be quite incompatible with the textbook picture that nuclear decay rates are all constant .",
    "the first question to be addressed is the extent to which the variations have an environmental or experimental origin .",
    "figures 6 , 7 , 8 and 9 show that the gross variations of the gamma - detector measurements are quite similar to those of the ambient temperature .",
    "however , the annual waveform of the gamma - detector measurements leads rather than lags that of the ambient temperature .",
    "this makes it unlikely that the annual variation of the decay rates is due completely to the variation in the ambient temperature .",
    "figure 7 shows that the annual waveform of the gamma - detector measurements also leads that of the voltage .",
    "hence it is also unlikely that the annual variation of the decay rates is completely due to the voltage variation .    on the other hand , comparison of figures 9 and 10 shows that the annual variation of the gamma - detector measurements lags that of the solar elevation ,",
    "which is compatible with the possibility that the annual variation of decay rates may be due to a direct solar influence rather than a secondary environmental influence .",
    "note , however , that figure 10 represents not only the maximum elevation as seen at the site of the experiment , but also the maximum elevation as it would be seen at the diametrically opposite position on earth .",
    "the frequency - hour - of - day displays in figures 11 , 12 , and 13 show that the annual oscillation is primarily a daytime effect , but all other oscillations are primarily nighttime effects .",
    "it may turn out that this curious property of the time series is due to some experimental or environmental effect , but we have so far failed to identify such an effect .",
    "if this pattern proves not to be attributable to an experimental or environmental effect , indicating that it is an intrinsic property of the decay process , we would find it difficult to avoid the conclusion that the relevant decay process is anisotropic .",
    "there would then be a clear need for a dedicated experiment that could distinguish between isotropy and anisotropy .",
    "we have noted in our earlier analyses @xcite of bnl and ptb data @xcite that the above oscillation frequencies are too low to be attributable to rotation in either the convection zone or the radiative zone , leading to the suggestion that the solar core may rotate more slowly than the outer layers .",
    "this conjecture leads in turn to the suggestion that there may be an inner tachocline ( a region involving a sharp gradient in the rotation rate ) that separates the core from the radiative zone , analogous to the well known outer tachocline that separates the radiative zone from the convection zone .",
    "an equatorial section of the outer tachocline extends over the frequency range 13.7 to 14.7 year@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the above similarity between the gsi oscillation frequencies and those found in bnl and ptb data further supports our proposal that nuclear decay rates are influenced by solar radiation that is somehow influenced by processes in the deep solar interior .",
    "this leads us to look for a form of radiation that has two ( apparently contradictory ) properties : ( a ) the radiation can traverse the solar radiative and convection zones ( and presumably the earth ) without being absorbed , and ( b ) the radiation can be modulated by processes in the deep solar interior and retain that modulation in the course of its passage through the solar interior .",
    "these two requirements can be met by neutrinos : the cross section for scattering of neutrinos by normal matter is estimated to be extremely small , so that one would expect there to be negligible absorption of the neutrino flux in its propagation from the core to earth .",
    "however , there are believed to be at least three types of neutrinos involving the three flavors electron , muon , and tau .",
    "an inhomogeneous magnetic field ( and magnetic fields are necessarily inhomogeneous ) can lead to flavor oscillations by the rsfp ( resonant spin flavor precession ) process @xcite .",
    "one can imagine that such a modulation might be imprinted on the neutrino flux in the deep solar interior and remain imprinted in the flux during its passage through the outer layers of the sun .",
    "the obvious and crucial objection to this proposal is that there is no known mechanism by which neutrinos can influence beta decays .",
    "further experiments and future theoretical work will hopefully lead to a resolution of this paradox .",
