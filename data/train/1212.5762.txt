    "the winds driven from the accretion disc through the magnetic field lines threading the disc have been considered as promising explanations for jets / outflows observed in different types of the sources , such as , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , x - ray binaries , and young stellar objects ( see reviews in * ? ? ?",

    ". in this model , the ordered magnetic field co - rotates with the gases in the disc , and a small fraction of the gases are driven along the field line by the centrifugal force @xcite .",
    "the jets are powered by the rotational kinetic energy of the disc through the ordered field threading the accretion disc in this scenario",
    ". a crucial ingredient of this model is the angle of the field line inclined to the midplane of the disc being less than @xmath3 is required for launching jets from the mid - plane of the keplerian cold disc @xcite .",
    "this critical angle could be larger than @xmath4 for the accretion disc surrounding a rapidly spinning black hole @xcite , which indicates that the spin of black hole may help launching jets centrifugally by cold magnetized discs .",
    "such analyses were carried out based on two assumptions , the gas is cold ( i.e. , without considering its internal energy ) , and the gas is initially launched from the midplane of a keplerian accretion disc .",
    "strictly speaking , the circular motion of the gases in the accretion disc always deviates from keplerian motion in the presence of a large - scale magnetic field , which usually exerts a radial force against the gravitation of the central object , and the accretion disc threaded by ordered magnetic field lines is therefore always sub - keplerian .",
    "the gases are dominantly accelerated by the centrifugal force , which is proportional to @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the radius of the magnetic field line footpoint , and @xmath7 is the angular velocity of the accretion disc ) .",
    "a strong magnetic field is helpful for launching the gases , while the stronger field leads to a lower circular velocity of the gas in the disc , which decreases the mass loss rate in the outflow or even suppresses the outflow .",
    "such effects on the launch of the outflow have been extensively explored in the previous works .",
    "it was also suggested that the outflow can be accelerated by the radiation pressure of the disc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite performed numerical simulations on the radiation - driven winds from a luminous keplerian accretion disc threaded by a strong large - scale ordered magnetic field .",
    "it is found that the radiation force is essential in producing winds from the disc if the thermal energy of the gas is low or the field lines make an angle of greater than 60@xmath8 with respect to the disc midplane .",
    "the numerical simulations carried out in @xcite are limited to the keplerian accretion discs .",
    "recently , the global structure of the accretion discs and outflows around black holes was investigated with radiation - magnetohydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "similar investigations were carried out for the cases of massive young stars by @xcite .",
    "it is found that the magnetic force , together with the radiation force exerted by accretion discs , can efficiently drive outflows from luminous accretion discs .",
    "it is believed that the black holes are accreting at high rates in narrow - line seyfert i galaxies ( nls1s ) , some young radio galaxies , and microquasars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    ", relativistic jets are present in their high - luminosity states ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "the outflows / jets in these sources accreting at high rates may probably be magnetically launched from the radiation pressure - dominated accretion discs .    in this work ,",
    "we explore the condition for cold gas driven by the magnetic force and the radiation force from the surface of a radiation pressure dominated accretion disc .",
    "the disc structure , especially the circular motion velocity of the gases in the disc , is altered in the presence of a strong large - scale ordered magnetic field threading the disc , which is properly considered in this work .",
    "we describe our analyses in sections 2 and 3 , and the results and discussion are in sections 4 and 5 .",
    "the accretion disc is assumed to be hydrodynamical equilibrium in the vertical direction . for the gas pressure - dominated accretion disc ,",
    "the gradient of the gas pressure is balanced with the gravity and magnetic force due to the curvature of the field in the vertical direction . however , the situation is slightly different for the radiation pressure - dominated accretion disc , the vertical component of gravitational force of the black hole is balanced with the radiation pressure of the disc and the vertical component of the magnetic force at the disc surface @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the curvature of the field line at the disc surface is usually very small , and the vertical component of the magnetic force can be neglected in the estimate of the disc scale - height .",
    "the scale - height of the disc can be estimated with @xmath10 which can be re - written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the flux from the unit surface area of the disc , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the keplerian angular velocity at @xmath6 .    in a geometrically thin accretion disc ,",
    "the circular velocity is almost keplerian without magnetic fields .",
    "the circular motion of the disc becomes sub - keplerian in the presence of magnetic fields , and the angular velocity @xmath7 of the disc can be calculated with @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the surface density of the disc , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the radial and vertical components of the field at the disc surface @xmath9 respectively , and @xmath19 .",
    "the radial gradient of radiation pressure in the disc is not included in equation ( [ omega_1 ] ) , which is negligible compared with the magnetic force in the thin accretion disc if the magnetic field is sufficient strong .",
    "the pressure of a radiation pressure dominated accretion disc at the mid - plane is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the central temperature of the disc .",
    "the flux radiated from the unit area of the disc surface is given by @xmath22 equation ( [ p_d_1 ] ) can therefore be re - written as @xmath23 substituting equations ( [ vertical_2 ] ) , ( [ p_d_1 ] ) , and ( [ f_rad_1 ] ) into equation ( [ omega_1 ] ) , we have @xmath24 where the dimensionless quantities @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , are defined as @xmath27",
    "the condition for the cold gas can be launched from the midplane of a keplerian accretion disc was given in @xcite , which is a good approximation for geometrically thin accretion discs with weak magnetic fields , i.e. , the rotation of the discs has not been altered much by the field .",
    "the situation becomes complicated for the gas driven from the surface of a real disc with finite thickness in the presence of a strong magnetic field . in this case , the rotation of the gas in the disc deviates significantly from the keplerian value ( see discussion in section 2 ) .    the effective potential along the field line threading the accretion disc with angular velocity @xmath7 at radius @xmath6 is @xmath28 without considering the radiation force exerted on the gas in the outflow .",
    "it becomes @xmath29 while the radiation pressure is considered , where @xmath12 is the flux emitted from the unit surface area of the disc , and the thompson scattering cross - section @xmath30 . for the outflow from the inner region of the disc , the gases are almost completely ionized and the thompson scattering cross - section is therefore a good approximation .",
    "the analysis carried out in this work can be applied to the outflow driven by the radiation pressure due to the line absorption if the thompson scattering cross - section is replaced by the line opacity , though line driven outflows are usually from the outer region of the disc ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "substituting equation ( [ vertical_2 ] ) into equation ( [ potent_eff_1 ] ) , the effective potential along the field line threading the accretion disc with angular velocity @xmath7 at radius @xmath6 can be re - written in dimensionless form , @xmath31 @xmath32 where @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "differentiating equation ( [ potent_eff_2 ] ) , we have @xmath35 which reduces to @xmath36 at the disc surface , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "this means that the cold gas can be magnetically launched from the disc surface with the help of radiation pressure only if the condition , @xmath39 is satisfied , which requires @xmath40 substituting equation ( [ omega_2 ] ) into equation ( [ condi_coldgas2 ] ) , the condition becomes @xmath41,\\label{condi_coldgas3}\\ ] ] for the cold gas being able to leave the disc surface along the field line . in order to clarify the role of the radiation force in launching the jets / outflows , we analyze two special cases : a @xmath42 and @xmath43 ; and , b @xmath44 is not considered and @xmath45 .      in our model ,",
    "the circular velocity of the accretion discs deviates from the keplerian value in the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "a lower @xmath26 leads to a larger angular velocity @xmath25 for a fixed value of @xmath1 ( see equation [ omega_2 ] ) , which helps launching the outflow .",
    "the results derived here are different from that derived in @xcite for the gas driven from the midplane of a keplerian disc",
    ". one may expect that our calculation can reproduce the blandford - payne s result on the critical angle of the field line with respect to the disc plane , below which the cold gas can be launched from the mid - plane of a keplerian disc . for a radiation pressure",
    "dominated accretion disc , the gravity of the black hole is balanced with the radiation pressure of the disc in the vertical direction , which means that the disc thickness @xmath48 in the limit of @xmath42 ( see equation [ vertical_2 ] ) , and @xmath43 is automatically satisfied ( see equation [ omega_2 ] ) .",
    "thus , our model calculation corresponds to the case considered in @xcite for the cold gas from the midplane of a keplerian disc in the limit of @xmath49 .",
    "we find that @xmath50 if @xmath51 ( see equation [ dpsi_eff_dr2 ] ) .",
    "it implies that the gas can always be in equilibrium independent of the field line inclination @xmath1 .",
    "this is the same as that in @xcite .",
    "therefore , one has to calculate the second derivative of the effective potential to check the stability of equilibrium , @xmath52 which is required to be negative at @xmath37 and @xmath53 for the cold gas can be launched from the midplane of the disc .",
    "this leads to @xmath54 which reaches the same result given in @xcite .",
    "our calculations show that gas at the disc surface is not in equilibrium state when the angular velocity is greater than a critical value for the disc with finite thickness , and therefore the launch condition for the cold gas at the disc surface can be derived by the first derivative of the effective potential @xmath55 at @xmath9 .      in most of the previous work ,",
    "the effect of the radiation force exerted by the accretion disc on the outflow / jet has not been considered , while this effect is included in this work .",
    "we leave out the radiation pressure term , and re - analyze the effective potential along the field line .",
    "the analysis carried out here is in principle inconsistent with the assumption of the radiation pressure dominated accretion discs .",
    "however , the analysis is only limited to the condition of the gas being able to leave the system , which is almost independent of the disc structure .",
    "it illustrates the role of the radiation pressure in launching the outflow from the surface of the disc .",
    "the effective potential along the field line threading the accretion disc with angular velocity @xmath7 at radius @xmath6 can be written in dimensionless form , @xmath57 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and , the term due to the radiation force in equation ( [ potent_eff_2 ] ) is omitted .",
    "differentiating equation ( [ potent_eff_2nr ] ) , the condition for the cold gas being able to leave the disc surface is available , @xmath58 and we derive the lower limit on the angular velocity of the disc as @xmath59 the constraint of the magnetic field strength is available , @xmath60 , \\label{condi_coldgasnr3}\\ ] ] by substituting equation ( [ omega_2 ] ) into equation ( [ condi_coldgasnr2 ] ) .",
    "it is found that the critical angular velocity of the disc , above which the cold gas can be launched from the disc surface , should be greater than the keplerian value when @xmath1 is sufficiently large ( see equation [ condi_coldgasnr ] ) , if the role of the radiation force on the outflow is not considered . in the case of the radiation force",
    "being properly considered , we find that the critical angular velocity of the disc is always lower than the keplerian value ( see equation [ condi_coldgas2 ] ) .",
    "it implies that the radiation force can help for launching the gas from the disc surface .",
    "we note that @xmath61 when @xmath51 from equation ( [ condi_coldgasnr ] ) .",
    "as discussed above , the second derivative of the effective potential @xmath62 at @xmath37 and @xmath63 is required for the cold gas being able to leave .",
    "the last term in the first derivative of the effective potential ( equation [ dpsi_eff_dr1 ] ) is left out when the role of the radiation force on the outflow is not considered .",
    "this term remains constant along the field line , and the second derivative of the effective potential has the same form as equation ( [ d2psi_eff_dr21 ] ) .",
    "thus , our analysis without considering radiation pressure can also reproduce the same result in @xcite when @xmath64 .",
    "as discussed in section 2 , the angular velocity of the gas in the accretion disc is dependent on the magnetic field strength @xmath26 and the inclination of the field line @xmath1 at the disc surface .",
    "we plot the angular velocities of the accretion disc as functions of @xmath26 and @xmath1 with different values of @xmath65 in figure [ kappa_omega ] .",
    "it is found that the angular velocity @xmath25 increases with field line inclination @xmath1 at the disc surface .",
    "for the fixed value of @xmath1 , the angular velocity @xmath25 increases with magnetic field strength @xmath26 .",
    "the launch of the cold gas in the disc is governed by the effective potential barrier , and the cold gas can be launched from the disc surface along the field line if the angular velocity of the gas in the disc is larger than a critical value ( see equation [ condi_coldgas2 ] ) , which is plotted in figure [ hd_omega ] . the critical angular velocity @xmath66 decreases with increasing disc thickness @xmath65 .",
    "as @xmath25 is a function of @xmath26 , @xmath1 and @xmath65 , the conditions of the cold gas can be launched from the disc surface are available as functions of @xmath1 and @xmath26 with given @xmath65 ( see figure [ kappa_beta_crit ] ) .",
    "there are upper limits on the magnetic field strength , which increase with the field inclination @xmath1 and disc thickness @xmath65 . for comparison",
    ", we also plot the results without considering the effect of radiation pressure from the disc in the same figure .",
    "we find more strict constraints on the magnetic field strength .",
    "the cold gas can be launched from the disc surface only if the field line is bent close to the disc surface .",
    "we investigate the launch of the gas from the disc surface by the field lines threading a radiation pressure - dominated accretion disc , in which the effect of the radiation pressure from the accretion disc is considered .",
    "the launch of the outflow is sensitive to the rotational angular velocity of the gas in the disc , which is determined by the balance between the gravity of the black hole and the magnetic force .",
    "the angular velocity of the disc is a function of the field line inclination @xmath1 at the disc surface and @xmath26 ( the ratio of the magnetic pressure to the radiation pressure in the disc ) , if the relative disc thickness @xmath65 is specified ( see figure [ kappa_omega ] ) .",
    "it is not surprising that the angular velocity of the gas in the disc @xmath25 decreases with increasing field strength @xmath26 , if the values of all other parameters are fixed .",
    "the angular velocity @xmath25 becomes smaller for the field line inclined at a smaller angle with respect to the disc surface , which is caused by a stronger magnetic force for a smaller @xmath1 .",
    "we find that the angular velocity @xmath25 decreases with increasing relative disc thickness @xmath65 for the same values of @xmath26 and @xmath1 .",
    "similar to the discussion in @xcite , we investigate the condition for the cold gas can be launched from the disc surface . in the presence of magnetic fields ,",
    "the rotational velocity of the gas in the disc is sub - keplerian , which makes the gas being more difficult to leave the disc surface than the keplerian case @xcite . in this work",
    ", we include the effect of radiation pressure in launching the outflow .",
    "we find that the cold gas can be magnetically driven from the disc surface if the angular velocity of the disc greater than a critical value @xmath66 ( see figure [ hd_omega ] ) , which is a function of the disc thickness @xmath65 . for the radiation pressure dominated accretion disc , the disc thickness @xmath65 describes the importance of radiation pressure ( see equation [ vertical_2 ] ) .",
    "it is found that the critical value of @xmath66 decreases with increasing @xmath65 , which indicates that the force exerted by the radiation from the disc indeed helps launching the outflow .",
    "the angular velocity of the gas in the disc is determined by the field strength and the inclination of the field line at the disc surface , and therefore the condition of the cold gas can be launched becomes a function of @xmath1 and @xmath26 ( see figure [ kappa_beta_crit ] ) .",
    "for the given magnetic field line inclination @xmath1 , the cold gas can be driven from the disc surface only if the field strength is lower than a certain value ( see equation [ condi_coldgas3 ] ) .",
    "this is because a higher @xmath26 leads to a lower angular velocity @xmath25 for a fixed value of @xmath1 .",
    "it is found that the launch of the cold outflow is suppressed if the magnetic field is too strong , which is due to the decrease of @xmath25 with increasing @xmath26 . for a relatively thick disc ,",
    "the upper limit on the field strength could be high because the cold flow can be launched from the disc surface with a relatively low @xmath25 with the help of the radiation force .",
    "this implies a more strict constraint on the maximal jet power can be extracted from a radiation pressure dominated accretion disc than that derived conventionally on the equipartition assumption .    in figure [ kappa_beta_crit ]",
    ", we also plot the results without considering the effect of the radiation pressure exerted by the accretion disc , i.e. , the radiation pressure term is left out in the effective potential , in order to explore the role of the radiation pressure in launching the ouflow .",
    "it is found that the cold gas can be launched from the disc surface only if @xmath1 is small , i.e. , the angle of the field line inclined with respect to the disc surface is small , if the radiation pressure term is not included .",
    "this implies that the role of the radiation pressure in launching an outflow is important even for thin accretion discs .",
    "the analyses in this work are carried out on the assumption of a radiation pressure dominated accretion disc , which is justified in the inner region of the accretion disc if the accretion rate is not very low ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the calculations are done only for the cold gas driven from the disc surface , because the outflow can be efficiently driven from the place near the disc surface where the magnetic pressure is dominant over the gas pressure .",
    "the structure of the disc in the presence of a magnetic field is complicated , which should be considered by solving the differential equations governing the vertical structure of the disc and its magnetic field consistently . such calculations without considering the effect of radiation force have already been given in the previous works @xcite .",
    "the similar investigations incorporated with the effect of radiation force are beyond the scope of this paper , which will be reported in our future work .    in most of the mhd simulations ,",
    "the accretion flows have relative large thickness , and the gas is launched from the magnetic pressure dominated region near the disc surface ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "their the rotational velocities deviate from the keplerian value mainly due to the magnetic force and gas pressure gradient in the radial direction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our present analysis on the gas launched from the disc surface describes the situation more akin to the numerical simulations than that in @xcite , which is valid only for the gas launched from the midplane of a keplerian disc .",
    "the radiation of the accretion flows are calculated in some previous works based on the structure given by mhd simulations , which are used to explain the observations .",
    "however , the radiation from the accretion flows has not been considered in these mhd simulations .",
    "the role of the radiation pressure on the magnetically outflows has been explored in a few mhd simulations @xcite , but limited to the keplerian disc case .",
    "the recent radiation - magnetohydrodynamic simulations on the accretion discs and outflows around black holes show that the radiation force helps launch outflows from luminous accretion discs @xcite , which is qualitatively consistent with our analytic results .",
