    "when a drop is held within an acoustic field , there is a force balance between the pressure exerted by the field , which tends to flatten the drop , and the surface tension of the drop , which tends to form the drop into a sphere . under stationary conditions",
    "this will result in an oblate shaped drop residing within the field .",
    "however , if the field strength is periodically modulated , an instability in the drop can occur .",
    "this will result in the formation of a wave which extends radially around the drop , orthogonal to the direction of the applied field .",
    "visually , the result appears as a star shape , with several elliptical lobes extending from the center of the drop .",
    "the number of peaks in the produced wave can be controlled by exciting the drop at various harmonics of the drop s resonance frequency .    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the liquid density , @xmath2 is the surface tension , @xmath3 is the drop radius , and @xmath4 is the harmonic of the oscillation@xcite .",
    "various methods can be used to oscillate a liquid drop and form these star drops@xcite .",
    "these methods include vibration of a non - wetting substrate , pulsating airflow , and modulating the field strength of a supporting magnetic or acoustic field .",
    "to produce the presented visualization , an ultrasonic standing wave field was created between an ultrasonic transducer and a reflector . at the nodes of this acoustic field it is possible to insert a liquid drop and levitate it.@xcite the strength of the acoustic field is highly sensitive to the amplitude and frequency of the ultrasonic wave . to provide an initial perturbation to the drop the strength of the acoustic field",
    "was modulated through the use of frequency modulation . by matching the resonance frequency , @xmath5 ,",
    "the presented star patterns were formed@xcite .",
