    "gravitational microlensing provides a useful tool for characterizing galactic objects in a way that is unbiased by their brightness .",
    "one way to characterize a lens system is to determine its physical parameters by simultaneously measuring the microlens parallax @xmath3 and einstein radius @xmath4 .",
    "the einstein ring represents the image of the lensed star ( source ) in the case of exact lens - source alignment , and its radius is commonly used as an angular scale in lensing phenomena .",
    "the einstein radius is related to the physical parameters of the lens system by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the total mass of the lens system , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the distances to the lens and source , respectively .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath3 corresponds to the relative lens - source parallax , @xmath11 , normalized to @xmath4 .",
    "however , it is generally difficult to measure either @xmath3 or @xmath4 , making it all the more unlikely to be able to measure both quantities simultaneously . as a result ,",
    "determining the physical quantities of the lens system via this method has been possible only for a small fraction of lensing events .    another way to characterize",
    "a lens is to directly detect the light from the lens system . in general ,",
    "direct lens detections are difficult because the typical separations between the lens and source at the time of the event or soon after are on the order of milli - arcseconds ( mas ) , precluding resolution of the lens from the source .",
    "nevertheless , in principle , measuring the flux of the lens and the source separately can be done without resolving the two systems .",
    "the flux of the source star can be `` de - blended '' from the combined blend flux from all unresolved objects , associated or otherwise , by fitting a microlensing model to the ground - based light curve , since only the source star is magnified during the event .",
    "a high - resolution image of the target then resolves out all unrelated stars with a high probability . finally , converting the source flux derived from the ground - based data to the photometric system of the high - resolution data , typically taken in the near - infrared ( nir ) , and subtracting it from the flux of the target measured in the high - resolution data",
    "yields a measurement of excess flux that is not due to the source star itself or to stars with angular separations from the source that are greater than the resolution of the high - resolution data . assuming this excess flux is due solely to the lens , the lens mass",
    "can then be estimated by combining the resulting mass - distance relation with a mass - luminosity relation and measuring the relative lens - source proper motion ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this `` single - epoch '' method has been used to estimate the mass of a number of the hosts of planetary microlensing events ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , there exists the possibility that some or all of the excess flux arises from companions to either the lens or the source , or even ( with much lower probability ) flux from unrelated stars that are blended with the source even in the higher - resolution images .",
    "furthermore , ground - based @xmath12band data exist for only a subset of microlensing events . for these cases , aligning the ground - based data from which the source flux is derived to the photometric system of the high - resolution data",
    "requires a large number of bright and isolated stars , which is difficult to achieve in the ground - based data due to the crowded fields and in the high - resolution image due to the small field of view . in the case",
    "that no ground - based @xmath12band data exist , the source flux derived from the ground - based light curve must be transformed from the @xmath13band optical flux measurements taken during the event to the nir flux measurements of the high - resolution data .",
    "thus , there are significant uncertainties present , whether in the alignment between the two photometric systems or the flux transformation from optical to nir .",
    "it is possible to circumvent many of the potential difficulties of the single - epoch method by simply waiting until the source and lens have separated sufficiently that they are resolved in a high - resolution image @xcite .",
    "then , under the assumption that any potential companions to the lens are sufficiently dim , the flux of the lens can be measured directly , thereby eliminating any potential contamination from unrelated stars or companions to the source as well as any need to calibrate the photometry to the ground - based light curve data . however , most microlensing events toward the galactic bulge have sufficiently small relative lens - source proper motions such that resolving the lens and source requires one to wait an inordinately long time .    in this paper",
    ", we present a catalog of lensing events toward the galactic bulge discovered over the period 2004  2013 with sufficiently high relative proper motions of @xmath14 mas yr@xmath1 to allow for resolution of the lens and source and thus a direct measurement of the lens flux within @xmath212 years , given the @xmath150.1@xmath16 resolution of ground - based adaptive optics ( ao ) systems and space telescopes .",
    "a subset of these events currently retain modest lens - source separations of @xmath220 mas and thus are unresolvable with present high - resolution systems . for these events , taking an immediate nir high - resolution image will allow for a single - epoch estimate of the lens flux . by comparing this measurement to the direct measurement obtained later with an additional high - resolution image taken when the lens and source have separated enough to be resolved",
    ", it will be possible to directly and empirically test for contamination from companions to the source or from unrelated stars and to uncover any systematic errors involved in the flux alignment or transformation .",
    "our catalog includes 20 total events with relative lens - source proper motions of @xmath0 8 mas yr@xmath1 . of these ,",
    "14 have previously published values of @xmath17 while we present the analysis for 6 new events : ogle-2004-blg-368 , moa-2005-blg-36 , ogle-2012-blg-0211 , ogle-2012-blg-0456 , moa-2012-blg-532 , and moa-2013-blg-029 .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : events ] we discuss the selection criteria for the events and describe the data for each new event . in section [ sec : analysis ] we explain the analysis procedure of the events .",
    "we then combine the results of our analysis with a thorough literature search to provide a catalog of lensing events with high relative proper motion in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "we also specifically address the current and future prospects of directly imaging the lenses in our catalog . in section [ sec :",
    "conclusions ] we present our conclusions .",
    "the relative lens - source proper motion is determined by @xmath18 . here",
    "@xmath19 represents the time for the source to cross the einstein radius .",
    "this einstein time scale is routinely measured from the analysis of an observed lensing light curve .",
    "the einstein radius is determined by @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the angular radius of the source star and @xmath22 is the angular source radius normalized to the einstein radius .",
    "both @xmath21 and @xmath22 are observable in the case of certain events , as discussed below .",
    "then , the relative proper motion is expressed in terms of these observable quantities by @xmath23    we note that the proper motion in equation ( [ eq : ppm ] ) is in the geocentric frame of reference . however , for our purposes we are interested in the ( vector ) proper motion in the heliocentric frame @xmath24 , which is related to the ( vector ) geocentric proper motion @xmath25 by @xcite , @xmath26 where @xmath11 is the relative lens - source parallax and @xmath27 is the projected earth motion at the peak of the event .",
    "this conversion thus requires a measurement of @xmath11 , which we lack for all new events presented here .",
    "regardless , the difference between the geocentric and heliocentric time scales is typically small and so likely does not significantly affect our derived results .",
    "therefore , we will heretofore just refer to the magnitude of the geocentric proper motion as @xmath17 .",
    "we establish the following criteria for the selection of our catalog :    1 .",
    "the event must display significant finite - source effects .",
    ".   there must be multiband photometric data for the event .",
    "3 .   the data must be of sufficient quality and coverage to measure @xmath19 and @xmath22 robustly .",
    "4 .   the relative proper motion must be high , specifically the value for @xmath17 must be within one sigma of 8 mas yr@xmath1 , or higher .",
    "finite - source effects are necessary to measure @xmath22 .",
    "these effects become important when different parts of a source star experience different amounts of magnification , i.e. , when there is a significant second derivative of the magnification across the surface of the source star . in the case of a single lensing mass , this corresponds to an area very near the lens .",
    "thus , prominent finite - source effects can be observed for high - magnification events in which the source passes very near to or over the lens . for a lens system composed of two masses , finite - source effects",
    "can be observed in the regions around caustics .",
    "caustics represent the locations in the plane of the source where the magnification of a point - source diverges to infinity . for a binary lens ,",
    "there exists a set of 1  3 closed caustic curves , depending on the binary separation .",
    "then , in the case of a binary lens , finite - source effects can be observed when the source approaches near or crosses a caustic .",
    "we require that there exist multiband data in order to estimate @xmath21 . for sources on the main sequence it is possible to estimate their color from their magnitude with reasonable precision .",
    "however , for sources that reside on the main sequence turnoff or the subgiant branch , such an estimate is highly uncertain . in these cases",
    "the color must be obtained by direct measurement . as most microlensing events in current surveys have sources that do not lie on the main sequence , we require multiband photometry in order to measure the color explicitly , which then allows us to estimate the de - reddened color and brightness of the source , from which @xmath21 can be inferred .",

    "figure [ fig : geometry ] contains the geometry of each event , showing the source trajectory with respect to the lens position and caustics ( in the case of the binary lenses ) . for all events we find no strong evidence for the presence of higher - order effects such as microlens parallax caused by the change of the observer s position induced by the earth s orbital motion @xcite or a change in the lens position induced by the orbital motion of the lens @xcite",
    "this is unsurprising given the relatively short time scale of most of the events , with @xmath65 days .",
    "the time scale of ogle-2012-blg-0211 is longer than those of the other events , but it is not long enough for secure detection of the parallax effect . additionally , the event is caused by a single mass and thus there is no orbital motion of the lens .",

    "in table [ tab : parms_ppm ] we present @xmath4 and @xmath17 for the events newly analyzed in this paper as well as the other events with high @xmath17 from the literature , listed together chronologically .",
    "this catalog includes 20 lensing events over the period 2004  2013 with high relative lens - source proper motion , @xmath14 mas yr@xmath1 , providing a list of events whose source and lens will be sufficiently separated in the next @xmath212 years for follow - up observations using ground - based ao systems or space telescopes that will be able to resolve each component separately .    there",
    "exist several instruments that are currently able to observe the galactic bulge and achieve the spatial resolution necessary to resolve the lens from the source for each of these events ( @xmath20.1@xmath16 ) .",
    "the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) obtains @xmath150.1@xmath16 resolution in the nir with wfc3 @xcite . additionally , imaging in the optical with _ hst _",
    "provides even greater spatial resolution ( @xmath150.04@xmath16 ) and allows for direct comparison to ogle @xmath39-band photometry . on the ground",
    "there are multiple instruments with ao systems able to obtain angular resolution at or near the diffraction limit of their respective telescopes in the nir , including naco on the 8.2 m ut4 vlt at cerro paranal in chile @xcite , altair on the 8.1 m gemini n @xcite and ircs on the 8.2 m subaru telescope @xcite , both at mauna kea in hawaii , gems on the 8.1 m gemini s at cerro pachon in chile @xcite , and nirc2 on the 10 m keck ii telescope at mauna kea in hawaii @xcite .",
    "there is also a myriad of planned next - generation space and ground - based telescopes that will be able to achieve such high angular resolution . in space",
