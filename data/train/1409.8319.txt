    "turbulent transport in the edge of magnetically confined plasmas is a key issue to be understood on the way to improved plasma confinement , and ultimately commercially viable fusion power . within the last - closed magnetic flux surface , time series of the particle density present small relative fluctuation amplitudes and gaussian amplitude statistics .",
    "the picture in the scrape - off layer ( sol ) is quite different .",
    "time series of the particle density , as obtained by single point measurements , present a relative fluctuation level of order unity .",
    "sample coefficients of skewness and excess kurtosis @xcite of these time series are non vanishing and sample histograms feature elevated tails .",
    "this implies that the deviation from normality is caused by the frequent occurrence of large amplitude events [ ] .",
    "these features of fluctuations in the scrape - off layer are attributed to the radially outwards motion of large amplitude plasma filaments , or blobs .",
    "time series of the plasma particle density obtained experimentally [ ] and by numerical simulations [ ] show that estimated coefficients of skewness and excess kurtosis [ ] increase radially outwards with distance to the last closed flux surface . at the same time one observes a parabolic relationship between these two coefficients and that the coefficient of skewness vanishes close to the last closed flux surface [ ] .",
    "recently , it was proposed to model the observed particle density time series by a shot noise process [ ] , that is , a random superposition of pulses corresponding to blob structures propagating through the scrape - off layer [ ] . describing individual pulses by an exponentially decaying waveform with exponentially distributed pulse amplitudes and waiting time between consecutive pulses leads to a gamma distribution for the particle density amplitudes [ ] . in this model ,",
    "the shape and scale parameter of the resulting gamma distribution can be expressed by the pulse duration time and average pulse waiting time .    in order to compare predictions from this stochastic model to experimental measurements , long time series",
    "are needed , as to calculate statistical averages with high accuracy . due to a finite correlation time of the fluctuations ,",
    "an increased sampling frequency may increase the number of statistically independent samples only up to a certain fraction .",
    "then , only an increase in the length of the time series may increase the number of independent samples .",
    "this poses a problem for langmuir probes , which are subject to large heat fluxes and may therefore only be dwelled in the scrape - off layer for a limited amount of time .",
    "optical diagnostics on the other hand , may observe for an extended time interval but have other drawbacks , as for example the need to inject a neutral gas into the plasma to increase the signal to noise ratio , and that the signal intensity depends sensitively on the plasma parameters [ ] .",
    "this work builds on the stochastic model presented in ref .",
    "[ ] by proposing estimators for the mean , variance , skewness and excess kurtosis of a shot noise process and deriving expressions of their mean squared error as a function of sample length , sampling frequency , pulse amplitude , and duration , and waiting time .",
    "subsequently , we generate synthetic time series of the shot noise process at hand .",
    "the mean squared error of the proposed estimators is computed of these time series and their dependence on the sampling parameters and the process parameters is discussed .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : sol_turbulence ] introduces the stochastic process that models particle density fluctuations and the correlation function of this process . in section [ sec : estimators ] we propose statistical estimators to be used for the shot - noise process and derive expressions for the mean squared error on these estimators .",

    "a stochastic process formed by superposing the realization of independent random events is commonly called a shot noise process [ ] . denoting the pulse form as @xmath0 , the amplitude as @xmath1 , and the arrival time as @xmath2 , a realization of a shot noise process with @xmath3 pulses",
    "is written as @xmath4 to model particle density time series in the scrape - off layer by a stochastic process , the salient features of experimental measurements have to be reproduced by it .",
    "analysis of experimental measurement data from tokamak plasmas , [ ] as well as numerical simulations [ ] , have revealed large amplitude bursts with an asymmetric wave form , featuring a fast rise time and a slow exponential decay .",
    "the burst duration is found to be independent of the burst amplitude and the plasma parameters in the scrape - off layer [ ] .",
    "the waveform to be used in eq .",

    "analysis of long data time series further reveals that the pulse amplitudes @xmath8 are exponentially distributed [ ] , @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the scale parameter of the exponential distribution , and @xmath11 denotes an ensemble average .",
    "the waiting times between consecutive bursts are found to be exponentially distributed [ ] .",
    "postulating uniformly distributed pulse arrival times @xmath12 on an interval length @xmath13 , @xmath14 , it follows that the total number of pulses in a fixed time interval , @xmath3 , is poisson distributed and that the waiting time between consecutive pulses , @xmath15 , is therefore also exponentially distributed [ ] .    under these assumptions",
    "it was shown that the stationary amplitude distribution of the stochastic process given by eq .",
    "is a gamma distribution [ ] , @xmath16 with the shape parameter given by the ratio of pulse duration time to the average pulse waiting time @xmath17 this ratio describes the intermittency of the shot noise process . in the limit @xmath18 , individual pulses appear isolated whereas @xmath19 describes the case of strong pulse overlap . in ref .",
