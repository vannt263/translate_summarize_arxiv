    "the _ spitzer space telescope ( sst ) _ , with its very high mid - infrared sensitivity , has revealed a new type of low - mass protostars called  very low luminosity objects ( vellos ; e.g. , young et al .",
    "2004 ) . defining the internal luminosity of a source , , to be the total luminosity of the central protostar and circumstellar disk ( if present ) ,",
    "a vello is defined to be an object embedded within a dense core that meets the criterion  @xmath3 0.1  ( di francesco et al . 2007 ) .",
    "vellos are primarily being discovered in cores previously classified as starless based on observations with the _ infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) _ and the _ infrared space observatory ( iso)_. the three most well - studied vellos to date are iram 04191 ( andr  et al . 1999 ; dunham et al .",
    "2006 ) , l1014 ( young et al . 2004",
    "; crapsi et al . 2005 ; bourke et al . 2005 ; huard et al . 2006 ) , and l1521f ( bourke et al . 2006 ) , which show very different properties in molecular line observations despite their similar internal luminosities .",
    "iram 04191 ( andr  et al . 1999 ; belloche et al . 2002 ) and l1521f ( crapsi et al . 2004 ) show evidence for infall whereas l1014 does not ( crapsi et al .",
    "iram 04191 is associated with a well - collimated outflow ( andr  et al .",
    "1999 ) ; the other two are not , although at least l1014 and possibly l1521f feature weak , compact outflows ( bourke et al . 2005 ; bourke et al .",
    "2006 ) .    the discovery of vellos with _",
    "spitzer _ has put into question the picture of low - mass star formation as a continuous process of constant mass accretion at the standard rate of @xmath4  @xmath5 ( shu , adams , & lizano 1987 ) through a single evolutionary sequence , the well - established class system progressing from class 0 to iii ( myers & lada 1993 , andr et al .",
    "this standard accretion rate predicts a much higher luminosity than observed for vellos ; vellos must feature some combination of a very low central mass and a very low accretion rate ( e.g. dunham et al .",
    "if the accretion continues at the current low rate to the very small central mass , it might not make a star .",
    "however , the accretion rate is not necessarily constant .",
    "for instance , fu orionis ( fu ori ) objects undergo outbursts ( bell et al .",
    "1995 and references therein ) .",
    "studies ( vorobyov & basu 2005 and references therein ) for the nature of the fu ori variables suggest accretion bursts from the disk to the central star by the thermal instability of the disk",
    ".    therefore , two potential explanations for the very low luminosities of vellos are 1 ) proto - brown dwarfs , and 2 ) objects in a quiescent phase of the episodic accretion process .",
    "the former can be discriminated from the latter with studies of the chemistry since they involve vastly different thermal histories , which is crucial to the chemical evolution .",
    "the thermal history is especially important in interactions between gas and ice ; ice evaporation and gas freeze - out from and onto grain surfaces , respectively , depend on the dust temperature ( lee et al .",
    "proto - brown dwarfs , with their very low masses , will never experience a hot phase , whereas the outbursts of a cycle of episodic accretion , a short time period when the majority of the mass is dumped onto the central protostar , involve significant warming of the surrounding dust .",
    "the quiescent states between outbursts feature much colder dust temperatures . as a result",
    ", envelopes of proto - brown dwarfs will be similar to starless cores in their chemical distributions , while objects in a quiescent state of episodic accretion will show different chemical distributions from starless cores or normal , embedded class 0/i objects .",
    "iram 04191 may be undergoing episodic accretion since it features a strong outflow which predicts a higher accretion rate by two orders of magnitude than inferred from the internal luminosity of the source ( andr  et al .",
    "1999 ; dunham et al . 2006 ) .",
    "furthermore , the n@xmath0h@xmath1 emission , observed with the plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) and the iram 30 m telescope , shows a hole in the center of the envelope ( belloche & andr  2004 ) .",
    "in general , n@xmath0h@xmath1 emission tends to peak towards the center of starless cores ( lee et al .",
    "2003 ) , but be deficient from the centers of class 0/i sources due to destruction by co as it evaporates ( lee et al .",
    "iram 04191 shows moderate co depletion ( crapsi et al .",
    "2004 ) ; belloche & andr  ( 2004 ) suggest that freeze - out of n@xmath0 in the high - density , inner envelope might result in the observed n@xmath0h@xmath1 hole",
    ". however , if freeze - out of n@xmath0 is significant enough to explain this hole , there should be significantly more deuteration and depletion of co than observed ( crapsi et al . 2004 ) , similar to that seen in prestellar cores ( lee et al .",
    "2003 ) .    in this study",
    ", we model the chemical evolution in the process of episodic accretion to provide a possible explanation of the chemical distributions of co and n@xmath0h@xmath1 in gas and to predict observable consequences in the co@xmath0 ice feature in vellos such as iram 04191 that show strong evidence for undergoing such a process .",
    "we use the chemo - dynamical model developed by lee et al .",
    "this model calculates the chemical evolution of a model core evolving from the prestellar stage through the embedded protostellar stages .",
    "the dynamical evolution is described by combining a sequence of bonnor - ebert spheres ( bonnor 1956 , ebert 1955 ) with the inside - out collapse model ( shu 1977 ) , where the accretion rate from the envelope onto the star+disk system is constant .",
    "the model also includes the first hydrostatic core ( fhsc ) stage , which results from the first gravitational collapse of a dense molecular core and lasts until the core temperature reaches 2000 k and the dissociation of molecular hydrogen causes the second collapse ( boss 1993 , masunaga et al .",
    "the radius of the fhsc is about 5 au , and the disk is not yet well developed at this stage . as a result",
    ", the accretion luminosity arising from accretion onto the fhsc is not significant .",
    "the evolution of the central luminosity follows that adopted by young & evans ( 2005 ) , who incorporated the evolution of an unresolved disk and stellar photosphere into the central luminosity .",
    "this luminosity is proportional to the accretion luminosity arising from envelope accretion following the inside - out collapse model ( see young & evans 2005 for details ) .    in this study",
    ", we assume that the accretion from the envelope to the disk is constant , but the accretion from the disk to the star is episodic .",
    "thus , the envelope density structure is identical to that of the inside - out collapse model , but the internal luminosity is changed by the episodic accretion process .",
    "the initial mass of the model core , with an effective sound speed of 0.27   and outer radius of 6200 au , is 1  ( equation 1 of young & evans 2005 ) .",
    "the episodic accretion is assumed to begin after the fhsc phase , which lasts for @xmath6 years .",
    "the dust temperature profile at each time step is calculated with the one dimensional continuum radiative transfer code dusty ( ivezi et al . 1999 ) , using as input the density profile from the inside - out collapse model . the input internal radiation field at each time step is calculated by the model of young & evans ( 2005 ) with their standard parameters of @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 ( see young & evans 2005 for a detailed explanation of these parameters ) combined with our prescription for episodic accretion . in this prescription ,",
    "accretion bursts 10 times more massive than normal ( @xmath10 m@xmath11 yr@xmath12 ) occur during @xmath13 years every @xmath14 years .",
    "for the @xmath15 years between the accretion burst events , the accretion from the disk to the star is decreased by a factor of 100 .",
    "vorobyov & basu ( 2005 ) have showed that @xmath16 m@xmath11 is accreted from the disk to the central source with the accretion rate of @xmath17 m@xmath11 yr@xmath12 during a burst , and the duration of the intervening quiescent accretion phase is @xmath18 years for @xmath19 m@xmath11 yr@xmath12 . according to their calculations and for the accretion rates in the burst and quiescent phases in this model , which are about an order of magnitude smaller than the rates of vorobyov & basu ( 2005 )",
    ", we adopt the timescales of @xmath13 and @xmath14 years in the two phases , respectively , and these timescales are consistent with the estimated from hl tauri by lin et al .",
    "( 1994 ) .",
    "we calculate the radiative transfer independently at each time step since the dust temperature reaches a new equilibrium essentially instantly compared to the length of our time step . for example , one silicate grain with a radius of 0.1  and a temperature of 100 k will cool down to 10 k within one second if the heating source suddenly disappears ( draine & anderson 1985 ) .",
    "following young & evans ( 2005 ) , the envelope is heated externally by the black - draine interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) ( evans et al .",
    "2001 ) attenuated by a visual extinction of 0.5 mag .",
    "also following young & evans , we used the dust model of ossenkopf & henning ( 1994 ) appropriate for thin ice mantles after @xmath20 years of coagulation at a gas density of @xmath21 @xmath22 ( oh5 dust ) .",
    "1a shows the evolution of the total internal luminosity in the model , and fig .",
    "1b shows the temperature evolution of a few infalling grid points . as seen in this figure , the temperature that an infalling gas parcel experiences peaks at the time step of each massive accretion and is lowered significantly during the quiescent states . betwen 4 and 5.5@xmath23 years ,",
    "the luminosity and temperature increase steeply with time even in the quiescent phase because of the transition from the fhsc to class 0 , which occurs from 2@xmath23 years until 5.5@xmath23 years .",
    "this transition timescale is the same as that used in lee et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , but much longer than the 100 years assumed by young & evans ( 2005 ) .",
    "the evolution of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) around @xmath24 years is presented in fig .",
    "an accretion burst occurred at @xmath25 years , after which a quiescent state continues until the next burst @xmath14 years later .",
    "the accretion luminosity powered in the burst phase at @xmath25 years is about 5 , whereas the accretion luminosities at 5.0 and 5.4 @xmath23 years are about 0.004 and 0.02 , respectively .",
    "the model sed at @xmath26 years fits well the observed sed of iram 04191 .",
    "the total luminosity in the model is about 0.09 , where the luminosity arising from heating by the isrf ( @xmath27 ) is larger than the internal luminosity ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "this result is not very consistent with that of dunham et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , who found that the internal luminosity must be greater than 0.04 .",
    "however , the density profile and isrf in their model are significantly different from ours , making it hard to directly compare the two results .",
    "the density and dust temperature profiles are shown in fig .",
    "3 at the same time steps shown for the seds in fig .",
    "the infall radius is 0.014 pc ( 2800 au ) when the accretion burst occurs at @xmath25 .",
    "the density at the infall radius is about @xmath29 @xmath22 .",
    "the density profile has the power law index of @xmath30 and 2.0 inside and outside the infall radius , respectively . except for the accretion burst phase",
    ", the dust temperature is below the co evaporation temperature ( @xmath31 k ) at almost all radii .",
    "in prestellar cores , which are very evolved starless cores , carbon - bearing molecules such as cs and co are readily frozen - out onto grain surfaces ( bergin & langer 1997 , aikawa et al .",
    "2001 , lee et al .",
    "2003 , lee et al .",
    "in contrast , nitrogen - bearing molecules such as n@xmath0h@xmath1 and nh@xmath32 are considered good tracers of ( column ) density in cold , dense cores since n@xmath0 , the parent molecule of n@xmath0h@xmath1 and nh@xmath32 , has a long formation timescale such that it becomes abundant later in the core evolution .",
    "therefore , the comparison between co and n@xmath0h@xmath1 abundances is a good indicator of the physical properties of a dense core .",
    "the low binding energy of n@xmath0 on grain surfaces has also been suggested as an explanation for the long - lived molecules in the cold regions ( lee et al .",
    "however , berg et al . ( 2005 ) showed that the binding energy of n@xmath0 on grain surfaces is not different from that of co. the high abundance of n@xmath0h@xmath1 in the cold , dense regions may be due to the replenishment of n@xmath0 through the interactions between n@xmath0h@xmath1 and grains since n@xmath0h@xmath1 recombines with electrons on the grain surfaces .",
    "the significant depletion of co and electrons , the principal destroyers of n@xmath0h@xmath1 in the gas phase , is another explanation for the high abundance of n@xmath0h@xmath1 in these cold , dense regions .",
    "we updated the chemical network used in lee et al .",
    "( 2004 ) to include recent results on the n@xmath0h@xmath1 chemistry , including a new binding energy of n@xmath0 identical to that of co ( berg et al . 2005 ) and new rates of dissociative recombination of n@xmath0h@xmath1 with electrons ( geppert et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the initial abundances of other species are the same as those in table 3 of lee et al .",
    "bare silicate grains were assumed for binding energies of molecules .",
    "4 presents the evolution of the co abundance in gas and ice at the time steps @xmath13 years before , during , and 3 and @xmath33 years after the accretion burst at @xmath25 years since the model sed at @xmath26 years fits the observations of iram 04191 reasonably well .",
    "@xmath13 years before the accretion burst , co is frozen - out onto grain surfaces and depleted from the gas at most radii except around the co evaporation radius , inside which the dust temperature is higher than the co evaporation temperature , developed by the previous accretion burst at @xmath34 years . during the burst phase , the co evaporation radius jumps to a much larger radius due to the significant increase in accretion luminosity .",
    "once the burst phase ends and the core makes the transition back to the quiescent phase , the accretion luminosity , and therefore the temperature , decreases greatly .",
    "co is then gradually frozen back out of the gas and onto the grain surfaces .",
    "the evolution of the n@xmath0h@xmath1 abundance is shown in fig .",
    "before the accretion burst at @xmath25 years , the n@xmath0h@xmath1 abundance peaks at a rather large radius and decreases inward .",
    "( the sharp drop of the n@xmath0h@xmath1 abundance at the edge of the model core results from the dissociative recombination of n@xmath0h@xmath1 with electrons . ) at radii of 0.002 pc ( log r@xmath35 ) and 0.0008 pc ( log r@xmath36 ) , the bumps of n@xmath0h@xmath1 are caused by the dips of co at these radii . the n@xmath0h@xmath1 abundance decreases at radii smaller than 0.0008 pc even though co is depleted here .",
    "n@xmath0h@xmath1 forms mainly by the reaction between n@xmath0 and h@xmath37 , which is destroyed by co. as mentioned above , the evaporation temperature of n@xmath0 is the same as that of co , i.e. , @xmath3820 k. therefore , at the radii smaller than 0.0008 pc where the dust temperature is lower than @xmath31 k , and the density is greater than @xmath21 @xmath22 , the significant freeze - out of n@xmath0 causes the low abundance of n@xmath0h@xmath1 . during the burst phase , the n@xmath0h@xmath1 abundance drops significantly at radii smaller than the co evaporation radius since co destroys n@xmath0h@xmath1 . in the quiescent states 3 , 5 , and @xmath39 years after the burst , n@xmath0h@xmath1 slowly increases at small radii as co is frozen - out onto the grain surfaces .",
    "most vellos were classified as starless core before _ spitzer _ observations , and they showed wide variation in chemical and physical properties .",
    "for instance , iram 04191 ( andr  et al . 1999 ) and l673 - 7 ( m. dunham 2007 , private communication ) have well - collimated molecular outflows , but no molecular outflow has been detected in l1521f even though its _ spitzer _",
    "irac images show a compact bipolar scattered emission nebula ( bourke et al .",
    "l1014 features a very compact outflow detected with the submillimeter array ( bourke 2005 ) . in chemical properties ,",
    "iram 04191 and l1014 are similar with moderate co depletion but different in their n@xmath0h@xmath1 emission , which peaks at the center of l1014 but shows a hole at the center of iram04191 .",
    "l1521f , which was believed to be a highly evolved starless core ( crapsi et al .",
    "2004 ) , shows significant co depletion and centrally peaked n@xmath0h@xmath1 emission . before the _ spitzer _ observations , this variation in chemical properties",
    "was believed to arise from an as - of - yet incompletely understood evolutionary sequence of starless cores .",
    "the discovery of the vellos has cast doubt on our understanding of the continuous and unique sequence of star formation consisting of the evolution of a starless core into a prestellar core followed by the formation of a class 0 object that then evolves through the class system .",
    "the sources without strong outflows might be in the final accretion phase of substellar objects or in the fhsc stage ( omukai et al .",
    "on the other hand , vellos with strong , well - collimated outflows such as iram 04191 are hard to understand since the outflow suggests a much higher accretion luminosity than the observed internal luminosity of the source .",
    "a possible explanation for such objects is episodic accretion . in this picture , vellos are objects in quiescent phases of a cycle of episodic mass accretion .",
    "the strong outflows observed can be generated during accretion bursts that occurred prior to the current quiescent phase .",
    "these two processes predict vastly different thermal histories , which can be discriminated by their different predictions for the chemical evolution of the core .",
    "observations probing these different predictions are challenging , however , since high spatial resolution is required to resolve the regions most affected by the different thermal histories .",
    "in addition , observations of ice features require high sensitivities due to the very low luminosities of the central source .    as seen in the previous section , the relation between co and n@xmath0h@xmath1 abundances in an object featuring episodic accretion is different from that of starless cores or hot corinos , where co and n@xmath0h@xmath1 have an anti - correlation . in the quiescent phase after an outburst , both co and n@xmath0h@xmath1 have not had enough time to reach chemical equilibrium . as a result",
    ", co can be less depleted and n@xmath0h@xmath1 more depleted compared to a core forming a proto - brown dwarf with a similar central luminosity to iram 04191 .",
    "co in ice can also be a discriminator since co ice features from vellos in a quiescent phase of episodic accretion will be weaker than those in proto - brown dwarfs .",
    "additionally , the co@xmath0 ice features can also be very important tracers of the thermal history of vellos .",
    "the co@xmath0 15.2 @xmath2 bending mode has been detected toward massive star forming regions ( gerakines et al .",
    "1999 ) , low mass star forming cores ( pontoppidan et al . 2007 ) and even dark molecular clouds ( knez et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the formation process of the co@xmath0 ice is controversial , but it must form on grain surfaces since the abundance of the co@xmath0 gas in dark clouds is too low ( @xmath40 , bergin et al .",
    "1995 ) to explain the observed co@xmath0 ice features .",
    "co@xmath0 ices are found both in water- and co - rich grain surfaces .",
    "therefore , the co@xmath0 ice likely forms on grain surfaces by the reactions between co frozen - out from gas and oh or o photodissociated from water or co in ice .",
    "the photodissociation of water or co on grain surfaces , especially in low mas star forming cores , can occur by the cosmic ray induced uv photons . as a result",
    ", the timescale of the formation of co@xmath0 on grain surfaces must be long ( @xmath41 years in the density of @xmath20 @xmath22 , pontoppidan et al .",
    "2007 . )",
    "the evaporation temperature of the co@xmath0 ice is about 35 k , higher and lower than the co ( 20 k ) and h@xmath0o ( 100 k ) evaporation temperatures , respectively . in outburst phases of episodic accretion ,",
    "the dust temperature can rise above the co@xmath0 evaporation temperature at some inner radii .",
    "there is also a range of radii where the dust temperature is between the co and co@xmath0 evaporation temperatures , so co@xmath0 remains on grain surfaces while co evaporates . in this range",
    ", co@xmath0 will produce the double - peaked feature indicative of pure co@xmath0 ice ( pontoppidan et al .",
    "2007 ) . in the following quiescent phase",
    ", co will be gradually frozen - out as seen above , and thus , combined with the long formation timescale of co@xmath0 , the solid co@xmath0 abundance profile developed in the outburst phase will not change greatly . as a result",
    ", we expect that objects in quiescent stages of episodic accretion will have a weaker solid co@xmath0 feature ( if co@xmath0 evaporates up to a large radius ) but a stronger pure co@xmath0 feature ( if the range of co@xmath0 evaporation is not large ) compared to substellar objects . fig .",
    "6 shows the temperature profile during an outburst with marks for the co and co@xmath0 ice mixture .",
    "however , if the vellos are proto - brown dwarfs , which never raise the dust temperature above the co and co@xmath0 evaporation temperatures in the majority of their envelopes , then the solid co@xmath0 feature will be strong as seen toward background sources without a strong pure co@xmath0 component ( knez et al .",
    "therefore , the co@xmath0 ice feature as well as the abundance distribution of co and n@xmath0h@xmath1 in gas can be good tracers of the formation processes of vellos .",

    "<S> a new type of object called  very low luminosity objects ( vellos ) \" has been discovered by the spitzer space telescope . </S>",
    "<S> vellos might be substellar objects forming by accretion . however , some vellos are associated with strong outflows , indicating the previous existence of massive accretion . the thermal history , which significantly affects the chemistry , between substellar objects with a continuous low accretion rate and objects in a quiescent phase after massive accretion ( outburst ) must be greatly different . </S>",
    "<S> in this study , the chemical evolution has been calculated in an episodic accretion model to show that co and n@xmath0h@xmath1 have a relation different from starless cores or class 0/i objects . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the co@xmath0 ice feature at 15.2 @xmath2 m will be a good tracer of the thermal process in vellos . </S>"
