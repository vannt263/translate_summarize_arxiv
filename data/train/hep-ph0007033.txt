    "an asymmetric neutrino propagation depending on the difference between the number densities of electrons and positrons was previously found in a charged medium ( @xmath141 ) @xcite@xmath6 there , the asymmetric term changes its sign when the neutrino reverses its motion .",
    "this property was suggested@xcite to be the cause of the peculiarly high velocities observed in pulsars@xmath6 in our case , however , the asymmetric term in the dispersion relation ( [ 71 ] ) does not change its sign by changing @xmath232 by @xmath236 . on the other hand , it is clear from ( [ 73 ] ) that neutrinos moving along the external magnetic field @xmath237 have index of refraction similar to the one for the free case @xmath238 , while the index of refraction for neutrinos moving perpendicularly to the direction of the magnetic field @xmath239 has a maximum departure from the free - case value .",
    "in this paper we have found the vacuum contribution ( @xmath240 @xmath9 ) of the neutrino self - energy in the strong - field regime ( @xmath241 ) .",
    "the obtained self - energy depends only on the longitudinal neutrino momentum @xmath242 .",
    "this fact is responsible of the strongly anisotropic neutrino propagation discussed in sec .",
    "iv . nevertheless , contrary to what occurs in the case with @xmath141@xcite@xmath4 the asymmetric term in the dispersion relation maintains the sign when the neutrino reverses its motion . from ( [ 66b ] )",
    "we can see that in our approximation the terms in @xmath206 depending on the charged lepton mass @xmath243 are negligible small ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "our results may find applications in the physics of neutrinos in the early universe .",
    "first of all , notice that the existence of strong magnetic fields in the early universe seems to be a very plausible idea@xcite@xmath4 since they may be required to explain the observed galactic magnetic fields , @xmath244 @xmath3 on scales of the order of @xmath245 @xmath246 @xcite@xmath6    the strength of the primordial magnetic field in the neutrino decoupling era can be estimated from the following reasoning . based on constraints derived from the successful nucleosynthesis prediction of primordial @xmath247 abundance @xcite@xmath4 as well as on the neutrino mass and oscillation limits ,",
    "an upper bound for the magnetic field produced in the early universe prior to primordial nucleosynthesis @xcite has been predicted .",
    "a formula for the upper bound at the qcd phase transition is @xcite      taking into account the cosmological constraint on the sum of stable neutrino masses @xmath249",
    "@xmath250 , the relation ( [ 74 ] ) implies that at @xmath251 @xmath252 the estimated upper limit for the primordial magnetic field is @xmath253    on the other hand , taking into account the magnetic field effect of increasing @xmath254 reaction rates in primordial nucleosynthesis , the magnetic field upper limit at the end of nucleosynthesis ( @xmath255 @xmath256 ) is @xcite      these values are in agreement with the equipartition principle that states that the magnetic energy can only be a small fraction of the universe energy density .",
    "this argument leads to the relation @xmath258 .          on the other hand , the early universe , unlike the dense stellar medium ,",
    "is almost charge symmetric ( @xmath9 ) , since the particle - antiparticle asymmetry in the universe is believed to be at the level of @xmath260 , while in stellar material is of order one .",
    "thus , to investigate neutrino propagation in cosmology , we would have to consider , in addition to the vacuum contribution , @xmath261 , of the neutrino self - energy , the @xmath9 thermal contribution , @xmath262 ,      notice that , when dealing with possible cosmological applications of our results , the vacuum neutrino self - energy calculated in sec .",
    "iii using the lll approximation of the fermion green function should be taken as a qualitative result .",
    "to understand this , we recall that a reasonable primordial magnetic field in the neutrino decoupling era would satisfy      for such fields , the effective gap between the landau levels is @xmath265 . clearly , in this case the weak - field approximation , which would correspond to a high - temperature approximation , can not be used because field and temperature are comparable . on the other hand , because the thermal energy is of the same order of the energy gap between landau levels , it is barely enough to induce the occupation of only a few of the lower landau levels .",
    "therefore , the lll approximation , even though too radical here since , strictly speaking , this is not a clear - cut strong - field case , it will provide a qualitative description of the neutrino propagation .",
    "in other words , the vacuum structure associated to the anisotropic propagation should still be present for fields @xmath266 , although the coefficient @xmath224 in eq .",
    "( [ 67 ] ) may be quantitatively different .    a more quantitative treatment of the neutrino propagation in a field @xmath267 would require numerical calculations due to the lack of a leading parameter . in this sense",
    ", the extension to spin - one charged particles of the ritus method developed in section ii can be very useful , since expression ( [ 56 ] ) is a suitable representation to be used to numerically find the coefficients @xmath268 , @xmath223 and @xmath224 of the general structure of the self - energy ( [ 67 ] ) .",
    "therefore , one can expect that the anisotropic propagation of neutrinos at zero chemical potential , found in our calculations at the lll approximation , would be reflected in the propagation of neutrinos in the early universe if primordial fields satisfying the condition ( [ 82 ] ) were present .",
    "even if the anisotropic term results small , it would account for a qualitatively new effect .",
    "if that is the case , one can envision that the anisotropy would leave a footprint in a yet to be observed relic neutrino cosmic background .",
    "if such an effect were detected , it would provide a direct experimental proof of the existence of strong magnetic fields in the early universe .",
