    "@xmath2 noise is observed in large diversity of real life and artificial systems , which behavior is usually defined by a complex interaction of many components .",
    "complexity of the system usually assumes that long - term correlations are observed .",
    "examples are processes and experimental data in condensed matter , traffic flow , quasar emissions , music , biological and medical systems , economic and financial data , human cognition and even distribution of prime numbers ( see @xcite and references herein ) .",
    "fluctuations of signals defined by time series obtained from such systems are found to be characterized by a _ power spectral density _ @xmath3 diverging at low frequencies @xmath4 like @xmath5 , here @xmath6 is some real parameter .",
    "@xmath2 ( @xmath7 ) noise is an intermediate between the white noise ( @xmath8 ) with no correlation in time and the random walk ( brownian motion ) noise ( @xmath9 ) with no correlation between increments .",
    "note that brownian motion can be obtained integrating white noise and that taking the integral of the signal increases the exponent @xmath6 by 2 while the inverse operation of differentiation decreases it by 2 .",
    "parameter @xmath6 is closely related to the hurst exponent @xmath10 .",
    "it is known that fluctuations which are fractionally homogeneous , i.e. unifractal or uniscaling , can be quantified by a single coefficient @xmath10 and a single exponent @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "possible generalization leads to multiscaling or multifractals , with the exponent h dependant on time .",
    "therefore multifractal processes are characterized by a set of scaling relations or power laws with correspondingly many exponents @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "in many cases , the intensity of some current can be represented by a sequence of random ( however , as a rule , mutually correlated ) or pseudo - periodic pulses @xmath12 . here",
    "the function @xmath13 represents the shape of the @xmath14-th pulse having an influence to the current @xmath15 in the region of transit time @xmath16 .",
    "the intensity of the current in some space cross - section may , therefore , be expressed as @xmath17    it is easy to show that the shapes of the pulses mainly influence the high frequency , @xmath18 with @xmath19 being the characteristic pulse length , power spectral density of @xmath15 while fluctuations of the pulse amplitudes result , as a rule , in the white or lorentzian but not @xmath2 noise .    therefore , we restrict our analysis to the fluctuations due to the correlations between the transit times @xmath16 and hence we can replace the function @xmath12 by the dirac delta function @xmath20 .",
    "the current ( see fig.[fig_i ] ) is then expressed as @xmath21    following this approach , instead of current @xmath15 , we further deal with _ point process _ , defined by the sequence @xmath22 .",
    "vs time @xmath23 defined by ( [ i_apibrezimas ] ) formula .",
    "such dependencies appear when registering the consecutives heart beats , cars on a highway passing through the reference point , transactions in financial markets etc.,width=472 ]    the _ power spectral density _ of the current ( [ i_apibrezimas ] ) is defined as @xmath24 where @xmath25 $ ] is assumed to be the interval of observation .    in this approach",
    "the power spectral density of the signal depends on the statistics and correlations of _ point process _",
    "( the transit times @xmath16 ) only .",
    "it is well known that sequence of random , poisson , transit times generates white ( shot ) noise , for example .",
    "in @xcite we proposed simple analytically solvable model for producing _ point process _ resulting in @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) noise .",
    "discussion on the origin and universality of @xmath2 noise was continued in @xcite .",
    "some further work , related to the applications of the theory of _ point processes _ and @xmath2 noise to econophysics , was done in @xcite .",
    "_ complex numbers _",
    "@xmath28 , along to their _ real _ predecessors @xmath29 , are widely used in nowadays mathematical modeling and scientific computing . beside others",
    ", they have important applications in theories of complex systems , fractals and signal processing : famous mandelbrot and julia fractal sets are defined in @xmath30 , spectrum ( fourier transform ) is defined as integral of complex function etc .    there are some clues that we should not stop with the computations in @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and that further generalization to _ quaternions _",
    "@xmath0 ( introduced by hamilton ) or even _ octonions _ @xmath31 ( introduced by graves ) are particulary interesting and valuable , even though the role of these _ hypercomplex _ numbers is not widely understood yet .",
    "in order to define _ hypercomplex _ algebras , one has to consider not only two algebraic operations @xmath32 and @xmath33 , but also one geometric map : @xmath34 , where @xmath35 denotes the conjugate vector of @xmath36 .",
    "the three operations are defined recursively as we define the algebras , in the following manner .",
    "let @xmath37 be the real _ hypercomplex _ algebra of dimension @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "it is constructed recursively as @xmath40 by means of the three following operations : @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes @xmath43 in @xmath44 . for @xmath45 , @xmath46",
    "is taken to be the field @xmath29 with the arithmetic operations @xmath32 and @xmath33 , the conjugacy map being the identity on @xmath29 : @xmath47 .",
    "this construction is known to algebraists as the cayley - dickson doubling process .    about computations with _ hypercomplex _ numbers , and",
    "why only _ real numbers _ , _ complex numbers _ , _ quaternions _ and _ octions _ are suitable for computations see @xcite and references herein .    explicitly multiplication in @xmath48 can be expressed as @xmath49 , with @xmath50",
    "we consider the    _ logistic map _ over _ quaternions _",
    "@xmath51 with given initial value @xmath52 , for example @xmath53 .",
    "the logistic map ( [ logistines ] ) has been extensively studied over @xmath29 ( real numbers ) and @xmath30 ( complex numbers ) . despite its great simplicity",
    "this map exhibits an extremely complex behaviour .",
    "the study of ( [ logistines ] ) on @xmath29 gives birth to the feigenbaum tree while the analysis of ( [ logistines ] ) on @xmath30 leads to the famous mandelbrot and julia fractal sets .",
    "further we deal with 2d projections of mandelbrot set in 4d quaternionic space .",
    "any two components of @xmath54 are set to zero , while the remaining two vary .",
    "for example , @xmath55 @xmath56 note that @xmath57 is just the famous mandelbrot set in @xmath30 .",
