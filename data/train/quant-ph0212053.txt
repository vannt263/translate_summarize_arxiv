    "continuity and a metric of lorentz signature are fundamental properties associated with spacetime in the framework of special and general relativity .",
    "though intuitive , the assumption of continuity is debatable because of quantum mechanical arguments .",
    "discrete models of spacetime have been investigated thus by various authors @xcite .    the modern idea",
    "that space could be discrete goes back to riemann @xcite who reflected about a natural measure of space .",
    "more recent attempts to consider spacetime as discrete either aim at resolving divergence problems in quantum field theory at a fundamental level or seek to reconcile general relativity and quantum theory to form a unified theory .    in this paper",
    "we investigate possible effects , which the hypothetical discreteness of spacetime could have on quantum theory . to this end ,",
    "feynman s path integral approach to quantum tehory @xcite provides an ideal framework since it naturally accounts for spacetime properties . for continuous spacetime , the path integral formalism has been shown to be completely equivalent to ordinary wave mechanics",
    "however , for a non - continuous spacetime one should not necessarily expect equivalent findings . to gain insight into the possible differences between quantum mechanics in the framework of common continuous spacetime and a non - continuous spacetime model",
    ", we seek solutions for the dirac equation .",
    "as has been pointed out by feynman and hibbs @xcite , the retarded propagator of the @xmath0 dimensional dirac equation @xmath1 ( with units @xmath2 ) can be obtained from a random walk model in which the particle motion is restricted to movements either forward or backward at the speed of light .",
    "we consider this model in the framework of a particular non - continuous spacetime model @xcite and demonstrate by an explicit calculation that the model yields common solutions of the dirac equation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section 2 gives a short review of relevant properties of the non - continuous minkowskain spacetime model described in @xcite . in section 3",
    "we calculate solutions of the dirac equation .",
    "section 4 summarizes and discusses the results .",
    "the two dimensional spacetime model considered here is defined by the subset @xmath3 of @xmath4 @xmath5 in the following , @xmath6 may take any value of the indicated range and are not to be considered as fixed .",
    "elements of @xmath3 correspond to spacetime points with temporal and spatial coordinates @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath3 is rational , hence countable , i.e. of cardinality @xmath8 while @xmath4 is of cardinality @xmath9 . with respect to this difference",
    "we denote @xmath3 as non - continuous .",
    "the set @xmath3 is invariant under the transformations @xmath10 the parameter @xmath11 corresponds to the velocity defined as ratio of space @xmath12 and time @xmath13 displacements measured from the origin of the coordinate system . as illustrated by the second line of ( [ phi ] ) , the transformation @xmath14 maps rational spacetime coordinates @xmath7 onto rational ones @xmath15 .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that ( i ) the elements @xmath16 map onto @xmath3 , that ( ii ) that @xmath14 with respect to matrix multiplications @xmath17 possesses group structure and that ( iii ) @xmath18 is a subgroup of the common @xmath0 dimensional lorentz group ( using natural units ) .",
    "according to these properties and the non - continuity of @xmath3 we denote @xmath3 as _ non - continuous minkowskian spacetime_. in @xcite it has been shown that in the framework of the d - space formalism @xcite the set @xmath3 corresponds to a spacetime model which is nowhere diffeomorphic to @xmath4 but possesses the key properties of the common macrophysical spacetime . in the same context @xmath3 may be considered as a massless solution of the einstein equations .",
    "note that in contrast to other discrete spacetime models ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) which intrinsically violate relativistic covariance and introduce an observationally not supported minimal length , the spacetime model considered here exhibits a generalized form of covariance .",
    "since the set @xmath3 is dense in @xmath4 , it does nt introduce a minimal length as well .",
    "the following sections are based on the spacetime model ( [ spacetime ] ) .",
    "we will consider light - cone coordinates @xmath19 in order to simplify calculations . in light - cone",
    "coordinates @xmath3 becomes @xmath20 to end this section we note that since the set @xmath3 is dense , it is possible to formulate differential equations without referring to a calculus of finite differences .",
    "in @xcite feynman and hibbs described a model for the quantum mechanical motion of a relativistic electron .",
    "solutions of the 1 + 1 dimensional dirac equation are obtained by summing over all possible particle trajectories consisting of movements either forward or backward at the speed of light . assuming natural units @xmath2",
    ", the motion of the particle corresponds to a sequence of straight path segments of slope @xmath21 in the x - t plane .",
    "the retarded propagator @xmath22 of the dirac equation is obtained from the limiting process ( e.g. @xcite ) @xmath23 @xmath24 is the number of segments with constant length @xmath25 between the start point ( which is assumed to be the origin of the coordinate system ) and the end point @xmath26 of the path .",
    "@xmath27 denotes the number of bends while @xmath28 stands for the total number of paths consisting of @xmath24 segments with @xmath27 bends .",
    "the indices @xmath29 and @xmath30 correspond to the directions forward or backward at the path s start and end points , respectively , and refer to the components of @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32 accounts for the appropriate normalization .",
    "since the early 80ies , the checkerboard model of relativistic particle motion has been subject to anew interest ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in @xcite it has been observed that paths with fixed start and end points have @xmath33 degrees of freedom , i.e. the last bend of a path is fully specified by the location of the @xmath33 preceding bends and the end point of the path .",
    "as well it has been shown that the normalization constant @xmath34 if only the @xmath33 bends enter the calculation which actually define the path of the particle .",
    "the general intuition behind this is the idea that the origin of the divergence problems of quantum field theory could be related to an over - specification of the theory . here ,",
    "the corresponding interpretation of the checkerboard model and the calculation scheme described in @xcite are adapted .    in the following",
    "we demonstrate by an explicit calculation that expression ( [ proplin ] ) when generalized to account for the key properties of @xmath3 yields solutions of the dirac equation .",
    "before starting with the calculation , some remarks about the limiting process ( [ proplin ] ) and the terminology are in place .",
    "first observe the structure of ( [ proplin ] ) .",
    "@xmath22 is defined in the limit @xmath35 where @xmath24 is the number of path segments a path has .",
    "the length of each of these path segments is @xmath25 .",
    "bends of the particle trajectory occur only at boundaries of path segments .",
    "this is equivalent to consider a particle moving on a rectangular spacetime lattice with equal spacing length ( or resolution ) @xmath36 .",
    "consider now the expression @xmath37 which is subject to the limit @xmath38 .",
    "for a given @xmath24 , it is weighted sum of the number @xmath28 of possible paths with @xmath24 segments and @xmath39 bends linking the start and the end point under consideration .",
    "the complex weight ( amplitude ) each path is contributing is @xmath40 , i.e. each bend of a path contributes @xmath41 . as has been demonstrated ( e.g. @xcite ) , taking the limit @xmath38 yields solutions of the dirac equation .",
    "when adapting feynman s checkerboard model to the discrete spacetime @xmath3 we will follow as closely as possible the scheme outlined above .",
    "two differences have to be taken into account , the first of which being a generalization .",
    "first , it is supposed that path segments can be of non - uniform length @xmath42 and that the contribution of each bend to the overall amplitude of a path is proportional to the segment length @xmath43 immediately preceding the bend .",
    "this leads to the generalized form @xmath44 of ( [ proplin ] ) .",
    "second , only particle paths on @xmath3 will be considered .",
    "these path are characterized by bends occurring at spacetime points @xmath7 satisfying @xmath45 in terms of @xmath46 , the light - cone representation of @xmath3 , this condition becomes @xmath47 where @xmath19 .",
    "points of the spacetime lattice should account for restriction ( [ condquad ] ) .",
    "we achieved this by considering quadratic spacetime lattices whose lattice points @xmath48 have , up to scaling , spacetime lightcone coordinates @xmath49 .",
    "the spacetime coordinates of lattice points of this kind naturally account for condition ( [ condquad ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows an example for a path with @xmath50 segments . with respect to the modified properties of the spacetime lattice",
    ", the model is denoted as _ quadratic",
    "_ checkerboard model .    from the definition of the quadratic spacetime lattice ( or directly from figure [ fig1 ] ) it is evident that path segments @xmath51 are of non - uniform length and are depending on the lattice location @xmath52 .",
    "we only will be interested in the length of paths segment preceding a bend and bends of a path to the right and to the left will be considered separately in the following . observing that the length of a path segment preceding a bend to the right ( left ) is uniquely specifying by the lattice coordinate @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) , the indexes @xmath55 can be dropped .",
    "then , the length of a path segment immediately following a bend can be written as @xmath56 the constant @xmath57 accounts for the scaling of the path .",
    "it depends on the end point @xmath7 and on the number of segments @xmath24 a path has . for an explicit expression of @xmath57 in terms of the number of segments to the left and right ,",
    "see equation ( [ sclng ] ) . note that @xmath57 scales not just the length of paths segment followed by a bend but the whole quadratic spacetime lattice . from this",
    "it follows immediately that for @xmath58 the spacetime lattice under consideration becomes a rectangular subset of @xmath3 .    in line with the generalization ( [ propquad ] ) of feynman s checkerboard model",
    "suppose now that each bend defining a path on @xmath3 contributes an amplitude proportional to the length of the path segment immediately preceding the bend .",
    "again , bends to the right and left are considered separately and the following notation is adopted : the index @xmath59 enumerates the segments of a path followed by a bend to the right ( left ) .",
    "@xmath60 stands for the lattice coordinate @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) of the segment and the set @xmath61 indicates the path segments , after which bends to the right ( left ) occur . for a schematic example",
    "consider figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the length @xmath62 of the path segment followed by the @xmath63 bend to the right ( left ) according to ( [ quadepsilon1 ] ) becomes @xmath64 and the corresponding contribution of the @xmath63 bend to the overall amplitude is @xmath65 the total amplitude of a path contributed by bends to the right ( left ) is given by the product @xmath66    having established this notation , we start with the evaluation of ( [ propquad ] ) . as in the linear case ( @xcite ) a path with @xmath27 bends that starts with a positive velocity ( i.e. to the right ) and ends with a negative velocity ( i.e. to the left ) consists of exactly @xmath67 bends to the left and @xmath68 bends to the right .",
    "the @xmath68 bends to the right can occur after an arbitrary path segment to the left .",
    "@xmath68 of the @xmath67 bends to the left occur in the same manner after path segments to the right while the additional bend to the left must occur after the last segment to the right .",
    "let @xmath69 denote the total number of path segments to the right @xmath70 and @xmath71 those to the left @xmath72 . in total , the path has @xmath73 segments .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath74 bends to the right @xmath75 is @xmath76 next consider the situation where the path consists of a large number of segments to the right , i.e. @xmath77 or equivalently @xmath58 .",
    "this limiting process corresponds to the spacetime lattice becoming dense . for @xmath77 , @xmath78",
    "is approximated by @xmath79 the contribution of the @xmath80 bends to the left is calculated similarly . the additional bend ( occurring after the last segment to the right ) does not enter the calculation since a path is fully determined by the @xmath33 bends to the right and left , respectively .",
    "we find @xmath81 to get the total contribution of the @xmath82 bends to the left and the @xmath83 bends to the right , expressions @xmath84 and @xmath84 are multiplied yielding @xmath85 ^ 2 } } \\label{rightleft}\\ ] ] which represents the contribution of all paths with exactly @xmath27 bends that start to the right and end to the left .",
    "finally , the summation over all possible paths that start to the right and end to the left is preformed by summing @xmath86 over the total number of bends @xmath27 .",
    "this leads to @xmath87 ^ 2 } } \\label{psimp}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 accounts for the proper scaling of the lattice .",
    "notice that for @xmath58 the scaling factor @xmath89 . defining the classical velocity of the particle @xmath90 we find @xmath91 where @xmath92 .",
    "finally @xmath75 becomes @xmath93 ^ 2 } } \\\\ & = & \\sum^{\\infty}_{k=0}(-1)^k { ( { t /{2\\gamma}})^{2k}\\over{[(k)!]^2 } } \\\\ & = & j_0(t/\\gamma ) \\label{psipm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    a similar calculation of @xmath94 leads to the same result .",
    "this can be seen from interchanging the roles of @xmath69 , @xmath71 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .    for @xmath95 ,",
    "the number of bends to the right and to the left is @xmath96 for each direction where @xmath27 is even .",
    "however , the path again is defined by @xmath97 bends to the right and @xmath98 to the left .",
    "thus , @xmath99 with @xmath100 the component @xmath95 becomes @xmath101 a similar calculation for @xmath102 leads to @xmath103 which completes the calculation .    to relate the components @xmath104 to the dirac equation ( [ diraceq ] ) consider its explicit representation with @xmath105 in this representation , @xmath106 and @xmath107 defined as @xmath108 are two common independent solutions of the dirac equation ( [ diraceq ] ) . since @xmath3 is dense in @xmath4 , the differential form of ( [ diraceq ] )",
    "does not pose a problem even though @xmath3 is non - continuous .",
    "the four components @xmath104 are closely related to the matrix elements of the retarded continuum propagator of the dirac equation ( see e.g. @xcite ) . despite this",
    "there is no full equivalence and a physical interpretation of @xmath104 in terms of propagator components is not straightforward . in the last section we will come back to this and related questions in more detail .    as a side remark note that for the applied calculation scheme it is essential to consider only those bends which actually define the path of the particle . while it is straightforward to renormalize feynman s original model if all bends are considered , this is not the case here .",
    "taking into account all bends , the normalization ` constant ' @xmath109 for the checkerboard restricted to @xmath3 turns out to not only depend on @xmath110 but also on @xmath30 , @xmath29 and the classical velocity @xmath111 .",
    "it is counter - intuitive that feynman s spacetime based path integral approach to quantum theory yields in the case of the discussed example intriguing similarities between the common continuous and the discrete spacetime model @xmath3 .",
    "the solutions @xmath31 obtained from the generalized checkerboard model and the common retarded continuum propagator of the dirac equation are of the same form .    however , despite the same functional form , the components @xmath104 are not fully equivalent to the retarded continuum propagator . reworking the outlined calculation with physical units @xmath112",
    "shows the dimensionality of @xmath104 to be @xmath113 which is different from the dimensionality @xmath114 of the retarded continuum propagator . with respect to the original checkerboard model , the difference",
    "is related to two origins : first , taking into account only @xmath33 bends means accounting for one factor @xmath115 less .",
    "second , feynman s original checkerboard model is renormalized by dividing components like e.g. ( [ psimp ] ) and ( [ psipp ] ) by @xmath116 in order to yield the retarded continuum propagator .    the dimensionality @xmath113 of @xmath104 may be seen as suggesting a picture consistent with the cardinality @xmath8 of @xmath3 . profoundly taking into account the cardinality @xmath8 ,",
    "a continuum - like propagator is inconsistent with @xmath3 .",
    "this is due to the fact that because of its cardinality there exists no measure on @xmath3 . as a consequence ,",
    "the concept of integration is not available .",
    "instead , one can expect ( infinite ) sums to play the role of integration .",
    "this suggests that the components of a discrete counterpart of the continuum propagator ( i.e. @xmath104 ) should have dimensionality @xmath113 . fully clarifying the physical meaning of @xmath104 in the framework of the discrete spacetime model @xmath3",
    "is not straightforward .",
    "one is lead into number theoretical problems that are not easy to tackle .",
    "other open questions remain .",
    "for example : to what extend does the path integral approach capture the relation between spacetime and quantum mechanics ?",
    "this question is raised not only by the present results but already by feynman s original checkerboard model .",
    "after all , according to its formulation , bends occur only at spacetime points with rational coordinates . as well",
    ", the velocity spectrum of the particle is rational . in this sense ,",
    "feynman s checkerboard model is of cardinality @xmath8 and thus discrete in the same manner as @xmath3 is . to our knowledge",
    "this is a fact that the literature has not paid attention to .",
    "in @xcite it has been shown that the solution of the dirac equation can be understood in terms of bit strings detached from any notion of spacetime .",
    "the present results seem to point into the same direction , namely , that there is ( at least in the special case of the dirac equation ) only a loose connection between spacetime properties and quantum mechanics , except probably for the signature of the metric .",
    "other open issues are related to the spacetime model @xmath3 itself .",
    "the ratio @xmath117 interpreted as classical velocity of the particle ( starting from the origin ) implies a discrete velocity spectrum @xmath118 what are the implications of the non - continuous spectrum ( [ vspect ] ) ?",
    "progress in this and other directions again is complicated by the fact that @xmath3 is of cardinality @xmath8 . finally , a question not addressed here is where the bends of a path occur , that contribute most to the overall amplitude . because of the structure of @xmath3 it is not evident that the locations are distributed as in the continuous case .    in summary",
    ", it has been shown that feynman s path integral approach restricted to the subset @xmath3 of @xmath4 recovers common solutions of the dirac equation .",
    "the particle path on @xmath3 is limited to bends at positions @xmath119 with coordinate ratios @xmath120 where @xmath121 .",
    "the bends of paths on @xmath3 thus occur at a subset of the rational space and time coordinates only .",
    "it should be noted that both the characteristics of @xmath3 and the discrete velocity spectrum ( [ vspect ] ) are invariant under the lorentz subgroup @xmath14 . in particular , bends of paths",
    "occur only at rational space and time coordinates and the velocity remains rational in all coordinate systems . in this sense",
    "the model exhibits a generalized form of lorentz invariance missing in feynman s original checkerboard model and most other lattice models of spacetime .",
    "this demonstrates that there is a discrete , two - dimensional spacetime model of cardinality @xmath8 accounting for some of the key properties of special relativity and quantum mechanical features of relativistic particle motion .",
