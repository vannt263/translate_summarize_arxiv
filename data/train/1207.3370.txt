    ", va images generated by the confocal transducer do not exhibit speckle noise .",
    "clinical applications of va will demand systems based on linear array transducers because the ultrasound beams can be electronically steered over the region to be imaged .",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] , the main conclusions of this study are outlined .",
    "the va technique employs two ultrasound beams at frequencies @xmath26 and @xmath27 to form an image of the region - of - interest . hence the primary incident pressure upon this region",
    "is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the position vector indicating the observation point , @xmath30 is the imaginary unit , @xmath31 is the time , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the complex pressure amplitudes .",
    "based on the radiation force concept , a 2d image formation model was proposed in which the system psf is the product of the incident pressure fields in the transducer focal plane  @xcite .",
    "an extension of this model to account for depth - of - field effects in the va image formation was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . according to these image formation models ,",
    "the three - dimensional psf of a va system is given by @xmath34 where the symbol * means complex conjugation .",
    "it is worthy noting that the psf of a va system as given in eq .",
    "( [ psf1 ] ) is a complex function . despite early success on explaining va as a radiation force imaging method , a recent study  @xcite has shown that the difference - frequency signal used to form va images depends on the nonlinear interaction of primary incident and scattered waves at the frequencies @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "both radiation force phenomenon and the nonlinear interaction of the waves scale quadratically with the primary pressure amplitudes .",
    "hence , the description of the difference - frequency pressure magnitude based upon the radiation force and the nonlinear interaction models are alike , but the phase information due to each phenomenon is different  @xcite .",
    "therefore , as the deconvolution of va images needs to be done with the psf ( magnitude and phase ) .",
    "thus , we can expect that the deconvolution using the psf given in eq .",
    "( [ psf1 ] ) may not be able to fully recover the visual information in va images .    to compute the psf given in eq .",
    "( [ psf1 ] ) one has to calculate the incident pressure field amplitudes @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the linear approximation for the va transducer .",
    "this has been done using the field ii simulation program  @xcite .",
    "even though the fields from field ii are linear the combination through equation 2 makes the problem inherently nonlinear .",
    "the nonlinearity of the va beamforming arises because of the interaction of the two beams , not the nonlinear propagation of the pressure from the transducer .",
    "the simulations were performed considering the transducer and operation frequencies used in the experiments to be described later .",
    "hence , a two - element spherical confocal transducer with a @xmath14{mm}$ ] diameter and focus at @xmath9{mm}$ ] was considered .",

    "the additive gaussian noise is the only source of noise present in va images due to thermal fluctuations present in the electronic devices of the va system .",
    "the noise level of va images has been assessed .",
    "thus , a white noise with @xmath44{db}$ ] signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) was chosen to be added to all simulated images here .",
    "this level was considered by visual inspection of the va simulated and actual images .    in the current arrangement of va ,",

    "among different filtering schemes to perform image deconvolution , we choose the wiener , the constrained least - squares ( clss ) , and the geometric mean ( gm ) filters  @xcite .",
    "this choice is based on the following digital image processing aspects .",
    "firstly , the chosen filters operate in the frequency domain , which is computationally less expensive than to perform the filtering in the spatial domain . secondly ,",
    "inasmuch as the va image formation is based on a spatial invariant model with additive noise as given in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , one can use inverse filter methods for deconvolution . in this scheme ,",
    "the wiener filter removes the image degradation without division by small values , which can lead to numerical overflow .",
    "however , this filter reduces the noise level by smoothing the image without sharpening the edges . on the other hand ,",
    "the cls filter reduces the image degradation and it allows the control of sharpening the edges through a regularization parameter .",
    "the cls and the wiener filters were used for the deconvolution of ultrasound images  @xcite . the gm filter combines the features of the wiener and the cls filters depending on the adjustment of two parameters .",
