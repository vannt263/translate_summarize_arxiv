    "<S> we explore gauge coupling unification and dark matter in high scale supersymmetry where the scale of supersymmetry breaking is much above the weak scale . </S>",

    "<S> the dark matter of the universe can then be explained by the neutral higgsino or the gravitino . </S>",
    "<S> high scale supersymmetry with light higgsinos requires a large higgs mixing parameter for electroweak symmetry breaking to take place . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus naturally realized in models where superparticle masses are generated at loop level while the higgs mixing parameter is induced at tree level , like in anomaly and gauge mediation of supersymmetry breaking .    </S>",
    "<S> supersymmetry ( susy ) is a theoretically well - motivated framework for extending the standard model ( sm ) , and can be realized in various ways . taken as a theoretical guiding principle to physics beyond the sm </S>",
    "<S> , naturalness suggests low energy susy spontaneously broken at a tev scale or below , for which the minimal supersymmetric sm ( mssm ) becomes compatible with gauge unification  @xcite and provides a viable candidate for cold dark matter  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the observation of the sm - like higgs boson with mass near 125 gev and non - observation of new physics signals at the lhc seem to indicate that the scale of susy breaking is around multi tev or higher </S>",
    "<S> . one may then need a different approach to the naturalness problem , like for instance the dynamical relaxation of the weak scale  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if realized at a high energy scale , susy would play only a partial role in stabilizing the weak scale against quantum corrections . </S>",
    "<S> receives two or more contributions whose relative phase is determined by the relaxion , generating the weak scale via cosmological evolution . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism would work also in high scale susy with light higgsinos because @xmath0 , on which the determinant of the higgs mass matrix depends , still varies along the relaxion direction . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 denotes the higgs mixing parameter . ] </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless it still remains attractive , in particular from the viewpoint of grand unification and dark matter .    </S>",
    "<S> in this letter we examine if susy broken much above the weak scale can account for the dark matter of the universe , and retain the unification of gauge couplings in the absence of high scale threshold corrections so that extension towards a grand unified theory ( gut ) is possible . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , gauge couplings unify as precisely as in low energy susy if the higgsinos , whose mass is not directly connected to susy breaking , are much lighter than other sparticles and the heavy higgs doublet  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> that is , if || m_susy , where @xmath2 is the higgsino mass parameter , and @xmath3 denotes the scale of susy breaking . </S>",
    "<S> the lightest sparticle is then the neutral higgsino or the gravitino , which can make up all the dark matter if produced non - thermally or from thermal scatterings of sparticles .    </S>",
    "<S> high scale susy with light higgsinos can have interesting phenomenology  @xcite , but needs to address how to achieve electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) that requires a higgs mixing parameter @xmath1 much larger than @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that a natural framework for large @xmath1 is provided by models where sparticle masses are generated at loop level while @xmath1 is induced at tree level , like in anomaly  @xcite or gauge mediation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the relation between @xmath3 and @xmath2 required for ewsb and gauge unification in the scenario where anomaly or gauge mediation is sizable , and estimate the value and scale at which the gauge couplings unify .    </S>",
    "<S> how light can the higgsinos be compared to other sparticles ? </S>",
    "<S> the most important theoretical constraint on @xmath2 comes from ewsb . in the mssm scalar potential , </S>",
    "<S> the squared - mass terms of the neutral higgs fields read & & ( m_h_u^2+||^2)|h_u^0|^2 + ( m_h_d^2+||^2 ) |h_d^0|^2 + & & - ( bh_u^0h_d^0 + h.c . ) , including susy breaking terms associated with the higgs doublet fields . </S>",
    "<S> thus ewsb occurs if |b|^2 > ( m^2_h_u + ||^2 ) ( m^2_h_d + ||^2 ) , where the involved parameters should satisfy 2 |b| & < & m^2_h_u + m^2_h_d + 2 ||^2 , for the scalar potential to be stable along the @xmath4-flat direction , @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> it is obvious that the above condition can not be satisfied if @xmath2 is much larger than @xmath3 as inferred from that it gives a supersymmetric mass to the higgs bosons . for the conventional scenario with [ ewsb-1 ] </S>",
    "<S> || ~|b| ~ ~m_susy , ewsb is triggered when renormalization group ( rg ) flow drives @xmath6 to negative or small values at low energy , which is possible as it is considerably affected by loop effects associated with the large top yukawa coupling .    </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable that ewsb is possible also for @xmath7 if the higgs mixing parameter @xmath1 has a large value around @xmath8 . to be in more detail , the minimization condition 2&= & , + m^2_z & = & - ||^2 + </S>",
    "<S> , shows that ewsb can be achieved when the higgsinos are relatively light and the higgs sector parameters have the hierarchy  @xcite , [ higgs - hierarchy ] || m_susy |b| , for moderate and large @xmath9 , while @xmath6 is negative or much smaller than @xmath10 in size as in the conventional scenario </S>",
    "<S> . here @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the @xmath13-boson mass .    </S>",
    "<S> the hierarchy between the higgs mixing parameter and sparticle masses is naturally realized in a class of susy breaking models where sparticles obtain masses at loop level , that is , for instance , models in which anomaly or gauge mediation is sizable . </S>",
    "<S> a large @xmath1 in such models has been regarded as problematic in low energy susy because it makes ewsb difficult unless @xmath2 is below 100  gev , which is in conflict with the lep bound on the chargino mass . </S>",
    "<S> the situation however changes in high scale susy .    in supergravity </S>",
    "<S> , anomaly mediation always induces sparticle masses radiatively , but the higgs mixing parameter associated with @xmath2 arises at tree - level : m^2_h_d|_am & ~ & , + b|_am & ~ & m_3/2 , where @xmath14 is the gravitino mass . hence @xmath15 is obtained in models where anomaly mediation is sizable to other mediations in size . in such a case , </S>",
    "<S> the gravitino is quite heavy as would be required to make the gravitino decay before big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) . </S>",
    "<S> note also that the higgsino is likely the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) because ewsb requires @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> another possible way to get a large higgs mixing parameter is to consider models with sizable gauge mediation where @xmath2 is dynamically generated from the superpotential term [ gm - mu ] f(x ) h_u h_d , for some function @xmath16 . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath17 is the susy breaking field that provides masses to messengers . </S>",
    "<S> one may instead consider @xmath18 in the k@xmath19hler potential . </S>",
    "<S> the sparticles then obtain masses at loop level , while the higgs mixing parameter is generated at tree level : m^2_h_d|_gm & ~ & , + b|_gm & ~ & f / m , for @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the vanishing cosmological constant puts a lower bound on the gravitino mass m_3/2 f / m , with @xmath21 being the reduced planck mass . </S>",
    "<S> the gravitino can be the lsp if the messenger scale @xmath22 is intermediate or low .    </S>",
    "<S> to summarize , there naturally arises a hierarchy between the higgs mixing parameter and the sparticle masses : |b| 8 ^ 2 m_susy . in models where anomaly or gauge mediation gives sizable contributions to sparticle masses . for large @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> , we need @xmath7 to trigger ewsb . in this class of models , therefore , the lightest ordinary supersymmetric particle would be a nearly pure higgsino , while the gravitino can be very heavy or light .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now turn to the issue of gauge coupling unification . </S>",
    "<S> the mssm leads to quantitative unification of gauge couplings for low scale susy where the sparticles are around tev . the unified gauge coupling and unification scale are approximately given by [ gut - tev ] & & 2 , + m_gut|_tev & & 210 ^ 16 gev . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a simple case in which all the sparticles and the heavy higgs doublet have a common mass . </S>",
    "<S> then , there exists a value of the common sparticle mass m_at which the three gauge couplings meet exactly at one point within the mssm . the value of @xmath23 is estimated to be m_1tev , where the dependence on @xmath9 , which arises at the two - loop level , is very mild .    to see how gauge coupling unification is affected by sparticle masses , we use one - loop rg evolution of gauge couplings in the dimensional reduction scheme under the assumption , for simplicity , that the sleptons ( squarks ) have a universal mass @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) . from the fact that gauge unification works in low scale susy </S>",
    "<S> , the unified gauge coupling is found to be & = & + ( ) + & & + _ ( ) , for @xmath26 and summing over the sparticles and heavy higgs doublet . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath27 denotes the @xmath28 function coefficient in the mssm , and @xmath29 is the contribution of the particle @xmath30 to it . using the above relations , one finds that successful unification is maintained for a sparticle spectrum satisfying [ unification - condition ] ( ) ^ ( ) ^ ( ) ^ ( ) ^ = 1 , with @xmath31  tev  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the wino and gluino mass , respectively , and @xmath34 is the heavy higgs doublet mass . </S>",
    "<S> the unification condition is sensitive to the masses of the higgsino , wino and gluino . </S>",
    "<S> but it is relatively insensitive to the masses of the heavy higgs doublet and sfermions . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> gauge unification becomes independent of the sfermion spectrum if the squarks and sleptons have a common mass , which reflects the fact that they form complete su@xmath35 multiplets . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that unification works even when the sfermions are very heavy while other sparticles are around @xmath23 as in the split susy  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is also worth noting that the inclusion of two - loop corrections leads to small shift of the scale @xmath23 , and does not change the qualitative features .    under the condition eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ unification - condition ] ) , the three gauge couplings converge to a common value [ gut - value - scale1 ] & & = + & & + + & & + , at a gut scale [ gut - value - scale2 ] m_gut & = & m_gut|_tev ( ) ^ ( ) ^   + & & ( ) ^ ( ) ^ . for higgsinos </S>",
    "<S> much lighter than other sparticles , the gut scale and the value of unified gauge coupling will get smaller . </S>",
    "<S> if the mssm is embedded in a gut , operators mediated by heavy gauge bosons around @xmath36 would induce proton decay mainly via @xmath37  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental limits on proton lifetime are evaded for ( ) ^-1 ( ) ^2 0.1 , which is combined with the relations , eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gut - value - scale1 ] ) and ( [ gut - value - scale2 ] ) , to put an upper bound on the ratio between @xmath3 and @xmath2 : 0.610 ^ 4 ( ) ^- , for a simplified case where the wino , sfermions and heavy higgs doublet have a similar mass about @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the constraint is satisfied in most of the parameter region of our interest . the gauge coupling at @xmath36 increases if there are gauge messengers , enhancing the proton decay rate  @xcite . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the upper bound on @xmath38 presented above is reduced , for instance , by a factor of about 0.6 ( 0.2 ) for @xmath39 ( 3 ) and @xmath40  gev . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath41 is the number of gauge messengers in @xmath42 of su@xmath35 , and @xmath43 is their mass . </S>",
    "<S> note that there are also model - dependent dimension - five operators leading to proton decay mainly via @xmath44 , which are induced by the exchange of colored higgs multiplets  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the lifetime is approximately proportional to @xmath45 for sfermions around @xmath3 , and it follows that high scale susy with @xmath3 above 10  tev and low @xmath9 is favored to evade the experimental bound  @xcite .    for gauginos , sfermions and the heavy higgs doublet around @xmath3 , the unification condition eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ unification - condition ] ) is reduced roughly to m_susy ( ) ^ ( ) </S>",
    "<S> ^4 m _ , where we have kept the dependence on the ratio between the wino and gluino mass as it can be important . </S>",
    "<S> the above shows that the sparticle masses @xmath3 can be larger than @xmath23 , i.e.  above tev , if the higgsinos are much lighter than other sparticles . </S>",
    "<S> the value of @xmath3 consistent with unification is further pushed up if the gluino is heavier than the wino  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us examine if gauge unification works for the higgs sector with the hierarchy of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ higgs - hierarchy ] ) . combined with gauge unification , </S>",
    "<S> the low energy gaugino masses have a distinctive and robust pattern  @xcite in many mediation schemes including anomaly , gauge , gravity mediation and mixed mediations , .|_m_susy 1 + b_a , at the one - loop level , whereas scalars have a quite model - dependent mass pattern . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath46 represents the relative importance of anomaly - mediated contributions , and it is positive in many mixed mediation models  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> negative @xmath46 is also possible but in rather involved models  @xcite . from the gaugino mass pattern , </S>",
    "<S> it follows = , where one would need || ( 1 ) , because pure anomaly mediation suffers from the tachyonic slepton problem . the gauge coupling ratio @xmath47 is equal to 3 around tev , and it decreases to 1 as energy scale increases . for other soft susy breaking parameters , one obtains = , for @xmath48 lying in the range 0 < 8 ^ 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath48 is much larger than order unity if anomaly and/or gauge mediation provide sizable masses to sparticles while generating @xmath1 at tree level . </S>",
    "<S> finally , from the minimization condition , the value of @xmath2 appropriate for ewsb reads [ ewsb - mu ] || , and it should not exceed much @xmath3 . as noticed above , the value of @xmath3 consistent with gauge unification becomes higher than tev for @xmath7 , and is further pushed up if the gluino is heavy relative to the wino .    </S>",
    "<S> l    we now perform a simple numerical discussion of the sparticle spectrum required for ewsb and gauge unification . </S>",
    "<S> the ewsb relation eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ewsb - mu ] ) is combined with the unification condition eq .  </S>",

    "<S> here we have taken into account that low @xmath9 is favored to accommodate the 125-gev higgs boson in high scale susy , for instance , @xmath9 smaller than @xmath50 for @xmath3 above a few tens tev  @xcite , and that one has @xmath51 around 100  tev . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that high scale susy can be reconciled with gauge unification when the higgsinos are much lighter than other sparticles . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , ewsb and unification are achieved for @xmath2 around a few hundred gev and @xmath52@xmath53  tev . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath54 gets larger , the required value of @xmath2 and @xmath3 increase by the same factor .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : unification ] shows rg flow of gauge couplings in the mssm . </S>",
    "<S> high scale susy with light higgsinos can lead to gauge coupling unification , where the three gauge coupling unify as precisely as in the conventional tev susy . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : region ] , the shaded region is compatible with gauge unification . </S>",
    "<S> here we have used the fact that the susy particle mass @xmath3 and the higgsino mass parameter @xmath2 are fixed according to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ msusy - mu ] ) once the ewsb and unification conditions are imposed .    </S>",
    "<S> l    finally we discuss dark matter and collider signs in high scale susy under consideration . </S>",
    "<S> the lsp , which is stable under @xmath55-parity conservation , is the higgsino or the gravitino . for @xmath7 , </S>",
    "<S> the lightest neutralino and chargino are mostly pure higgsino , and are nearly mass degenerate : m m_^+_1 - m_^0_1 = m_tree + m_loop , where the tree - level contribution is due to mixing with the bino and wino , and is positive unless the bino and wino mass have a different sign |m_tree| 30mev ( ) | 1 + 0.3 | , while the radiative mass difference comes mainly from gauge boson loops  @xcite , and is approximated by m_loop 260mev ( ) ^0.15 , for @xmath2 below about tev . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the mass difference is expected to be positive and larger than the pion mass , for which the lightest chargino dominantly decays to the lightest neutralino and the charged pion . </S>",
    "<S> the decay time of the lightest chargino is about @xmath56 for @xmath57 not close to the pion mass </S>",
    "<S> . it would thus be difficult to probe at the lhc , but @xmath58 or @xmath59 mediated by virtual @xmath13 boson may provide a visible signal in future linear colliders .    </S>",
    "<S> we first examine the gravitino lsp case , @xmath60 . in this case , the gravitino production from thermal scatterings can generate the right dark matter density . if the freeze - out temperature of the gravitino  @xcite t_f ( ) ^2 ( ) ^2 is higher than the reheating temperature @xmath61 after inflation , the gravitino relic abundance is determined by _ 3/2 h^2 & & 0.3 ( ) + & & ( ) ( ) ^2 , where the gravitino should be heavier than about @xmath62  kev to be a cold dark matter  @xcite . the reheating temperature producing </S>",
    "<S> the observed dark matter density can be higher than about @xmath63  gev as required for standard thermal leptogenesis  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one should however note that the next to lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) , which is the neutral higgsino , decays into the gravitino and ordinary particles with a width _ </S>",
    "<S> ~ , and so it occurs during or after the bbn epoch in the parameter region of our interest while producing high energetic electromagnetic and hadronic showers </S>",
    "<S> . such late - time decay of the nlsp can significantly alter the abundances of light elements , spoiling the success of bbn . a simple way to avoid </S>",
    "<S> this cosmological difficulty is to consider @xmath55-parity violation . </S>",
    "<S> one possibility is to add @xmath55-parity violating terms that violate the lepton number as well but preserve the baryon number to forbid dangerous proton decay operators  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , @xmath64 with @xmath65 larger than about @xmath66 can allow the nlsp to decay very shortly into ordinary particles while making the gravitino live long enough to make up the dark matter of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> note that one needs @xmath67 to avoid washout of baryon asymmetry before the electroweak phase transition  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us move on to the case of @xmath68 with @xmath55-parity conservation , for which the lsp is the neutral higgsino . </S>",
    "<S> the lsp thermal relic density is significant only for @xmath2 above 1  tev . for smaller @xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> the right dark matter density can be generated via non - thermal lsp production . </S>",
    "<S> here we consider a scenario where gravitinos are abundantly produced from the decay of a heavy scalar field such as inflaton , polonyi field , or string moduli . </S>",

    "<S> thus , lsps are produced below the lsp freeze - out temperature @xmath71 . </S>",

    "<S> note that the gravitino should be heavier than about 40  tev to decay before nucleosynthesis , and its mass is bounded from above , @xmath75 , because anomaly mediation is a model - independent source of sparticle masses . </S>",
    "<S> the direct detection of the higgsino dark matter would be challenging since it has only small couplings to the sm higgs boson and @xmath13 boson suppressed by @xmath76 , making both spin - dependent and independent scatterings too small to be detected by current experiments . </S>",

    "<S> we have studied gauge coupling unification and dark matter in high scale susy where sparticles have masses much higher than the weak scale as would be indicated by tensions between low energy susy and the lhc results . </S>",
    "<S> high scale susy admits gauge coupling unification as exactly as in low energy susy if the higgsinos are much lighter than those obtaining susy breaking masses . in this scenario , </S>",
