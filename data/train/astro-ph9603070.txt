    "<S> unfortunately d is destroyed inside stars , which then eject gas with h but no d. as more gas is processed and ejected , the value of d / h in the interstellar medium of our galaxy drops further below primordial . </S>",
    "<S> we look for primordial d / h in quasar absorption systems ( qas ) ( @xcite,@xcite ) , some of which sample gas at early epochs , and in intergalactic space where there are too few stars to destroy significant amounts of d.    the absorption system at @xmath0 towards qso 1009 + 2956 was from 40 qso spectra which we obtained at lick observatory because it showed a steep lyman limit break and weak metal lines , which indicate a low @xmath3-value suitable for the detection of deuterium . of the 15 qsos which met these criteria and </S>",
    "<S> were subsequently observed with the 10-m w. m. keck telescope , only 2 have yielded deuterium measurements ( @xcite ) . </S>",

    "<S> the amount of d in the red component is not well determined because it is blended with both the blue d and h components . </S>",

    "<S> we use the @xmath3-values of si , c , and h in table 1 to obtain the temperatures and @xmath10 of the two components . </S>",
    "<S> these values are consistent with a single @xmath10 for all lines , and allow us to calculate that the red component of d should have @xmath3(d  i ) @xmath13 = 15.4 which we use as a constraint on the fit because we can not measure this value from the d line . </S>",
    "<S> the widths of the h and d lines are dominated by thermal motions , so the lines are accurately fit by voigt profiles ( @xcite,@xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> a simultaneous fit to the lyman @xmath6 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 lines in the keck spectrum and the lyman continuum absorption in the lick spectrum ( figure 2 ) gives d / h = @xmath16 ( @xmath17 random photon and fitting errors ) .    </S>",
    "<S> a systematic increase in d / h comes from the chance superposition of weak h absorption at the expected position of d. to estimate this , we made noise - less model spectra with d and h lines at the redshifts given by the metal lines . </S>",
    "<S> we used the @xmath3 values and n(h  i ) from table 1 , but we vary n(d  i ) . </S>",
    "<S> for each n(d  i ) we made @xmath18 spectra , and to each of these we added random lines to simulate the forest , using the known distribution of @xmath19 , n(h  i ) and @xmath3-values for forest lines ( @xcite ) . </S>",

    "<S> less than 2% of h lines have @xmath3-values this small or smaller ( @xcite ) , so it is unlikely that this line is strongly contaminated with h. metal lines can be this narrow , although they are usually narrower with @xmath27 km s@xmath4 . </S>",

    "<S> there are no other lines within 5000 of @xmath33 which have h  i column densities @xmath34 @xmath30 , so that all of the lyman continuum absorption must be produced by gas in the @xmath0 absorption system . </S>",

    "<S> if primordial d / h were @xmath43 ( @xcite,@xcite ) then 87% of d must be destroyed in q1009@xmath442956 and 90% in q1937@xmath458118 . </S>",
    "<S> the level of destruction would be large and similar for [ c / h ] @xmath46 to @xmath47 , but small for q0014 + 8118 with [ c / h ] @xmath36 . </S>",

    "<S> the qas towards q1937 - 1009 in which we previouly measured a low d / h is extremely similar to q1009 + 2956 , except that n(h  i ) is larger , and the redshift is higher ( @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we used the lyman series lines up to 19 , and the absence of flux in the lyman continuum to constrain the n(h  i ) , and we obtained smaller errors : log d / h @xmath48 .    </S>",
    "<S> the best estimate of the primordial d / h is obtained by taking the average of our two measurements weighted by the squares of their random errors : @xmath49 where the first error is the random error on the weighted mean , and the second is the larger of the systematic errors from the continuum level uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> we do not add these systematic errors because they have a similar origin and the two measurments agree to within the random errors : prob@xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> in linear units , the mean is @xmath51    in table 2 we list all published measurements of d / h in qas . </S>",
    "<S> only the two discussed above are measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the others were initially presented as limits or possible detections , and they will all be biased to higher than true d / h because they do not include corrections for weak h at the position of d.    the qas towards q0014 + 8118 differs from our two in several ways . </S>",
    "<S> since no metal lines were detected , the velocity structure of the cloud could be determined only by median filtering of the higher - order lines in the forest ( @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the lyman-@xmath6 feature was considerably more complex : five components were required for an adequate fit ( instead of three ) , with two components within 30 of the deuterium absorption line ( @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the neutral hydrogen column density of the component where deuterium is measured , log n(h  i ) = 16.74 , is 4 and 10 times lower than the column densities in our two qas , which reduces the sensitivity to low d / h .    </S>",
    "<S> rugers & hogan reanalyzed the published spectra of q0014 + 8118 , and determined that the deuterium feature is better fit with two very narrow components separated by 21 ( @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> they claim that it is very unlikely that there are two narrow lines by chance at the expected position of d , but we are not convinced because there are no metal lines to constrain the velocities and their model is a poor fit to the data in many places ( @xcite ) . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath67he is more complex and poorly understood because it is both created and destroyed in stars . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the d mass fraction in the ism to primordial d is @xmath77 ( random , not systematic error ) . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath67he undergoes the same amount of destruction , then its primordial abundance would be 1/0.67 times that in the ism , which is an upper limit because @xmath67he is also created ( e.g. primordial d is burned in stars to make @xmath67he ) . </S>",
    "<S> low mass stars may produce @xmath67he copiously ( @xcite ) , as is suggested by its high abundance in the ejecta of planetary nebulae ( @xcite ) . </S>",

    "<S> however the observed abundance in galactic h  ii regions is 5  20 times lower than expected ( @xcite ) , for unknown reasons , perhaps because some of the @xmath67he made in low mass stars is later destroyed , or because observations are made in h  ii regions which contain the ejecta of high mass stars which destroy @xmath67he ( @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the abundance of @xmath1li in stars in the disk of our galaxy ( population i ) spans three orders of magnitude , because li is both made ( e.g. by cosmic ray spallation in the interstellar medium , and in novea and supernovae ) and destroyed , but warm metal - poor halo ( population ii ) stars have similar  plateau \" abundances of @xmath1li in their atmospheres . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements ( @xcite-@xcite ) , shown in figure 6 , are often taken as the primordial abundance , but recent data show that this is not justified . </S>",
    "<S> stars with very similar temperatures and metallicities , subgiant stars in the globular cluster m92 , and turnoff stars in the halo , have significantly different @xmath78 abundances ( @xcite ) , perhaps because of different amounts of @xmath1li depletion . </S>",
    "<S> ryan et al . </S>",
    "<S> have found that the @xmath1li abundance depends on both temperature and metallicity in ways which were not predicted and are not understood . </S>",
    "<S> if we are to obtain a primordial @xmath1li abundance we must either ( 1 ) understand why its abundance varies from star to star , and learn to make quantitative predictions of the level of depletion , or ( 2 ) make measurements in relatively unprocessed gas . </S>",
    "<S> our d / h measurements imply that @xmath1li in population ii stars has been depleted by about 0.5 dex , which may be difficult to reconcile with the near constancy of @xmath1li in the warm halo stars .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that our d / h measurements are probably the first measurements of a primordial abundance ratio of any elements , and that they give about an order of magnitude improvement in the accuracy of estimates of @xmath57 .    where are the baryons ? </S>",
    "<S> the macho collaboration recently announced detection of baryonic dark matter in the halo of our galaxy from 7 microlensing events towards the large magellanic cloud ( @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the most likely mass of the machos is 0.3 - 0.5 solar masses , from the durations of the events and the velocities implied by the model of the halo of our galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to a standard halo model mass of 1.6@xmath79 , and a large fraction of the total mass . </S>",
    "<S> if the halos in all galaxies are entirely baryonic machos , they have @xmath80 ( 90% confidence , with prefered values exceeding 0.3 for h=0.75 @xcite ) . this is more than @xmath81 , which is predicted from our two measurements , so @xmath82 ( prefered value 0.16 ) of halos are baryonic . </S>",
    "<S> the macho detections strongly imply a high @xmath83 : if halos are 50% baryonic machos then @xmath84 ( 90% confidence for h=0.75 ) , enough to account for all baryons .    </S>",
    "<S> x - ray observations reveal that baryons in the form of hot gas contribute a fraction @xmath85 of the total mass of clusters of galaxies ( @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining mass is some combination of unseen dark baryons ( e.g. machos ) and any other non - baryonic dark matter , such as massive supersymmetric particles . </S>",
    "<S> the baryon fraction in clusters is then @xmath86 . </S>",
    "<S> since galaxy clusters are the largest bound structures in the universe , their @xmath87 should provide good estimates of the cosmological value , so the total mass density of the universe is then : @xmath88 where we used @xmath83 from d / h and the inequality allows for @xmath86 ( @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> although our d / h measurements give a very high @xmath83 , it is not high enough to permit @xmath89 from matter : we have @xmath90 from @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> either the universe is open , as is now allowed by the theory of inflationary cosmology @xmath94 ( @xcite ) , or there is a cosmological constant .    </S>",
    "<S> we are forced to conclude , given the present state of primordial abundance measurements , that d / h gives the only reliable constraints on @xmath2 and @xmath83 . </S>",
