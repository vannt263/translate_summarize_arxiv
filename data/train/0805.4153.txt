    "<S> clear signs of excess dileptons above the known sources were found at the sps since long . however , </S>",
    "<S> a real clarification of these observations was only recently achieved by na60 , measuring dimuons with unprecedented precision in 158a gev in - in collisions . the excess mass spectrum in the region @xmath0@xmath11 gev is consistent with a dominant contribution from @xmath2 annihilation . </S>",
    "<S> the associated @xmath3 spectral function shows a strong broadening , but essentially no shift in mass . in the region </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0@xmath41 gev , the excess is found to be prompt , not due to enhanced charm production . </S>",
    "<S> the inverse slope parameter @xmath5 associated with the transverse momentum spectra rises with mass up to the @xmath3 , followed by a sudden decline above . while the initial rise , coupled to a hierarchy in hadron freeze - out , points to radial flow of a hadronic decay source , the decline above signals a transition to a low - flow source , presumably of partonic origin . </S>",
    "<S> the mass spectra show at low transverse momenta the steep rise towards low masses characteristic for planck - like radiation . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization of the excess referred to the collins soper frame is found to be isotropic . </S>",
    "<S> all observations are consistent with the interpretation of the excess as thermal radiation .    dileptons are particularly attractive to study the hot and dense qcd matter formed in high - energy nuclear collisions . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to hadrons , they directly probe the entire space - time evolution of the expanding system , escaping freely without final - state interactions . at low masses </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0@xmath11 gev ( lmr ) , thermal dilepton production is mediated by the broad vector meson @xmath3 ( 770 ) in the hadronic phase . due to its strong coupling to the @xmath6 channel and the short life time of only 1.3 fm / c , `` in - medium '' modifications of its mass and width close to the qcd phase boundary have since long been considered as the prime signature for _ chiral symmetry restoration _  @xcite . at intermediate masses </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0@xmath41 gev ( imr ) , it has been controversial up to today whether thermal dileptons are dominantly produced in the earlier partonic or in the hadronic phase , based here on hadronic processes other than @xmath6 annihilation . </S>",
    "<S> originally , thermal emission from the early phase was considered as a prime probe of _ deconfinement _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , it took more than a decade to master the challenges of very rare signals and enormous combinatorial backgrounds . </S>",
    "<S> the first clear signs of an excess of dileptons above the known decay sources at sps energies were obtained by ceres  @xcite for @xmath0@xmath11 gev , na38/na50  @xcite for @xmath0@xmath41 gev and by helios-3  @xcite for both mass regions ( see  @xcite for a short recent review including the preceding @xmath7 era and the theoretical milestones ) . the final status reached by ceres  @xcite and na50  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] .        </S>",
    "<S> the sole existence of an excess gave a strong boost to theory , with hundreds of publications . </S>",
    "<S> in the lmr region , @xmath6 annihilation with regeneration and strong in - medium modifications of the intermediate @xmath3 during the fireball expansion emerged as the dominant source . </S>",
    "<S> however , the data quality in terms of statistics and mass resolution remained largely insufficient for a precise assessment for the in - medium spectral properties of the @xmath3 . in the imr region , thermal sources or enhanced charm production could account for the excess equally well , but that ambiguity could not be resolved , nor could the nature of the thermal sources be clarified .    a big step forward in technology , leading to completely new standards of the data quality in this field , </S>",
    "<S> has recently been achieved by na60 , a third - generation experiment built specifically to follow up the open issues addressed above  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> initial results on mass and transverse momentum spectra of the excess dimuons have already been published  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this paper shortly reviews these results , but also reports on further aspects associated with the centrality dependence , polarization , acceptance - corrected mass spectra and absolute normalization .         </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ( left ) shows the centrality - integrated net dimuon mass spectrum for 158a gev in - in collisions in the lmr region . </S>",
    "<S> the narrow vector mesons @xmath8 and @xmath9 are completely resolved ; the mass resolution at the @xmath8 is 20 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the peripheral data can be completely described by the electromagnetic decays of neutral mesons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is not true for the more central data as plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , due to the existence of a strong excess of pairs . </S>",
    "<S> the high data quality of na60 allows to isolate this excess with _ a priori unknown characteristics _ without any fits : the cocktail of the decay sources is subtracted from the total data using _ local _ criteria , which are solely based on the mass distribution itself . the @xmath3 is not subtracted . </S>",
    "<S> the excess resulting from this difference formation is illustrated in the same figure ( see  @xcite for details and error discussion ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the common features of the excess mass spectra can be recognized in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ( right ) . </S>",
    "<S> a peaked structure is always seen , residing on a broad continuum with a yield strongly increasing with centrality ( see below ) , but remaining essentially centered around the nominal @xmath3 pole  @xcite . without any acceptance correction and @xmath10 selection , </S>",
    "<S> the data can directly be interpreted as the _ space - time averaged spectral function _ of the @xmath3 , due to a fortuitous cancellation of the mass and @xmath10 dependence of the acceptance filtering and the phase space factors associated with thermal dilepton emission  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the two main theoretical scenarios for the in - medium spectral properties of the @xmath3 , broadening  @xcite and dropping mass  @xcite , are shown for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> both have been evaluated for the same fireball evolution  @xcite , and the original normalization is kept ( in contrast to previous versions of the figure  @xcite ) . clearly , the broadening scenario gets close , while the dropping mass scenario in the version which described the ceres data reasonably well  @xcite fails for the much more precise na60 data </S>",
    "<S> . a strong reduction of in - medium vmd as proposed by the vector manifestation of chiral symmetry  @xcite would make hadron spectral functions in hot and dense matter altogether unobservable , but central aspects of this scenario are totally unclear , and quantitative predictions which could be confronted with data have not become available up to today </S>",
    "<S> .         a detailed view of the shape of the excess mass spectra is obtained by using a side window method  @xcite to determine separately the yields of the peak and the underlying continuum . </S>",
    "<S> the left panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] shows the centrality dependence of these variables : peak , underlying continuum and total yield in the mass interval 0.4@xmath1@xmath0@xmath11.0 gev , all normalized to the cocktail @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the continuum and the total show a very strong increase , starting already in the peripheral region . in the right panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , the same data of the 2@xmath11 region is plotted on a double logarithmic scale , but here the excess in a mass window above @xmath0@xmath4 1gev is also contained . </S>",
    "<S> this increases even steeper than the total low - mass yield , as is clearly borne out by the rising ratio of the two . </S>",
    "<S> the rise is about linear implying , in view of the normalization to the cocktail @xmath3 , that the absolute yield would be quadratic in @xmath12 .    </S>",
    "<S> the central na60 results in the imr region  @xcite are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the use of the @xmath13-vertex tracker allows to measure the offset between the muon tracks and the main interaction vertex and thereby to disentangle prompt and offset dimuons from @xmath14 decays . </S>",
    "<S> the left panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] shows the offset distribution to be perfectly consistent with no charm enhancement , expressed by a fraction of @xmath15 of the canonical level . </S>",
    "<S> the         observed excess is really prompt , with an enhancement over drell - yan by a factor of 2.4 . </S>",
    "<S> the excess can now be isolated in the same way as was done in the lmr region , subtracting the measured known sources , here dy and open charm , from the total data . </S>",
    "<S> the right panel of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] shows the decomposition of the total into dy , open charm and the prompt excess . </S>",
    "<S> the mass spectrum of the excess is quite similar to the shape of open charm and much steeper than dy ; this explains of course why na50 could describe the excess as enhanced open charm . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse momentum spectra are also much steeper than dy . </S>",
    "<S> the fit temperatures of the @xmath16 spectra associated with 3 mass windows are indicated on the bottom of the figure .    </S>",
    "<S> the remainder of this paper is concerned with excess data fully corrected for acceptance and pair efficiencies  @xcite . in principle </S>",
    "<S> , the correction requires a 4-dimensional grid in the space of @xmath0-@xmath10-@xmath17-@xmath18 ( where @xmath19 is the polar angle of the muons in the collins soper frame ) . to avoid large statistical errors in low - acceptance bins , </S>",
    "<S> it is performed instead in 2-dimensional @xmath0-@xmath10 space , using the measured @xmath17 and @xmath20 distributions as an input . </S>",
    "<S> the latter are , in turn ,            obtained with acceptance corrections determined in an iterative way from mc simulations matched to the data in @xmath0 and @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath17-distribution is found to have the same rapidity width as @xmath21 , @xmath22 1.5  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath18 distributions for two mass windows of the excess and the @xmath8 are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] . within errors </S>",
    "<S> , they are found to be uniform , implying the polarization of the excess dimuons to be zero , in contrast to dy and consistent with the expectations for thermal radiation from a randomized system .         </S>",
    "<S> the two major variables characterizing dileptons are @xmath0 and @xmath10 , and the existence of two rather than one variable as in case of real photons leads to much richer information . beyond ( minor ) </S>",
    "<S> contributions from the spectral function , @xmath10 encodes the key properties of the expanding fireball , temperature and transverse ( radial ) flow . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to hadrons , however , which receive the full asymptotic flow at the moment of decoupling , dileptons are continuously emitted during the evolution , sensing the space - time development of temperature and flow . </S>",
    "<S> this makes the dilepton @xmath10 spectra sensitive to the emission region , providing a powerful diagnostic tool  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig6 ] ( left ) displays the centrality - integrated invariant @xmath16 spectra , where @xmath23 , for four mass windows ; the @xmath9 is included for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> the ordinate is normalized to @xmath21 in absolute terms , using the same procedure as described in detail for the @xmath9  @xcite and relating @xmath24 at @xmath25=2.9 as measured to within 10% by the @xmath13 pixel telescope . </S>",
    "<S> apart from a peculiar rise at low @xmath16 ( @xmath10.2 gev ) for the excess spectra ( not the @xmath9 ) which only disappears for very peripheral collisions  @xcite , all spectra are pure exponentials , but with a mass - dependent slope . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig6 ] ( right ) shows a more detailed view into the @xmath3-like mass window , using the same side - window method as described in connection with fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] to determine the @xmath10 spectra separately for the @xmath3 peak and the underlying continuum . </S>",
    "<S> all spectra are purely exponential up to the cut - off at @xmath10=3 gev , without any signs of an upward bend characteristic for the onset of hard processes . </S>",
    "<S> their slopes are , however , quite different ( see below ) .         </S>",
    "<S> the inverse slope parameters @xmath5 extracted from exponential fits to the @xmath16 spectra are plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig7 ] ( left ) vs. dimuon mass  @xcite , unifying the data from the lmr and imr regions . </S>",
    "<S> the hadron data for @xmath25 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 obtained as a by - product of the cocktail subtraction are also included , as is the single value for the @xmath3-peak from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig6 ] ( right ) . interpreting the latter as the freeze - out @xmath3 without in - medium effects </S>",
    "<S> , all four hadron values together with preliminary @xmath26 data from na60 can be subjected to a simple blast - wave analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the results , plotted in a plane of freeze - out temperature @xmath27 and average expansion velocity @xmath28 , are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig7 ] ( right ) . </S>",
    "<S> dilepton and hadron data together suggest the following consistent interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> maximal flow is reached by the @xmath3 , due to its maximal coupling to pions , while all other hadrons freeze out earlier . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath5 values of the dilepton excess rise nearly linearly with mass up to the @xmath3-pole position , but stay always well below the @xmath3 line , exactly what would be expected for _ radial flow _ of an _ in - medium _ _ </S>",
    "<S> hadron - like _ source ( here @xmath29@xmath30@xmath3 ) decaying continuously into dileptons .    beyond the @xmath3 , however , the @xmath5 values of the excess show a sudden decline by about 50 mev . extrapolating the lower - mass trend to beyond the @xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> such a fast transition to a seeming low - flow situation is extremely hard to reconcile with emission sources which continue to be of dominantly hadronic origin in this region . a more natural explanation </S>",
    "<S> would then be a transition to a dominantly early _ partonic _ source with processes like @xmath31 for which flow has not yet built up  @xcite . while still controversial  @xcite , this may well represent the first direct evidence for thermal radiation of partonic origin , overcoming parton - hadron duality for the _ yield _ description in the mass domain .    </S>",
    "<S> the acceptance- and efficiency - corrected data can also be projected on the mass axis . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig8 ] shows a set of mass spectra for some selected slices in @xmath10 to illustrate the evolution from low to high @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> recent theoretical results from the three major groups working in the field are included for comparison  @xcite . at very low @xmath10 , </S>",
    "<S> a strong rise towards low masses is seen in the data , reflecting the boltzmann factor , i.e. the plank - like radiation associated with a very broad , nearly flat spectral function . </S>",
    "<S> only the hees / rapp scenario  @xcite is able to describe this part quantitatively , due to their particularly large contribution from baryonic interactions to the low - mass tail of the @xmath3 spectral function . at higher @xmath10 </S>",
    "<S> , the influence of radial flow increasingly changes the spectral shapes , and at very high @xmath10 , all spectra appear @xmath3-like . here , only the renk / ruppert results  @xcite seem to contain sufficient flow to describe the data .    </S>",
    "<S> this paper contains the most comprehensive data set on excess dileptons above the known sources which has so far become available through na60 . </S>",
    "<S> all observations can consistently be interpreted in terms of thermal radiation from the fireball in the whole mass region up to the @xmath32 . the superior data quality and </S>",
    "<S> the resulting clarity of the physics messages has yet to be matched by any other dilepton experiment in the field . </S>"
