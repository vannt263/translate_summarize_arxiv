    "stretching of a fluid element in a turbulent flow is a dynamic process that is naturally expressed in the lagrangian framework . for three - dimensional flows",
    ", this process can be visualized by considering a sphere that is distorted into a tri - axial ellipsoid as it is stretched by the flow . in continuum mechanics ,",
    "the deformation of an object is commonly described by the deformation gradient tensor @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is an initial position and @xmath2 is a final position .",
    "after a sphere is deformed into an ellipsoid , the orientations of the three principle axes of the ellipsoid are given by the eigenvectors of the left cauchy - green strain tensor @xmath3@xcite .    in studies of turbulence ,",
    "the most widely used properties of the cauchy - green strain tensor have been its eigenvalues , which specify the lengths of the principle axes and therefore the shape of the ellipsoid  @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues are directly related to the lyapunov exponents ( also known as the stretching rates ) @xcite .",
    "one application that uses the eigenvalues has been identification of lagrangian coherent structures @xcite , which provide insights into mixing and transport .    in this paper",
    ", we show that the eigenvectors of the cauchy - green strain tensor provide a lagrangian basis in which the alignment of both passive vectors and vorticity is remarkably simple .",
    "passive vectors along with thin rods and material line segments become preferentially aligned with the longest principle axis of the ellipsoid , and at long times approach perfect alignment with the eigenvector corresponding to maximum stretching .",
    "vorticity is more complex since it is an active vector that is both amplified by stretching and affected by viscosity .",
    "we find that the vortex stretching process also leads to strong alignment with the direction of maximum stretching , but that the degree of alignment saturates after 10 @xmath4 , where @xmath4 is the kolmogorov time scale .    there is an extensive literature on the alignment of both passive vectors and vorticity in turbulence . in many applications ,",
    "orientation dynamics reduce to the passive vector problem .",
    "these include the orientation of thin rods  @xcite , material line segments @xcite , and magnetic field lines in a medium with high conductivity  @xcite .",
    "@xcite provided theoretical predictions for material line and surface stretching based on the assumption of persistent straining over a short period of time .",
    "subsequently , both simulations @xcite and experiments @xcite have studied the stretching of material lines by focusing on the alignment of a material line with the eigenvectors of the eulerian strain rate tensor ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) . both of these studies used the eigenvalues of the cauchy - green tensor to determine the deformation of a material volume ; however , neither made connections between the orientation of material line and the eigenvectors of the cauchy - green strain tensor . @xcite and @xcite focused on the relative orientation of rods with respect to the vorticity vector as well as the eulerian strain rate tensor .",
    "they found that the rods align more strongly with the vorticity and identified that the stretching term in the equations of motion for both vorticity and rods is responsible for the alignment . as we explain below",
    ", the effect of the stretching term is to align both passive vectors and the vorticity vector with the largest lagrangian stretching direction .    in turbulence , @xcite conjectured that the turbulent cascade mechanism relies on the amplification of vortices by stretching , which subsequently leads to breakup of large vortices into smaller ones .",
    "most previous studies of vortex stretching have considered the alignment of vorticity @xmath7 with the eigenvectors of the eulerian strain rate tensor @xcite , which give the instantaneous stretching directions .",
    "it was found that the instantaneous vorticity tends to align with the intermediate eigenvector @xmath8 @xcite , and that the tendency for this alignment increases with increasing magnitude of the vorticity @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "this finding is often argued to be counterintuitive because the vorticity should be preferentially aligned with largest eigenvector due to conservation of angular momentum @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation for these observations is that the alignment is caused by self - induced stretching @xcite , implying that the strain field in strongly vortical regions is dominated by the vorticity itself .",
    "a similar kinematic argument is that a strong vortex tube behaves like a two - dimensional flow , with the most extensive and compressive strains lying in the equatorial plane and leaving the intermediate eigenvector to be aligned with the vortex @xcite .",
    "alternatively , @xcite approached the alignment of vorticity with the strain rate eigenvectors by decomposing the strain rate into local and nonlocal components .",
    "they showed that the vorticity tends to align with the most extensional eigenvector of the nonlocal component of the strain rate tensor even though it aligns with the intermediate eigenvector of full strain rate tensor .",
    "in addition to studies that focus on the instantaneous alignment , @xcite and @xcite have more recently provided new insight into this problem by considering the alignment between the eigenvectors of the strain rate tensor at a given time @xmath10 with the vorticity at a _ later _",
    "time @xmath11 .",
    "they found that the alignment between @xmath12 and @xmath13 grows with @xmath14 for @xmath15 . by including time in the analysis , these results begin to include dynamical information about the stretching process .",
    "to build on this insight , we consider the stretching that the vorticity has experienced in a fully lagrangian way rather than only at two time instants .",
    "the full lagrangian dynamics of the eulerian velocity gradient tensor have been extensively modeled and studied @xcite .",
    "most of those studies have focused primarily on how to model its lagrangian evolution .",
    "note , however , that the cauchy - green strain tensors that encode the lagrangian stretching are obtained by integrating the lagrangian velocity gradient over a finite time interval .",
    "thus , lagrangian stretching and the lagrangian velocity gradient are distinct ( though related ) concepts .",
    "@xcite analytically obtained the lagrangian stretching from the restricted euler model , and found good agreement with results from a direct numerical simulation of the navier ",
    "stokes equations .",
    "but the alignment statistics of the lagrangian stretching with the vorticity or any other vectors have not been considered .    in this paper , we demonstrate that once the stretching has been appropriately defined in a fully lagrangian way , the geometric properties of vortex stretching and the orientation dynamics of anisotropic particles become simple and intuitive .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  [ sec : method ] , we give a brief discussion of the definition of lagrangian stretching and numerical method we use to determine lagrangian stretching . in ",
    "[ sec : results ] , we present results on the alignment of rods and vorticity with the lagrangian stretching , and compare them with other definitions of stretching . in  [ sec : rods ] , we discuss the dynamics of rod orientation in detail .",
    "we also derive analytical bounds for the alignment , and compare our predictions with our numerical results .",
    "the lagrangian stretching of vortices with different magnitudes is explored in detail in  [ sec : vortex ] , where we also discuss the correlation between the magnitudes of vorticity and stretching .",
    "in this paper , we study the lagrangian stretching as defined by the cauchy - green strain tensor by analyzing data from a direct numerical simulation ( dns ) of homogeneous isotropic turbulence  @xcite .",
    "the data were generated from a simulation with @xmath16 collocation points , corresponding to a taylor - microscale reynolds number of @xmath17 .",
    "a total of @xmath18 lagrangian trajectories were followed for @xmath19 large - eddy turnover times , and the velocity gradient tensor at the tracer positions was stored .",
    "the orientations of rod - shaped lagrangian tracers with an aspect ratio of @xmath20 were obtained by integrating jeffery s equation @xcite along each trajectory @xcite .",
    "this choice of aspect ratio is arbitrary ; we find , however , that the orientation dynamics for rods with aspect ratio larger than about 10 are insensitive to the aspect ratio , as they behave essentially as material - line segments .    for completeness",
    ", we briefly discuss here the cauchy - green strain tensors , their eigenvectors , and how we compute them .",
    "more details can be found in continuum - mechanics textbooks @xcite .",
    "consider an infinitesimal spherical fluid element at some time @xmath10 .",
    "after a time @xmath14 , it will in general have been stretched into an ellipsoid .",
    "the position of any point @xmath1 inside the spherical element at @xmath10 will be mapped to a position @xmath2 inside the ellipsoid at @xmath11 .",
    "we can define a deformation gradient tensor that characterizes the deformation experienced by the fluid element as @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath21 evolves as @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the instantaneous velocity gradient , with the initial condition @xmath24 .",
    "we obtain @xmath25 from the dns data by integrating over @xmath14 using a fourth - order runge - kutta scheme .",
    "any ( affine ) deformation can be expressed as pure stretching followed by a rotation or as a rotation followed by pure stretching .",
    "thus , the deformation gradient tensor can be decomposed as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is an orthogonal rotation tensor and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are , respectively , the right and left stretch tensors .",
    "the stretching , without any contribution from rotation , can be obtained from the two symmetric inner products of @xmath30 with itself : @xmath31 @xmath32 and @xmath33 are , respectively , the left and right cauchy - green strain tensors .",
    "these two tensors have the same eigenvalues @xmath34 ( i=1,2,3 ) , but different eigenvectors @xmath35 ( left ) and @xmath36 ( right )",
    ". the largest eigenvalue , @xmath37 , indicates extension , the smallest eigenvalue , @xmath38 , indicates contraction , and the intermediate eigenvalue can indicate either extension or contraction .",
    "the physical meaning of the eigenvectors of the two cauchy - green strain tensors can be shown in a few simple steps .",
    "consider a material line segment that is _ initially _ aligned with largest right eigenvector , @xmath39 .",
    "after some @xmath14 , the material line will be deformed into @xmath40 . multiplying both sides of the equation with @xmath41 , we have @xmath42= { \\bf{f f^t f } } \\hat{\\bf{e}}_{r1}= { \\bf{f c}^{(r ) } } { \\hat{\\bf{e}}}_{r1}= { \\bf{f } } \\lambda_1 \\hat{\\bf{e}}_{r1}=\\lambda_1 { \\bf l}(t).\\ ] ] thus , the _ final _ direction of the material line , @xmath43 , is the eigenvector of the left cauchy - green strain tensor that corresponds to the maximum eigenvalue ",
    "namely @xmath44 .",
    "the same proof applies for the other two pairs of eigenvectors ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) .",
    "material lines that initially align with an eigenvector of the right tensor end up aligned with the counterpart eigenvector of the left tensor .",
    "hereafter , to capture their physical meaning , the @xmath49 and @xmath44 are also referred to as the initial and final largest lagrangian stretching directions , respectively . similarly , @xmath50 at time @xmath10 and @xmath51 are referred to as the initial and final largest eulerian stretching directions .",
    "@xmath52{alignment_threefigv6.eps } \\end{array}$ ]    figure [ fig : omgcg ] shows the alignment of infinitesimal rods @xmath53 and the vorticity @xmath54 with both the lagrangian and eulerian stretching directions .",
    "the alignment is quantified using the square of the cosine of the angles between two unit vectors .",
    "both rods and vorticity align most strongly with the final largest lagrangian stretching direction , @xmath44 , especially if we use time intervals of at least @xmath55 to calculate @xmath44 . in fig .  [",
    "fig : omgcg](a ) , the degree of alignment of rods with @xmath44 is higher than it is for the vorticity because infinitesimal rods are material line segments that passively align with @xmath44 .",
    "the evolution of vorticity , on the other hand , is more complicated . from its equation of motion",
    ", the vorticity evolves both due to stretching by the velocity gradient tensor and to the tearing or reconnection at small scales that can be induced by viscosity .",
    "the stretching of vorticity is the same as the stretching of a material line segment , and will tend to align the vorticity in the same direction as @xmath44 . indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig : omgcg](a ) shows that the alignment between @xmath54 and @xmath44 is very strong , but that this alignment reaches a plateau at 0.6 after 10 @xmath4 .",
    "we interpret this plateau as a result of the dynamic balance between stretching , which moves @xmath54 toward @xmath44 , and viscous effects , which move them apart .",
    "for the same reason , @xmath56 can not be perfectly perpendicular to @xmath48 and @xmath46 , as also seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : omgcg](a ) .",
    "we remark that , since both rods and vorticity independently show strong alignment with @xmath44 due to the stretching process , they must also align with each other  @xcite .    at @xmath57 ,",
    "[ fig : omgcg ] tells us that the instantaneous alignment between rods ( @xmath58 ) and the eigenvectors of the eulerian strain - rate tensor @xmath59 are 0.40 , 0.44 , and 0.16 for @xmath60 .",
    "these values indicate that rods are slightly more aligned with @xmath61 than @xmath50 , consistent with some previous work @xcite .",
    "however , other studies have reported different results .",
    "experimentally , @xcite and @xcite found that material lines with random initial orientations align preferentially with @xmath62 after @xmath63 .",
    "@xcite studied the alignment of material lines at six different reynolds numbers , ranging from @xmath64 to 430 .",
    "he found that at short times ( @xmath65 ) , material lines were preferentially oriented along @xmath62 , a finding consistent with the experimental results @xcite .",
    "but in the long - time limit ( @xmath66 ) , the alignment of material lines was very sensitive to the reynolds number . at @xmath67 and 430 , material lines aligned more with @xmath62 , while at intermediate reynolds numbers ( @xmath68 , 73 , 120 and 240 ) , material lines aligned better with @xmath8 . in all of these cases , however , the observed alignment of material lines with any of the @xmath5 was much weaker than the alignment we observe with the lagrangian stretching direction .    as time evolves , the alignment between the vorticity , @xmath56 , and the eigenvectors of the left cauchy - green tensor @xmath35 changes from 0.32 , 0.52 , and 0.16 at @xmath69 for @xmath60 , eventually saturating at 0.61 , 0.33 , and 0.06 at @xmath70 .",
    "this evolution indicates that if we define stretching in a lagrangian way rather than an eulerian one , the vorticity aligns with the largest stretching direction rather than the intermediate eigenvector .",
    "numerous studies have proposed explanations for the puzzling alignment between vorticity and the intermediate eigenvector of the eulerian strain rate @xcite ; in a fully lagrangian description , however , the alignment is much simpler .",
    "the vorticity becomes preferentially aligned with the largest stretching direction due to angular momentum conservation , just as one would intuitively expect .",
    "the alignment trends between both rods and the vorticity and @xmath49 and @xmath71 are very similar to each other , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : omgcg](b ) and ( c ) . to explain this similarity , we recall first that @xmath49 gives the direction in which an initial spherical fluid element will be most strongly stretched after @xmath14 .",
    "similarly , @xmath71 is the direction of strongest stretching at the initial time @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "thus , the alignment of @xmath54 and @xmath53 with either @xmath49 or @xmath72 arises from the same dynamical picture . in each case ,",
    "alignment with the initially strongest stretching direction builds up over a short but finite time . but as @xmath14 grows , the direction of strongest stretching at the initial time becomes more and more uncorrelated with the final orientation of the rods or vorticity .",

    "subsequently , over a much longer time scale , they become parallel to @xmath44 and perpendicular to @xmath46 . to understand this slow alignment",
