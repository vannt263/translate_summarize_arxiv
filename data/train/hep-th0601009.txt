    "the leading contribution to the free energy , @xmath19 , is basically the coulomb energy of the charged fluid in the domain @xmath18 . taking into account the discrete  atomic \" structure of the dyson gas , which implies a short - distance cutoff and entropy of macroscopic states ,",
    "one is able to find the correction @xmath20 to the `` classical '' free energy .",

    "our results for @xmath21 ( partially reported in @xcite ) enjoy a similar interpretation and lead to interesting connections with spectral geometry of planar domains .",

    "our results for @xmath21 suggest a new deep connection between the 2d dyson gas and 2d quantum gravity .",

    "more generally , the connected part of the @xmath31-point density correlation function is given by the linear response of the @xmath32-point one to a small variation of the potential .",
    "let @xmath33 be a function in the complex plane ( for brevity we write simply @xmath34 in what follows ) .",
