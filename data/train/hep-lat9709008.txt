    "in this conference contribution , we summarize recent efforts  @xcite to determine various critical quantities of the 3d ising universality class using the monte carlo ( mc ) method .",
    "these efforts are worthwhile for at least three reasons : 1 ) there are many systems in nature belonging to the ising universality class .",
    "thus a comparison of theoretical predictions with experimental results is possible .",
    "2 ) getting precise estimates is still a challenge , both from the algorithmic side and from a theoretical point of view .",
    "mc data with increasing statistical precision put standard assumptions to test and may require more and more refined theoretical modelling .",
    "3 ) mc precision has now become competitive with , e.g. , high / low temperature series expansions , the @xmath8-expansion and 3d field theoretic calculations . comparing the results",
    "is interesting and might point out sources of systematic errors in either method .",
    "properties of interfaces separating extended domains of different phases are of great interest , both from the experimental and the theoretical point of view . for recent experimental work measuring observables that are related to and",
    "can be compared with quantities studied in the present work , see @xcite .",
    "figure 1 + lattice geometry       we consider the 3d ising model on a cubic lattice of size @xmath9 with spins @xmath10 , hamiltonian @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes a pair of nearest neighbour sites on the lattice , and partition function @xmath13 $ ] . by @xmath14",
    "we denote the partition function with periodic boundary conditions in all three directions .",
    "antiperiodic boundary conditions in @xmath15-direction favour the occurence of interfaces ( perpendicular to the @xmath15-axis ) , see figure  1 .",
    "the corresponding partition function is denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "if we can assume that there is exactly one interface in the system , its free energy is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 takes care of the free motion of the interface in the @xmath15-direction .",
    "we obtained the interface free energies by integration of the interface energy @xmath19 : @xmath20 various state of the art algorithms were employed : the boundary flip cluster algorithm for the determination of @xmath21 , the wolff single cluster , the ising interface cluster and the multispin coded demon algorithm for the determination of @xmath22 .",
    "detailed descriptions and the appropriate references can be found in  @xcite .",
    "interface tensions @xmath23 were then obtained by fitting the free energies with either @xmath24 or  @xcite @xmath25 we chose lattice sizes @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "data were taken on a dense grid of @xmath30 values in the range @xmath31 . in table",
    "[ tab1 ] we quote a few of our fit results for the interface tension .    ",
    ".selection of @xmath23 estimates [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     again we used two definitions of @xmath15 , namely @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "there is a slight mismatch of the estimate for @xmath34 with the estimates from the critical data in table  [ tab3 ] .",
    "it is most likely due to corrections to scaling that have not been taken into account .",
    "we finally estimated the universal constant @xmath35 on both sides of the transition .",
    "estimates for @xmath7 were obtained by integration over @xmath30 of the singular part of the energy , obtained from the approximation @xmath36 . using our background estimates @xmath34 and @xmath37 together with the correlation lengths given in  @xcite",
    ", we obtained @xmath38 for @xmath39 , and @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "for various interface and bulk quantities we could significantly improve on older numerical estimates .",
    "especially interesting is the quite precise determination of @xmath5 from the finite size scaling of the energy and specific heat at criticality .",
