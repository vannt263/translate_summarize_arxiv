    "frustrated quantum magnetism in low dimensions has received considerable attention in recent decades . the exotic magnetic behavior arises from frustrated geometry , such as triangular lattices and kagme lattices , which usually offer a large degeneracy in the thermodynamic limt@xcite . in quantum limit",
    ", this is relevant to the quantum spin liquids .",
    "recently , zncu@xmath1(od)@xmath2cl@xmath3 , also called herbertsmithite , was experimentally identified as a promising spin liquids and is modeled as the spin-1/2 kagme - lattice antiferromagnet@xcite .",
    "another indication for frustrated magnetism is in the spin-@xmath4 antiferromagnetic ( af ) heisenberg model on a two - dimensional square lattice . without frustration ,",
    "the ground state is the nel ordering@xcite and the model provides a description of the parents of la@xmath3cuo@xmath5@xcite . with next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn )",
    "af exchange , however , the other magnetic collinear state will be triggered to compete with the nel state .",
    "as the nnn exchange is at the same order of the nearest - neighbor ( nn ) one , the ground state is magnetically disordered@xcite , and recently has been identified to have a character of the spin liquids state@xcite",
    ". the liquid state may be relevant to high - temperature superconductors@xcite .",
    "the exotic state is however difficult to be determined without any unambiguity .",
    "theoretically the many - body effect prevents us against directly studying it , and numerically the frustrated spin systems suffer the minus sign problems , so the quantum monte carlo is unable to accurately capture the behavior .",
    "the spin ladder instead provides another route to study the physics since a ladder plays a role crossover from one dimensions and two dimensions@xcite .",
    "the frustrated two - leg spin ladders have been intensively investigated during the decade@xcite . without frustrated nnn af exchange",
    ", the ground state is singlet with a finite spin gap@xcite . in the large nnn af couplings",
    "limit , the ladder topologically behaves as a spin-1 chain@xcite .",
    "in addition , it has been argued that there exists an intermediate state , the columnar dimer state , in the moderate frustration regime@xcite .",
    "this indicates that even in a two - leg ladder frustrated magnetism can provide rich phase diagrams .",
    "recently , the one - dimensional heisenberg model with ferromagnetic ( fm ) nn interaction with af nnn exchange ( represented as the zigzag ladder ) has also been frequently mentioned@xcite since experimentally the corresponding materials are discovered , including the edge - sharing cuo@xmath6 chains nacu@xmath3o@xmath3@xcite , quasi - one dimensional helimagnet licuvo@xmath5@xcite , and powder cuprate rb@xmath3cu@xmath3mo@xmath1o@xmath7@xcite etc . in the frustrated fm chain , an exotic phase with short - range incommensurate spin - spin correlations is discovered by following the fm phase with moderate frustration theoretically@xcite . on the other hand , in analogy to the zigzag ladder , the fm - leg and af - rung ladder , also indicates unconventional quantum magnetism behavior@xcite and experimentally the corresponding compound is also discovered@xcite .",
    "next it is natural to consider a frustrated fm ladder , where both of legs and rungs are fm , but diagonal exchange is af . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "such the frustrated fm ladder has not drawn too much attention .",
    "therefore , we may ask whether or not there exists a novel ground state phase diagram in the system .",
    "even further , one is wondering how much difference once the spin ladders are equipped with inequivalent legs ( asymmetric ladders ) .",
    "the leg asymmetry may generate possible new phases and may induce different behaviors of the excitation spectra in the limiting cases of weak and strong asymmetries@xcite .",
    "the fascinating models with geometric leg - asymmetry include the sawtooth strip lattice@xcite , comb - like ( necklace - like ) model@xcite and the diamond - chain@xcite . therefore , theoretically it is attractive to investigate the frustrated asymmetric fm ladders , in particular , for highly asymmetric fm coupling in the legs and with moderate af diagonal frustration .",
    "the aim of this paper is to systematically study the quantum phase transition ( qpt ) in the frustrated asymmetric fm spin ladder .",
    "there are four ground state phases in the system : fm , partially polarized canted , spin - stripe and singlet ( @xmath8 ) dimerized states . at weak asymmetry ,",
    "increasing nnn af coupling can induce a first - order transition from the fm state to the spin - stripe state or to the dimerized state . at strong asymmetry ,",
    "however , the processes between the fm state to the canted state and between the canted state to the spin - stripe state are second - order .",
    "the singlet dimerized state is characteristic of the @xmath8 state with dimerization in the strong frustration regions .",
    "it is associated with the of two neighboring sites spin correlations with alternating strengths .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sect : hamiltonian ] , we introduce the model hamiltonian of the two - leg frustrated asymmetric fm ladder",
    ". then we present a classical analysis for the comb - like model which is in the highly asymmetric limit in sec .",
    "[ sect : comblikemodel ] . in sec .",
    "[ sect : results ] , we firstly present the ground state phase diagram , then we introduce the physical measurements used to distinguish the qpt using the lanczs diagonalization and the density matrix renomalization groups ( dmrg ) method",
    "[ sect : summary ] is the summary .",
    "in this paper , we study the ground state phase diagram of the two - leg frustrated nn fm spin ladder with asymmetric legs , shown in figure [ fig : fig1 ] .",
    "the model hamiltonian reads as , @xmath9 where @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) denotes a spin-@xmath4 operator of site-@xmath12 on the top ( bottom ) leg , and @xmath13 is the length of the ladder . @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the intraleg couplings on the top and bottom leg , respectively ; @xmath16 denotes the interleg coupling on the rungs . @xmath17 and @xmath16 are all negative , representing the nn fm exchange couplings . as @xmath18 , the first three terms of equation ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) forms a fm spin ladder .    here",
    ", we shall consider a more generic case , the asymmetric ladder : @xmath19 .",
    "in addition , we introduce the diagonal af exchange coupling @xmath20 between the legs .",
    "the existence of @xmath21 leads spins to align anti - parallel and competes with the @xmath17 , so it brings frustration . for convenience ,",
    "we hereafter set @xmath22 , indicated as the bold black lines in figure [ fig : fig1 ] . the ratios @xmath23 and @xmath24 are defined to describe the asymmetric strength and the frustration strength , respectively .",
    "the asymmetric ladder in the @xmath25 limit ( @xmath26 ) reduces to the comb - like model@xcite .",
    "it is well known that if there is no af frustration , @xmath27 , the ground state is a fully polarized fm state , where all spins align in one direction , as shown in figure [ fig : fig2](a ) .",
    "the totals spin is @xmath28 , where @xmath29 . on the other hand , in the large @xmath21 limit , the spins connected by the diagonal af bonds are anti - parallel aligned , and the ground state is singlet but has spin - stripe , i.e. spin aligns parallel only along the leg direction , shown in figure [ fig : fig2](b ) .",
    "therefore there exists a qpt with increasing @xmath21 ( the frustration strength @xmath30 ) and the boundary location may be dependent on the value of @xmath31 .",
    "we perform numerical simulation to study the ground state phase diagram in @xmath32 plane .",
    "in addition to the fm and spin - stripe states , there exists a magnetic canted phase and a singlet dimerized state at strong asymmetry ( as @xmath31 is small ) . in the canted state ,",
    "the spin orientations are non - collinear , and those of the same leg orient @xmath33 and @xmath34 alternatively [ cf .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2](c ) ] .",
    "similar to the _ ferrimagnetism _ of mixed spin systems@xcite , magnetically it is a partially polarized ordering state , and the total spin is less than @xmath35 . on the other hand",
    ", the singlet dimerized state shows a lone - ranged character of dimerization in spin - spin correlations . in the following",
    "we will argue the presence of the canted state and pin out the onset in the frustrated spin ladder with strong asymmetry classically .",
    "before further studying the quantum ground states of hamiltonian equation ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) , we examine the classical ground states in the highly asymmetric limited ( @xmath25 ) , i.e. the comb - like case . in the classical version , each spin is considered as a three - dimensional vector . by considering generic spin patterns , however , we find that the actual ground states can be always equivalent to a symmetric pattern which is shown in figure [ fig : fig2](c ) .",
    "@xmath36 is used to describe the angle that spins @xmath37 and @xmath38 deviate from the @xmath39 axis , respectively . under the periodic boundary conditions , we can only consider four interaction terms : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 to analyze the ground state .",
    "the hamiltonian can be denoted in the following form @xmath44 the necessary conditions to minimize the energy are @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the solution is @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , as well as with the relation @xmath50 and @xmath51 , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are arbitrary integer numbers .",
    "the effective angular separation between any two fm correlated spins is @xmath54 . in the classical canted states ,",
    "the @xmath55 value is in the interval @xmath56 .",
    "it can be deduced that when @xmath57 , the above canted state solution is the ground states and its ground state energy is @xmath58 .",
    "this is always lower than @xmath59 for the collinear diagonal - af - correlated state solutions , i.e. , collinear spin - stripe phase or the collinear haldane phase . in the limit of @xmath60 , these three states are degenerate .    in general ,",
    "there are two magnetic phases in the classical comb - like model .",
    "when @xmath61 , the ground state is pure fm state .",
    "when @xmath57 , the ground state is the canted states . at an arbitrary value of @xmath31",
    ", the degeneracy between the spin - stripe state and the haldane state is lifted , and the spin - stripe state has lower energy than the haldane state .",
    "in this section we will present the numerical results for the frustrated asymmetric ladder for @xmath62 .",
    "we perform the lanczs diagonalization @xcite and the dmrg methods@xcite to study the ground state property .",
    "in contrast to the lanczs method , the dmrg is performed with a truncated hilbert space where the truncated basis is filtered by reduced density matrices successively . here",
    "the number of states is kept as @xmath63 .",
    "we denote @xmath13 as the ladder length so the number of sites is @xmath64 .",
    "the size of the ladder in the dmrg calculation is up to @xmath65 .",
    "we exploited the conservation of the total magnetization @xmath66 to achieve higher precision of the calculations .",
    "the truncation error is of the order of @xmath67 . for the dmrg results ,",
    "the open boundary conditions are used .",
    "a first - order qpt is characterized by a finite discontinuity in the first derivative of the ground state energy . in the similar manner ,",
    "a second - order qpt ( or continuous qpt ) is characterized by a finite discontinuity or divergence in the second derivative of the ground state energy ; here we assume that the first derivative is continuous@xcite .",
    "therefore , to detect the rank of qpt in the frustrated fm ladder , one needs to calculate the ground state energy and its derivative .",
    "in addition , we also measure the spin elementary excitation ( spin gap ) and the local magnetization ( total spin per site ) to identify the ground state phase diagram .",
    "the thermodynamic limit phase diagram is presented in the @xmath32 plane in figure [ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "the phase boundaries are determined by using the dmrg method to perform finite - size scaling .",
    "there exist four states , * a * : fm state , * b * : the canted state , * c@xmath68 * : the dimer @xmath8 state and * c@xmath6 * : the non - dimer @xmath8 spin - stripe state .",
    "it is interesting to find that the canted state only exists in the strong asymmetric case . at @xmath69 ,",
    "the canted state lies in the immediate frustration interval @xmath70 , while the ground state is the fm state at @xmath71 and the dimer phase at @xmath72 .",
    "as @xmath0 is lifted off the zero onset , the canted state regime shrinks gradually .",
    "when @xmath73 , the canted state vanishes and the transition undertakes from the fm state directly to the @xmath8 state upon increasing frustration . in the following we will present numerical evidence and analyze the corresponding pattern .",
    "if the ground state is a fm state , the average energy per site can be exactly determined as @xmath74 where we consider open boundary conditions .",
    "thus , in the fm state , the first derivative of the ground state energy @xmath75 is a constant .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] , we certainly observe the presence of the plateau on @xmath76 in the small @xmath77 regime .",
    "thus we can identify that phase * a * is the fm state . in both figures [ fig : fig4 ]",
    "( a ) and ( b ) , the onsets for the plateau to collapse moves towards to larger @xmath77 with increasing @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore , figure [ fig : fig4 ] ( a ) shows that for @xmath78 the energy derivatives decrease smoothly , whereas figure [ fig : fig4 ] ( b ) shows that for @xmath79 they jump dramatically .",
    "this implies that , at small @xmath31 ( in the highly asymmetric case ) , the phase transition from the fm state to the phase with large @xmath77 is second - order ; otherwise it is first - order .",
    "we notice that the occurrence of the constant @xmath80 collapsed has weak finite - size effect .",
    "thus by small clusters , we can accurately determine the phase boundaries from phase * a * to phase * b * or to phase * c@xmath81*.      to further identify the magnetic nature of phase * b * and * c * , we measure the total spin @xmath82 .",
    "physically , the total spin per site is the local magnetization .",
    "the total spin is defined as @xmath83 here we compute the total spin using lanczs diagonalization , up to @xmath84 with periodic boundary conditions . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] , we can see that at small @xmath77 , the value of @xmath82 remains on @xmath85 , confirming that the ground state is fully polarized and is a fm state . upon increasing @xmath77 to a certain critical value",
    ", @xmath82 deviates from @xmath35 , but in the small @xmath31 regime , the total spin still remains finite .",
    "therefore the ground state is a magnetic state but is partially polarized .",
    "this is similar to the ferrimagnetic state @xcite , which has been observed in mixed - spin systems ( e.g. a spin-1/2 - 1 chain ) . in the classical analogy",
    ", we can identify that phase * b * is the canted state .    on the other side ,",
    "the magnetization totally vanishes ( @xmath8 ) at large @xmath77 .",
    "thus both phase * c@xmath81 * are non - magnetic",
    ". however , the behaviors upon increasing @xmath77 are markedly different for the strong and moderate asymmetric cases . in the small @xmath31 regime ( @xmath86 ) , increased @xmath77 turns the fm state ( phase * a * ) to the canted state ( phase * b * ) and then to the singlet ( @xmath8 ) state .",
    "note that this procedure is subject to the finite - size effect . upon increasing the system size ,",
    "the magnetization plateau will become smooth , and continuously decays to zero . as a consequence , the transitions * a*@xmath87*b * and * b*@xmath87*c@xmath88 * can be classified as second - order . on the other hand , for @xmath79 ,",
    "total spin directly drops to zero , and turns to the singlet states .",
    "this characterizes a first - order transition from * a * @xmath87 * c@xmath81*. the feature of these magnetic transitions is consistent with the previous analysis based on energy derivatives .      to further investigate the ground - state properties of the diagram , in this section , we calculate the spin correlation functions .",
    "the evolution of the spin correlation results as a function of @xmath31 at different @xmath77 can tell us that there must be several distinct phase regimes in the parameter space .",
    "since our calculations are taken in the @xmath66 subspaces , the off - diagonal @xmath89 and diagonal @xmath39 components of the spin correlations show different behavior in different phases .",
    "the magnetic symmetry breaking states , canted and fm states , show that @xmath90 . in the fm states",
    ", it can be easily deduced that all @xmath91 , but the value of @xmath92 can be arbitrary . however , all the zero - total - spin @xmath8 states preserve three - dimension rotational symmetry , so @xmath93 . for simplicity ,",
    "the nearest neighboring spin correlations are designated as follows : @xmath94 , @xmath95 on leg-1 and leg-2 , @xmath96 on rungs , and @xmath97 along the diagonal bonds .",
    "the counterparts along the @xmath39-direction are denoted as : @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively . in the following correlation results , we choose the site index @xmath102 as the middle site and the neighbor site , i.e. @xmath103 and @xmath104 on the @xmath105 ladder .",
    "figure [ fig : fig6 ] reveal the neighbor spin correlations as a function of @xmath31 and with moderate frustration , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively .",
    "the left hand side depicts the full correlation @xmath108 , while the right hand side gives their corresponding @xmath39-directional spin correlation @xmath109 .",
    "let us focus on @xmath106 first , e.g. figures [ fig : fig6 ] ( a ) and ( b ) . in comparison with figure [ fig : fig3 ]",
    ", the system will experience the canted state , a spin - singlet state and the fm by increasing @xmath31 . at strong asymmetry ( @xmath110 ) ,",
    "we can clearly observe @xmath111 , implying a symmetry broken state .",
    "this corresponds to the canted state , phase * b*. we also numerically verified that , the two - site correlation @xmath108 ( beyond the nearest - neighbor distance ) indicates a signal of lone - ranged order in this region . in the intermediate @xmath31 regime ,",
    "@xmath112 , the symmetry breaking feature vanishes .",
    "this shows a non - magnetic state , so the ground state is spin - singlet . in the large @xmath31 regime ,",
    "the full spin correlations in all types are @xmath113 , indicating a fm state . therefore , the evolution of the neighbor spin correlations as a function of @xmath31 is able to consistently describe the phase diagram in figure [ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "similarly , for @xmath107 in figures [ fig : fig6 ] ( c ) and ( d ) , at strong asymmetry ( @xmath114 ) , the correlations also show features of a canted state , and the non - magnetic nature upon increasing @xmath31 .",
    "however , we note that , at @xmath107 and relatively weak asymmetry ( @xmath115 ) , the spin correlations show a behavior different from the fm mentioned in figures [ fig : fig6 ] ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the ground state still has zero total - spin @xmath8 and preserves the three - dimension rotational symmetry in spin correlations .",
    "it can be noted that , in this regime , all @xmath116 , indicating a fm correlation along the leg direction . on the other hand , @xmath117 and @xmath118 show an af correlation between the legs .",
    "therefore , the system is a spin - stripe phase , where spins align parallel along the leg direction , as depicted in figure [ fig : fig2](b ) .",
    "although this state has zero spin excitation , the two - site correlation @xmath108 along the same leg shows an exponential decay , implying that no long - ranged ordering exists in this phase .",
    "this observation is similar to the phase * i * in the previous work@xcite .",
    "interestingly , in the @xmath8 state region , dimerization is detected at relatively strong asymmetry , so there exist two different singlet phases . in figures [ fig : fig6](a)(b ) at @xmath119 , figures [ fig : fig6 ] ( c)(d ) at @xmath120 , and figure [ fig : fig7](a ) at @xmath121 , respectively , the marked amplitude differences between @xmath122 ( hollow black squares ) and its neighbor counterpart @xmath123 ( solid black squares ) are observed .",
    "the dimerization patterns are also found in the diagonal correlations @xmath124 and @xmath125 ( hollow and solid purple circles ) .",
    "furthermore , figure [ fig : fig7](b ) shows that the alternating strengths in spin correlations exist in the entire system . however , the neighbor spin correlations on the leg-2 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 , show nearly uniform magnitudes , or much weaker alternating behavior .",
    "for example , in figure [ fig : fig7](b ) , @xmath128 is either @xmath129 or @xmath130 , but @xmath131 for any @xmath12 .",
    "these features are characteristic of the existence of dimerization on the leg-1 in the case of strong asymmetry and frustration .",
    "however , we would like to make a remark that , the dimerized @xmath8 state in our model is different from the gapped singlet dimerized state@xcite .",
    "the dimers in leg-1 are triplet dimers with fm correlations",
    ". moreover , the state has zero spin excitation , and the two - site correlations decay exponentially .",
    "thus , it is a gapless dimerized state without long - ranged ordering .    to determine the boundary of regions where the dimer phase exists , we define the dimer order parameter as @xmath132 in a finite - size system@xcite .",
    "we determine the phase boundary by observing the vanishing dimer order with the criterion : @xmath133 . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig7](c ) , it is obvious to see that as @xmath31 increases in the @xmath8 regime , the dimer order parameter gradually decreases until vanishing , so there exists a critical transition point @xmath134 between the dimerized @xmath8 state and the non - dimerized @xmath8 state ( spin - stripe ) .",
    "the value of @xmath135 might be size - dependent , i.e. @xmath136 , so we need to perform finite - size analysis to determine @xmath137 .",
    "we selected the sizes up to @xmath65 and show in figure [ fig : fig7](d ) .",
    "the plot shows a linear scaling behavior of critical transition points @xmath138 vs @xmath139 at various @xmath77 . by this approach ,",
    "the phase boundary in the thermodynamic limit can be determined and is depicted in figure [ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "one thing is worthy to put attention . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig7](d ) , note that the curve at @xmath106 is less sensitive to the sizes , comparing to other @xmath77 s .",
    "this transition separates the dimerized state and the fm state , and the fm ground state has relatively weaker finite - size effect . in sec .",
    "[ sect : results ] a , we have mentioned this feature in determining the phase boundaries * a*@xmath87*b * and * a*@xmath87*c@xmath81 * by exact diagonalization .",
    "in summary , we have investigated the ground - state phases of the frustrated asymmetric spin ladder with fm nearest - neighbor interactions using exact diagonalization and the dmrg method . in the strong asymmetric system ( small @xmath31 )",
    ", one can clearly distinguish three phase regimes with frustration increasing : from a pure fm state to a magnetic canted state and then to @xmath8 dimer state .",
    "they are second - order phase transitions . on contrary ,",
    "when the asymmetric strength is relatively weak ( large @xmath31 ) , with frustration increasing , there exists just one first - order phase transition from the fm to the dimerized or to the spin - stripe state , depending on the values of @xmath31 .",
    "we provided numerical evidence , such as ground energy derivatives , total spin , spin correlations and the corresponding order parameters to distinguish the phases and determine the phase diagram .",
