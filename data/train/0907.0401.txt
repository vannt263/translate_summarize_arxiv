    "a _ monotone triangle _ is a triangular array of integers of the following form    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     .",

    "all in all we see that the number of monotone @xmath9trapezoids with fixed top and bottom row as given above is the number of partial monotone triangles with @xmath10 rows and entries in @xmath11 , where for @xmath12 the first @xmath13 entries of the @xmath14th ne  diagonal are missing and the first entry of the truncated diagonal is equal to @xmath15 and does not necessarily have to be strictly smaller than its neighbour to the right and for @xmath16 the last @xmath17 entries in the @xmath14th se  diagonal are missing and the last entry of the truncated diagonal is equal to @xmath18 and does not necessarily have to be strictly greater than its neighbour to the left .",
    "suppose @xmath19 is a function in @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "we define a summation operator @xmath22 by induction with respect to @xmath10 . if @xmath23 then the application of the operator gives zero , for @xmath24 we set @xmath25 .",
    "if @xmath26 then we define @xmath27 with this , we obviously have @xmath28 for @xmath26 .",
    "in fact , if we extend the definition of monotone triangles to triangular integer arrays @xmath29 with weak increase along ne  diagonals and se  diagonals and strict increase along rows with the possible exception of the bottom row which may only be weakly increasing then @xmath6 is also the number of these ( extended ) monotone triangles with bottom row @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath30 and set @xmath31 the recursion shows that @xmath32 and , more general for @xmath33 , @xmath34 similarly , with @xmath35 , it is not hard to see that @xmath36 if we combine these two facts we see that @xmath37    [ gamma1 ]    for @xmath38 and @xmath39 , let @xmath40 ( see figure  [ gamma1 ] ) denote the number of partial monotone triangles with @xmath10 rows that have the following properties .    * for @xmath41 , the first @xmath13 entries of the @xmath14th ne  diagonal are missing . * the first entry of the truncated @xmath14th ne  diagonal is equal to @xmath42 and does neither have to be strictly smaller than its neighbour to the right nor weakly smaller than its se  neighbour . * for @xmath16 , the last @xmath17 entries in the @xmath14th se  diagonal are missing . *",
    "the last entry of the truncated @xmath14th se  diagonal is equal to @xmath42 and does neither have to be strictly greater than its neighbour to the left nor weakly greater than its sw  neighbour . *",
    "the bottom row ( without those entries among @xmath43 that are situated in the bottom row ) is equal to @xmath44 and we do not demand a strict increase for those entries .",
    "we want to show that @xmath45 by induction with respect to @xmath10 .",

    "@xmath51 by the induction hypothesis , this is equal to @xmath52 now , implies that this is furthermore equal to @xmath53 this concludes the proof of .    by the observations from the previous section and , the number of @xmath9trapezoids with @xmath54 as top row and whose bottom row consists of the numbers in @xmath55 , arranged in increasing order , is equal to @xmath56 finally , by the expansion , this number is equal to @xmath57 since @xmath58 and @xmath59 , this is equal to @xmath60 as @xmath61 for all integers @xmath62 , this simplifies to @xmath63 and concludes the proof of theorem  [ 7 ] .",
    "in order to prove we make use of the identity @xmath65 which can be found in ( * ? ? ? * lemma  5 ) .",
    "it implies @xmath66 for @xmath67 .",
    "moreover , for every integer @xmath68 , @xmath69    therefore , @xmath70 this implies that @xmath71 by the chu - vandermonde summation , the right  hand side is equal to @xmath72 consequently , @xmath73 equivalently , by using @xmath74 , @xmath75    in the special case @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , this gives @xmath79 we fix the following notation : @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",

    "in this paper we have shown that the number @xmath63 of monotone @xmath9trapezoids with prescribed top and bottom row ( or , equivalently , the number of certain @xmath99partial alternating sign matrices ) appears as a coefficient of a specialization of @xmath100 with respect to a certain ( binomial ) polynomial basis .",

    "one correspondence between the number of monotone triangles with bottom row @xmath106 and the number of monotone triangles with bottom row @xmath107 and therefore @xmath108 consequently , @xmath109    in terms of the expansion , this means that @xmath110 by the chu ",

    "( this is conjecture  5 from @xcite . )    in fact , we have used the principal that certain identities for @xmath100 translate to identities for the coefficients @xmath63 .",
    "another ( much less interesting ) example in this respect is @xmath115 which translates in a similar way to @xmath116 an identity that is of course ( almost ) obvious from the combinatorial interpretation if @xmath117 and @xmath118 .    for fixed @xmath10 ,",
    "the system of linear equations provides a total of @xmath119 linear equations for the @xmath119 numbers @xmath120 , @xmath121 .",
    "however , computerexperiments show that there is a certain dependency under these linear equations .    for the case @xmath122 ( i.e. the numbers @xmath123 of the refined alternating sign matrix theorem ) , it was shown in @xcite that together with @xmath124 and the symmetry @xmath125 for @xmath126 ( which easily follows from the combinatorial interpretation of the numbers @xmath85 ) provides a system of linear equations that determines the numbers @xmath85 uniquely . in @xcite",
    "we have conjectured that this extends to the case @xmath127 , i.e. the numbers @xmath128 . in this case , we have to add @xmath129 , the near  symmetry @xmath130 for all @xmath131 unless @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "if @xmath134 this near  symmetry also easily follows from the combinatorial interpretation of the numbers @xmath64 , however , for @xmath135 , we took some efforts in @xcite to derive it .",
    "it would be of interest to see whether this ( conjectural ) behaviour extends to the case @xmath136 . by cramer s rule",
    "this would then at least provide a determinantal expression for the numbers @xmath137 .    as mentioned above ,",
    "monotone @xmath9trapezoids correspond to certain @xmath99partial alternating sign matrices .",
    "the latter are generalizations of alternating sign matrices with loosened columnsum restrictions .",
    "clearly , a next natural step would be to consider even more general partial alternating sign matrices , where we loosen the columsum restrictions and the rowsum restrictions .",
    "in particular , the quadruply refined enumeration of alternating sign matrices where we fix top and bottom row as well as the first and the last column of the alternating sign matrix , would be of major interest ."
