    "in the integer quantum hall effect , delocalized states near the center of each landau band play a crucial role@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "when the randomness strength becomes as large as the energy cutoff , it is expected that all the states become localized@xcite .",
    "an appealing scenario for the transitions , which is called the floating or levitaion of the delocalized states , was proposed in refs.@xcite .",
    "it claims that the delocalized states do not diappear discontinuously but float upward in energy with the increase of the randomness strength .",
    "finally , when all the delocalized states rise above the fermi energy , the system becomes the usual anderson insulator .",
    "then a crossover occurs from the unitary class to the orthogonal class .",
    "furthermore , based on the scenario , the global phase diagram was proposed for transitions between different quantum hall states@xcite . recently some controversies arise about the trajectory of the delocalized states @xcite .",
    "there are also experimental discussions on the validity of the global phase diagram @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study transitions between the quantum hall state and the anderson insulator in a tight binding model .",
    "the weak magntic field regime is especially focused on .",
    "it is closely related to the continuum model .",
    "the topological invariant for each energy band ( chern number ) and the thouless number are used as probes for the transitions .",
    "the summation of the chern number below the fermi energy gives the hall conductance .",
    "the thouless number tells us the location of the delocalized states .",
    "this paper is an extended version of our previous letter @xcite including new data and more detailed discussions .",
    "the present article is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "the tight binding hamiltonian is defined and the string ( anyon ) gauge is introduced . the string gauge is essential for the numerical realizaion of the weak magnetic field regime . in section iii ,",
    "key observables in our study are defined : the topological invariant for each energy band ( chern number ) and the thouless number .",
    "section iv is devoted to the statement of a sum rule in the change of the hall conductance . in section",
    "v , the weak magnetic field regime is studied in connection with the continuum model .",
    "the breakdown of the quantized hall conductance due to randomness is demonstrated and the trajectory of the delocalized states is investigated .",
    "the tight binding hamiltonian is @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 denotes a gauge potential and @xmath3 refers to a nearest neighbor . a magnetic field per plaquette is given by @xmath4 ( @xmath5 and @xmath6 are coprime integers ) where the summation runs over four links around a plaquette .",
    "the operator @xmath7 creats ( annihilates ) a spinless fermion at a site @xmath8 .",
    "a random potential at a site @xmath8 is expressed by @xmath9 where @xmath10 s are uniform random numbers and chosen from @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "see , for example , refs.@xcite for previous works on this model .",
    "the integer quantum hall effect is believed to be described by the continuum model . as will be discussed later",
    ", the weak magnetic field regime in the tight binding model is closely related to it .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we focus on the weak magnetic field regime ( e.g. @xmath12 ) . in order to realize the regime numerically",
    ", the choice of a gauge potential plays an important role .",
    "here we employ the string ( anyon ) gauge@xcite .",
    "an example of the string gauge is shown in fig.1 .",
    "the extension to other geometries is straightforward . choosing a plaquette @xmath13 as a starting one , we draw outgoing arrows ( strings ) from the plaquette @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath2 on a link @xmath14 is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the number of strings cutting the link @xmath14 ( the orientation is taken into account ) .",
    "in the string gauge , the compatible magnetic field @xmath17 with the periodicity of the system @xmath18 is @xmath19 ( on the other hand , @xmath20 in the landau gauge ) .",
    "therefore , for a square @xmath21 geometry , one is able to use @xmath22 times smaller magnetic field in the string gauge than in the landau gauge .",
    "in this section , we define key observables to study transitions between the quantum hall state and the anderson insulator .",
    "one is the topological invariant for each energy band ( the chern number ) .",
    "it is closely related to the hall conductance .",
    "the other is the thouless number .",
    "it tells us how the wavefunctions are extended spatially .",
    "the topological invariant for each energy band , chern number , plays an important role in the following arguments . here",
    "the periodicity of @xmath18 is imposed on @xmath2 and @xmath23 and the momentum @xmath24 is well - defined ( the infinite size limit corresponds to @xmath25 ) . the chern number for the @xmath26-th band , @xmath27 , is defined by @xmath28 where @xmath29",
    ", @xmath30 is a bloch wavefunction of the @xmath26-th band with @xmath31 components and the @xmath32-th component is @xmath33 .",
    "the integration @xmath34 runs over the brillouin zone . when the fermi energy lies in the lowest @xmath35-th energy gap , the hall conductance @xmath36 is given by @xmath37@xcite .",
    "when all states in a band are localized , the chern number vanishes .",
    "on the other hand , states with a non - zero chern number contribute to the @xmath36 and we call them extended states.    arbitrarily choosing the @xmath38 and @xmath39-th components of the wavefunction , another expression of the chern number is written as @xmath40 here @xmath41 is a zero point ( vortex ) of @xmath42 in the brillouin zone , @xmath43 is a winding number ( charge ) of the vortex , @xmath44 is a region around @xmath41 which does not include either zero of the @xmath38-th or @xmath39-th component , and @xmath45 is the boundary .",
    "the arbitrariness in the choice of indices @xmath38 and @xmath39 is a kind of gauge degree of freedom .",
    "the configuration of the vortices depends on the gauge choice but the physical observables , e.g. the hall conductance and the position of each extended state , are gauge invariant .      the thouless number @xmath46 is widely used in the study of the anderson localization @xcite ( see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it tells us how the wavefunctions at energy @xmath47 are extended spatially . here a finite @xmath48 cluster is used with a periodic or an antiperiodic boundary condition .",
    "it is defined by @xmath49 where the @xmath50 is an energy shift by replacing the boundary condition and @xmath51 is a local level spacing . by fitting the @xmath46 s to the form @xmath52",
    ", one can determine the @xmath53 which is the localization length when @xmath22 is sufficiently large .",
    "however , when the condition @xmath54 is not satisfied , the @xmath53 can not be identified with the localization length .",
    "for example , in the _ intermediate region _",
    "discussed below , the localization length is extremely long and beyond our available system size .",
    "before going to the weak magnetic field regime , let us explain the change of @xmath55 due to randomness and a _ sum rule _ in the transitions @xcite .",
    "by fixing the gauge in the definition of the chern number , the configuration of vortices are determined in each energy band .",
    "results for @xmath56 and @xmath57 are shown as examples ( figs.2 ) . as the randomness strength @xmath58",
    "is increased , vortices in each band move in energy .",
    "the motion of each vortex is continuous as a function of @xmath58 and it forms a vortex line . therefore the only way for vortices to appear or vanish is the pair - creation or pair - annihilation of them with opposite charges .",
    "although vortices move with the change of @xmath58 , the chern number does not change generally due to its topological stability . when the two bands touch at a critical value of @xmath59 , the spectrum generally becomes that of the dirac fermion @xcite .",
    "define @xmath60 by the gap - closing point in the brillouin zone and focus on the neighborhood i.e. @xmath61 .",
    "then the leading part of the hamiltonian is , in generic , given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a @xmath64 vector , @xmath65 is a @xmath66 pauli matrix and @xmath67 is a @xmath68 matrix . by performing the unitary transformation and the redefinition of @xmath69",
    ", the @xmath70 reduces to @xcite @xmath71 by diagonalizing the @xmath72 , it can be seen that a vortex moves from one band to the other at the gap - closing point and the chern number for each band changes .",
    "then the continuity requires that the total chern numbers of the two bands do not change .",
    "this is the sum rule @xcite .",
    "moreover , the change of @xmath36 with a fixed electron density generally obeys the selection rule @xmath73@xcite .",
    "however , the change of the _ observed _ hall conductance @xmath74 can break the selection rule ( anomalous plateau transition ) . here",
    "the definition of @xmath74 is @xmath75 where @xmath76 and @xmath77 is the fermi distribution function .",
    "then the @xmath78 is obtained as the averaged @xmath79 within an energy window @xmath80 .",
    "therefore we assume @xmath81 where @xmath22 is sufficiently large and @xmath82 is the averaged @xmath79 over different realizations of randomness @xcite .",
    "the @xmath79 is quantized in each realization of randomness even when the fermi energy lies in a small gap @xmath83",
    ". however , since the small gap is sensitive to the randomness realization , the quantization breaks down after the ensemble average .",
    "therefore the anomalous plateau transition @xmath84 occurs ( see also ref.@xcite ) .",
    "it is in contrast to the plateau transition due to the change of electron density where @xmath85 holds even after the ensemble average .",
    "now we shall explore the weak magnetic field regime , which is closely related to the continuuum model . in the following , @xmath17",
    "is fixed as @xmath12 .",
    "it is realized numerically by the string gauge discussed above .",
    "transitions between the quantum hall state and the anderson insulator are investigated by the topological invariant for each energy band ( chern number ) and the thouless number .",
    "the summation of the chern number below the fermi energy gives the hall conductance .",
    "the thouless number tells us the location of the delocalized states .      in figs.3 ,",
    "the density of states ( dos ) and the thouless number @xmath46 are shown for different randomness strengths @xmath58 s . in fig.4 , the voritces are shown as a function of @xmath58 . in figs.5 , the averaged local chern number @xmath86 ( see @xcite for a precise definition ) and its variance @xmath87",
    "are shown with different @xmath58 s . here",
    "@xmath88 denotes an averaged observable @xmath89 over different realizations of randomness .",
    "moreover , in figs.6 , the chern number of the @xmath8-th band @xmath90 and @xmath91 are shown as a function of @xmath58 .",
    "let us first investigate a region with sufficiently weak randomness . as seen in fig.3 ( a ) , there are well - defined landau bands .",
    "the thouless number @xmath46 shows a sharp peak near the center of each landau band .",
    "it is consistent with the result that all the states are localized except at a single energy in each landau band@xcite .",
    "the number of states extended over a @xmath48 sample is @xmath92 and is not macroscopic .",
    "the chern number in each landau band is @xmath93 except in the center band .",
    "the sum of all chern numbers is always zero and the center band has negative chern number @xmath94 . when the fermi energy lies in the landau gap or near the band edge , the @xmath36 does not depend on the randomness realization generally .",
    "then the @xmath36 is quantized to an integer even after the ensemble average and the system belongs to the quantum hall states .",
    "next let us consider the strong - randomness effects . with the increase of @xmath58 ,",
    "the landau gaps collapse from the center ( @xmath95 ) to the bottom ( see figs.3 ) .",
    "as seen in figs.4 - 6 , it is associated with many pair - creations and -annihilations .",
    "extended states with a negative chern number spread from the center to the bottom through the pair - creations and -annihilations and an energy region where @xmath96 but @xmath97 extends over the whole spectrum ( see figs.5 ( c ) and ( d ) ) .",
    "we call it the _ intermediate region_. in this region , the mean free path @xmath98 is comparable with the magnetic length @xmath99 and the internal structure within the magnetic unit cell is irrelevant . then , since the magnetic unit cell contains multiple of the flux quanta , it is effectively gauge equivalent to the zero magnetic field and a crossover occurs from the unitary class to the orthogonal class . in the region ,",
    "the chern number in each band is generally non - zero and quantized to an integer for a given realization of randomness .",
    "however , the chern number depends strongly on the randomness realization .",
    "then the averaged chern number is not an integer and takes a small value due to the cancellation of positive and negative chern numbers in different realizations .",
    "therefore , after the ensemble average , the @xmath36 is no longer quantized to an integer . in the region ,",
    "the energy position of each extended state depends strongly on the randomness realization .",
    "the number of the extended states is not macroscopic and we speculate that the probability measure for the delocalized states to exist is zero in the infinite size limit ( similar region was found in the random magnetic field problem @xcite ) .",
    "when the randomness is stronger , the extended states no longer exisit and @xmath100 in _ each _ realization of randomness . then the system belongs to the usual anderson insulator and the @xmath36 becomes zero .    to summarize : for sufficiently weak randomness , there are delocalized states in each landau band and the system is in the quantum hall state . as the randomness strength",
    "is increased , the landau gaps collapse from the center ( @xmath95 ) to the bottom and the intermediate region extends over the whole spectrum . when the fermi energy lies in the region , the @xmath36 is no longer quantized to an integer .",
    "with sufficiently strong randomness , the system change into the usual anderson insulator and the @xmath101 .      in the above subsection , the magnetic - field strength is kept as @xmath12 and the randomness strength @xmath58 is varied . in this subsection",
    ", we comment on the scaling in the weak magnetic - field limit ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "in the limit ( @xmath103 ) without randomness @xmath104 , the rescaled energy spectrum @xmath105 becomes the landau levels and the system reduces to the continuum model ( @xmath106 is the lowest band gap and @xmath107 is the energy cut - off in the lattice model ) . in the limit ,",
    "the magnetic length @xmath108 is much larger than the lattice spacing i.e. @xmath109 .",
    "when the @xmath58 is increased to @xmath110 , the width of the lowest landau band becomes comparable with the landau gap . in the weak field limit , @xmath111 but @xmath112@xcite .",
    "it implies that the lowest landau band is robust in the continuum limit .",
    "therefore , before the lowest landau gap closes , higher landau bands merge and the reconstruction of eigenstates occurs through the pair - creation and -annihilation",
    ". then the floating is not the only way for the delocalized states to disappear .",
    "for stronger randomness ( @xmath113 ) , all the states are in the intermediate region . in this region , the localization length is extremely large . finally , when @xmath114 , the system belongs to the usual anderson insulator .",
    "at last , let us discuss the fate of delocalized states . in fig.7 , the trajectory of the delocalized states is shown for the lowest landau band ( @xmath115 ) and the second one ( @xmath116 ) . in order to search the trajectory ,",
    "the thouless number @xmath46 is obtained for @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 ( the ensemble average is performed over @xmath120 different realizations of randomness ) .",
    "the energy position of the delocalized states is obtained by searching the peak position of @xmath46 in each landau band . for the full circles",
    ", we also confirmed that the localiztion length @xmath53 is the largest at the point in each landau band ( see the inset of fig.7 as an example ) .",
    "it can be observed that their positions are going down in energy with the increase of randomness strength @xmath58 . at the same time , as seen in figs.3 , the density of states also shifts downwards .",
    "then , in the lowest landau band , the delocalized states floats or levitates slightly@xcite .",
    "however there is no sign of the floating across the landau gap .",
    "the way how the delocalized states disappear is also shown in fig.7 . after the collapse of the landau gap , the intermediate region extends over the whole spectrum and the delocalized states mix in the region .",
    "even after the collapse , the peak positions of @xmath46 can be defined for each landau band and they are also shown by the open circles . in the region ,",
    "the positions have a large fluctuation and they finally merge when @xmath58 is sufficiently large .",
    "in fact , for a given realization of randomness , we can further trace the trajectory of states which carry non - zero chern number , and it finally disappear through the pair - annihilation@xcite . however , since their positions in the region depend strongly on the randomness realization , we speculate that the probability density for the states to be delocalized is zero .",
    "in summary , we studied transitions between the quantum hall state and the anderson insulator based on the tight - binding model .",
    "aspects of the transitions are revealed by the topological arguments and the thouless number study . in the weak randomness region , there are delocalized states in each landau band and the system is in the quantum hall state . as the randomness becomes stronger , the landau gaps collapse from the center ( @xmath95 ) to the bottom .",
    "accompanied by the collapse , the intermediate region with a large localization length extends over the whole spectrum . when the fermi energy lies in the region , the hall conductance is not generally quantized to an integer .",
    "the delocalized states in each landau band mix in the region successively and , finally , the system belongs to the anderson insulator .",
    "this work was supported in part by grant - in - aid from the ministry of education , science and culture of japan and also kawakami memorial foundation .",
