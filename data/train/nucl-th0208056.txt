    "one very interesting question which arises in our search for examples of quark - gluon matter is the apparent absence , or at least the paucity of examples of elementary hadrons possessing more than three quarks .",
    "there is perhaps one good candidate for an exotic meson consisting of two quarks combined with two anti - quarks : _ viz _ the @xmath5 1410 thought to be an @xmath6 state @xcite , but there is not likely an equally good candidate for a @xmath7 state or glueball .",
    "the perhaps more distinguishable h - dibaryon @xcite has also not yet shown up on its own in any experimental search and it has proved to be equally elusive in theoretical analysis . surely , however , strange matter must be present at the heart of virtually all gravitationally collapsed objects @xcite .",
    "nothing new is offered here with respect to the mesonic possibilities : but the presence of more than a single strange quark in dibaryons and light nuclei is explored in more detail .    during this presentation , we wish to cover two apparently disparate subjects : ( 1 ) the production of the h - dibaryon in both elementary and heavy ion induced reactions , and ( 2 ) the generation of very light to moderately light @xmath0 hypernuclei .",
    "both subjects concern @xmath0 systems and they are quite possibly tied together by the possible presence within finite systems of a hybrid h , possibly constructed both from dibaryon @xmath8 and from @xmath9-quark bag like ( @xmath10 ) components , _ viz _ :    @xmath11    with @xmath12 being amplitudes for the two - body and @xmath9-quark components of the hybrid state .",
    "the purely jaffe - like h state @xcite corresponds to @xmath13 .",
    "our later coalescence calculation for the formation of an @xmath3 is independent of this parameter .",
    "the procedure we follow to estimate the effect of a repulsive core on entry from a doorway @xmath8 state into the final h is applicable to either the pure bag or hybrid cases .",
    "we begin by indicating that the seeming absence of the h in existing searches is perhaps attributable to repulsive ( soft - core ) forces in the baryon - baryon system , which prevent penetration to short range of a @xmath8 pair during any mechanism for formation of the dihyperon structure .",
    "however , one might anticipate to the contrary , that within a finite nucleus two @xmath2 s could be held together for sufficient time to permit a short range structure to develop .",
    "since the first of these subjects , h - suppression , has been described elsewhere @xcite , it will only be briefly dealt with here . to our knowledge all theoretical estimates of production rates @xcite , irrespective of mechanism , have overlooked the possibility of a repulsive core in the baryon - baryon interaction at short distances .",
    "as we show , under reasonable assumptions the core can lead to an appreciable diminution of h yield .",
    "we introduce this device in the context of heavy ion collisions where a previous calculation @xcite suggested a high formation probability , @xmath14 per central au + au collision .",
    "the ags experiment e896 @xcite is presently analysing some 100 million central au + au events and could , in the light of this previous estimate , have provided a definitive search for the h. in reference @xcite we presented an estimate of the extent to which a repulsive core might interfere with this hope .",
    "we put forward first the simplest possible theoretical description of the multi - quark systems ; then we consider the , successful or otherwise , experimental searches for such objects .",
    "this is followed by a description of the related attempts to produce multi - strange nuclei .",
    "soon after the introduction of the mit bag model @xcite , used to consider the normal hadrons , mesons constructed from a single quark - antiquark pair and baryons containing three quarks , jaffe @xcite proposed the insertion into the bag of extra valence quarks could produce more exotic systems .",
    "for meson states these additional components could be quarks only @xmath15 or could be hybrids of quarks and glue @xmath16 .",
    "glueball states , @xmath17 , were already on the table .",
    "jaffe also suggested the existence of the h - dibaryon which could be described as a @xmath9-quark bag ( uu , dd , ss ) @xcite .",
    "of course , the easiest meson candidates to identify would be the so - called exotics , _",
    "i.  e. _  those with quantum numbers which can not arise from ( @xmath18 ) alone .",
    "examples of exotic quantum numbers are states characterised by @xmath19 .",
    "the basic theory covering all these states in the bag model is essentially the same .",
    "the total energy for n quarks in a bag of radius r may be written @xcite :    @xmath20    with a quark kinetic energy @xmath21,\\ ] ]    where @xmath22 is a wave number , and @xmath23 \\,\\,(\\lambda^a_i \\lambda^a_j)\\,\\,\\,.\\ ] ]    here @xmath24 , is the color magnetic energy of one - gluon exchange from quark to quark .",
    "the other terms @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the volume bag pressure and the bag zero point energy respectively .",
    "the bag parameters suggested by analysis of the normal hadron spectrum involve a rather large gluon exchange coupling @xmath27 , a bag constant @xmath28 mev , vacuum energy @xmath29 , and finally a rather large mass for the strange quark , @xmath30 mev .",
    "the matrix element , @xmath24 , obtained in the bag for the color - magnetic operators is approximated by a diagonal matrix for strange quarks ; @xmath31 with @xmath32 the number of strange quarks .    to proceed , one constructs anti - symmetric wave functions in color , spin and flavour , diagonalises the energy exploiting the existing @xmath33 symmetry and then minimises the whole with respect to bag radius .",
    "the general range found for the masses of @xmath34 states is from @xmath35 mev ( @xmath36 ) to @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) mev .",
    "a reasonably good candidate for such an exotic is the @xmath39 , referred to above @xcite , identified in @xmath40 scattering . in particular thompson _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite find a resonant final state @xmath41 component to which they assign a mass of @xmath42 mev and a width of @xmath43 mev .",
    "no state of similar status has been isolated for other quark hybrids or glueballs .",
    "the @xmath0 h - dibaryon , considered more extensively hereafter , is found by jaffe , through reasoning similar to that above , to be some @xmath44 mev bound .",
    "this highly symmetric object is in principle more likely to exist than its meson - like compatriots .",
    "the h possesses conserved baryon and strangeness numbers , _ viz _ @xmath45 .",
    "if it were a purely hadronic state its wave function would appear as    @xmath46    more recent estimates of the mass of the h have differed from jaffe s original estimate and from each other .",
    "indeeed , there is no consensus among theorists that the h is in fact a bound object",
    ". there is , however , general agreement on the results of the many searches which have been made for this state : it is not yet found .",
    "conventional hypernuclear studies @xcite exploit the elementary processes @xmath47 , @xmath48 the first produces an effective @xmath49 beam , incident on another nucleus in the target and thus generates a di - lambda .",
    "the latter pair may or may not form the putative h. the same experimental approach could of course yield doubly strange hypernuclei .",
    "an advantageous target for the @xmath49 beam is the deuteron , resulting hopefully in an h plus a monoenergetic neutron .",
    "the latter is relatively easily identified .",
    "another approach , used in the bnl experiment e896 @xcite exploits the large numbers of @xmath2 s , some @xmath50 per event , generated in relativistic @xmath51 collisions . here",
    "again the results have been so far negative .",
    "one good reason for the lack of success of these experiments lies in the nature of the production of a bound di - lambda state . for two strange baryons to coalesce into a bag",
    "they must first penetrate the mutually repulsive core of the potential . suppression of the yield for a spatially very extended object like the deuteron is minimal .",
    "this is not so for the h , which consists of six quarks in a bag comparable in size to that of a single baryon , so that short range repulsion , found in @xmath52 interactions and expected to exist for strange baryon - baryon interactions as well , could play a considerable role .",
    "h formation from two @xmath2s can be viewed as proceeding in two steps : merging into a broad deuteron - like state followed by barrier penetration into the bag .",
    "the overall rate is then proportional to the product of the probability of coalescence @xcite with a prefactor giving the penetration probability .",
    "of course there are unknowns , one the @xmath8 separation @xmath53 at which the two bags would dissolve into a single bag , the other the nature of the short range forces after dissolution .",
    "the first , @xmath53 , we treated as a parameter ; the second we took from the bonn potential @xcite , limiting our considerations to the shortest ranged @xmath54 and @xmath55 components .",
    "since the exchange of a @xmath56 meson between @xmath57 quarks very nearly matches that of an @xmath54 between ordinary quarks , the bonn interaction needs little readjustment for strange - strange interaction .",
    "thus we take the short range force , appropriate to the penetration of the core and depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] , to be of the form    @xmath58    where @xmath59    the strong short range @xmath55 attraction reduces the effect of the hard core , while the longer range parts of the force are assumed to play a negligible role",
    ". the two baryons approach to some outer radius @xmath53 , in fact a turning point , before being faced with the strong repulsion .",
    "the calculation is especially sensitive to this separation @xmath53 .",
    "although our final results on barrier penetration are consequently somewhat uncertain , it will become apparent that the one thing one can not do is to ignore them .",
    "barrier penetration in an effective two body model can the quantified in the transmission coefficient @xcite at relative energy @xmath60 :    @xmath61    where @xmath62    the chief results , as they relate to coalescence into di - baryons in au + au collisions , are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] , indicating the variation of h - dibaryon yield with @xmath53 .",
    "this latter parameter must not be thought of as an effective hard core radius for the @xmath8 interaction .",
    "the underlying quark - quark forces may be viewed as possessing a repulsive short range component due to the exchange of vector mesons @xcite . even with complete overlap of the parent baryons the average interquark separation for a uniform spatial distribution is comparable to the parent radius @xmath63 fermis , _ i.  e. _  considerably greater than any conceivable fixed hard core .",
    "we have concentrated on baryon centers between @xmath64 and @xmath65 fermis apart as a reasonable range .    at the largest @xmath53 suppression from the repulsive forces",
    "is not inconsiderable , but for the smallest @xmath53-values observation of the h , should it exist , becomes difficult .",
    "early analysis of the actual experimental setup using the heavy ion simulation arc @xcite , suggested a neutral background comparable with the initial estimate of @xmath66 @xmath3 s per central collision . for baryon separations of @xmath64 to @xmath67 fermis one would have to achieve a tracking sensitivity of @xmath68 to @xmath69 relative to background .",
    "even in the worst case scenario one is still left with perhaps a few thousand sample dibaryons , from the very large number of central au + au events , but they are immersed in what may prove to be a daunting background .    we conclude that short range repulsion between strange baryons can profoundly hinder coalescence into objects whose very existence depends on the presence of important bag - like structure .",
    "this lesson applies even more to the many h - searches initiated in @xmath1 reactions @xcite , since these generally involve even lower relative energies @xmath60 .",
    "unfortunately the very same repulsive forces which made coalescence into a bound state difficult , may also , at the quark level , destroy the existence of any such state .",
    "there is perhaps one way to circumvent this frustrating barrier to the discovery of the lightest of all possible strangelets . in the event a pair of @xmath2s",
    "is attached , through a @xmath1 reaction , to a light nucleus , a hybrid h may form , _",
    "i.  e. _  the h described above containing both dibaryon and six quark bag components . in a light nucleus , for example @xmath4h , the extra nucleons in this four particle system keep the captured hyperons together for some @xmath70 picoseconds , far more than enough time for penetration of the rather modest @xmath71 gev barrier between them . in any case the search for @xmath0 hypernuclei , the only strangelets we are certain exist , is highly interesting in its own right .",
    "an ongoing ags experiment , e906 @xcite , focuses on these nuclei and as we indicate may have already provided evidence for their existence @xcite .    in e906",
    "@xcite the ( @xmath72 ) reaction on a @xmath73be target is employed to produce a tagged beam of @xmath49s .",
    "the @xmath49 in turn may convert into a pair of @xmath2s by interaction with a proton , either in the nucleus in which it was produced or by subsequent interaction with another @xmath73be nucleus .",
    "it is in an emulsion experiment at kek @xcite that one such hypernuclei was found with perhaps other examples from prowse @xcite and danysz et al @xcite .",
    "indeed , all three of these candidates for double hypernuclei were interpreted as possessing a @xmath8 pairing energy @xmath74 mev @xcite .",
    "such a high value is unexpected from existing , albeit theoretical , knowledge of hyperon - hyperon forces .",
    "it was then possible to surmise interesting activity in the @xmath8 system at short range separation .    given the @xmath75 beam energy of @xmath76 gev , the tagged @xmath49s initially possess considerable kinetic energy , @xmath77 mev , and are more likely than not to escape the nucleus in which they are produced .",
    "a guiding principle we employ in qualitatively understanding the broad aspects of the data , is that final states containing the very stable @xmath78he are favoured .",
    "this picture is also mindful of an oft used cluster model for @xmath73be as two @xmath79-particles joined together by a weakly bound neutron .",
    "the @xmath73be target is useful in slowing down the @xmath49 , but the observed reactions are for the most part initiated essentially on an @xmath79 .",
    "further , in the present experiment which observes @xmath0 final states by their decay into two momentum - correlated @xmath80 s , the heaviest @xmath81 systems will decay weakly predominantly through non - mesonic channels .",
    "thus the lightest systems are probably doubly favoured in our data , through both their production and their decay dynamics .",
    "the measurements which contain evidence for possible @xmath8 hypernuclei are highlighted in fig .",
    "[ fig:3_906 ] . displayed are the two - dimensional , dalitz plot for the total sample of correlated",
    "two @xmath80 decays recorded in the cds detector @xcite , and the projections of this data on the @xmath82 and @xmath83 axes .",
    "these denote the low and high momenta for the @xmath84 and @xmath85 pair detected in an event .",
    "the circled feature in the 2-d plot is of principle interest , giving rise to the prominent peaks near @xmath86 mev / c in insert i and a correlated peak at @xmath87 mev / c in ii .",
    "the experiment is searching for pairs of pion momenta unexplained from previous knowledge of hypernucleon lines . the expected spectrum close to the region of interest in e906",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4_906 ] , with single hypernuclear lines indicated vertically and doubly strange candidates diagonally .",
    "the slope in the latter denotes the dependence of the @xmath0 energy as a function of the important pairing energy @xmath88 .    the higher momentum structure in i near @xmath89 mev / c is understood as the decay in flight of @xmath49 hyperons , but the width of the lower peak is too broad to be due to a single component line .",
    "the very prominent peak in ii is completely unexpected .",
    "the high momentum @xmath80 peak in i arises in part from the decay of @xmath90h yielding a meson line at @xmath91 mev / c , but considering the experimental resolution of @xmath92 mev , this @xmath85 prominence at @xmath93 mev must contain more structure .    the projection in ii is constructed from a reverse cut @xmath94 mev / c , _",
    "i.  e. _  under the first compound peak in ii , and thus should reveal the low momentum @xmath95 correlated with the @xmath93 mev / c peak in i. the most striking feature in ii is the narrow prominence near @xmath96 gev / c , which can not for example be accounted for by single @xmath2 decay in a @xmath97 + @xmath2 final state , or for that matter by any other known line . adding even a small kinetic energy to the @xmath49 initiating",
    "the reaction leading to the final @xmath0 state would broaden the single @xmath2 decay well beyond that measured for the the dominant peak in this reverse cut .",

    "[ fig:3_906 ] i is strong evidence for the presence of a light double-@xmath2 species in the data .",
    "[ fig:4_906 ] , @xcite , indicates where known single @xmath2 hypernuclear lines are expected as well as where @xmath0 lines are anticipated as a function of the pairing energy @xmath98 .",
    "reiterating , the most interesting feature in the present data , centered at @xmath99 mev / c , could only result from the production of @xmath4h and/or @xmath100h .",
    "@xmath4h has two generic modes of decay :    @xmath101    or @xmath102    the two body decay in the first mode yields the high energy @xmath103 from which the @xmath4h @xmath88 can in principle be estimated , and is followed by a three body decay producing the correlated @xmath84 .",
    "the very narrowness of the @xmath95 peak in ii suggests that the decay mode in equation 7 is not strictly three body in character .",
    "we offer as a candidate a resonance in @xmath104he , arrived at by decay from the clearly spatially extended @xmath105 and thus not favoured in production from @xmath106 .",
    "the first , lower , @xmath107 momentum from the initial decay would then be sensitive to the sum @xmath108 . preliminary theoretical calculations @xcite indicate that indeed a narrow @xmath109-wave resonance can be placed near @xmath110 mev in the p + @xmath90h system , using a potential consistent with the rather extended geometry of @xmath90h and constrained by the known proton binding in the ground state of @xmath104he .",
    "there is little to add to the above discussion of multi - quark elementary systems .",
    "the search for the h is certainly complicated by our analysis of the mechanism of its formation .",
    "the discovery and study of @xmath0 hypernuclei will , however , continue either at the ags or at the anticipated japanese hadron facility .    for e906",
    "there were @xmath111 events in the total two prong sample , some @xmath112 above background in the first feature in fig .",
    "[ fig:3_906 ] i. the reverse cut in ii can be used to isolate the three body decays of @xmath113 and from the simulation an estimate of the two body , resonant , decays can also be made .",
    "we conclude then a lower limit of @xmath114 @xmath4h have been produced in these two modes respectively .",
    "unfortunately , the important di - lambda pairing energy is not well determined in the present experiment . a simulation of fig .",
    "[ fig:3_906 ] i suggests @xmath115 mev while that in fig .",
    "[ fig:3_906 ] ii involving the combination with @xmath116 is perhaps described by a value closer to @xmath117 mev .",
    "more recent emulsion experiments @xcite have definitively identified the species @xmath118he and agree with the lower values of @xmath119 , finding something less than @xmath120 mev .",
    "the motivation for a hybrid h living within some light nucleus then recedes",
    ".    clearly , better statistics and an improvement in resolution are required to determine the @xmath8 pairing energy definitively , and more importantly to establish the actual presence of the large numbers of light doubly strange hypernuclei suggested by e906 .",
    "the principal issues to be settled , presumably in a follow on experiment , are the existence or not of more than one contribution to the broad lower peak in the higher momentum @xmath95 spectrum and the very exciting possibility that more than one species of double @xmath2 resides in the data .",
    "significantly higher counting rate should allow cuts to be placed on the @xmath49 kinetic energy and determine the nature of the reaction mechanism producing individual doubly strange species .",
