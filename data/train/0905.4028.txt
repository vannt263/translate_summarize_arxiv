    "attempts to construct a quantum model of gravity starting from the geometrical description of classical case in general relativity may be characterized as very poor in its possible consequences .",
    "the classical limit has not any clear physical mechanism of formation of the metric , and it is similar to the newtonian version where the law of gravity is postulated .",
    "there are a few facts which may be considered as contradicting to the mainstream in this field of physics : the pioneer anomaly @xcite , the discovery of quantum states of ultra - cold neutrons in the earth s gravitational field with very low energies of levels @xcite ; perhaps , we should include in the list the problem of dark matter in galaxies .",
    "many people are searching for dark energy , an existence of which has been claimed on a basis of the standard cosmological model ; but the initial cause for this conclusion may be put in our list , too .",
    "i would like to review here some results of my work in a non - geometrical approach to quantum gravity , which is based on the assumptions that : 1 ) gravitons are super - strong interacting particles and 2 ) the low - temperature graviton background exists .",
    "this model of low - energy quantum gravity has many interesting consequences , and the one may pave the alternative way to the future theory . to be shorter , i use here notations of my cited works .",
    "it was shown by the author @xcite that screening the background of super - strong interacting gravitons creates for any pair of bodies both attractive and repulsive forces due to pressure of gravitons .",
    "for single gravitons , these forces are approximately equal .",
    "if single gravitons are pairing , an attractive force due to pressure of such graviton pairs is twice exceeding a corresponding repulsive force if graviton pairs are destructed by collisions with a body .",
    "in such the model , the newton constant may be computed .",
    "the attractive force @xmath0 due to pressure of single gravitons in this model is equal to : @xmath1 where the constant @xmath2 is : @xmath3 with @xmath4 by @xmath5 @xmath6 that is of three order greater than the newton constant , @xmath7 if single gravitons are elastically scattered , they create a repulsive force @xmath8 which is equal to @xmath9 but for black holes which absorb any particles and do not re - emit them , we will have @xmath10 it means that such the objects would attract other bodies with a force which is proportional to @xmath2 but not to @xmath11 i.e. einstein s equivalence principle would be violated for them .    in a case of graviton pairing , a force of attraction of two bodies @xmath12 due to pressure of graviton pairs will be equal to : @xmath13 where @xmath14 the difference @xmath15 between attractive and repulsive forces is twice smaller : @xmath16 where the constant @xmath17 is : @xmath18 if one assumes that @xmath19 then it gives for the new constant @xmath20 : @xmath21    the inverse square law takes place in the model if the condition of big distances is fulfilled : @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "it leads to the necessity of some `` atomic structure '' of matter for working the described quantum mechanism ; it is a unique demand for known models of gravity .",
    "recently , it was shown in @xcite that asymptotic freedom appears at very short distances in this model . in this range , the screened portion of gravitons tends to the fixed value of @xmath23 , that leads to the very small limit acceleration of the order of @xmath24 of any screened micro - particle .",
    "= 6.0 cm    the ratio @xmath25 describes the screened portion of gravitons for a big distance @xmath26 . for small @xmath26 ,",
    "let us consider fig .",
    "1 , where @xmath27 , @xmath28 is the screening area .",
    "it is necessary to replace the ratio @xmath29 by the following one : @xmath30    to find the net force of gravitation @xmath15 at a small distance @xmath26 , we should replace the factor @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( 31 ) of @xcite with the more exact factor @xmath32 .",
    "then we get : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is an energy of particle 1 , and @xmath35 is the function of @xmath26 : @xmath36 where @xmath37 . by @xmath38 , this function s limit for any @xmath39",
    "is : @xmath40 . for comparison ,",
    "graphs of the function @xmath35 are shown in fig . 2 for    = 6.0 cm    the following different energies : @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the functions have the same limit by @xmath38 , but the most interesting thing is their different transition to this limit when @xmath26 decreases .",
    "the range of transition for a proton is between @xmath43 meter , while for an electron it is between @xmath44 meter .",
    "the property of asymptotic freedom leads to the important consequence : a black hole mass threshold should exist @xcite .",
    "due to forehead collisions with gravitons , an energy of any photon should decrease when it passes through the sea of gravitons . from another side , none - forehead collisions of photons with gravitons of the background",
    "will lead to an additional relaxation of a photon flux , caused by transmission of a momentum transversal component to some photons .",
    "it will lead to an additional dimming of any remote objects , and may be connected with supernova dimming .",
    "average energy losses of a photon with an energy @xmath45 on a way @xmath46 will be equal to : @xmath47 where @xmath48 . in this model , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is an average graviton energy . as a result",
    ", we have : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is an initial value of energy .",
    "both redshifts and the additional relaxation of any photonic flux due to non - forehead collisions of gravitons with photons lead in the model to the following luminosity distance @xmath53 @xmath54 where @xmath55 , with the factor @xmath56 for soft radiation .",
    "it is easy to find a value of the factor @xmath57 in another marginal case - for a very hard radiation .",
    "due to very small ratios of graviton to photon momenta , photon deflection angles will be small , but collisions will be frequent because the cross - section of interaction is a bilinear function of graviton and photon energies in this model .",
    "it means that in this limit case @xmath58 for an arbitrary source spectrum , a value of the factor @xmath57 should be still computed .",
    "it is clear that @xmath59 and in a general case it should depend on a rest - frame spectrum and on a redshift .",
    "it is important that the hubble diagram in the model is a multivalued function of a redshift : for a given @xmath60 @xmath57 may have different values @xcite .    using only the luminosity distance and a geometrical one as functions of a redshift in this model , theoretical predictions for galaxy / quasar number counts",
    "may be found @xcite .",
    "for example , galaxy number counts as a function of a redshift @xmath61 may be characterized with the function @xmath62 for which we have in this model : @xmath63 a graph of this function is shown in fig .",
    "3 ; the typical error bar and data point are added here from paper @xcite by loh and spillar .",
    "there is not a visible contradiction with observations .",
    "_ there is not any free parameter in the model to fit this curve ; _ it is a very rigid case .    = 6.0 cm",
    "to compute the average time delay of photons , it is necessary to find a number of collisions on a small way @xmath64 and to evaluate a delay due to one act of interaction .",
    "let us consider at first the background of single gravitons .",
    "given the expression for @xmath65 in the model , we can write for the number of collisions with gravitons having an energy @xmath66 : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is described by the plank formula . in the forehead collision ,",
    "a photon loses the momentum @xmath69 and obtains the energy @xmath70 ; it means that for a virtual photon we will have : @xmath71 the uncertainty of energy for a virtual photon @xmath72 .",
    "if we evaluate the lifetime of a virtual photon on a basis of the uncertainties relation : @xmath73 , we get @xmath74 . in the time @xmath75",
    ", the time delay @xmath76 will be equal to : @xmath77 the full time delay due to gravitons with an energy @xmath70 is : @xmath78 .",
    "taking into account all frequencies , we find the full time delay on the way @xmath64 : @xmath79 the full time delay on the way @xmath64 will be maximal for @xmath80 and it is easy to evaluate the one : @xmath81 on the way @xmath26 the time delay is : @xmath82 in this model : @xmath83 ; let us introduce a constant : @xmath84 , then @xmath85 we see that for @xmath86 the maximal time delay is equal to @xmath87 , i.e. the one is negligible . if we take into account graviton pairing , the estimate of delay becomes smaller .",
    "if we consider another possibility of lifetime estimation , for example , @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the proper lifetime of a virtual photon ( it should be considered as a new parameter of the model ) , taking into account that now : @xmath90 we shall get in the same manner ( my paper about the time delay is now in progress ) : @xmath91 where @xmath52 is an initial photon energy , @xmath92 is a new constant : @xmath93 .    in this case , the time delay of photons with different initial energies @xmath94 and @xmath95 will be proportional to the difference @xmath96 , and more energetic photons should arrive later , also as in the first case .",
    "it is still necessary to calculate the dispersion of the delay . to find @xmath97",
    ", we must compare the computed value of time delay with future observations .",
    "recently , an analysis of time - resolved emissions from the gamma - ray burst grb 081126 @xcite showed that the optical peak occurred @xmath98 _",
    "later _ than the second gamma peak ; perhaps , it means that this delay is connected with the mechanism of burst .",
    "the observed pioneer anomaly @xcite has the following main features : 1 ) in the range 5 - 15 au from the sun it is observed an anomalous sunward acceleration with the rising modulus which gets its maximum value ; 2 ) for greater distances , this maximum sunward acceleration remains almost constant for both pioneers ; 3 ) it is observed an unmodeled annual periodic term in residuals for pioneer 10 @xcite which is obviously connected with the motion of the earth . in a frame of this model , a universal character of gravitational interaction should lead to energy losses of any massive body due to forehead collisions with gravitons , so the body acceleration @xmath99 by a non - zero velocity @xmath100 is equal to : @xmath101 for small velocities : @xmath102 if the hubble constant @xmath65 is equal to its theoretical estimate in this approach @xmath103 a modulus of the acceleration will be equal to @xmath104 that is of the same order of magnitude as a value of the observed additional acceleration @xmath105 for nasa probes . the acceleration @xmath106 is directed against a body velocity in the frame of reference in which the graviton background is isotropic .",
    "this acceleration will have different directions by motion of a body on a closed orbit .",
    "the observed value of anomalous acceleration of pioneer 10 should represent the vector difference of the two accelerations @xcite : an acceleration of pioneer 10 relative to the graviton background , and an acceleration of the earth relative to the background .",
    "perhaps , namely the last one is displayed as an annual periodic term in the residuals of pioneer 10 @xcite .",
    "an observed value of the projection of the probe s acceleration on the sunward direction @xmath107 should depend on accelerations of the probe , the earth and the sun relative to the graviton background .",
    "if the sun moves relative to the background slowly enough , then anomalous accelerations of the earth and the probe would be directed almost against their velocities in the heliocentric frame , and in this case : @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is an angle between a radius - vector of the probe and its velocity in the frame . by the very elongate orbits of the both pioneers",
    ", it would explain the second ( and main ) peculiarity .",
    "for example , for pioneer 10 at the distance 67 au from the sun one has @xmath110 , i.e. @xmath111 if for big distances from the sun we use the conservation laws of energy and angular momentum in the field _ of the sun only",
    "_ , then in the range 6.7 - 67 au a value of @xmath112 changes from 0.942 to 0.994 , i.e. approximately on 5 per cent only .",
    "due to this fact , a projection of the probe s acceleration on the sunward direction would be almost constant @xcite .",
    "as toth and turyshev report @xcite , they intend to carry out an analysis of newly recovered data received from pioneers , with these data are now available for pioneer 11 for distances 1.01 - 41.7 au . if the serious problem of taking into account the solar radiation pressure at small distances is precisely solved ( modeled ) @xcite , then this range will be very lucky to confront the expression @xmath108 of the considered model with observations for small distances when pioneer 11 executed its planetary encounters with jupiter and saturn . in this period ,",
    "a value of @xmath112 was changed in the non - trivial manner .",
    "for example , when the spacecraft went to saturn , @xmath112 was _ negative _ during some time .",
    "if this model is true , the anomaly in this small period should have _ the opposite sign_. it would be the best of all to compare the two functions of the probe s proper time : the projection of anomalous acceleration of pioneer 11 and @xmath112 for it .",
    "these functions should be very similar to each other if my conjecture is true . at present , a new mission to test the anomaly is planned @xcite .",
    "it is seen from this consideration that it would be desirable to have a closed orbit for this future probe , or the one with two elongate branches where the probe moves off the sun and towards it .",
    "this deceleration of massive bodies by the graviton background may lead to an additional _ relative _ acceleration of bodies in a closed system .",
    "for example , when a galaxy moves through the background , a deceleration of its center will be constant , but for orbiting it stars the same deceleration will change its sign .",
    "the kinetic energy of stars should increase with time in the rest frame of the center .",
    "perhaps , namely the fact obeys successes of mond by m. milgrom in explanation of flat rotation curves of galaxies @xcite ( and its failure for clusters of galaxies ) . in mond , when a body acceleration gets the threshold value of @xmath113 one introduces by hand the growth of interaction ; but namely this value characterizes the pioneer anomaly in this model .",
    "i hope that this model may help us to see and to realize some fresh ideas in the very old area .",
    "the coincidence of the magnitude of the anomalous deceleration of pioneer 10/11 with the product value of @xmath114 , and an appearance of the same quantity in the mond can not be due to a chance .",
    "many consequences of the model have an impact on our understanding of cosmological problems , and these very close ties between micro and macro cosmoses are very exiting .",
