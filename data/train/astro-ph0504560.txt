    "inflationary paradigm has dominated cosmology since long ago and recently its predictions have attained excellent observational evidence . however at present there exists no preferred concrete inflationary scenario based on a convincing realistic high energy physics model .",
    "it is therefore interesting to explore every single theoretical possibility which leads to inflation along with specific predictions .    in the standard chaotic inflation scenario @xcite",
    "the massive inflaton field rolls down its potential . if its initial amplitude is much larger than planck mass @xmath0 , the hubble friction is large and inflaton field is in the `` slow - roll '' regime where its potential energy dominates over its kinetic energy . in this case",
    "the energy density during `` slow - roll '' is nearly a constant and the equation of state is nearly that of the cosmological constant .",
    "the exit from such inflationary regime occurs when the hubble parameter becomes of order of inflaton mass .",
    "when this happens the inflaton field starts to behave as ordinary matter and later decays into light particles .",
    "this simple model describes current observations rather well .",
    "there are numerous examples which develop this idea further @xcite .",
    "the predictions of all these models are quite similar , so that even the recent accurate measurements @xcite did not put too much pressure on the viability of most of these models .",
    "probably the most serious constraint is the presently unobserved and , thus , necessarily small fraction of isocurvature fluctuations in the primordial spectrum .",
    "these fluctuations generically arise in multi - field models .",
    "the other constraint comes from the nongaussianity in the primordial spectrum @xcite .",
    "future experiments on the detection of the gravitational background radiation @xcite left after inflation may impose further significant constraints on the inflationary models @xcite .",
    "most of the inflationary models can be classified as _ potential induced _ ,",
    "i.e. inflation is driven by the potential terms in the lagrangian of a scalar field .",
    "this is , however , not the only theoretical approach to implement the inflation .",
    "there is a distinct possibility that the inflationary regime was induced by the kinetic energy .",
    "the kinetic terms , of course , have to be of a nonstandard form , since for models with standard kinetic terms and without potential the universe is always decelerating .",
    "it is , however , possible to implement an inflationary evolution of the early universe if one assumes a nonstandard lagrangian .",
    "a novel way to generate an inflationary regime using the above approach , has been proposed in @xcite and dubbed `` _ @xmath1-inflation _ '' .",
    "the lagrangian in this model was taken in the form of expansion in orders of the standard kinetic term @xmath2 : @xmath3 the system described by the lagrangian of this form was shown to dynamically enter the inflationary regime starting from rather generic initial conditions .",
    "there is an analog of a `` slow - roll '' regime , where the systems has an adiabatically changing , nearly de sitter equation of state .",
    "the model possesses the energy - momentum tensor of the same structure as for the perfect fluid with the energy density @xmath4 and the pressure @xmath5 .",
    "therefore the hydro - dynamical intuition is useful for the analysis . at the end of _",
    "@xmath1-inflation _ the equation of state @xmath6 changes dynamically from @xmath7 to the `` _ ultra - hard _ '' equation of state @xmath8 .",
    "thus , exit from _",
    "@xmath1-inflation _ occurs in a natural graceful manner .    in this paper",
    "we propose a new model for inflation where the lagrangian depends only on the second derivatives of a scalar field .",
    "the simplest scalar that can be built from a scalar field @xmath9 and its second covariant derivatives is the dalembert operator acting on @xmath9 .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to this case .",
    "in fact , a large class of lagrangians of the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a convex function , will be shown to drive an inflationary evolution of the universe from rather generic initial conditions .",
    "this theory has to be viewed as an effective field theory where the first derivative terms are suppressed .",
    "one can , for example , suppose that in the lagrangian ( [ mukh ] ) the functions @xmath12 and @xmath13 vanish in some limiting cases .",
    "then the higher order derivative terms may dominate the dynamics of the system for some period of its evolution .",
    "the lagrangians of this type were also considered in @xcite in various contexts .",
    "we will dub this model analogously to _",
    "@xmath1-inflation _ as `` _ box - inflation _ '' or for simplicity `` _ b - inflation _ '' . the system described by this `` truncated '' lagrangian does not have an exit from inflation , so after discussing the properties of this system during the inflationary stage we propose simple modifications of the model which provide a graceful exit from _ b - inflation_. one natural way to implement this exit is to revive the kinetic terms which depend on @xmath9 and @xmath14 .",
    "for the proposed modifications , the system will generically exit to the state with @xmath15 .",
    "this is similar to the graceful exit in the case of chaotic inflation .",
    "the perturbation theory for the _ b - inflation _ as well as a detailed analysis of the observational consequences will be developed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we will first consider the action containing the dalembert operator @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 is the covariant derivative ) acting on a scalar field @xmath9 minimally coupled to gravity : @xmath18 .",
    "\\label{action0}\\ ] ] here @xmath19 is an arbitrary convex function ( @xmath20 , later we will see that this inequality is important ) .",
    "we will only consider the case when @xmath21 in order not to have the cosmological constant being inserted by hand .",
    "this underlines the fact that the inflationary regime in our model is a result of dynamics of the system .",
    "in addition it is natural to assume that the system is symmetric with respect to the @xmath22 transformations @xmath23 .",
    "thus we can take only even functions @xmath19 into consideration .",
    "the scale @xmath24 , at this point , is an arbitrary parameter . for the purposes of this paper",
    "its value is not very important .",
    "we will leave the question of the value of this scale for a future discussion .",
    "the `` strange '' choice of combination of masses for the @xmath19term is due to the following reason . writing the action @xmath25 as a taylor series in ( @xmath26 ) we find : @xmath27.\\ ] ]",
    "now we can see that the initial choice of combination of masses leads to a simple form of the first non - zero term in taylor expansion of action @xmath25 .",
    "let us mention that , in general , we will not rely on the expansion ( [ ts ] ) .",
    "there is another reason for choosing the combination @xmath28 in ( [ action0 ] ) .",
    "since the action is invariant under the `` shift '' symmetry @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is an arbitrary constant , the energy density is insensitive to the value of @xmath9 .",
    "it is , however , sensitive to the values of derivatives of @xmath9 .",
    "thus it is natural to make the @xmath31-operator dimensionless using one scale , whereas the value of the field @xmath9 is made dimensionless with some other scale .",
    "the scale @xmath24 can be viewed as the physical cutoff scale in our model .",
    "the other scale with which @xmath9 is made dimensionless we are free to choose at our convenience .",
    "we will choose this scale to be a planck scale . with this choice , it follows from the friedmann equation that the hubble parameter is naturally measured in units of @xmath24 .",
    "let us return to eq .",
    "( [ action0 ] ) and perform the following substitution : @xmath32 note that the space - time coordinates and the hubble parameter @xmath33 are made dimensionless with the same scale .",
    "the operator @xmath31 is also dimensionless in the new variables due to the relation @xmath34 .",
    "thus the action ( [ action0 ] ) can be written in terms of the new dimensionless variables as : @xmath35 .",
    "\\label{actionrescale1}\\ ] ] we will further use a different action : @xmath36 ,    \\label{actionrescale}\\ ] ] because the overall factor @xmath37 is irrelevant for the classical evolution .",
    "this form of action is useful for further numerical analysis , since everything is dimensionless . to recover physical values of the hubble parameter , energy density etc . from our numerical results",
    "one has to perform a straightforward inverse procedure @xmath38 where dots represent the rest of the physical parameters which are relevant for our model . in this paper",
    "we will work with the dimensionless variables defined in eq .",
    "( [ newvariables ] ) and action ( [ actionrescale ] ) keeping the same notations for them as we had for dimensionfull variables .",
    "this will be assumed in every expression unless specified otherwise .",
    "the equation of motion for the system described by the action ( [ actionrescale ] ) can be obtained by the variation of @xmath39 over @xmath9 : @xmath40 where @xmath41 means a derivative taken with respect to @xmath42 .",

    "as usual in inflationary cosmology , let us consider the cosmological evolution of the system for spatially flat friedmann universe with the metric @xmath46 the system of the equations of motion ( [ h1 ] ) can be written for this background in the following normal form @xmath47'\\dot b^2,\\nonumber\\\\ \\frac{db}{dt}&=&\\dot b,\\\\ \\frac{d\\dot \\phi}{dt}&=&-3h \\dot \\phi+b,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 .",
    "the first two equations integrate out to give @xmath49 in particular case of @xmath50 , the last expression yields that @xmath51 converges to some constant value @xmath52 which is not necessary equal to zero .",
    "it is precisely this peculiar fact that leads to inflation in the model under consideration . in this case",
    "the energy - momentum tensor ( [ met ] ) has a late time asymptotic of a @xmath53 term .",
    "namely it is @xmath54 .",
    "one can expect that for a convex function @xmath44 with the curvature @xmath55 restricted from below the asymptotic behavior is similar .",
    "below we will see that this guess is correct and will discuss the underlying reason for that .",
    "up to now the system under consideration is purely kinetic because neither equation of motion ( [ h1 ] ) nor the energy - momentum tensor ( [ met ] ) explicitly depend on @xmath9 .",
    "thus , in the case of the spatially flat friedmann universe , the only relevant dynamical variables are @xmath56 . in order to complete the description of the cosmological dynamics of this system we need the friedmann equation .",

    "we can note that the equations in our model are hyperbolic .",
    "therefore the cauchy problem is well posed .",
    "this means that the dependence of the solutions on the initial conditions is continuous and exponential instabilities are excluded .",
    "thus , possible classical instabilities , if any , are not as dramatic as it is for systems which may flip from hyperbolic type to elliptic type in the course of the dynamical evolution . if one includes the perturbations of the metric , the problem becomes even more involved and the further analysis is needed .",
    "finally , one may also worry about quantum instability due to the one graviton exchange between the ghost degree of freedom and the standard model particles . while during inflation the argument from @xcite is not applicable ,",
    "after the exit the residual ghost may pose such problem .",
    "there is no doubt , that weakly coupled ghost degree of freedom leads to the vacuum instability .",
    "however , if the ghost couples strongly to a regular scalar field in a particular way , which is the case in our model , the argument based on the evaluation of the creation rate of standard model particles out of vacuum is not reliable anymore .",
    "this issue certainly deserves further investigation .",
    "every realistic inflationary scenario needs to have a natural exit mechanism . in this part we will modify our model in order to have an exit from the inflationary regime",
    "let us return to the action ( [ action0 ] ) and add a first ",
    "order derivative term .",
    "it can be , for example , the first term from the lagrangian ( [ mukh ] ) .",
    "thus we shall consider the following action for the scalar field : @xmath180 .",
    "\\label{action00}\\ ] ] this choice has been widely discussed as an effective approach in string theory @xcite and its simplicity facilitates further analysis . in a cosmological context",
    "such a term was considered in @xcite .    to simplify the analysis of the system we again use the dimensionless variables defined according to ( [ newvariables ] ) .",
    "the overall factor @xmath37 is irrelevant for the classical analysis and we can use the following action instead : @xmath181 ,    \\label{action}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 depends on the dimensionless quantities @xmath182 and @xmath9 as usual @xmath183 .",
    "the implementation of the exit from the inflationary regime is based on the following idea .",
    "we assume that there are two regions of @xmath9 : one is a @xmath19-dominated region , where @xmath184 , so that the first term in ( [ action ] ) does not influence the dynamics ; and another is the region where the term @xmath185 influences the dynamics significantly in such a way that the system exits from the inflationary regime .",
    "we will call this region the @xmath186-region . starting from @xmath19-region , the system will enter the inflationary regime in a way very similar to that discussed in the previous section .",
    "then during inflation the value of @xmath9 is changing as @xmath187 ( where @xmath188 according to eq .",
    "( [ fixed ] ) ) , and the system may come eventually to the @xmath186-region .",
    "for example , if @xmath189 for @xmath190 and @xmath191 for @xmath192 , then starting from inflation in the region of large negative @xmath9 with @xmath193 , our system will eventually come to the @xmath186-region , where we expect the system to exit from the inflation . during the evolution ,",
    "the contribution to the action which comes from the @xmath194-term grows during the inflationary regime whereas the contribution from the @xmath19-term remains almost the same .",
    "therefore we can roughly estimate the time when inflation ends : @xmath195 where @xmath196 .",
    "the number of e - foldings during the inflationary regime is given by @xmath197 below we will find the necessary conditions on the function @xmath12 in order to have an exit from the inflationary regime , and will show that a large class of functions @xmath12 has the desired properties .    the energy density and the pressure coming from the additional term in the action @xmath198 give the following contribution to the energy density and the pressure of @xmath19-part of lagrangian ( eq .",
    "( [ ep ] ) ) : @xmath199 where subscript @xmath200 reflects the fact that the term under consideration contains no higher order derivatives .",

    "\\label{eom}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for simplicity we assume @xmath50 in the further analysis , since there is no qualitative difference between this choice and other convex functions @xmath44 . the equation of motion ( [ eom ] ) simplifies to @xmath202 these equations of motion have the structure similar to the usual klein - gordon equation .",
    "in particular the first term on the right hand side plays the role of a mass term for the field @xmath51 . using this analogy we come to the conclusion that in order to avoid a tachyonic instability we have to assume that @xmath203 .",
    "for the friedmann universe the system of equations ( [ eomb^2 ] ) takes the following form @xmath204 where we have introduced the effective mass @xmath205 .",
    "when the r.h.s .  of eq .",
    "( [ b_homog ] ) becomes large enough then inflation ends .",
    "the value of @xmath9 where the evolution changes significantly can be estimated by a comparison of the friction term in ( [ b_homog ] ) and the `` mass term '' , @xmath206 .",
    "when @xmath207 the field @xmath51 becomes massive and starts to oscillate and , thus , inflation ends .",
    "this is in fact quite similar to the exit from inflation in `` standard '' _ potential induced _ scenarios .    while the behavior of the system in the transition regime between the box - dominating phase and the oscillating phase is difficult to study analytically",
    ", it is possible to describe the system in the asymptotic oscillating regime .",
    "our further analysis is based on the book @xcite chapter 4 . introducing the rescaled fields @xmath208 , @xmath209 and the conformal time @xmath210 , we can rewrite the system ( [ b_homog]),([phi_homog ] ) in the following form : @xmath211 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath212 .",
    "the term on the right hand side in the first of these equations rapidly decays in the expanding friedmann universe .",
    "following the book @xcite we find that if @xmath213 the first term in the brackets can be neglected as well and the approximate solution corresponds to the frozen field @xmath214 .",
    "this is exactly the inflationary solution obtained in the previous section . in our problem",
    "the effective mass @xmath215 is growing with time , whereas the hubble constant changes only slightly . as the mass becomes larger than the hubble parameter @xmath216 we can neglect the second term inside the brackets in eq .",
    "( [ eofmconf ] ) .",
    "the wkb solution of the simplified equation written in terms of @xmath51 is then @xmath217.\\ ] ] this solution is valid in the case of a slowly varying mass @xmath218 , i.e. if @xmath219 going back from the conformal time units to a cosmic time the above inequality becomes @xmath220 since @xmath221 already , the first term in ( [ ineq ] ) is also much less then one . from the equation ( [ b_homog ] ) it follows that @xmath222.\\ ] ] estimating the energy density we obtain @xmath223 the neglected next - to - leading terms we have neglected are of the order of @xmath224 and are oscillating .",
    "since @xmath225 is a decreasing function of time and we average over fast oscillations these terms , indeed , quickly become subdominant .",
    "one can also estimate that the pressure behaves as @xmath226 .",
    "\\label{pressure}\\ ] ] after averaging over fast oscillations one obtains that @xmath227 .",
    "thus our system has a dust - like behavior after the inflation is over .",
    "now we are ready to formulate the conditions for @xmath12 in order to obtain the exit from inflation using the action ( [ action]):i ) @xmath203 ; ii ) there should exist the region of @xmath9 where @xmath228 ; iii ) eq .  ( [ hsimm ] ) must have a solution at some @xmath229 , where the value of @xmath33 is taken as it were in the inflationary regime .",
    "the last condition means , in particular , that for a function @xmath12 bounded below , the presence of the exit in the model depends on the value of @xmath51 ( and consequently on the value of @xmath230 ) during the inflation .",
    "below we study numerically two examples of the function @xmath12 to illustrate some generalities of the proposed exit mechanism .    the exit from the inflation which we have constructed still has to be complemented by a reheating mechanism , which would produce radiation after the end of inflation .",
    "since the residue component has a dust - like behavior after inflation ends , the mechanism which converts its energy into radiation is the same as in the standard inflationary scenarios : we need to couple the oscillating field ( in our case it can be @xmath51 instead of the inflaton field ) to some scalar fields @xmath231 through , for instance , an interaction term @xmath232 where @xmath51 and @xmath231 have dimension three and one respectively , and @xmath53 can be a planck or a somewhat lower scale . such an interacting term would lead to an energy density transfer from the massive `` field '' @xmath51 to the radiation - like particles _ via _ , for example , the narrow ( or broad ) parametric resonance .",
