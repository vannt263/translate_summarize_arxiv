    "the charged shower particles induce nitrogen fluorescence light , which is emitted isotropically mainly in the near uv - range of 300 - 400 nm @xcite . assuming the fluorescence yield is proportional to the energy deposit by a shower , as indicated by measurements @xcite , observing the emitted fluorescence light gives a measure of the local ionisation energy deposit and hence the shower size .    however , charged particles in extensive air showers ( eas ) are mostly relativistic and cherenkov light is produced as well .",
    "in contrast to the fluorescence light , cherenkov photons are emitted mostly in the forward direction .",
    "depending on the observation angle with respect to the shower axis , the intensity of produced cherenkov light contributes a non - negligible signal in fluorescence detectors @xcite , which can be of same order as the fluorescence light signal itself @xcite .",
    "thus , an efficient correction for or an explicit consideration of the cherenkov contribution to the measured signal is needed for the determination of the primary particle properties .    in the pioneering fly s eye experiment ,",

    "@xmath10 are the normalised angular distributions of produced cherenkov photons with respect to the shower axis . the photons are assumed to be produced at the shower axis , which is a good approximation for fluorescence technique applications since most charged particles are moving at a lateral distance of less than 60 m .",
    "the amount of so - called _ scattered cherenkov light _ reaching a detector depends mostly on the total number of photons produced since the dominant rayleigh scattering process is nearly isotropic .",
    "therefore , the integral @xmath11 , corresponding to integration of eq.([eq.chprod_allg ] ) over all angles @xmath4 , is the most important quantity and typically used to calculate the scattered cherenkov light contribution in fluorescence measurements .",

    "the energy dependent electron angular distribution with respect to the shower axis implies the angular distribution of resultant cherenkov photons produced in eas by convoluting in the cherenkov emission angle .",
    "this angle slightly changes with altitude and amounts about @xmath62 at sea level and decreases to about @xmath63 at 10 km above sea level .",
    "electrons undergo coulomb scattering and the higher the particle energy the smaller is the scattering angle .",
    "thus , the electron angular distribution is correlated with energy : the higher the mean electron energy , the smaller is the mean angle with respect to the shower axis .",
    "the electron angular distribution ( with respect to shower axis ) is shown for three different shower ages and various different ranges of electron energies .",
    "the electron angular distribution in high - energy showers is to a large extend independent of the shower age . ]    in fig.[fig.adel_age ] , the normalised electron angular distribution with respect to the shower axis ( averaged over azimuthal angle ) is shown exemplarily for an individual proton shower of @xmath42ev for three different shower ages , and various ranges of electron energies .",
    "the distributions do not change significantly with shower age within the statistical limitations .",
    "deviations increase with increasing angles to the shower axis , especially for higher electron energies of a few hundred mev and gev .",
    "however , at that energies and angles , fluctuations are also caused by low statistics due to the thinning applied . that the electron angular distributions is practically independent of shower age supports the electrons energy to be the determining factor of their angular distribution .",
    "charged particles are also deflected by the geomagnetic field . in the following we always average over the azimuthal angle and do not consider asymmetries implied by the geomagnetic field .",
    "although such effect has been discussed not to make a gross change @xcite , the effect seems not to be negligible , an approximate treatment of the effect is given in @xcite .",
    "at which extend the formulae given there describes the resulting azimuthal asymmetry sufficiently well would have to be investigated in detail separately .",
    "ev , @xmath42ev , @xmath64 ) . ]      as electron energy spectra in high - energy showers are universal and their scattering angle is mostly determined by the particle energy , the electron angular distribution should also be universal .    in fig.[fig.adel_uni ] , the electron angular distribution of many individual proton and iron showers is shown for a fixed shower age ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "for the mev - range , the distributions of individual showers ( of different primary energies and primary particle types ) do not differ much ; larger fluctuations occur only for large angles .",
    "the angular distribution of electrons in the gev - region shows a larger spread .",
    "this is in agreement with the universality studies of the energy spectrum , where larger shower - to - shower fluctuations also occur in the gev - range .    in conclusion , the spectral shape of the angular distribution of electrons in high - energy showers",
    "is mostly determined by the electron energy and almost independent of the shower age ( in the range considered of @xmath66 ) .",
    "it does not depend significantly either on primary energy or on primary particle type , see also @xcite .",
    "the angular distribution @xmath67 in eq.([eq.chprod ] ) is the angular distribution of cherenkov photons produced per angular bin with respect to the shower axis normalised to one photon ( averaged over azimuth ) : @xmath68 @xmath69 follows from the angular distribution of underlying electrons .",
    "thus , two dependencies follow for the angular distribution of produced cherenkov photons in eas :    * _ dependence on height _ the cherenkov emission angle is slightly changing with altitude , this dependence is , however , negligible as the electron angles are much larger .",
    "only electrons of energies above the cherenkov energy threshold @xmath29 are of interest , which implies that the higher @xmath29 the smaller is the mean angle of electrons emitting cherenkov light . finally , since the cherenkov energy threshold @xmath70 is - via the refractive index @xmath71 - a function of altitude , also the angular distribution of cherenkov photons depends on height .",
    "this dependence on @xmath29 can be approximated by an exponential function , see @xcite .",
    "+ * _ dependence on shower age _ since electron energy spectra develop with shower age , the part of electrons above the cherenkov threshold energy @xmath29 also changes with shower age .",
    "this is the reason why also the angular distribution of cherenkov photons depends on shower age .     and 1.2 .",
    "the monte carlo results are compared to predictions from @xcite and the new parameterisation , eq.([eq.adpara ] ) . ]    consequently , the photon angular distributions depend on both , the height due to the dependence of @xmath70 , and on the shower age because of the dependence of the electron energy spectrum @xmath44 .",
    "these dependencies of the angular distribution of produced cherenkov photons can be seen in fig.[fig.ad3heights ] . with decreasing height and increasing index of refraction , the photon number at larger angles to the shower axis increases , whereas it decreases at angles smaller than about @xmath72 ,",
    "see also fig.[fig.adcheck_p19th30 ] .      in principle , one could use the universal electron angular distribution ( finding a parameterisation in the mean electron energy or just use tabulated mean values ) for calculating the angular distribution of produced cherenkov photons . as it turns out",
    "it is also possible to find a closed analytical approximation for the complete integral .",
    "it is common to describe the height dependence of the angular distribution of produced cherenkov photons by an exponential function , where the scaling angle @xmath73 is a function of the cherenkov energy threshold , see e.g. @xcite : @xmath74 parameterisations of @xmath73 as a function of local cherenkov threshold energy @xmath70 have been calculated by several authors ; for example @xmath75 , with @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "traditionally this approximation is applied for calculating the cherenkov contamination of fluorescence light signals from high - energy showers , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "generalising this ansatz to take into account both effects , the dependence on refractive index as well as on the shower age we , write @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a polynomial of second order in shower age and the second , exponential term on the right depends on altitude only .",
    "the first accounts for so - called shower - to - shower fluctuations , namely the position of @xmath79 , and the latter includes the inhomogeneity of the medium , namely the refractive index changing with altitude .",

    "the simulated cherenkov photon angular distributions , which have been used to determine the coefficients of ( [ eq.adpara ] ) , although simulated with geomagnetic field , are averaged over azimuth . as shown in fig.[fig.adcheck_p19th30 ] , the corsika spectra are described properly by ansatz ( [ eq.adpara ] ) .",
    "the achieved quality of description by this ansatz is shown in fig.[fig.ad_sh2para_thin-8 ] . there , the relative differences with respect to individual corsika showers of very high statistics ( optimum thinning @xmath85 ) are shown . taking into account both the height and age dependence , also showers of different inclinations",
    "are described practically with the same accuracy of a few percent .",
    "in fluorescence observations , one measures the fluorescence light profile , and the number of produced fluorescence photons in a shower is proportional to the local ionisation energy deposit d@xmath86 : @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the fluorescence yield in air at altitude @xmath20 .",
    "thus , light profiles measured using the fluorescence technique are measurements of the energy deposit by the shower rather than its shower size .",
    "the advantage of using d@xmath86 over shower size is not only that d@xmath86 is most closely connected to the measured fluorescence light but also solves the problem of the ambiguity in the definition of shower size in simulations as pointed out in sec.[sec.ed ] .",
    "furthermore , it can be conveniently simulated @xcite .",
    "in addition , energy deposit profiles can be simulated with rather large low - energy thresholds @xmath89mev , and therefore is much less cpu consuming .    for analytical description of the cherenkov contribution to fluorescence profiles , it is hence very useful to allow the calculation additionally as a function of d@xmath86 , although the shower size is the physics quantity that is more closely related to cherenkov production .",
    "we define the mean ionisation loss rate @xmath90 by @xmath91 where @xmath41 is a low - energy threshold , which has to be applied in the case of shower simulations as discussed in sec.[sec.ed ] .",

    "both have been shown to be independent of different primary energy and particle type to a good approximation .",
    "a parameterisation of the energy spectrum in shower age has been introduced , which describes showers independently of different primary energy , particle type and zenith angle at high accuracy of a few percent ( within shower - to - shower fluctuations ) for the electron energy range from 1mev to a few gev , covering also the range most important for cherenkov light emission .",
    "the electron angular distribution is mostly dominated by the particle energy and do not depend significantly on the shower age for a fixed energy . as a consequence",
    ", the angular distribution of produced cherenkov photons has been parameterised as a function of height and shower age .",
    "the age dependence follows from the electron energy spectra .",
    "the dependence on height is due to the change of the cherenkov threshold energy with altitude .",
    "based on these universality features of high - energy showers , an analytical description of the cherenkov light production in eas has been presented providing both , the total number of produced cherenkov photons as well as their angular distribution with respect to the shower axis .",
    "it offers the calculation of the direct and scattered cherenkov contribution to measured fluorescence light profiles , see @xcite .",
    "the advantage of using energy deposit rather than the number of charged particles in the simulation and reconstruction of light profiles measured with the fluorescence technique has been pointed out .",
    "having introduced a parameterisation of the mean energy deposit @xmath99 , the scattered and direct cherenkov light contributions to light profiles measured in fluorescence observations can be estimated either as a function of shower size or energy deposit profiles with an accuracy of a few percent .",
    "the geomagnetic effect leading to azimuthal asymmetries in electron and cherenkov photon angular distributions seems not to be negligible and needs to be studied in more detail separately .",
    "we thank our colleagues of the auger collaboration for many fruitful discussions .",
    "particularly , the support of d. heck in performing the simulations and sharing his deep insight in corsika is gratefully acknowledged .",
