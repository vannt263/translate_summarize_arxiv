    "many of the gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglows can be explained as the synchrotron emission from the shock produced by the interaction of the ejecta with the circumburst medium ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) , and their spectra and light curves have helped us understand the total energy scale , the outflow structure , and the circumburst medium profile as well as the microphysical conditions of the relativistic collisionless shock for each afterglow ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "major problems on the physics of the relativistic collisionless shocks involve how to accelerate particles into the population with the power - law energy distribution @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the electron lorentz factor , and how to amplify the magnetic field from the typical strength in the interstellar medium @xmath5 g to the strength required to produce bright synchrotron radiation @xmath6 g for grb afterglows .",
    "polarimetric observations of synchrotron radiation from the relativistic shocks can reveal the magnetic field structure .",
    "the field structure is essential for constraining the mechanisms of field amplification and particle acceleration ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the extensive polarimetric observations of the late - time optical afterglows ( @xmath7day ) have been performed @xcite , as the time after the burst trigger . ]",
    "although the field structure is still in debate ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "early polarimetric observation is crucial .",
    "polarimetric observation generally needs large amount of photons and therefore needs a larger telescope than typical imaging , because the required accuracy is mostly of @xmath8% order . to obtain polarimetric data of early afterglow of grbs",
    ", we should have a polarimeter of which the field of view is larger than the initial position error of grbs ( @xmath9 ) as well as a quickly moving telescope .",
    "since the early emission of grbs changes rapidly , the polarimeter should also have a function to obtain all stokes parameters for linear polarization , @xmath10 and @xmath11 within a short timescale .",
    "recently , optical polarimetry has been performed at the early phase .",
    "@xcite reported an upper limit on the polarization degree of grb 060218 as @xmath12 at @xmath13 203  s , corresponding to the onset phase of the forward shock .",
    "@xcite detected an optical polarization of @xmath14 at @xmath13 161  s _ in the reverse shock emission _ of grb  090102 .",
    "both grbs were observed by ringo attached to the 2.0  m robotic liverpool telescope , which uses a rotating polarizer .    in this letter , we report the first detection of the early forward shock optical polarization for grb  091208b with the kanata 1.5  m telescope at higashi - hiroshima observatory . the optical emission is explained as the forward shock synchrotron emission , and the polarization degree is @xmath1 averaged over @xmath15@xmath16s .",
    "the polarization of the forward shock emission provides us with the information on the structure of the magnetic field amplified from the weak circumburst magnetic field , rather than possible magnetic fields advected from the central engine which may be probed with the polarization from the reverse shock @xcite .",
    "it also might be interesting to compare our data for the optical afterglow with the recent claim of detection of @xmath4-ray polarization @xmath17 in the prompt emission of grb  100826a @xcite .",
    "the prompt emission of grb  091208b has the duration @xmath18s , and the fluence in the @xmath19@xmath20kev band @xmath21 .",
    "the redshift is determined as @xmath22 , so that the isotropic @xmath4-ray energy is estimated as @xmath23erg @xcite .",
    "we performed optical imaging polarimetry of grb  091208b with howpol ( hiroshima one - shot wide - field polarimeter ; @xcite ) attached to the nasmyth focus on 1.5-m kanata telescope at higashi - hiroshima observatory , japan .",
    "since howpol uses a wedged double wollaston prism @xcite at the pupil image position after the collimator lens , four images by linearly polarized rays at 0@xmath24 , 90@xmath24 , 45@xmath24 and 135@xmath24 position angles ( pas ) , respectively , are recorded on two 2k4k hpk ccds simultaneously .",
    "this enables us to obtain all three stokes parameters for linear polarization , i.e. , @xmath25 , from only a single exposure .",
    "our observation started at 2009 dec 8.41142 ut , @xmath26149  s , which was automatically processed after receiving the _ swift_/bat notice via gcn .",
    "this is one of the earliest polarimetry to date , as far as we know .",
    "we took ten 30  s exposures and then nine 60  s exposures through a @xmath27 aperture mask and an @xmath28-band filter .",
    "the observation finished at dec 8.42458 , @xmath261286  s. figure  [ fig : img091208b ] shows a sample image of grb  091208b obtained with howpol .",
    "the raw data were reduced in a standard way for ccd aperture photometry . for the photometric calibration",
    ", we used @xmath29 magnitudes of three nearby stars ( c1c3 : usno b 1068 - 0020023 , 1068 - 0020019 , and 1069 - 0020340 ) . the optical light curve can be described with a single power - law form ( decay index @xmath30 ) , as shown in figure  [ fig : lc091208b ] . for polarimetry , we could not use the sixth exposure ( centered at @xmath26376  s ) and all exposures after 13th ( @xmath26791  s ) because one polarization image of the grb out of four falls into the gap of the two ccds due to slight telescope guiding error .",
    "it reduces the number of the available frames for polarimetry to 11 . as for polarimetric calibration",
    ", we corrected for the instrumental polarization of @xmath31  % , predominantly caused by the @xmath32-incidence reflection on the tertially mirror of the telescope .",
    "the instrumental polarization has been modeled with an accuracy of @xmath33 % as a function of the hour angle and the declination ( and also of the position taken in the field of view ) of the object by systematic observations for unpolarized standard stars , and then checked by observations for strongly - polarized standard stars . in the case of grb 091208b , it changed gradually with time from @xmath34 % to @xmath35 % and @xmath36 % to @xmath37 % over the 11 exposures .",
    "the detailed procedure and reliability of this ` one - shot polarimetry ' will appear in a forthcoming paper ( k. s. kawabata et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .    since the s / n ratio of each single exposure is not sufficient for polarimetry ( @xmath38 % ) , we combined the all 11 @xmath39 and @xmath11 parameters to enhance the reliability .",
    "we performed a traditional , statistic correction for the polarization bias in cases of low s / n as @xmath40 ( @xcite , see also @xcite ) .",
    "the derived polarization is @xmath41%  and @xmath42 % ( i.e. , @xmath43 %  and pa=@xmath44 ) .",
    "the galactic interstellar extinction indicates that the interstellar polarization toward this grb is negligibly small ( @xmath45 % ; @xcite ) . to check the consistency",
    ", we obtained the polarization of nearby stars ( @xmath46 ) brighter than or comparably faint to the grb a fterglow taken in the same frames , and plot them in @xmath47-diagram ( figure  [ fig : nearbypol ] ) . assumed that they are mostly galactic normal stars having little or no intrinsic polarization , the diagram would support that the grb afterglow has a significant polarization .",
    "we reduced the public data of xrt on _ swift _ for grb  091208b , using the xrt pipeline ftool _ xrtpipeline _ ( version :  2.3.3 ) .",
    "the obtained 0.310 kev light curve is shown in figure  [ fig : lc091208b ] .",
    "the first orbit data at @xmath48@xmath49s exhibit possible bumps and mini - flares ( cf .",
    "the following orbit data can be described with a broken power - law form ; @xmath50 and , @xmath51 .",
    "we obtained the decay indices and the break time as listed in table  [ tab : grb091208b_x ] .",
    "based on the variability in the light curve , we defined three phases for grb  091208b , as described in table  [ tab : grb091208b_x ] .",
    "for each phase , we obtained the time - averaged spectrum at 0.38.0 kev .",
    "we fitted a power - law model having two absorption components to the x - ray data .",
    "one component is the absorption in our galaxy and the other is the host galaxy . for the former , the galactic hydrogen column density has been derived as @xmath52 for the direction of grb 091208b @xcite and we fixed it . for the latter , we confirmed that the column density in the host galaxy @xmath53 is practically constant by our trial fitting and put @xmath53 as a common parameter for all three phases .",
    "we show the result of our fitting in table  [ tab : grb091208b_x ] .",
    "@xmath53 is derived as @xmath54 @xmath55 .",
    "it is noted that the spectral index @xmath56 does not significantly change through the period of our optical polarimetry .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sed ] , we show the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from optical ( @xmath57  hz ) to x - ray band ( @xmath58  hz ) at @xmath59@xmath60  s. the galactic extinction of @xmath61 @xcite has been corrected for using a standard way . on the other hand , for the extinction within the host galaxy , we adopted three extinction curve models , the milky way ( mw ) , the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , and the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) models , while the hydrogen column density ( @xmath62 @xmath55 ) is fixed @xcite .",
    "using one of these three models , we corrected the extinction in the optical bands .",
    "the extinction for the smc model ( or less than that ) seems reasonable , since the temporal decay of the optical flux implies a soft spectrum in the synchrotron model . in this case , the flux density is 1.4 @xmath63 0.3  mjy at 3.9@xmath64  hz .",
    "the observed optical afterglow has a typical power - law light curve that is explained by the synchrotron emission from the forward shock propagating in the external medium @xcite .",
    "the decay index @xmath30 is very likely to be the case @xmath65 with the uniform - density external medium and @xmath66 , where @xmath67hz , @xmath68 is the minimum injection frequency , @xmath69 is the cooling frequency , and @xmath70 is the index of the electron energy distribution ( see table 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "the x - ray emission in the second phase also looks a typical power - law light curve , although we find that the above model for the optical emission can not explain the x - ray emission simultaneously , as shown below .",
    "the x - ray emission in the second phase shows @xmath71 .",
    "this can be interpreted as the case @xmath72 with @xmath73 .",
    "thus one may consider the case @xmath74 in this phase . at some time earlier , @xmath75 may have passed across @xmath76 , which means that the x - ray light curve can have a break and the decay index before the break is the same as @xmath77 .",
    "this enables us to have an x - ray light curve that is not brighter than the observed x - ray emission in the first phase . in this case , however , the optical and x - ray synchrotron emissions are in the same spectral segment , i.e. , @xmath78 with @xmath79 , which is not compatible with the observed joint spectrum in figure  [ fig : sed ] , in which the blue line has the spectral index @xmath80 .",
    "the extrapolation of the optical flux at the higher frequencies with such a value of @xmath81 overwhelms the observed x - ray flux .    considering that the observed x - rays at the first phase shows several flares",
    ", it is reasonable that the optical emission is the forward shock synchrotron radiation with @xmath65 , whereas the x - ray emission has different origins .",
    "many models have been proposed for such anomalous x - ray afterglows ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this case",
    ", the extrapolation of the optical flux at the higher frequencies has to have a cooling break at @xmath82hz to suppress the emission below the observed x - rays .",
    "the other necessary conditions for this model are the following : @xmath83 and @xmath84 to have a single power - law light curve at the optical band ; and @xmath85mjy .",
    "the condition for @xmath69 can be summarized by using @xmath86 as @xmath87 .",
    "the characteristic quantities in the forward shock synchrotron model with the uniform - density external medium are given by @xcite @xmath88 where @xmath89erg is the total isotropic energy of the blast wave , which may be comparable to @xmath23erg ( see section  [ sec : intro ] ) , @xmath90 is the density of the external medium , and @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the fractions of the shocked energy carried by the electrons and the magnetic field , respectively .",
    "the case of @xmath66 involves the factor @xmath93 , where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the maximum and minimum injection lorentz factors of electrons , respectively , and @xmath96 typically has a value of @xmath97",
    ". the optical emission is calculated as @xmath98 .",
    "the necessary conditions given above are translated into @xmath99 where we define a numerical factor @xmath100 .",
    "the equations are reduced into @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 .",
    "these equations indicate that the optical emission can be understood as the forward shock synchrotron emission with the typical parameter values @xcite .",
    "we have measured the optical polarization in the early forward shock emission of this burst as @xmath1 . since this is a mean value over a long observation time @xmath0s",
    ", the actual polarization degree might have been either unusually constant or temporally much higher .",
    "this result disfavors the afterglow model in which the magnetic field coherent scales are plasma skin depths in the emission region , as explained below .",
    "the magnetic field can be amplified by the plasma instabilities at the shock front , such as weibel instability .",
    "this can produce the strong fields with random directions on the skin depth scales , which are very tiny compared with the size of the observable region of the shock @xcite .",
    "the field directions are possibly constrained to be parallel to the shock plane . in this case , however , the observed polarization reaches a maximum value around the jet break time ( typically around @xmath7day ) in general @xcite .",
    "our measurement of the early optical polarization which is higher than the typical late - time polarization , @xmath104@xmath105%  ( at @xmath7day ; @xcite ) is thus not consistent with this mechanism.s from the power - law model are all within the @xmath106 level . ] some polarization angle data at late - time are also incompatible with this mechanism @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the numerical simulations of collisionless shocks suggest that the fields produced by the plasma instabilities decay fast and do not survive on the large scales corresponding to the emission region @xcite .",
    "we suggest that magnetohydrodynamic instabilities may be viable for the magnetic field origin in the emission region , rather than the plasma instabilities . if the shock sweeps inhomogeneous external medium , multiple vorticities arise downstream of the shock due to the growth of the richtmyer - meshkov instability , increasing the field strength @xcite .",
    "the numerical simulations show that this mechanism can produce strong fields random on large scales that are roughly comparable to the density fluctuation scale of the external medium .",
    "such large - scale fields decay rather slowly , which may survive in the entire emission region . in this case",
    "the observed polarization scales as @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the number of the coherent field patches in the observable region @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "our measured polarization degree means @xmath110 . since the radius @xmath28 and the lorentz factor @xmath111 of the forward shock",
    "are estimated to be @xmath112 cm , and @xmath113 @xcite , we may estimate the typical scale of the field coherent patch at @xmath114s as @xmath115 cm .",
    "the coherent patches with such scales might be formed by the density fluctuations of molecular cloud cores or hi clouds in the interstellar medium , of which the sizes are typically @xmath116 cm .    in this model ,",
    "the polarization angle randomly changes with time , and the polarization degree scales as @xmath117 at @xmath7day , this burst may show @xmath118 , if @xmath119 is roughly constant through the shock propagation .",
    "this value is comparable to ( or somewhat smaller than ) the typical late - time polarization , @xmath120 . if the shock propagates in the magnetized wind from the progenitor star , the polarization from the ordered field , which has roughly constant degree and angle , contributes to the net polarization @xcite , although the light curve of this burst implies that the density profile of the external medium is constant ( @xmath121 ) rather than the wind type ( @xmath122 ) ( see section  [ sec : model ] ) .",
    "the result of @xcite , a @xmath123 upper - limit @xmath124% for grb  060418 , might imply that @xmath119 was several times smaller than that for the grb 091208b case .",
    "anyway , we need more data of polarization and also their time variation for other bursts , which would further constrain the field structure in the emission region and the nature of the environment of grbs .    this work is supported by jsps research fellowships for young scientists ( tu , kt , ri , ms , and my ) and by the grant - in - aid for scientific research from jsps ( 17684004 , 19047003 , 23244030 , 23340048 , and 60372702 ) .",
