    "submillimeter observations of deeply embedded star - forming regions have identified a small number of strong sources that have virtually no emission at wavelengths below 10  @xmath4 m and whose spectral energy distributions are characterized by single blackbodies at @xmath5 k. these cold `` class 0 '' sources are good candidates for protostars whose circumstellar envelope masses exceed that of their central protostars ( andr , ward - thompson , & barsony 1993 , andr & montmerle 1994 , andr 1995 ) , in which case their ages may be as low as @xmath6 yrs ( barsony 1994 ) .",
    "sources in this class are also defined by the presence of energetic bipolar outflows .",
    "there is now good evidence that a large fraction of young stellar objects have dense , dusty accretion disks ( eg .",
    "beckwith et al .",
    "1990 , lada 1991 ) .",
    "this is in accord with standard collapse models of star formation ( eg .",
    "terebey , shu , & cassen 1984 ) , which predict that systems older than @xmath7 years have centrifugally supported disks extending to 100  au .",
    "disks around the sources l1551 irs5 and hl tau have been resolved with semi - major axes of 80 and 60 au , respectively ( lay et al .",
    "1994 , mundy et al .",
    "even larger magnetically supported `` pseudo '' disks extending out to 1000 au are predicted for some magneto - hydrodynamic collapse models ( galli & shu 1993 , fiedler & mouschovias 1993 ) .",
    "most current models of outflow posit the existence of disks as an essential element of the engine ( eg .",
    "pudritz , pelletier , & gomez de castro 1991 , konigl & ruden 1993 , shu et al .",
    "if the class 0 sources are young , then the terebey et al .",
    "( 1984 ) models suggest that a disk with radius of 100 au at @xmath8 yrs has a centrifugal radius of only @xmath9 au at @xmath6 yrs . similarly a larger magnetically supported outer region of @xmath10  au ( galli & shu 1993 )",
    "should be present at these early times if 1000 au structures exist at @xmath8 yrs .",
    "such small , centrifugally supported regions would still be able to drive outflows , while the larger magnetic structure could play an important role in star formation itself .",
    "letter _ describes the results of our search for an accretion disk in the prototype class 0 source , vla 1623 , using the jcmt - cso submillimeter interferometer .",
    "observations of vla 1623 were obtained with the jcmt - cso interferometer on 7 april 1995 at a frequency of 356 ghz with 500 mhz bandwidth and 9 april 1995 at 353 ghz with 1 ghz bandwidth .",
    "the projected length of the baseline ranged from 140 to 190 k@xmath11 and observations were obtained over a period of two to three hours each night .",
    "the quasar nrao 530 was used to monitor the gain of the instrument and the absolute uncertainty in the flux calibration is 20% .",
    "the average gain of the instrument was 70 jy k@xmath12 and the system temperature was 800 k. the data were obtained with 10 s integrations and vector - averaged over 100 s intervals . since the phase response of the interferometer over longer periods of time is not yet known , only the amplitude of the visibility function was used in the analysis .",
    "observations were also obtained at a frequency of 220 ghz with 1 ghz bandwidth on 10 april 1995 over a period of 7 hours .",
    "the projected length of the baseline ranged from 60 to 120  k@xmath11 and the system temperature was 400 k.    the visibility flux of vla 1623 shows no dependence on the projected baseline length ( figure  [ fig-1]a , b ) and thus the source is unresolved .",
    "we measured both the flux and an upper limit to the full - width half - maximum radius of the source using the techniques outlined in lay et al .",
    "briefly , we fit a two - dimensional gaussian to the data using the rice distribution to describe the noise .",
    "the position angle was fixed at @xmath13 to orient the disk perpendicular to the large - scale outflow ( andr et al .",
    "fifty simulated data sets were then generated by adding artificial noise to the best fitting model .",
    "the best fit parameters ( flux and major - axis radius ) derived from these simulated data sets are shown in figure  [ fig-1]d , from which 90% confidence limits can be determined . at 355 ghz , the flux is @xmath14 jy and the major - axis radius is @xmath15 au ( for a distance to @xmath16 oph of 160 pc ) .",
    "fitting the data with a circularly symmetric gaussian produces a somewhat smaller upper limit to the radius of 45 au .",
    "a more physically valid model would be a power - law disk ( see  3 ) . the large uncertainty in the flux at 355 ghz is due to the rather limited baseline coverage obtained for this low declination source .",
    "as a result , the model fits are unable to distinguish between a weaker compact source and a stronger , more extended source for which some of the flux is resolved out even on the shortest baselines at 355 ghz ( figure  [ fig-1 ] ) . at 220 ghz ,",
    "the flux is @xmath17 jy and the radius is @xmath18 au .",
    "we calculated the expected contribution to the visibility flux from the extended envelope as in lay et al .",
    "we modeled the envelope of vla 1623 as an optically thin sphere with @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the flux scale was calibrated using single dish fluxes from andr et al .",
    "we also assumed that the envelope stops where the disk begins and so adopted an inner cutoff radius for the envelope of 70 au . under these conditions ,",
    "the envelope for the 70 au model contributes negligible flux at 355 ghz and only 0.03 jy at 220 ghz .",
    "thus , we attribute most of the observed flux to the presence of an unresolved disk in vla 1623 .",
    "our observations provide useful constraints on plausible accretion disk models for the origin of the submillimeter emission .",
    "we adopt the approach of beckwith et al .",
    "( 1990 ) and assume a geometrically thin disk with power law scalings with radius of the disk temperature and surface density , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the dust temperature and mass surface density at the inner radius @xmath25 of the dust distribution .",
    "the optical depth is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the inclination of the disk axis to the line of sight and @xmath28 is the specific dust opacity .",
    "the flux emitted by the disk is then @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the planck function , @xmath31 is the distance to the source , and @xmath32 is the outer disk cutoff radius .",
    "power - law fits to disks around hl tau and l1551 irs5 produce cutoff radii up to a factor of 2.5 larger than radii from gaussian fits ( lay et al .",
    "1994 , mundy et al .",
    "however , since vla 1623 is unresolved , there is no structure in the visibility data to constrain a power law and so such a fit was not performed on this data set .    while @xmath33 for purely viscous accretion disk models , more general calculations which incorporate the effects of reprocessing and disk flaring typically find @xmath34 . noting that various model fits have @xmath35 ( eg .",
    "thamm , steinacker , & henning , 1994 ) , we adopt ranges of @xmath36 and @xmath37",
    ". the maximum dust temperature must be less than its sublimation temperature , @xmath38 k. the inner edge of the disk can not be inside the stellar photosphere , which for low mass stars gives @xmath39 r@xmath40 au .",
    "we take the inclination angle of the disk to be that of the outflow from vla 1623 , @xmath41 or almost edge - on ( andr et al . 1990 ) .",
    "the spectrum @xmath42 determined from our measured fluxes at 355 and 220 ghz has @xmath43 , where optically thin models have @xmath44 and optically thick models have @xmath45 .",
    "recent calculations show that @xmath46 at wavelengths from 650 @xmath4 m to 2.7 mm for submicron to millimeter sized particles and a wide variety of densities and temperatures ( pollack et al .",
    "finally , the parameter space characterizing the emission is also constrained by our observed flux , our upper limit to the cutoff radius of @xmath47 au , and by the @xmath48 l@xmath49 bolometric luminosity of the entire source ( andr et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "it is obvious that this accretion disk model covers a large parameter space that is relatively poorly constrained .",
    "the issue of the uniqueness of model fits has been addressed by thamm et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and bouvier & bertout ( 1992 ) , who find `` global ambiguity '' in acceptable fits to models of t tauri disks based on spectral energy distributions that incorporate far more infrared data than is available for vla1623 .",
    "however , for the limiting cases of completely optically thick or thin truncated disks in the rayleigh - jeans limit , the cutoff radius can be related to the observed flux @xmath50 by @xmath51^{1/\\gamma } \\eqno(1)\\ ] ] where @xmath52 can be computed from the observations .",
    "for the optically thick case , the parameters are @xmath53 and @xmath54 , while for the optically thin case , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , where @xmath57 .",
    "equation ( 1 ) shows that we can simplify our analysis of the model by reducing the six free parameters ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath23 , @xmath25 , @xmath24 ) to essentially the two parameters @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( with @xmath32 measured in units of @xmath25 ) .",
    "then a disk model characterized by a given index @xmath61 produces a unique curve in the @xmath63 plane .",
    "these curves are plotted in figure  [ fig-2 ] for vla 1623 , for which @xmath64 jy gives @xmath65  k  au@xmath66 .",
    "in addition , our observed flux and upper limit to the cutoff radius restrict possible disk models to lie within the region demarcated by the three dashed lines in figure  [ fig-2 ] .",
    "boundary line ( a ) is the @xmath67 model ( i.e. @xmath68 or @xmath69 for optically thick or thin cases ) , which demarcates a model disk with uniform surface brightness and therefore the smallest cutoff radius @xmath32 for the emitted flux . line ( b ) is our upper limit to the cutoff radius @xmath70 au coupled with the condition that @xmath71  au , while line ( c ) is the upper limit to @xmath72 for a given @xmath62 .",
    "line ( c ) arises from the fact that @xmath23 must be less than @xmath73 , so that @xmath25 must be greater than @xmath74 , and thus @xmath75 au implies @xmath76 .",
    "figure  [ fig-2 ] shows that while optically thick models with values of @xmath77 fill the largest portion of the permitted parameter space , models with @xmath59 up to 0.75 are also acceptable .",
    "optically thin models fill a much smaller portion of parameter space , with low values of @xmath78 being less likely . in general",
    ", the optically thin solutions have relatively large values for the inner radius , which suggests that they may also have a small optically thick region that contributes relatively little to the total flux of the source .",
    "the observed bolometric luminosity of the envelope+disk system also provides a constraint on the cutoff radius . for @xmath79 ,",
    "the luminosity of an optically thick disk is given by @xmath80 , while for @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "for @xmath83 , this expression can be combined with equation ( 1 ) to give @xmath84 in addition , equation ( 1 ) can be rewritten as @xmath85 , which allows the straightforward calculation of @xmath86 for a given @xmath32 obtained from equation ( 2 ) . for @xmath87 and @xmath88 l@xmath49 ,",
    "the cutoff radius is @xmath89 au and the inner disk temperature is @xmath90 k , while for @xmath91 and @xmath92 au , the radius is @xmath9369 au and the temperature is @xmath94 k. for @xmath95 the expression for @xmath32 is different from equation ( 2 ) and depends on the value of @xmath25 . for @xmath81 and @xmath96 au ,",
    "the cutoff radius is @xmath9390 - 85 au , while for @xmath97 the radius is @xmath93230 - 120 au .",
    "a smaller but warmer optically thin disk could probably also produce the observed 355 ghz flux and bolometric luminosity , but the numerical models required to derive the exact cutoff radius in this case are beyond the scope of this paper .    thus both the spectral index and the models summarized in figure  [ fig-2 ] are consistent with either optically thin or optically thick disks with a cutoff radius not exceeding 175 au .",
    "we obtain a lower limit to the disk mass from the measured 220 ghz flux by taking the optically thin limit , @xmath98   ( r_d / r_o)^q \\eqno(3)\\ ] ] assuming a cutoff radius @xmath99 au , an inner radius @xmath100 au , an opacity @xmath101 cm@xmath66 gm@xmath12 at 220 ghz ( @xmath103 ) , a maximum temperature of @xmath104 k , and @xmath105 gives a minimum disk mass @xmath106 m@xmath107 ; the true disk mass could be much higher .",
    "the constraints on the size of the central source have implications for theoretical models of the evolution of sources such as vla 1623 .",
    "we adopt an effective sound speed @xmath108 km s@xmath12 for this innermost region of vla 1623 ( andr et al .",
    "1993 ) and a magnetic field strength @xmath109 g appropriate for low mass molecular cloud cores ( myers & goodman 1988 ) . in the context of the galli & shu ( 1993 ) model , the magnetic support radius of the disk",
    "is given by @xmath110 where @xmath111 is in units of @xmath112 yrs and @xmath113 is the gravitational constant .",
    "if we identify the upper limit to the cutoff radius of 175 au with the radius of the pseudo - disk , @xmath114 , then this model predicts an age for the system of @xmath115  yr .",
    "this age agrees with general estimates for class 0 ages ( barsony 1994 ) , but is somewhat longer than initial estimates for the age of vla 1623 ( andr et al .",

    "( 1993 ) map . in the context of the sis model",
    ", this age suggests that the envelope and the collapsed protostellar core+disk will each contain comparable amounts of material .",
    "alternatively , if we identify 175 au with the centrifugal balance radius , @xmath117 au , then the age of the system is @xmath118 yr , similar to age estimates for class i sources ( wilking , lada , & young 1989 ) . in this picture ,",
    "the magnetic pseudo - disk , if present , would extend to 2300 au , and must have a very low column density in order to be undetectable with lower resolution measurements ( e.g. andr et al .",
    "this age is five times longer than the time required for the expansion wave to reach the edge of the circumstellar envelope . over this time",
    ", a compressional wave propagating inwards from the envelope edge would have accelerated the collapse of the remaining envelope material onto the stellar core .",
    "returning to the assumption that most of the compact core is magnetically supported , the centrifugal balance radius in the pseudo - disk then occurs at @xmath119 au .",
    "this region is large enough either to drive off a disk wind or to interact with a possible stellar magnetosphere , and thus theoretical models developed to explain outflows in class i sources are likely to be equally valid for class 0 sources .",

    "a possible reason for the inconsistency in the mass accretion rates is that sis models have constant infall rates .",
    "more general models of molecular cloud cores ( eg .",
    "mclaughlin & pudritz 1996 , 1997 , foster & chevalier 1993 ) do not collapse at a constant accretion rate , which may alleviate this problem .    finally , we note that the outflow in vla 1623 has reached much larger scales ( @xmath126 au , andr et al .",
    "1990 ) than the expansion wave predicted by the sis model .",
    "this situation is possible because outflows are likely to be super - alfvnic .",
