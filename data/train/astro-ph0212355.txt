    "in a recent paper @xcite , we discuss a variety of predictions for galaxy - ly@xmath0 forest correlations from hydrodynamic simulations . in this proceeding",
    ", we focus on the `` galaxy proximity '' effect on small scales ( @xmath5 mpc comoving ) . using smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations ( sph ) of a @xmath6cdm universe ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 )",
    ", we generate synthetic ly@xmath0 forest spectra from the temperature , gas density , and velocity at each spatial location in skewers through the simulation box .",
    "once we have created synthetic spectra , we use the known positions of the simulated galaxies to compute the mean flux decrement , @xmath9 , as a function of comoving separation from the galaxy , @xmath10 .",
    "figure 1a shows the basic predictions for the mean flux decrement , computed for the 150 galaxies with the highest star formation rates within a simulation @xmath11 mpc on a side .",
    "we see a clear trend of increasing decrement ( absorption ) with decreasing @xmath10 , a signature of the dense environments these galaxies occupy .",
    "the observed points , from @xcite , show a similar trend at large scales , but the trend flattens at @xmath12 mpc , and absorption _ decreases _ for @xmath1 mpc .",
    "the innermost point , @xmath13 mpc is in especially severe conflict with the theoretical prediction .",
    "we investigate several possibilities for resolving this conflict below .",
    "similar investigations have been carried out by @xcite , @xcite , and our results are compatible with theirs to the extent that they overlap .",
    "mpc as a function of @xmath14 .",
    "vertical lines at @xmath15 and @xmath16 correspond to the adelberger et al .",
    "@xcite value for this separation and the global mean respectively .",
    "symbols are as indicated in the panel . ]",
    "since we expect galaxies to occupy peaks in the density distribution , if the redshift of the galaxy is incorrectly estimated , then one may compute an artificially low value of @xmath14 at small @xmath10 because one samples a region of lower density than the region around the true galaxy redshift .",
    "we estimate the size of this effect by adding a redshift error , drawn from a gaussian distribution , to each galaxy redshift .",
    "squares and pentagons in figure 1a show the result for rms redshift errors @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the sign of the effect is as expected  increasing the redshift errors does decrease the values of @xmath14 at small @xmath10 , pushing them towards the global mean .",
    "it is clear , however , that even with significant redshift errors ( adelberger et al .",
    "estimate @xmath19 ) the difference between the theoretical curves and the observations remains substantial .",
    "there is some evidence that a significant amount of lyman continuum radiation is leaking from the interstellar media of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) @xcite .",
    "it is then plausible that these galaxies may affect their immediate surroundings in the form of photoionization from the stars within them .",
    "there is also evidence indicating that @xmath20 of lbgs host agn @xcite .",
    "if the timescale between agn outbursts is sufficiently short , then , in contrast to the stellar case , the gas surrounding the galaxies can remain out of photoionization equilibrium between outbursts , and the neutral hydrogen fractions around galaxies that have recently hosted agn may be further suppressed .",
    "we have incorporated simple models for these two scenarios within the simulations by including the non - uniform ionizing background near galaxies in each case , as well as the additional effect of non - equilibrium neutral fractions in the agn case . for details of these models",
    "see @xcite .",
    "figure 1b compares the results of these two calculations to the original , no - feedback , calculation .",
    "photoionization has minimal impact on the mean decrement even at small @xmath10 .",
    "it is tempting to think that increasing either the agn luminosities or the escape fraction of ionizing photons could produce a larger effect , but this is not the case because the total output of the sources can not exceed the uv background , which is itself constrained by the mean ( unconditional ) flux decrement .",
    "the models we have presented are close to maximal , with the observed galaxies or their agn assumed to produce @xmath21 of the entire uv background .",
    "outflows have been detected in lbgs by looking at the difference between absorption and emission features within these systems @xcite .",
    "strong winds from supernovae are a generic property of starburst galaxies and have the effect of shocking and sweeping up the material in their wake , both of which lead to decreased absorption inside the `` sphere of influence '' of the wind .",
    "we have constructed very simple `` wind '' models in which we eliminate all neutral hydrogen in a spherical region of radius @xmath22 around each galaxy in the simulation sample .",
    "we note that this model is highly optimistic since it assumes either _ perfect _ entrainment of the material in the volume out to @xmath22 or sufficient energy injection to completely ionize hydrogen within this radius . neither",
    "condition is necessarily expected to hold for realistic winds ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "figure 1c shows the result of the wind model for the 40 galaxies with the highest star formation rates in a simulation box of side @xmath23 mpc ( comoving ) . here",
    "the squares , pentagons , and hexagons correspond to models with constant comoving radii @xmath24 , and @xmath25 mpc respectively .",
    "stars show a model in which the volume of the wind around a galaxy is proportional to the baryonic mass of the galaxy , normalized such that the @xmath26 brightest galaxy has a wind radius of @xmath27 mpc and including winds around all 641 resolved galaxies in the box .",
    "the largest winds in this model extend to @xmath28 mpc , requiring an average propagation speed @xmath29 for a wind duration @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "only the most extreme wind models come close to matching the observational results .",
    "note , in particular that @xmath27 mpc winds do not eliminate , or even drastically reduce , absorption at @xmath32 mpc because much of the absorption at these separations in _ redshift space _ comes from infalling gas that is further than @xmath27 mpc in _",
    "real space_. these peculiar velocity effects are also the reason that photoionization has such a tiny impact ; even for near maximal models , the ionization does not strongly affect gas at such large distances .",
    "since the innermost data point comes from only three galaxy - los pairs , we must also ask whether it could just be an anomalous statistical fluctuation .",
    "we have done a monte carlo calculation in which we draw 500 sets of 3 galaxies from our population of @xmath33 simulated galaxies and compute the value of @xmath14 at @xmath34 mpc for each 3-tuple .",
    "figure 1d shows the cumulative distribution of the flux decrement from these samples .",
    "we see that our baseline calculation can virtually never get to decrements as low as those observed .",
    "even with a redshift error of @xmath35 , one sees decrements below 0.36 only @xmath36 of the time . for the most extreme wind model ,",
    "we find decrements as low as the observed one , @xmath37 , @xmath36 of the time . despite the limited size of the current data set , the observed `` lbg proximity effect ''",
    "stands as a striking result , not easily explained .",
