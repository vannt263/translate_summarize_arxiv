    "let us recall some definitions .",

    "if , e.g. , @xmath20 is a pair of a positive and a negative definite quadrature formula of order @xmath2 and @xmath21 is @xmath2-convex , then for the true value of @xmath19 $ ] we have the inclusion @xmath22\\leq i[f]\\leq q^{-}[f]$ ] .",
    "this simple observation serves as a base for derivation of a posteriori error estimates and rules for termination of calculations ( stopping rules ) in automatic numerical integration algorithms ( see @xcite for a survey ) .",
    "most of quadratures used in practice ( e.g. , quadrature formulae of gauss , radau , lobatto , newton - cotes ) are definite of certain order .",
    "definite @xmath23-point quadrature formulae with smallest positive or largest negative error constant are called optimal definite quadrature formulae .",
    "let us set @xmath24    it should be pointed out that it is fairly not obvious that the above infimums are attained or that the optimal definite quadrature formulae are unique .",
    "the existence of optimal definite quadrature formulae was first proven by schmeisser @xcite for even @xmath2 , and for arbitrary @xmath2 and more general boundary conditions by jetter @xcite and lange @xcite .",
    "the uniqueness has been proven by lange @xcite . for even @xmath2 , lange @xcite",
    "has shown that @xmath25 for @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the @xmath2-th bernoulli polynomial with leading coefficient @xmath28 .",
    "schmeisser @xcite proved that the same result holds for optimal definite quadrature formulae with equidistant nodes .",
    "the @xmath23-point optimal positive definite and the @xmath29-point optimal negative definite quadrature formulae of order @xmath30 are well - known : these are the @xmath23-th compound midpoint and trapezium quadrature formulae , respectively .",
    "the case @xmath31 is exceptional , as for @xmath32 the optimal definite quadrature formulae are not known .",
    "lange @xcite has computed numerically , for @xmath33 , the @xmath23-point optimal definite quadrature formulae of order @xmath34 and the @xmath23-point optimal positive definite quadrature formulae of order @xmath35 .",
    "it is a general observation about the optimality concept in quadratures that , even though the existence and the uniqueness of the optimal quadrature formulae ( for instance , in the non - periodic sobolev classes of functions ) is established , the optimal quadrature formulae remain unknown . this fact severely reduces the practical importance of optimal quadratures .",
    "the way out of this situation is to look for quadrature formulae which are nearly optimal , e.g. , for sequences of asymptotically optimal quadrature formulae .",
    "let @xmath36 be a sequence of positive ( resp , negative ) definite quadrature formulae of order @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath38 is said to be _ asymptotically optimal _ positive ( negative ) definite quadrature formula of order @xmath2 , if @xmath39    in @xcite schmeisser proposed an approach for construction of asymptotically optimal definite quadrature formulae of even order @xmath2 with equidistant nodes .",
    "khler and nikolov @xcite have studied gauss - type quadrature formulae associated with spaces of splines with double and equidistant knots , and as a result obtained bounds for the best constants @xmath40 and @xmath41 . in particular , it has been shown in @xcite that for even @xmath2 the corresponding gauss - type quadrature formulae are asymptotically optimal definite quadrature formulae .",
    "motivated by this result , in @xcite nikolov found explicit recurrence formulae for the evaluation of the nodes and the weights of the gaussian formulae for the spaces of cubic splines with double equidistant knots , and proposed a numerical procedure for the construction of the lobatto quadrature formulae for the same spaces of splines . according to @xcite , the gauss and the lobatto quadrature formulae for these spaces of splines are respectively asymptotically optimal positive definite and asymptotically optimal negative definite , of order @xmath35 .",
    "although the evaluation of gauss - type quadrature formulae for spaces of splines ( also with single knots , because of their asymptotical optimality in certain sobolev classes , see @xcite ) is highly desirable , there is a serious problem occurring already with the splines of degree @xmath34 , and its difficulty increases with the splines degree : the mutual displacement of the nodes of the quadratures and the splines knots is unknown . for justifying the location of the quadrature abscissae with respect to the knots of the space of splines , additional assumptions are to be made .",
    "for instance , in a recent paper @xcite ait - haddou , barto and calo extended the procedure from @xcite for explicit evaluation of the gaussian quadrature formulae for spaces of @xmath42 cubic splines with non - equidistant knots , assumming that the spline knots are symmetrically stretched . for another approach to the construction of gaussian quadrature formulae for @xmath43 cubic splines via homotopy continuation , see @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we construct several sequences of asymptotically optimal definite quadrature formulae of order @xmath35 with explicitly given nodes and weights . for their construction",
    "we make use of the euler - maclaurin summation formulae , associated with the midpoint and the trapezium quadrature formulae , replacing the values of the derivatives at the end - points by appropriate formulae for numerical differentiation ( this idea is not new , it can be traced in the book of brass @xcite , and , implicitly , has been applied already in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , our quadrature formulae differ from the compound midpoint or compound trapezium quadrature formula by very little : they have only few different weights and/or involve few additional nodes .",
    "we evaluate the error constants of our quadrature formulae , which , in view of their asymptotical optimality , are not essentially different .",
    "our motivation for proposing not just two sequences of asymptotically optimal positive definite and negative definite quadrature formulae of order @xmath35 is that , when chosen appropriately , pairs of definite quadrature formulae of the same type furnish , similarly to the case of pairs of definite quadrature formulae of opposite type , error inclusions for @xmath19 $ ] whenever the integrand @xmath8 is @xmath35-convex or @xmath35-concave .",

    "4 we prove monotonicity of the remainders of some of our definite quadrature formulae under the assumption that the integrand is @xmath35-convex ( concave ) , and as a result obtain a posteriori error estimates . section 5 shows some numerical experiments , and section 6 contains some final remarks .",
