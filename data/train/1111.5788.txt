    "since their discovery twenty years ago , carbon nanotubes ( cnt ) have attracted a very strong interest among the scientific community .",
    "they are indeed fascinating objects on an academic point of view , and they are foreseen for a large panel of future applications . among these potential applications , some rely strongly on the helicity of cnts , mostly concerning electrical transport properties , but present elaboration techniques do not enable to control this helicity : this is a challenge for the future .",
    "it is highly desirable to better understand how cnts with different helicities nucleate and grow through their synthesis process , in the hope of controlling helicity .    in a preceding paper",
    ", i proposed a simple model of  nucleation and growth of single wall carbon nanotubes \" @xcite .",
    "i showed that it is possible to build embryos of cnts on a graphene plane just by adding a number of bi - interstitials , and to make them grow by a similar mechanism , involving a very restricted number of defects , namely carbon interstitials , stone - wales defects and dislocations .    in the present paper ,",
    "i continue this work , which was done systematically for a lot of geometries and helicities , and i show that in the framework of the model some helicities are clearly favored against others .",
    "i compare these results with experimental data , which are discussed .",
    "the model for nucleation and growth of cnts used here corresponds to the so - called root - growth mechanism .",
    "a good example of the use of this mechanism is the vision proposed by maiti et al .",
    "@xcite : a graphene layer wraps metallic catalytic particles oversaturated in carbon .",
    "embryos of cnts , fed with interstitial c atoms dissolved in the catalyst , can form on this layer , and subsequently grow from their foot .",
    "more recent papers go in the same direction .",
    "for instance , gavillet et al .",
    "@xcite suggest a root - growth mechanism , after a study both by high - resolution transmission electron microscopy and quantum - molecular - dynamics simulations .",
    "they state that they  will show that carbon atoms can be added at the root of a growing tube by a diffusion - segregation process occurring at the surface of the catalytic particle . \"",
    "similarly , ding et al .",
    "@xcite , in the framework of the vls model ( vapor - liquid - solid ) , describe the tube growth  by small graphitic islands that form on the supersaturated cluster surface . \"",
    "the growth model suggested by nasibulin et al .",
    "@xcite is again quite similar .",
    "a carbon layer is said to be present on the surface of the metallic catalyst particle . in their fig .",
    "5 , they suggest that the c interstitials can come both from the saturated catalytic grain and from carbon entering continuously the grain through the opposite face of the particle .    on this basis ,",
    "my model lies on the fact that an embryo is nucleated in the graphene plane , so that it can grow from the foot , perpendicularly to the plane .",
    "negative curvature on the graphene sheet comes from the presence of heptagonal rings , and positive curvature from pentagonal rings .",
    "the cap of the embryo must contain exactly 6 pentagons , with exactly 6 heptagons around the foot of the embryo @xcite .",
    "nucleation of an embryo of ( 12,0 ) cnt on a graphene plane : 24 c interstitials are added in the 12 cells delimited by the dark lines and atoms . ]    to build such an embryo , let us consider , on the honeycomb network of a graphene plane , an hexagonal ( regular or not ) contour of elementary hexagonal cells , containing @xmath0 such hexagonal cells , @xmath0 being an integer greater or equal to 6 .",
    "we add @xmath1 c interstitials , two per cell , coming from the carbon - saturated metallic catalyst .",
    "an example of this process is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : build ] : a 12-cell contour is delimited by the two dark lines , 24 c interstitials are added , and bounds are rebuild in such a way to get a ( 12,0 ) zigzag tube . there is a lot of possibilities to build bounds between the interstitials as well as between them and the other c atoms of the plane . among all these possibilities ,",
    "there are several arrangements giving rise to an embryo with the required 6 pentagons and 6 heptagons .",
    "such arrangements can be labeled by the usual indices @xmath2 and @xmath3 , corresponding to a @xmath4 tube with @xmath5 .",
    "one can see quite easily that by such a process all the helicities , i.e. all the @xmath2 and @xmath3 values obeying @xmath5 , are reachable ; moreover , in general , there is a number of isomers for each helicity .",
    "we can recall here the well - known fact that all helicities can be described by taking both @xmath3 and @xmath2 as positive or zero integers , with the condition @xmath6 ( which implies @xmath7 ) .    once the interstitials are introduced and the bounds established ,",
    "it is necessary to let the bond length and angles relax towards equilibrium and to check the stability and energy of the proposed defect geometries .",
    "i performed energy minimizations by using the tersoff model @xcite .",
    "the embryos are built on a parallelogram - shaped portion of a graphene plane , with periodic conditions in the @xmath8 and @xmath9 directions .",
    "this gives rise in fact to an embryo hexagonal network ; i made calculations with varying the distance between embryos , in terms of carbon hexagonal cell rows , from one to three rows .",
