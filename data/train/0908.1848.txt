    "covariant density functional theory ( dft ) based on relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory provides a microscopically consistent description of the nuclear many - body problem  @xcite .",
    "conventional dft without particle - particle ( pp ) correlations can be applied only for a few doubly closed shell nuclei . for the vast majority of nuclei and in particular those far away from the @xmath1-stability line , that play an important role in astrophysical applications ,",
    "the inclusion of particle - particle correlations is essential for a quantitative description of many phenomena in nuclear structure . in the framework of dft pairing correlations",
    "are taken into account in the form of hartree - bogoliubov theory  @xcite for the ground states .",
    "because of the numerical complexity of the deformed hartree - bogoliubov equations , monopole pairing or density dependent @xmath2-pairing interactions have been widely used in the literature for deformed mean field calculations  @xcite .",
    "but the results are affected by a cutoff parameter which has to be introduced in a rather arbitrary way .",
    "recent investigations show clearly that many results depend on this cut - off  @xcite . therefore , in order to avoid the complicated problem of a pairing cutoff , the finite range gogny force@xcite has been applied in many relativistic applications  @xcite .",
    "the parameters of this force have been adjusted very carefully in a semi - phenomenological way to characteristic properties of the microscopic effective interactions and to experimental data  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown in several applications that the rhb model with gogny pairing provides an excellent tool for the description of ground state properties in finite nuclei .",
    "such investigations have been first devoted to spherical applications , such as to halo phenomenon in light nuclei  @xcite , to the properties of nuclei near the neutron drip line  @xcite , to the reduction of the spin - orbit potential in nuclei with extreme isospin values  @xcite , to ground - state properties of ni and sn isotopes  @xcite , etc .",
    "rhb theory with gogny pairing has also been applied to investigate deformed  @xcite and rotating  @xcite nuclei , but such calculations are limited due to their numerical complicity .",
    "recently we have introduced a new separable form of the pairing force for rhb calculations in spherical nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the parameters of this separable force are adjusted to reproduce the pairing properties of the gogny force in nuclear matter .",
    "it preserves translational invariance and has finite range .",
    "a similar ansatz has been used in the pairing channel of non - relativistic skyrme calculations in refs .",
    "this pairing interaction is separable in momentum space . in @xmath3-space",
    "the translational invariance leads to a @xmath4-force in the center of mass coordinates and therefore , at a first glance , translational invariance forbids exact separability . however using well known techniques of talmi and moshinsky  @xcite it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that this force can be represented by a sum of separable terms which converges quickly .",
    "this avoids the complicated problem of a cutoff at large momenta or energies inherent in zero range pairing forces . as we discussed in fig .",
    "6 of ref .",
    "@xcite , we found that although the @xmath4-force can give the same average gap as the gogny force d1s if the size of the strength is adjusted properly , the individual matrix elements of the forces and the matrix elements of the pairing field @xmath5 are very different from each other",
    ". the @xmath4-force behaves in some sense very much like a constant pairing . in contract",
    "our separable force has a very similar behavior to the gogny force",
    ".    this simple separable force can reproduce the pairing properties of the ground - state for spherical nuclei on almost the same footing as the original gogny pairing interaction .",
    "recently it has also been applied for studying dynamic properties of spherical nuclei  @xcite . the relativistic quasiparticle random phase approximation ( rqrpa ) based on the same separable pairing interaction in the pairing channel",
    "was used for calculations of low - lying 2@xmath6 and 3@xmath7 excited states in a chain of sn - isotopes , which are very sensitive to the pairing channel . in comparison with experimental data and with the results of the original gogny force",
    "it was shown that this simple separable pairing interaction is also very successful in depicting the dynamical pairing properties of vibrational excitations .",
    "so far , the new separable pairing force has been used only in spherical nuclei . in this article",
    "we apply this separable pairing force for axially deformed relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( rhbz ) calculations . for axially symmetric",
    "shapes the densities are invariant with respect to a rotation around the symmetry axis , which is taken to be the z - axis .",
    "therefore it is convenient to work in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the talmi and moshinsky techniques  @xcite used in ref .",
    "@xcite are restricted to spherical coordinates .",
    "therefore we had to develop similar techniques for cylindrical coordinates working in an anisotropic oscillator basis .",
    "again the matrix elements of this pairing force in this basis are no longer fully separable .",
    "however they can be expanded , as in the spherical case , in a series of separable terms .",
    "obviously the convergence of this expansion is not as fast as in the spherical case , it is still quick enough to save considerable numerical effort as compared to the full gogny calculations .",
    "finally we investigate for a chain of sm - isotopes the ground - state properties such as binding energies and deformations using the rhbz - program with this new separable pairing force . as it is known , the ground - state properties of the deformed nuclei are highly affected by the pairing gap .",
    "good agreement is found , when comparing with experimental data and with theoretical calculations using rmf + bcs theory with a constant pairing force , or using non - relativistic hartree - fock bogoliubov ( hfb ) theory with the full gogny force d1s .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows .",

    "@xmath33 are matrix elements of two - body pairing interaction . in general",
    "this should be a relativistic force  @xcite and involve large and small components .",

    "it then turns out to be useful to work with the cylindrical coordinates @xmath36 in these coordinates the dirac equation can be reduced to a coupled set of partial differential equations in the two variables @xmath37 and @xmath38 that are solved by an expansion in an anisotropic harmonic oscillator basis  @xcite .",

    "so we use the fact that the product of two oscillator functions in the coordinates of the two particles can be expanded in terms of products of oscillator functions in the relative and in the center of mass coordinates .",
