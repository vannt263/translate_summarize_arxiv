    "the number of old open clusters ( age @xmath51 gyr ) is @xmath660 @xcite or only @xmath64% of the all known clusters in the milky way @xcite . because of this small number of such clusters and the fact that many of them are poorly populated , any addition to this body of old clusters is highly desirable .",
    "here we report a serendipitous discovery of an old open cluster among the known registered clusters in the webda .",
    "it seems to be enlightning and worthy to reflect on what initially led us to this object . in march of 2008",
    "we had an observing run at the 2.2 m mpg / eso telescope with the feros spectrograph .",
    "for the morning hours , there were no regular targets available and , hence , we started to look for some old open cluster with 12@xmath7@xmath8ra@xmath816@xmath7 .",
    "there are 7 such clusters in the webda but none of them appeared to be well - suited for our instrumental setup or offering a compelling science .",
    "a search for other potential targets led us to a large photometric survey of 55 young open clusters in the southern sky by @xcite .",
    "the primary goal of their survey was to examine the age and evolutionary dependence of the be star phenomenon . examining the provided color - magnitude diagrams ( cmd ) our attention was caught by the cmd of trumpler  20 .",
    "it was obvious that for this cluster the authors had missed out a characteristic signature of all old open cluster  that is the red clump , prominently displayed in its cmd at @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( * ? ? ?",
    "these authors opted for a young 160 myr cluster , instead .",
    "the apparent lack of reliable parameters for trumpler  20 ( tr  20 hereafter ) prompted the present study .    in the discovery paper @xcite ,",
    "tr  20 ( = c1236 - 603 ) is described as a `` rich cluster of regular outline composed exclusively of very faint stars nearly evenly scattered '' and classified as a type iii  2r cluster . using the calibrations between the estimated diameter in parsecs and the apparent angular diameter , for this cluster with an angular diameter of",
    "10@xmath4 trumpler reports a distance equal to 2240  pc .",
    "a few decades later , @xcite estimated the total number of cluster members from starcounts to be at @xmath6200 down to @xmath11@xmath617 .",
    "the strmgren @xmath12 photometry given in @xcite has a limited potential in deriving a photometric distance of tr  20 because it covers as little as @xmath61.5 mag of its main sequence .",
    "one helpful hint from the paper by @xcite is the noted relatively high reddening in this area of the sky at @xmath13@xmath60.35 . for the open clusters located within @xmath14 from tr  20 ,",
    "the webda database offers additional reddening estimates , reaching up to @xmath15 .",
    "the access to high - resolution spectroscopy at the 2.2 m mpg / eso gave us an opportunity to measure radial velocities for a few possible tr  20 members and even attempt to measure its metallicity [ fe / h ] .",
    "another fortunate concurrence involved an access to photometric observations at the 1 m telescope of the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) .",
    "these two facilities allowed us to collect the necessary data and were instrumental in obtaining fundamental properties of tr  20 .",
    "in 2008 march 20 - 22 , new photometric ccd observations of tr  20 were obtained at the ctio 1-m telescope , operated by the small and moderate aperture research telescope system ( smarts ) consortium .",
    "the instrumental setup includes the y4k cam consisting of an sta 4064@xmath174064 ccd with 15-@xmath18 m pixels mounted in the ln@xmath19 dewar .",
    "the pixel scale is @xmath20 pix@xmath21 , allowing to cover a field - of - view of 20@xmath320@xmath4 .    [",

    "its true age should be close to 1.3  gyr despite a relatively poor match to the red giant clump .",

    "the location of the red - giant clump with respect to this isochrone clearly favors a younger age .",

    ", width=317 ]    two rich open clusters ngc  2660 and ngc  2477  close analogs of tr  20  were selected from the webda to illustrate the sensitivity of cluster parameters upon the isochrone fit .",
    "the available ccd @xmath23 photometry from @xcite for ngc  2660 and from @xcite for ngc  2477 was de - reddened in the same fashion as for tr  20 . to fit the de - reddened cmds ( figs .",
    "3,4 ) , we used a solar - metallicity 1.3  gyr isochrone with convective overshoot from @xcite . according to the analysis of high - resolution spectroscopy , both clusters have essentially a solar metallicity @xcite",
    "the placement of the red giant clump relative to the 1.3  gyr isochrone indicates that the age of ngc  2660 is close to 1.3  gyr but the age of ngc  2477 is definitely lower than 1.3  gyr , in agreement with conclusions from the original studies .",
    "however , we note a need for a lower reddening in both clusters , provided the metallicity is correct . for a 1.3  gyr isochrone near the turnoff of main sequence , an increase of [ fe / h ] by 0.1",
    "dex is equivalent to the decrease of @xmath13 by @xmath60.035 mag .",
    "therefore , in deriving the cluster parameters from an isochrone fit , a prior accurate and consistent metallicity determination is crucial to this method .",
    "the spatial distribution of stars over the fov can serve to estimate the angular extent of tr  20 and the cumulative number of cluster members brighter than the limiting magnitude of our study .",
    "figure  5 shows the density of stars as a function of radial distance ( radius @xmath24 ) from the cluster center . to construct this distribution",
    ", we used only the stars with reliable @xmath23 photometry .",
    "it is evident that the cluster has an angular diameter at least 16@xmath4 , which at the nominal distance of tr  20 translates into 15  pc of linear diameter .",
    "assuming that the density of field stars down to our limiting magnitude is about 9 stars per arcmin@xmath25 , the cumulative number of cluster members down to @xmath26=@xmath274 is @xmath6700 .",
    "even this conservative estimate is indicative of a very rich open cluster .    .",
    ", width=317 ]",
    "trumpler 20 has several features which makes it attractive for the future studies .",
    "there is no doubt that tr  20 is a @xmath61.3 gyr old open cluster . in its age group",
    "tr  20 appears to be the richest galactic open clusters .",
    "our isochrone fit by no means can be considered final .",
    "it also carries a burden of correlations between the distance , age , metallicity , and reddening . among the parameters derived in this study ,",
    "the reddening estimate is clearly the least satisfactory .",
    "we provide potential clues possibly biasing our reddening estimate , which should help in planning the future photometric observations .",
    "the upper part of cmd requires a rigorous clean - up by the means of radial velocities to better delineate the upper main sequence , sub - giant , and giant branches . although we are confident that the metallicity of tr  20 is slightly sub - solar , it is desirable to obtain high - resolution spectra for the clump stars and redo the analysis and try to eliminate the apparent discrepancy between the photometric and spectroscopic @xmath1 .",
    "it is not clear what causes a considerable width of the main sequence , reaching @xmath60.3 mag .",
    "is it differential reddening , large population of binaries , or a combination of both ?",
    "the observed spread of the red clump star colors indicates that differential reddening in tr  20 may not exceed @xmath60.1 mag in @xmath28 .",
    "there is a hint of the blue straggler population which photometrically is impossible to disantangle from numerous field stars .",
    "we hope that the future studies will enable refining the cluster parameters and possibly open up new venues of research of this rich open cluster .",
