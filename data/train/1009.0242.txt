    "applications in nuclear and medical imaging as well as homeland security have recently led to a resurgence of research in the field of radiation detection .",
    "specifically , this has motivated the search for new materials to improve the performance of room - temperature semiconductor radiation detectors.@xcite aluminum antimonide , which is a iii - v semiconductor with an indirect band gap of 1.69ev , is a promising candidates but its potential for radiation detection has not been conclusively established yet.@xcite    the basic mechanism underlying radiation detection in a semiconductor can be summarized as follows : ( 1 ) an incoming quantum of radiation transfers energy to the electrons in the material creating electron - hole pairs , ( 2 ) the charge carriers are separated in an externally applied electric field , ( 3 ) the magnitude of the resulting electric current is measured . to achieve maximum energy resolution , the `` loss '' of charge carriers due to scattering and",
    "recombination events must be minimized .",
    "this requires high carrier mobilities and very low concentrations of intrinsic defects and impurities .",
    "in addition , a very high resistivity is desirable to maintain a low concentration of background free carriers and thereby to minimize noise events .",
    "for instance , in germanium detectors that are used at cryogenic temperatures , defect and impurity concentrations have to be reduced to less than @xmath0 and free carrier densities to less than @xmath1 to reach optimal performance.@xcite to meet such stringent bounds a highly optimized manufacturing process is needed , which typically implies years of research and development .",
    "this situation renders the screening of candidate materials extremely challenging .",
    "predictive computations , however , offer a possibility to circumvent this difficulty , since they allow studying the fundamental limits of materials in a much more time effective and systematic fashion .",
    "specifically , quantum mechanical methods based on density - functional theory can be used to compute the formation energies of intrinsic and extrinsic defects and their equilibrium concentrations .",
    "they also allow one to obtain the defect - limited scattering rates , which determine the mobility and life time of free charge carriers .",
    "since these calculations can be done for idealized systems , it is possible to separate the effects of different intrinsic and extrinsic defects and determine the ultimate performance limits .",
    "the objective of the present paper is to elucidate the role of extrinsic defects in aluminum antimonide on the basis of first - principles calculations .",
    "specifically , we seek to establish which elements are the most detrimental for the electronic properties of alsb and which elements can be introduced intentionally to compensate for intrinsic defects and impurities . in short",
    ", it will be shown that ( _ i _ ) c , si , and ge substitute on sb sites and act as acceptors with shallow transition levels , ( _ ii _ ) sn can substitute on both al and sb sites and displays amphoteric characteristics , ( _ iii _ ) s , se , and te substitute on sb and act as donors with deep equilibrium transition levels , ( _ iv _ ) o is most likely to be incorporated as an interstitial and predominantly acts as an acceptor , ( _ v _ ) p substitutes for sb and is electrically inactive , ( _ vi _ ) c and o have the most detrimental effect on carrier transport , while ( _ vii _ ) te is a weak scatterer and can therefore be used to manipulate the net concentration of charge carriers with a modest effect on their mobilities .",
    "the present study represents a continuation of our earlier work on intrinsic defects in alsb @xcite and is connected to our recent fully quantum - mechanical calculations of defect - limited carrier mobilities.@xcite    lcl    [ cols= \" > , > \" , ]      +   +    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "we typically calculated formation energies for charge states between @xmath39 and @xmath40 , and where necessary also included charge states @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we also investigated the formation of defect complexes of group iv and vi elements with aluminum vacancies @xmath43 and antimony antisites @xmath44 which are the two most important intrinsic defects.@xcite      calculations were performed within density - functional theory ( dft ) using the local density approximation ( lda ) and the projector augmented wave method @xcite as implemented in the vienna ab - initio simulation package .",
    "@xcite    in our earlier study @xcite of intrinsic defects in alsb we employed a variety of supercell sizes in combination with a finite - size scaling procedure in order to mitigate the limitations of the supercell method .",
    "given the large number of different elements , defect structures , and charge states considered in the present work , such a comprehensive approach is , however , beyond our present computational capabilities .",
    "we therefore carried out the majority of the calculations for 64-atom supercells , which based on the results of ref .",
    "implies that the error in our calculated formation energies due to the supercell approximation is still only on the order of 0.1ev . for brillouin - zone integrations we used a @xmath45 monkhorst - pack mesh .",

    "we used a plane - wave cutoff energy of 500ev , which is imposed by the pseudo - potential for oxygen , but for the sake of consistency was used for all calculations . a gaussian smearing with a width of @xmath48",

    "the ionic positions were optimized until the maximum force was below @xmath49 . for the charged defect calculations a homogeneous background charge",

    "analysis of the electronic structure of the defects in this work reveals that in many cases the defect induces electronic levels in the band gap , which renders the separation into valence , conduction or localized states highly unreliable . since as a result the application of the correction scheme employed in ref",

    "the two most important contributions to the scattering cross section of a defect are related to the amount of charge localized at the defect ( coulomb scattering ) and the lattice distortions that accompany defect relaxation .",
    "since we are primarily interested in comparing defects that have identical absolute charge states ( e.g. , @xmath50 _ vs _ @xmath51 ) , in the following we focus on the second contribution only .",

    "this quantity includes not only ionic relaxations but also changes in the electronic charge distribution .    in eq .",
    "( [ eq : relscat ] ) we use the potential and not for example the charge density difference .",

    ", we consider four important cases .",
    "first , we analyze the pure material ( containing only intrinsic defects ) .",
    "then , we include in our model unintentional impurities from the growth process , followed by analysis of carrier compensation with intentional te doping .",

    "[ sect : method_compdetails ] , in the present work we did not employ any such corrections . before we can apply the self - consistent charge equilibration scheme to study the behavior of extrinsically doped alsb , we therefore have to discuss to which extent the band gap error influences the results . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ne ] ) the intrinsic electron and hole concentrations depend exponentially on the band gap . to be consistent with the calculations discussed above",
    ", we now have to use the lda band gap and the corresponding formation energies for the intrinsic defects .",
    "absolute _ carrier concentrations are therefore no longer comparable to our calculations in ref .  .",
    "for the present purpose , we are , however , interested not in absolute carrier concentrations but in _ net _ charge carrier concentrations , i.e. the difference between the concentrations of electron and holes , @xmath105 the impact of the band gap error on @xmath106 is not immediately obvious . in fig .  [ fig : dneh_ideal ] , we therefore compare the net electron concentrations for pure alsb using as - calculated formation energies as well as formation energies , which have been corrected for the band gap error .",
    "we find that while the actual values deviate somewhat , the conduction type ( @xmath107 _ vs _ @xmath108 ) , chemical potential dependence , and the order of magnitude of @xmath106 are very similar .",
    "this finding enables us to use the as - calculated formation energies to compute net charge carrier concentrations for alsb with extrinsic defects .",
    "figure  [ fig : dneh_ideal ] also shows that pure alsb exhibits @xmath107-type behavior over the entire range of the chemical potential difference .",
    "in contrast , as - grown alsb has been found to exhibit @xmath108-type conductivity . in the following section ,",
    "we show that this apparent discrepancy is caused by the accidental incorporation of impurities during growth .      in the experimental growth process ,",
    "certain impurities are impossible to avoid .",
    "in particular this includes oxygen and carbon.@xcite oxygen can be incorporated from the gas phase or the components of the growth chamber and is also present in the raw starting materials .",

    "[ fig : dneh_co ] , we show the net charge carrier concentrations for alsb with @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "in fact , these concentrations cause the conductivity to switch from @xmath107-type to @xmath108-type , which resolves the apparent discrepancy between theory and experiment mentioned above .",
    "the inversion of the conductivity - type is indeed expected since in sec .",
    "[ sect : eform ] both of these impurities have been identified as acceptors .",
    "since the background doping by c and o renders the material @xmath108-type , compensation requires addition of donor ions . to simultaneously achieve high carrier mobilities and low net carrier concentrations",
    ", the dopant should possess a scattering potential which is as small as possible . according to figs .",
    "[ fig : eform1 ] and [ fig : relscat ] te is an ideal candidate based on these criteria . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dneh_cote ] we show the effect of adding te at a concentration of @xmath110 to alsb containing c and o impurities .",
    "we find that by using te doping in this concentration range the net charge carrier concentration can be tuned very efficiently .",
    "the net carrier concentration changes as a function of the chemical potential difference between al and sb , with a minimum close to the sb - rich limit ( typical annealing condition ) .",
    "intentional doping with te therefore enables us to compensate the background doping due to c and o impurities while minimizing the detrimental impact on the carrier mobilities .",
