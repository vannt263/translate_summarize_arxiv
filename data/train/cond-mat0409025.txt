    "cellular automata are statistical - mechanical models which present a complex behavior , despite their relatively simple dynamic rules . in general",
    "these models are defined in @xmath4-dimensional lattices with linear dimension @xmath5 , in which each site @xmath6 @xmath7 is occupied by a variable @xmath8 . the dynamic rules of a typical cellular automaton have two basic characteristics : firstly , the update of a variable @xmath9 depends only on its neighborhood ( short - range interactions ) . secondly , given a configuration of the system at instant @xmath2 , at instant @xmath10 all variables @xmath9 @xmath11",
    "are updated at once .",
    "the use of cellular automata in order to mimic biological immune systems has improved the understanding about the microscopic mechanisms that lead to the macroscopic behavior of these systems @xcite .",
    "for example , cellular automata are as usefull to describe the t - helper cells response under parasitic infections brass94,brass94a as they are to model the course of the human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) infection @xcite .",
    "brass _ et al .",
    "_ divised a simple cellular automaton model of @xmath12 cell interactions to mimic the immune system of mice exposed to parasitic infections @xcite .",
    "the model is defined in a cubic ( @xmath13 ) lattice in which each site is occupied by one of three different @xmath14 cell types : @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 cells .",
    "t - helper cells that have not yet been presented to the antigen are denoted by @xmath18 . in the model , two distinct routes ( equivalent to two populations of antigen presenting cells )",
    "govern the maturing of a @xmath18 cell : antigen presented by the first ( second ) route elicit a @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) response . in order to take into account the competition between",
    "mature @xmath14 cells , the induction @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) is forbidden when the neighborhood of the @xmath15 cell has an overall majority of @xmath17 ( @xmath23 ) cells .",
    "at last , a mature cell dies ( it is substituted by a @xmath24 cell ) if such a cell is not restimulated by the appropriate antigen within the time interval @xmath25 . the model can display a spontaneous symmetry breaking as one varies the antigen density or the cutoff @xmath25 , in agreement with experimental results @xcite .",
    "a probabilistic version of the model was proposed by tom and drugowich de felcio @xcite by allowing the death of cells @xmath19 and @xmath20 at each time step with a probability @xmath26 .",
    "thus , in this modified version of the model , the lifetime @xmath25 was substituted by a mean lifetime related to the probability @xmath26 .",
    "also , the development of @xmath24 cells into either @xmath27 or @xmath28 cells occurs with a probability that depends on the neghborhood of the @xmath29 cell and on a parameter @xmath30 , related to the antigen density .",
    "such probabilistic version presents the intrinsic spontaneous symmetry breaking found in the brass _ et al .",
    "_ automaton , besides being amenable to an analytical approach @xcite .",
    "the critical behavior of the probabilistic model proposed in ref .",

    "their results suggest that the probabilistic automaton , although not satisfying detailed balance , belongs to the same universality class of the two - dimensional kinetic ising model @xcite , thus supporting the _ up - down _ conjecture , introduced by grinstein _",
    "_ grinstein85 . in a subsequent work , tom and",

    "we have revisited the probabilistic automaton of ref .",
    "we have re - obtained the dynamic critical exponent @xmath0 of the automaton by using a recent technique that mixes different initial conditions @xcite .",

    "_ @xcite , who showed that even far from equilibrium the short - time relaxation of the order parameter follows a universal scale form @xmath33where @xmath34 is the order parameter at instant @xmath2 ( measured in monte carlo steps per spin - mcs ) , @xmath35 is a small initial @xmath36 value of the order parameter , and @xmath37 is the dynamic critical exponent , related to the increasing of the order parameter after the quenching of the system ( when dealing with monte carlo simulations , the time @xmath2 is discrete and measured in monte carlo steps per spin - mcs ) .",
    "( [ m0tatheta ] ) demands working with sharply prepared initial states with a precise value of @xmath38 . after obtaining the critical exponent @xmath37 for a number of @xmath38 values , the final value for @xmath37 is obtained from the limit @xmath39 .",
    "starting from an ordered state @xmath40 , the order parameter @xmath34 decays in time , at the critical temperature , according to the power law zheng98 @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the average of the quantity @xmath43 over different samples with initial order parameter value @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the usual static critical exponents , related to the order parameter and to the correlation length , respectively , and @xmath0 is the dynamic critical exponent , defined as @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are time and spatial correlation lengths , respectively .    starting from a disordered configuration with @xmath50 , the second moment of the order parameter increases after the power law @xmath51 where the exponent @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 and @xmath4 is the dimension of the system .    by combining eqs .",
    "( [ bdnz ] ) and ( [ mquad ] ) , da silva _ et al . _",
    "@xcite obtained the ratio @xmath54 which corresponds to a function with mixed initial conditions . at this point , it is important to stress here that , from eq .",
    "( [ f2 ] ) above , two independent runs are necessary in order to calculate the ratio @xmath55 : in one of them @xmath50 ( numerator ) , while in the other one @xmath56 ( denominator ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath55 has proven to be useful in determining the exponent @xmath0 , according to recent studies of the 2d ising model @xcite , @xmath57 and @xmath58 states potts models @xcite , ising model with next - nearest - neighbor interactions @xcite , baxter - wu model arashiro03 , at the tricritical point of the 2d blume - capel model dasilva02a , at the lifshitz point of the 3d annni model @xcite and in other studies concerning models with one absorbent state dasilva04 .",
    "in addition , in this work we have also calculated the global persistence exponent @xmath59 @xcite , related to the probability that the order parameter of the model , @xmath34 , does not change its sign up to time @xmath2 , after a quench of the system to the critical temperature .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows : in section [ model ] we explain the model . in section [ opdcet ]",
    "we define the order parameter @xmath34 and we describe the methodology used in order to obtain the dynamic critical exponents @xmath59 and @xmath0 . in section [ results ] the results obtained for the exponents @xmath0 and @xmath59 are shown",
    ". finally , in section conclusion we present the main concluding remarks .",
    "in this work we have studied a two - dimensional probabilistic cellular automaton in which dynamics is governed by local stochastic rules . at each site @xmath6 of the square lattice",
    "we have attached a variable @xmath60 assuming the value @xmath61 or @xmath62 , depending on whether the site is occupied by a @xmath18 , a @xmath16 or a @xmath20 cell , respectively .",
    "considering @xmath63 the total number of sites in the lattice , we have defined the set @xmath64 to represent the microscopic state of the system .",
    "the probability of state @xmath65 at time @xmath2 , @xmath66 , evolves in time according to the equation @xmath67 where the transition probability @xmath68 from state @xmath69 to state @xmath70 obeys the condition @xmath71    on the other hand , for a system that evolves at discrete time steps , in which all the sites are updated at once , as is the case for the cellular automaton in this work , the transition probability @xmath72 is written in the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the conditional probability that site @xmath6 be in the state @xmath75 at time @xmath10 , given that the state of the system is @xmath65 at instant @xmath2 .",
    "such conditional probability satisfies the condition @xmath76 what implies immediately that eq .",
    "( [ soma1 ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "the cellular automaton investigated in this work belongs to the class of totalistic cellular automata @xcite .",
    "thus , the transition probability @xmath77 depends on @xmath60 and on the sum @xmath78 , where the sum runs over the neighborhood of site @xmath6 .",
    "more specifically , we are considering a particular kind of totalistic automaton for which @xmath74 depends only on the sign of the sum @xmath49 . by defining",
    "@xmath79 we may use the notation @xmath80 in order to explicit the transition probability dependence on @xmath60 and @xmath81 .",
    "the transition probabilities ( dynamical rules ) are given by @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 where , as discussed in section [ intro ] , @xmath26 is the death probability of @xmath85 and @xmath28 cells , and @xmath30 is a parameter related to the antigen density @xcite .    the dynamical rules ( [ dinamica1 ] ) , ( [ dinamica2 ] ) and ( [ dinamica3 ] ) above have `` up - down '' , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath86 therefore , following grinstein _",
    "@xcite , we expect that the probabilistic cellular automaton investigated in this work be at the same universality class of kinetic ising models .",
    "in the short - time monte carlo simulations performed in this work the order parameter @xmath34 , as well as its higher moments @xmath88 , were obtained from averages over a certain number of samples , @xmath89 . by defining the @xmath90th momentum of the order parameter in sample number @xmath91 at instant @xmath2 as @xmath92",

    "in the first method , we have performed short - time monte carlo simulations in order to calculate the global persistence probability @xmath101 , _ i.e. _ , the probability that the magnetization does not change its sign up to time @xmath2 . on the other hand ,",
    "the probability @xmath101 is numerically equal to the complement of the accumulated distribution @xmath102 , according to which the magnetization changes its sign for the first time exactly at instant @xmath2 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the number of samples for which the magnetization changes its sign for the first time at instant @xmath105 and @xmath89 is the total number of samples .",
    "the exponent @xmath59 may be obtained directly from the power law scale relation @xcite @xmath106 from which we obtain @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is constant and each run requires a sharply prepared initial state , with a precise small value of @xmath109 , as discussed in eq .",
    "( [ m0tatheta ] ) .    in a second way to obtain the exponent @xmath59 we have used the fact that the initial magnetization dependence of @xmath101 can be cast in the following finite - size scaling relation @xcite , @xmath110 which renders a different method to obtain the exponent @xmath1 from lattice sizes @xmath111 and @xmath112 @xcite . for this end",
    "we define @xmath113 , which turns out to be a function of @xmath114 . therefore ,",
    "if we fix the dynamic exponent @xmath0 , the exponent @xmath115 can be obtained by collapsing the time series @xmath116 onto @xmath117 as follows . under re - scaling , with @xmath118 , @xmath119 , we obtain @xmath120 and the best estimate for @xmath1 corresponds to the minimization of @xmath121 by interpolating @xmath122 to the time values @xmath123 . in order to obtain the exponent @xmath59 using the collapse method described above , it is not necessary to fix a precise value of the initial magnetization @xmath109 in the short - time simulations , once the scaling relation in eq .",
    "( leiescalapersisti ) does not take into account the initial conditions of the system .",
    "so , we have used initial states in which @xmath124 . on the other hand ,",
    "the collapse method demands the dynamic exponent @xmath0 to be known beforehand .",
