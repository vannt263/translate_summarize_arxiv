    "it is generally believed that the dark matter ( dm ) constitutes a large fraction of the mass in the universe and thus significantly affects , and on some scales dominates , the process of galaxy formation .",
    "observational evidence for large fractions of dm in galaxies , groups , and galaxy clusters ranges from flat rotational curves of spiral ( e.g. , faber & gallagher , 1979 ; rubin et al .",
    "1985 ; persic , salucci , & stel 1996 ; courteau & rix , 1997 ) and x - ray emission and mass - to - light ratios of elliptical ( forman et al.1985 ; rix 1997 ; brighenti & mathews 1997 ) galaxies to the baryon fractions in clusters of galaxies ( white et al . 1993 ; evrard 1997 ) . for galaxies ,",
    "the extent of the dm halos estimated using satellite dynamics , is @xmath12 mpc . ]",
    "( zaritsky & white 1994 ; carignan et al.1997 ) .",
    "a convincing evidence for substantial amounts of dark matter even in the very inner regions of galaxies comes from the recent hi studies of the dwarf and low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies .",
    "the observed amounts of stars and gas in some of these galaxies can account for less than @xmath13 of the observed rotational velocities at the last measured point of the rotation curves .",
    "( e.g. , carignan & freeman 1988 ; martimbeau , carignan , & roy 1994 ; de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ) .",
    "if the observed galaxies have large dm halos , then @xmath0-body simulations can , in principle , be used to predict distribution of the dark matter component , to associate the simulated dm halos with galaxies , and to predict the bulk properties of these galaxies such as position , mass , and size .",
    "one should be able then to make predictions about spatial distribution and motion of these simulated galaxies and compare these predictions with corresponding observations .",
    "unfortunately , the dissipationless numerical simulations have been consistently failing to produce galaxy - size dark matter halos in dense environments typical for galaxy groups and clusters ( e.g. , white 1976 ; van kampen 1995 ; summers , davis , & evrard 1995 ; moore , katz , & lake 1996 ) .",
    "this apparent absence of substructure in the virialized objects , known as _ the overmerging problem _ , reflects the fact that simulated galaxies seem to merge much more efficiently in comparison with real galaxies in groups and clusters . in the central regions of a cluster ( @xmath14 kpc ) ,",
    "the `` overmerging '' erases not only large - scale substructure , but also any trace of small halos that could be associated with `` galaxies '' , leaving a smooth giant lump of dark matter .",
    "the overmerging problem was traditionally explained by the lack of dissipation in @xmath0-body simulations ( e.g. , katz , hernquist & weinberg 1992 ; summers et al .",
    "1995 ) . indeed , the dm halos are much larger than baryonic extent of the galaxies due to the dissipational nature of the latter .",
    "the radiative cooling , for example , allows baryonic component to sink into the center of the dm halo where it forms a compact , tightly bound object . in dense environments",
    "the large dm halo can be easily stripped by the tidal field of a galaxy cluster or group , whereas the more compact and denser gas clump may survive ( summers et al .",
    "although it is clear that to produce a realistic galaxy we need to include the energy dissipation by baryons , it is not clear whether the dissipation is vital for the halo survival in a cluster .",
    "two arguments can be presented against the traditional explanation for the overmerging .",
    "first , if the dissipation helps galaxies to survive in clusters , then galaxies should be dominated by baryons at all scales within their visible extent .",
    "most of the observed galaxies , however , appear to have a substantial fraction of dm inside their optical radius ( e.g. , persic et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the survival of a galaxy dominated at its optical radius by the dark matter will depend mostly on the dark matter , not on the baryons .",
    "the dm dominated dwarfs must have been tidally disrupted , but dwarf galaxies are observed in clusters ( e.g. smith , driver , & phillipps 1997 ; lopez - cruz et al .",
    "second , as we argue in this paper , even in the absence of the baryons dm halos are dense enough to survive inside clusters and to be identified , provided that simulations have sufficient resolution _ in both _ mass and force ( similar conclusion was reached by moore et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to demonstrate that with a sufficient computational effort the overmerging problem can be tamed ( at least to some extent ) even in the purely dissipationless simulations .",
    "the computational costs are higher than cost of an average cosmological @xmath0-body simulation .",
    "however , they may be considerably lower than computational expense of the corresponding @xmath0-body@xmath15hydro simulations .",
    "this especially true in the case of large - volume ( @xmath16 ) simulations required to quantify the statistical properties of the `` galactic '' populations such as correlation function , pairwise velocity dispersions etc . to understand how the problem should be dealt with",
    ", it is important to understand what processes lead to the overmerging .",
    "several recent studies have addressed this question from different viewpoints and using different numerical and analytical techniques .",
    "thus , for example , van kampen ( 1995 ) studied formation of galaxy clusters in purely dissipationless simulations and concluded that two - body relaxation and tidal disruption are primarily responsible for the overmerging .",
    "he found , however , that the two - body effects are important only for the smallest halos ( @xmath17 dm particles ) , in quantitative agreement with experiments of moore et al .",
    "the latter study addressed also effects of particle - halo and halo - halo heating on the survival of dm halos .",
    "the authors concluded that particle - halo heating does not pose a problem as long as dm particle mass is @xmath18 , but halo - halo heating may be important if force resolution is not adequate ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the general conclusion of moore et al .",
    "is that the overmerging problem is due mainly to tidal heating by the cluster and halo - halo heating , both effects being enhanced by poor force resolution .",
    "they note also that these effects depend crucially on the density structure of dm halos .",
    "the density profile of dark matter halos in the cdm models is now known reasonably well .",
    "navarro , frenk & white ( 1995 , 1996 , 1997 , hereafter nfw ) gave an analytical fit that describes with a reasonable accuracy the density profiles of dm halos formed in the standard cold dark matter scenario over large range of scales and masses .",
    "the analytical form of the density profile advocated by nfw , allows one to estimate tidal effects and effects of dynamical friction analytically .",
    "we present these estimates in  2",
    ".    two recent numerical studies ( tormen , diaferio & syer 1998 ; and ghigna et al .",
    "1998 ) present evidence that higher resolution significantly aleviates the overmerging problem in dissipationless simulations .",
    "both studies conclude that many halos survive for a long time after falling onto a large halo , although overmerging problem persists to a certain degree in the central dense region of the large cluster - size halo .",
    "tormen et al . also point out that there are real physical processes which would lead to the erase of substructure even in the ideal very high - resolution simulation .",
    "namely , the dynamical friction drives massive satellites to the cluster core where they get tidally stripped and quickly disrupted .",
    "this effect is , of course , real and should be distinguished from artificial overmerging caused by insufficient numerical resolution .",
    "we will address these issues in  2 .",
    "two goals of the study presented in this paper are 1 ) to make an approximate estimates of the effects leading to the overmerging for the halos with the nfw density distribution ; and 2 ) to demonstrate that dissipationless simulations with sufficiently high resolution in force and mass are affected by the overmerging to a considerably lesser degree . in other words , we present an attempt to estimate to which extent the overmerging problem can be solved with numerical resolution that can be achieved with current codes and computational resources .",
    "the goal is worthwhile .",
    "if the problem can be minimized at a computational cost that is not prohibitive , the dissipationless simulations can be used for a direct study of the statistical properties of `` galaxies '' .",
    "this may include studies of their spatial distribution , velocity field , environmental effects etc .",
    "this may allow us to make a step towards solution of the long - standing and particularly important issue of the galactic bias .",
    "the overall plan of the paper is as follows . in  2 we discuss the numerical and physical effects which may lead to the erasure of substructure inside the dense massive halos .",
    "specifically , we present analytical estimates for tidal disruption of dark matter halos and effects of dynamical friction assuming that halos are described by the nfw density profile .",
    "we use these calculations to make a rough estimate of what resolution would be required to minimize the overmerging . numerical simulations and cosmological models",
    "are discussed in  3 . in ",
    "4 we discuss difficulties associated with identification of dark matter halos in very dense regions .",
    "we describe two new halo finding algorithms developed to handle the halos in such environments . in",
    " 5 we present results of high - resolution dissipationless simulations , illustrate the performance of the new halo finding algorithms and discuss the degree to which the simulations are affected by the overmerging .",
    "our conclusions are illustrated using well - known statistics such as two - point correlation function , velocity bias , luminosity function and @xmath20 ratio .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in  6 .",
    "as was noted in the introduction , there is a number of processes potentially contributing to the erasure of substructure in clusters and groups ( van kampen 1995 ; moore et al .",
    "some of these processes are due to numerical limitations of a simulation , while others are real physical effects .",
    "the major effects caused by numerical limitations are _ particle evaporation _ due to the two - body relaxation ( e.g. , carlberg 1994 ; van kampen 1995 ; moore et al .",
    "1996 ) , _ particle - halo heating _ ( carlberg 1994 ; moore et al .",
    "1996 ) , and _ premature tidal disruption _ due to an insufficient force resolution .",
    "the two - body evaporation in an @xmath0-body system is a well - understood process ( e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "however , it was shown ( van kampen 1995 ; moore et al .",
    "1996 ) that the two - body evaporation is important only for the halos with @xmath21 particles .",
    "thus , if a simulation has a particle mass of @xmath22 , this effect is not important for halos in the mass range of interest ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "it may become important , however , if halo looses most of its mass due to the tidal stripping .",
    "the particle - halo heating was suggested by carlberg ( 1994 ) as an explanation for overmerging in his simulation .",
    "however , moore et al . ( 1996 ) showed that the time - scale for this process is large for typical numerical parameters .",
    "finally , gravitational softening , @xmath24 , imposed in an @xmath0-body simulation usually leads to a constant density core @xmath25 in the halo center .",
    "poor force resolution may , thus , result in halos with artificially large cores which will be tidally disrupted faster than if they would have a more compact density distribution .",
    "the real physical processes which may lead to the erasure of substructure include _ dynamical friction _ ,",
    "_ tidal stripping _ , and _ halo - halo heating_. the dynamical friction drives dm halos towards the high - density cluster center where they get tidally stripped and merge with the central massive object .",
    "dynamical friction can be important for some halos and is probably responsible for the presence of massive central cd galaxies in observed clusters ( e.g. , merritt 1985 ) .",
    "the importance of dynamical friction for each particular halo will depend on the halo mass and details of its orbit .",
    "we will estimate these dependencies in  .",
    "tidal stripping occurs simply because at some distance from the center the tidal force from a cluster is stronger than gravitational force of a parent halo and particles beyond this radius become unbound from a halo and dissolve in the ambient diffuse medium .",
    "this effect will be discussed in the next section .",
    "finally , moore et al . ( 1996 ) argued that heating due to the close passages of dm halos on their orbits may lead to significant mass losses .",
    "their estimate , however , was based on experiment in which cluster is static . in real clusters only a few halos will be present for its entire lifetime , the bulk of the halos being accreted over period of the cluster evolution .",
    "this process is probably less important than the more efficient tidal stripping .",
    "numerical and physical effects are , of course , closely related .",
    "tidal force of the cluster and close encounters of individual dark halos result in effective stripping of the peripheral parts of the halos .",
    "this is a real physical effect .",
    "but after the stripping is done , two - body relaxation can become artificially short and can result in evaporation of halos if the number of particles in a halo is too small .",
    "due to the dynamical friction halos tend to spiral down towards the center of the cluster where they merge with the central halo .",
    "this is a real effect .",
    "but it can be exacerbated by artificially high energy dissipation in hydrodynamical simulations resulting in too compact halos .",
    "it is clear that physical processes will operate and will tend to erase substructure even in an ideal simulations of infinite resolution .",
    "the numerical effects , on the other hand , can be cured by improving the spatial and mass resolution of the simulations and/or by inclusion of additional physics ( e.g. , missing gas dissipation ) .",
    "it is the numerical effects that we will focus on in this paper . throughout the rest of the paper",
    ", we will be using the term `` overmerging problem '' only for processes related to the numerical effects , which appear due to the lack of resolution or due to missing physical effects .",
    "the main reason for the erasure of the substructure in clusters is the tidal interaction of individual halos with the cluster potential .",
    "this can be now estimated reliably , without assuming that halos are isothermal spheres or have king profiles , as was typically the case in the past ( moore et al .",
    "the density profiles of dark matter halos in the cdm models is now known reasonably well for a large range of masses and for a variety of cosmological models ( nfw ) .",
    "below we give analytic estimates for various halo properties in the standard @xmath26 cdm model . the low - density flat cdm model with cosmological constant ( @xmath27cdm ; e.g. , carrol , press & turner 1992 ) model predicts similar profiles , if the the overdensity of a collapsed object is adjusted properly to take into account the change in @xmath28 ( lahav et al .",

    "1996 ) .",

    "note that our definition of @xmath33 differs from that used by nfw , who use @xmath40 for all cosmological models .",

    "using these definitions we can write mass @xmath48 , orbital frequency @xmath49 , and gravitational potential @xmath50 : @xmath51 in some cases it is more convenient to define properties of halos by using maximum rotational velocity @xmath52 , halo parameter which is probably most easily related to an observable quantity , instead of the concentration @xmath34 or the virial mass @xmath32 . for profile",
    "( ) the maximum of the rotational velocity occurs at @xmath53 .",
    "this gives @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the escape velocity at the distance @xmath56 from the cluster center .",
    "the tidal radius , @xmath57 , of a small halo with mass @xmath58 and maximum rotational velocity @xmath59 moving at a radius @xmath60 from the center of a large halo with mass @xmath61 and @xmath62 , is the minimum of two radii : ( 1 ) a radius at which the gravity force of the small halo @xmath63 is equal to the tidal force of the large halo @xmath64 , and ( 2 ) a radius defined by the resonances between the force the small halo exerts on the particle and the tidal force by the large halo . if @xmath56 is the distance of a particle from the center of the small halo , then the condition @xmath65 gives an equation for the tidal radius @xmath57 :    @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the last equation can be solved numerically .",

    "this leads to the following equation for the tidal radius : @xmath71 we take the smaller of the two estimates of @xmath57 .",

    "the mass of a dark halo , indicated next to each curve , is the virial mass of the unstripped halo , i.e. mass _ before _ the halo entered the cluster .",
    "as the distance from the cluster center decreases , the tidal radius of the halo and the mass within the tidal radius decrease accordingly . even at large distances from the cluster center ( @xmath77 ) the halo radius changes significantly .",
    "for example , a halo with @xmath45 and @xmath78 at @xmath79 from the center of @xmath73 group lost only 20% of its original mass , but its radius decreased by a factor of two .",
    "the mass inside the tidal radius @xmath80 changes with @xmath60 much slower @xmath81 than it would for the isothermal distribution for which we expect @xmath82 .",
    "this is because the halos with profile eq .",
    "( ) are more centrally concentrated @xmath83 than isothermal halos ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "note that the central cusp in eq .",
    "( ) is not important for survival of halos at large distances : @xmath30 is smaller than the tidal radius @xmath57 . at smaller distances ( @xmath85 ) mass within the tidal radius decreases faster ( @xmath82 ) and",
    "the orbital - internal resonance defines the tidal stripping .",
    "it is likely that we overestimate the effect of tidal destruction at these distances as compared to galaxies in real clusters because the tidal radius is small @xmath86 and the baryonic component can not be neglected . at the same time , whether halos survive or not , they already have lost a very large fraction of their mass ( @xmath87 , exact number depends on parameters of the halo ) when they get to @xmath88 .",
    "baryonic matter can loose energy by emitting radiation .",
    "this dissipation allows baryons to sink onto the centers of halos and produce a dense central region inside parent dark matter halo .",
    "because a denser halo is more resistant to the tidal disruption , baryon dissipation clearly helps galaxies to survive in clusters .",
    "we consider two effects due to the energy dissipation .",
    "( i ) the shape of the density profile in the central part of the halo changes without changing much overall structure of the halo .",
    "( ii ) global parameters of the halo ( such as its characteristic radius @xmath89 and maximum rotational velocity @xmath62 ) change in reaction to the motion of baryons into the center .",
    "another possible effect is orbit circularization due to formation of rotationally supported baryonic disk .",
    "the effect of this last process , however , is difficult to estimate , but it likely affects only baryons .",
    "below we discuss the first two effects .",
    "\\(i ) _ the shape of the density profile in the halo center . _",
    "the main question here is how much our estimates of the tidal radius would change if we assumed a steeper central cusp .    to get an estimate of the effect",
    ", we assume that sinking of the baryons to the halo center produces flat rotation curve : @xmath90constant , @xmath91 . for simplicity",
    ", the rotational velocity is assumed to be equal to the maximum of the circular velocity of the dm halo before the dissipation .",
    "figure shows tidal radii of halos of different masses and circular velocities inside a cluster of mass @xmath75 .",
    "isothermal halos have larger tidal radii , which means that they are more stable .",
    "nevertheless , the difference with the nfw halos is very small at distances from cluster center larger than @xmath92 .",
    "even at @xmath93 the the difference is only 10%-20% .",
    "the dotted curve in this plot shows the distance at which the tidal radius is equal to the characteristic radius @xmath89 of the satellite halos . at this distance",
    "the tidal radius of the isothermal halos is @xmath94 larger than tidal radius of the nfw halos .",
    "our @xmath0-body simulations presented in the next section indicate that halos which come that close to the center of a cluster will be tidally destroyed regardless of what resolution is used .",
    "they may leave a very small leftover , which , even if present , is so small that it can not represent a galaxy .",
    "thus , the change in the shape of the central density profile can not significantly affect survival of halos inside clusters .",
    "\\(ii ) _ increase of the central density due to",
    "dissipation_. the next question is what effect for halo survival can have possible increase of the central density ( and hence maximum rotational velocity ) due to the baryonic dissipation .",
    "again , we assume that the halo after the dissipation has a flat rotation curve and , thus , its tidal radius can be roughly estimated using isothermal density profile . in figure the halo `` moves '' from the nfw curve ( dashed line ) to a higher isothermal curve ( solid line ) .",
    "for example , a dm halo with the virial mass of @xmath95 with tidal radius of @xmath96 at @xmath97 from the cluster center can increase its tidal radius to @xmath98 , if its circular velocity increases from @xmath99 to @xmath100 .",
    "this may save the halo from the tidal destruction because its tidal radius is now about twice larger than its @xmath89 . unfortunately , there are limits on the increase of the rotational velocity .",
    "the gas possesses non - zero angular momentum , characterized by the dimensionless spin parameter @xmath101 ( binney & tremain 1987 ) and sooner or later becomes rotationally supported . for a typical value of @xmath102 ,",
    "the adiabatical infall model ( e.g. , mo , mao , & white 1998 ) predicts an increase of the maximum rotational velocity of @xmath103 .",
    "( we use eqs .",
    "33 - 34 in mo , mao , & white with the fraction of mass in disk @xmath104 ; a correction is made to convert from @xmath105 to @xmath62 ) . using a different approach to treat the baryonic infall , avila - reese , firmani , & hernandez ( 1998 ) arrive at the same correction : rotational velocity increases by a factor 1.3 - 1.4 for typical halo parameters .",
    "figure shows that such increase would correspond to @xmath106 increase in the tidal radius .",
    "while the energy dissipation and subsequent baryonic infall increase the tidal radius , it is hardly a dramatic effect for realistic halos .      up to this point",
    "we have treated the tidal stripping in a rather simplified way .",
    "such simplified treatment is useful , because it gives a rough approximation for a complicated process . in reality ( even within the framework of dark matter dynamics ) , the situation is more complicated .",
    "this is especially true for halos that loose a significant fraction of mass , in which case stability of the halos against the two - body relaxation is an issue . when a halo looses mass , the mass is lost from peripheral parts .",
    "if the trajectories of particles are not circular ( which is typically the case ) , the central region of the halo will start to `` feel '' the loss on a dynamical time - scale .",
    "some of particles leave the center and are not replaced by tidally - stripped particles ; this decreases the central density and leads to the expansion of the halo and to further loss of mass .",
    "the cycle may repeat , destroying eventually the entire halo . whether this process leads to halo destruction or not depends on the orbit of the halo and its tidal radius .    in order to study the tidal stripping in a more realistic way",

    "if the force resolution is not sufficient , the halo is lost . for example , with the force resolution of @xmath131 the halo is lost after 4gyr . increasing the force resolution helps the halo to survive , but once a threshold of @xmath132 is reached , additional increase in resolution does not change the mass of bound particles , which indicates convergence of the results .",

    "the dynamical friction time decreases as the halo moves into the cluster because the density of cluster increases .",
    "note , however , that this decrease is countered by the halo mass decrease due to the tidal stripping .",
    "the dynamical friction time is thus a varying quantity which depends on the cluster mass , distance from the cluster center , and halo s gravitationally bound mass .",
    "we should note that equation should be considered as a rough estimate of the effect for at least two reasons .",
    "first , we assume for simplicity that orbits are circular , which , of course , is a very simplified view of the real halo orbits in clusters .",
    "this simplification , however , makes it possible to estimate all the interesting quantities analytically and thus greatly facilitates computations of dynamical evolution .",
    "there is very little data as to what kinds of orbits are to be expected ( see , however , recent work of van den bosch et al . 1998 ) .",
    "recent numerical studies by tormen ( 1997 ) , tormen et al ( 1998 ) , and ghigna et al .",
    "( 1998 ) give somewhat different accounts on the distribution of the orbital parameters .",
    "tormen ( 1997 ) concludes that orbits are neither radial nor circular and that the average eccentricity of the orbits is @xmath159 , while orbits in cluster analyzed by ghigna et al .",
    "( 1998 ) are reported to be mostly radial .",
    "it is not clear at present what causes the difference .",
    "importance of the dynamical friction for a particular halo will depend on the halo s orbit .",
    "halos on circular or low - eccentricity orbits with large radius will experience little gravitational drag and would never come close to the center and get tidally disrupted . on an eccentric orbit , some of these objects would have a chance to pass though the dense cluster core where the tidal effects discussed in the previous section ( and gravitational drag too ) would be considerably stronger .",
    "note , however , that the time spent by a halo on highly eccentric orbit near the orbit pericenter is rather small .",
    "the strong tidal force in the cluster center will shock the halo during pericenter passages , but for most of its orbit the halo will exist in less dense ( and thus more favorable for its survival ) environments .",
    "the worst evolution scenario can be envisioned for a halo on a low - eccentricity orbit with a small radius .",
    "such halo will suffer both strong and continuous tidal losses and fast decay of the orbital radius due to the dynamical friction .",
    "the validity of the chandrasekhar s formula in spherically symmetric , finite - size systems was also a subject of extensive debate over the years .",
    "one obvious drawback of this equation is that it does not predict a drag experienced by a satellite on an orbit outside of the spherical system ( e.g. , lin & tremaine 1983 ) .",
    "most studies , however , indicate that the equation works remarkably well .",
    "lin & tremaine ( 1983 ) , for example , have addressed the subject numerically and have found that eq",
    ". works well for satellites of mass @xmath160 of the primary .",
    "the same conclusion was reached in other numerical studies ( bontekoe & van albada 1987 ; zaritsky & white 1988 ; or more recently , cora et al .",
    "analytical study by weinberg ( 1986 ) , in which chandrasekhar s formula was rederived for spherically symmetric potential , also shows that this formalism is applicable in most cases .",
    "recent analytical studies by bekenstein & maoz ( 1992 ) , maoz ( 1993 ) , and domnguez - tenreiro & gmez - flechoso ( 1998 ) used fluctuation - dissipation approach to derive the energy losses due to the gravitational drag . despite the more sophisticated treatment and inclusion of the various important details ( satellite s size , not negligible mass of the background particles , inner velocity structure of satellite ) , it appears that chandrasekhar s formula gives a good approximation for the energy losses .",
    "domnguez - tenreiro & gmez - flechoso ( 1998 ) , for example , have taken into account both the finite size of the satellite and the internal velocity structure of the satellite .",
    "their analysis shows that if internal velocity dispersion of the satellite is @xmath161 of the velocity dispersion of the primary system ( always the case in our study of massive clusters ) the energy losses predicted by chandrasekhar s formula are accurate to within @xmath162 .",
    "there is , of course , a considerably larger uncertainty caused by the choice of the coulomb logarithm , because there is no general prescription of how to estimate the minimum and maximum impact parameters .",
    "the value of the coulomb logarithm in clusters of galaxies is expected to be @xmath163 .",
    "the value of @xmath164 was used in a recent study by tormen et al .",

    "they showed that even when @xmath165 is kept constant the chandrasekhar s formula works remarkably well , predicting quite accurately decay of the satellite s orbital radius for the satellites as massive as @xmath166 of the cluster mass .",
    "this latter test is most relevant to our study and shows that use of the eq .",
    "is justified .",
    "the dynamical friction time as a function of the distance to the cluster center for a variety of cluster and satellite masses is shown in figure .",
    "in general , the results are hardly surprising .",

    "the friction time is short as compared with the hubble time .",
    "adding the baryons would only shorten the friction time , as more mass would be retained within the halo s tidal radius .",
    "if a group exists for a sufficiently long time and does not accrete efficiently new satellites , the dynamical friction would produce an object that would look like an overmerger  a giant central galaxy with no other galaxies in the group .",
    "the epoch of formation and the growth rate of groups depends on the parameters of a cosmological model .",

    "7. the dynamical friction time for different masses of clusters and halos .",
    "for a given halo the dynamical friction time decreases as the halo moves into the cluster because the density of cluster increases .",
    "but then the halo starts to lose its mass , and the friction time increases again .",
    "the set of virial masses is the same as in figure .",
    "the horizontal dashed line shows the hubble time for this cosmological model .",
    "a matter of concern is how one could distinguish between numerical and physical effects as the primary cause of overmerging .",
    "there may be two approaches to this problem .",
    "first , one can estimate the required resolution in the manner outlined in the next section and run a simulation .",
    "after that run another simulation with considerably higher resolution . such a test may be prohibitive in terms of the cpu time required to run the very high - resolution run .",
    "however , it is probably the most certain way of testing for the numerical effects .",
    "high - resolution simulations of individual clusters are probably best suited for this kind of test .",
    "indeed , a similar test was attempted by ghigna et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who analyzed two runs of the same clusters with different spatial resolutions .",
    "the second possible solution is to identify cluster s progenitor at an earlier epoch ( e.g. , @xmath169 ) and follow evolution of a sample of test halos in the representative mass range .",
    "this analysis may show what mechanism is really at work ( e.g. , dynamical friction may be clearly observed in the orbit decay ) and may allow one to estimate whether the numerical resolution is adequate .",
    "numerical experiments presented by moore et al .",
    "( 1996 ) show that halos become unstable and get quickly disrupted if tidal radius is smaller than @xmath170 times the core radius .",
    "the force softening , @xmath24 , usually has effect of creating an artificial core in the density distribution at scales @xmath171 .",
    "thus , it can be assumed ( optimistically ) that halos get disrupted if @xmath172 .",
    "the details of the tidal stripping will , of course , depend non - trivially on the mass and orbital parameters of halo .",
    "however , tidal radius for a halo can be approximately defined ( johnston 1998 ; ghigna et al .",
    "1998 ) as the tidal radius defined by equations at the pericenter of the halo orbit .",
    "numerical studies of satellite dynamics ( e.g. , johnston , hernquist & bolte 1996 ) indicate also that @xmath173 mass loss can be expected at every pericentric passage , which agrees well with results of our numerical experiments .",
    "this will have an additional effect if halo orbits long enough to make several pericentric passages .",
    "thus , with an adequate mass resolution , dark matter halos should survive ( at least during the first period of their orbit ) inside groups of galaxies as long as their pericentric @xmath57 is twice or larger than the force resolution .",
    "these halos may lose a large fraction of their mass , but they should be able to retain their identity even without the additional baryonic dissipation .",
    "if the required force resolution can not be achieved , the baryons need to be included to alleviate the problem .",
    "ultimately , survival of a particular halo will depend on both the mass and the force resolution . in order for two - body evaporation to be negligible",
    ", halos must contain @xmath174 particles .",
    "this will define the mass limit for the surviving halos even if the force resolution is sufficiently high .",
    "a very optimistic estimate , thus , would be that a halo should consist of at least @xmath175 particles and its tidal radius should be larger than two resolution elements .",
    "as an example , we consider a rather typical simulation with particle mass of @xmath176 and the resolution of @xmath177 ( e.g. , gelb & bertschinger 1994 ; ma & bertschinger 1995 ; tormen 1997 ) . with this resolution",
    "one would naively hope to find @xmath178 satellites ",
    "the virial radius of a halo with this mass is more than twice larger than the force resolution .",
    "the top panel in figure ( b )   indicates , however , that halos of this initial virial mass can not be found inside a cluster of mass @xmath74 : due to the insufficient mass resolution they lose so much of their mass that they are destroyed by the tidal force",
    ". the mass resolution of these simulations was sufficient to find what is left of a halo with @xmath179 at distances @xmath180 .",
    "however , the bottom panel in fig .",
    "( b ) shows that tidal radius for galaxy - size halos is smaller than two resolution elements within central @xmath181 and thus no such halos should be expected there .",
    "therefore , lack of the force resolution resulted in erasure ( `` overmerging '' ) of even fairly massive ( @xmath182 ) halos within the @xmath130 .",
    "but even a considerably better resolution may not be sufficient if we deal with a really massive cluster .",
    "for example , carlberg ( 1994 ) simulated a @xmath183 cluster with mass resolution of @xmath184 and the plummer force softening of @xmath185 . according to gelb & bertschinger ( 1994 ) ,",
    "the effective resolution for the plummer force is @xmath186 .",
    "this gives the resolution @xmath187 , which we use as a limit on the tidal radius of resolved halos .",
    "analysis of tidal radii for a cluster of this mass shows that due to the insufficient force resolution , no halos should exist at distances smaller than @xmath188 .",
    "halos of mass @xmath189 should be tidally destroyed at @xmath190 .",
    "this is consistent with what carlberg ( 1994 ) found in his simulation .",
    "what resolution is required for halos to survive ?",
    "the above examples show that the answer depends on the mass of the cluster and on the mass of the halo one would like to resolve",
    ". the force resolution should be ( significantly ) smaller than the minimal tidal radius of a halo ( defined by the orbit s pericenter ) . for a @xmath74 cluster",
    "the tidal radius for a massive halo of mass @xmath191 at a distance of @xmath192 is @xmath193 .",
    "the force resolution should probably be better than @xmath194 for such halo to survive in the cluster . because the halo at this distance loses 80%90% of its original virial mass , and",
    "because realistically one needs at least 2030 particles to identify a halo , the particle mass should be smaller than @xmath195 .",
    "these estimates may be optimistic for halos that orbit in cluster for several periods due to continuing mass loss ( see  2.2 ) and possible effects of halo - halo heating ( moore et al .",
    "1996 ) .    to some extent",
    ", the answer is clear . in order to allow a galaxy - size halo to survive ,",
    "the force resolution must be much smaller than its tidal radius and the halo must be represented by many particles . for a typical large galaxy of the mass @xmath196 and tidal radius of @xmath197 in a @xmath198 cluster ,",
    "the resolution must be of @xmath199 and particle mass  @xmath200 .",
    "there is a number of further caveats related to analysis of the halo remnants .",
    "the most important of them is the question of whether it is possible to recover properties of the original halo from the properties of the remnant .",
    "unfortunately , the answer to this question is not clear and various parameters may be affected in different and complicated ways .",
    "most of the the halos orbit in cluster for periods less then 10  gyrs , and although their peripheral parts are being stripped , the evolution of the central regions is not dramatic ( see fig . ) .",
    "we simulate the evolution of @xmath201 cold dark matter particles in two cosmological models : a flat low - matter density cdm model with cosmological constant ( @xmath27cdm ; @xmath109 ; @xmath110 ; @xmath111 ) and a model with a mixture of cold and hot dark matter ( chdm ; @xmath202 ; @xmath203 ; @xmath204 ; @xmath205 ) .",

    "second , the code reaches its peak resolution in the highest density regions inside virial radius of the dm halos . to resolve a halo , we need at least @xmath227 resolution elements per halo size , which justifies the dynamic range of @xmath228",

    "`` did the halo that we find at present exist at an earlier time ? '' .",
    "thus , we supplement our hierarchical fof algorithm with an algorithm which checks if halos existed at previous moments .",

    "however , the attractive simplicity of this algorithm makes it worth in looking for ways of improving it .",
    "we will discuss our improvements to such an algorithm in  .",

    "\\1 . _ a large galaxy with a small satellite . _",
    "examples : the lmc and the milky way or the m51 system . assuming that the satellite is bound",
    ", do we have to include the mass of the satellite in the mass of the large galaxy ?",
    "if we do , then we count mass of the satellite twice : once when we find the satellite and then when we find the large galaxy .",
    "this does not seem reasonable .",
    "if we do not include the satellite , then the mass of the large galaxy is underestimated .",
    "for example , the binding energy of a particle at the distance of the satellite will be wrong .",
    "the problem arises when we try to assign particles to different halos in the effort to find masses of halos .",
    "this is very difficult to do for particles moving between halos .",
    "even if a particle at some moment has negative energy relative to one of the halos , it is not guaranteed that it belongs to the halo .",
    "the gravitational potential changes with time , and the particle may end up falling onto another halo .",
    "this is not just a precaution .",
    "this actually was found very often in real halos when we compared contents of halos at different redshifts .",
    "interacting halos exchange mass and lose mass .",
    "we try to avoid the situation : instead of assigning mass to halos , we find the maximum circular velocity , @xmath232 , which is a more meaningful quantity than mass from observational point of view .",
    "\\2 . _ a satellite of a large galaxy . _",
    "the previous situation is now viewed from a different angle .",
    "how can we estimate the mass or the rotational velocity of the satellite ?",
    "the formal virial radius of the satellite is large : it coincides with the virial radius of the host halo . in order to find the outer radius of the satellite , we analyze the density profile . at small distances from the center of the satellite",
    "the density steeply declines but then it flattens out and may even increase .",
    "this means that we reached the outer boundary of the satellite .",
    "we use the radius at which the density starts to flatten out as the first approximation for the radius of the halo .",
    "this approximation can be improved by removing unbound particles and checking the steepness of the density profile in the outer part .",
    "_ tidal stripping .",
    "_ this is not a numerical effect and is not due to a `` lack of physics '' .",
    "very likely this is what happens to real galaxies in clusters .",
    "their peripheral parts , responsible for extended flat rotation curves outside of clusters , are lost when the galaxies fall into a cluster .",
    "thus , if an algorithm finds that 90% of mass of a halo identified at early epoch is lost , it does not mean that the halo was destroyed . this is a normal situation . what is left , given that it still has a large enough mass and radius , is a galaxy halo .",
    "in order to find substructures at vastly different overdensities , we use hierarchical friends - of - friends algorithm ( hfof ) .",
    "this algorithm simply applies the fof algorithm with a set of different ( hierarchical ) linking lengths . in our analysis",
    "we use 4 hierarchical levels , in which case the set consists of linking lengths starting from the small value @xmath233 and larger values obtained by doubling this value : @xmath234 , @xmath235 , and @xmath236 .",
    "we call @xmath237 the lowest ( with respect to the corresponding overdensity threshold ) level and @xmath238 the highest level",

    "typical examples would be either a `` bridge '' connecting two particle clusters or small satellite clusters on highly eccentric orbit that move temporarily beyond the virial radius of a massive halo .",
    "therefore , one must check the stability of every identified halo candidate . the easiest way to make such",
    "a check is to find whether a given halo candidate exists at an earlier moment .",

    ", there is little difference in the number of identified halos using thresholds of 30% and 50% .",

    "it appears thus that mass - to - light ratio of galaxy groups of mass @xmath295 is not a very good indicator of the total matter density in the universe .",
    "several authors have suggested a possible existence of the velocity bias @xmath296 : systematic difference between rms velocities of galaxies and dark matter particles ( carlberg , couchman & thomas 1990 ; carlberg 1994 ; colafrancesco , antonuccio - delogu & del popolo 1995 ) .",

    "absolute values of the correlation functions are affected by the finite box size .",
    "unfortunately , even in the case of sufficient resolution , when halos do survive , the identification of the dm halos in the cores of galaxy groups and clusters in purely dissipationless simulations remains a challenge . in the environments that dense ,",
    "most of halo s dark matter will be be tidally stripped , which makes it difficult to identify the leftover on the very dense , smooth background of high - velocity dark matter particles streaming around and through the halo .",
    "we have presented two new halo finding algorithms designed to identify satellite halos located inside the virial radius of a more massive host halo : the hierarchical friends - of - friends and bound density maxima algorithms .",
    "both of our algorithms find practically the same halos , which are stable ( existed at previous moments ) and gravitationally bound .",
    "to exploit the fact that overmerging is ( at least to a certain degree ) `` beaten '' in our simulation , we consider several statistics of galaxy - size halos in our simulations and compare them to the corresponding observed statistics of galaxies .",
    "we use a simple scheme , based on the empirical tully - fisher relation , to assign a luminosity to the dm halos . the luminosity function of `` galaxies '' ( i.e.",
    ", galaxy - size halos assigned a luminosity ) in the @xmath27cdm model reproduces the luminosity function of the cfa catalog ( marzke et al .",
    "1994 ) reasonably well .",
    "both the simulations and the cfa catalog have an upturn in the number of faint galaxies ( @xmath320 ) .",
    "however , magnitudes of faint `` galaxies '' in the simulations rely on a highly uncertain extrapolation of the tully - fisher relation and on uncertain assumption about the fraction of elliptical galaxies at these magnitudes .",
    "the number of `` galaxies '' predicted by the chdm simulation is significantly higher than in the case of the @xmath27cdm simulation with the same initial random numbers .",
    "we failed to produce as nice a fit to the observational data as for the @xmath27cdm simulation . at this stage",
    "it is difficult to judge if this is a significant problem for the model or not . due to the small size of our simulation boxes",
    ", one may argue that simulations with a large box will tend to produce lower luminosity function keeping at the same time the m / l of galaxy groups intact .",
    "larger simulations are needed to clarify the situation .",
    "the mass - to - light ratios of galaxy groups in the simulations @xmath321 match those observed reasonably well .",
    "it was argued ( e.g. , bahcall , lubin , & dorman 1995 ) that dynamics of galaxy groups favors the low-@xmath28 universe .",
    "our results show that mass - to - light ratios of groups of mass @xmath322 is insensitive to the matter density .",
    "the halos in the chdm model are clustered more strongly than the dark matter and one can not save the argument for a low-@xmath28 universe by assuming that groups in the chdm model have too large fraction of galaxies .",
    "it seems that groups occupy too small fraction of the volume and thus their m / l ratios are not representative for the universe as a whole .",
    "comparison of the halo and matter correlation functions indicates that halos are antibiased on 100  kpc",
    " 1  mpc scales .",
    "the antibias of the magnitude 0.70.9 found in the simulations is needed for the @xmath27cdm model to be compatible with observational data on the power spectrum in the range of wavenumbers @xmath309 ( klypin et al .",
    "1996 ; smith et al .",
    "we attribute the antibias to the dynamical friction in groups of galaxies .",
    "the friction tends to drag some galaxies to the very central part of groups where they merge the central galaxy and disappear ( see kravtsov & klypin 1999 for a more detailed analysis ) .",
    "results of this paper can be used in design of the future numerical simulations .",
    "we have shown that efficient halo finding algorithms can be developed to identify gravitationally bound satellite halos inside the virial radius of the other halos .",
    "our analytical estimates and numerical experiments show that the numerical resolution required to overcome the overmerging , although quite high , can be achieved with current numerical codes and computer hardware .",
    "the main challenge is thus purely computational .",
    "this is also true for the simulations that include dissipative hydrodynamics ; while alleviating or obliterating some of the problems of dissipationless simulations , they are computationally more intensive .",
    "both numerical approaches have a number of caveats and potential biases , which could only be avoided with inclusion of more realistic physics .",
    "the latter appears to be unavoidable , because we can not reliably predict observed galaxy properties ( and hence mimick the selection criteria of the observational catalogs ) without realistic physics .",
    "fast increase in computational capability of modern computers and recent developments of new efficient numerical algorithms make the perspective for advances in this direction look good .",
