    "blazars are a sub - category of active galactic nuclei where a relativistic jet pointing close to our line of sight produces doppler - boosted emission ( e.g. , urry & padovani 1995 ; ulrich , maraschi & urry 1997 ) .",
    "generally , their overall spectra have two pronounced continuum components : one peaking between ir and x - rays is produced by the synchrotron radiation of relativistic electrons , and the other in the @xmath12-ray regime , presumably due to the inverse compton ( ic ) emission by the same electrons . in some cases ,",
    "@xmath12-ray emission is seen to extend to the tev range ; the x - ray and gev / tev @xmath12-ray bands correspond to the highest energy ends ( @xmath13 ) of the synchrotron / ic emission ( e.g. , inoue & takahara 1996 ; kirk , rieger & mastichiadis 1998 ) . at these ends",
    ", variability is expected to be most pronounced , and in fact , such large flux variations are observed , on a timescale of hours to days ( e.g. , kataoka et al . 2001 ; tanihata et al .",
    "2001 ) or even shorter ( minutes scale ; aharonian et al . 2007 ; albert et al . 2007 ) .",
    "using @xmath14 data , takahashi et al .",
    "( 1996 ) argued the soft x - ray ( @xmath15 1 kev ) variation of mrk  421 , observed to lag behind that of the hard x - rays ( @xmath16 2 kev ) by @xmath2 4 ks , may well be ascribed to the energy dependence of the synchrotron cooling timescale .",
    "more recently , kataoka et al . ( 2000 ) interpreted an observed soft - lag and spectral evolution of pks  2155 - 304 by a newly developed time - dependent synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) model .    the above @xmath17 of `` soft - lag ''",
    "was questioned , however , in several aspects .",
    "first , intensive x - ray monitoring of blazars has revealed not only soft lags but in some cases hard lags ( takahashi et al . 2000 ) which may be a manifestation of another process , e.g. , energy dependent acceleration .",
    "second , edelson et al . ( 2001 ) voiced concerns about reliability of measurement of lags that are smaller than the orbital periods ( @xmath2 6 ks ) of low earth orbit satellites .",
    "this was refuted by tanihata et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and zhang et al .",
    "( 2004 ) who showed that , although periodic gaps introduce larger uncertainties than evenly sampled data , lags on hour - scale can not be the result of periodic gaps .",
    "a time resolved cross correlation analysis of uninterrupted mrk  421 data obtained by xmm - newton revealed lags of both signs , changing on time scales of up to a few 10@xmath18 s ( brinkmann et al . 2005 ) .",
    "hence the situation is very complex and still under debate .    in this letter",
    "we present new results from the may 2006 @xmath0 observation of 1es  1218 + 304 conducted as part of a multi - wavelength campaign with kva-@xmath19-magic .",
    "1es  1218 + 304 is categorized as a high - frequency peaked bl lac object , at a redshift @xmath20 ( veron - cetty & veron 2003 ) .",
    "it was discovered as a tev emitter by magic at energies @xmath21 gev ( albert et al .",
    "2006 ) and subsequently confirmed by veritas ( fortin 2007 ) . while the detailed multiband analysis is ongoing , we focus in this letter on a remarkable x - ray flare observed with @xmath0 .",
    "we present temporal and spectral features in @xmath22 3 , in @xmath22 4 we discuss a physical origin of temporal variability .",
    "1es  1218 + 304 was observed with @xmath0 ( mitsuda et al .",
    "2007 ) during 2006 may 20@xmath121 ut , yielding a net exposure time of 79.9 ks .",
    "@xmath0 carries four sets of x - ray telescopes ( serlemitsos et al .",
    "2007 ) each with a focal - plane x - ray ccd camera ( xis , x - ray imaging spectrometer ; koyama et al . 2007 ) that is sensitive over the 0.3 - 12 kev band , together with a non - imaging hard x - ray detector ( hxd ; takahashi et al . 2007 ; kokubun et al . 2007 ) , which covers the 10 - 600 kev energy band with si pin photo - diodes and gso scintillation detectors .",
    "1es  1218 + 304 was focused on the nominal center position of the hxd detector .    for the xis , we analyzed the screened data , reduced via @xmath0 software version 2.0 .",
    "the screening was based on the following criteria : ( 1 ) only asca - grade 0,2,3,4,6 events were accumulated , while hot and flickering pixels were removed using the cleansis script , ( 2 ) the time interval after the passage of south atlantic anomaly is greater than 500 s , ( 3 ) the object is at least 5@xmath23 and 20@xmath23 above the rim of the earth ( elv ) during night and day , respectively .",
    "in addition , we also select the data with a cutoff rigidity ( cor ) larger than 6 gv . after this screening ,",
    "the net exposure for good time intervals is 69.4 ks .",
    "the xis events were extracted from a circular region with a radius of 4.2@xmath24 centered on the source peak , whereas the background was accumulated in an annulus with inner and outer radii of 5.4@xmath24 and 7.3@xmath24 , respectively .",
    "we checked that the use of different source and background regions did not affect the analysis results .",
    "the response and auxiliary files are produced using the analysis tools xisrmfgen and xissimarfgen developed by the @xmath0 team , which are included in the software package heasoft version 6.4 .",
    "the hxd / pin data ( version 2.0 ) were processed with basically the same screening criteria as those for the xis , except that elv@xmath165@xmath23 through night and day and cor@xmath168gv .",
    "the hxd / pin instrumental background spectra were provided by the hxd team for each observation ( kokubun et al .",
    "2007 ; fukazawa et al . 2006 ) .",
    "both the source and background spectra were made with identical good time intervals and the exposure was corrected for detector deadtime of 6.0% .",
    "we used the response files version ae_hxd_pinhxdnom2_20070914.rsp , provided by the hxd team .",
    "figure [ fig : lc ] shows the averaged light curves of the four xiss in the six x - ray energy bands . although we could see variations of count rates at some level using hxd / pin data , it was not significant within uncertainties of photon statistics .",
    "thus in the following , we concentrate on the temporal variability of the xis data only , below 10 kev .",
    "the temporal variation of the hardness ratio ( hr ) is also shown in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : lc ] .",
    "it indicates that the variability in the soft and hard x - ray bands are @xmath25 well synchronized .    to quantify the different shape of the flare with energy dependent time - lags , we fitted the light curves with a function given by norris ( 1996 ) after a slight modification of adding a constant offset @xmath26 to mimic the observed light curves : @xmath27 \\hspace*{0.2 cm } ( { \\rm for } \\hspace*{0.1 cm } t \\leq t_{\\rm peak}),\\\\       & = & c_0 + c_1 \\times \\exp [ -(|t - t_{\\rm peak}/\\sigma_{\\rm d}|)^{k } ] \\hspace*{0.2 cm } ( { \\rm for } \\hspace*{0.1 cm } t > t_{\\rm peak}),\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the time of the flare s maximum intensity @xmath29 , @xmath30 is a measure of pulse sharpness , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the rise and decay time constants .",
    "if the light curve is symmetric in time , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are expected to be equal .",
    "all the light curves were binned at 2880 s ( a half of the orbital period of @xmath0 ) for fitting .",
    "the results of the fittings are given in table [ table : pulsefit ] .",
    "in summary , the observed flare shows the following characteristics : ( 1 ) the flare shape is asymmetric in time ( @xmath33 ) especially in the lower energy band ( but note @xmath34 @xmath35 1 for 5@xmath110 kev light curve ) .",
    "( 2 ) the flare amplitude defined as @xmath36 becomes larger as the photon energy increases ( the 5@xmath110 kev flux changed by a factor of @xmath22 ) .",
    "( 3 ) the rise - time of the flare is almost constant @xmath37 s below 2 kev , while it becomes gradually longer at higher energy bands .",
    "next , we try to evaluate lags of temporal variations in various energy bands . taking into account a wide variety of the flare shape measured at different energies , we estimated lags by just comparing the peak - time of the flare rather than using other temporal techniques , such as the discrete correlation function ( dcf ; edelson & krolik 1989 ) or the modified mean deviation method ( mmd ; hufnagel & bregman 1992 ) .",
    "we compared the peak - time in five lower energy bands to that determined in the 5@xmath110 kev band .",
    "apparently , the hard x - ray ( 5@xmath110 kev ) peak lagged behind that in the soft x - ray ( 0.3@xmath11 kev ) by ( 2.3@xmath380.7)@xmath310@xmath4 s. importantly , this is much larger than the orbital period of @xmath0 and less affected by artifacts proposed in edelson et al .",

    "we also tried to fit with a broken power - law model with galactic absorption .",
    "the photon index below the break energy @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) is @xmath48 while the index above @xmath46 is @xmath49 , where @xmath46 ( @xmath50 ) is @xmath51 kev . the flux over 2 - 10 kev is @xmath52 erg @xmath41 s@xmath42 .",
    "this model gives a better fit with a reduced @xmath45 of 1.14 for 1959 dof compared to the single power - law model , but @xmath45 is still not acceptable .",
    "considering the spectral variability , we analyzed the spectrum every 5760 s. the power - law indices vary from @xmath53 to @xmath54 during the flare , and each segment can be fitted well with a single power - law model or broken power - law model with @xmath45/dof ranging from 0.94 to 1.09 .    figure [ fig : sed ] shows the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of 1es  1218 + 304 with currently available datasets .",

    "note that the tev analysis of multi - wavelength campaign data is still ongoing and the combined datasets will be investigated in forthcoming paper ( stefan et al . in prep ) .",
    "as expected from the curved x - ray spectrum with photon index @xmath55 around 2 and @xmath56 kev , the synchrotron emission peaks just around the @xmath0 bandpass .    in order to specify the sed of 1es  1218 + 304",
    ", we applied a one - zone homogeneous ssc model developed in kataoka et al .",
    "noting that the characteristic variability time scale of the flare is @xmath39 @xmath35 5@xmath310@xmath4 s , which is most probably determined by the light travel time across the source emitting region ( see discussion in @xmath22 4 ) , we obtain @xmath57 = @xmath58@xmath39@xmath59 = 3.0@xmath310@xmath60 cm for a moderate beaming factor of @xmath59 = 20 ( e.g. , kataoka et al . 1999 ; 2000 for self - consistent determination of physical parameters in tev blazars ) . with this parameter",

    "the dashed line is a prediction by a one - zone ssc model ( kataoka et al .",
    "[ fig : sed ] ]",
    "in our observation we detected a large flare during which the hard x - ray variation lagged behind that in the soft x - rays , @xmath71 s. this is completely opposite to a well - known behavior in which the spectra harden during the phases of rising flux , and soften during the phases of falling flux , as has been obtained from the past observations . in the theoretical context , however , `` hard lag''is actually expected especially in the x - ray variability of tev blazars , but has never been observed so clearly before .",
    "it has been suggested that a hard - lag is observable only at energies closer to the maximum electron energy , @xmath72 ( kirk , rieger & mastichiadis 1998 ) , where the acceleration time is almost comparable to the cooling time scale of radiating electrons : @xmath73 @xmath35 @xmath74 .",
    "it is convenient to express @xmath75 and @xmath76 in terms of the observed photon energy @xmath77 ( in units of kev ) . noting that the typical synchrotron emission frequency , averaged over pitch angles , of an electron with energy @xmath12@xmath78 is given by @xmath79 @xmath2 3.7@xmath310@xmath80@xmath9@xmath81 hz",
    ", we obtain ; @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the redshift , @xmath9 is the magnetic field strength , @xmath10 is the `` gyro - factor '' which can be identified with the ratio of energy in an ordered magnetic field to that in a turbulent magnetic field ( @xmath10 = 1 for the bohm limit ; see , e.g. , inoue & takahara 1996 ) , and @xmath59 is the beaming factor .",
    "note that for lower energy photons , @xmath84 is always shorter than @xmath85 because higher energy electrons need longer time to be accelerated ( @xmath86 @xmath87 @xmath12 ) but cool rapidly ( @xmath88 @xmath87 @xmath89 ) .",
    "this energy dependence of acceleration / cooling time - scales may qualitatively explain the observed characteristics of the x - ray light curves of 1es  1218 + 304 .",
    "it is thus interesting to consider a simple toy model in which the rise time of the flare is primarily controlled by the acceleration time of the electrons corresponding to observed photon energies , while the fall time of the flare is due to the synchrotron cooling time scale . in this model ,",
    "the amount of `` hard - lag '' , @xmath90 , is simply due to the difference of @xmath75 , and independent of the energy dependence of @xmath76 : @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are the lower and higher x - ray photon energies to which the time - lag is observed .",
    "here we took @xmath94 to be the logarithmic mean energy in the observation energy bandpass .",
    "the result of the model fit to the observed @xmath90 is shown in figure [ fig : lag ] ( @xmath95 ) .    assuming a beaming factor @xmath96 from multiband spectral fitting ( see @xmath22 3 ) , the best fit parameter of the magnetic field @xmath9 can be written as @xmath97 g , where @xmath98 is the `` gyro - factor '' in units of @xmath11 .",
    "thus , in order to have the @xmath9 field required in the acceleration region consistent with that derived from the sed fitting , we infer @xmath99 . such high value of @xmath10 is in fact consistent with that inferred by inoue & takahara ( 1996 ) for other blazars . with these parameters , the maximum synchrotron radiation energy @xmath13 , corresponding to @xmath72 ,",
    "is expected to be @xmath100 kev .",
    "hence , the above toy model qualitatively well represents the observed spectral / temporal features of 1es  1218 + 304 , in particular : ( 1 ) the synchrotron component peaks around the @xmath0 xis energy band in the multiband spectrum ( figure [ fig : sed ] ) and ( 2 ) the observed light curve is symmetric in shape when measured at the high energy band , while being `` asymmetric '' ( i.e. , fall time longer than the rise time ) at the lower energy band . figure [ fig : lag ] ( @xmath101 ) compares the energy dependence of observed and modeled flare shapes , defined as the ratio of rise and decay time - scales , @xmath31/@xmath32 .",
    "the dashed line shows the model prediction from @xmath31/@xmath32 @xmath35 @xmath102 = @xmath103 kev .",
    "although the general trend is well reproduced , figure [ fig : lag ] indicates that the observed rise time may have a bit longer time scale than expected from the model .",
    "the most natural interpretation for this is the smoothing of rapid variability by the source light crossing time scale @xmath104 ( e.g. , chiaberge & ghisellini 1999 ; kataoka et al . 2000 ) .",
    "hence if the acceleration time scale is shorter than the source crossing time , we expect @xmath104 to smooth out @xmath75 . the dash - dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : lag ] ( @xmath101 ) shows the ratio of the time scales of @xmath104/@xmath76 .",
    "we can see that @xmath104 is longer than @xmath75 below @xmath105 kev , but comparable or shorter above @xmath105 kev . as a result , for 1es  1218 + 304",
    "it seems reasonable that the rise time of the flare is primary determined by the acceleration time of the electrons , while the fall time of the flare is due to the synchrotron cooling time scale .",
    "only the rise time of the flare in the lower energy bands are dominated by the light crossing time @xmath104 , but further studies using more data are necessary to confirm this model .",
