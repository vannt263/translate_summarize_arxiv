    "it has been known that , for a given soliton equation , there exists a discrete analogue of the evolution equation , which preserves integrability .",
    "once we find a discrete integrable equation , we can derive infinitely many integrable differential equations by taking continuous limits of variables in many different ways .",
    "we are interested in characterizing such integrable discrete systems .    in our previous papers",
    "@xcite we studied various integrable discrete systems which have certain symmetry and satisfy periodic boundary conditions . in this approach",
    "the nature of a quadratic equation , imposed by the boundary condition , plays a crucial role .",
    "the map which generates a time evolution turns out to be twofold , corresponding to two solutions of the quadratic equation .",
    "we showed that the discriminant of the quadratic equation becomes a perfect square when the system is integrable . owing to this fact the map is free from a square root ,",
    "hence is rational .",
    "we will call this type of map a non square root map ( nsrm ) in what follows .",
    "the discrete versions of lotka - volterra equation , kdv equation , toda lattice , kp equation and painlev equations @xcite are such examples .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to generalize this scheme of characterizing discrete integrable systems .    to clarify the point of our argument",
    "let us show first a typical example .",
    "the 3-point discrete time toda lattice is given by the set of coupled equations : @xmath1 here @xmath2 means the variable @xmath3 at the time @xmath4 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath5 .",
    "we impose the periodic conditions @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "hence there are 6 dependent variables .    before solving eq.([eqn : dtoda ] ) directly it is more instructive to solve @xmath8 for arbitrary functions @xmath9 of @xmath10 .",
    "we can also write them as @xmath11 note that they are special cases of mbius transformation .",
    "hence by repeating this transformation , say for the first equation of eq.([eqn : dtoda3 ] ) , three times , @xmath2 is given in terms of @xmath12 , which are nothing but @xmath13 themselves owing to the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "in this way we obtain an equation @xmath14 or , equivalently , @xmath15 where @xmath16 in the case of three point toda lattice .",
    "the quadratic equation eq.([quadratic eq ] ) has two solutions @xmath17 unless its discriminant @xmath18 vanishes .",
    "the general form of solutions contain square root of polynomial functions . under this circumstance",
    "a sequence of the map will yield very complicated orbits in general .",
    "but the integrable systems are not such cases , _",
    "i.e. _ , the discriminant happens to be a perfect square of some polynomial .",
    "in fact if we substitute the right hand sides of eq.([eqn : dtoda ] ) into @xmath19 s and @xmath20 s of the expression eq.([abcd ] ) , the discriminant is considerably simplified and is given by @xmath21 this is a typical non square root map ( nsrm ) , which we are going to study ( see below for more precise definition ) .",
    "this remarkable feature could be understood from other point of view as well .",
    "namely by an inspection of our original equations eq.([eqn : dtoda ] ) we can see easily that @xmath22 is one of sets of solution .",
    "this implies that another set of solutions of the quadratic equation eq.([quadratic eq ] ) must not have a square root either .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the existence of the solution of such simple form eq.([x = u ] ) owes to the symmetry of the equation eq.([eqn : dtoda ] ) .",
    "we will study , in the following section , @xmath23-point maps under which the square roots are removed when periodic boundary conditions are imposed . in section 3 the discrete time toda equation is studied in detail based on the preceding argument . in particular we will show that this scheme enables one to generalize the toda equation to a @xmath0-difference form , so that various @xmath0-difference soliton equations are derived by reductions , including the @xmath24 equation by kajiwara , noumi and yamada@xcite . in section 4 , we will discuss time evolution of solutions .",
    "the last section is devoted to summarize arguments in this paper .",
    "we consider @xmath23-point systems in this section and study conditions under which a map becomes a non square root map ( nsrm ) .",
    "generalizing eq.([eqn : dtoda3 ] ) , let us consider the following sequence of mbius transformations , @xmath25 and mbius matrices @xmath26 after @xmath23 times of the transformation we obtain the equation @xmath27 while the corresponding mbius map is given by @xmath28    we now impose the periodic boundary conditions @xmath29 .",
    "then the formula eq.([n step map ] ) is equal to the quadratic equation @xmath30 the solutions of this equation are given by @xmath31 whereas the discriminant @xmath32 is @xmath33      in this subsection we study maps such that the discriminant eq.([dis ] ) becomes a perfect square of some polynomial function . as we will prove shortly the following 6 patterns of the map @xmath34 satisfy the requirement : @xmath35 @xmath36    proof :    since the trace and the determinant are invariant under the transposition ot the matrices , we do not consider here the fourth and sixth patterns .",
    "for the first three patterns we find @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 is a certain function of @xmath40 . from this expression",
    "we easily find @xmath41 corresponding to the first , second and the third patterns .    for the 5th pattern we first observe @xmath42 in order to calculate @xmath43 , we split @xmath34 into two parts @xmath44 using the property @xmath45 we can see that @xmath46 has terms of the form",
    "@xmath47 only . from this fact , the trace of @xmath46 is calculated as @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "similarly we can treat the 6th pattern and obtain the same results as eqs.([det of 5th ] ) and ( [ trace of 5th ] ) for the determinant and trace , respectively .",
    "hence we have obtained discriminants for all six patterns as follows :    [ cols=\"<,<,<,^ , < \" , ]     therefore every discrete equation with the mbius matrix pattern of eq.([nonsrs - pat ] ) has no square root , although they are not all .",
    "solutions of the quadratic equation eq.([quadra eq ] ) are given by eq.([sol : quad ] ) .",
    "the purpose of this subsection is to write them explicitly in the case of nsrm .",
    "first we note that the 2nd and the 3rd pattern as well as even @xmath23 case of the 1st pattern do not form a quadratic equation due to @xmath50 .",
    "hence it is enough to consider the odd @xmath23 case of 1st pattern , 4th , 5th and 6th patterns .",
    "the odd @xmath23 case is given by the following setup : @xmath51 hence the solutions of the quadratic equation are @xmath52      in this pattern we have @xmath53 to calculate @xmath39 , we split @xmath34 to two parts @xmath54 and @xmath55 as follows : @xmath56 using the fact @xmath57 , we see that @xmath46 has terms of the form @xmath58 only , where @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "all possible terms can be written in such forms as @xmath61 hence we find the expression of @xmath39 as @xmath62 the solutions of the quadratic equation are then given as follows : @xmath63      we already got @xmath43 and @xmath64 in the previous subsection , but did not have calculated the elements of @xmath46 . to obtain the solution of the quadratic equation , we must find their elements since information about @xmath65 and @xmath66 are necessary for the solutions .",
    "the splitting idea of eq.([split:5th ] ) is convenient to obtain the elements here again .",
    "using this idea , we need to calculate only the following quantities @xmath67 because @xmath68 .",
    "hence @xmath69 and @xmath70 of the elements of @xmath46 are obtained as @xmath71 consequently , noting the fact @xmath72 , we obtain the solutions of the quadratic equation as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the homogeneous polynomial of @xmath75 , that is @xmath76      for this pattern too , we already got @xmath43 and @xmath64 in the previous subsection , but did not have calculated the elements of @xmath46 .",
    "using the splitting idea again , the elements of @xmath46 in this pattern are able to be obtained .",
    "the splitting of @xmath34 in this case is @xmath77 since @xmath78 , we are enough to calculate the following terms @xmath79 hence we obtain @xmath69 and @xmath70 of the elements of @xmath46 as @xmath80 if we further use @xmath81 , we get solutions of the quadratic equation as follows : @xmath82      we note that polynomial @xmath83 s , which appear in the solutions of the 5th and 6th patterns , are given by the minor determinants of the diagonal entries of the following matrix .",
    "@xmath84 for simplicity , we will introduce the following notations .",
    "@xmath85 namely , the matrix @xmath83 having entries in ascending order is expressed by @xmath83 , and in descending order by @xmath86 .",
    "these matrices are related by @xmath87 where @xmath88    we set symbols of them of @xmath89-entry as @xmath90 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath91 where @xmath92 .",
    "these polynomials satisfy the following useful relations .    1 .   @xmath93,[q = q^v ] 2 .",
    "@xmath94[(b+c)q = bq+cq ] .",
    "the relation @xmath95 is obvious .",
    "the relation @xmath96 is non - trivial and will be checked by means of more fundamental relation : @xmath97 where @xmath98 .",
    "we can show that @xmath99 coincides with the cofactor of the @xmath89 element of the product @xmath100 of the following matrices @xmath101 which could represent the dtoda equations @xcite .",
    "the discriminant @xmath32 is invariant under arbitrary similarity transformations , since it is given by the trace and determinant of @xmath46 .",
    "this fact enables us to modify our map starting from the six patterns we considered above .",
    "namely under the transformation of @xmath34 , @xmath102 the matrix eq.([s = mm ... m ] ) is changed into @xmath103 if we take into account the periodic boundary condition , we must have @xmath104 .",
    "therefore the trace and the determinant of @xmath46 , hence the discriminant @xmath32 as well , remain constant : @xmath105 under the transformation eq.([transf : mod ] ) for arbitrary matrices @xmath106 s .",
    "this implies that the modified map @xmath107 is nsrm if @xmath34 is so .    now denoting by @xmath108 the modified variable of @xmath109 , we will write the mbius map associated with @xmath34 as @xmath110 . in this way",
    ", the modified mbius map is possible to be written as @xmath111 here if we define @xmath112 , then @xmath113 as a result , the following two modifications are equivalent @xmath114 this correspondence is preserved in the solutions of the quadratic equation , so we can create many equations from the basic six patterns in this way .",
    "we study , in this section , the @xmath23-point discrete time toda equation ( dtoda ) in detail from the view point of the previous section .",
    "let us start with writing the @xmath23-point dtoda equation . @xmath115 in order to apply the argument in the previous section to this system we transform eq.([eqn : n - point dtoda ] ) into the form of mbius transformation , @xmath116 corresponding to @xmath117 .",
    "we notice that this is a modified 5th pattern mbius transformation which is specified by the following data : @xmath118 substituting these data into eq.([sol:5th ] ) we obtain solutions immediately . before writing them down , however , it is convenient to simplify notations .",
    "namely the matrix @xmath83 , which appears in the solutions , is @xmath119 .",
    "let the matrix @xmath83 be @xmath120 and its minor determinants be @xmath121 these minor determinants satisfy    1 .",
    "@xmath122 , 2 .",
    "@xmath123 3 .",
    "@xmath124    where @xmath125 .",
    "therefore the solutions turn out to be @xmath126    similarly the time reversal map is obtained by writing eq.([eqn : n - point dtoda ] ) as @xmath127 corresponding to the map @xmath128 .",
    "this is again a modified 5th pattern of the mbius transformation .",
    "the modification matrix and the elements of the map are given by @xmath129 and the solutions @xmath130    instead of eq.([mm : toda 1 ] ) and eq.([mm : toda 1 inverse ] ) we could write the dtoda equation eq.([eqn : n - point dtoda ] ) in the form @xmath131 corresponding to @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "these are modified 6th patterns whose elements and the modification matrix are given by @xmath134 for eq.([mm : toda 2 ] ) and eq.([mm : toda 2 inverse ] ) , respectively .",
    "applying these data to eq.([sol:6th ] ) we obtain the same results of eq.([b - type : toda ] ) and eq.([b - type : toda inv ] ) .",
    "we have seen that the b - type solution is simply 1 if the map @xmath34 is the form of either 5th or 6th pattern .",
    "a modification of the matrix by @xmath106 will change the solutions as well as the equation while the discriminant remains constant .",
    "in particular a different b - type solution will correspond to a different set of equations , and hence different a - type solution .",
    "if the b - type solution is rational the a - type solution must be also rational satisfying the same equations .    to see how it works we try to generalize the b - type solution eq.([b - type : toda ] ) to @xmath135 it is not difficult to find their corresponding equations @xmath136 from the construction this equation has also a - type solution which is a rational polynomial of @xmath137 and @xmath138 . and we can set @xmath139 without loss of generality .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the b - type solution follows automatically to the symmetry possessed by the equation .",
    "in other words , the rational solution of a - type is a consequence of the symmetry of the toda lattice equation .      in the paper @xcite kajiwara",
    "_ et al . _ have studied affine - weyl symmetry of the discrete time painlev iv equation with parameters , which is called @xmath0p@xmath140 .",
    "we have shown in our previous paper @xcite that @xmath0p@xmath140 is one of the equations which are characterized by the square root free maps .",
    "now we want to know whether exist similar generalization of the discrete time toda lattice eq.([eqn : n - point dtoda ] ) which we have been studying . to this end",
    "we consider the following equation with a set of parameters @xmath141 : @xmath142 let us call this equation a @xmath0-difference generalized discrete time toda equation ( @xmath0toda ) . remarkably this equation has the symmetry of modified 5th or 6th pattern of the mbius map",
    "so , this is transformed to a quadratic equation of every @xmath143 or @xmath138 , and has two types of map as solutions to eq.([qtoda ] ) .",
    "in fact if we introduce @xmath144 we obtain two maps as follows : @xmath145 where @xmath146 , and @xmath147 is defined by @xmath148      we can further generalize @xmath0toda to higher dimensions by increasing the number of suffices : @xmath149 the b - type map should have the form @xmath150    in the case of @xmath151 , for instance , @xmath152 satisfies @xmath153 this is the @xmath0kp equation which we derived in our previous paper .",
    "it has been well known that the discrete time lotka - volterra equation ( dlv ) can be obtained from the discrete time toda equation by a miura transformation @xcite .",
    "we like to show , in this section , that the same dlv - type as well as the discrete time kdv ( dkdv)-type equations can be derived from the discrete time toda lattice eq.([qtoda ] ) by simple reductions .",
    "the basic idea of our reduction is to deal with one of two equations in @xmath0toda as a constraint to eliminate half of the variables .",
    "the way of reduction to a dlv - type equation is to impose an additional constraint to the second equation of @xmath0toda as follows .",
    "@xmath154 where @xmath155 s are constants .",
    "this constraint enables us to eliminate variables , say @xmath138 and @xmath156 , from the first equation .",
    "namely the following substitution @xmath157 yields the dlv - type equation @xmath158    when @xmath159 , this is the dlv equation . various types of @xmath0lv equations which were discussed in our previous paper , are included in this equation .",
    "it is straightforward to obtain two maps of this equation .",
    "we find @xmath160 which could be also obtained from the map of qtoda eq.([qtoda ] ) by the substitution eq.([substitution ] ) .",
    "the @xmath0p@xmath161 of kajiwara , noumi , yamada @xcite is included as one of the a - type map .",
    "let us try an alternative case of constraint .",
    "namely we impose a constraint to the first equation of eq.([qtoda ] ) .",
    "@xmath162 this enables us to eliminate @xmath138 and @xmath156 from the second equation according to the rule @xmath163 from which we obtain @xmath164 this equation containes the discrete time kdv equation as a special case .",
    "hence we call eq.([qdkdv ] ) the @xmath0kdv equation .",
    "the corresponding solutions are given again by simply replacing @xmath138 and @xmath156 in the solutions of @xmath0toda according to eq.([qkdv reduction rule ] ) .",
    "@xmath165      we define some symbols of the two types of map and their inverse maps of dtoda as follows , @xmath166 these maps satisfy the following relations .",
    "@xmath167 or @xmath168 where @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "the relations eq.([cd ] ) are derived from eq.([ab ] ) by some calculations , automatically .",
    "the reflection maps @xmath171 change the inverse a - type map to the inverse b - type one and the a - type one to the b - type one , respectively .",
    "namely , @xmath172 hence , these reflection maps are permutations of solutions of the quadratic equation eq.([quadra eq ] ) in the case of dtoda , _",
    "i.e. _ galois tranformations of eq.([quadra eq ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the generalized version of dtoda eq.([gdtoda ] ) satisfy these relations eq.([ab ] ) or eq.([cd ] ) , but @xmath0toda does not .",
    "these reflection maps play an important role in affine - wyel symmetries and @xmath0-difference painlev equations as studied by kajiwara , _",
    "et al_. @xcite .",
    "a sequence of b - type map does not generate an orbit but causes exchange of the variables @xmath137 and @xmath138 , whereas an a - type map generates an orbit .",
    "we will study a discrete time evolution of a - type map in this section . to make the time dependence explicit we write the variables @xmath173 and @xmath156 as @xmath174 and @xmath175 in the following .      a repeated use of eq.([b - type : toda ] )",
    "enables one to express @xmath176 and @xmath177 in terms of @xmath178 s and @xmath179 s as @xmath180 here we denote by @xmath181 the following polynomial of @xmath182 s and @xmath183 s , @xmath184    if we substitute eq.([x^t+1 , u^t+1 ] ) into the right hand side of eq.([q_k^t ] ) we will find a considerable cancellation of factors in the numerator and the denominator .",
    "the cancellation might be associated with a reduction of algebraic entropy @xcite . as a consequence",
    "we obtain a recurrence equation for @xmath185 : @xmath186    the a - type solutions are given if @xmath185 is found by solving eq.([iteration ] ) iteratively .",
    "the generalization of this result to the case of @xmath0toda is straightforward .",
    "this is , however , a cumbersome task .",
    "and so , we will look orbits of a - type map described by numerical computation .      it is not difficult to see behaviour of orbits of the a - type map eq.([x^t+1 , u^t+1 ] ) as long as we generate them numerically by using computers .",
    "they are constrained on curves since there are sufficient number of conserved quantities .",
    "if parameters @xmath187 s and @xmath188 s are introduced the orbits tend to expand and closed curves turn to spirals .",
    "these are behaviours which we could expect naively from our previous experiences .",
    "instead of studying them in detail we would like to present here behaviour of ultra - discrete version of solutions .",
    "it has been known that if a discrete integrable equation has its ultra - discrete version the integrability is preserved @xcite .",
    "there exists a systematic method to ultra - discretize a discrete integrable equation if it contains only product and summation of variables but not subtractions .",
    "namely we introduce a new variable @xmath189 and replace @xmath137 by @xmath190 .",
    "the ultra - discretization procedure @xcite is defined by @xmath191    to be specific let us consider the case of dkdv - type equation .",
    "the @xmath0-difference version has been given by eq.([qdkdv ] ) .",
    "if we further specify to 3-point case the equations are @xmath192 @xmath193 the corresponding a - type map can be also found readily from the one of @xmath0-toda equation by the reduction eq.([qkdv reduction rule ] ) .",
    "@xmath194 @xmath193 the ultra - discrete version of eq.([3-qkdv - a ] ) turns to @xmath195    [ fig : udkdv00 ]    [ fig : udkdv01 ]    [ fig : udkdv02 ]    [ fig : udkdv03 ]    here we set @xmath196 .",
    "let @xmath197 s and @xmath198 s be rational numbers and impose a condition @xmath199 so that the map returns to initial values after some steps . under these circumstances",
    "we find maps such as presented in figures [ fig : udkdv00 ] to [ fig : udkdv03 ] .",
    "figure 1 shows the case of @xmath200 for all j=0,1,2 .",
    "similarly fig .",
    "2 corresponds to the case of @xmath199 and @xmath201 .",
    "the straight lines in these figures are known to correspond to integrable orbits @xcite .",
    "figures 3 and 4 are the cases of @xmath202 and @xmath203 respectively",
    ". they do not seem to describe integrable orbits .",
    "therefore the orbits behave differently for different value of @xmath204 .",
    "this must be contrasted with the case of dkdv in which orbits form smooth closed curves under the condition @xmath205 for all @xmath206 .",
    "it will be worth while to point out that the dkdv map eq.([3-qkdv - a ] ) in the case of @xmath201 is invariant under the following bcklund transformation @xmath207 where @xmath208 @xmath209 and @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "this is the same affine weyl symmetry shared by @xmath0p@xmath140 @xcite . but",
    "@xmath23(@xmath2124)-point dkdv maps of @xmath201 does not have this symmetry even though it exhibits an integrable orbit .",
    "we have also studied 3-point ultra - discrete lv - type maps in the same manner .",
    "the results are similar to those of kdv - type maps and found one integrable map corresponding to the @xmath0p@xmath140 .",
    "the main purpose of this paper was to clarify the method characterizing discrete integrable systems , which we introduced in our porevious works . we have shown that ,",
    "in the case of integrable systems , two adjacent variables are related by a mbius transformation of special forms .",
    "we found at least 6 patterns of such forms .",
    "this observation enabled us to obtain quite large class of new discrete integrable systems . the generalized discrete toda equations ( dtoda ) of eq.([gdtoda ] )",
    "is one of such examples . by certain reductions of the dtoda equation dkdv and dlv were obtained .",
    "the method admits introduction of arbitrary parameters into the equations and further generalization to @xmath0toda systems .",
    "if we solve the equations in the form in which each variable is given as a function of variables in the previous time , there exist always two types of solutions which we called a - type and b - type",
    ". the b - type map does not create orbit but exchanges variables , while a sequence of the a - type map generates an orbit .",
    "the map of a - type is written as a rational polynomial of variables whose numerator and denominator are expressed by minor determinants of the matrix @xmath83 in eq.([q ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to notice that this matrix @xmath83 is the same one known in the field of affine weyl group and @xmath0-painlev equations @xcite .",
    "we have not succeeded analyzing full behaviour of a sequence of a - type maps .",
    "it is one of the most interesting problems to find behaviour of the map when parameters @xmath187 s and @xmath188 s are introduced .",
    "some numerical results using ultra - discrete method have shown that the introduction of the parameters preserve integrability in some cases but not always .",
