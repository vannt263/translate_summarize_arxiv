    "in the early 90 s , two new ` quantum ' invariants of @xmath5-manifolds were introduced : the _ reshetikhin - turaev invariant _ , and the _ turaev - viro invariant_. the definition of the reshetikhin - turaev invariant @xmath6  @xcite involves a _ modular category _",
    "@xmath7 , that is , a ribbon fusion category over a commutative ring @xmath3 satisfying a non - degeneracy condition ( invertibility of the @xmath8-matrix ) .",
    "the algorithm for computing its value on a @xmath5-manifold consists in presenting the manifold by surgery along a ribbon link and then taking a linear combination of colorings of this link by simple objects of @xmath7 .",
    "similarly , the definition of the turaev - viro invariant @xmath9 @xcite , as revisited by barrett and westbury @xcite , involves a _",
    "spherical category _ , that is , a sovereign fusion category over a commutative ring @xmath3 such that left and right traces coincide .",
    "the dimension @xmath10 of @xmath2 ( which is the sum of squares of dimensions of simple objects ) is moreover assumed to be invertible in  @xmath3 .",
    "the algorithm for computing @xmath11 consists in presenting the @xmath5-manifold @xmath12 by a triangulation , coloring the edges of the triangulation with simple objects of @xmath2 , and then evaluating the colored tetrahedra by means of the @xmath13-symbols of @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath7 is a modular category , then it is also a spherical category , and the reshetikhin - turaev and turaev - viro invariants are related @xcite by : @xmath14 for any @xmath5manifold @xmath12 , where @xmath15 is the @xmath5-manifold @xmath12 with opposite orientation .",
    "but in general a spherical category need not to be braided and so can not be used as input to define the reshetikhin - turaev invariant .",
    "however , spherical and modular categories are related by a theorem of mger @xcite : if  @xmath2 is a spherical fusion category over an algebraically closed field @xmath3 and has invertible dimension , then its center @xmath0 is a modular fusion category of dimension @xmath16 . in this",
    "setting , turaev conjectured that , for any @xmath5-manifold @xmath12 , @xmath17 this conjecture was shown to be true for some spherical categories  @xmath2 arising from subfactors , see @xcite .",
    "the general case is still open .    in this context ,",
    "a natural question is : how can we compute @xmath18 ? using the algorithm given by reshetikhin and turaev is not a practicable approach here , as that would require a description of the simple objects of @xmath0 in terms of those of @xmath2 , and no such description is available in general .",
    "what we need is a different algorithm for computing @xmath18 , which one should be able to perform inside  @xmath2 , without reference to the simple objects of @xmath0 .",
    "this is the primary objective of this paper .    in order to fulfill this objective",
    ", it will be convenient to adopt an alternative approach for constructing @xmath19-like quantum invariants of @xmath5-manifolds , due to lyubashenko @xcite and later developed in @xcite , where the input data is a ( non - necessarily linear neither semisimple ) ribbon category @xmath7 which admits a coend @xmath20 .",
    "this coend @xmath21 is naturally endowed with a very rich algebraic structure .",
    "in particular , it is a hopf algebra in the braided category @xmath7 and comes equipped with a hopf pairing @xmath22 .",
    "such a category @xmath7 is modular if the pairing @xmath23 is non - degenerate ( this is the natural way of formulating the invertibility of the @xmath8-matrix in this setting ) .",
    "the construction of the lyubashenko invariant consists in presenting the @xmath5-manifold by surgery along a ribbon link @xmath24 , using the universal property of the coend @xmath21 to associate a form @xmath25 to the link , and then evaluating this form on an integral  @xmath26 of the hopf algebra  @xmath21 .",
    "note that , more generally , one can evaluate the form @xmath25 by a ` kirby element ' @xmath27 of @xmath7 to get other invariants @xmath28 of @xmath5-manifold invariants , see @xcite .",
    "in particular , up to normalization , @xmath29 is the lyubashenko invariant and , in the special case where @xmath7 is a modular fusion category , @xmath29 is the reshetikhin - turaev invariant .    in order to make this construction effective , we need an algorithm for computing the forms @xmath25 which are defined by universal property . such an algorithm , based on an encoding of certain tangles by means of _ hopf diagrams _ , is given in @xcite .",
    "thus the invariants @xmath28 can be expressed in terms of certain structural morphisms of the coend @xmath21 .",
    "section  [ sect - invquant ] is devoted to these quantum invariants and their computation .",
    "hence , when @xmath2 is a spherical fusion category , we may compute @xmath30 provided we can describe explicitly the structural morphisms of the coend of @xmath0 .",
    "in other words , we need an algebraic interpretation of the center construction . if  @xmath2 is braided and has a coend @xmath31 ( which is a hopf algebra ) , then the category @xmath0 coincides with the category of ( right ) @xmath31-modules in @xmath2 .",
    "however the difficulty here is that we do nt want to assume @xmath2 is braided . to bypass this difficulty ,",
    "we use the notion of _ hopf monad _ introduced in @xcite .",
    "hopf monads generalize hopf algebras in a non - braided setting .",
    "in particular , finite - dimensional hopf algebras and their different generalizations ( hopf algebras in braided autonomous categories , quantum bialgebroids , etc ... ) provide examples of hopf monads .",
    "if fact , any monoidal adjunction between autonomous categories gives rise to a hopf monad .",
    "it turns out that much of the theory of finite - dimensional hopf algebras extends to hopf monads , see @xcite . in section  [ sect - monad ] , we recall a few results on hopf monads .",
    "the whole point of introducing hopf monads here is that they provide an algebraic interpretation of the center construction @xcite . if @xmath2 is a _",
    "centralizable _ autonomous category , meaning that the coend @xmath32 exists for any object  @xmath33 of @xmath2 , then @xmath4 is a quasitriangular hopf monad on @xmath2 and the center  @xmath0 coincides , as a braided category , with the category of @xmath4-modules in @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , drinfeld s double construction extends naturally to hopf monads .",
    "this theory provides a description of the coend of @xmath0 . in section [ sect - thedouble ]",
    ", we recall a few facts on the double of hopf monads .    in section [ sect - rt ] ,",
    "we apply the above results to spherical fusion categories .",
    "firstly , we obtain a generalization of mger s theorem on the modularity of the center of a spherical fusion category @xmath2 to the case where @xmath10 is not necessarily invertible and  @xmath3 is any commutative ring . denoting by @xmath34 a ( finite ) representative family of scalar objects of @xmath2",
    ", we get : @xmath35 moreover @xmath0 is centralizable and @xmath16 .",
    "the underlying object of the coend of @xmath0 is : @xmath36 and all structural morphisms of @xmath21 ( including its integral @xmath37 ) can be written down explicitly in @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath0 is always modular .",
    "when @xmath3 is an algebraically closed field and @xmath10 is invertible , then @xmath0 is a fusion category and so we recover mger s theorem .",
    "however , when @xmath10 is not invertible , @xmath0 is a non - semisimple ribbon category . nevertheless ,",

    "<S> a theorem of mger asserts that the center @xmath0 of a spherical @xmath1-linear category @xmath2 is a modular category if @xmath3 is an algebraically closed field and the dimension of @xmath2 is invertible . </S>",
    "<S> we generalize this result to the case where @xmath3 is an arbitrary commutative ring , without restriction on the dimension of the category . </S>",
    "<S> moreover we construct the analogue of the reshetikhin - turaev invariant associated to @xmath0 and give an algorithm for computing this invariant in terms of certain explicit morphisms in the category @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is based on ( a )  lyubashenko s construction of the reshetikhin - turaev invariant in terms of the coend of a ribbon category ; ( b )  an explicit algorithm for computing this invariant via hopf diagrams ;  ( c ) an algebraic interpretation of the center of @xmath2 as the category of modules over a certain hopf monad @xmath4 on the category @xmath2 ; ( d )  a generalization of the classical notion of drinfeld double to hopf monads , which , applied to the hopf monad @xmath4 , provides an explicit description of the coend of @xmath0 in terms of the category @xmath2 . </S>"
