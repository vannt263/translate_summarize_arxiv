    "lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) is predicted to occur at an unobservably small rate in the standard model ( sm ) . in low energy supersymmetric theories , new sources of lepton flavor violation",
    "are generic in the soft breaking sector .",
    "the experimental non - observation of @xmath9 processes is particularly restrictive , given the impressive bounds on @xmath10 from mega @xcite and meg @xcite ; on @xmath9 conversion from sindrum  ii @xcite , and to a lesser extent from @xmath11 from sindrum @xcite .",
    "further progress is expected from the varied experiments that are ongoing as well as planned future experiments such as mu2e @xcite and other proposals utilizing project x at fermilab @xcite .    in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) ,",
    "@xmath0 mixing is severely constrained by these bounds ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the size of the mixing can be characterized by the quantity @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the off - diagonal @xmath14-entry appearing in the sfermion mass matrix connecting the @xmath15-handed slepton to the @xmath16-handed slepton , and @xmath17 is the average slepton mass .",
    "@xcite found @xmath18 , while @xmath19 over a scan of the msugra parameter space .",
    "similarly strong bounds on @xmath20 can also be found , though cancellations between diagrams in the amplitude can in some cases allow for much larger mixing @xcite .",
    "recently , a new approach to weak scale supersymmetry that incorporates an extended @xmath1-symmetry @xcite , suggests large flavor violation in the supersymmetry breaking parameters may be present _ without _ exceeding the flavor - violating bounds .",
    "this is possible for several reasons : @xmath1-symmetric supersymmetry has no flavor - violating lr mixing , solving the worst of the problem trivially .",
    "@xmath1-symmetric supersymmetry has dirac gauginos , and no majorana masses , removing all dimension-5 flavor - violating operators .",
    "finally @xmath1-symmetric supersymmetry also has no flavor - conserving lr mixing , and so there are no `` large @xmath21 enhanced '' effects .",
    "these benefits were found to virtually eliminate constraints on the slepton flavor mixing @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we reconsider the constraints on slepton mixing , specifically , @xmath0 mixing .",
    "unlike the mssm , the most important constraint is not necessarily @xmath6 .",
    "this is easily seen by inspection of the @xmath1-symmetric flavor - violating operators : @xmath6 requires a chirality - flip via a muon yukawa coupling , whereas @xmath4 conversion has no such requirement .",
    "we find that @xmath4 conversion rules out maximal mixing throughout the right - handed slepton mixing parameter space for sub - tev superpartner masses .",
    "this is complementary to @xmath6 , where we find cancellations between the bino and higgsino diagrams , analogous to what was found before in the mssm @xcite . for left - handed slepton",
    "mixing , we find possible cancellations in the amplitudes for @xmath4 conversion , and instead @xmath6 provides generally the strongest constraint . we also calculated @xmath3 and find it provides the weakest constraint on both left - handed and right - handed slepton mixing throughout the parameter space we consider .",

    "[ lhc - sec ] we briefly discuss implications for slepton flavor violation to be observed at lhc . finally , in sec .",
    "[ discussion - sec ] we conclude with a discussion of our results .",
    "we are interested in analyzing lfv in the minimal @xmath1-symmetric standard model ( mrssm ) .",
    "the gaugino structure of the mrssm has been studied in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the mixings and couplings of the four dirac neutralinos and four dirac charginos are given .",
    "weak scale supersymmetry with dirac gauginos is a possibility that was contemplated some time ago @xcite and more recently @xcite .",
    "a fully general analysis of lfv in the mrssm would be a substantial undertaking .",
    "fortunately , there are several simplifications we can employ to gain a fairly general understanding of the allowed parameter space of lfv in the mrssm .",
    "one important restriction is that the dirac wino can not be light in the mrssm , due to the structure of the wino supersoft operator @xcite .",
    "essentially there is an unavoidable contribution to the vev of the @xmath22-triplet scalar that causes a contribution to the @xmath23 parameter that is too large unless the wino is above about a tev .",
    "secondly , since there is no coupling between up - type higgs and leptons , the contribution from the up - type higgsino eigenstates is suppressed by the small mixing between bino or @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and so can be ignored .",
    "itemizing the simplifications , we take :    * the wino mass , @xmath26 , is taken to be sufficiently large so as to give negligible contribution to flavor violating interactions .",
    "this simplification means that the @xmath23-parameter is automatically safe throughout the parameter space we consider . *",
    "the up - type higgsino mass @xmath27 , is also taken to be large for convenience .",
    "since the up - type higgsinos play no role whatsoever in charged lepton flavor - violation ( given also point 1 ) , this is done simply to keep the gaugino sector to a @xmath28 structure and thus easily understood .",
    "( we will , however , consider effects of a light up - type higgsino on flavor - violating signals at lhc in sec .",
    "[ lhc - sec ] . ) * we consider left - handed and right - handed slepton mixing separately .",
    "this is standard practice when considering flavor - violation in the mssm ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we will see that there are qualitative differences between the allowed parameter space of left - handed and right - handed slepton mixing .",
    "* we assume the slepton mixing is purely in the @xmath29 flavor space of @xmath30 .",
    "enlarging this mixing to the full @xmath31 mixing does not qualitatively change any of our results , and instead simply dilutes the effect of the mixing , while adding more mixing angles and thus more parameters to the model . since the focus of this paper is to explore @xmath0 mixing , no further discussion of the @xmath31 case will be given .",
    "* for our numerical results , we take @xmath32 . this seems a far more drastic assumption than it actually is .",
    "our motivation is to consider slepton flavor violation when there is essentially _ no degeneracy _ among the sleptons , and so we took the slepton mass ratio to be `` order one '' but not near one .",
    "taking the ratio much larger than one does not appreciably increase the flavor violation , while taking it smaller causes the super - gim mechanism to suppress the flavor - violating signal .",
    "our compromise is the above number .    in appendix  [ app - sec ] , we provide more details on the gaugino structure and flavor - violating interactions as directly relevant to this paper . with the above assumptions , there is only one light dirac chargino ( which is @xmath33-like ) and two light dirac neutralinos ( which are mixtures of @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) .",
    "a few more comments on the slepton mass eigenstate hierarchy are in order .",
    "mssm analyses of slepton flavor violation have , by necessity of lfv constraints , concentrated on the case where the mass difference between the different states is small , @xmath36 . in this limit , it is straightforward to show that the contribution to lfv can be expanded in powers of @xmath37 , taking the form @xmath38 where @xmath39 is typically the largest mass sparticle in the diagram that dominates the process .",
    "there is no @xmath40-independent contribution within the parentheses due to the super gim mechanism ( see the next section ) . since @xmath41 , one factor of @xmath37 cancels , giving proportionality to the @xmath42 parameter mentioned in the introduction and used in many other papers on lfv in the mssm ( at least up to a possible further suppression of @xmath43 if @xmath44 ) .",
    "in this paper , @xmath37 is not small , and so using the `` @xmath42 parameter '' is simply not appropriate .",
    "instead , it is easy to see that in the opposite limit , @xmath45 , the contributions to lfv are proportional to simply @xmath46 .",
    "hence , the relevant parameters we show in most of our numerical results are bounds on @xmath47 as a function of the slepton , gaugino , and higgsino masses . reducing the splitting can be roughly approximated by relaxing the constraint on @xmath47 by ratios of @xmath48 .",
    "the `` super - gim mechanism ''  the gim mechanism applied to flavor in the superpartner sector  is important in understanding the phenomena of flavor violation .",
    "as is well known , the super - gim mechanism arises as a consequence of the unitarity of the slepton mixing matrices that diagonalize the mass matrix ; @xmath49 , where the sum over repeated indices is performed .",
    "this combination of mixing matrix elements always appears as a prefactor in the calculation of amplitudes of flavor violating processes . specifically for our case of slepton flavor violation",
    ", we have @xmath50 , corresponding to an incoming muon , and an outgoing electron , with internal sleptons labeled by @xmath51 .",
    "the sum over @xmath51 corresponds to summing over all mass eigenstate sleptons @xmath52 in the loop .",
    "there are two immediate consequences of the super - gim mechanism .",
    "first , terms that do not depend on the slepton masses do not contribute .",
    "let @xmath53 be some function that depends on the mass of the sleptons and @xmath54 be some quantity that does not depend on @xmath55 , then @xmath56       = \\sum_k u^{\\dagger}_{ek}u_{k\\mu } f(m_k ) .",
    "\\label{gim}\\ ] ] the form of eq .",
    "( [ gim ] ) appears when a logarithmic divergent loop integral is dimensionally regularized , and one finds the @xmath57 term appearing as a constant term @xmath54 in the above equation .",
    "this leads to an important result : the would - be logarithmic uv divergence in flavor - conserving processes is , in fact , uv finite in flavor - violating processes . in this paper , unless otherwise stated , we will omit the terms in our expressions that are canceled by the super - gim mechanism .",
    "the other well known consequence is that , when all the sleptons are degenerate , there is no flavor violation .",
    "this can be seen again in eq .",
    "( [ gim ] ) with @xmath58 , the sum over all slepton flavors in a flavor - violating process vanishes .",
    "there are three @xmath59 conversion processes with experimental bounds : @xmath2 , @xmath4 conversion , and @xmath3 . in this section",
    "we present our calculations of the rates of these processes and present results in terms of a series of contour plots showing the allowed parameter space .",
    "the rate for @xmath2 was estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite in the slepton flavor - violating mass - insertion approximation with a pure bino and wino and a specific gaugino hierarchy . in this paper",
    "we have neglected the wino , due to the @xmath23 parameter constraint , and instead included the down - type higgsino @xmath34 .",
    "since we have considered large mixing angles , up to and including maximal mixing , we have diagonalized the slepton masses explicitly and done our loop calculations involving the slepton mass eigenstates .",
    "as stated in our simplifications , we have not included contributions from the wino or up - type higgsino .",
    "we focus on the case where the sleptons and the lighter neutralinos are in the sub - tev range where wino contributions can be reasonably ignored . the up - type higgsino does not couple to leptons , and we take the light quark yukawa couplings to vanish .",
    "thus , the up - type higgsino does not give a significant contribution to any of @xmath2 , @xmath4 conversion in nuclei and @xmath3 .    with these simplifications ,",
    "the amplitudes of lfv processes are sensitive to just two neutralinos , mixtures of @xmath35 and @xmath34 inside the loops .",
    "we can also neglect the contributions due to charginos because the only light chargino is @xmath34-like .",
    "hence , all types of diagrams we consider involving a chargino are suppressed not only by one power of muon yukawa , but also one power of either the electron yukawa , or the tiny wino content of the light chargino at the lepton - chargino - sneutrino vertex .",
    "this also means that sneutrino mixing does not contribute to lfv processes , and thus the difference in the amplitudes between left - handed and right - handed slepton mixing is due solely to the hypercharges and masses of the left - handed and right - handed charged leptons .",
    "the neutrinoless muon decay @xmath6 occurs through the effective magnetic dipole moment operator , @xmath60 , and requires a chirality flip of fermions .",
    "there are no tree level operators that lead to this decay , and the lowest order is at one loop . in the mrssm",
    ", there are only two types of contributions to the @xmath2 amplitude : one where the chirality flip occurs on the external muon line , and the other where the flip occurs as a result of a muon - smuon - higgsino vertex proportional to the muon yukawa coupling .",
