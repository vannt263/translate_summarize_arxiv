    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern in geneva , switzerland was designed to study the mass scale problem in physics , and has produced enough data over the last year to conclude an important discovery @xcite . also , the recent reports from satellite experiments @xcite have attracted a great deal of attention regarding possible particle spectrum in the tev ( or 1001000 gev ) mass region .",
    "probably , the satellite data will select in the near future some theoretical models in the tev energy region .",
    "search for all the particles in the standard model(sm ) has been completed with the higgs boson discovery @xcite .",
    "the higgs boson is responsible for giving masses to all the sm particles and the discovery has indeed confirmed the mechanism giving mass , with a remarkable precision , to gauge bosons @xcite and to fermions @xcite . in the sm , this is possible by introducing just one higgs doublet : @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "fundamental particles influence the evolution of the universe . among these , light particles , light in the planck mass unit @xmath4(@xmath5 ) , dominated the recent evolution dynamics of the universe .",
    "the new alpha magnetic spectrometer(ams ) data does not rule out the possibility that a cold dark matter component is weakly interacting massive particle with mass near tev @xcite .",
    "the recent reports @xcite from the planck collaboration support the inflationary idea on the density perturbation without a noticeable non - gaussianity .",
    "the inflationary idea is based on general relativity with an inflaton field(s ) which is a ` fundamental - scalar ' boson .",
    "indeed , the discovery of higgs boson as a fundamental scalar supports the ` fundamental - scalar ' inflaton idea and influences already in selecting possible allowed inflationary models @xcite . in this letter , we are interested in two fundamental scalars , the higgs boson and the very light axion @xcite .",
    "but the light ` fundamental - scalar ' from the planck mass or from the grand unification(gut ) mass(@xmath6 ) point of view is the so - called gauge hierarchy problem . because of",
    "the quadratic divergence of the ` fundamental - scalar ' mass , an extreme fine - tuning of boson mass parameters is needed and now , after the discovery of the higgs boson , we have the real ` fundamental - scalar ' mass problem .",
    "supersymmetry(susy ) is an attractive idea mildly extending the sm to reliably control the ` fundamental - scalar ' mass problem .",
    "the simplest extension is called the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , introducing a superpartner for every sm particle except for the higgs doublet .    for the higgs doublet",
    ", it is extended to one pair @xmath7 and @xmath8 and then supersymmetrized . in the mssm , however , there are two serious problems : the @xmath0 problem @xcite and the strong cp problem @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 term , @xmath9 , gives order @xmath0 higgs boson mass .",
    "the problem is that this @xmath0 term breaks no low energy symmetry and is naturally expected to be of order the planck scale @xmath10 or the gut scale @xmath11 .",
    "problem has been discussed long time ago with the pq symmetry @xcite , with supergravity effects @xcite and in string models @xcite .",
    "more recently , the discrete @xmath12 symmetry has been discussed also @xcite . ] in fig .",
    "[ fig : massscales ] in the first column , we show several interesting hierarchically separated mass scales of particle physics .",
    "the strong cp problem is a problem on how the qcd vacuum angle @xmath13 is bounded to the extremely small region , @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the most attractive solution is extending the sm again with a symmetry , _",
    "i.e.  _ via the peccei - quinn ( pq ) global symmetry @xcite , eventually leading to the invisible axion @xcite and axino by susy @xcite . however , the pq global symmetry is not warranted in gravitational interactions @xcite . even though no superpartner of the sm has not been found so far , still the susy extension seems most attractive for the ` light(_i.e .  _",
    "126gev ) ' higgs boson , possibly with susy manifested somewhat above tev , for example by the family dependent u(1 ) quantum numbers @xcite .",
    "so we continue to use susy here .    to understand small masses , we anticipate a scenario shown in the second column of fig .",
    "[ fig : massscales ] where zero mass is obtained in the first step .",
    "the goldstone boson idea may work for this .",
    "however , due to the gravity dilemma on global symmetries @xcite , we do not adopt a global symmetry .",
    "surprisingly , we find that if ` democracy ' among the same type of particles is present , some massless particles result , and even some approximate global symmetries can follow . in order to address the democracy problem with susy",
    ", we must spell out the @xmath0 problem . on this road",
    ", we obtain an approximate global symmetry which will be interpreted as an approximate pq symmetry .",
    "thus , the gravity argument against axion @xcite does not apply here since we never introduce the pq symmetry .",
    "so finally , the axion decay constant is related to the susy parameter @xmath0 , and sets a scale for the axion decay constant @xmath15 at the intermediate scale @xmath16 .",
    "is for the lowest order toward a natural solution , and the scale @xmath0 is generated at higher orders . here , @xmath16 the intermediate scale .",
    "]    obtaining massless particles naturally was considered long time ago for three families of fermions right after the discovery of @xmath17 and @xmath18 under the name of ` flavor democracy ' @xcite .",
    "the chief motivation of ref .",
    "@xcite was in order to obtain the heavy third family fermions , rather than to obtain two massless fermions of the first two families . for the flavor democracy of three up - type quarks ,",
    "one introduces the permutation symmetries on three flavors , independently for the left - handed(l ) fields and for the right - handed(r ) fields : @xmath19 .",
    "then , the mass matrix for the up - type quarks takes the form , @xmath20   { m_t}/{3}~ & { m_t}/{3}~   & { m_t}/{3}\\\\[0.5em ] { m_t}/{3}~ & { m_t}/{3}~   & { m_t}/{3 } \\end{array}\\right)\\ , ,   \\nonumber \\end{split}\\ ] ] leading to the mass eigenvalues of @xmath21 and 0 .",
    "this kind of @xmath22 is not helpful for obtaining just one pair of massless higgs doublets , or by susy one pair of massless higgsino doublets .",
    "therefore , to obtain just one massless pair of higgsino doublets in susy models , we need @xmath23 for two higgsino doublet pairs , @xmath24 with @xmath25 . here , @xmath26 is the interchange symmetry @xmath27 for two higgsino doublets @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "so is @xmath30 for two higgsino doublets",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 . due to susy , we identify the higgsino discrete symmetry @xmath23 with the higgs boson discrete symmetry @xmath33 , shortened as _ higgs - flavor - democracy_. if we start with just one pair of higgs doublets , we can not understand the _ fundamental problem of @xmath0 _ naturally .",
    "our solution of the @xmath0 problem is by introducing just two pairs of higgsino doublets at the gut scale @xmath11 .",
    "but , the unification of gauge coupling constants at a gut scale @xmath11 requires only one pair of higgs doublets @xmath34 at low energy @xcite , which is understood as in the second column of fig .",
    "[ fig : massscales ] with just one pair surviving below the gut scale .",
    "if the two higgsino pairs are not distinguished by any quantum number and geometry of the internal space , there must be the permutation symmetries , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "then , the democratic form for the higgsino mass matrix can be obtained , @xmath37 which gives higgsino mass eigenvalues @xmath38 and 0 .",
    "the _ higgs - flavor - democracy _   based on @xmath39 works as follows .",
    "the representation content of @xmath40 is only a singlet @xmath41 .",
    "the tensor product ( for the mass matrix ) of two @xmath40 singlets , _",
    "i.e.  _ @xmath42 and @xmath43 , contains two independent real parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 for the diagonal and off - diagonal combinations , respectively , @xmath46   \\epsilon_{\\alpha\\beta}\\label{eq : ws2 } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the su(2)@xmath49 gauge group indices of the sm .",
    "now , let us apply @xmath35 symmetry to @xmath50 : @xmath51 for @xmath52 , and @xmath53 for @xmath54",
    ". then , we obtain @xmath55   \\epsilon_{\\alpha\\beta}\\,.\\label{eq : ws2perm } \\end{split}\\ ] ] comparing eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ws2 ] ) and ( [ eq : ws2perm ] ) , we obtain @xmath56 and obtain the _ higgs - flavor - democracy _ , eq . ( [ eq : demo2 ] ) .",
    "applying @xmath36 gives the same result .",
    "but if we apply @xmath35 and @xmath36 simultaneously , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are not related .",
    "an @xmath39 invariant superpotential can be tried with @xmath57 note , however , that the @xmath58 term alone has an additional continuous symmetry so(2 ) . restricting to the discrete symmetry only , we set @xmath59 .",
    "the mass matrix is diagonalized to the new @xmath60 basis , @xmath61    indeed , one can find a few string models allowing two identical pairs of higgs doublets in the mssm @xcite .",
    "we note that ref .",
    "@xcite contains two pairs of higgs doublets in the twisted sector @xmath62 , has the _ higgs - flavor - democracy _ , and so naturally contains a light pair of higgs doublets .",
    "since the _ higgs - flavor - democracy _   gives one pair of the higgsino doublets zero mass , one has to break the _ higgs - flavor - democracy _   to obtain a tev scale @xmath0 , or",
    "the massless higgsino can never obtain mass . in the susy field theory framework",
    ", we show a possibility that the _ higgs - flavor - democracy _   is broken .",
    "let us take the minimal khler potential @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the gauge group non - singlet field such as the higgs superfield and @xmath65 and @xmath66 are gauge group singlet superfields , obeying the common @xmath1 symmetry of @xmath64 and @xmath67 , @xmath68 and similarly for the barred fields .",
    "let us introduce a very light qcd axion in the sm singlet fields @xcite , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , for @xmath71 .",
    "for the vevs of @xmath69 and @xmath70 not to be fine - tuned , the moduli from antisymmetric tensor @xmath72 are not suitable for the qcd axion since the corresponding decay constants are above @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "so , we assume that @xmath74 and @xmath75 are arising from some matter representations which are nontrivial representations of a subgroup of @xmath76 , for example .",
    "@xmath77 , @xmath74 and @xmath78 are higgs matter and they can be put in the same representations of a gut group , e.g. @xmath79 and @xmath80 . in this example , @xmath81 acts commonly on @xmath82 and @xmath74 , and @xmath83 acts commonly on @xmath84 and @xmath78 . then , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are not allowed and we consider only @xmath87 .",
    "let us consider the following @xmath88 symmetric non - renormalizable term @xcite , @xmath89 we have not included both @xmath90 and @xmath91 terms because in general @xmath92 in @xmath93 and @xmath94 in @xmath95 , being not moduli , can have different extra u(1 ) quantum numbers .",
    "also , there exists a string argument disallowing them @xcite . both terms of ( [ eq : knterm ] ) combine to parametrize interactions of the light fields . for the effective interaction of light fields , the fields with index @xmath96 matter , and",
    "detailed combinations are hidden and we will present it with the first term only . to have vevs of @xmath74 and @xmath97 fields ,",
    "let us consider an @xmath1 symmetric superpotential with a singlet @xmath98 @xcite , @xmath99 here , we removed the tadpole term of the @xmath92 and @xmath100 fields by an appropriate matter parity such as @xmath101 , and others with the even parity .",
    "there exists a flavor - democracy breaking minimum , @xmath102 .",
    "since there also exists the @xmath1 symmetric vacuum @xmath103 , our choice of democracy breaking minimum is spontaneous . at the democracy breaking vacuum , @xmath104 and @xmath105",
    ", we generate the following term @xmath106 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : diagbases ] ) and ( [ eq : knnumer ] ) , we obtain the following higgsino mass matrix @xmath107 where @xmath108 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath109 are @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "choosing @xmath15 at the intermediate scale @xmath112 , we obtain the tev scale @xmath0 .",
    "and @xmath113 .",
    "this generates the @xmath0 term and defines the pq charges .",
    "it can arise from a gut completed model shown on the rhs where @xmath114 are the gut scale inos . ]",
    "is a gut scale higgsino mass . ]    in the @xmath1 breaking vacuum , eq . ( [ eq : knnumer ] ) , integrating out the heavy fields @xmath115 , we have the light field interaction @xmath116 which was anticipated below eq .",
    "( [ eq : knterm ] ) .",
    "the higgs multiplets @xmath117 and @xmath118 couple to quarks , @xmath119 , and define their pq charges .",
    "then , the pq charges of @xmath120 and @xmath121 are given through eq .",
    "( [ eq : knlightpqdef ] ) . the diagram fig .",
    "[ fig : pqviolation ] breaks the pq symmetry , gives a correction to @xmath0 , which is smaller than fig .",
    "[ fig : dim5 ] by a factor @xmath122 .",
    "thus , the pq symmetry is approximate , and the explicit pq symmetry breaking term considering @xmath115 will lead to a very small @xmath123 term at the order @xmath124 , well below the current bound of @xmath125 @xcite .",
    "but the susy breaking must be considered , otherwise the axion is massless due to the massless gluino .",
    "then , the soft term(the a - term from fig .",
    "[ fig : pqviolation ] ) breaks the pq symmetry with the strength , @xmath126 \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath127 . to have @xmath128 , we need the extra contribution to the axion potential is no more than @xmath129 .",
    "so , in the gravity mediation scenario we need @xmath130 , or @xmath131 .",
    "one may guess that @xmath132 of fig .",
    "[ fig : dim5 ] is 1 if it appears from the gravity sector , but it is not so .",
    "the @xmath133 coupling for example arises from the rhs diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : dim5 ] , so that @xmath134 leads to @xmath135 where @xmath136 .",
    "taking @xmath137 , we need a product of yukawa couplings of @xmath138 .",
    "so , @xmath139 and @xmath140 each of order @xmath141 will satisfy this bound . in the gauge mediation scenario ,",
    "the gravitino mass is in the ev range and the resulting @xmath142 is completely negligible .",
    "note that the vev of @xmath143 ( and @xmath144 ) is the common scale for breaking the @xmath40 symmetry toward a nonzero @xmath0 and the axion decay constant @xmath15 , anticipated long time ago in @xcite , to realize the invisible axion @xcite . probably , it is a good rationale that the invisible axion scale is the intermediate scale @xmath16 .",
    "so , the axion mass is in the range @xmath145 @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that gravity is not respecting the pq global symmetry @xcite , and hence the components of the antisymmetric tensor field @xmath72 in string models @xcite and approximate global symmetries from string @xcite were tried for the qcd axion .",
    "so , the qcd axion based on the discrete symmetry even at the field theory level is circumventing all these worries .",
    "the effective pq symmetry we obtain here from the matter field @xmath143 and @xmath144 leads to a reasonable qcd axion from string .",
    "finally , we comment on how the solution of the @xmath0 problem is resolved in guts . for a complete gut example",
    ", we refer to the flipped su(5 ) guts @xcite from the @xmath146 orbifold compactification @xcite and from the fermionic string @xcite . in particular , we find two pairs of higgs doublets in the twisted sector @xmath147 of ref .",

    "but we present the discussion at the supersymmetric field theory level below .",
    "the gut higgs multiplets @xmath148 and @xmath149 have the infamous doublet - triplet splitting problem . in the flipped su(5 ) , it is resolved by coupling the color ( anti-)triplets in @xmath150 and @xmath151 to the color ( anti-)triplets in @xmath152 from @xmath153 and @xmath154 from @xmath155 by @xmath156 @xcite .",

    "thus , introducing @xmath179 and @xmath176 , we achieve the doublet - triplet splitting in the flipped su(5 ) gut .",
    "introducing a global symmetry in string models toward the strong cp solution by spontaneous breaking of the pq symmetry has been a dilemma for a long time . in this letter , we have found a mechanism to introduce it approximately on the way to solve the @xmath0 problem with _ higgs - flavor - democracy_. the underlying symmetry is the discrete @xmath39 symmetry for two identical pairs of higgs doublets , @xmath182 , at the high energy scale .",
    "being discrete , the @xmath39 symmetry can be realized in string models . in sum , it has not escaped our attention that two identical pairs of higgs doublets with supersymmetry introduce _ higgs - flavor - democracy _",
    ", bring one pair down to the tev scale solving the @xmath0 problem naturally , and predicts a very light axion .",
    "finally , we note that the underlying discrete symmetry is free from the gravity argument against the axion .",
