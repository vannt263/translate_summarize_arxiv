    "the neutrino flux from a core - collapse supernova ( sn ) is a powerful tool to probe fundamental neutrino properties as well as the dynamics of the explosion  @xcite .",
    "the diagnostic role played by neutrinos during a stellar collapse is largely associated with the signatures imprinted on the observable sn neutrino burst by flavor conversions occurring deep inside the star .",
    "it has been understood that the paradigm of neutrino flavor transformation in supernovae  @xcite , based primarily on the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) effect with the ordinary matter  @xcite , was incomplete .",
    "new surprising and unexpected effects have been found to be important in the region close to the neutrinosphere ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) . here",
    "the neutrino density is so high that the neutrino - neutrino interactions dominate the flavor evolution , producing collective oscillations .",
    "the most important observational consequence of @xmath0@xmath0 interactions is a swap of the @xmath1 and @xmath2 spectra with the non - electron @xmath3 and @xmath4 spectra in certain energy ranges  @xcite .",
    "the development of the spectral swaps is strongly dependent on the original sn neutrino fluxes . in the accretion phase ,",
    "i.e. @xmath5  ms after the core - bounce , neutrino number fluxes are expected to be ordered as @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "in such a scenario , one finds that for normal neutrino mass hierarchy ( nh , @xmath7 ) collective oscillations do not play a significant role . for inverted hierarchy ( ih , @xmath8 ) , the end of collective oscillations is marked by a complete exchange of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 flavors for almost all antineutrinos .",
    "for neutrinos , the exchange happens only above a characteristic energy fixed by the lepton number conservation , giving rise to a _",

    ", one finds a cross - over among the different @xmath0 spectra . as a consequence ,",
    "the original fluxes exhibit a different ordering @xmath11 .",
    "a study of this latter case was performed  @xcite , finding the occurrence of unexpected _ multiple spectral splits _ for both neutrinos and antineutrinos , in normal and inverted mass hierarchies .",
    "the rich phenomenology of the spectral splits , and its dependence on the original neutrino energy spectra was further explored in the extensive study performed in  @xcite .",
    "most of the collective flavor dynamics of sn neutrinos can be explained in an effective two - flavor ( 2@xmath0 ) framework  @xcite .",
    "collective oscillations are triggered by an instability in the two - flavor `` @xmath12-sector '' associated with the atmospheric mass - squared difference @xmath13 and the mixing angle @xmath14 .",
    "three - flavor ( 3@xmath0 ) effects are due to the `` @xmath15-sector , '' governed by the smaller solar mass splitting @xmath16 and the mixing angle @xmath17 .",
    "these effects have been studied for neutrino fluxes typical of the accretion phase  @xcite .",
    "it was recently shown @xcite that they are able to trigger collective flavor conversions , even if the mixing angle @xmath14 is exactly zero .",
    "however , apart from this initial kick , no new sizeable effect was found in the subsequent neutrino flavor evolution .",
    "recently , the 3@xmath0 case was studied for a scenario relevant to the cooling phase  @xcite .",
    "it was found that in the inverted mass hierarchy , the presence of the solar sector can `` erase '' the high - energy spectral splits that would have occurred in the @xmath1 and @xmath18 spectra for a @xmath19 flavor evolution governed by the @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , the final electron antineutrino energy spectrum exhibits a `` mixed '' nature , i.e. the spectral swap is not complete .",
    "the phenomenological importance of this result is underlined by the fact that the high - energy spectral features are expected to be significantly easier to observe at neutrino detectors . in",
    "@xcite these three - flavor effects are associated with an instability in the @xmath15 sector and to the subsequent non - adiabatic flavor evolution driven by @xmath20 . building on this insight , we find it worthwhile to take a closer look at the three - flavor effects during the cooling phase , and to understand the origin and nature of the 3@xmath0 instability .",
    "we explain how the 3@xmath0 effects are crucially dependent on the neutrino mass hierarchy . for normal mass hierarchy",
    ", there is no fundamental difference between @xmath12 and @xmath15 sectors , since in this case both mass splittings are positive and the effective in - medium mixing angles are both small .",
    "thus , even in a 2@xmath0 set - up one would expect spectral splits driven by the @xmath15-sector parameters , and expect them to be exactly where the splits appear in the case of @xmath12-sector in normal hierarchy .",
    "however we find that , it is not the case .",
    "in fact with typical sn parameters , collective oscillations fail to produce any significant conversions for the @xmath15-sector .",
    "this is so , because the @xmath15-sector has a lower natural frequency ( @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a typical sn @xmath0 energy ) than the @xmath12-sector and the collective interaction strength drops at a rate much faster than it .",
    "this does not leave enough time for the instability to grow and makes the collective evolution non - adiabatic . therefore",
    ", spectral splits fail to develop .",
    "nevertheless , the system is in an unstable situation . indeed , as we will show , a small perturbation in the initial conditions is enough to develop the collective flavor conversions , producing spectral swaps also in this two - flavor case .    in a realistic situation , this initial perturbation for the @xmath15-sector",
    "is provided by 3@xmath0 effects that couple this sector to the @xmath12-sector .",
    "oscillations in the @xmath12-sector are communicated to the @xmath15-sector , allowing the instability to grow much faster .",
    "the spectral swapping still remains less adiabatic than in the @xmath12-sector . as a result , for normal mass hierarchy - where both @xmath12 and @xmath15-sectors trigger the same instability and `` compete '' to convert the high - energy @xmath0 and @xmath23 spectra - the @xmath12-sector wins",
    "three - flavor effects do not cause a significant change .",
    "the interesting bit happens for inverted mass hierarchy . in this case , the @xmath12-sector and the @xmath15-sector have instabilities in different parts of the spectrum and therefore do not compete with each other .",
    "instead , they `` cooperate '' and act on complementary parts of the energy spectra .",
    "the @xmath15-sector instability catalyzed by the @xmath12-sector , operates in the high - energy region without hindrance , and causes an additional swap , that erases the spectral split found in the @xmath19 flavor evolution .",
    "the low adiabaticity in the @xmath15-sector is responsible for somewhat smeared splits , and the effect is particularly important for splits at higher energies , especially for the antineutrinos . in the remainder of this paper",
    ", we illustrate these aspects using simple examples and provide a semi - analytical treatment .",
    "the plan of our work is as follows . in section  2",
    ", we present our formalism for the sn neutrino flavor evolution and set up our numerical calculations , i.e. state our inputs for neutrino masses , mixing parameters , original supernova neutrino energy spectra and luminosities at late times . in section  3 ,",
    "we present the 2@xmath0 results in the @xmath12 and @xmath15 sectors , in particular showing the lack of adiabaticity in the @xmath15-sector and the role of the small perturbations in the initial conditions to circumvent that . in section  4",
    ", we present a complete 3@xmath0 calculation , showing that the @xmath12-sector catalyzes the @xmath15-sector and then instabilities in both sectors develop - in cooperation for inverted mass hierarchy , and in competition for normal mass hierarchy .",

    "the factor @xmath33 in the hamiltonian , implies `` multi - angle '' effects for neutrinos moving on different trajectories  @xcite .",

    ", we realize that in the two mass hierarchies the instabilities occur around different and well - separated crossing points .",
    "this leads to spectral swaps that occur in different energy ranges for the two mass hierarchies .",

    "this implies that if we take the @xmath0 spectra swapped by the conversions in ih , as an input for conversions in nh , these latter would swap also the high - energy spectrum of the electron ( anti)neutrinos , giving the impression that the high - energy split has been `` erased .",

    "however , we find that in this case no flavor conversion occurs .",
    "this has to be attributed to two reasons - insufficient growth of the instability , and lack of adiabaticity .",
    "the strength of the instability is given by the off - diagonal components in the density matrix .",
    "for a simple pendular system with energy @xmath22 , the time - period for growth of off - diagonal components is a few times the pendular time - period @xmath94  @xcite @xmath95 which scales logarithmically with the small in - medium mixing angle .",
    "this time period is roughly @xmath96 times larger for the @xmath15-sector , causing the instability to develop relatively slowly .",
    "the slow growth is further exacerbated by a relatively fast decrease in collective neutrino interaction strength @xmath63 .    during the spectral swapping phenomenon , the spectrum near the crossing acts like an inverted pendulum  @xcite .",
    "the swap sweeps through the spectrum on each side of the crossing , and the modes at the edge of the swap precess at an average oscillation frequency @xmath97  @xcite .",
    "adiabaticity requires  @xcite @xmath98 since the collective neutrino interaction strength @xmath63 goes as @xmath99 , the rate at which neutrino refractive effects are decreasing is @xmath100  km@xmath68 at @xmath101  km , approximately where the swapping takes place .",

    "however , as we will discuss later , due to the the less adiabatic behavior around the splitting region , the @xmath86-@xmath4 swap is not complete . finally , for @xmath159  mev @xmath146 and @xmath141 completely convert into each other and @xmath142 is stable",
    ".    in the upper panels of fig .  7",
    ", we show the neutrino ( left panels ) and antineutrino ( right panels ) spectra before and after the complete @xmath145 flavor conversions in inverted hierarchy . in the lower panel",
    "we show the corresponding @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 probabilities , which can be defined approximately as the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix are small at the end of the collective evolution .",
    "namely , these three probabilities read @xmath165 where @xmath166 and @xmath167 indicate the initial and final values of @xmath168 , respectively .",
    "we first consider the neutrino flavor evolution .",
    "as we have already discussed , the effects of the @xmath15 and @xmath12 systems process complementary parts of the neutrino energy spectra . indeed , as we can see from the conversion probabilities , in the energy range",
    "where @xmath169 , we have @xmath170 and viceversa .",
    "in particular , the solar mass splitting @xmath154 induces an electron survival probability @xmath171 at high - energies , erasing the @xmath12-sector high - energy split at @xmath91  mev , as was pointed out in  @xcite .",
    "thus , the final electron neutrino spectrum reads @xmath172 conversely , the behavior of the @xmath155 and @xmath10 spectra is the same as the that of the non - electron species in @xmath19 flavor evolution in ih and nh , respectively , i.e. @xmath173 and    @xmath174    indeed , the @xmath3 and @xmath150 spectra will be affected respectively only by the @xmath15 or the @xmath12 sector , since @xmath175 conversions are strongly suppressed as evident from the vacuum hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ hvac ] ) .",
    "one should note that while the high - energy spectral split is no longer present in the @xmath1 final energy spectrum , @xmath150 and @xmath3 final spectra still present this high - energy feature .",
    "therefore , msw effects in supernova , vacuum mixing and earth effects that occur later can make the high - energy split reappear in the observable electron neutrino spectra at earth .    moving on to the antineutrinos",
    ", we realize that the @xmath130 swap is not sharp , due to the imperfect adiabaticity in the @xmath15 sector .",
    "this implies that the swap of @xmath86 and @xmath4 spectra at intermediate energies ( @xmath176  mev @xmath177 @xmath178  mev ) is not complete and this explains the `` mixed '' @xmath86 spectrum , observed also in the numerical simulations in  @xcite .",
    "this effect has to be attributed to the low adiabaticity of the @xmath20-induced conversions , which is particularly visible for antineutrinos .",
    "the adiabaticity of a spectral split depends on the condition in eq .",
    "( [ eq : adia ] ) .",
    "the @xmath18 and @xmath179 spectra are closer to each other than the corresponding neutrino spectra .",
    "this implies that in the high - energy region , where the swap takes place , @xmath180 in the final phases of the swapping dynamics , the neutrino and antineutrino spectra evolve quite independently , and the precession frequencies of the two blocks are not governed by a common @xmath63 , but by individual @xmath63 s proportional to the flux differences in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fdiff ] ) .",
    "they behave essentially as two uncoupled oscillators because the neutrino - neutrino interaction @xmath63 is now smaller than the frequency difference of the two blocks .",
    "one can see this clearly in the numerical simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite , shown at  @xcite .",
    "the frequency @xmath181 is lower for antineutrinos  @xcite , and thus adiabaticity tends to be broken more severely for antineutrinos .      in fig .  8",
    ", we show the complete development of the @xmath146 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 components of the density matrix in normal hierarchy for neutrinos ( left panels ) and for antineutrinos ( right panels ) for different energy modes . for both neutrinos and antineutrinos ,",
    "the swapping dynamics occurs mainly between the @xmath146 and the @xmath142 , while @xmath141 experiences only nutations around its initial equilibrium value , before relaxing completely to it when the flavor conversions are saturated .",
    "therefore , the flavor evolution is close to the @xmath19 @xmath12-case in normal hierarchy discussed in sec .",
    "indeed , both @xmath13 and @xmath20 are positive",
    ". therefore , the @xmath15-sector would behave as a replica of the @xmath12-sector , but with a smaller mass splitting . in this condition ,",
    "both @xmath12 and @xmath15 sectors process the same regions of the electron neutrino energy spectra .",
    "however , the hierarchy between the two mass splittings produces the dominance of the @xmath121 swaps , while conversion effects in the @xmath122 sector remain inhibited by adiabaticity violation .",
    "the only region where the @xmath15-instability can compete with @xmath12 is very close to the split . in particular , for low - energy neutrino modes ( @xmath182  mev in fig .",
    "8) the @xmath146 comes back to its initial value , while at higher energies ( @xmath183  mev ) exchanges its initial value with @xmath142 . for the antineutrinos ,",
    "@xmath146 remains at its initial value for the modes at @xmath157  mev . at @xmath184  mev",
    ", we are around the splitting region where the adiabaticity in the @xmath12-system is more severely violated , and the @xmath9-@xmath155 conversions are not complete . under these conditions ,",
    "the @xmath15 instability can also play a role , producing a weak swap in @xmath141 .",
    "finally , at @xmath159  mev , conversions again occur only between @xmath9 and @xmath155 states , producing a complete swap of the initial @xmath146 and @xmath142 values .     for neutrinos ( left panels ) and antineutrinos ( right panels ) for different energy modes .",

    "the grey bands represent the region where the spectral swaps occur ( see text for details ) .",
    "[ fig:9 ] ]    in fig . 9 , we show the neutrinos ( left panels ) and antineutrino ( right panels ) spectra before and after the complete @xmath145 flavor conversions in nh . in the lower panels we represent the corresponding @xmath81 , @xmath185 and @xmath156 probabilities .",
    "once more , we realize that the flavor evolution can be mostly described in terms of two - flavor @xmath121 transitions , while the role of @xmath122 conversions is subleading .",
    "the spectral splitting features are remarkably similar to the ones found for the @xmath19 @xmath12-system in normal hierarchy ( sec .",
    "iii - a ) .",
    "in particular , the @xmath1 spectrum presents a single split at @xmath91  mev and @xmath116 spectrum around @xmath92  mev . only close to the splitting regions , we find subleading effects associated with @xmath122 conversions .",
    "collective neutrino flavor conversions in supernovae , associated with neutrino - neutrino interactions , have been recognized to induce peculiar spectral swaps among the different neutrino species .",
    "the development of these features is associated with instabilities in the flavor space . in particular",
    ", these instabilities would develop around the crossing points of the original sn neutrino spectra .",
    "then , the neutrino mass hierarchy determines if a crossing point is unstable under the effects of the collective oscillations .",
    "a particularly intriguing case is the one in which the original sn neutrino fluxes exhibit an ordering with @xmath11 , possible during the cooling phase . in this case",
    ", the two - flavor study realized by  @xcite , found the occurrence of multiple spectral splits for both neutrinos and antineutrinos , depending on the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "a recent numerical exploration of this case performed in  @xcite , has found that when three - flavor effects are taken into account in inverted mass hierarchy , the high - energy spectral swaps observed in the @xmath19 evolution are erased by effects related to @xmath20 .    motivated by this intriguing result ,",
    "in our paper we have performed a detailed study of the three - flavor effects in the collective oscillations for supernova neutrino spectra typical of the cooling phase .",
    "we have found that the effects of @xmath20 in the three - flavor evolution are important only in inverted mass hierarchy . in this case , the presence of @xmath20 gives rise to instabilities in regions of the neutrino energy spectra that were stable under the two - flavor evolution governed by @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , the combinations of these two different instabilities would produce a wash - out of the high - energy splitting features in the @xmath1 and @xmath86 spectra .",
    "conversely , in normal mass hierarchy the three - flavor instabilities and the two - flavor one act in the same regions of the neutrino energy spectrum , leading only to minor departures from the two - flavor evolution .",
    "essentially , the system behaves like a pendulum in @xmath145 flavor space .",
    "it can topple towards either the @xmath150 state or the @xmath3 state .",
    "in inverted hierarchy , when the @xmath12 and @xmath15 instabilities are in different regions of energy , the pendulum topples towards @xmath150 for the @xmath12-instability , and towards @xmath3 for the @xmath15-instability . in normal hierarchy ,",
    "when the instabilities are in the same region of energy , the pendulum topples towards @xmath150 , as the @xmath15-instability is relatively non - adiabatic .",
    "as a consequence , in inverted mass hierarchy the electron ( anti)neutrino spectrum at the end of the collective oscillations would present only a very low - energy ( @xmath186  mev ) splitting feature , being completely swapped to the original non - electron spectra at higher energies .",
    "we wish to emphasize that the high - energy splitting features may survive in the observable electron ( anti)neutrino spectrum at earth , even in inverted hierarchy .",
    "indeed , msw matter effects in sn , vacuum mixing and earth effects would further mix the @xmath1 and @xmath3 spectra .",
    "the non - electron spectrum at the end of the collective oscillations , still contains high - energy splitting features , since for the non - electron species the collective flavor conversions have occurred essentially as in the two - flavor case .",
    "therefore , especially for neutrinos , which have sharper spectral swaps , the electron neutrino signal at earth could still present observable splitting features at high energy .",
    "also , due to the lower neutrino luminosity at sufficiently late times , the initial collective interaction strength @xmath187 can be somewhat lower than is assumed in  ref.@xcite and this work .",
    "we found that in certain regions of the spectral parameter space , reducing @xmath187 by a factor of 10 makes the three - flavor effect disappear due to a stronger adiabaticity violation in the @xmath15 sector . in principle , this effect could produce interesting signatures in the time evolution of the sn neutrino signal .    in conclusion ,",
    "the non - linear equations that govern the flavor evolution of neutrinos emitted during a stellar collapse are a continuous source of surprises and new effects . during this last year",
    ", dramatic changes have occurred in the picture consolidated after the initial exploration of collective supernova neutrino oscillations .",
    "the discovery of this new three - flavor effect is the most recent of these changes .",
    "after our study , it appears that its impact on the collective neutrino flavor conversions is conceptually and quantitatively well under control .",
