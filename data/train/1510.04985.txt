    "the dirty boson problem is defined as a system of interacting bosons in a random potential @xcite . the combined effect of disorder and two - particle interaction represents one of the most challenging problems in condensed matter physics due to the intriguing interplay between localisation and superfluidity .",
    "cold atoms provide a controlled experimental setup in which that fundamental question of interacting bosons in a random environment can be addressed in both a quantitative and a tunable way .    the earliest relevant experiments , which were central for motivating the research of the dirty boson problem , dealt with superfluidity of thin films of @xmath0he adsorbed in porous vycor glass in the low - density limit @xcite .",
    "there it was proven that , despite the presence of disorder , superfluidity can still persist . for ultracold",
    "bose gases disorder appears either naturally as , e.g. , in magnetic wire traps @xcite , where imperfections of the wire itself can induce local disorder , or it may be created artificially and controllably as , e.g. , by using laser speckle fields @xcite . a set - up more in the spirit of condensed matter physics relies on a bose gas with impurity atoms of another species trapped in a deep optical lattice , so the latter represent randomly distributed scatterers @xcite .",
    "furthermore , an incommensurate optical lattice can provide a pseudo - random potential for an ultracold bose gas @xcite .",
    "non - interacting particles in a random environment can be localised provided that the disorder is sufficiently strong .",
    "this phenomenon of anderson localisation occurs as the particles are repeatedly reflected back in the random potential , so interferences yield exponentially localised one - body wave functions @xcite . in one dimension anderson localisation",
    "was experimentally found in an ultracold bose gas in references @xcite . within a bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) , which is a many - particle interacting system ,",
    "the presence of disorder causes the emergence of a new phase besides the superfluid phase ( sf ) , which is called a bose - glass phase due to the localisation of bosons in the respective minima of the random potential landscape .",
    "this bose - glass phase contains no superfluid fraction and is characterised by a finite compressibility , by the absence of a gap , and by an infinite superfluid susceptibility @xcite .",
    "indications for the existence of the bose - glass phase were found , for instance , in the experiments of references @xcite .",
    "there it was shown within the superfluid phase that an increasing disorder strength yields first a fragmentation of the condensate due to the formation of tiny bec droplets in the minima of the random environment .",
    "for sufficiently strong disorder the condensate then turns out to be completely destroyed as all bosons are localised in the minima of the random potential , which represents the bose - glass phase . but a more quantitative investigation of that elusive phase is still lacking both from an experimental and a theoretical point of view .",
    "one of the first important theoretical results of the dirty boson problem was obtained by huang and meng in 1992 @xcite . within a bogoliubov theory for a weakly interacting bose - einstein condensate",
    "it was found that a weak random disorder potential leads to a depletion of both the global condensate density and the superfluid density due to the localisation of bosons in the respective minima of the random potential @xcite . beyond the weak disorder ,",
    "a perturbative approach was worked out in references @xcite , where the impact of the external random potential upon the quantum fluctuations was studied in detail . in order to analyse the bec in the strong disorder regime , there are , in principle , two complementary non - perturbative approaches .",
    "the first starts from the superfluid phase and ends up in the bose - glass phase for increasing disorder strength . to this end reference",
    "@xcite applies the random phase approximation and yields a self - consistent integral equation for the disorder - averaged particle density , whereas references @xcite work out a stochastic self - consistent mean - field approach using two chemical potentials , one for the condensed and one for the exited particles .",
    "the second approach starts conversely from the bose - glass phase and proceeds towards the superfluid phase for decreasing disorder strength .",
    "for instance , references @xcite work this out on the basis of a careful energetic analysis , where the disorder turns out to strongly influence the size , shape , and structure of the mini - condensates in the minima of the random potential .",
    "furthermore , an order parameter was introduced and applied in the context of a hartree - fock theory in reference @xcite in order to describe the possible emergence of the bose - glass phase .",
    "the localisation due the presence of the disorder in one - dimensional bec systems was tackled in the literature in different directions . for instance",
    ", it was shown analytically that the one - dimensional gas of short - range - interacting bosons in the presence of disorder can undergo a finite - temperature phase transition between superfluid and insulator @xcite . furthermore , solving numerically and variationally the gross - pitaevskii equation of the weakly interacting bec in a weakly disordered lattice and a speckle potential , the localised bec s are found to have an exponential tail @xcite . using quantum monte carlo simulations it turned out that , surprisingly , disorder - induced phase coherence could occur @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the context of optical lattices , the quantum phase diagram of a dirty bec in one dimension was also investigated via different methods @xcite .",
    "reference  @xcite proved that approximative description of all quantum phases can be obtained via the site - dependent decoupling mean - field approach . by means of the density matrix renormalisation group technique ,",
    "the existence of a critical value of the disorder strength for the bose - glass phase was proven in reference @xcite .",
    "in addition , the exact bose - fermi mapping demonstrated that the superfluid bose - glass transition and the general phase diagram of trapped incommensurate optical lattices can be uniquely determined from finite - temperature density distributions of the trapped disordered system @xcite .",
    "despite all those previous investigations there is still a lack of knowledge concerning the emergence of the bose - glass phase and its elusive properties .    in the present paper",
    "we treat a quasi - one - dimensional trapped bec in a disorder potential both analytically and numerically . in particular , we focus on the question how the bosons , which are localised in the minima of the random potential , are distributed within the harmonic confinement . for sufficiently large disorder",
    "we even expect to find a bose - glass region in the trap , where the global condensate vanishes and only localised bosons exist .",
    "note that the corresponding three - dimensional trapped case is treated separately in reference @xcite .",
    "we start first by describing the underlying bec model and by developing a hartree - fock mean - field theory for the weak disorder regime and apply it within the thomas - fermi approximation to the dirty bec system in section [ ii ] . however ,",
    "since we study a system that is not fully amenable to the thomas - fermi approximation , we also employ numerical and variational treatment , described in section [ iii ] .",
    "we solve the corresponding gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation of the bec model , and then apply a variational ansatz for the intermediate disorder regime .",
    "the results of those three different methods are discussed and compared in section [ iv ] . for instance , we find that the density of fragmented mini - condensates is redistributed for increasing disorder strength . whereas for small disorder bosons tend to localise at the border of the trap , for intermediate disorder strength they concentrate in the trap centre .",
    "it has been suggested in reference @xcite that a gaussian - correlated disorder potential constitutes an appropriate model to describe realistic random landscapes .",
    "therein the final correlation length corresponds to the average width of the mountains or valleys in the disorder potential .",
    "such a gaussian correlation has been explored in more detail both for a bec with contact as well as dipole - dipole interaction in any geometry @xcite .",
    "qualitatively similar results are obtained for other disorder potentials with finite correlation lengths as , for instance , laser speckles @xcite and lorentz correlation @xcite .",
    "all these studies have in common that disorder effects typically decrease with increasing correlation length and are , thus , most pronounced for @xmath1-correlation .",
    "therefore , we restrict ourselves in the following to the case of @xmath1-correlation , to focus on the study of disorder effects .    the model of a three - dimensional weakly interacting homogeneous bose gas in a @xmath1-correlated disorder potential was studied within the hartree - fock mean - field theory in reference @xcite by applying the parisi replica method @xcite . as a result , the corresponding phase diagram for the occurrence of the superfluid , the bose - glass , and the normal phase was determined in the control parameter plane spanned by disorder strength and temperature .",
    "this hartree - fock theory is extended in reference @xcite to a harmonic confinement , and is applied in the following to one - dimensional systems .    to this end",
    ", we consider a model of one - dimensional harmonically trapped bec in a @xmath1-correlated disorder potential with contact interactions between the particles .",
    "the corresponding free energy is calculated in appendix  [ f ] and is given by equation .",
    "it depends on the superfluid order parameter @xmath2 , which represents the condensate density , the bose - glass order parameter @xmath3 , which stands for the density of atoms being localised in the local minima of disorder potential , and an auxiliary function @xmath4 .",
    "the self - consistency equations are obtained by extremizing the free energy with respect to these functions , i.e. , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "this yields , together with the particle number equation , four coupled equations : an algebraic equation for @xmath3 , @xmath8 a nonlinear differential equation for @xmath2 , @xmath9\\,\\sqrt{n_0(x)}=0\\ , , \\label{pmm-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the equation for the total density @xmath10 , which is sum of the previous two densities , @xmath11 and the auxiliary function @xmath4 , which is a solution of the cubic equation @xmath12q_0(x)^2-\\frac{m}{2}=0\\ , .\\label{q3}\\ ] ] here @xmath13 denotes the strength of disorder , as defined in appendix  [ f ] .",
    "note that in the clean case ( @xmath14 ) equations  reduce to the standard gross - pitaevskii theory .",
    "furthermore , for finite disorder strength @xmath13 the homogeneous case , where @xmath15 , is treated semi - analytically in appendix  [ homogeneous ] .",
    "there it is shown that increasing the disorder strength @xmath13 yields a first - order quantum phase transition from the superfluid to the bose - glass phase .",
    "for the harmonically trapped case , however , no analytic approach is known which gives the exact solution of the differential equation even in the absence of disorder .",
    "therefore , we approximate its solution via the thomas - fermi ( tf ) approximation method , which is based on neglecting the kinetic energy . to this end , it turns out that we have to distinguish between two different spatial regions : the superfluid region , where the bosons are distributed in the condensate as well as in the minima of the disorder potential , and the bose - glass region , where there are no bosons in the global condensate so that all bosons contribute only to the local bose - einstein condensates . in the following the radius of the superfluid region ,",
    "i.e. , the condensate radius , is denoted by @xmath16 , while the radius of the whole bosonic cloud @xmath17 is called the cloud radius .    within the tf approximation the algebraic equations , , and",
    "remain the same , but the differential equation reduces to an algebraic relation in the superfluid region : @xmath18 outside the superfluid region , i.e. , in the bose - glass region , equation reduces simply to @xmath19 .",
    "the advantage of the tf approximation is that now we have only four coupled algebraic equations .    at",
    "first we consider the superfluid region . in the tf approximation",
    "the dependency on the auxiliary function @xmath4 in equation can be eliminated and equations , , and reduce in the superfluid region to : @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the dimensionless total density , @xmath22 the dimensionless condensate density , @xmath23 the dimensionless bose - glass order parameter , @xmath24 the dimensionless coordinate , @xmath25 the maximal total density in the clean case , @xmath26 the dimensionless chemical potential , @xmath27 the dimensionless disorder strength , @xmath28 the coherence length in the centre of the trap , @xmath29 the oscillator length , and @xmath30 the tf cloud radius in the clean case , i.e. , when @xmath14 .",
    "the chemical potential in the absence of the disorder @xmath31 , which provides the energy scale , is deduced from the normalisation condition in the clean case .",
    "inserting equations and into equation gives us one self - consistency equation for the condensate density in the superfluid region : @xmath32    this equation is of sixth order with respect to @xmath33 , which makes it impossible to solve analytically .",
    "therefore , we solve it numerically and insert the result into equations and in order to determine the bose - glass order parameter @xmath34 and the total density @xmath35 , respectively .",
    "now we come to the bose - glass region , where we have from equation in tf approximation @xmath36 , and equation reduces to @xmath37 . inserting this into equation ,",
    "we get @xmath4=@xmath38 , which reduces equation to : @xmath39    we also need to write down the dimensionless equivalent of the normalisation condition @xmath40 , which reads : @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the dimensionless cloud radius , and the total density @xmath35 in equation is the combination of the total densities from both the superfluid region and the bose - glass region .    before considering any particular parameter value for our bec system ,",
    "we have first to justify using the tf approximation and determine its range of validity . to this end",
    "we rewrite equation in the clean case , i.e. , for @xmath14 , and divide it with @xmath43 .",
    "this yields :    @xmath44\\,\\sqrt{\\tilde{n}(\\tilde{x})}=0\\ , .\\label{pmm-1 - 1 - 3}\\ ] ]    note that in the clean case the total density coincides with the condensate one .",
    "the tf approximation is only justified when the prefactor of the kinetic term @xmath45 is small enough , so the kinetic term can be neglected , which yields @xmath46 the corresponding tf results are presented and discussed in section [ iv ] . in order to asses their validity , in particular for large disorder strengths , however , we turn first to two other complementary approaches to the dirty bec problem .",
    "in this section we start with working out a numerical method that relies on solving the gross - pitaevskii equation for an ensemble of realisations of disorder landscape .",
    "furthermore , we also introduce a variational approach , which is tailored to describe the numerical results analytically .",
    "now we perform a numerical study for the bose - condensed gas in one dimension at zero temperature in a harmonic trapping potential @xmath47 .",
    "furthermore , we assume a gaussian - distributed disorder potential @xmath48 , which satisfies the conditions @xmath49 and @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the correlation function .",

    "we have first to generate the random potential @xmath48 before inserting it into equation @xmath54 , and then calculate the disorder average over many realisations of @xmath48 .",
    "motivated by fourier series , a simple ansatz for generating a random gaussian function @xmath48 is performed as follows .",
    "the potential is written as a finite superposition of @xmath55 and @xmath56 terms with properly selected amplitudes @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and wave numbers @xmath59 @xcite :    @xmath60    where @xmath61 denotes the number of terms , which should be large enough in order to obtain a good approximation for the random potential .",
    "furthermore , we assume@xmath62 and@xmath63to be mutually independent gaussian random variables with zero mean , and variance equal to @xmath64 : @xmath65        the wave numbers @xmath59 are independent random variables , as well , selected from the probability distribution : @xmath66 where @xmath67 defines the spectral density as the fourier transform of the correlation function :    @xmath68    in the special case of the gaussian - correlated disorder we have @xmath69 where @xmath70 denotes the correlation length and @xmath13 the disorder strength .",
    "the probability distribution reads in this case : @xmath71 note that the analytical study in section [ ii ] is done for @xmath1-correlated disorder , but since it is impossible to treat the @xmath1-correlated disorder numerically , we use the gaussian - distributed disorder , which specialises to a @xmath1-distributed one in the limit @xmath72 , i.e. , @xmath73    in order to numerically generate the correlation function with sufficient accuracy , two numbers have to be appropriately large enough .",
    "the first one is the number @xmath74 of terms in equation , the second one is the number @xmath75 of realisations of the disorder potential , which are used to evaluate the disorder ensemble average .",
    "it can be shown analytically that the error in reproducing the correlation function in the case @xmath76 is of the order of @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "all gaussian - correlated quantities are generated using the box - m \" ulller algorithm @xcite .",
    "we insert the generated disorder potential into the gross - pitaevskii equation , and then use a c computer program that solves the time - independent gross - pitaevskii equation in one space dimension in a harmonic trap using the imaginary - time propagation @xcite . in this way",
    "we obtain the numerical solution of the ground - state wave function @xmath52 of equation for @xmath78 realisations of the disorder potential and @xmath79 terms in equation . to this end",
    "we use different values of the disorder strength @xmath13 in order to cover the range from the weak to the intermediate disorder regime .",
    "we have chosen the disorder correlation length to be @xmath80 , which is small enough in order to approach the case of @xmath1-correlated disorder .",
    "performing disorder ensemble averages , we have access to the particle density @xmath81 , to the condensate density @xmath82 , and to the bose - glass order parameter @xmath83 . in order to compare the numerical results with the analytical ones obtained in section [ ii ]",
    ", we use the same rescaling parameters for all densities , coordinates , chemical potential , and disorder strength , as already explained below equation .    before discussing the numerical results in detail ,",
    "we show first one typical example in two graphs in figure  [ fig:1 ] , where the total density @xmath35 is plotted for two different values of the disorder strength ( solid , green line ) , showing the original data for @xmath78 and @xmath79 terms in equation .",
    "we remark that the resulting density is fluctuating around a gaussian - like curve . comparing figure",
    "[ fig:1](a ) with figure  [ fig:1](b ) we conclude that the fluctuations are increasing with the disorder strength .",
    "the origin of those fluctuations is that the @xmath78 realisations of the disorder potential for performing the disorder ensemble average are not sufficient to produce a smooth curve .",
    "one solution of this problem would be to increase the number @xmath75 of the realisations of the disorder potential , which would need longer execution time , especially for the intermediate disorder regime , where the numerics has to be run for a larger spatial range .",
    "another solution is to extract a continuous smooth curve that fits best to our data , as it is done in figure  [ fig:1 ] ( dotted - dashed , red line ) .",
    "this method is applied to all numerical densities in this paper .",
    "furthermore , from the gaussian fit in figure  [ fig:1 ] ( dotted , blue line ) , we remark that the original data of the total density approach a gaussian form in the intermediate disorder regime much better than in the weak disorder regime . this can be explained with the argument that increasing the disorder reduces effectively the repulsive interaction between the particles @xcite and , thus , approaches the case of non - interacting bosons , where the total density is given by a gaussian .",
    "since the four self - consistency equations  are obtained by extremizing the free energy , we can apply the variational method in the spirit of references @xcite to obtain approximate results . in order to be able to compare the variational results with the analytical and the numerical ones from section [ ii ] and the previous subsection , respectively ,",

    "the first notable difference compared to tf results is that the condensate and the cloud radius are not clearly defined , since the densities do not vanish at a well - defined point , but gradually converge to zero at the respective borders .",
    "therefore , we define the corresponding radii , which , for simplicity , we again denote by @xmath140 and @xmath126 , by the conditions @xmath141 and @xmath142 , where @xmath143 represents a conveniently chosen small number . from figures  [ fig:4](a ) and [ fig:4](d ) we see that the cloud radius increases with increasing disorder strength , while the maximal density at the trap centre decreases . figures  [ fig:4](b ) and [ fig:4](e ) show the same type of behaviour for the condensate , and generally reveal good agreement between the full numerical and variational results , as for the total density .",

    "thus , the main difference between the weak and the intermediate disorder regime is that the local condensates concentrate at the border of the condensate in the former case , but sit in the trap centre in the latter case . despite this marked difference , using either method yields that the width as well as the maximum of the bose - glass order parameter increase with the disorder strength .    in order to obtain further information on the behaviour of the system , we plot in figures  [ fig:5](a ) and [ fig:5](c ) the numerical and variational fractional number of condensed particles @xmath138 and fractional number of particles in the disconnected mini - condensates @xmath146 , as functions of the disorder strength , respectively .",
    "the condensed fraction @xmath138 decreases with the disorder strength and , conversely , @xmath146 increases , meaning that more and more particles are leaving the condensate with increasing @xmath132 .",
    "unfortunately , the employed numerical algorithm breaks down for larger values of the disorder strength , and one would have to use other approaches in this case . starting from the disorder strength value @xmath147",
    ", the variational equations turn out to have only complex solutions , so we can not extract further information about our system for higher disorder strengths using this approach .",
    "therefore , we focus on the regimes of weak to moderate disorder .",
    "numerically and variationally calculated cloud radius @xmath126 and the condensate radius @xmath140 , as defined in this subsection , are plotted in figures  [ fig:5](b ) and [ fig:5](d ) as functions of the disorder strength , respectively .",
    "both radii are almost identical in the weak disorder regime , and afterwards both increase linearly with the disorder strength in the moderate disorder regime . since the applied method breaks down for larger disorder strengths , we can not determine if a quantum phase transition exists , and this question remains still open .",
    "now we compare the physical quantities obtained via the three different methods : the tf approximation , the numerical method , and the variational method .",
    "for the small disorder strength @xmath103 , the three total densities @xmath35 in figure  [ fig:6](a ) agree qualitatively well , but quantitatively the tf - approximated function @xmath35 is a better approximation for the numerical total density , especially in the centre of the bosonic cloud , where the variational result does not agree well with the numerical one .",
    "the same remark can be made for the condensate density @xmath102 in figure  [ fig:6](b ) . for the bose - glass order parameter @xmath34 in figure",
    "[ fig:7](c ) the double - bump structure , which exists in both numerical and tf - approximated results , is missing in the variational result , which has just a bell form , as assumed by the variational ansatz .",
    "this makes again the tf - approximated bose - glass order parameter @xmath34 a better approximation for the numerical one .    for the moderate disorder strength @xmath148 ,",
    "the tf - approximated total density @xmath35 in figure  [ fig:6](d ) is also a better approximation for the numerical one in the centre of the bosonic cloud , while at the trap borders the variational approximation wins . according to the tf results shown in figure  [ fig:3 ] , at the disorder strength value @xmath148 we are already in the bose - glass phase ,",
    "thus , the tf - approximated condensate density @xmath102 in figure  [ fig:6](e ) vanishes .",
    "this is not the case for both the numerical and the variational condensate densities , which are compatible and match quite well at trap borders .",
    "the variational bose - glass order parameter @xmath34 in figure  [ fig:6](f ) also agrees well with the numerical one and both have the same bell shape , while the tf - approximated bose - glass order parameter has a significant deviation , which is expected since the tf approximation breaks down in the moderate disorder regime .    in figures  [ fig:7](a ) and",
    "[ fig:7](b ) we see that the variational and the numerical condensate radius @xmath140 and cloud radius @xmath126 have the same behaviour , namely both increase with the disorder strength .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the tf result , where the condensate radius is found to decrease with @xmath132 , evenatually leading to a quantum phase transition at @xmath133 .",
    "such a quantum phase transition is predicted only in tf approximation , which is known to fail for moderate disorder strengths .",
    "the question that still remains to be answered concerns the possible existence of the quantum phase transition from the superfluid to the bose - glass phase for large disorder strengths .",
    "according to reference @xcite , the disorder has to energetically overcome the interaction in order to yield such a quantum phase transition .",
    "however , numerical and variational results displayed in figure  [ fig:7](a ) suggest that this is not the case neither in the weak nor in the moderate disorder regime",
    ". one would have to investigate much stronger disorder regime , employing a different set of methods , in order to be able to detect a possible quantum phase transition , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "from the discussion in the previous section , we conclude that the tf approximation yields good results for the quasi - one - dimensional dirty bosons in the weak disorder regime , which agree well with the numerical ones , especially in the centre of the bosonic cloud , where the kinetic energy can be neglected .",
    "however , this approximation breaks down in the moderate disorder regime , and is unable to describe the dirty bec system properly . the origin of this failure is the fact that the condition is not fulfilled in the moderate disorder regime . the coherence length becomes significantly larger as we increase the disorder strength , especially at the border of the bosonic cloud , and when it becomes of the order of the thomas - fermi radius , the tf approximation breaks down .",
    "furthermore , quantum fluctuations are more prominent in lower dimensions , which also restricts the validity range of the tf approximation . on the other side , the variational method with the ans",
    "\" atze  turns out to be a good approximation to describe the dirty bec system in the moderate disorder regime and works there better than in the weak disorder regime , especially at the cloud border , where the bose - glass region is located .",
    "this is due to the fact that a stronger disorder reduces significantly the repulsive interaction between the particles and approaches the case of non - interacting bosons , where the densities are gaussian - like , as in our variational ans \" atze .",
    "although the variational method breaks down for larger disorder strengths , it still provides results in an important range of disorder strengths .",
    "the combination of applying the tf approximation for the weak disorder together with the variational method for the moderate disorder covers a significant range of disorder strengths . with this",
    "we can analytically describe the redistribution of the local disconnected mini - condensates from the edge of the atomic cloud to the trap centre for increasing disorder strengths , as obtained from detailed numerical simulations .",
    "we expect that all these results are useful for a quantitative analysis of experiments for dirty bosons in quasi - one - dimensional harmonic traps .",
    "the problem of the large disorder strengths still persists with the current approach and remains to be addressed by other methods .",

    "note that the latter has to be large enough , i.e. , @xmath161 , in order to ensure a quasi - one - dimensional setup @xcite .",
    "we assume for the disorder potential @xmath48 that it is homogeneous after performing the disorder ensemble average ( denoted by @xmath162 ) over all possible realisations .",
