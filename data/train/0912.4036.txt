    "tensor theories of gravity have played crucial role in addressing various issues in gravity and cosmology in diverse contexts ( viz problem of dark energy , inflation , late time acceleration of the universe , quintessence , cosmic evolution etc . ) in recent years @xcite . besides these issues ,",
    "the appearance of black hole ( bh ) , singular and nonsingular solutions in a scalar  tensor theory @xcite with some other closely related issues @xcite are also of crucial interest .",
    "in particular , the naked singularities asserting the violation of the weak cosmic censorship hypothesis ( wcch ) @xcite seem to appear in many realisations of gravitational collapse for spherical @xcite and non - spherical symmetric systems @xcite . at observational front , such violation of wcch would inherently be connected to some sorts of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) @xcite and gravitational lensing by naked singularities @xcite .",
    "+ the use of a higgs - like scalar field in a jordan  brans  dicke ( jbd ) model of gravity @xcite is of quite significant importance due to the role of higgs potentials in mass generation mechanisms and as cosmological - function ( anti - gravitational ) term and quintessence @xcite .",
    "in fact , anti - gravitational behaviour in such model leads to schwarzschild bhs which do not appear in the usual sense for non - vanishing and decaying scalar - field excitations .",
    "both the metric and scalar field are regular everywhere for non - vanishing excitations with exception of @xmath0 as naked singularity @xcite . for negative scalar - field excitations ,",
    "the metric components evolve with three different patterns depending on the amplitude of the scalar - field excitation where the horizons vanish for the central symmetry .",
    "it is therefore meaningful to further investigate the nature of quintessential behaviour of the bh and singular solutions of the field equations of this model with the precise role of scalar - field excitations ( @xmath1 ) in analogy to the well known reissner ",
    "nordstrm ( rn ) solutions @xcite .",
    "in order to relate new effects to usual dynamical quantities , we have therefore addressed the quintessential properties of the present induced model of gravity in the context of rn solutions which are valid especially for non - strong gravitational regimes .",
    "such analysis also portrays the role of scalar field and pressure in the dynamics in view of the vanishing of singularities and bh solutions .",
    "+ the plan of this paper is as follows : we first briefly recall the formalism of the scalar  tensor theory of gravity with a higgs field in section ii .",
    "we look for the solutions of the field equations for non - vanishing scalar - field excitations by using a series - expansion method in section iii . a rn - like bh solution having anti - gravitational features",
    "is derived , and both the mass and charge parameters of the solution are found to depend on the pressure terms related to the scalar field . for physical interpretation of the solutions obtained which",
    "are also valid for weak fields , we compare them with the linear solutions of an almost - flat metric in section iv .",
    "the linear poisson equation comprising the scalar field possesses pressure terms , and these act within dynamical , effective masses . in view of the geodesic motion",
    ", we then implement the results of section iii on rotation curves in section v and discuss the effective potential in terms of its bounding properties in view of the large astronomical distances and relatively weak gravitational fields as expected beyond galactic bulges .",
    "we also discuss the notion of effective and dynamical mass in contraposition to the luminous mass as derived from usual density .",
    "finally , we conclude our findings with possible future directions in section vi .",
    "let us quickly review the formalism of the scalar  tensor theory of gravity with a higgs potential in this section .",
    "remarkably , both the brans  dicke and higgs scalar fields are inherently well - connected to the problem of _ origin of mass _ in nature , which is evident from their following role respectively : + ( i ) in a jbd theory , a scalar field shares the stage with gravity , and as such it is compatible with the notions of mach s principle ( i.e. inertia as gravitation ) @xcite .",
    "the gravitational constant thus depends on the ( gravitational ) mass distribution in the universe , and it is replaced with the inverse of the brans  dicke scalar field .",
    "further , in a prototype jbd model with a broken - symmetric theory of gravity motivated from the smallness of the coupling constants of weak and gravitational interactions as well as the commonality in their dimensions , the gravitational coupling itself can be generated in terms of the vev of a scalar field @xcite .",
    "+ ( ii ) a higgs field is source of the inertial mass of the elementary particles in the standard model ( sm ) and various other unification schemes . the elementary constituents ( particles ) in such theories acquire mass only in the broken phase of symmetry while they are massless before the breakdown of the symmetry . a higgs field may therefore serve as a scalar field in a scalar ",

    "dynamically speaking , such systems with @xmath159 and @xmath160 are _ quintessentially attracted_. in fact , these systems are quintessential because of the anti - gravitational behaviour of @xmath146 following the negative effective ( yet positive actual ) mass .",
