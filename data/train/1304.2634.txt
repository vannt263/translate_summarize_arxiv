    "systems of ultracold bosonic gases in optical lattices have recently become a major field in physics research @xcite . after their theoretical suggestion @xcite and first experimental realization using counter - propagating laser beams",
    "@xcite it soon became clear that they establish a versatile bridge between the field of ultracold quantum matter and correlated condensed matter systems @xcite .",
    "one of the most famous examples is the bose - hubbard model @xcite which undergoes a quantum phase transition from a mott insulator to a superfluid phase due to the competition between the atom - atom on - site interaction and the hopping amplitude .",
    "this transition can be demonstrated experimentally by time - of - flight absorption pictures @xcite , or measuring the collective excitation spectra via bragg spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "recent research efforts have targeted more complex systems , which include long - range interactions ( e.g. from dipolar bosons @xcite ) , mixtures of several components @xcite and more interesting lattice geometries , such as frustrated or superlattice structures @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the corresponding phase diagrams become richer and more complex , including the possibility of phases with periodic density modulations or supersolidity . a crystalline density wave phase , for instance ,",
    "generally occurs at fractional filling and it has been proposed that the corresponding commensurate density modulation could be detected by measuring correlations with time - of - flight and noise - correlation techniques @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent experimental progress in achieving single - site addressability in optical lattice structures @xcite nourishes the prospect to directly observe density wave modulations in the near future .",
    "such density modulations may emerge from interactions via spontaneous symmetry - breaking , but a a simpler way to create them is with a superlattice generated from commensurate lasers , see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite for further experimental details .",
    "thus , then the potential depth is slightly different on one sublattice , while the interaction strength and hopping amplitude will remain almost uniform .",
    "the corresponding bose - hubbard model hamiltonian on a square or cubic lattice is given by @xcite @xmath0 where @xmath1 stands for a small additional chemical potential on sublattice @xmath2 compared to sublattice b , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "as we will show this model exhibits an interesting competition between mott and density wave phases .    from a theoretical point of view",
    "the study of interacting bosons and quantum phase transitions is far from trivial @xcite .",
    "the possible phases in different kinds of optical superlattices have so far been analyzed by numerical approaches @xcite , decoupled mean field theory @xcite , multisite mean - field theory @xcite and cell strong - coupling expansion method @xcite .",
    "the latter method yields excellent results for @xmath3d systems when compared to the powerful numerical method of ref .",
    "however , it is known that mean - field theory can have significant deviations from unbiased high - precision numerical results @xcite and the strong - coupling expansion is not that accurate when applied to higher dimensional systems .",
    "the purpose of this paper is , therefore , to present a reliable quantitative method to determine non - trivial phases of high - dimensional multi - component boson systems . to this end",
    "we profit from recent advances to use a systematic landau theory with an effective potential that can be estimated quantitatively from the microscopic model , e.g.  by diagrammatic methods @xcite . whereas the first hopping order of the effective potential landau theory leads to similar results as mean - field theory @xcite",
    ", higher hopping orders have recently been evaluated via the process - chain approach @xcite , which determines the location of the quantum phase transition for the single component hubbard model for cubic as well as triangular and hexagonal optical lattices to a similar precision as demanding quantum monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "thus , it becomes even possible to calculate the critical exponents of the corresponding quantum phase transition @xcite .",

    "apart from the mott insulator phases , we also found competing dw phases with fractional filling factors which are induced by the translational symmetry breaking of the superlattice system .",
    "the dimensionality has a similar effect on the mott insulator and the dw phases .",
    "compared with the decoupled mean - field theory , the geplt has a higher accuracy and does not suffer from the local minimum problem .",
