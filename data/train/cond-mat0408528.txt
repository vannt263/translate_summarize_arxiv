    "however , the collision rate of a fermion - fermion mixture at low temperatures is limited by the pauli blocking of collisions as a result of the occupation of final states around the fermi level and , in the case of a boson - fermion mixture , the collisionality can be strongly diminished by superfluidity of the condensate @xcite . on the other hand ,",

    "the physical observable that identifies the dynamical regime of the gas is the quantum collision rate @xmath32 . in the collisionless regime the atoms collide only rarely and we have @xmath33 , while if @xmath34 the gas is in a collisional regime which can be well described by hydrodynamic equations . in the general case",
    "a kinetic treatment is necessary such as the one used in this work .",
