    "massive early - type galaxies have globular cluster ( gc ) systems that follow bimodal color distributions ( e.g. , gebhardt & kissler - patig 1999 ; larsen et  al .",
    "2001 ; harris et  al .  2006",
    "; peng et  al .  2006 , hereafter p06 ) .",
    "before this was a commonly recognized feature of such systems , ashman & zepf ( 1992 ) discussed the possibility of gc color bimodality based on the simple idea that ellipticals are the remnants of dissipationally merged pairs of spirals ( e.g. , toomre 1977 ) . in this picture , a merger - formed population of red , relatively high - metallicity gcs would then appear distinct from the blue , metal - poor gcs of the progenitor spirals .",
    "the actual formation histories of ellipticals appear to have been more complex ( see for example the review by renzini 2006 ) . in particular , most of the stars in large ellipticals today are believed to have formed early , in a series of rapid starbursts at redshifts @xmath0 , whereas the hierarchical assembly of these galaxies continued to @xmath1 through `` dry '' ( dissipationless ) mergers ( e.g. , de lucia et  al .",
    "2006 ; menci et  al .  2008",
    "; kodama et  al .",
    "2007 ; thomas et  al .",
    "such hierarchical formation models do not naturally produce bimodal gc metallicity distributions in most elliptical galaxies ( beasley et  al .",
    "2002 ; kravtsov & gnedin 2005 ) . instead",
    ", the stochastic nature of the formation would be expected to result in approximately gaussian distributions .",
    "thus , while some galaxies with quiet histories like the milky way s may have bimodal gc metallicity distributions if they formed their stars in just a few discrete bursts , it is difficult to see how bimodality would be nearly universal in this context .",
    "an alternative model was put forth by c^ ot ' e  et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) in which ellipticals _ form _ with unimodal , relatively rich gc metallicity distributions and later acquire the blue gc component through dissipationless mergers with early - type dwarfs .",
    "this explanation appears more consistent with hierarchical formation models .",
    "however , the universality of the bimodality , even at intermediate luminosities , and the asymmetric tail of red gcs in dwarf ellipticals , would again be surprising in this scenario",
    ".    models of gc color distributions have typically assumed linear conversions between metallicity and optical colors .",
    "the observed color bimodality thereby became equated with bimodality in metallicity . in contrast , p06 showed that the empirical transformation from metallicity to the broad - baseline @xmath2  color is distinctly nonlinear .",
    "an earlier indication of such nonlinearity for the @xmath3 color index ( harris & harris 2002 ; cohen et  al .",
    "2003 ) has also been confirmed ( lee et  al .",
    "further , yoon et al .  ( 2006 ) pointed out that nonlinear color - metallicity relations predicted by their simple stellar population ( ssp ) models naturally produce bimodal color histograms from unimodal metallicity distributions .",
    "such nonlinearities are commonly predicted by realistic ssp models that try to reproduce the structure in stellar color - magnitude diagrams as a function of metallicity ( see cantiello & blakeslee 2007 , hereafter cb07 ) .",
    "this provides an alternative , simple explanation for the near - universality of bimodal gc color distributions , although the idea remains controversial as we discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] below .",
    "it is not surprising that as observations and models improve , deviations from the simplest linear assumptions become important .",
    "a related example is the dependence of galaxy surface brightness fluctuation magnitudes on integrated color : linear fits sufficed at the level of accuracy of ground - based data , but the latest _ hst",
    "_  studies ( mei et  al .  2007 ;",
    "blakeslee et  al .",
    "2009 ) clearly show a wavy relation reminiscent of that between metallicity and color .",
    "galaxy scaling relations are another example where nonlinearity has become evident amid the continuity of structural properties in new samples of galaxies spanning many orders of magnitude ( c^ ot ' e  et  al .",
    "even the cepheid period - luminosity relation has been found to exhibit significant nonlinearity ( ngeow et  al .",
    "although the errors in derived quantities ( e.g. , distance modulus or metallicity ) resulting from such nonlinearities are often small for individual objects , the implications for the distributions of these quantities derived for large populations can be profound .",
    "another development has been the discovery that gcs in the blue peak of the color distribution tend to be redder at brighter magnitudes ( harris et  al .",
    "2006 ; mieske et  al .",
    "2006 ; strader et  al .",
    "dubbed `` the blue tilt , ''",
    "the effect is subtle , but further evidence confirms it is real ( harris 2009 ; peng et  al .",
    "the likely explanation is that the most massive gcs were able to self - enrich to a small extent , thus producing a mass - metallicity relation ( e.g. , dopita & smith 1986 ; morgan & lake 1989 ; brown et  al .",
    "1991 ; recchi & danziger 2005 ; strader & smith 2008 ; bailin & harris 2009 ) . the tendency is much less obvious for the red - peak gcs , despite the otherwise lockstep behavior of the two peaks , which is strong evidence that they formed under similar conditions ( p06 ; larsen et  al.2001 ) .",
    "however , the red peak is broader because of the nonlinear color - metallicity relation , and it usually does not reach as high in optical luminosity , at least partly because of the decrease in luminosity - to - mass ratio with increasing metallicity . a weak `` red tilt '' is expected theoretically ( bailin & harris 2009 ) , and there is evidence for this in some cases ( mieske et  al .",
    "2006 ; lee et  al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "the purpose of this work is to bring together these two recent developments in the study of extragalactic gc systems : we explore the nature of the blue tilt in the context of unimodal metallicity distributions with nonlinear dependence of color on metallicity . to do this",
    ", we assume a mass - metallicity relation consistent with the findings of recent studies .",

    "the final section summarizes our conclusions .",
    "our goal is to investigate the presence and significance of the `` blue tilt ''  the color - magnitude relation of the blue peak gcs  in the case of unimodal metallicity distributions following an empirically motivated mass - metallicity relation ( mmr ) and the nonlinear color - metallicity relations both observed and predicted by detailed ssp modeling .",
    "we also examine the `` tilt '' of the red peak gcs in this scenario . for the sake of generality in this initial investigation",
    ", we try to keep our assumptions as simple as possible while still being realistic enough to yield useful insights .",
    "p06 presented an empirical @xmath4$]-@xmath2  relation based on their photometry and spectroscopic metallicities for a combination of 95 milky way , m49 ( ngc4472 ) , and m87 gcs ( see their fig .",
    "the milky way gc data are part of a larger project to produce a homogeneous database of integrated colors for the entire galactic gc system in the sdss photometric bandpasses ( west et  al .  2006 ; m.  west et  al .",

    "the inclusion of the virgo galaxy gc metallicities from cohen et  al .",
    "( 1998 , 2003 ) was necessary to characterize the relation at high metallicity .",
    "this adds uncertainty because the conversion from the lick indices to the zinn & west ( 1984 ) metallicity scale is not well calibrated above solar metallicity and involves some extrapolation ( see fig .",
    "14 of cohen et  al .",
    "1998 ) . however , the extrapolation is strictly linear and extends @xmath5  dex at the metal - rich end , so it could not introduce a nonlinearity in the @xmath4$]-@xmath2  relation .",
    "intrinsic trends in age and/or alpha - enhancement with metallicity could potentially introduce biases in the metallicity scale ( see the discussion in p06 ) , but such trends would not change our results if they involve a simple scaling factor .",
    "since we wish to avoid ad  hoc assumptions about model ages and abundance ratios as far as possible , we prefer to adopt empirical calibrations in our analysis , and this remains the best empirically - based color - metallicity relation available .    for simplicity , p06 used a broken linear fit to the curved @xmath4$]-@xmath2  relation , excluding the highest metallicity gcs which would have required additional curvature .",
    "to better characterize the full data set presented in p06 , we fit a quartic polynomial using robust orthogonal regression ( gaussfit ; jefferys et  al .",

    "figure  [ fig : bihistos ] presents the corresponding plots for @xmath8  based on the polynomial and spline fits to the spot model predictions .",
    "we show both sets of curves to illustrate the fact that since the color distributions depend on the derivative of the nonlinear relation between metallicity and color , the interpolation method can affect the details of the derived distributions . in practice , observational errors would obscure most of these details . for the analysis below , we concentrate on the results derived using the polynomial interpolation to be more consistent with the approach used for the empirical @xmath2relation ( for which spline interpolation is not a reasonable option ) .",
    "however , we have carried out the analysis using both methods , and the results are qualitatively the same . in this case , the uncertainties and limitations of the model predictions are greater than the differences due to the interpolation scheme .    the gcs in the simulations follow a standard gaussian gclf at any given metallicity .",

    "the third row of panels in figure  [ fig : gzslopes_giant ] is particularly interesting , as the blue - peak slopes are generally larger in absolute value than the red - peak slopes .",

    "the scatter in these slope values is typically @xmath37 , so the uncertainties on the mean slopes are about @xmath38 . if a linear transformation were used to convert the slopes from color to metallicity , the conclusion would be that the blue gcs have a stronger mmr , but this is not the case here , where there is a single mmr and no bimodality in metallicity . for comparison , analysis of a combination acs virgo and fornax cluster survey ( c^ ot ' e  et  al .",
    "2004 ; jordn  et  al .",
    "2007a ) galaxies gives mean @xmath2  blue and red peak slopes of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively , with substantial scatter among different subsamples ( mieske et  al .",

    "more specifically , where both blue and red slopes are negative , there is a tendency for the blue slope to be more negative , that is , to have a more pronounced color - magnitude relation .",
    "for example , the simulation with @xmath28\\rangle_0}},{\\ensuremath{\\langle[\\hbox{fe / h}]\\rangle_{\\rm max}}}= -0.9,-0.3 $ ] ( second row , middle panel ) has mean @xmath2  blue and red slopes of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively . we choose this as a lower metallicity comparison because it has the same factor - of - four range in the mmr limits and",

    "figure  [ fig : bislopes_giant ] presents analogous results from the same set of simulations but for the slopes of the blue and red peaks of the @xmath8  color distributions with magnitude .",
    "as described above , the transformation from metallicity to @xmath8  colors is based on the 13  gyr teramo spot models , whereas the @xmath2  colors are from the p06 empirical transformation .",

    "figure  [ fig : color_histos ] presents example @xmath2  and @xmath8  histograms for the two models we have been discussing .",
    "these histograms exemplify the range of color distributions typically found in intermediate- to high - luminosity elliptical galaxies .",
    "the distributions are clearly bimodal in all the panels of this figure . in the top panels the blue peak dominates , giving an appearance very similar to the gc color distributions found by p06 for virgo galaxies with @xmath48  mag . on the other hand ,",
    "the roughly equal peaks in the histograms of the lower panels of figure  [ fig : color_histos ] are quite similar to those found for the most massive early - type galaxies ( e.g. , p06 ; harris et  al .",
    "these are the galaxies that also show the blue tilt most strongly .",
    "it is interesting that galaxies with relatively more dominant blue peaks would have weaker blue tilts ; this would be puzzling for a trivial linear conversion between color and metallicity . however",
    ", as shown by the slope - slope comparisons in figures  [ fig : gzslopes_giant ] and  [ fig : bislopes_giant ] , the more realistic color - metallicity conversions used here reproduce this observational finding .",
    "in comparison to the color histograms , figure  [ fig : metal_histos ] shows that despite the mmr built into the models , the underlying metallicity distributions still appear unimodal .",
    "thus , the bifurcation in color results purely from the nonlinearity of the color - metallicity conversion , not the varying of gc mean metallicity with luminosity .",
    "figure  [ fig : cmds ] illustrates the @xmath49 versus @xmath2  color - magnitude diagrams for these baseline models . for clarity ,",
    "the plotted simulations contain 10,000 gcs each .",
    "the larger circles show results from kmm fits as described in sec .",
    "[ ssec : kmm ] . in order to delineate the trends more clearly",
    ", the kmm fits in figure  [ fig : cmds ] are based on 20  times the number of gcs as are plotted in the panels . as with the color histograms , these color - magnitude diagrams bear a good resemblance to those found observationally ( e.g. , p06 , mieske et  al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "observationally , the color - magnitude relation of blue - peak gcs is mainly a property of giant ellipticals , and the trend is weak or absent in lower luminosity galaxies ( e.g. degraaff et  al .  2007 ; cantiello et  al .",
    "2007 ) . however , mieske et  al .",
    "( 2006 , 2010 ) have detected it in pooled samples of gcs from faint early - type galaxies . as we have shown , the simulations with lower metallicity , which are more appropriate to low luminosity ellipticals , have less of a tendency to favor the blue tilt than do the higher metallicity simulations .",
    "however , the likely more important reason for the lack of strong blue tilts in dwarf galaxies has to do with their gclfs .",
    "not only do they have many fewer gcs , but their luminosity functions are narrower .",
    "if the gclf is too narrow , the gcs will not reach high enough luminosities to evince a significant mmr .",

    "( 2006 ) found that the width of the gclf decreases linearly with magnitude .",
    "for early - type galaxies with @xmath50 , the width @xmath51 mag ; this includes the majority of the acs virgo and fornax survey galaxies , which are actually dominated by dwarf ellipticals .",

    "the scatter in the slope values is roughly a factor of two larger for the case with @xmath52 as compared to @xmath53 , and encompasses @xmath54 at the @xmath55 level in all cases .",
    "measurements of the slopes in individual realizations are generally not significant at more than the 1@xmath56 level .",
    "thus , the lower metallicities and narrower gclf can explain why the observed gc color - magnitude trends are very weak in low luminosity galaxies .",
    "so far the discussion has centered on gc color distributions from simulations using the empirical @xmath2-metallicity relation and a theoretical @xmath8-metallicity relation from the 13  gyr spot models . as shown previously in figures  [ fig : gzhistos ] and  [ fig : bihistos ] , both of these produce clearly bimodal color distributions from single gaussians in metallicity . as another example , figure  [ fig : bi11gyrhistos ] shows predicted @xmath8  distributions similar to those in figure  [ fig : bihistos ] but now based on the 11  gyr spot models .",
    "the agreement between the distributions derived with the polynomial and spline interpolations is worse here than for the 13  gyr models , mainly because the polynomial fit is poorer .",
    "at the highest metallicities , the polynomial - derived curves in figure  [ fig : bi11gyrhistos ] appear almost trimodal , whereas the spline - derived curves appear fairly similar to those in figure  [ fig : bihistos ] , except that the blue peak is a bit broader .",
    "to examine the effects of these more irregular color distributions , figure  [ fig : bislopes_11gyr ] shows results for the slopes of the peaks in the @xmath8  color distributions analogous to figure  [ fig : bislopes_giant ] , but based on the polynomial fits to the color - metallicity relations from the 11  gyr spot models .",
    "the scatter is higher by at least @xmath2750% , and in some cases several times larger , because the distributions are less clearly bimodal , making the kmm fits much less robust . as in the case for the 13  gyr models , there is no clear preference for blue tilts in the two rows of panels in figure  [ fig : bislopes_11gyr ] with @xmath28\\rangle_{\\rm max}}}=-0.3 $ ] dex .",

    "this indicates an even stronger blue tilt than for the 13  gyr models , though again with much larger scatter .",
    "unfortunately , the behavior of the color - metallicity relation as a function of age is not well calibrated , and as we have seen , the results in this case depend on the interpolation method .",
    "of course , the @xmath2  results based on the empirical color - metallicity transformation do not explicitly assume any age for the gcs , and the simulated @xmath2  distributions are strongly bimodal with a clear tendency for the blue tilt .",
    "we further note that since the point of inflection of the nonlinear color - metallicity relation shifts with age , it is also possible to introduce a blue tilt by making the brightest gcs have systematically older ages ( s .- j .",
    "yoon , private communication ) .",
    "however , there is no a  priori reason to assume a gradient in age with luminosity , whereas the mmr that we have used in our simulations is reasonable based on gc self - enrichment .",
    "related to this , it would be very useful to have observations of gc color distributions at various lookback times to see how the color bimodality changes with time",
    ". if there is underlying bimodality in metallicity , it should change very little . on the other hand ,",
    "if it is due to the inflection in the color - metallicity relation , then the bimodality should decrease even at modest lookback times of a few gyr ( e.g. , compare figures  [ fig : bihistos ] and  [ fig : bi11gyrhistos ] ) . in practice ,",
    "the observational requirements are forbidding , since it involves measuring precise gc color distributions at @xmath59 .",
    "kalirai et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) attempted to measure evolution in the gc colors of a @xmath60 elliptical galaxy serendipitously observed in extremely deep _ hst _",
    "imaging of a foreground galactic globular cluster .",
    "these authors detected two peaks in the color distribution and interpreted them as the usual local peaks , but shifted substantially _ redder _ at @xmath60 ( even after extinction and @xmath61  corrections ) .",
    "anti_-evolution in color at a lookback time of just over 1  gyr would not be easy to understand in the context of either explanation for color bimodality .",
    "however , from fig .  2 of kalirai et  al .",
    ", it appears that the true blue and red peaks are probably where they should be , but they are unresolved because of observational error at these faint magnitudes .",
    "the apparent red peak in the color distribution is likely contamination from the coolest members of the white dwarf sequence in the foreground cluster .",
    "thus , this study illustrates the difficulty of such observations .",
    "however , it would be worth trying this experiment with the next generation of astronomical observatories , such as the _ james webb space telescope _",
    "( _ jwst _ ) and ground - based extremely large telescopes ( elts ) . in the meantime ,",
    "further refinements in the model color - metallicity predictions for different ages and elemental abundance ratios are greatly needed .",
    "the nonlinear dependence of gc optical colors on metallicity is found both empirically and from detailed ssp modeling . because the observed and predicted relations naturally produce bimodal color distributions , this nonlinearity is the simplest explanation for the observed universality of bimodal color distributions .",
    "the simplicity of this explanation is the strongest argument in its favor .",
    "in contrast , _ universal _ bimodality in the underlying gc metallicity distributions would be difficult to understand in the context of hierarchical formation models .",
    "however , this argument is purely a theoretical bias , and it is important to critically examine the available data . of course",
    ", even if the nonlinearity is the principal cause of the characteristic double - peaked gc color histograms , this would not preclude a predominance of two distinct metallicity components in _ some _ galaxies .    for the models explored in the present work",
    ", there is no bimodality in metallicity , just a subtle increase in the mean gc metallicity with mass , as may be expected from self - enrichment models .",
    "we have done this precisely to test whether or not the ` blue tilt' can occur within unimodal metallicity distributions .",
    "as we have shown , the resulting color distributions and color - magnitude relations are similar to those found in real galaxies .",
    "the correlation between luminosities and metallicities in these models is dominated by scatter , as shown in figure  [ fig : mz_feh ] , which plots the @xmath49-band magnitude - metallicity relation that would be observed for our favored giant elliptical model .",
    "the plotted `` observed metallicities '' in the right panel of figure  [ fig : mz_feh ] are found by using the colors that include simulated observational error and then inverting the color - metallicity relation .",
    "the resemblance of this figure to the corresponding one observed by mieske et  al .",
    "( 2006 , see their fig .",
    "12 ) is striking .    very little",
    "is actually known about the detailed metallicity distributions of gcs in giant ellipticals . in support of their hypothesis , yoon et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) showed that the histogram of mg@xmath62 values for 150 gcs in m87 from cohen et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) is reasonably consistent with a gaussian metallicity distribution and the conversions predicted by their ssp models ; however , this represents only @xmath63 of the gcs and may not be representative of the full population .",
    "in contrast , strader et  al.(2007 ) found that metallicities derived from the lick index measurements for 47 gcs in m49 ( cohen et  al .",
    "2003 ) do appear bimodal , in the sense that a double gaussian provided a significantly better fit to their derived metallicities than a single gaussian . a skewed distribution , such as found for halo stars in other galaxies ( e.g. , harris & harris 2002 ; harris et  al .  2007 ) and derived by yoon et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) from multi - band optical photometry of extragalactic gc systems , would also favor two - gaussian models , even if the enrichment process was continuous .",
    "perhaps more importantly , this 47-object spectroscopic sample represents only @xmath64 of m49 s total population .",
    "it may be that such a small sample of bright gcs observed in two spectroscopic masks in two regions of m49 shows metallicity bimodality , but that the full population would have a more continuous distribution from the blending of numerous substructures and metallicity components as expected from hierarchical accretion .",
    "we note that the metallicities as published by cohen et  al .  for",
    "the same sample of gcs do not strongly favor bimodality ( kmm @xmath65-value @xmath66 ) , even though they come from the same data and correlate well with those of strader et  al .",
    "this is because subtle changes in a few metallicities can have large effects on the interpretation when the sample size is small . in another study ,",
    "puzia et  al .",
    "( 2005 ) presented spectroscopic metallicities , ages , and @xmath67 $ ] ratios for 71 gcs in seven early - type galaxies , finding evidence for trends of decreasing gc age and @xmath67 $ ] with increasing metallicity .",
    "the metallicity histogram for this sample appeared unimodal , but with broad tails ( see fig .  7 of puzia et  al .  2005 ) . in short ,",
    "published spectroscopic data sets are inadequate for detailed constraints on the gc metallicity distributions in the general population of early - type galaxies .",
    "the prospects for obtaining large samples are of course more favorable with multi - band imaging , and the combination of high - quality near - ir and optical photometry can provide useful constraints on metallicity ( see cb07 ) .",
    "for instance , by combining optical and irac 3.6@xmath68m - band photometry for 146  gcs in the peculiar , post - merger elliptical ngc5128 ( cen  a ) , spitler et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) found evidence for bimodality in metallicity .",
    "a similar data set for 75 gcs in the sombrero galaxy was inadequate to draw any conclusions in this regard .",
    "several other important , ground - breaking studies of the optical - ir colors of gcs in giant ellipticals have been carried out ( e.g. , kissler - patig et  al .  2002 ;",
    "puzia et  al .  2002 ; hempel et  al .",
    "the color distributions generally appear broad , often with non - gaussian tails , but the samples are still relatively small and do not show the same obvious bimodality as found in the large samples of purely optical gc colors . a claimed exception to this",
    "was based on matched wfpc2 @xmath69 and nicmos @xmath70 photometry of a pruned subsample of 80 gcs in m87 ( kundu & zepf 2007 ) . the positions and photometry for these objects were never published , but the histogram showed a gap at intermediate color .",
    "however , the red `` peak '' comprised an excess of only 4  gcs with respect to this gap , and a double gaussian was preferred over a single gaussian at only the 2.4-@xmath71 level .",
    "most importantly , the whole sample constituted only 0.5% of the full population of m87 gcs .",
    "representative samples of optical - ir gc colors in a statistical number of elliptical galaxies are needed for general constraints on their metallicity distributions .",
    "in addition , the establishment of empirical conversions from these colors to metallicity , and detailed comparison to model predictions as a function of age , will be essential .",
    "several groups are actively working on this topic , so the data required for these efforts should be available in the near future .",
    "the combination of a realistic , nonlinear color - metallicity dependence with a simple mass - metallicity scaling relation motivated by self - enrichment considerations can produce gc populations with bimodal color distributions _ and _ an apparent color - magnitude relation ( `` blue tilt '' ) for the gcs within the blue peak of the color distribution .",
    "the underlying metallicity distributions are unimodal . for certain metallicity ranges ,",
    "the color - magnitude relation for gcs within the red peak is weak or absent , consistent with observations for most giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "the models which reproduce these features have nearly equal red and blue peaks , again consistent with the data for giant ellipticals . as noted by yoon et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , this equality occurs because the inflection point in the color - magnitude relation is approximately equal to the peak metallicity of the gc system .",
    "it is when the peak metallicity begins to move through the inflection point that the `` blue tilt '' becomes most pronounced . as a result",
    ", the significance of the tilt tends to increase in higher metallicity populations with redder mean colors ; thus , it would be greater in more massive galaxies and at smaller galactocentric radii , both of which are found observationally ( mieske et  al .",
    "2006 , 2010 ) .    at the low - metallicity extreme of our simulations",
    ", there is actually a preference for red tilts over blue ones because the peak of the metallicity distribution is well below the inflection point of the color - metallicity relation .",
    "but in practice , the galaxies that would harbor such metal - poor systems would have low luminosities , few gcs , and far too few red gcs to show a significant tilt .",
    "the narrower gclfs typical of low - luminosity galaxies also greatly reduce the significance of any color - magnitude trends in our simulations because of the reduced range in gc luminosity .",
    "further , because we have assumed a single mass - metallicity relation for all gcs , this scenario implies that the redder , more metal - rich gc systems of giant galaxies will have a higher mean mass than those of dwarf ellipticals , again consistent with observations ( jordn  et  al .",
    "2007b ) .    a few giant galaxies with weak or absent blue tilts such as m49 ( mieske et  al .",
    "2006 ; strader et  al .",
    "2006 ; but see also lee et  al .",
    "2008 ) can be understood as simply being consistent with stochastic variations among different model realizations .",
    "this is because the actual underlying metallicity distribution is broad .",
    "if the colors linearly reflected metallicity , so that the blue peak of the gc color distribution truly represented a distinct subpopulation `` squeezed '' into a narrow metallicity margin that tightly became more metal - rich with luminosity , then stochastic variations in such a homogenous population would be small .",
    "thus , a large galaxy without a blue tilt would be truly anomalous . however , even in our favored high - metallicity model that accurately reproduces the observed mean @xmath2  blue and red tilts , at least 15% of the simulations lack significant color - magnitude slopes in the blue peak",
    "thus , it is not surprising to find a galaxy like m49 , and this scenario predicts that others will be found once large samples of giant ellipticals with similarly well - measured color - magnitude diagrams are available .",
    "further observations are needed to test this scenario more quantitatively .",
    "in particular , we still do not know in detail the underlying form of the metallicity distributions of gcs in giant ellipticals , and we have assumed gaussians only for the sake of simplicity , whereas the true distributions may be skewed in a manner similar to that of old halo stars ( yoon et  al .",
    "accurate characterization of these distributions will require still larger spectroscopic samples and improved models for converting measured indices to actual metallicities .",
    "as we have noted , large samples of optical - ir colors in multiple elliptical galaxies , and empirical conversions from these colors to metallicity , are also needed .",
    "the required data should be available soon from ongoing observational efforts .",
    "we have found that the precise shapes of gc color distributions can depend on the fine details of the color - metallicity conversion .",
    "in addition to more extensive data samples , improving the accuracy of photometrically estimated gc metallicities will require a broader and more densely calculated set of models , all with better calibrations against resolved stellar populations .",
    "the variation of alpha - element enhancement as a function of metallicity needs to be calibrated and taken into account for accurate data - model comparisons .",
    "further refinement in our understanding of changes in the color - metallicity relation with age , particularly with regards to the behavior of the horizontal branch , is essential .",
    "it is also important to obtain useful empirical constraints on trends in gc age with metallicity , although there will likely be large variations in any such trends due to the merging histories of individual galaxies .",
    "a still more challenging task is to measure the change in color distributions with age by obtaining high quality photometry of gc populations at significant cosmological lookback times .",
    "finally , we note that this investigation has explored the behavior of the blue tilt phenomenon under variations of only two parameters , here labeled @xmath21\\rangle_0 $ ]  and @xmath21\\rangle_{\\rm max}$ ] .",
    "although we consider the results presented here promising , more sophisticated models are of course desirable , especially once more precise color - metallicity transformations become available .",
    "given the remaining uncertainties and the importance of gc metallicity distributions to understanding detailed galaxy formation histories , we hope that this will continue to be an active area of theoretical and observational research into the coming era of _ jwst _ and the planned elts .",
