    "there are various models of collective opinion formation in which agents modify their opinions according to interaction with other agents @xcite . opinion formation is a dynamic process : for example , interaction between agents makes their opinions approach each other .",
    "an important problem in opinion dynamics is to examine when an agreement ( i.e. , consensus ) among all the agents occurs .",
    "complete agreement is rarely observed in the real world @xcite .",
    "however , it is an established fact that opinion dynamics under the voter model , a classical opinion model in statistical physics and probability theory , inevitably reaches agreement in finite populations @xcite .",
    "the majority rule model has a similar feature @xcite .",
    "partly motivated by this discrepancy , various extensions of voter and majority rule models and different models of collective opinion formation have been proposed to account for the disagreement in finite populations .",
    "examples include the deffuant model @xcite , language competition models @xcite , voter - like models on adaptive networks @xcite , voter model under partisan bias ( the assumption that agents naturally prefer one opinion ) @xcite , and variations of axelrod s cultural dynamics ( see @xcite for references ) .",
    "theoretical models have also been proposed in social sciences to explain disagreement in the context of polarization .",
    "for example , prior beliefs or initially received signals can cause disagreement between agents , even if they receive the same public signals from then on @xcite .",
    "although there is a plethora of studies addressing the problem of agreement and disagreement in opinion dynamics , we propose a model incorporating two factors that are relevant to human behavior : bayesian belief updating and confirmation bias .",
    "bayesian belief updating is commonly used in studies of the decision making of agents receiving uncertain information @xcite .",
    "the confirmation bias is a psychological bias inherent in humans , in which an agent inclined towards an opinion tends to misperceive incoming signals as supporting the agent s belief @xcite . a non - bayesian model with the confirmation bias",
    "was previously proposed for explaining the influences of media and interactions between agents @xcite .",
    "we are not the first to study opinion formation under the bayesian updating and confirmation bias . in the framework of single agent opinion formation",
    ", rabin and schrag showed that the confirmation bias triggers overconfidence and can cause the individual to hold incorrect beliefs , even if it receives a series of external signals suggesting the true state of the world @xcite .",
    "orlan studied the bayesian dynamics of agents subjected to the confirmation bias , interacting through the mean field @xcite . the model yields agreement or disagreement depending on the parameter values .    in this study , motivated by the rabin - schrag model @xcite",
    ", we propose a model of collective opinion formation with a confirmation bias .",
    "we model direct peer - to - peer interactions between agents ( not through the mean field ) and their effects on the bayesian updating of each agent . to study the pure effects of interactions among agents",
    ", we do not assume that agents receive signals from the environment as in previous studies @xcite .",
    "we numerically simulate the model to reveal the conditions under which the populations of agents agree and disagree , depending on the values of parameters such as the strength of the confirmation bias , fidelity of the signal , and the system size .",
    "our model modifies the bayesian decision - making model proposed by rabin and schrag @xcite in two main ways .",
    "first , we consider a well - mixed population of bayesian agents that interact with each other ; rabin and schrag focused on the case of the single agent .",

    "we label the @xmath0 agents @xmath1 and denote the opinion of agent @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) by @xmath4 , where a and b are the alternative opinions .",

    "the agent forms a belief by repetitively receiving a stochastic signal @xmath34 from nature , according to @xmath148 .",

    "this probability is equal to zero when @xmath149 and positive when @xmath150 ( see proposition @xmath127 in @xcite ) .",
    "our results obtained in this section are consistent with theirs because disagreement in our model roughly corresponds to misunderstanding in the rabin - schrag model .      in general , there are @xmath151 disagreement configurations , as distinguished by the number of agents that finally believe in opinion a , which ranges from @xmath69 to @xmath151 . to distinguish different disagreement configurations , we examined the fraction of agents that believed in the minority opinion at the end of a run .",
    "we averaged this fraction over the runs ending with disagreement .",

    "when @xmath42 is small , the average size of the minority monotonically decreases with @xmath42 and monotonically increases with @xmath33 for both @xmath152 and @xmath90 .",
    "therefore , small @xmath42 and large @xmath33 values allow only balanced disagreement configurations , in which the numbers of the agents believing in the opposite opinions are close to @xmath153 .    however , the average size of the minority increases when @xmath42 is large .",
    "this is particularly the case for @xmath76 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : r_minority_minoritymin](b ) ] .",
    "this increase occurs for the following reason . with a strong confirmation bias",
    ", agents end up with an opinion consistent with a small number of signals perceived in the early stages , and both signals are equally likely to be observed in the early stages under neutral initial conditions . in the extreme case in which @xmath47 , agents reinforce the opinion that is consistent with their first perceived signal .",
    "therefore , unbalanced disagreement configurations are rarely realized when @xmath42 is large .",
    "figures [ fig : r_bm ] and [ fig : r_minority_minoritymin ] suggest that the agreement is unlikely to be reached in a large population .",

    "this result is intuitive : the bimodal initial condition paves the way to disagreement .",
    "in contrast , @xmath154 under the most unbalanced initial condition is almost constant near @xmath166 irrespective of @xmath0 .",

    "the results shown in fig . [",
    "fig : qcr_vs_n ] suggest that the eventual behavior of the model strongly depends on the initial condition even after the results are averaged over runs .",
    "our numerical results are summarized as follows . when the confirmation bias is absent ( i.e. , @xmath45 ) , the opinion dynamics under the bayesian update rule leads to the complete agreement among agents .",
    "the behavior of the model is similar to majority rule dynamics ( fig .",
    "[ fig : meanp_ba ] ) . when the confirmation bias is present , disagreement is a likely outcome , particularly for a strong confirmation bias ( i.e. , large @xmath42 ) .",
    "disagreement is also more likely for a lower fidelity of the signal ( i.e. , @xmath167 ) and a larger system size .",

    "this line is identical to the one determined by rabin and schrag for their model for a single agent s decision making @xcite . finally , the behavior of the model strongly depends on the initial condition .",
    "our model and results are different from orlan s @xcite , although orlan s model employs multiple agents that perform the bayesian updates under a confirmation bias .",
    "first , the belief of each agent is binary in orlan s model , whereas our model introduces an infinite range of discrete beliefs , as in @xcite .",
    "second , interaction between agents is introduced differently in the two models . in orlan s model",
    ", each agent refers to the global fraction of agents believing in one of the two opinions . in our model",
    ", agents refer to other opinions by peer - to - peer interaction , i.e. , by receiving a binary signal that is correlated with the belief of the sender .",
    "third , the stochastic dynamics of orlan s model is ergotic when the collective opinion does not reach agreement .",
    "the collective opinion obeys a stationary distribution , irrespective of the initial condition .",
    "in contrast , in all our simulations , the stochastic dynamics of our model was nonergotic , such that the final configuration depended on the initial condition in a wide parameter region .",
    "in social science studies of polarization , several authors analyzed bayesian models in which different agents receiving a series of common signals end up in disagreement .",
    "the proposed mechanisms governing disagreement include different initial beliefs or factors that affect perception of later incoming signals @xcite , different update rules @xcite , and ambiguity aversion @xcite .",
    "these models and ours are different in three major ways .",
    "first , a ground truth opinion corresponding to the state of nature is assumed in these models but not in ours .",
    "second , public signals commonly received by different agents are assumed in these models but not in ours .",

    ". models with interacting bayesian agents , which show disagreement ( reviewed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , are also different from our model in the first respect .",
    "it should be noted that zimper and ludwig discussed confirmation bias with their bayesian model @xcite .",
    "however , they derived a confirmation bias from their model , rather than assuming one , such that their results pertaining to confirmation bias were also distinct from ours .    extending our model to the case of networks",
    "is straightforward .",
    "for example , we can select a recipient of the signal with probability @xmath13 and then select the sender with equal probability among the neighbors of the recipient on the network .",
    "another possible update rule is to select the sender first and then the recipient among the sender s neighbors .",
    "yet another possibility is to select a link with equal probability and designate one of the two agents as sender and the other as recipient . on heterogeneous networks ,",
    "the results may depend on the update rule because it is the case in the voter model @xcite .",
    "extension of the model to the case of confirmation bias heterogeneity may also be interesting .",
    "neurological evidence shows that different individuals have different confirmation bias strengths @xcite .",
    "the strength of the confirmation bias and the position of the node in a social network may be correlated and affect the dynamics .",
    "it is also straightforward to extend the model to the case of multiple opinion cases .",
