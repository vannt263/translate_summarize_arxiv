    "the standard model for fanaroff - riley type ii radio sources is described as a pair of relativistic jets of electrons which is ejected in opposite directions from a very compact region in the nucleus of an elliptical galaxy @xcite .",
    "the jets expand adiabatically through the interstellar medium of the host galaxy and the surrounding intergalactic medium .",
    "collimation of the jets is provided by the presence of a cavity or `` cocoon '' surrounding the jet , which maintains the pressure of the intergalactic medium in balance with that of the relativistic gas within the jet . in this model ,",
    "the jets maintain a straight trajectory .",
    "however , observations have shown that jets often bent .",
    "typical examples of bending in radio sources appear in _ radio trail _ sources , _ mirror symmetric _ sources and radio galaxies which present _ inversion symmetry _ @xcite .",
    "another way of inducing deflections in radio jets is if the beam passes through a region of interstellar or intergalactic gas in which there is a significant pressure gradient .",
    "this can occur if the jets pass through the interstellar medium of a large galaxy or diffuse intergalactic cloud .",
    "observations of this might be present in the radio galaxy 3c31 @xcite , but the quasar pks 1318 + 113 @xcite is an extremely good evidence of a deflection induced by a jet  cloud interaction .",
    "the interaction of an astrophysical jet with a cloud , in which the characteristic size of the cloud is much greater than the jet radius , has been studied in its initial stages by raga & cant ( 1995 ) .",
    "their results show that initially the jet slowly begins to bore a passage into the cloud .",
    "eventually a stationary situation is achieved in which the jet penetrates the cloud and escapes from it in a direction which is different from the original jet trajectory .",
    "once the steady state in this interaction is reached , the trajectory is determined by maintaining pressure equilibrium with the surrounding environment .",
    "since the expansion of the jet is adiabatic and a steady state has been reached , bernoulli s equation in its relativistic and non  relativistic form @xcite can be used to describe the path of the jet @xcite .    with all these considerations , once the distribution of the gas inside the cloud is known , it is possible to integrate bernoulli s equation numerically with the use of a runge  kutta method .",
    "analitic solutions are possible for the case in which the jet penetrates the cloud at a position @xmath0 with a high supersonic motion @xcite .",
    "let us first discuss the case in which the cloud is an isothermal sphere for which it s density , and hence its pressure , is inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector . under these circumstances ,",
    "the problem is characterised by the gravitational constant @xmath1 , a `` '' @xmath2 and the values of the velocity of the jet and the density at this point which are @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "three independent dimensions ( length , time and mass ) describe the whole hydrodynamical problem . since four independent physical quantities ( @xmath5 ) are fundamental for the problem we are interested , the @xcite of dimensional analysis demands the existence of only one dimensionless parameter @xmath6 .",
    "this parameter is obtained naturally from the full analytic solution @xcite .",
    "the other obvious dimensionless number that parametrises the solutions is the mach number @xmath7 evaluated at position @xmath2 .",
    "the deflection of non  relativitic jets in isothermal clouds might be important for interstellar molecular clouds and the jets associated with herbig  haro objects . if we adopt a particle number density of @xmath8 , and a temperature @xmath9 for a cloud with radius @xmath10 @xcite , then @xmath11 .",
    "the same calculation can be made for the cases of radio jets interacting with the gas inside a cluster of galaxies .",
    "for this case , typical values are @xmath12 ( @xcite ) . with these values , the parameter @xmath13 , which is the same value as the one obtained for herbig ",
    "haro objects .",
    "the fact that jets are formed in various environments such as giant molecular clouds and the gaseous haloes of clusters of galaxies with the same values of the dimensionless parameter @xmath14 provides a clue as to why the jets look the same in such widely different environments .    from its definition",
    ", the parameter @xmath14 can be rewritten as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the mass within a sphere of radius @xmath17 .",
    "this quantity is roughly the ratio of the gravitational potential energy from the cloud acting on a fluid element of the jet , to its kinetic energy at the initial position @xmath2 .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 is thus an indicator of how large the deflections due to gravity are going to affect the trajectory of the jet .",
    "the bigger the number @xmath18 , the more important the deflection caused by gravity will be . in other words ,",
    "when the parameter @xmath19 the jet becomes ballistic and bends towards the centre of the cloud .",
    "when @xmath20 the deflections are dominated by the pressure gradients in the cloud and the jets bend away from the centre of the cloud .",
    "let us consider next the case of a galaxy dominated by a dark matter halo for which the mass density is given by the relation @xcite : @xmath21 , in which @xmath22 is the core radius and quantities with a star refer to the value at the centre of the galaxy .",
    "the gas in the galaxy is in hydrostatic equilibrium with the dark matter halo , so that @xmath23 . in exactly the same form",
    "as it was done above , the important parameters in the problem are the gravitational constant @xmath24 , the characteristic length @xmath22 and the sound speed @xmath25 , together with the gas density @xmath26 evaluated at the centre of the cloud .",
    "since three independent dimensions ( length , time and mass ) describe the whole hydrodynamical problem , dimensional analysis demands the existence of only one dimensionless parameter @xmath27 .",
    "the unimportant proportionality factor of @xmath28 is introduced here since it appears naturally in the analytic solution @xcite .",
    "the mach number @xmath29 , evaluated at the point where the jet enters the cloud is another dimensionless number which parametrises the solution of this problem . using typical values @xcite for galaxies then @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "taking central values for the gas in the galaxy as @xmath32 and @xmath33 then @xmath34 .",
    "the number @xmath35 can be rewritten as @xmath36 , where @xmath16 is the mass of a sphere with radius @xmath37 .",
    "this quantity is proportional to the gravitational energy of the cloud evaluated at the core radius divided by the sonic kinetic energy that a fluid element in the jet has . in other words , in the same way as it was done above , the dimensionless number @xmath35 is an indicator as to how big deflections produced by gravity are .",
    "consider now the case in which relativistic effects are included in the interaction of a relativistic jet and a stratified high density region . to simplify the problem , the self gravity of the cloud acting on the jet",
    "is ignored .",
    "bernoulli s equation in its non ",
    "relativistic form can be integrated numerically under this considerations and it is possible to find out analytic solutions when the mach number of the flow inside the jet is much greater than unity .",
    "this was done for the case in which the cloud is an isothermal sphere and for the case in which the interaction is between the jet and gas in pressure equilibrium with a dark matter halo @xcite .",
    "when a jet bends it is in direct contact with its surroundings and entrainment from the external gas might cause disruption to its structure @xcite . however , if this situation is bypassed for example by an efficient cooling , then there remains a high mach number collimated flow inside a curved jet .",
    "when supersonic flow bends , the characteristics emanating from it intersect at a certain point in space @xcite .",
    "since the hydrodynamical values of the flow in a characteristic line have constant values , the intersection causes the different values of these quantities to be multivalued . this situation can not occur in nature and a shock wave",
    "is formed .",
    "the formation of internal shocks inside the jet gives rise to subsonic flow inside it and collimation may no longer be achieved .",
    "if the characteristic lines produced by the flow inside the jet intersect outside it , then a shock wave is not formed and the jet remains collimated as it bends .",
    "however , two important points have to be considered in the discussion .",
    "the first is that the mach number decreases in a bend as the flow moves .",
    "the second is that the rate of change of the mach angle with respect to the angle the jet makes with its original straight trajectory ( the bending angle ) increases without bound as the velocity of the flow tends to that of the local velocity of sound .",
    "this was first proved by icke ( 1991 ) for the case in which no relativistic effects were taken into account .",
    "we have made a relativistic generalisation to these two points @xcite .",
    "the fact that two shocks might form inside a jet , one of them at the end of the bending when the mach number is near one , enables us to find an upper limit to the bending angle @xcite .",
    "for example , a non ",
    "relativitic jet with a polytropic index @xmath38 can not be deflected more than @xmath39 . under the same non ",
    "relativitic conditions , but by assuming a polytropic index @xmath40 , non  relativitic jets with a relativistic equation of state can not be deflected more than @xmath41 @xcite .    when a full relativistic analysis is introduced in this description , this upper limit can not be greater than its non ",
    "relativitic counterpart .",
    "this is because characteristic lines emanating from a relativistic flow are closer to the streamlines as compared to their non ",
    "relativitic counterparts @xcite . as a result",
    ", a relativistic jet with a polytropic index @xmath42 can not bend more than @xmath43 .",
    "the precise conditions under which an internal shock is produced for a given jet depend on the shape of the curve that the jet makes as it bends and the radius of the jet .",
    "the most important consequence of the calculations described above is the sensitivity of the deflection angles to variations in velocity .",
    "this sensitivity is due to the fact that the force applied to a given fluid element in the jet ( due to pressure and gravitational potential gradients ) is the same independent of the velocity of the flow in the jet .",
    "however , as the velocity of the flow in the jet increases , there is not enough time for this force to change the curvature of the jet soon enough , giving rise to very straight jets ."
