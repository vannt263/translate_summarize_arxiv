    "let us first look at a simpler example . in @xcite , the operator @xmath287 is considered . under dirichlet",

    "+ this is in fact a variation of the original techniques introduced by riemann in order to obtain the functional equation and analytic continuation of his zeta function ( see chapter 2 of @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "+ the question is now whether a similar argument can be reproduced for the non - holomorphic eisenstein series for which we know there exists a functional equation .",

    "we have shown in this paper that the method of contour integration applied to the eigenvalues of the laplacian in the torus yields an alternative expression of the chowla - selberg series formula which is very useful to immediately and effortlessly obtain the functional determinant of the laplacian operator as opposed to having to use sophisticated results such as the kronecker first limit formula .",
    "in fact , once the equivalence with the chowla - selberg formula is established , the proof of the kronecker limit formula follows . moreover , as special cases of the comparison we obtain other interesting formulae , some of which are new and some already well - known , involving the dedekind eta function as well as the divisor function .",
