    "the classical electrical impedance tomography ( eit ) problem seeks to obtain quantitative information on the electrical conductivity @xmath9 of a body from multiple measurements of voltages and corresponding currents at its surface .",
    "the extensive study of this problem has led to major mathematical advances on uniqueness and reconstruction methods for inverse problems with boundary data .",
    "see the excellent reviews @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "however , by now it is well understood that the problem is exponentially ill - posed , yielding images of low resolution away from the boundary @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a new class of inverse problems seeks to significantly improve both the quantitative accuracy and the resolution of traditional inverse boundary value problems by using data which can be determined in the interior of the object .",
    "these have been dubbed hybrid methods , as they usually involve the combination of two different kinds of physical measurements , and several recent advances are presented in the present issue of the journal .    in this paper",
    "we continue our study of the current density impedance imaging ( cdii ) problem of reconstructing the conductivity of a body based on measurement of currents in its interior .",
    "such measurements have been possible since the early 1990 due to the pioneering work of m. joy s group at the university of toronto @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the idea was to use magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) in a novel way , to determine the magnetic flux density @xmath10 induced by an applied current .",
    "it is important to note that in the problem addressed in this paper , we only require knowledge of the magnitude @xmath1 of one current generated by a given voltage @xmath2 on the boundary @xmath3 . the analytic and numerical methods presented here do not necessarily depend on mri .",
    "since the results only require knowledge of the magnitude of one current , they may lead to simpler physical methodologies to obtain such data ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the problem of recovering the isotropic conductivity @xmath9 of an object from knowledge of the magnitude of one current density @xmath1 in the interior was studied in @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a review , and for numerous references to other hybrid approaches to conductivity imaging . in this paper",
    "we present an alternating split bregman algorithm for the numerical solution of this problem , along with a convergence proof .",
    "let @xmath9 be the the isotropic conductivity of an object @xmath11 , @xmath12 and let @xmath8 be the current density vector field generated by imposing a given boundary voltage @xmath2 .",
    "then the corresponding voltage potential @xmath13 satisfies the elliptic equation @xmath14 by ohm s law @xmath15 .",
    "hence the voltage potential @xmath13 satisfies the degenerate elliptic equation @xmath16 in general there is no uniqueness for viscosity solutions @xcite of the above equation @xcite .",
    "however , in @xcite and @xcite authors proved that if the potential @xmath13 satisfies eqauation ( 1 ) above then it minimizes the energy functional @xmath17 associated to the equation ( [ deg ] ) and , moreover that this functional has a unique minimizer in @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the conductivity is uniquely determined by the magnitude of the current generated by imposing a given boundary voltage and the corresponding voltage potential is the unique solution of the ( infinite - dimensional ) minimization problem @xmath19 a simple iterative procedure to solve ( [ min_prob ] ) was given in @xcite .",
    "this method was only defined when dirichlet problems such as ( 1 ) for successive approximations of @xmath9 were guaranteed to produce solutions with non - vanishing gradients in @xmath0 . for planar regions ,",
    "this led to the requirement that the given boundary voltage be almost two - to - one .",
