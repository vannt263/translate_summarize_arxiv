    "( _ ghz _ ) argument @xcite was devised more than twenty years ago to prove bell s theorem ( nonlocality of qm ) without introducing inequalities .",
    "it is based on a gedankenexperiment which can be transformed into a real experiment ( _ ghz experiment _ ) @xcite .",
    "some years ago szab and fine proved that a _ local _ hidden variables theory can be supplied for the ghz experiment based on the assumption that `` the detection efficiency is not ( only ) the effect of random errors in the detection equipment , but it is a more fundamental phenomenon , the manifestation of a predetermined hidden property of the particles '' @xcite . their proof is actually based also on the further assumption that the probability measure @xmath0 to be defined on the space @xmath1 of the hidden variables of their theory must satisfy some constraints following from qm , which is equivalent to modifying the standard interpretation of quantum probabilities considering them as conditional on detection rather than absolute in the specific case of the ghz experiment .",
    "it is important to observe that , because of the above assumptions , the szab and fine proof does not show that the ghz argument is wrong .",
    "rather , it shows that the ghz argument depends on adopting the standard interpretation of quantum probabilities as absolute ( in particular , when assuming perfect correlation , i.e. , correlations with probability 1 ) , while it fails to be true when this interpretation is modified in the sense proposed by szab and fine .",
    "szab and fine , however did not provide a general theory of quantum phenomena which avoids nonlocality .",
    "a theory of this kind was instead recently supplied by some of us and called _ extended semantic realism _",
    "( _ esr _ ) _ model _ @xcite .",
    "the esr model consists of a microscopic and a macroscopic part .",
    "the former can be considered as a hidden variables theory , which justifies and supports the assumptions stated in the latter providing a set  theoretical description of the microscopic world .",
    "the latter constitutes the part of the theory that is interpreted on the physical domain , and introduces a general mathematical apparatus which embodies the standard mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics ( qm ) , but reinterprets quantum probabilities as conditional on detection rather than absolute , thus circumventing known `` no  go '' theorems @xcite .",
    "if one then compares the esr model with the szab and fine theory for the ghz experiment , one immediately realizes that there is a correspondence between the assumptions of the two approaches .",
    "indeed , the esr model introduces in every measurement a _ detection probability _ , which depends on the values that the hidden variables ( _ microscopic states _ ) take on the individual example ( _ physical object _ ) of the physical system that is considered and not on flaws or lack of efficiency of the measuring apparatuses ( hence the basic theoretical entities of the esr model are _ generalized observables _ obtained by adding a _ no  registration outcome _ , which provides nontrivial information on the physical object that is measured , to the set of possible values of each standard observable of qm ) .",
    "this assumption restates and generalizes the first assumption of szab and fine mentioned above , which follows an idea by fine @xcite , going back , according to fine himself , to einstein @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have seen that quantum probabilities are reinterpreted as conditional on detection in the esr model , which restates and generalizes the second assumption of szab and fine mentioned above .",
    "based on the above remarks , we intend to show in this paper that several local finite models for the ghz experiment can be extracted from the esr model and immediately converted into the `` toy '' models supplied by szab and fine for the same experiment , thus proving the consistency of our general proposal with some previous significant but very specific results in the literature .",
