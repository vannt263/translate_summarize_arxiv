    "the self - gravity of a massive protoplanetary disc may , under certain conditions @xcite , cause small perturbations within the disc to grow in amplitude ( i.e. , a gravitational instability ; gi ) until the instabilities saturate in the nonlinear regime .",
    "gis can manifest themselves as spiral arms and shocks , heat the disc , and drive angular momentum and mass transport ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) , as well as create molecular abundance variations that could be used as observational telltales of active gis ( ilee et al .",

    "removal of gas by tides @xcite or the accretion of gas @xcite and planetesimals @xcite , plus nonlinear planet - disc coupling through radiative heat exchange @xcite together make it extremely difficult to say what becomes of the remaining object .",
    "the list of possibilities goes from rocky and giant planets to brown dwarfs and even low mass stars @xcite .",
    "rapid inward migration of first fragments @xcite is a particular concern for the survivability of giant planets formed by gis .",
    "initial fragment sizes are comparable to the corresponding hill sphere of the clumps themselves , to within a factor of two or three ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to survive the rapid radial migration , the clumps need to cool and contract rapidly , so that central temperatures reach @xmath4 k ( e.g. , *",
    "* ) _ before _ tidal forces from the star disrupt the planet . at @xmath5",

    "the resulting dynamical collapse of the protoplanet from sizes of @xmath6 r@xmath7 to a few to tens of r@xmath7 @xcite is analogous to the end of the first core stage in star formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and may allow the protoplanet to avoid tidal destruction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper",
    "we describe a second , so far insufficiently explored , channel for the collapse of giant planets faced with rapid inward migration .",
    "this second channel exists entirely due to the heavy element component within the fragments . as is well known ,",
    "rapid grain growth can promote sedimentation of large grains to the centre of the clump @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show that _ if _ the segregation of heavy elements to the central regions of the fragment is efficient , then dynamical collapse of the clump may be initiated by a dynamical instability in the clump s centre , next to the core , _ before the mean temperature of the fragment rises to _",
    "this instability is quite analogous to that laying the foundation of the core accretion plus gas capture theory of giant planet formation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which we refer to as simply core accretion ( ca ) hereafter . in ca , the core grows by accretion of planetesimals from the disc and gravitationally attracts a gaseous `` atmosphere '' , again from the disc . the atmosphere s mass increases as a steep power of core mass @xcite .",
    "when the two masses become comparable , there is no stable hydrostatic solution and the atmosphere collapses onto the core dynamically @xcite , triggering a rapid gas accretion from the disc onto the protoplanet ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent detailed treatment of the problem ) .",
    "we find a very similar sequence of events , except that the core grows by accretion of small grains rather than planetesimals , and all the action occurs inside a self - gravitating gas fragment born from gis .",
    "understanding the core accretion - like instability discovered here is a key to understanding the pre - collapse evolution of the disc instability planets , and is necessary for identifying ways to distinguish observationally between planet formation modes . to differentiate between the instability discussed here and the one in the ca hypothesis",
    ", we call the collapse studied in this work a `` core - assisted gas capture '' ( cagc ) instability , with emphasis that the core is embedded deep within a massive self - gravitating gaseous clump",
    ".    global disc fragmentation simulations are not yet advanced enough to follow both the formation of a clump and the clump s subsequent evolution to planetary scales .",
    "in particular , the region near the growing core is numerically challenging to investigate due to the required resolution and the extreme changes in gas composition .",
    "for example , a core will have a radius of @xmath9  au , which is about 10,000 times smaller than the size scale of a molecular hydrogen gaseous clump .",
    "although this core may be small compared with the total extent of the clump , we shall later see that destabilisation of gas directly surrounding the core can lead to collapse of the entire system .    here , as a first step",
    ", we present a series of simple 1d models that focus on the structure of the gas atmospheres near cores that have a range of core properties ( masses and luminosities ) .",
    "our primary purpose is to address the following : ( a ) the conditions necessary for a core within a self - gravitating fragment to prompt dynamical collapse of the core s atmosphere ; ( b ) the critical core s mass at which this collapse happens , and ( c ) the likelihood of these conditions to be met by fragments born from gis within a reasonable protoplanetary disc setting .",
    "we present our numerical methods in section 2 , and show the results of a case study for a particular clump mass in section 3 .",
    "we then explore in section 4 the parameter space for which cores can drive the collapse of their atmospheres .",
    "our results are summarised and their implications are discussed in section 5 .",
    "the basic physics of core - assisted gas capture instability is very similar to that of the core accretion instability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "consider a very dense core ( solid or liquid ) immersed in an initially uniform gas of a given ( lower ) density and temperature .",
    "gravitational attraction of the core will pull gas layers closest to the core even closer , compressing the material , until a hydrostatic balance is established . at the same time",
    ", compression heats the material up , and since this all occurs on the ( very short ) local dynamical time scale , the compressed layer initially has an adiabatic structure .",
    "@xcite questioned hydrodynamical stability of the compressed gas , showing that when the core mass exceeds a critical value , @xmath10 , the layer becomes unstable due to combined core and self - gravity and will collapse to much higher densities .",
    "the critical core mass was found to be as high as @xmath11 for conditions thought to be typical in the solar nebula ( see also * ? ? ?",
    ".    however , two complications arise : ( i ) radiation diffusion may transport the compressional heat out , presumably decreasing the temperature of the compressed gas and hence @xmath10 too ; ( ii ) on the other hand , the core may be a significant additional source of heat that acts in the opposite direction . a number of authors @xcite subsequently relaxed the assumption of adibaticity for the gas in the envelope around the core .",
    "assuming thermal energy equilibrium in the envelope instead , they obtained the critical core masses spanning a broader range from @xmath12 to @xmath11 , depending on the outer boundary condition and opacity in the envelope where @xmath13  k is the envelope s temperature in units of 1000  k and @xmath14 is the mean molecular weight of the gas .",
    "this result is only pedagogically interesting , however , as the isothermal assumption is unrealistic for most conditions explored here : the cooling time within the dense envelope near the core can exceed the cooling time of the protoplanet itself and even the age of the universe .",
    "real systems will therefore never reach the isothermal solution and require larger @xmath10 . ] .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for more recent studies of the problem .",
    "these previous studies inform us here and shape our approach . a key difference between this work and",
    "what has been done previously is that we focus on massive clumps born by disc instability .",
    "furthermore , we assume that dense cores readily form in these clumps as a result of grain settling . strictly , the core formation timescale depends on the grain size distribution , but is estimated to be of the order of a few thousand to a few @xmath15 years ( helled et al .",
    ", 2008 ; nayakshin , 2010 ) , which we use in our calculations below . within this context",
    ", we explore the hydrostatic stability of gas near the interface between the dense core and the gaseous envelope .",
    "finally , for the calculations here , we do not simultaneously investigate the full evolution of fragments from their formation .",
    "instead , we isolate the innermost region within evolved clumps ( fragments ) for which an embedded core has an immediate influence .",
    "we define this radius of influence as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the gas sound speed at `` infinity '' , which is the bulk of the mass of a fragment .",
    "the region within @xmath18 defines the atmosphere of the core , which is typically @xmath19  au for core masses @xmath20 m@xmath21 .",
    "the presence of the envelope mass at @xmath22 is treated as an outer boundary condition .",
    "we assume that the gas fragment itself is not tidally limited .",
    "because initial clump sizes can have radii over an au in extent , our assumption of negligible tides implicitly assumes that the clumps are relatively far from their stars .",
    "our calculations are relevant as long as the fragment is dominated by molecular hydrogen and does not fill its roche lobe , which implies generally a distance to the host star of at least @xmath23  au or more , depending on the mass and age of the fragment ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . as an example",
    ", for a @xmath24 years old fragment of 2 m@xmath7 , the corresponding orbital distance must be larger than @xmath3 10 au .    in a fragment with radius @xmath25 ,",
    "the gas density at @xmath26 is equal to the central clump density and is higher than the mean density .",
    "tidal forces are thus negligible inside @xmath18 .",
    "this is in contrast to the ca instability inside a protoplanetary disc , where the outer boundary of the gas atmosphere around the core can be set by the hill s radius .      for simplicity ,",
    "we assume a constant density for the core s internal structure with @xmath27  g  @xmath28 , which reflects the expected density of giant planet cores ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the sensitivity of the results to the chosen core density is investigated below , and found quite weak .",
    "the corresponding core radius is given by @xmath29 . because a fragment is not directly evolved in these models , and to reduce parameter space of our first study , we use the approximate formulae from @xcite to describe gas density and temperature profiles at",
    "any given time @xmath30 after the formation of a fragment , which can be used to derive initial conditions and boundary values .",
    "eventually , we will incorporate the models presented here with simulations that also take into account the global evolution of clumps .",
    "our next steps are identical to what is done in ca studies except for the assumed core luminosity and atmosphere s metallicity structure , as explained in ",
    "[ sec : accretion ] below . starting with the boundary conditions from our evolved fragment models ( actual evolution times given below ) ,",
    "we integrate the equations of hydrostatic and energy transfer equilibrium inward from @xmath31 all the way to the core radius , @xmath32 , using the standard procedure for atmospheric solution finding ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent treatment of the problem ) .",
    "in particular , the hydrostatic balance equation reads @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the mass of the core , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the gas , pressure , and density , respectively , and @xmath37 is the total mass of gas inside radius @xmath38 .",
    "the gas includes an admixture of heavy elements .",
    "energy dissipation within the atmosphere itself is not included in these calculations .",
    "although gravitational contraction will lead to a significant increase in a clump s thermal energy over time , the energy released into the clump from gravitational work is deposited throughout the system , with only a small fraction deposited near the core . since collapse of the material immediately surrounding the core ( its atmosphere ) occurs when its mass is of order the core s mass and the atmosphere s radial extent is a few to ten times that of the core ( cf .",
    "figures 1 and 2 below ) , the total binding energy reservoir of this region must be considerably smaller than the binding energy of the core .",
    "this implies that converting the atmosphere s binding energy into compressional heat is unlikely to result in luminosity exceeding that of the core , except perhaps for a short time . as a result ,",
    "the luminosity that passes through the atmosphere is , to a good approximation , set by the luminosity of the core itself : @xmath39 where @xmath36 and @xmath40 are the gas density and temperature at a distance @xmath38 away from the core s centre .",
    "opacity coefficient @xmath41 is a function of gas density and temperature , and is taken from @xcite , which is an updated version of @xcite opacities .",
    "the treatment of @xmath42 will be discussed below .",
    "the energy transport mechanism in the atmosphere assumed in equation ( [ latm ] ) is radiative diffusion .",
    "however , if the actual temperature gradient , @xmath43 , as calculated from equations ( [ hstatic ] ) and ( [ latm ] ) , is larger than the adiabatic gradient ( the convective stability criterion ) , @xmath44 , the temperature gradient is limited to @xmath45 .",
    "the adiabatic temperature gradient is computed directly from the eos of the mixture .",
    "the eos we use was kindly provided by a.kovetz and is similar to the one recently presented by @xcite . for hydrogen and helium the scvh @xcite eos",
    "is used , while for lower pressures the eos was extended based on the debye approximation for a weakly interacting mixture . for the heavy elements , which are here represented by sio@xmath1 , the eos is based on the quotidian equation of state ( qeos ) described in @xcite .",
    "the density of the mixture is calculated by applying the additive volume law , where the density of the mixture is determined by assuming that the volume of the mixture is the sum of the volumes of the individual components .",
    "the entropy of the mixture is the sum of the entropies of the individual components plus a term for the entropy of mixing @xcite .",
    "the equations of hydrostatic and energy balance just described allow us to integrate the density and temperature profile inwards all the way to the core s boundary , provided that @xmath37 is known .",
    "this is not actually the case , and therefore iterations are required .",
    "setting @xmath46 , we integrate the above equations from @xmath18 to @xmath47 once , and then repeat the procedure with @xmath37 calculated in the previous iteration .",
    "this procedure either converges to some finite value of the atmosphere s mass , yielding a stable structure inside @xmath18  an atmosphere bounded by a massive envelope and a central core , or diverges , resulting in a runaway in the gas density and in the enclosed mass in the atmosphere .",
    "the largest value of @xmath34 at which a stable atmospheric solution exists represents the critical core mass , @xmath10 .",
    "cores can grow at the centre of clumps through the sedimentation of small grains , e.g. , @xmath3 a few cm . in our previous work ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , these grains were assumed to accrete onto a core if they entered the innermost lagrangian gas mass zone , below which the core is located .",
    "however , resolving the gas temperature profile closer to the core may invalidate this assumption since gas near the core is hotter .",
    "grains evaporate rapidly when the surrounding temperature exceeds the grain s vaporisation temperature , @xmath48 , for the given material . even for most of the refractory abundant grains , such as rocks , @xmath49  k ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with the rate of evaporation depending on grain size .",
    "as we show below , the temperature of the gas near the core is higher than 1400 k for all relevant parameter space considered , e.g. , when the core mass increases above @xmath50 .",
    "we note in passing that this also implies that the dense cores of heavy elements that we study here are not necessarily solid .",
    "we simply assume that the core consists of heavy elements and that its density exceeds the surrounding gas density by orders of magnitude , and this is what matters for , e.g. , setting the inner boundary of the atmosphere , @xmath51 . whether the core is solid , liquid , vapour , or ( the most likely )",
    "a mix of these three phases is however important in determining the luminosity of the core , as discussed below .",
    "when the core grows sufficiently massive , grains do not reach the core , but instead sediment down to the innermost region where @xmath52 and evaporate there .",
    "the heavy element content and hence the mean molecular weight of the gas around the core will increase above that of more distant regions ( where @xmath53 and heavy elements continue to sediment as grains ) .",
    "we shall also see that the hot , inner , heavy - element - rich layer is usually strongly dominated by convection .",
    "due to convective mixing , the heavy element material in this region is well mixed with the gas throughout the convective layer , homogenising the heavy element content ( cf .",
    "also * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite have used a similar setup to calculate the critical core mass in the context of the ca model for planet formation .",
    "it was found that the layer `` polluted '' by grains , formed in a way similar as described above , significantly reduces @xmath10 in the limit that the gas becomes dominated by heavy elements . in particular",
    ", @xmath10 may even fall below @xmath54 for heavy element fractions of @xmath55 of the total gas mass .",
    "the main physical reason for such a behaviour is the increase in the mean molecular weight of the gas - heavy element mixture at high @xmath56 ( although latent heat , such as that due to evaporation of grains also helps to reduce @xmath10 ) .",
    "a similar result is found here .",
    "however , we note that at very high-@xmath56 , collapse of a relatively low - mass ( @xmath57 ) heavy - element - rich layer onto the core does not , in general , mark the collapse of the entire fragment .",
    "the gas above the metal - polluted layer has metallicity much closer to the initial heavy element abundance of the gas , although depleted in accordance with the enrichment of the inner layers .",
    "the critical core mass for the gas with a solar - like heavy element abundance is much higher .",
    "therefore , collapse of the polluted heavy - element - rich atmosphere onto the core should strictly be considered as accretion of the inner layer onto the core .",
    "the accreting material is dominated by solids in this regime ( because @xmath58 ) , and only a small fraction @xmath59 of it is hydrogen and helium .",
    "the collapse of the metal - polluted layer is thus effectively a delayed accretion of metals onto the core , which is not very different from a direct accretion of grains onto the core .",
    "similar conclusions were reached by a number of authors in the context of ca model , although incoming high - z material there is in the form of planetesimals ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . on the other hand , the luminosity of the core may be significantly different in these two pictures , as further discussed in section [ sec : core_luminosity ] .",
    "we thus arrive at the following phases of the core growth : ( 1 ) when the mass and the luminosity of the core is low , grain material is able to impact the core directly , as assumed in some previous studies .",
    "( 2 ) when the core mass increases , eventually the gas near the core is hot enough to evaporate the grains . as a result",
    ", grains can evaporate before reaching the core .",
    "their destruction simultaneously creates a heavy - element - polluted layer .",
    "as time progresses , the layer becomes completely dominated by high - z materials and can thus collapse onto the core , increasing its mass .",
    "note that some h / he also accretes onto the core in this process .",
    "( 3 ) as the core grows in mass , less heavy element pollution is required for the high - z layer to collapse .",
    "eventually , layers with @xmath60 are liable to collapse ( this will be calculated below ) . at this point",
    "the core starts to gain as much mass in h / he as in metals , and this marks the beginning of rapid gas accretion onto the core .    therefore , we define the critical core mass as one at which a moderately metal - polluted layer , @xmath61 , can collapse onto the core .",
    "after such a layer collapses , the increased mass of the core enables accretion of relatively metal - poor gas , @xmath62 , for which the presence of metals makes only a minor difference .      in this section",
    "we discuss the luminosity of the core , which can play a significant role in setting @xmath10 . in the core accretion model ,",
    "it is customary to write @xmath63 where @xmath64 is largely the planetesimal accretion rate onto a core .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , small grain accretion is necessarily complicated by grain evaporation and mixing with h / he in the heavy - element - polluted layer , which is also true in core accretion .",
    "furthermore , when the heavy - element - rich layer does collapse onto the core , it is unclear how quickly the compressional heat gained in the collapse will escape from the core region .",
    "these uncertainties are physically related to the difficult issue of determining how much heat is retained by gas that is accreted onto low - mass stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or onto giant planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "one can parameterise the energy retained per unit mass of accreted matter as @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is an unknown factor between 0 and 1 .",
    "different values of @xmath66 can lead to very different evolution histories , e.g. , for stellar radius and luminosity in the two opposite limits ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "when @xmath67 , the accretion is called  cold `` , and models that use these conditions have a ' ' cold start .",
    "`` when @xmath68 ( as opposed to being very small , i.e. , @xmath69 ) , the accretion is `` hot '' , and corresponding models have a ' ' hot start . \"    while there are many similarities between core accretion and core sedimentation , there are also important differences .",
    "when core formation occurs within a gaseous clump as studied here , the core is buried deep in a very optically thick gas . as a result",
    ", the energy can not be radiated away easily . to reflect this change , and the uncertain energy release rate under the accretion of heavy - element - polluted layers , we parameterise the energy loss from the core as @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the kelvin - helmholtz contraction time of the solid core .",
    "the value of @xmath71 , which is taken to be a free parameter in our model , is varied over a broad range below .",
    "although the exact value of @xmath71 is unclear , there is a lower limit on @xmath71 imposed by the assembly time of the core .",
    "for example , compare equation ( [ l_kh ] ) with equation ( [ l_ca ] ) , and let us also assume that all the accreted heat is being rapidly radiated away from the core . in this case @xmath71",
    "should be replaced by the time scale on which the core grows , @xmath72 , and the accretion luminosity given by equation ( [ l_ca ] ) is recovered . from evolutionary calculations of fragments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath73 is from a few @xmath74 to @xmath75 yr .",
    "for this reason , we take @xmath24 yr as a rough representative cooling timescale .",
    "we do note that understanding the cooling timescale of clumps is an active area of research , with some groups finding , for certain conditions , very fast cooling times @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the heat may be trapped inside the core for times much longer than @xmath73 . to explore a low - luminosity limit",
    ", we also consider values of @xmath71 in the range of @xmath76 yrs .",
    "we now consider an isolated gas clump of mass @xmath77 at time @xmath78 yr from the fragment s birth .",
    "this is motivated by the typical cooling time scale for the clumps , and is also consistent within an order of magnitude with the clump migration timescale into the inner disc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the fragment is dominated by molecular hydrogen , so that the mean molecular weight at @xmath79 is set to @xmath80 .",
    "the typical clump densities and temperatures in the centre of our clumps are estimated by using the analytical study of @xcite .",
    "in particular , we set the clump radius @xmath81  au  @xmath82 .",
    "the temperature and mean density of the clump are then @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively .",

    "all of these are computed in the limit of a relatively short @xmath71 , which we set to @xmath89  yrs . panels ( a ) and ( b ) show the gas temperature and density structure , respectively . as expected , the atmosphere near the solid core becomes denser and hotter as @xmath34 increases .",

    "the outer boundary @xmath91 .",
    "note the jump in density by about a factor of 2 in panel ( b ) .",
    "this is the point where the metallicity of the gas is assumed to jump discontinuously from @xmath92 ( @xmath93 , outer regions ) to @xmath61 ( @xmath52 ) , inner region .",
    "the gas temperature and pressure , @xmath94 , are continuous across this transition , but the gas density @xmath36 and the mean molecular weight @xmath14 are both discontinuous by the same factor across the kink .",
    "panel ( c ) of figure [ fig : fig1 ] displays the ratio of the enclosed mass of the atmosphere , @xmath37 , to the core mass , @xmath34 .",
    "this ratio is found to increase strongly with @xmath34 .",
    "the three lower core mass cases in figure [ fig : fig1 ] show stable atmospheres that increase in mass proportionally with the core mass .",
    "the fourth case , which is the highest core mass case ( solid curve ) , however , is qualitatively different .",
    "the atmosphere mass in this case is comparable to that of the core . at a core mass",
    "just slightly larger than 45  @xmath88 , we find no static atmosphere solution ; the atmosphere collapses dynamically .",
    "therefore , the critical core mass in the @xmath95 m@xmath7 , short @xmath71 , case is @xmath96 .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2 ] shows a very similar calculation but for a long @xmath97 case , @xmath98  yr . the core masses in this case are @xmath99 = 1 , 3 , 10 and 12.5  @xmath88 . by comparing figures ( [ fig : fig2 ] ) and ( [ fig : fig1 ] ) , it is found that the atmosphere is much more dense in the long @xmath71 case models , as expected : brighter cores require hotter atmospheres to transport the heat flux away .",
    "for this reason , the atmospheric collapse occurs at @xmath100 , which is at a much lower core mass than in the short @xmath71 case .    to put these values of @xmath34 in perspective",

    "this procedure could be used in a fully self - consistent calculation for which the properties of the gas clump and the rate of grain sedimentation are calculated as a function of time .",
    "the critical core mass then depends on the time evolution of the clump , and the value needed to induce collapse may or may not be reached .",
    "for example , the gas clump may contract and heat up too quickly for significant grain sedimentation and core formation to take place @xcite .    in a yet more self - consistent calculation ,",
    "the clump properties depend on its changing environment as it migrates inward .",
    "as noted in section [ intro ] , the clump may be even destroyed by tidal forces from the parent star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the highest luminosity case considered , @xmath114  yr is shown with a dot - dash red curve to distinguish it from the @xmath115  yr case .    the thin dash - dotted ( blue ) line on the bottom of the figure , marked `` isothermal '' , shows the isothermal critical core mass , @xmath116 , corresponding to the non - accreting and non - radiating core ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this @xmath117 limiting case is non - realistic as gas cooling time near the surface of the core may be too long for the thermal equilibrium to be achieved ( see the footnote in  [ sec : motivation ] ) , but it is nonetheless instructive as an ( analytical ) absolute lower limit to @xmath10 .",

    "figure [ fig : param1 ] shows , as expected , that any @xmath120 core ( @xmath121 ) requires a core mass larger than @xmath116 to enforce atmosphere collapse because the atmosphere around a luminous core is hotter .",
    "the least bright core case studied here , @xmath122 yrs , is the solid curve that gives the lowest values of @xmath10 .",
    "analysis of atmospheric profiles of the respective models shows that the atmospheres on the flat part of the solid curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : param1 ] ( marked by `` part radiative '' in the figure ) contain both convective and radiative regions .",
    "we should expect in this regime that the brighter the core is ( the shorter @xmath71 ) , the more massive the core must be to cause the atmosphere to collapse .",
    "this trend is to be expected from the well known radiative zero solution for atmospheres ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the atmosphere mass scales as @xmath123 , so that higher @xmath124 reduces @xmath125 at a given @xmath126 .",
    "this explains why the critical core mass increases with decreasing @xmath71 on the flat part of the solid curves .",
    "the reason that the curves in this regime are almost independent of the clump mass , @xmath111 , is that the radiative zero solutions are dominated by regions very close to the cores , and are hence insensitive to @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "sensitivity of @xmath10 to the core luminosity however becomes weaker and weaker as @xmath71 decreases , particularly for low - mass clumps .",
    "this is obvious from the top few solid curves in the figure , which become very closely spaced .",
    "in fact , models with @xmath127  yr saturate at a single curve ( dash - dot red ) .",
    "the atmosphere of this limiting solution is fully convective , so that @xmath128 is independent of @xmath124 everywhere .",
    "the dash - dot red curve also marks this fully convective limiting solution .",
    "the solution corresponds to the fully convective , and thus adiabatic , atmospheres studied first by @xcite , and also leads to very large values for @xmath10 . considering the upper curves in figure [ fig : param1 ] , we find that the approximate relation @xmath129 matches the fully convective limit within @xmath130% .",
    "the linear behaviour of @xmath10 with increasing @xmath111 can be obtained analytically by assuming that the atmosphere remains adiabatic with a constant specific heats ratio , @xmath131 ( which is not exactly the case here , explaining why the curve is not quite linear ) .",
    "the dotted thin lines in figure ( [ fig : param1 ] ) are lines of a constant ratio @xmath1320.005 , 0.01 , 0.02 , and 0.1 , from bottom to top , respectively .",
    "these lines are useful in determining the parameters of the clumps that may host a core that is massive enough to initiate a core - assisted gas capture ( cagc ) instability at a given clump metallicity .",
    "if the curve ( of a fixed @xmath71 ) is above the line , then it is not possible to trigger cagc for the given heavy element fraction and total clump mass , even if all the heavy elements sedimented into the core .",
    "for example , at half of the solar heavy element abundance ( second from bottom dotted line ) , the maximum core mass would be @xmath133 . under these conditions",
    ", only gas clumps more massive than @xmath134 could possibly provoke collapse and only if @xmath98  yr ( second from bottom solid curve ) or longer . if @xmath135  yr then no clump of this metallicity could ever collapse via the cagc instability .",
    "evidently , assembling a core that is massive enough to induce atmosphere collapse is very difficult for systems that have low nominal heavy element fractions ( i.e. , low metallicity systems ) .",
    "increasing the available budget of grains clearly improves the chances of reaching the critical core mass , creating a potentially strong dependence on heavy element abundance .",
    "nonetheless , the exact form of this dependence is unclear from our study alone , and requires future additional work .",
    "in this paper we have assumed a fixed core density , @xmath136  g  @xmath28 .",
    "density of the core could in principle be higher than this for very massive cores due to their large self - gravity .",
    "alternatively , the core density could also be significantly lower than assumed here , especially for young hot cores ( say , @xmath137 yr ) which have not yet been able to radiate away the primordial heat of their formation . to test sensitivity of our results to the assumed value of @xmath138 , we rerun some of the calculations presented in figure [ fig : param1 ] for two additional values of core density , @xmath139  g  @xmath28 , and @xmath140  g  @xmath28 .",
    "figure [ fig : rho_core ] shows the results of this experiment with the dotted and the dashed curves , respectively , for these two values of the core densities .",
    "the solid curves reproduce the corresponding curves from figure [ fig : param1 ] .",
    "we conclude that the dependence of @xmath10 on @xmath138 is quite weak .",
    "an increase in @xmath138 by a factor of three leads to at most a @xmath20% increase in the value of @xmath10 , whereas a ten - fold decrease in @xmath138 decreases the critical mass by at most 30% .",
    "we interpret the insensitivity of the critical core mass to the value of @xmath138 as being due to a near cancellation of two opposing effects . on the one hand ,",
    "a denser core of a given mass commands a higher gravity , pulling the surrounding gas closer in and thus increasing the chance of the gravitational collapse of the atmosphere . on the other hand",
    ", a denser core also implies a higher luminosity ( under the assumption of a fixed cooling time ) , since @xmath141 , which makes the collapse less likely as discussed in previous sections of the paper .",
    "a crucial argument was made in ",
    "[ sec : accretion ] : the collapse of a _ metal - dominated _ atmosphere does not in general signal the beginning of a runaway _ gas _ accretion onto the core .",
    "moreover , we argued that @xmath142 ( and not higher ) is the critical metallicity for understanding the collapse of the entire system .",
    "this model assumption is in variance to @xcite who suggested that critical core mass for core accretion instability can be greatly reduced for strongly metal - polluted gas , so that @xmath10 is as small as @xmath143 for @xmath55 .",
    "we test the sensitivity of our results to the metallicity @xmath144 of the atmosphere by varying the value of @xmath145 over a broad range .",
    "this also allows us to explore examples of systems for which the atmosphere should collapse , but the clump as a whole should not , as well as systems for which the instability of the atmosphere can drive the collapse of the entire clump .",
    "figure [ fig : z_crit ] shows a number of calculations identical to those done in  [ sec : param ] , except just one particular core cooling time is used ( @xmath146  yr ) and the metallicity is varied from @xmath147 to @xmath148 , as labelled on the figure .",
    "figure [ fig : z_crit ] confirms that higher metallicity gas is more susceptible to gravitational collapse ( since @xmath10 is lower for higher values of @xmath145 ) . in this sense",
    "our results agree qualitatively with that of @xcite .",
    "however , our results also show that the collapse of a metal - dominated atmosphere does not obviously cause the collapse of the rest of the gas clump , which is assumed to have `` normal '' metallicity , e.g. , that of the protoplanetary disc . to see this , consider the evolution of a growing , low - mass core , say @xmath149 a few @xmath88",
    ". only a highly metal - polluted layer , @xmath150 , could become gravitationally unstable around such a low - mass core .",
    "for definitiveness , consider @xmath151 and @xmath152 case , for which @xmath153 .",
    "if the mass of the core roughly doubles when the whole metal polluted layer collapses onto the core ( because such a collapse occurs when the mass of the metal - rich atmosphere is comparable to that of the core ) , we would have an @xmath154 core after the collapse .",
    "this is insufficient to induce collapse of the gas beyond the metal polluted layer . for the particular example at hand ,",
    "a core mass of @xmath155 is needed to induce the further collapse of an atmosphere at @xmath156 .",
    "a new metal - polluted layer would have to build up , and that would collapse at @xmath157 or so for @xmath158 .",
    "collapse of the entire clump , however , seems to become possible if the instability in the atmosphere occurs at @xmath60 .",
    "for example , the critical core mass for such a `` moderately '' polluted atmosphere is @xmath159 .",
    "if @xmath34 does approximately double after this collapse , then even a normal metallicity gas , @xmath160 , becomes unstable to @xmath161 .",
    "collapse of a @xmath60 atmospheric layer can thus potentially start the collapse of the gas fragment itself .",
    "earlier collapses of metal - dominated layers should be interpreted as _",
    "core accretion _ , albeit delayed and with some hydrogen rather than a true beginning of the gas accretion runaway phase .",
    "we have used the opacity of @xcite in this paper up to now , which includes dust , molecular , atomic , and electron scattering opacities in a tabulated format .",
    "unfortunately , these tables assume the single ( solar ) metallicity value , @xmath160 .",
    "the grey opacity can be much higher for a higher metallicity gas .",
    "for example , for dust opacity , a simple approximation is to assume that the opacity is directly proportional to the gas metallicity ( although changes in opacity due to grain growth could render this approximation questionable * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "clearly , @xmath10 does depend on the opacity that is used , and it is important to at least estimate how strongly . following grain growth and chemistry in detail is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "instead , we adopt the simple approach and assume that the grey opacity is directly proportional @xmath56 . in particular , we multiply all the opacity sources from @xcite by the factor @xmath162 , except electron scattering , which is only important at very high @xmath40 .    as done in figure [ fig : z_crit ] ,",
    "figure [ fig : opacity ] explores the model @xmath146  yr as a function of the metallicity of the polluted layer , but now with the increased opacities , as described above ( solid curves ) . the same range of values for the layer s metallicity is used in both figures .",
    "the dashed curve is the @xmath152 model from figure [ fig : z_crit ] plotted again for comparison .",
    "we see that increasing the opacity increases the critical mass for collapse of the atmosphere , consistent with one s intuition and with the more detailed study of @xcite .",
    "fortunately , this increase in @xmath126 is relatively small , e.g. , only by a factor of @xmath163 for the highest metallicity case , in which the opacities were increased by the factor of @xmath164 .",
    "this shows that opacity is indeed important in regulating the critical core mass , but less so than the metallicity of the metal - polluted layer .",
    "we draw a parallel here with previous work of @xcite who found that the critical core mass for atmosphere collapse in the ca theory scales as a very weak power - law of the opacity : @xmath165 , where @xmath166 .",
    "value of @xmath167 , in particular , is consistent with the increase of @xmath10 by a factor of 2 as opacity increases by a factor of 40 .",
    "the physical reason for this behavior appears to be the fact that most of the atmosphere s mass is located rather close to the core , where gas densities are very high ( see e.g. , figure 2 ) , so that the convective rather than the radiative energy flux dominates .",
    "finally , our standard value for the age of the gas clump was set to @xmath168 yr so far .",
    "this is a reasonable estimate for the gas fragment migration time scale and the dust sedimentation time scale within the clump .",
    "however , a gas fragment s thermal evolution may be affected by irradiation from the surrounding disc and the parent star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the migration time may vary depending on the disc properties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "hence it is prudent to ask how our results depend on the age of the clump .",
    "figure [ fig : age ] presents the critical core mass as a function of gas clump s mass , @xmath111 , for just one value of @xmath169  yr , but for four different values of @xmath170 , from @xmath171  yr to @xmath172 yr .",
    "the dominant effect seen in the figure is due to the contraction ( and corresponding heating ) of the clump with time .",
    "for example , clumps with a mass higher than @xmath173 are hotter than @xmath174  k in the simple model of @xcite , so that grain sedimentation and core growth is not possible at this time .",
    "this is why the dashed curve continues only to this mass ; higher mass clumps of this age would be too hot to continue accreting cores by grain sedimentation .",
    "this figure , along with the standard parameter search shown in figure [ fig : param1 ] , demonstrates that the internal structure of the gas fragment ",
    "controlled primarily by the clump s mass _ and _ age  changes the critical mass @xmath10 most strongly .",
    "future detailed investigations coupling the gas clump with the disc are required .",
    "we used a series of 1d simple hydrostatic structure models to explore the stability of heavy element - rich atmospheres surrounding cores that are embedded deep within gaseous clumps .",
    "the clumps are envisaged to have formed through the fragmentation of gravitationally unstable protoplanetary discs , while the cores are assumed to have formed through grain sedimentation .",
    "our calculations show that the core s atmosphere , i.e. , the gas immediately surrounding the core , can become unstable and collapse for a range of fragment and core masses , as well as core luminosities . while the collapse of a core s atmosphere in and of itself does not immediately imply that the entire clump will be unstable , experiments with the 1d radiation hydrodynamical code presented in @xcite did lead to the whole gas clump collapsing on a dynamical time scale for a few test problems explored .",
    "since such a clump collapse is driven by h2 molecule dissociation and h atom ionisation presenting very large energy sinks it seems reasonable to expect the whole clump collapsing once core atmosphere / envelope becomes unstable .",
    "this suggests that a disc fragment could form a gas giant planet via a novel channel that is discovered here .",
    "namely , traditionally giant planet formation by gravitationally unstable discs is believed to occur via radiative cooling and contraction of self - gravitating gas fragments ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "dust plays a passive ( albeit important ) role in this traditional picture by providing and regulating the opacity of the fragment ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in the picture developed in our paper , however , the dust plays a dynamically important role . by accumulating into a massive dense core in the centre",
    ", dust may provide a significant destabilising effect onto the whole gas fragment .",
    "this newly discovered core - assisted gas capture instability ( cagc ) is closely linked to the well known core accretion instability @xcite .    to enable a quantitative study of the cagc",
    ", we made a number of model choices and simplifying assumptions .",
    "the gas fragment is assumed to be isolated from external influences and its structure is approximated by a very simple analytical model of @xcite .",
    "the dense core has a fixed density and its luminosity is given by the binding energy divided by a cooling time , @xmath71 , which is an important free parameter .",
    "the region closest to the core is metal polluted in our model since grains vaporise when @xmath175  k. we argued that gas fragment collapse can be trigerred only if metallicity of the polluted layer is @xmath176 as opposed to the limit @xmath150 . within these assumptions ,",
    "our main quantitative results are as follows :",
    "1 .   the critical core mass , @xmath10 , that triggers the collapse of a core s atmosphere is dependent most strongly on the central density and temperature of the fragment , as well as the luminosity of the core .",
    "more luminous cores ( which corresponds to shorter @xmath71 ) have more tenuous atmospheres , as expected , and hence brighter cores must be more massive to provoke the collapse ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : param1 ] ) . as a numerical example , in a 2 m@xmath7 clump of @xmath24 years of age from its birth , a core mass greater than @xmath177 is required to cause collapse if the cooling time of the core is @xmath24 yr .",
    "`` only '' @xmath178 is however needed for a cooling time of @xmath98 yr .",
    "since protoplanetary discs seem to disappear on time scale of order a few million years , the most interesting value of @xmath71 to explore is of order 1 million years or less ( see  [ sec : di ] below on this point ) .",
    "the critical core mass is then ( fig .",
    "[ fig : param1 ] ) between @xmath179 and @xmath180 , depending on properties of the gas fragment .",
    "less massive and younger gas fragments require smaller @xmath10 at the same @xmath71 ( cf . figures [ fig : param1 ] and [ fig : age ] ) .",
    "atmospheres of bright ( short @xmath71 ) cores are convective , whereas atmospheres of dim ( long @xmath71 ) cores are at least partially radiative . for our default opacity ,",
    "the atmospheres become completely convective at cooling times of @xmath181 yr . in this case , the critical core mass is a function of the central pressure and temperature in the clump . at a given clump age and a clump opacity law , these are a function of the total clump mass , so the critical core mass becomes insensitive to the core luminosity / cooling times in the limit of shortest @xmath71 ( cf . the upper enveloping ( red ) curve in figure [ fig : param1 ] ) .",
    "@xmath10 is very weakly dependent on the core density and opacity in the envelope (   5.1 and 5.3 ) .",
    "the collapse of gas fragments to much higher proto - planetary densities via cagc is strongly dependent on the availability of heavy elements , as larger critical core masses can only be reached for high initial metallicity .",
    "_ therefore , based on these results , a strong positive correlation between frequency of giant planets and metallicity may be expected with cagc_. low metallicity environments may be dominated by clumps that undergo collapse through h@xmath1 dissociation .      in the disc instability paradigm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , gas fragments of a few jupiter masses are born in the outer cold and massive disc due to self - gravity instability .",
    "these fragments then cool and eventually collapse via hydrogen molecule dissociation in the fragment @xcite . rapid inward migration of clumps ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may however lead to their destruction due to tides or irradiation @xcite or tidal disruption @xcite .",
    "it is hence only those clumps that contracted before they were disrupted that may leave behind giant planets .",
    "the newly found cagc instability is an additional channel via which gas fragments may collapse .",
    "dust growth and sedimentation into a core can be faster than the time taken by the fragments to cool to h@xmath1 dissociation , especially for fragments less massive than a few jupiter masses @xcite .",
    "furthermore , such fragments are also most vulnerable to external irradiation which slows down theor cooling even further @xcite",
    ". therefore , cagc may be the dominant channel through which such relatively low - mass fragments collapse to become giant planets .",
    "we caution however that much more work is needed to test these ideas .",
    "adding a self - consistent evolutionary model for the internal structure of a fragment interacting with the disc and the protostar and migrating inward is essential .",
    "in addition , there are several physical processes such as turbulence and magnetic fields which are not included in this work .",
    "these processes could affect the formation of clumps by gravitational instability and should be included in future disc and planet formation models .",
    "turbulence could also slow down formation of cores inside the fragments .",
    "1 .   presence of a massive core . based on the older variants of disc instability models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that do not include planet migration and tidal stripping of the fragments , it is tempting to use the presence of a core in a gas giant as _ prima facie _ evidence of formation by core accretion plus gas capture , as core accretion _ requires _ the formation of a core ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while fragmentation by disc instability does not .",
    "however , as emphasized here , core formation could occur nonetheless through grain sedimentation ( e.g. , boss 1997 , 1998 ; helled & schubert 2008 ; helled et al .",
    "2008 ; nayakshin 2010 ; boley et al .",
    "2010 , 2011 ; forgan & rice 2013 ) , and more importantly , if it does , can promote the collapse of the fragment if the core s mass exceeds @xmath10 .",
    "sedimentation can hence erase or severely confuse using internal structure as evidence for a given formation mode , particularly if the formation of a heavy element core in a fragment can also lead to variations in final bulk composition , as discussed next .",
    "+ since the presence of a core can be explained by both formation scenarios it becomes harder to discriminate among the two models based on the core s mass .",
    "while it is still widely believed that small cores are more consistent with disc instability while massive cores are a natural outcome of core accretion , we found in this paper that reality may be much more complex . even the extreme cases ( i.e.",
    ", no core at all versus a very massive core ) do not implicate the formation process directly .",
    "this is due to the fact that very massive cores can also form in the disc instability picture if enrichment from birth and/or planetesimal capture occur , while no or very small cores are not inconsistent with core accretion if core erosion takes place .",
    "we therefore suggest once more , that core mass should not be used as a proof for a given formation model .",
    "in addition , one has to keep in mind that core masses are inferred only indirectly from models of their interior stucture ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . for extrasolar giant planets",
    "it is not currently possible to distinguish between the total heavy element enrichment and high core masses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "planet composition .",
    "planets born by disc instability are often assumed to have the same composition as their host stars .",
    "however , several processes can occur that could potentially alter this ( e.g. , see review by * ? ? ?",
    "as discussed above , the formation of a core in a clump must simultaneously deplete the clump s envelope of heavy elements .",
    "if core - assisted gas capture has occurred prior to the loss of the clump s envelope during disc migration , then any gas that is lost to the disc through tides would be preferentially depleted in heavy elements .",
    "any remaining planet could thus appear to be significantly enriched in heavy elements .",
    "giant planet frequency of occurence in the inner fraction of an au was found to be a strongly increasing function of metallicity of the host star @xcite .",
    "this has been traditionally interpreted as evidence for formation of these planets via core accretion picture .",
    "our results however show that metal rich fragments born by the disc instability are more likely to collapse via cagc , and it is thus possible that the observed correlation could be recovered by this model as well ( cf .  [ sec : param ] and point ( vi ) in  [ sec : main ] ) .",
    "this result is potentially exciting , but further work is required to better understand the dependence of cagc on metallicity . on one hand , high heavy element abundances implies higher opacities and longer overall clump cooling times and perhaps larger cores @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , high initial abundances could prompt prodigious grain growth . while this should promote a faster core growth",
    ", it could also actually decrease the overall cooling time of the clump ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the uncertainty in opacity due to grain growth is however also a concern for the ca model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "+ despite these uncertainties , it seems unlikely for cagc to be important for clumps more massive than a few to @xmath20 jupiter masses , because such clumps are unable to form massive solid cores quicker than they heat up to vaporise their grains @xcite .",
    "therefore , even under most optimistic assumptions about the cagc contribution to forming giant gas planets , it seems highly unlikely that cagc could explain planet - metallicity correlation for planets more massive than @xmath20 jupiter masses .",
    "`` modern '' versions of the disc instability model , e.g. , those that include core formation , fragment migration and disruption ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "<S> in contrast , in the disc instability paradigm , giant planet formation is believed to be independent of core formation : massive self - gravitating gas fragments cool radiatively and collapse as a whole independently of whether there is a core .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we show that giant planet formation in the disc instability model may be also enhanced by core formation for reasons physically very similar to the ca paradigm . in the model </S>",
    "<S> explored here , efficient grain sedimentation within an initial fragment ( rather than the disc ) leads to the formation of a core composed of heavy elements . </S>",
    "<S> we find that massive atmospheres form around cores and undergo collapse as a critical core mass is exceeded , analogous to ca theory . </S>",
    "<S> the critical mass of the core to initiate such a collapse depends on the fragment mass and metallicity , as well as core luminosity , but ranges from less than 1 to as much as @xmath0 earth masses . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore suggest that there are two channels for the collapse of a gaseous fragment to planetary scales within the disc instability model : ( i ) h@xmath1 dissociative collapse of the entire gaseous clump , and ( ii ) core - assisted gas capture , as presented here . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the first of these two is favoured in metal - poor environments and for fragments @xmath2 jupiter masses , whereas the second is favored in metal - rich environments and fragments of lower mass .    </S>",
