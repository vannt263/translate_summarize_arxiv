    ", such scheme faces the usual scalability problem of quantum computation .",
    "our method of information compression uses the multiplet decomposition of the whole space of spin states of the memory , instead of addressing each qubit separately .",
    "doing so , we avoid the problem of decoherence caused by the local information transmission to a given qubit , which constrains miniaturization of information processing devices and implies extra restrictions on geometric equality of memory elements .    addressing different spin states of the whole system , rather than different quantum bits , can allow for a  flexible  memory elements ( say , on aperiodic sequences of quantum dots @xcite ) .",
    "the price paid for such flexibility is the spectroscopic problem to distinguish reliably the spin states of quantum system containing 2 , 4 and more @xmath60 spins .",
    "since the size of the physical support of the group of spins , manipulated spectroscopically , say a group of excess electrons in quantum dots , is comparable to the size of single qubit of the same nature , our method possibly provides a new way of miniaturization of memory elements on nanoscale heterostructures .",
