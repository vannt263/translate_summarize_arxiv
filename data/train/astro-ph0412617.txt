    "the world data set of ultra - high energy cosmic rays is currently dominated by data recorded with the akeno giant air shower array ( agasa ) between 1989 and 2003 .",
    "agasa has published arrival directions of 57 cosmic - ray events above @xmath0ev obtained up to may 2000  @xcite .",
    "the high resolution fly s eye ( hires ) experiment in utah has operated in stereo mode since 1999 . the published agasa data set and the hires stereo data set overlap only a few months in time , but both detectors observe approximately the same part of the northern sky . with 27 events above @xmath0ev recorded through january 2004",
    ", the hires data set now contributes significantly to the world ultra - high energy data set : thus it becomes increasingly interesting to search for possible point sources in this _ combined _ data set .    in combining the two data sets",
    ", we need to account for the different errors on the individual cosmic - ray arrival directions as well as for the different background expectations in the two experiments .",
    "in addition , the analysis method should be `` unbinned , '' at least in the sense that any error from binning is much smaller than other errors in the data .",
    "this means that we do not define a fixed maximum angular separation for events to form a multiplet .",
    "rather , we search over the whole hires / agasa sky for possible point source positions",
    ".    for analyzing a data set combining events with very different errors , the maximum likelihood method is particularly well suited .",
    "we perform a likelihood ratio test of the hypothesis that several events in the skymap come from a common source . in other words",
    ", we test whether any given position on the sky harbors a source which contributes @xmath1 source events to the data set . the likelihood of this hypothesis is compared to the null hypothesis @xmath2 and this likelihood ratio is maximized using @xmath3 as a free parameter . by calculating the likelihood ratio for a dense grid of points on the sky , we essentially search the entire sky for the most likely position of a source of @xmath3 events .",
    "the statistical significance can be estimated by applying the same method to a large set of random isotropic data sets and evaluating what fraction of them have a likelihood ratio which is equal to or larger than the ratio observed in the real data described above .",
    "it should be noted that it is not obvious that a study of cosmic ray arrival directions will help identify their sources , because charged particles suffer deflections in galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields .",
    "the strengths of these fields are poorly known .",
    "several authors have recently published estimates on the size of the expected deflections , and the results differ considerably  @xcite .",
    "the point source search reported in this paper could be fruitful only if deflections at energies above @xmath0 ev are sufficiently weak , making cosmic ray astronomy possible .",
    "the agasa data set has been intensively studied and described in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the hires stereo data set is relatively new , so we will describe it in more detail in section 2 .",
    "section 3 gives a description of the likelihood method applied here .",
    "results from the analysis of the combined data set are described in section 4 . in section 5 ,",
    "we test the likelihood method with simulated data sets , and a discussion follows in section 6 .",
    "hires is a stereo air fluorescence experiment with two sites ( hires 1 and 2 ) at the us army dugway proving ground in the utah desert ( @xmath4west longitude , @xmath5north latitude , with a vertical atmospheric depth of @xmath6 ) .",
    "the two sites are separated by a distance of 12.6 km .",
    "the ultra - high energy cosmic ray flux is small and is a steeply falling power law in energy .",
    "thus experiments at ultra - high energies need a large detector volume .",
    "consequently , the primary cosmic ray particles can not be observed directly , since they interact in the upper atmosphere and induce extensive air showers with of the order of @xmath7 particles for a @xmath8ev primary .",
    "the properties of the original cosmic ray particle , such as arrival direction and energy , have to be inferred from the observed properties of the extensive air shower . in hires ,",
    "this is achieved by observing the fluorescence light produced when particles of the extensive air shower interact with nitrogen molecules in the atmosphere .",
    "this method has the advantage that the shower development in the atmosphere is imaged and important quantities like the shower size and the height of the shower maximum can be determined directly . if the shower is viewed simultaneously by two detectors in stereo mode , the arrival direction can be reconstructed with an accuracy of less than @xmath9 .",
    "the main shortcoming of the technique is the low duty cycle of only about @xmath10 , as air fluorescence detectors can only be operated on dark , moonless nights with good atmospheric conditions .    to observe fluorescence light from air showers ,",
    "the detector at each site is made up of several telescope units monitoring different parts of the night sky . with 22 ( 42 ) telescopes at the first ( second ) site , the full detector covers about @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) in azimuth and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) in elevation above horizon .",
    "each telescope consists of a mirror with an area of about @xmath15 area for light collection and a cluster of 256 photomultiplier tubes in the focal plane .",
    "the shower geometry is determined by a global @xmath16 minimization using both the timing and pointing information from all tubes . from measurements of laser tracks and stars in the field of view of the cameras we estimate that the systematic error in the arrival direction determination is not larger than @xmath17 , mainly caused by uncertainties in the survey of mirror pointing directions .",
    "various aspects of the hires detector and the reconstruction procedures are described in  @xcite .",
    "for the present analysis , we use stereo data taken between december 1999 and january 2004 .",
    "this sample is subject to the same quality cuts used in  @xcite .",
    "a minimum track length of @xmath18 in each detector , an estimated angular uncertainty in both azimuth and zenith angle of less than @xmath19 , and a zenith angle less than @xmath20 are required .",
    "in addition , the estimated energy uncertainty is required to be less than @xmath21 and @xmath22 for both the energy and the geometry fit .",
    "a total of 27 events above @xmath0ev pass the selection criteria .",
    "an atmospheric data base built from the reconstruction of laser shots is used to correct for the impact of the atmospheric conditions on the reconstruction of events .",
    "the data base contains hourly values of parameters describing the aerosol content of the atmosphere .",
    "simulations show that after correcting for the aerosol content , the impact on the event geometry and energy is small for a wide range of different atmospheric conditions .",
    "the angular resolution of hires is determined using simulated showers generated with corsika 6  @xcite and qgsjet for the first interaction .",
    "after the quality cuts described above , 68% of all showers generated at @xmath8ev are reconstructed within @xmath23 of the true shower direction .",
    "the angular resolution depends weakly on energy .",
    "the 68% error radius grows to @xmath24 and @xmath25 for showers generated at @xmath26ev and @xmath27ev , respectively , because showers at higher energy are farther away , on average .",
    "the maximum likelihood method used here is outlined in  @xcite ; a useful and clarifying application to the problem of finding a deficit from the position of the moon in a cosmic ray skymap may be found in  @xcite . for a general description of likelihood methods ,",
    "see for example  @xcite and references therein .",
    "the likelihood method can be applied both in searches for emission from _ a priori _ selected source locations , and in searches for the most likely location of such a point source on the whole sky .",
    "consider first a fixed source location in right ascension and declination : @xmath28 . given a sample of @xmath29 cosmic ray events ,",
    "we suppose that @xmath3 events come from the source location @xmath30 , and that the remaining @xmath31 events are random background events .",
    "if the @xmath32th event is a source event , then its true arrival direction is @xmath30 .",
    "the probability density for finding it at some location @xmath33 is given by the function @xmath34 , derived from the angular errors of the event and the angular displacement between @xmath30 and @xmath33 .",
    "on the other hand , if the @xmath32th event is a background event , then the probability density for finding it at a location @xmath33 is given by the function @xmath35 , derived from the relative exposure of the detector to an isotropic background of cosmic rays .",
    "the subscript is necessary because @xmath36 depends on whether event @xmath32 is a hires or agasa event .",
    "each of these functions is normalized to unity over positions @xmath33 in the sky .",
    "we do not hypothesize which individual events are source or background events .",
    "we only suppose that there are @xmath37 events in the sample that come from some source position @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , the partial probability distribution of arrival directions @xmath33 for the @xmath32th event is given by : @xmath38 it follows that the probability of finding the @xmath32th event at the location @xmath39 ( where it is actually observed ) is @xmath40 .",
    "the likelihood for the entire set of @xmath29 events is then given by : @xmath41 the best estimate for the number of source events , under the assumption of a point source located at @xmath42 , is determined by finding the value of @xmath3 which maximizes @xmath43 .",
    "because the value of the likelihood function depends on the number of events , a more useful quantity than @xmath43 is the likelihood ratio @xmath44 : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the likelihood function of the _ null hypothesis _ ( @xmath2 ) . in practice , we maximize @xmath47 , which is equivalent to maximizing @xmath43 .",
    "the method described so far is sufficient for testing a specific source position @xmath30 . to search the entire sky for the source position with the strongest signal ,",
    "we calculate the likelihood ratio @xmath47 for a dense grid of points on the sky covering the full range of equatorial coordinates accessible to agasa and hires .",
    "the source position is essentially treated as a free parameter , along with the number of source events @xmath3 .",
    "searching for the parameters @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath3 which maximize the likelihood ratio will therefore give us the best estimate for the position of the source and the number of events it contributes .",
    "the search proceeds as follows .",
    "the visible region of the sky is divided into a fine grid of points with separations @xmath50 and @xmath51 in @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "each point is treated in turn as a source location @xmath30 . at each point , the specific quantities @xmath54 and @xmath55 are required for every event .",
    "the source probability density function @xmath54 depends on the angular resolution associated with the @xmath32th event , which in principle may depend on several quantities including energy , zenith angle , etc .",
    "the background probability density function @xmath55 depends on the detector exposure to different parts of the sky : it is generally the same function for all events observed by a given detector , but may in principle be a function of e.g. energy as well . for each event",
    ", @xmath54 needs to be reevaluated at every grid point , while @xmath55 needs only to be evaluated one time .",
    "once the values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 are specified , the log likelihood ratio @xmath58 is maximized with respect to @xmath37 , where @xmath59 .",
    "this process is repeated for each position @xmath30 on the grid . for most locations ,",
    "@xmath47 is zero , but local maxima will occur in the vicinity of one or more events . note that while the method is in some sense binned due to the discrete array of grid points , the spacing is chosen small enough so that errors introduced by binning are insignificant .",
    "the procedure described above is applied to the combined data set of 57 agasa events and 27 hires stereo events above @xmath0ev .",
    "the analysis is restricted to the agasa field of view with @xmath60 , and all but one hires event fall into this declination range .",
    "the background expectations for hires and agasa are different .",
    "the hires exposure has some dependence on right ascension .",
    "fig.[background ] shows the normalized hires and agasa background map in equatorial coordinates .    for the signal probability density function ( q ) of the hires events",
    ", we use a two - dimensional gaussian function whose width is chosen such that @xmath61 of the probability density function falls within an opening angle @xmath62 . note that for a two - dimensional gaussian distribution the opening angle @xmath63 encloses @xmath61 of the distribution . since the dependence on energy is weak",
    ", we use the same value , @xmath64 , for every hires stereo event .    for agasa , we approximate the probability density by the sum of two gaussian functions chosen such that the @xmath61 and @xmath65 opening angle given in  @xcite is correctly reproduced , @xmath66 the width of the gaussians as a function of energy has the same energy dependence used in  @xcite , and is given by @xmath67 more detailed information on the error shape of individual agasa events could easily be implemented if it becomes available .",
    "fig.[skymap_40 ] shows the result of the analysis . at each @xmath52 and @xmath53 ,",
    "the likelihood ratio is shown for the number of source events @xmath3 which maximizes @xmath47 .",
    "one can clearly recognize where events are located , and one can also recognize locations with several nearby events .",
    "agasa and hires events can easily be distinguished , as the latter have better resolution and therefore smaller regions with large likelihood .",
    "the point with the largest @xmath47 is at right ascension @xmath68 and declination @xmath69 .",
    "the corresponding event cluster comprises 3 nearby agasa events with coordinates @xmath70 and energies @xmath71 of ( 1 ) @xmath72 , @xmath73eev , ( 2 ) @xmath74 , @xmath75eev , and ( 3 ) @xmath76 , @xmath77eev .",
    "this cluster has been described in  @xcite and is listed as cluster c2 in  @xcite .",
    "the maximum likelihood ratio at this position is @xmath78 for @xmath79 .    the behavior of @xmath47 as a function of the fit parameters ( number of source events and position of the source ) in the vicinity of the maximum gives error estimates for the fit parameters . to a good approximation ,",
    "the @xmath80 error is given by the interval over which @xmath47 drops by 0.5 from its maximum value .",
    "fig.[lnr_vs_n_40 ] shows @xmath47 as a function of the number of source events at the position of the maximum .",
    "the best estimate of the number of source events is @xmath81 .",
    "similarly we find @xmath82 and @xmath83 as the best estimate for the position of the maximum .",
    "the statistical significance of the appearance of a `` source '' with a maximum likelihood ratio @xmath47 in the combined agasa / hires data set can be evaluated using simulated random data sets .",
    "the full likelihood analysis is performed for @xmath84 random data sets with the same number of agasa / hires events and the same underlying exposure as the original data set , but isotropic arrival directions .",
    "the chance probability for the `` source '' to appear is then given by the fraction of random data sets which have at least one location causing the maximum @xmath47 to be equal or larger than @xmath85 , the value of the maximum in the real data .",
    "fig.[lnr_40 ] shows the distribution of the maximum @xmath47 for each these random data sets . out of @xmath84",
    "simulated data sets , 2793 have a maximum @xmath47 exceeding that of the real data set .",
    "the chance probability of the source hypothesis is therefore of the order of @xmath86 .",
    "consequently , there is no statistically significant evidence for clustering consistent with a point source in the combined data set .",
    "note that this is _ not _ simply the chance probability for a triplet , but rather the chance probability for a set of 27 hires events and 57 agasa events to contain a `` hot spot '' with as high a probability to be a `` source '' as the triplet .",
    "many of the simulated likelihood ratios larger than 8.54 in fig.[lnr_40 ] are indeed caused by doublets .",
    "the maximum likelihood method is tested by applying it to simulated data sets with sources .",
    "these simulated data sets have @xmath87 events from a common source added to an otherwise isotropic arrival direction distribution . to create such a source",
    ", we pick a point in the sky for the source location and generate @xmath87 events with arrival directions deviating from the source location according to the probability density function of the individual event as described in section 2 .",
    "the source location is chosen at random , but the distribution of locations is forced to reflect the overall exposure of the detector ( fig.[background ] ) , so that regions with higher exposure are more likely to contain a source .",
    "the @xmath87 source events replace events in the data set , so the total number of events is always 83",
    ". there might be additional events close to the source location due to chance .",
    "the full likelihood analysis is applied to these random data sets .",
    "fig.[eff_40](top ) shows the maximum @xmath47 for @xmath84 random data sets where a source with @xmath88 ( blue line ) or @xmath89 ( red line ) has been added .",
    "fig.[eff_40](bottom ) shows the fraction of simulated data sets with maximum @xmath90 as a function of @xmath91 for random isotropic data sets with no source added ( @xmath92 , black line ) , a 4-event source added ( blue line ) , and a 3-event source added ( red line ) . while there is substantial overlap between the distributions , the plots also show that point sources which add three or more events to an isotropic map are recognized with high efficiency .",
    "the medians of the three maximum @xmath47-distributions ( @xmath93 ) are 7.7 , 11.6 and 16.0 , respectively .",
    "the hires and agasa events in the sample have rather different angular errors , and we expect this to be reflected in the likelihood ratio of the simulated data sets .",
    "the maximum @xmath47-distribution for clusters that are dominated by hires events should have a larger median than the data sets dominated by agasa events .",
    "fig.[median ] shows the median of the maximum @xmath47-distribution as a function of the number of hires events that contribute to the cluster . both for data sets with @xmath89 and @xmath88 , the median increases if more hires events are part of the cluster .",
    "artificial sources can also be used to test the accuracy with which the position of the point source is reconstructed .",
    "fig.[reso ] shows the difference between the fitted and the true right ascension @xmath52 and declination angle @xmath53 for @xmath89 and @xmath88 .",
    "the distributions are fit to a gaussian function , and the width , averaged over all source locations and combinations of agasa and hires source events , is of order @xmath94 to @xmath95 .",
    "the resolution improves with the number of events contributing to the signal , as expected .",
    "the chance probability of the triplet using agasa data alone has been estimated in  @xcite as being of order @xmath96 .",
    "this estimate is based on a fixed bin size of @xmath97 . to test what chance probability",
    "an unbinned analysis gives , we repeat the likelihood analysis for the data set comprising only the 57 agasa events above @xmath0ev .",
    "the largest likelihood ratio ( @xmath98 ) appears again near the events forming the triplet , with @xmath99 and @xmath100 for @xmath81 .    as before , we evaluate the chance probability for the appearance of a source with maximum @xmath98 or higher in this data set by analyzing a large number of simulated isotropic data set , now containing 57 agasa events .",
    "452 out of @xmath84 random data sets have a maximum @xmath47 in excess of 9.66 , so the chance probability is @xmath101 .",
    "the increase over the chance probability given in  @xcite reflects the fact that the unbinned maximum likelihood analysis evaluates the quality of the cluster on a continuum .",
    "this improves the sensitivity to a true point source , and at the same time it removes the artificial fluctuations that arise in a binned analysis when an event falls just inside or outside the bin .",
    "the maximum likelihood method allows a straightforward evaluation of the chance probability that a given cluster of events come from a common source rather than being caused by random background .",
    "it can also be used to estimate the chance probability that one or more pre - defined positions on the sky correlate with cosmic ray arrival directions . if several sources contribute , but none of them are strong enough to produce a notable value of @xmath47 , then the likelihood method described here has to be complemented by other methods , such as the angular two - point correlation function .",
    "searches for excess clustering have been performed using both the agasa and hires data sets separately , and for the combined set .",
    "no significant clustering is reported in the hires stereo  @xcite and monocular data sets  @xcite , and earlier reports that the agasa data set shows significant clustering  @xcite have recently been questioned .",
    "an unbiased analysis  @xcite which sets aside the fraction of the agasa data that was used to formulate the clustering hypothesis , finds that the clustering is consistent at the 8% level with the null hypothesis of isotropically distributed arrival directions .",
    "in addition , a two - point correlation analysis of the combined agasa and hires data sets finds no significant evidence for clustering  @xcite .",
    "the energy threshold of @xmath0ev chosen in this analysis is dictated by the fact that only agasa data above this threshold is published .",
    "it has been suggested ( e.g.  @xcite ) that the discrepancy in the measurement of the cosmic ray flux by agasa  @xcite and the monocular hires detector  @xcite can be reconciled to some degree by an _ ad hoc _ change of about @xmath102 in the relative energy scales of the experiments . in this scenario ,",
    "numerically equal energy thresholds in hires and agasa are not equivalent , and in order to compare the two data sets , one should either raise the nominal agasa threshold or lower the hires energy threshold , or apply a combination of both shifts .",
    "we do not speculate on the nature of the flux discrepancy here . at this point , there is no indication that it is caused by such a systematic shift in the energy scale of one or both of the experiments .",
    "we also note that lowering the energy threshold could potentially make magnetic bending a more serious limitation .",
    "however , since the possibility of an energy shift has been suggested by others , it is useful to evaluate whether the conclusions of the maximum likelihood analysis change under this assumption .",
    "therefore , the method is applied again to the data set combining the 57 agasa events above @xmath0ev and the 40 hires events above @xmath103ev , an energy threshold roughly @xmath102 lower .    lowering the hires energy cut admits an event that is near the aforementioned agasa triplet .",
    "this hires event has an energy of 37.6eev and is located at right ascension @xmath104 and declination @xmath105 .",
    "the location with the largest @xmath47 is close to this event , at @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "the maximum likelihood ratio is @xmath108 for @xmath109 .",
    "47 out of @xmath84 random isotropic data sets have a larger value of maximum @xmath47 .",
    "it is not possible to convert this number into a valid chance probability for the combination of the agasa triplet and the additional hires event because it contains several biases . while the maximum likelihood method removes the bias due to choosing an angular bin size",
    ", it does not remove the bias due to choosing an energy threshold .",
    "the agasa threshold of @xmath0ev was chosen in  @xcite precisely because it maximized the clustering signal in the early data set , a data set which comprises the first 30 of the 57 agasa events ( and two of the triplet events ) .",
    "an unbiased search for point sources using this energy threshold would require that these 30 events be set aside .",
    "further bias occurs because of the _ ad hoc _ lowering of the hires energy threshold .",
    "the best estimate for the position can be considered an _ a priori _ location for a point source search with statistically independent future data . to illustrate the sensitivity of a new data set to this hypothesis",
    ", simulations show that a simple binned analysis with a @xmath9 source bin radius centered on this location would give an unbiased chance probability of @xmath110 if 2 out of 40 future events fall into the source bin . in this calculation",
    ", it is assumed that the geometrical acceptance for the 40 new events is the same as for the original 40 events .",
    "hires is currently the only detector observing the cosmic ray sky in this energy range from the northern hemisphere .",
    "we anticipate several more years of data taking , and the search for cosmic ray point sources at the highest energies will continue when more data becomes available .",
    "the hires project is supported by the national science foundation under contract numbers nsf - phy-9321949 , nsf - phy-9322298 , nsf - phy-9974537 , nsf - phy-0098826 , nsf - phy-0245428 , by the department of energy grant fg03 - 92er40732 , and by the australian research council .",
