    "since the discovery of the quantum hall effect ( qhe )  @xcite , topological phenomena in quantum many - body systems have dramatically changed our understanding of phases of matter . in particular ,",

    "there has been a vast amount of recent effort to classify strongly - interacting spt phases  @xcite as well as to construct models supporting them  @xcite . in light of this effort , it is highly desirable to identify controlled mechanisms capable of bringing spt states into realization .    in this paper",
    ", we put forward a proposal to realize bosonic spt phases as out - of - equilibrium states of quantum spin systems with periodically - driven multispin interactions .",

    "however , it remains to be shown that the stroboscopic evolution generated by eq .",
    "yields telltale signatures of spt physics in local measurements . to address this point",
    ", we consider the local spin expectation value @xmath80 where @xmath81 is some initial state .",
    "this quantity coincides with the true time evolution of the operator @xmath82 in the limit @xmath43 , where the period @xmath83 is infinitesimally small and @xmath84 ( @xmath18 ) is approximately a continuous variable .",
    "for simplicity , we choose the initial state @xmath81 to be a product of eigenstates of @xmath85 on each site @xmath86 , so that @xmath87 is invariant under @xmath88 ( _ i.e. , _ the unitary transformation to the rotating frame ) .    the observable defined in eq .   provides a clear signature of the edge states in the sspt phase , even though the product state @xmath81 is a highly out - of - equilibrium state with respect to the stroboscopic hamiltonian ( c.f .  ref .",
    "@xcite ) . when @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 are independent of time , since @xmath64 and @xmath65 commute with the effective hamiltonian @xmath92 .",

    "fig : sigmaz](a ) ] .",
    "if @xmath26 is tuned slightly away from one of these special values but remains within the phase boundary , which amounts to adding a small transverse field @xmath95 , then the end spins precess in the @xmath96-@xmath97 plane on timescales much longer than @xmath94 , so that the bulk and boundary behavior can be distinguished . because the end spins were completely unconstrained before the addition of the transverse field",
    ", this precession , which is characteristic of a free spin placed in a magnetic field perpendicular to the quantization axis , manifests itself in oscillations of @xmath98 about zero [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : sigmaz](b ) ] . in this way",
    ", @xmath98 can be used to distinguish the free edge spins characteristic of spt physics from spins that are  frozen \" due to the presence of a symmetry - breaking field .",
    "for example , if a small longitudinal field @xmath99 is added to eq .  , thereby breaking the @xmath31 symmetry of the stroboscopic hamiltonian",
    ", then one finds that the end spins no longer wrap the unit circle in the @xmath96-@xmath97 plane as they precess when the transverse field is added at the ends of the chain .",
    "consequently , @xmath98 no longer oscillates around zero , but around a nonzero value whose sign matches the sign of the longitudinal field [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : sigmaz](c ) ] .",
    "thus , in the infinite - frequency limit , stroboscopic measurements of @xmath100 are an effective dynamical probe of spt physics at the boundary of the driven system .",
    "the preceding discussion is an accurate description of the driven system in the limit where the driving frequency @xmath9 is infinite .",

    "we now characterize the nature of these corrections ( _ c.f .",
    "_  ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and present arguments and numerical results showing that there is a window of time after the drive is switched on during which the signatures of the infinite - frequency sspt phase can be observed at large but finite driving frequencies .",
    "as the driving frequency @xmath9 is decreased , two effects occur that lead to deviations from the infinite - frequency case discussed in the previous section .",
    "first , the stroboscopic evolution of observables , as in eq .  , no longer coincides with the true time evolution of the system .",
    "in particular , expectation values of observables become dressed by intra - period effects that become significant if the system is not observed at stroboscopic times @xmath101 for @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "however , the expectation values of observables at stroboscopic times are still predicted by the unitary evolution generated by the floquet hamiltonian @xmath20 . for instance , the stroboscopic evolution of @xmath82 , which is given at infinite driving frequency by eq .  , becomes    @xmath102    where @xmath103 contains all finite - frequency corrections @xmath104 to the infinite - frequency floquet hamiltonian @xmath105 .",
    "this brings us to the second effect , namely the fact that @xmath20 acquires finite - frequency corrections appearing at orders @xmath106 and higher in the magnus expansion .",
    "these corrections generically break the symmetry that protects the sspt phase . indeed , in appendix a , we present the leading finite - frequency correction to the infinite - frequency hamiltonian @xmath107 that break the emergent @xmath31 symmetry down to the @xmath52 symmetry of the original time - dependent hamiltonian",
    ". we will now argue that these symmetry - breaking corrections are unimportant for the detection of the stroboscopic signatures of the sspt phase discussed in the previous section , provided that the driving frequency @xmath9 is sufficiently large compared to the bare transverse field energy scale @xmath108 .    to see this ,",
    "observe that at some stroboscopic time @xmath109 , the @xmath110-th order magnus correction is only important if @xmath111 is comparable in size ( modulo @xmath112 ) to a number of order one .",

    "[ fig : sigmaz](a ) ] , the envelope timescale also manifests itself in oscillations of the previously - frozen end spins due to the appearance of symmetry - breaking finite - frequency corrections at long times .",

    "[ fig : exact_dynamics](b ) , where the frequency has been lowered to @xmath123 .    to summarize this discussion ,",
    "we have argued in this section that the dynamical signatures of the sspt phase discussed in the previous section are immune to finite - frequency corrections for a window of time whose size increases monotonically with the driving frequency and approaches infinity in the infinite - frequency limit . at high but still reasonable frequencies @xmath124 , this time window is sufficiently large to extract these dynamical signatures before the corrections begin to take over .",
    "the rationale behind the ability to engineer the sspt hamiltonian  ( [ eq : finite chain ] ) can be stated as follows .",
    "first , recall that , when the driving vanishes , the mapping from the trivial phase to the spt one can be achieved via a product of local unitary transformations  @xcite . in the @xmath29 case ,",
    "the generator of this transformation is proportional to the ising interaction in eq .",
    "( [ eq : 1d hamiltonian in the lab frame ] )  @xcite . on the other hand , in the driven system",
    ", the unitary transformation @xmath125 to the rotating frame is also generated by the ising interaction .",
    "consequently , at infinite frequency , we found parameter regimes in which this transformation effectively mapped a trivial paramagnet to an spt one , and gave rise to an emergent @xmath29 symmetry that is not shared by the time - dependent hamiltonian  ( [ eq : 1d hamiltonian in the lab frame ] ) .",
    "the above discussion suggests a principle for obtaining an sspt phase in a periodically - driven system : the interaction term in eq .",
    "should be chosen to be the generator of the unitary transformation connecting a trivial to an spt system . in order to demonstrate that this stroboscopic approach to spt phases applies beyond the 1d case discussed above",
    ", we consider a 2d system on the triangular lattice with a driven three - spin interaction , @xmath126 where the summation in the second term runs over all the triangles of the lattice and we assume the same form for @xmath127 as in eq .  .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath128 and @xmath129 , we find that ( see appendix b ) @xmath130 remarkably , the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : floquet spt hamiltonian in 2d ] ) , which involves up to seven - spin interactions , is the exactly - solvable model of a @xmath30 spt paramagnet studied by levin and gu in ref .",
    "the model  ( [ eq : floquet spt hamiltonian in 2d ] ) can be obtained from a trivial paramagnet by a product of local unitary transformations that each depend on three @xmath131 spins ( see appendix b ) , which then justifies the need for a three - spin interaction in  ( [ eq : 2d driven hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "we close by commenting on possible experimental realizations of sspt phases .",
    "recent developments in quantum simulation with trapped ions  @xcite and superconducting quantum circuits  @xcite have shown that it is possible to engineer tunable multi - spin interactions and transverse fields in a laboratory setting .",
    "these developments suggest the possibility that sspt phases like the ones discussed in this paper could be realized in an experiment , if the appropriate sinusoidal drive can be implemented . the superconducting quantum circuit architecture described in ref .",
    "@xcite appears particularly well - suited to these purposes , as it was demonstrated in that work that the couplings between the superconducting qubits in that system can be tuned dynamically .",
    "the periodic modulation of the interaction strength required by our proposal is already feasible in that setup , making it an ideal candidate for a possible experimental realization .",
    "a thorough assessment of the suitability of this proposal for the experimental platforms mentioned above is necessary , but beyond the scope of this work .    to summarize ,",
    "we have shown in this work that , by adding appropriately chosen periodically - driven multispin interactions to a trivial paramagnetic hamiltonian , it is possible to realize spt phases in the high - frequency limit .",
    "we further illustrated via a 1d example that the spt phase can be probed with stroboscopic measurements of local observables .",
    "we also characterized numerically ( and analytically , in the appendices ) the finite - frequency corrections to the pure infinite - frequency sspt hamiltonian , and found that driving frequencies of order a hundred times the characteristic bare energy scale of the problem are sufficient to observe signatures of the phase .",
