    "although the lack of evidence for shocked companion stars of the progenitor co wds , shocked presupernova winds or companion pre  explosion images is more generally consistent with dd scenarios @xcite , there are different results that suggest the presence of circumstellar material ( csm ) around sn ia progenitors , which is generally expected in sd scenarios ( or slow dd mergers , see * ? ? ?",
    "these consist of optical colors that favor scattering in nearby material @xcite , narrow absorption lines that show variability @xcite , are blueshifted @xcite , or that correlate with certain sn ejecta viewing angles @xcite .",

    "this division of the sample is based on finding the lira law @xmath0 decline rate that maximizes the differences between fast and slow lira law @xmath0 decliners ( explained in more detail in section  [ sec : stability ] ) and it implies that 33% of the sne in the sample are defined as fast lira law @xmath0 decliners .    in order to study the effect of positron absorption",
    ", we investigate whether the differences between fast and slow @xmath0 lira law decliners are related to their bolometric decline rates during the lira law , which we approximate by their @xmath10band decline rates .",

    "however , we find a significant difference between their distributions of @xmath9band decline rates , with a ks test probability of only 0.0001 that their distributions of @xmath9band decline rates arise from the same parent population .",
    "thus , the lira law @xmath0 decline rate diversity is driven primarily by different @xmath9band decline rates , in the direction that fast lira law @xmath0 decliners are slow lira law @xmath9 decliners  band decline rate directly after maximum , which is connected to different stretch or @xmath12 values ] .",
    "the fact that the lira law @xmath0 decline rate is connected to the presence of narrow absorption features suggests that this effect is either caused by younger progenitor systems having slower lira law @xmath9 decline rates , which would be associated with star forming regions and larger gas / dust column densities ; or to the presence of circumstellar material that causes the @xmath9 band evolution to become slower at late times .",
    "we show the @xmath9 and @xmath10 band decline rates vs the @xmath0 decline rates in figure  [ fig : declines ] .",
    "if faster lira law @xmath0 decliners are associated with more material in the line of sight , we should also expect a difference in the distributions of colors around maximum light of fast and slow lira decliners .",
    "in fact , the distributions of @xmath0 colors at maximum obtained with sifto and @xmath13 extinctions obtained from snoopy are significantly different if we divide the sample between fast and slow lira law @xmath0 decliners , with @xmath14values of 0.0004 and 0.0001 , respectively .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : bbvcolormax ] .",
    "fast and slow lira law @xmath0 decliners also differ significantly in their colors 55 days after maximum ( @xmath14value of 0.003 ) .",
    "it should be noted that fast and slow lira law @xmath0 decliners tend to have more similar colors at late times during the lira law , as redder sne in @xmath0 tend to decrease faster in @xmath0 .",

    "in order to do this we divide our sample by quantities that should favor higher ism column densities , such as host galaxy morphological type or host galaxy inclinations ( removing e / s0s from the sample , where it is difficult to define an inclination ) .",
    "if there was a strong preference for morphological type among different lira law @xmath0 decline rates it could mean that younger systems decay faster during the lira law , and that there is no need to invoke csm as an explanation .",
    "if there was a strong preference for galaxy inclination , it would suggest that the lira law @xmath0 decline rate is affected by ism in the line of sight .",
    "stretch and @xmath12 are also thought to be associated with the age of the progenitor systems @xcite , which we also confirmed in our sample , with @xmath14values of less than @xmath15 for the null hypothesis that the distributions of stretch and @xmath12 dividing the sample between earlier and later type hosts arise from the same parent population .",
    "thus , stretch and @xmath12 play a similar role as the host galaxy morphological type in the sense that younger systems ( larger stretch or smaller @xmath12 ) occur in regions where the ism column density should be larger .",
    "therefore , if stretch or @xmath5 were connected to the evolution of @xmath0 at late times it could suggest that environment could drive the different lira law @xmath0 decline rates . on the other hand , stretch and @xmath12 are known to account for most of the diversity of sn ia light curves because they are likely related to the enclosed mass of @xmath7ni or iron group elements ( ige ) in the ejecta , which is the power source of sn ia light curves . considering that at late times the physics of the decay of @xmath7co and the absorption of positrons start to become more relevant , it is not unreasonable to think that both stretch and @xmath12 could be related to the lira law @xmath0 decline rate .",
    "thus , we test whether the distributions of host morphological type , host inclination , stretch and @xmath12 of fast and slow lira law @xmath0 decliners arise from the same parent population . in none of the tests we obtained strongly significant differences ( see table  [ tab : host ] ) . therefore",
    ", assuming that the lira law @xmath0 decline rate is not strongly affected by the amount of ism in the line of sight , we interpret the results shown in table  [ tab : results ] as evidence for csm around those sne ia having the fastest lira law @xmath0 decline rates ( but see section  [ sec : ism ] ) .    the presence of csm could easily change the slope of the lira law @xmath0 decline rate , either by multiple scattering processes ( i.e. csm light echoes , see * ? ? ? * ) or by the progressive destruction of nearby dust if the material is sufficiently close to the expanding ejecta , making the @xmath0 colors increasingly bluer at late times and , as a consequence , the lira law @xmath0 decline rates faster .",

    "in fact , we can not rule out that the the distributions of colors at maximum in the earlier and later type hosts  or lower and higher inclination hosts  arise from the same parent population ( @xmath14values of 0.16 and 0.39 , respectively ) , as also found in previous studies ( see e.g. @xcite , c.f .",
    "this would be expected if the colors of sn ia at maximum were primarily driven by ism .",
    "however , we do rule out that the distributions of colors 55 days after maximum in earlier and later type hosts arise from the same parent population ( @xmath14value of 0.003 ) .",
    "this suggests that : 1 ) @xmath0 colors at maximum and 55 days after maximum are driven by different physical effects , and 2 ) @xmath0 colors 55 days after maximum are more related to the properties of the environment where sne occur .",

    "in fact , we detect a highly significant increase on the equivalent widths of na i d1 & d2 due to ism related properties by performing ks tests on the distribution of ews of na i d1 & d2 dividing a bigger sample by host galaxy type , host galaxy inclination , stretch or @xmath12 instead of by lira law @xmath0 decline rate , with @xmath14values smaller than 0.00001 in all cases .",
    "a prediction from @xcite is that those sne ia with more csm should have a steeper reddening law towards the blue .",
    "thus , we expect that fast lira law @xmath0 decliners should have a lower @xmath1 at maximum light if csm was present in these systems , which can be measured using @xmath4 colors . in figure",
    "[ fig : rvs ] we show the @xmath4 vs @xmath0 colors at maximum and 55 days after maximum with best  fitting @xmath18 values assuming the reddening law of @xcite and @xcite . to estimate the @xmath1 best  fitting errors we have done a montecarlo analysis based on the measured @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath19 magnitudes and their errors .",
    "we created 1000 realizations of these magnitudes at maximum and 55 days after maximum to derive @xmath0 and @xmath4 colors , which by definition are correlated , and then derive 1000 best  fitting @xmath20 values , whose standard deviation was used as the error .",
    "we find that fast lira law decliners have a steeper reddening law ( lower @xmath1 ) than slow lira law decliners , a result that becomes more pronounced at maximum light , even after removing the highly reddened sn 2003cg and sn 2006x .",
    "in fact , the @xmath18 values that best match the data for fast and slow lira law decliners are @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively , which is consistent with what has been found for highly reddened and normal sne ia @xcite . at 55 days after maximum",
    "we find that the reddening laws of fast and slow lira law decliners are significantly different , but more similar to each other than at maximum light , with @xmath23 and @xmath24 for fast and slow lira law @xmath0 decliners , respectively .",
    "these results are consistent with a contribution from light echoes and/or csm dust destruction at late times , which would make the @xmath0 colors bluer .",
    "however , we can not rule out an intrinsic relation between @xmath4 and @xmath0 colors at maximum light and at late times that could mimic some of our results , although this relation would need to be different for fast and slow lira law @xmath0 decliners .",
    "we have also studied the @xmath4 colors at maximum and 55 days after maximum of the sne in the sample , in a similar fashion to @xmath0 colors .",
    "the probabilities that the distributions of @xmath4 colors at maximum light or 55 days after maximum of fast and slow lira law @xmath0 decliners arise from the same parent population is 0.13 and 0.07 , respectively .",

    "in order to test whether the time interval used for measuring the lira law @xmath0 decline rate ( 35 to 80 days after maximum ) affects our conclusions , we have repeated the relevant tests using data from different time intervals after maximum .",
    "later time photometry could have larger measurement errors and could therefore affect our best fitting decline rates . also , the choice of the start of the lira law regime is important since it could be too close to the observed peak in color evolution .",

    "we found that there is a probability of 0.07 that the distributions of lira law @xmath0 decline rates of sne ia with si ii velocities faster or slower than 11,800 [ km s@xmath11 ] arise from the same parent population , a probability of 0.002 that the distributions of colors at maximum of fast and slow si ii velocity sne ia arise from the same parent population , a probability of 0.81 that the distributions of equivalent widths of narrow na absorption of fast and slow si ii velocity sne ia arise from the same parent population and a probability of 0.07 that the distributions of morphological types of fast and slow si ii velocity sne ia arise from the same parent population .",
    "this confirms the color differences found by @xcite and suggests a further connection with lira law @xmath0 decline rates .",
    "the non  detection of significant differences in the distribution of equivalent widths of na absorption or morphological type with si ii velocity may indicate that some of these color differences are intrinsic , or that our sample size is not large enough , given the recent finding by @xcite of different radial distributions for fast and slow si ii velocity sne ia .",
    "although the previous tests suggest that environmental factors do not contribute to the lira law @xmath0 decline rate , it is intriguing that in figure  [ fig : pvalues ] the region where the @xmath14values associated with tests for a relation between lira law decline rates and the host galaxy morphological type or inclination are lowest coincides with the region where @xmath14values associated with equivalent widths or colors are also the lowest .",
    "this led to us to consider whether the ism could really affect the lira law @xmath0 decline rate in some way .",
    "since the inclination of a galaxy should not be related to the presence or absence of csm in sne ia , and given that the ism will be generally too distant from the sn explosion to produce significant light echoes or to be destroyed by the expanding ejecta between 35 and 80 days after maximum , a different mechanism to produce changes in the lira law @xmath0 decline rate would be needed .",
    "note that we are not referring to ism light echoes @xcite , which can affect the light curves at even later times than those considered in this work .",
    "in fact , the transversal expansion of the ejecta in an inhomogeneous distribution of projected column densities of the host galaxy ism could affect the lira law @xmath0 decline rate by changing the average column density as the photospheric radius increases .",
    "if this is the case , what needs to be shown is whether systems that have stronger na i d1 & d2 absorption and redder colors at maximum are also expected to have faster lira law @xmath0 decline rates due to this effect .    for this",
    ", we follow the approach of to study the effect of the transversal expansion of the ejecta in a non  homogeneous ism . assuming their approximation for the evolution of the sn photospheric radius with time , and using random realizations of the ism column density assuming a fractal structure with power law of -2.75 on spatial scales down to the size of the photosphere",
    ", we compute the average column density within the photospheric radius as the sn expands . in figure  [",
    "fig : ism ] , left , we show one realization of the dust column density with different photospheric radii shown as the sn expands . in this example , because the sn started behind a relatively over  dense region , the average column density started at a relatively large value and tended to decrease with time due to a dilution effect as the photospheric radius increases . in figure  [ fig : ism ] , right , we show the expected evolution of the average column density for one thousand ism realizations , showing different percentiles for reference .",
    "this figure shows that the biggest dispersion occurs at early times , when chance alignments with under or over  dense regions can dominate , but the dilution effect occurring at later times will make the dispersion of the average column densities decrease .",
    "thus , figure  [ fig : ism ] shows that the inhomogeneous nature of the ism will naturally produce sne ia that have stronger equivalent widths of narrow blended na i d1 & d2 absorption and are redder at maximum , and that have fast  evolving average column densities , and therefore faster lira law @xmath0 decline rates .",
    "the higher the inclination , the stronger the effect as the typical column density will tend to increase .",
    "moreover , at later times the colors will be dominated by the overall column density , which could explain why sne ia in later morphological types are significantly redder at later times . however",
    ", this effect would not explain the differences in reddening laws observed between fast and slow lira law @xmath0 decliners .",
    "nonetheless , the column density is expected to be proportional to the product of the color excess and @xmath18 , and a detailed analysis of figure  [ fig : ism ] implies that at maximum light the @xmath0 colors of the sne in the percentiles 50 and 95 should differ by about 0.25 mag assuming @xmath31 , @xmath32 units and @xmath33 units . ] , or by about 0.12 mag for the percentiles 30 and 70 . at 55 days after maximum",
    ", the @xmath0 colors of the sne in the percentiles 50 and 95 should differ by about 0.15 mag , and by about 0.08 for the percentiles 30 and 70 .",
    "these magnitude differences are of the same order as those seen in figure  [ fig : bvsample ] , but are not consistent with the lack of correlation between the lira law @xmath10band and @xmath0 decline rates observed in figure  [ fig : declines]b .",
    "this suggests that the inhomogeneous nature of the ism can not explain all our findings , and that a more detailed analysis will be needed to exclude this possibility .",
    "in this work we have shown that there are significant differences in the @xmath0 evolution of sne ia during the lira law regime , between 35 and 80 days after maximum .",
    "these differences are driven by the evolution of sne ia in the @xmath9band : fast lira law @xmath0 decliners are slow lira law @xmath9 decliners . with the sample defined in section  [ sec : sample ] we have shown that fast lira law @xmath0 decliners , defined as having lira law @xmath0 decline rates smaller than -0.013 mag day@xmath11 , have stronger narrow absorption lines of blended na i d1 & d2 , are redder and have a a lower @xmath1 extinction law at maximum light and 55 days after maximum light .",
    "the differences in colors were stronger at maximum light .",
    "additionally , we did not find a highly significant difference between the distributions of host galaxy morphological type , host galaxy inclination , stretch or @xmath12 dividing the sample by lira law @xmath0 decline rate .",
    "this suggests that the lira law @xmath0 decline rates are not strongly dependent on the age of the sn ia progenitor systems , are not strongly affected by ism , and are not mainly driven by the the mass of nickel in the ejecta , the main parameter of sn ia light curves .    for the sample of 89 sne ia that had good photometric coverage up to late times",
    ", we found that their colors at maximum were consistent between earlier and later type galaxies . the colors 55 days after maximum were significantly different between earlier and later type galaxies , suggesting that the extinction at later times is more clearly connected to ism and that late time colors may be a better proxy for environment .",
    "if csm is dominant at early times , the cancelling effect on the color excess due to csm light echoes or to dust destruction as the ejecta sweeps over the csm could explain this result .",
    "a sn explosion surrounded by csm should sublimate dust and ionize na i up to some maximum radii , therefore the csm should have a characteristic minimum radius , @xmath34 , which is thought to be between 0.01 and 0.1 pc for na i @xcite , and which is expected to be of the same order of magnitude for dust @xcite .",
    "photons leaving the ejecta at maximum light could be seen as light echoes 55 days after maximum if they are reflected after traveling for about 55 days , or a typical distance of about 0.05 pc , which is of the order of this minimum csm radius .",
    "however , light echoes are not the only mechanism that can produce this effect : depending on the outer ejecta speed , which we assume to be one tenth of the speed of light , the ejecta could have traveled up to about 0.001 pc at maximum light ; therefore it should not have time to interact with the csm and sublimate csm dust .",
    "however , 55 days after maximum light the ejecta could be approaching the inner edge of the csm , since it will have traveled up to about 0.006 pc , and it could start reducing the dust column density .",
    "this could explain why the differences in colors and extinction laws found at maximum light between fast and slow lira law decliners were not as strong 55 days after maximum , but also why environmental effects explain some of the differences in colors 55 days after maximum .",
    "it is interesting to note that smaller dust sublimation or na i d1 & d2 ionization csm radii should produce more extinction and stronger narrow absorption features , which we find in fast lira law @xmath0 declining sne ia . for the same ejection velocity and mass loss rate before a supernova explosion , the dust column density and extinction should scale as @xmath35 .",
    "smaller csm dust inner radii should also produce stronger csm light echoes , since their intensity should scale as @xmath36 , which would be reflected in faster @xmath0 evolution at late times because of the slower expected lira law @xmath9band decline rates . in fact , @xcite showed that smaller csm radii should affect more significantly the @xmath0 evolution at later times , producing faster lira law @xmath0 decline rates .",
    "the resulting fast declining sample is composed of 29 sne ia ( 33% ) and the slow declining sample , by 60 sne ia ( 67% ) .",
    "interestingly , the fraction of fast lira decliners is similar to the fraction of 35% high velocity sne ia ( hv sne ia , with @xmath37 [ km s@xmath11 ] ) among the group of normal sne ia found by @xcite , or the excess of about 25% of sne ia with blueshifted absorption features detected by @xcite , which is also consistent with the excess of blueshifted systems among hv sne ia found by @xcite .",
    "this suggests that blueshifted narrow absorption features , high velocity si ii features at maximum , high equivalent widths of narrow absorption features , redder colors at maximum , fast lira law decline rates and lower @xmath38 reddening laws may all be associated with the same population , which in our interpretation is the one with significant csm .",
    "unfortunately , there is no overlap between our sample and the recent sample of csm  interacting sne ia found by @xcite .",
    "the overlap between our sample and that from @xcite is very small ( only 4 sne ) and we can not test whether their blueshifted sample corresponds to our fast declining sample .",
    "however , the two overlapping sne ia in their blueshifted sample are also fast lira law @xmath0 decliners in our sample , sn 2006x and sn 2007le , and they also happen to have variable na",
    "i d1 & d2 narrow absorption features @xcite , which is expected in the csm interpretation .    in the context of fg12 , we have found a weak correlation between nebular velocity shifts ( @xmath26 ) and lira law @xmath0 decline rates , which is consistent with the interpretation of fg12 , but which needs to be confirmed with a bigger sample .",
    "this would mean that sne ia with @xmath39 have stronger equivalent widths of na i d1 & d2 , are redder at maximum light , have faster lira law @xmath0 decline rates and have lower @xmath1 reddening laws at maximum light because they have more csm in their line of sight .",
    "assuming that about 33% of the sne ia have significant csm in the line sight and that @xmath26 is a good proxy for explosion viewing angle , this would mean that there is a comparable population of sne ia with negative nebular velocities that would also have significant csm , but which we do not see in narrow absorption features or fast lira law @xmath0 decline rates because their csm is on the opposite side of their ejecta . here it should be noted that dust scattering is primarily forward scattering @xcite , which means that light echoes would be best seen when the csm is between the sne and the observer ( @xmath40 in fg12 ) .",
    "although the fractions are uncertain at the moment , this leaves room for additional progenitor scenarios that do not fit in this csm picture .    since changes in the lira law decline rate could be easily produced by csm ( * ?",
    "* see their figure 8) , and given that we did not find any significant environmental dependency of the lira law @xmath0 decline rates , we propose that the differences found between fast and slow lira law @xmath0 decliners are due to csm , but we also investigate the possibility that a similar result could be produced by ism .",
    "we showed that the transversal expansion of the sn photosphere within an inhomogeneous distribution of column densities could naturally lead to faster lira law decliners having stronger absorption at maximum as discussed in section  [ sec : ism ] , but further modeling is required to exclude this possibility .",
    "this work is an addition to the growing evidence for csm in sne ia , but we believe that only the use of high resolution spectra @xcite will help better constrain the nature of the absorbing material in sne ia . the lack of evidence for shocked winds , shocked companion stars , companion stars in pre  supernova images or companion stars in sn",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may indicate that the progenitors of sne ia arise from more than one progenitor scenario or from more complicated scenarios that we have not yet imagined .    finally , although it is still possible that the physics of positron absorption could be responsible for the variations of the lira law detected ,",
    "this effect should depend on the age of the progenitors in order to produce stronger narrow absorption features due to larger ism column densities .",
    "the fact that we do not find a strong dependency between lira law decline rates and environment , stretch or @xmath5 suggests that this is not the case .",
    "additional studies of the relation between very late @xmath0 decline rates ( e.g. beyond 200 days ) and the lira law @xmath0 decline rate could be used to provide a clean separation between the effects of csm and the physics of positron absorption ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
