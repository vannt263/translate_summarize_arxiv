    "* ) observations of t tauri stars have provided strong evidence of dust evolution , particularly in the well surveyed @xmath11 - 2 myr old taurus - auriga star - forming region @xcite .",
    "the most notable evidence of dust evolution lies in the observations of transitional disks .",
    "these disks have characteristics that fall between those objects that have clear evidence for disks and those objects with no disk material ; the seds point to radial gaps in the disk .",
    "all transitional disks have a significant deficit of flux in the near - ir which has been explained by modeling the disks with truncated optically thick disks @xcite .",
    "coku tau@xmath44 is one of these transitional disks in taurus @xcite .",
    "the sed of this object is photospheric below 8 and rises at longer wavelengths , showing weak silicate emission at 10 ; this can be explained by the emission of the frontally illuminated edge or  wall \" of an outer disk truncated at 10 au from the star @xcite and the weak silicate emission arises in the atmosphere of the wall .",
    "there are no small grains in the inner disk , in agreement with coku tau@xmath44 s classification as a non - accreting , weak t tauri star .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations indicate that this gap may be due to the formation of a planet @xcite .",
    "other studies point to photoevaporation of the disk by the star @xcite .",
    "similar to coku tau@xmath44 , dm tau has been modeled with an inner disk region free of small dust and a truncated optically thick disk at 3 au ( * ? ? ?",
    "however , this star is still accreting , indicating that gas should still remain in the inner disk region .",
    "gm aur , which is also accreting , was modeled by c05 with an optically thick disk truncated at 24 au and a small amount of dust in the inner disk which leads to its observed near - ir excess .",
    "this disk gap could also be due to a planet @xcite .",
    "tw hya , a transitional disk in the @xmath110 myr old tw hya association @xcite , has an outer optically thick disk with a 4 au hole filled with an inner optically thin region populated by a small amount of dust @xcite .",
    "not only has @xmath0 been a powerful tool in exploring the dust evolution in circumstellar disks , it also has the potential to access new probes of the gas evolution in these disks , an area of study which is still in its infancy and largely uncertain .",
    "high - resolution molecular spectroscopy has permitted us to access abundant molecular tracers within the inner disk such as h@xmath14 and co @xcite .",

    "see table 1 for the wall s location ( r@xmath54 ) , maximum grain size ( a@xmath55 ) , and other parameters .",
    "the emission at 10 comes from the optically thin inner region ( c05 ) which extends up to 1 au from the star and has a minimum grain size of 1.9 and a maximum grain size of 2.1 ( figure  [ figmodel ] ) .",

    "the disk surface is both ionized and heated by stellar x - rays . ne ions ( primarily ne@xmath65 and ne@xmath66 )",
    "are produced through x - ray ionization and destroyed by charge exchange with atomic hydrogen and radiative recombination .",
    "alternatively , hollenbach & gorti ( in prep ) propose that euv photons from the stellar chromosphere and/or stellar accretion can create an ionized hii - region - like layer at the disk surface that can also produce significant [ ne ii ] emission .",
    "cs cha shows clear evidence of advanced dust evolution in relation to other transitional disks : it has significant grain growth and substantial settling in its outer disk .",
    "the dust in the wall of the outer disk in cs cha has grown to much larger sizes ( 5 ) than the dust in the transitional disks coku tau@xmath44 , dm tau , gm aur , and tw hya , all of which have maximum grain sizes in the outer wall of 0.25 @xcite , and cs cha has large grains in the inner optically thin region as well , similar to tw hya @xcite .",
    "cs cha also needs more settling in the outer disk ( @xmath38 = 0.01 ) to fit the far - infrared and mm data , indicating much higher dust depletion in the upper layers than found in gm aur and dm tau , which were modeled with @xmath38 = 0.1 ( c05 ) .",
    "in addition , cs cha further stands out due to its large hole size , having the largest modeled to date at @xmath1 43 au .",
    "this large inner hole serves to decrease the mid - infrared dust continuum and hence increase the line to continuum ratio , facilitating the detection of [ ne ii ] fine - structure emission .",

    "the luminosity seen in dm tau is 1.3 @xmath2 10@xmath67 ergs s@xmath6 and for gm aur the 5 @xmath68 upper limit is 7.4 @xmath2 10@xmath67 ergs s@xmath6 ( measured from spectra in c05 ) .",
