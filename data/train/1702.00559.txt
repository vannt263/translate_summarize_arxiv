    "the appearance of single - molecule micromanipulation methods  @xcite made it possible to investigate biological macromolecules , considering it as a separate system .",
    "these methods use optical tweezers  @xcite , microneedles  @xcite , atomic force microscopes  @xcite .",
    "single - molecule micromanipulation methods allow to study processes such as dna stretching , bending , twisting  @xcite and the dna double helix nucleic base pairs opening  @xcite . among them especially important",
    "is the process of sequential separation of nucleic bases in dna base pairs under the action of external forces ( dna unzipping ) , which plays a key role in the genetic information transferring process .    at the early studies separation of bases in dna",
    "double helix nucleic pairs ( @xmath1 ) was identified as the process of denaturation of macromolecules under the temperature influence . this process is called dna melting  @xcite . in this case",
    "the process of base pairs opening is not sequential and the denaturation takes place in dna sites which have different size and location .",
    "firstly base pairs in at - rich sites open , and then - in gc - rich sites . in contrast to the melting process , single - molecule micromanipulation methods make it possible to investigate the process of sequential opening of dna base pairs in the same way as it takes place in cell _ in vivo_.    in the physical experiment of the unzipping process , which is carried out by the single - molecule micromanipulation methods , the dependence of the opening force on the opening distance is measured  @xcite . for @xmath2-phage dna at small pulling velocities ( @xmath3 ) the strand separation starts to take place after reaching by the force of a some critical value ( @xmath4 ) . for this force value two consequent plateaus at @xmath5 and @xmath6 are observed and force peaks @xmath7 in the plateau area occur ( sawtooth nature of the dna unzipping process )  @xcite . for big velocities ( @xmath8 )",
    "the plateau has a bigger value and hysteresis is observed  @xcite .",
    "the dna unzipping process has been studied theoretically  @xcite . by bockelmann",
    "@xcite a model of the unzipping process which takes into consideration the opening energies of base pairs and the elastic energies of single strands is proposed .",
    "the authors managed to obtain the critical force value of @xmath4 .",
    "the peaks occurrence in the plateau area is considered as a molecular stick - slip motion that takes place because of a heterogeneity of macromolecule . but this model does not describe the difference between two plateaus on the @xmath2-dna unzipping curve .",
    "probably , the mechanism of the unzipping process can differ from that described in the works  @xcite . in the present work",
    "it will be shown that the reason of its difference can be the base pair opening along different pathways .",
    "the different pathways of base pairs opening are studied in the paper  @xcite where two - component model describing the dna unzipping process is proposed . according to this model the dna unzipping process takes place due to the creation of conformational bistability in the system under the external force action . as a result the process of the base pairs opening flows cooperatively .",
    "the goal of the present work is to determine the physical processes that occur in dna macromolecule during the dna unzipping and to describe the experimental data on the qualitative and quantitative level . in sec.[exp_an ]",
    "the data from the single - molecule micromanipulation dna unzipping experiment is analyzed and some features of the opening force - distance dependence that have not been explained in the previous theoretical models are determined . in sec.[main ] using the atom - atom potential functions method at and gc base pairs separation energies along different pathways are estimated . as the result",
    "it is determined that during the unzipping process dna base pairs can open not only along the stretch pathway , but under some conditions they can firstly transit into a metastable state along the opening pathway , and then fully open along the stretch pathway .",
    "in the single - molecule micromanipulation experiments the @xmath9-phage dna double helix is studied  @xcite .",
    "it has a length of 48 502 bp .",
    "one end of one strand is attached to the substrate , and another strand from the same end - to the ball , which is held with a glass microneedle or optical trap .",
    "the scheme of the experiment is shown on fig.[fig : expsheme ] . from the other end double helix",
    "is not fixed and it forms a tertiary structure in the shape of a coil .",
    "ball is moved with a constant speed , thus consequently opening the double helix .",
    "than the dependence of the applied force on the displacement of the ball is measured .",
    "let us analyse the curve structure ( fig.[fig : expdepen ] ) obtained in the  @xcite . on the curve fragment b - c sharp increase of the force almost without changing of the distance is observed .",
    "this corresponds to the tension increase of the whole system until force reaches a certain critical value , which corresponds to the bases separation in dna nucleic pairs .    on the curve fragment c",
    "- d base pairs opening takes place .",
    "this fragment consists of two plateaus . in the first half of the double helix opening",
    "occurs on the average force value of @xmath5 , and in the second half on @xmath10 ( fig.[fig : expdepen ] ) . as seen",
    ", there are two different plateaus with a small difference in the critical force value .",
    "it is known that the first half of @xmath11-dna consists mainly of  gc pairs , while the second half is dominated by at pairs .",
    "therefore , the average opening force of the first half of @xmath2-dna will be close to the opening force of the gc pair , and in the second half - to the opening force of the at pair .",
    "so , the unzipping of these two parts of @xmath2-phage dna should take place under different opening force .",
    "really , as it is seen from the experiment the value of force difference is @xmath7 ( fig.[fig : expdepen ] ) .",
    "4.5pt [ tab : force_exp ]    .free opening energies of at and gc base pairs , calculated in the corresponding works , the difference between the opening forces of at and gc base pairs @xmath12 and the averange opening force @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14fitting parameters in  @xcite , @xmath15opening energies of at- and gc- containing polymers , averaged over the nearest neighbors  @xcite , @xmath16our estimations using ( [ for : op_force ] ) , @xmath17calculated in  @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "according to our estimations the mechanism which is proposed here describes the dna double helix unzipping process that can take place according to two different scenarios .    the first from them ( stretch after opening ) is connected with the base pair transition into the pre - opened metastable state along the opening pathway ( fig.[fig : scenario]b ) , the second is the direct extension of the hydrogen bonds along the stretch pathway ( fig.[fig : scenario]a ) .",
    "as the frequency of the bases vibrations in a pair along the opening pathway ( @xmath18 ) is lower than along the stretch pathway ( @xmath19 )  @xcite , in the first scenario bases in a pair need more time to separate and the first scenario is more probable to take place at low pulling velocities .",
    "it should be noted that the transition into metastable state can occur because of the structural changes of the dna site situated between the unzipping fork and the dsdna coil ( fig.[fig : expsheme ] ) . as the result of our estimations",
    "it is shown that the experimental difference between two plateaus on the force - distance curve of the @xmath2-dna unzipping with low pulling velocities is connected with the realization of the stretch after opening scenario .    in the works",
    "@xcite it is shown that the pre - opened metastable state can be formed with the participation of water molecules ( fig.[fig : atpair]b ) .",
    "it should be noted that our estimations for the difference in opening energies between at and gc pairs for stretch and stretch after opening scenarios ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) are also appropriate for transition from the state where water is integrated to the external hydrogen bond ( @xmath22@xmath23 for at ( fig.[fig : atpair ] ) and @xmath24@xmath25 for gc )  @xcite .",
    "this is because the contribution from interaction of atoms forming the outer hydrogen bond with a water molecule is the same for at and gc base pairs .",
    "further the process of base pairs opening along the stretch pathway can take place cooperatively .",
    "cooperativity can emerge because the energy difference for further opening between at and gc pairs ( @xmath21 ) is very smal ( tabl.[tab : finaltab ] , stretch after opening ) . about the cooperativity of the unzipping process in this scenario",
    "argues the smooth descent of peaks on the force - distance curve ( fig.[fig : expdepen ] ) as well .",
    "it is known that the unzipping fork is being blocked from time to time during the unzipping process that results in the peak occurrence on the force - distance curve  @xcite . in the present study",
    "it is shown that the reason of its blocking is the absence of the conditions of its propagation along the site situated between the fork and the dsdna coil .",
    "this conditions are created after base pair transition into the pre - opened state in this site .    at high pulling speeds ( @xmath26 )",
    "the process becomes to be non - equilibrium , about what argues the hysteresis occurrence on the force - distance curve  @xcite . in this case",
    "the rotational friction torque starts to play a significant role  @xcite and pairs do not have time to transit into the metastable state . in this case",
    "only the second scenario can take place when base pairs open along the stretch pathway which has much higher vibrational frequency than the opening pathway .",
    "the difference between the two plateaus on a force - distance dependence of the @xmath2-phage dna should be much bigger than in the first scenario ( tabl.[tab : finaltab ] ) .",
    "the unzipping of short dna hairpins can also take place according to this scenario because the values of the difference between opening forces of short poly - at and poly - gc hairpins ( sec.[exp_an ] ) and the @xmath27 ( tabl.[tab : finaltab ] ) are similar .    as it is seen from the experiment , in natural conditions the process takes place with small velocities ( @xmath28 )  @xcite .",
    "thus the stretch after opening scenario is more probable to take place during the real _ in vivo _ unzipping processes such as transcription and translation .",
