    "we extend the studies of @xcite and @xcite and follow the cosmological evolution of a milky way - like halo from high redshifts until z=0 .",
    "coupled to the star formation process , we inject small - scale dipole - shaped magnetic seed fields ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) given typical dimensions and magnetic field amplitudes found in canonical sn remnants .",
    "the seeding rate roughly corresponds to 10@xmath2 g / gyr .",
    "this is the only process of magnetic field seeding and we do not consider any other seeds as in many previous simulations ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "subsequently , the magnetic field strength increases exponentially on timescales of a few ten million years within the innermost regions of the halo .",
    "the amplification is due to dynamo action occurring during galaxy formation and at last , motions and turbulent diffusion carry the field towards the halo outskirts and magnetize the entire halo at z=0 .",
    "the simulations were run with the gadget @xcite code and the @xcite star formation prescription .",
    "figure [ sim_rm ] shows the intrinsic rm evolution of the innermost region of the halo and observational data taken from the literature .",
    "the @xmath3 is calculated as the line - of - sight integral of magnetic field and thermal electron density . in our simulations , at redshifts between z=4 and z=2 , high intrinsic rm values exceeding 1000 rad / m@xmath1 are due to high star formation rates and very efficient field amplification . as the halo virializes towards z=0 , the magnetic field diffuses and therefore the intrinsic rm values decline to 10 rad / m@xmath1 .",
    "at the moment , observational rm data at high redshifts is difficult to obtain and interpret .",
    "however , we think a careful comparison with existing data is already possible .",
    "these data shows both trends reproduced by our simulations for objects residing in the same environments and similar source sizes .",
    "galaxy formation at high redshifts undergoes extremely violent phases with excessive amounts of feedback",
    ". this could be the origin of the large intrinsic rm values see at that cosmic epoch .",
    "this work is supported by the dfg cluster of excellence universe , dfg research unit 1254 and by the magneticum project ( http://www.magneticum.org ) ."
