    "<S> a re - examination of the atmospheric cascade profile of the highest energy cosmic ray is presented . </S>",
    "<S> the study includes air - shower simulations considering different cross sections , particle multiplicity and variation of the hadronic - event - generator to model interactions above 200 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis provides evidence that a medium mass nucleus primary reproduces the shower profile quite well . </S>",
    "<S> this result does not support the idea , increasingly popular at present , that the highest energy particles are protons , derived from the decay of supermassive relic particles . on the other hand , we show that debris of relativistic super - heavy nuclei , which can survive a 100 mpc journey through the primeval radiation are likely to generate such a kind of cascade .    _ </S>",
    "<S> pacs number(s ) : _ 96.40.tv , 13.85.tp , 96.40pq .    cosmic rays , chemical composition </S>",
    "<S> , air - shower simulation    shortly after the microwave background radiation ( mbr ) was discovered @xcite , it became clear that ultra high energy cosmic rays ( crs ) undergo reactions with the relic photons yielding a steep drop in their energy attenuation length . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , if the cr sources are all at cosmological distances , the energy spectrum would exhibit a greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) cut off slightly above 100 eev ( 1 eev @xmath0ev ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral cut off is less sharp for nearby sources , _ viz . </S>",
    "<S> _ , distances @xmath1 mpc .    over the last few years </S>",
    "<S> , several giant air showers have been detected , which imply the arrival of `` super  gzk '' particles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> namely , the haverah park experiment reported several events with energies near or slightly above 100 eev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> on october 15 , 1991 the fly s eye experiment recorded the highest energy cosmic ray ever detected on earth ( @xmath2 eev ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , the akeno giant air shower array ( agasa ) has reported several remarkable cr events scattered across half the sky dramatically confirming that the cr spectrum does not end with the gzk cut off @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> many theories have been suggested to explain the origin and nature of these particles . at the most general level </S>",
    "<S> , the production mechanisms can be classified into two distinct groups : `` bottom - up '' acceleration arena , and `` top - down '' decay scenario , each of them branching out into various classes .    </S>",
    "<S> the `` bottom - up '' mechanism usually implies the stretching of rather well known acceleration processes to their theoretical limits ( and sometimes beyond ) . </S>",
    "<S> it involves particle acceleration in the accretion flows of cosmological structures . </S>",
    "<S> examples are one - shot acceleration in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) @xcite , large scale shocks resulting from structure formation @xcite , acceleration in quasar remnant cores of nearby giant elliptical galaxies @xcite , collisions of galaxies @xcite , acceleration in catastrophic events associated with gamma ray bursts @xcite , and acceleration in hot spots of extragalactic radio sources @xcite .    on the other hand , the `` top - down '' scenario ( mischievously ) escapes from the acceleration problem by assuming that charged and neutral primaries simply arise by quantum mechanical decay of supermassive elementary @xmath3 particles ( @xmath4 ev ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> sources of these exotic particles at present could be topological defects ( tds ) left over from early universe phase transitions associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking underlying unified models of high energy interactions . </S>",
    "<S> due to their topological stability , the tds ( magnetic monopoles , cosmic strings , domain walls , etc . ) </S>",
    "<S> can survive forever with @xmath3 particles trapped inside them . nevertheless , from time to time </S>",
    "<S> , some tds can be destroyed through collapse , annihilation , or other processes , and the energy stored is released in the form of massive quanta that would typically decay into quarks and leptons . </S>",
    "<S> the subsequent hadronization of the quarks would produce jets of hadrons containing mainly light mesons ( pions ) together with a small fraction ( 3% ) of nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the `` top - down '' injection spectra would be dominated by gamma rays and neutrinos originated by pion decays .    </S>",
    "<S> there have been arguments for some time that the cosmic photon background makes the universe opaque to ultra high energy gamma - rays @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the most efficient target for these rays to produce @xmath5 pairs are background photons of energy @xmath6ev @xmath7 100 mhz . </S>",
    "<S> the mean free path for a 100 eev ( 1000 eev ) photon to annihilate on the radio background is believed to be 10 - 40 mpc ( 1 - 5 mpc ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the measurement of the diffuse gamma - ray background imposes several constraints on the total amount of electromagnetic energy density injected and recycled by cascading to lower energies , yielding bounds on td injection spectra @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is also noteworthy that the expected high diffuse neutrino flux above 1 eev sets additional bounds on the `` top - down '' decay scenario @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the identity of the primary particle certainly deepens the mystery . strictly speaking </S>",
    "<S> , a 100 eev proton traverses a nearly straight line through the galactic or extragalactic magnetic fields and yet no compelling local sources have been identified within the expected scattering cone of the highest energy event @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the atmospheric shower profile is reported by fly s eye @xcite to roughly fit that of a proton , or a gamma - ray that peaks somewhat late in the atmosphere @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is also reported that a medium mass nucleus seems to fit this shower profile .    </S>",
    "<S> heavy nuclei have their own merits . </S>",
    "<S> they can be accelerated to higher terminal energies because of their larger charge . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , a heavy nucleus would have a larger scattering cone since they can be deflected more by the magnetic fields on the way to the observer . </S>",
    "<S> however , there are still other problems left in interpreting all the `` super - gzk '' events as heavy nuclei : it has long been known that above 200 eev nuclei should be photodissociated by the mbr within a few mpc @xcite , and there are few nucleus - emitting - sources in the neighborhood of the earth . </S>",
    "<S> more speculative primaries have also been proposed , such as dust grains @xcite or even neutrinos @xcite . on the one hand , </S>",
    "<S> the grains turn out to be unstable with respect to the development of a fracture . </S>",
    "<S> the path length up to the first break - up turns out to be much less than the characteristic size of the milky way @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the depth of shower maxima registered by the haverah park and volcano ranch experiments do not correspond to the expected picture of showers initiated by relativistic specks of dust @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> neutrinos , on the other hand , can traverse unscathed through the primeval radiation , but they would predominantly give rise to deeply penetrating showers in the atmosphere , again , in disagreement with observations . </S>",
    "<S> putting all these together one can navely say that aside from some nucleus species , the broad phylum of particles does not seem to fit the cascade development of the highest energy event .    </S>",
    "<S> all in all , the determination of the chemical composition appears crucial in discriminating between the possible origin of the highest energy cosmic rays . in light of this </S>",
    "<S> , we decided to re - examine the shower profile reported by the fly s eye experiment . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we present an extension of the previous analysis @xcite studying the effects of different atmospheric  cascade  models and parameter values .    </S>",
    "<S> the fly s eye observes an air shower as a nitrogen fluorescence light source which moves at the speed of light along the path of a high energy particle traversing the atmosphere @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , it directly detects the longitudinal development of the air cascade . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation of the shower evolution depends sensitively on the first few interactions , necessarily related to the quality of our `` understanding '' of hadronic collisions . </S>",
    "<S> soft multiparticle production with small transverse momenta with respect to the collision axis is a dominant feature of most events in high energy hadronic interaction . despite the fact that strict calculations based on ordinary qcd perturbation theory are not feasible </S>",
    "<S> , some phenomenological approaches successfully take into account the main properties of soft diffractive processes @xcite . in these models , </S>",
    "<S> the interactions are no longer described by single particle exchange , but by highly complicated collective modes known as reggeons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the slow growth of the cross section with the centre of mass energy requires a dominant contribution of a special reggeon , the pomeron @xcite . as a result of the diffractive interactions , constitutents get excited and produce particles , which , in the fragmentation phase , are modelled by strings @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the physical picture at super - high energies is quite different . </S>",
    "<S> interactions are not fully described within the framework of standard gribov - regge theory @xcite . at these extremely high energies , </S>",
    "<S> apart from the usual excitations of the participants , hard parton - parton collisions ( between the beam and target hadrons ) take place . </S>",
    "<S> a suitable scenario for the joint description of both , soft and semi - hard hadronic physics has yet to see the light of day . </S>",
    "<S> the well known codes qgsjet @xcite , sibyll @xcite , and dpmjet @xcite represent three of the best simulation tools to model hadronic interactions at the highest energies . </S>",
    "<S> let us now concentrate on the first two programs , and a discussion on dpmjet will follow .    </S>",
    "<S> the underlying idea behind sibyll is that the increase in the cross section is driven by the production of minijets @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the probability distribution for obtaining @xmath8 jet pairs ( with @xmath9 , being @xmath10 a sharp threshold on the transverse momentum below which hard interactions are neglected ) in a collision at energy @xmath11 is computed regarding elastic @xmath12 or @xmath13 scattering as a difractive shadow scattering associated with inelastic processes . </S>",
    "<S> the algorithms are tuned to reproduce the central and fragmentation regions data up to @xmath13 collider energies , and with no further adjustments they are extrapolated several orders of magnitude . on the other hand , in qgsjet the theory is formulated entirely in terms of pomeron exchanges . </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea is to replace the soft pomeron by a so - called `` semihard pomeron '' , which is defined to be an ordinary soft pomeron with the middle piece replaced by a qcd parton ladder . </S>",
    "<S> thus , minijets will emerge as a part of the `` semihard pomeron '' , which is itself the controlling mechanism for the whole interaction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the different approaches used in both codes to model the underlying physics show clear differences in multiplicity predictions which increase with rising energy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to stress that although the differences seem to become washed out as the shower front gets closer to the ground , the footprints of the first hadronic collisions are still present in the longitudinal development . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the first generation of particles plays a paramount role in determining the chemical composition of the `` super - gzk '' event reported by fly s eye .    in order to determine the progenitor of the highest energy event </S>",
    "<S> , we carried out a monte carlo simulation of the atmospheric shower profile using the aires program ( version 2.2.1 ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the simulation includes interaction with both the earth magnetic field and nuclei in the atmosphere . </S>",
    "<S> we have taken into account possible representative variations in the transport code , cross sections , particle multiplicity and hadronic models by using sibyll and qgsjet to generate interactions above 200 gev .    </S>",
    "<S> we generated several sets of nucleus showers with the mass equally spread in the aires range ( up to @xmath14fe ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , air - showers of superheavy nuclei were simulated following the superposition model . </S>",
    "<S> this model assumes that an average shower produced by a nucleus with energy @xmath15 and mass number @xmath16 is indistinguishable from a superposition of @xmath16 proton showers , each with energy @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the particles were injected at the top of the atmosphere ( 100 km.a.s.l ) with zenith angle 43.9@xmath18 , and the magnetic field was set to reproduce that prevailing upon fly s eye experiment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all shower particles with energies above the following thresholds were tracked : 750 kev for gammas , 900 kev for electrons and positrons , 10 mev for muons , 60 mev for mesons and 120 mev for nucleons and nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the results of these simulations were processed with the help of the aires analysis programs .    </S>",
    "<S> the data analysis is performed by means of a @xmath19 test @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the set of measured values by fly s eye are uncorrelated , i.e , any depth measurement is independent of each other . </S>",
    "<S> then , we make use of the quantity @xmath20 where @xmath8 is the total number of points in the analysis , @xmath21 is the error on the @xmath22th coordinate , @xmath22 is the measured value of the coordinate , and @xmath23 the ( hypothetical ) true value of the coordinate . generally speaking , the simulated shower profile would give a good representation of the data if the @xmath19 is roughly equal to the number of data points , i.e. , @xmath24 . for a gamma - ray primary we obtain @xmath25 , and @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> the results for different primary nuclei are shown in fig . 1 .    definite conclusions on the chemical composition </S>",
    "<S> can not be reached , mainly because of large fluctuations from model to model . without belaboring the point , </S>",
    "<S> the main differences between the hadronic - event - generators can be ascribed to two different parameters : the inelastic cross section , and the energy fraction of the parent particle converted into the production of secondary particles , the so - called `` inelasticity '' . in order to match collider data </S>",
    "<S> , the brutal truncation of the soft hadronic processes ( sibyll ) enforces interactions with a large average fraction of the energy going into the leading baryon ( elasticity ) and a small fraction into secondaries ( inelasticity ) than those governed by qgsjet . as a consequence , sibyll s showers require more generations of particles undergoing hadronic collisions , yielding a delay in the electromagnetic shower development ( strongly correlated with @xmath27 decays ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , both the cross section , and the inelasticity seem to affect the shower development in a similar fashion since increasing inelasticity as well as cross section lead to faster cascades . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , primaries with very different combination of cross section and inelasticity are able to describe the given longitudinal development </S>",
    "<S> . in particular , the large elasticity of sibyll yields a minimum on the @xmath19 above the aires nucleus range . here </S>",
    "<S> , the reader should keep in mind the crudeness of the superposition model for air shower simulations . in the simulations with qgsjet+aires , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath19 reaches a minimum at @xmath28ca , leading to a plain representation of the shower profile ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) .    the total error in the energy determination ( systematic and statistical uncertainties added in quadrature ) reported by fly </S>",
    "<S> s eye is 93 eev @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the next step in the analysis is to check whether the above results could be improved for any particular energy ( within the error ) by forcing the primary to be a proton . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we generate several sets of showers , varying the primary energy within the error box of the event . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath19 always remains very large . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 we show the result ( as a star ) obtained for the upper limit of the energy for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> the last exercise is to analyze the sensitivity of the shower simulations . to handle shower - to - shower fluctuations we separately analyze each shower initiated by a proton : after 50 showers all the @xmath19s are above 20 . </S>",
    "<S> putting all this together , the point to be made is this : even though the primary chemical composition remains hidden by the hadronic interaction model , it is evident that in both cases the shower is completely * inconsistent * with a proton , or a gamma - ray primary .    at this stage </S>",
    "<S> , it is important to stress that although the latest version of dpmjet was improved for operation up to primary energies of @xmath29 ev ( per nucleon in the lab . </S>",
    "<S> frame ) @xcite , it has not yet been effectively implemented into the standard transport codes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , one does not expect strong deviations in the longitudinal development if the hadronic collisions are modelled with dpmjet @xcite ; the results for the @xmath19 should lie somewhere between those of aires+sibyll and aires+qgsjet ( see , in particular fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5 of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) .    let us end by reviewing the current observational status , and discussing the nature of the highest energy crs .    * up to now </S>",
    "<S> , the agasa experiment reported 7 events above 100 eev . </S>",
    "<S> large shower to shower fluctuations make it difficult to get a definite dependence of composition from muon density at 1000 m from the shower core ( see fig . 3 of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is further complicated if we take into account that not only two mass components ( iron - proton ) are allowed , but that many @xmath16-values could be present . </S>",
    "<S> there is no candidate shower of gamma - ray primary in this sample @xcite . * </S>",
    "<S> the density profile of the highest energy event detected by the yakutsk experiment is almost dominated by muons , which argues against proton / gamma - ray initiation @xcite . * </S>",
    "<S> the atmospheric profile of the highest energy cosmic ray is inconsistent with that initiated by a proton or a gamma - ray . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , an analysis of the frequency distribution of the depth maximum values recorded by fly s eye , indicates that in the energy range 3 - 10 eev , there is a significant fraction of nuclei with charge greater than one @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> * very recently , the haverah park experiment reported data from inclined showers @xcite . at the `` super - gzk '' energies , the resulting spectrum is consistent with nucleus primaries ( see fig . 2 of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> we stress once more that above the photodisintegration threshold different type of debris may reach the atmosphere ; consequently , the primary mixture is far from just protons and iron nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> this sample also states evidence against the photon hypothesis .    whatever the source(s ) of the highest energy cosmic rays , because of their interactions with magnetic fields , and also with the universal diffuse radiation backgrounds permeating the universe , the energy spectra , composition and arrival directions are affected by propagation . in particular , in the case of heavy nuclei , the composition of the arriving particles may differ substantially from that of the source . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , an iron nucleus which is injected into the intergalactic medium with a lorentz factor of @xmath30 , after propagating @xmath31 mpc will end up with @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> is thus slightly different to that of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , because the increase of the threshold energy lengthens the propagation distance . </S>",
    "<S> ] such metamorphosis is the result of two basic interactions : photodisintegration and pair creation . </S>",
    "<S> the latter reduces the lorentz factor significantly during propagation avoiding the complete disintegration of the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> stecker and salamon have pointed out that a heavy nucleus emitted by the strong radio galaxy ngc315 , which is 60 mpc away and within the scattering cone of the highest energy event detected by agasa , would have an energy cut off @xmath33 eev , which may be within the uncertainty in the energy determination for this event @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it was already noted that a positively charged particle injected by the next - door galaxy m82 may have been deflected towards the arrival direction of the highest energy event @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that although m82 is not a strong radio galaxy , it has been described as the archetypal starburst galaxy ( supernova rate as high as 0.2  0.3 yr@xmath34 ) and as a prototype of superwind galaxies . in this picture , the central region of the galaxy </S>",
    "<S> harbors a population of heavy ions ( mainly produced in supernova explotions ) that could be re - accelerated to ultra high energies at the terminal shocks of galactic superwinds generated by the starburst . </S>",
    "<S> it is noteworthy that m82 could also be responsible for the `` super - gzk '' yakutsk event . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , it is interesting to point out that the regular component of the galactic magnetic field acts as a giant lens for nuclei where @xmath35 eev , yielding significant deflections of cr trajectories @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we would like to stress another remarkable feature of nucleus primaries . </S>",
    "<S> it was already noted that nuclei heavier than iron could be accelerated to super - high energies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the dominant mechanism for energy losses in the bath of the universal cosmic radiation is the photodisintegration process , which was studied in detail for the case of @xmath36au ( see fig . 2 of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> the photodisintegration rate @xmath37 of a gold nucleus with lorentz factor @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) is @xmath40 s@xmath34 ( @xmath41 s@xmath34 ) , and the energy loss time is defined by @xmath42 the energy loss due to photopair production could be estimated to be roughly @xmath43 times higher than that of a proton with the same lorentz factor , i.e. , for @xmath44 , @xmath45 s@xmath34 @xcite . for a gold nucleus </S>",
    "<S> then we get , @xmath46s ( @xmath47 s ) . now , using the previous formulae for @xmath48 , it is straightforward to show that a gold nucleus emitted with a lorentz factor after propagating 100 mpc still has an energy above 100 eev . specifically , gold nuclei injected with 197 eev , will mutate to @xmath49 with an energy @xmath50 eev , whereas for @xmath51 eev , the surviving fragment would have @xmath52 with an energy @xmath7 180 eev . note that both values are within 1 standard deviation of the highest energy event recorded by agasa ( @xmath15 = 210 eev , whose accuracy on energy determination is 30% @xcite ) . furthermore , in this case the deflections of the cr trajectories would be enough to conceal the source location . </S>",
    "<S> the above valuation together with our previous analysis suggest that elements heavier than iron are likely to generate some of the `` super - gzk '' events . </S>",
    "<S> it perhaps should be interesting to try to simulate showers initiated by super - heavy nuclei considering the internal nuclear structure , specially when the hadronic interactions are modelled with sibyll .    in summary , nucleus induced </S>",
    "<S> showers are in complete agreement with the experimental data reported by the groups of fly s eye , yakutsk , agasa and haverah park . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , if the highest energy crs are heavy nuclei , one can not yet rule out that extragalactic / galactic magnetic fields could tangle up the particle paths , camouflaging the exact location of sources . </S>",
    "<S> the astrophysics parameters governing cr propagation are still somewhat uncertain , and better statistics on the arrival directions , energy spectra and composition are indispensable for understanding the origin of the highest energy particles ocurring in nature . nonetheless , it does not seem reasonable to invoke `` top - down '' models to explain the existing data since they would fail to explain the nucleus  </S>",
    "<S> component , certainly present at the end of the spectrum . </S>"
