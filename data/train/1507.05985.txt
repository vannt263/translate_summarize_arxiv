    "bursting activity in magnetars ( neutron stars with x - ray emission powered by the decay of their strong internal magnetic fields ) is usually accompanied by changes in the spectral and temporal properties of their persistent emission . during an active period , the x - ray flux of the source increases and can occasionally reach up to three orders of magnitude higher than its quiescence level ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "this increase is usually accompanied by spectral hardening @xcite , changes in the shape of the pulse profile and the pulsed fraction ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and variation in the source timing properties , either in the form of a glitch @xcite or a more gradual change of the spin - down rate @xcite . a direct connection between all these effects , however , is still not entirely clear ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "its quiescent x - ray emission shows one of the most erratic behaviors within the magnetar population , both in its timing and its spectral properties .",
    "the source power - law spectrum hardened gradually from an index of 2.2 in 1995 to 1.6 in 2003 @xcite . the pulse profile , on the other hand , was consistently single pulsed during that time , and only changed to a double - peaked profile after the gf @xcite .",
    "the pulse frequency and frequency derivative history of the source changed dramatically in the last twenty years ( see figure  [ freqhis ] of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the latter decreased monotonically starting in 1999 , a few weeks after a small bursting activity episode , and reached a value below its 1993 historical level .",
    "it flattened out in 2002 and remained constant up to 2004 when strong bursting activity was recorded .",

    "the two observations of september and october 2004 , when the source flux was at a maximum , showed somewhat similar shapes and pfs in both bands , i.e. , a single broad peak . in all other observations",
    ", the pps differed between the two bands ( the soft pp was more complex in general than the hard one ) , and the soft band pf was lower than that of the hard band .",
    "however , we note here that due to the low statistics of the data , the soft band rms pfs were not very well constrained and their @xmath19 upper limits are consistent with the hard band pfs .",

    "we find similar values when using the pl decay trend .",
    "it is worth noting that the bb area increased during the outburst in tandem with the flux decrease from @xmath34  km@xmath35 to @xmath36  km@xmath35 .",
    "such a behavior has been seen before in a few magnetars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the pl to bb flux ratio reached maximum during the beginning of the outburst ( @xmath37 ) , where the pl flux increased by a factor 1.6 more than the bb flux ( _ panel ( i ) _ , figure  [ timespecprop ] ) .",
    "the ratio remained constant after the 2006 observation ( @xmath38 ) .",

    ". also shows one of the most erratic behaviors in its timing properties ( figure  [ freqhis ] , * ? ? ?",
    "the very early observations of the source @xcite between 1993 and 1999 showed a steady spin - down , @xmath17  hz  s@xmath1 . from early 1999 to late 2000 , the spin - down rate slowly increased to a new steady state , @xmath14  hz  s@xmath1 , that persisted up to the outburst emitted by the source starting roughly in mid 2004 .",
    "thereafter , the source exhibited an erratic behavior leading to another dramatic change in the @xmath16 trend @xcite .",
    "our follow - up analysis shows that the spin - down of the source increased again to new long - term average between july 2005 and march 2011 with a new value of @xmath15  hz  s@xmath1 .",
    "the current  spin - down rate is an order of magnitude larger than its first historical value . assuming that the spin - down rate is due to magnetic dipole radiation , the average surface dipole magnetic field strength of a magnetar is @xmath39 , where @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the spin period of the source .",
    "an increase , therefore , of @xmath16 by a factor of 10 in a span of 5.5 years would imply an increase of 3.2 in dipole magnetic field strength , which is rather unlikely",
    ". we explore below possible mechanisms that may have contributed to the torque increase on the star , hence increasing its spin - down rate .",
    "* also see @xcite ) suggested that persistent luminosity of alfven waves and particles could generate an additional torque ( besides the magnetic dipole one ) that would affect the spin - down rate of a magnetar . in this model , continuous low - level seismic activity in a slowly spinning highly - magnetized neutron star will excite magnetospheric alfven modes and induce a relativistic particle outflow out to a large radius .",
    "this particle outflow will import extra torque on the star , increasing its spin - down rate . according to @xcite , the spin - down torque increases by a factor of @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the persistent luminosity of alfven waves and particles , and @xmath44 is the magnetic dipole luminosity ( the time - average x - ray output of the sgr in quiescence derived using its dipole field @xmath45 and spin period , @xcite ) .",
    "an order of magnitude increase in spin - down from 2000 to @xmath18mid 2005 would require an increase in the particle luminosity by a factor of 100 over @xmath44 ( considering the latter to correspond to the 2000 early x - ray observations ) .",
    "an obvious effect of such a strong particle output would be a luminous wind nebula ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) . at the 8.7  kpc distance of ,",
    "the angular extent of such a wind nebula would be of the order of tens of arcseconds when considering relativistic speeds for the particle outflow , which could possibly be observed with _",
    "chandra_. such a wind nebula is , however , not detected in  @xcite .",
    "a twisted magnetosphere could also impart excess torque on a magnetar .",
    "magnetic stresses inside the star will cause motion to the footprints of the surface magnetic field lines , causing these external fields to twist @xcite .",
    "such a twisted configuration causes a slower decrease in the dipole magnetic field with increasing distance from the neutron star ( compared to the case where no twist exists ) , resulting in a stronger @xmath45 value at the light cylinder .",
    "this excess magnetic energy is then dissipated through an increase in the spin - down rate @xcite . however , if the affected twisted fields are closed field lines , this temporal variation should also be accompanied by variation in the persistent x - ray spectrum , since a twisted closed field line will have an increase in the optical depth to resonant scattering @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if the magnetic flux is dissipated through open field lines , it would affect the torques on the star at large radii without having any effect on the persistent x - ray spectrum ( e.g. , sgr  j1745@xmath72900 , * ? ? ?",
    "the spin - down should return to its pure dipole value as the twist angle decreases .",
    "the time - scale for the twist energy dissipation could be shorter than the spin period of the source , if the twist is large enough that most of the energy is dissipated through a large magnetic reconnection event , or , more interestingly , for small twist angles , the twist decay time - scale could be as long as a few years @xcite .",
    "this model could explain the continuous large spin - down rate of  up to mid 2011 .",
    "we now discuss the long - term spectral evolution of the  x - ray emission after its 2004 major bursting episode .",
    ", similar to many other magnetar sources , has a 1 - 10  kev spectrum well fit with the combination of a thermal ( bb ) , and a non - thermal ( pl ) component . in the magnetar model ,",
    "the bb component is due to internal heating from the decay of the strong magnetic field , while the non - thermal component is due to resonant cyclotron scattering of these thermal photons by the plasma in the magnetosphere ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "after the 2004 bursting episode , the flux of the bb and pl increased , while showing spectral hardening ( bb temperature increased and pl index , @xmath46 , decreased ) .",
    "such a flux - hardness relation is a prediction of the model presented in @xcite and a very common phenomenon among magnetar sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one of the models usually invoked to explain the outburst evolution of a magnetar is of external magnetospheric origin @xcite . in this model , a twist in the magnetosphere , if acting on a bundle of closed field lines , would increase their particle charge density .",
    "returning currents from these field lines would hit their surface footprints , covering a certain area @xmath47 on the surface , heating it and causing radiation of thermal photons .",
    "these thermal photons , in turn , are compton scattered to higher energies by the plasma in the bundle .",
    "as the twist relaxes back to its original untwisted configuration , the bundle disappears gradually , and both the thermal and non - thermal components decrease back to their quiescent level .",
    "the relaxation time - scale of the bundle , @xmath48  s , depends primarily on the footprint size @xmath49  cm@xmath35 , the magnetic dipole moment @xmath51  g  @xmath52 , and the electric voltage sustaining its plasma density , @xmath53  v @xcite . considering a large dipole field @xmath54  g , a voltage @xmath55  v , and the area of the bb component @xmath56 with @xmath57  km@xmath35 ( table  [ specparam ] )",
    ", one can roughly reconcile the long relaxation time for , @xmath58  s , with the one predicted by this model .",
    "however , the model also predicts that @xmath47 decreases with decreasing flux , which we do not observe in the data ( figure  [ timespecprop ] ) .",
    "moreover , the pl flux increased by a factor of @xmath59 more than the bb after the onset of the outburst ( the 2004 observations ) , compared to the following observations ( after october 2005 ) where their ratio was more or less constant - a behavior that does not seem to agree with the twisted magnetospheric model .",
    "heating of the crust from re - arragement of the internal magnetic field , e.g. , due to a sudden crack of the crust , is also used to reproduce the relaxation light curve of magnetars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this picture ,",
    "a total energy of the order of @xmath60  ergs is suddenly deposited into the crust , and re - radiated gradually in the form of thermal photons .",
    "the total energy emitted from throughout the outburst supports these numbers .",
    "however , the decay time - scale for such models is expected to be much shorter ( of the order of @xmath61  days ) than the years time - scale we calculate for  ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "it is remarkable that the pf of  has remained at a constant value of about 7%  from 1994 to 2011 ( it only changed for a short period of time immediately after the gf , @xcite ) , while all its other properties changed drastically .",
    "this could be an indication that the geometry ( and location , e.g. , close to the magnetic poles ) of the emitting region has remained essentially the same for the last two decades .",
    "finally , we note that there has been attempts to link the intrinsic properties of magnetars ( e.g. , @xmath16 , @xmath45 ) with their observed x - ray properties @xcite .",
    "such correlations assume that the measured intrinsic properties of these sources outside of bursting episodes are their `` true '' values ( assuming a dipole configuration ) .",
    "it is clear from our analysis of  ( see also @xcite ) that such assumption is not necessarily correct .",
    "the spin - down rate we measure for the late _ xmm - newton_observations - clearly outside of major bursting episodes - represents an order of magnitude variation in about six years .",
    "hence , the `` true '' @xmath16 , and by extrapolation @xmath45 , are currently unknown for",
