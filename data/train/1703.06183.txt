    "convergence of a dynamical system to a stable equilibrium point can only arise from irreversible , dissipative behavior . for quantum dynamics , characterizing the stability properties of equilibrium states of both naturally occurring and controlled dissipative evolutions is a fundamental problem , whose significance ranges from mathematical aspects of open - quantum system theory @xcite and non - equilibrium quantum statistical mechanics @xcite , to dissipative quantum control and quantum engineering @xcite . within quantum information processing ( qip )",
    "@xcite , a main motivation for investigating _ quantum stabilization _ problems is provided by the key task of preparing a target quantum state from an arbitrary initial condition .",
    "notably , highly entangled pure states are a resource for measurement - based quantum computation @xcite as well as quantum communication technologies @xcite ; likewise , the preparation of both ground and thermal ( gibbs ) states of physically relevant hamiltonians is a prerequisite for quantum simulation algorithms @xcite . from a condensed - matter physics standpoint ,",
    "methods for preparing many - body quantum states may unlock new possibilities for accessing exotic phases of synthetic quantum matter in controlled laboratory settings @xcite .    compared to the standard approach to pure - state preparation @xcite  namely ,",
    "the initialization of the system in a fiducial product state via a fixed ( necessarily dissipative ) `` cooling '' mechanism , followed by a unitary quantum circuit  the use of _ tailored _ dissipative dynamics affords two important practical advantages : not only is precise initialization no longer needed , but , any `` transient '' noise effect is effectively re - absorbed without the need for active intervention , as long as the target state is globally attractive .",
    "crucially , the _ invariance _ requirement that the dissipative dynamics must obey for the target state to be not only prepared but , additionally , stabilized , allows for a further important advantage : once reached , the desired state may be accessed at any time afterward  which is especially beneficial in scenarios where the retrieval time is not ( or can not ) be precisely specified in advance . as a result , methods for engineering dissipation are garnering increasing attention across different experimental qip platforms .",
    "in particular , steady - state entanglement generation has been successfully demonstrated in systems as diverse as atomic ensembles @xcite , trapped ions @xcite , superconducting qubits @xcite , and electron - nuclear spins in diamond @xcite .",
    "it is important to appreciate that the problem of designing stabilizing dynamics is both physically relevant and mathematically non - trivial only in the presence of _ constraints _ on the available dynamical resources : if arbitrary completely - positive trace - preserving ( cptp ) quantum maps @xcite are able to be implemented , then any desired quantum state ( pure or mixed ) may be made invariant and attractive in a single time step @xcite .",
    "similarly , for continuous - time markovian quantum dynamics described by a lindblad master equation @xcite , one may show that application of a time - independent hamiltonian together with a single noise operator suffices to achieve stabilization in the generic case in principle @xcite . for multipartite quantum systems of relevance to both qip and statistical mechanics",
    ", an important constraint stems from the fact that physical hamiltonians and noise ( kraus or lindblad ) operators typically represent couplings that affect non - trivially a `` small '' number of subsystems at a time ; mathematically , they are required to be _ quasi - local _ ( ql ) relative to the underlying tensor - product decomposition , in an appropriate sense . to date , significant theoretical effort has been devoted to investigating ql state stabilization problems under continuous - time lindblad dynamics , both in specific physically motivated settings  see e.g. @xcite for a partial list of contributions  and within a general system - theoretic framework @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we consider the problem of stabilizing a pure quantum state of interest using _ time - dependent discrete - time dynamics _ , as implemented by sequences of cptp maps , subject to a specified ql constraint .",
    "such a setting is most natural from a qip perspective , as it embodies a dissipative quantum circuit picture that directly generalizes the unitary quantum circuit model and is ideally suited for `` digital '' open - system quantum simulation @xcite ; further to that , it is also fundamentally more general : it is well known that there exists indivisible cptp dynamics , which _ can not _ be obtained from exponentiating continuous time - dependent markovian dynamics @xcite , as also emphasized in recent approaches to quantum channel construction @xcite .",
    "most importantly to our scope , discrete - time dynamics support a different type of convergence to equilibrium with respect to continuous - time counterparts : _ exact _ convergence in _ finite time _ , as opposed to asymptotic convergence  in which case the target state can be reached only _ approximately _ at any finite time and which , as we shall see , is the only possibility for lindblad dynamics .",
    "while finite - time ( or `` dead - beat '' ) controllers have been extensively analyzed and exploited in the context of classical digital control systems @xcite , they have received far less attention in quantum engineering as yet .",
    "a general scheme for pure - state stabilization in finite time has been proposed in @xcite ; however , no ql constraint is explicitly incorporated and feedback capabilities are assumed . building on our complementary analysis of asymptotic convergence properties of time - dependent sequences of cptp maps in @xcite , our main focus here is open - loop ql finite - time stabilization ( fts ) of a target quantum state : what ensures that stabilization may be attained in finite time under the prescribed ql constraint ?",
    "further to that , what properties may enable fts to be achieved _",
    "robustly _ , in a way that is independent upon the order of implementation of the applied cptp maps ? clearly , the possibility of robust finite - time stabilization ( rfts ) is especially appealing from both a control - theoretic and a practical perspective , as it allows for `` unsupervised '' control implementation or , equivalently , for the dissipative quantum circuit to be applied `` asynchronously ''  thus recovering a desirable feature of time - independent stabilization schemes .    with the above questions in mind ,",
    "the content of the paper and our main results may be summarized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : prelim ] we introduce the necessary background and mathematical tools , with emphasis on spelling out the relevant stability notions .",
    "in particular , we explicitly show ( see sec . [",
    "sub : nogo ] ) that no continuous - time lindblad master equation can converge exactly to a globally attractive equilibrium in finite time . in sec .",
    "[ sec : fts ] we develop both necessary and sufficient conditions for determining if a target state can , in principle , be ft - stabilized . in the case",
    "that a state is verified to be fts , we explicitly demonstrate the existence of ql stabilizing dynamics , which entails the repeated application of a fixed cooling map , suitably interspersed with unitary dynamics .",
    "we stress that , despite superficial similarity , fts bears important differences from dissipative quantum circuits implementing `` sequential generation '' @xcite , whereby the system of interest is sequentially coupled to an ancilla , and a matrix product state representation of the target state is used to obtain a sequence of cptp maps as the ancilla is traced over : not only does the joint system plus ancilla pair require proper ( pure - state ) initialization , but no invariance is guaranteed in general .",
    "rather , our fts scheme may be thought of as a ql generalization of the `` splitting - subspace '' approach introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "sections [ sec : necessary ] and [ sec : sufficient ] , which form the core of the paper , are devoted to presenting several necessary and , respectively , sufficient conditions for rfts . in particular , we show how rfts requires the correlations present in the target state to be restricted in mathematically precise ways .",
    "interestingly , while our necessary rfts conditions bear similarity with criteria on clustering of correlations which have recently been proved to ensure efficient preparation of thermal ( gibbs ) states using dissipative ql circuits @xcite , a main difference is the invariance requirement on the target , which is central in our approach . as emphasized above and in @xcite , one implication of the invariance property",
    "is that repeating the stabilization protocol ( or even portions of it ) may be used as a means to maintain the system in the target state over time , if so desired . in developing sufficient conditions for rfts",
    ", we leverage the observation that product states are ( trivially ) rfts to seek a description of the target state in terms of a _ virtual subsystem decomposition _ @xcite , relative to which it may factorize , in a sense that we make precise .",
    "we find that , counterintuitively , a pure state may be ft - stabilizable  albeit _ not _ rfts  even when its `` natural '' , frustration - free ql parent hamiltonian is _ non - commuting _ ; at the same time , we also uncover examples of states , which _ are _ rfts and whose natural parent hamiltonian is non - commuting ",
    "albeit in those cases a different , _ commuting _ parent hamiltonian may also be identified . beside providing conditions that ensure the rfts task to be possible for a given target and locality constraints , our results",
    "may alternatively be used to construct classes of non - trivially entangled target states that are guaranteed to be rfts for a given ql constraint . in particular",
    "( see sec .",
    "[ sub : nonconstructive ] ) , we introduce a class of tensor network states @xcite that are rfts relative to a ql structure determined by the underlying graph , upon generalizing a construction due to bravyi and vyalyi @xcite _ beyond _ the original two - body setting . while our primary focus throughout the present analysis is on pure target states ,",
    "we isolate in sec .",
    "[ sub : mixed ] those results that are directly applicable or extend to mixed target states ; in particular , we exhibit a class of rfts gibbs states .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : efficiency ] we explore the efficiency of the proposed fts schemes in both the non - robust and robust settings , by providing , in particular , an upper bound to the circuit complexity of rfts protocols for ql constraints defined on a lattice .",
    "finally , since ft convergence is a particularly strong form of convergence , it is natural to explore the extent to which it may be related to `` rapidly mixing '' ql continuous - time dynamics , which is able to efficiently prepare an equilibrium state @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rapid ] , we indeed show that as long as the sufficient conditions for a target state to be rfts are obeyed , there always exists a ql liouvillian which is rapidly mixing with respect to the target . nonetheless , it is possible for a state to admit rapidly mixing dynamics that asymptotically prepares it , while violating the necessary conditions for rfts .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : end ] by highlighting open problems and directions for further investigation . in order to progressively build insight and maintain continuity in the presentation flow ,",
    "we have emphasized illustrative examples to the extent possible and deferred all of the technical proofs to an appendix at the end of the paper .",
    "we consider a finite - dimensional multipartite target system @xmath0 , consisting of @xmath1 distinguishable subsystems and described on a hilbert space @xmath2 , with dim@xmath3 and each @xmath4 .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath5 the space of all linear operators on @xmath6 .",

    "in particular , as mentioned , we require that each map acts _ quasi - locally_. following our previous work @xcite , the notion of quasi - locality we consider may be formally described by a _ neighborhood structure _ , @xmath15 , on the multipartite hilbert space .",

    "it is worth remarking that rapid mixing also ensures that the dynamics are `` stable '' with respect to local perturbations of the generator @xcite : these stability results clearly apply to the ql lindblad dynamics we constructed above .",
    "we conclude by showing that , while rft convergence implies , in the sense we characterized , rapid convergence in continuous time , the converse does _ not _ hold in general : there exist target states which admit rapidly mixing continuous - time dynamics , yet support correlations beyond what is allowed for rfts :    in @xcite it is shown that for 1d lattice systems , the davies generator derived from a commuting hamiltonian achieves rapid mixing with respect to the corresponding gibbs state .",
    "consider the 1d ferromagnetic nn ising model , @xmath575 , with @xmath576 .",
    "it is well known that , in the thermodynamic limit , for any finite temperature , the two - point correlations of this gibbs state are exponentially decaying with distance : @xmath577 , with @xmath578 finite , see e.g. @xcite . therefore , spins with disjoint neighborhood expansions are correlated , which violates the necessary condition for rfts given in theorem [ thm : necessary_robust ] .",
    "we have explored the task of _ exactly _ stabilizing a target pure state in finite time using dissipative quantum circuits consisting of sequences of ql cptp maps  a task that , even in ideal conditions , may only be achieved with finite error by using continuous - time markovian dynamics . in developing both necessary and sufficient conditions for fts , one important aim was to elucidate the role of _ commutativity _ of a frustration - free parent hamiltonian one may naturally associate to the target state .",
    "we showed that certain cases of the well - known valence - bond - solid states _ are _ fts relative to nn constraints , despite not being the ground state of any commuting nn hamiltonian .",
    "the remainder of the paper focused on the case where stabilization may be achieved _ robustly _ , i.e. , independently of the order of the dissipative maps  a setting which is especially attractive from both a control - theoretic and implementation standpoint .",
    "we developed several examples of non - trivially entangled rfts states beyond the stabilizer formalism .",
    "notably , these include controlled - controlled - z states , which are a universal resource for measurement - based quantum computation and display 2d symmetry - protected topological order @xcite , as well as a class of tensor network states obtained from a generalization of the bravyi - vyalyi construction @xcite , whereby the tensors of the construction are leveraged to build a commuting sequence of stabilizing maps .",
    "the common feature of these examples , which ensures their rfts , is a factorization of the target state with respect to a set of _ neighborhood - compatible virtual subsystems_. through this decomposition , we have further clarified the role played by `` commuting structures '' in robustly stabilizing a state : although commutativity of the canonical parent hamiltonian is , remarkably , _ not _ necessary for rfts , our general sufficient condition ensures the existence of some commuting parent hamiltonian , although in a non - constructive way .",
    "finally , we showed that if a state admits such a neighborhood - respecting virtual - subsystem factorization , then there exist ql lindblad dynamics which efficiently prepare this state ( i.e. , which satisfy rapid - mixing conditions ) .",
    "we leave a number of directions for future work . at this point",
    ", we have only developed a non - constructive scheme for fts in the non - robust case .",
    "obtaining _ constructive _ procedures for synthesizing such stabilizing dynamics while complying with the ql constraint is an interesting control problem , which might be able to be tackled with methods from geometric control theory .",
    "likewise , in the rfts setting , we _ conjecture _ that a virtual - subsystem factorization of the target state is not only sufficient , as we prove , but , in fact , needed . were this conjecture shown to be false , such a counterexample would correspond to a surprising class of quantum states that are very efficient to exactly stabilize , yet exhibit entanglement between particles with respect to any neighborhood - respecting virtual - subsystem decomposition .",
    "as we mentioned , the authors of @xcite have also characterized dissipative circuits for efficiently preparing ( albeit _ not _ stabilizing ) thermal states , under appropriate conditions .",
    "it would be interesting to further investigate connections between their use of the petz recovery map @xcite and the stabilizing maps that we employ for rfts .",
    "related to that , towards extending their approach to a continuous - time scheme , it may be useful to first develop a _ robust _ variation of their algorithm .",
    "the algebraic construction that we provide , along with the connections to rapid mixing , may shed light on such an extension .    from a more practical perspective",
    ", the assumption of error - free control dynamics we have employed throughout our analysis is clearly an idealization . in order to assess the viability of the proposed stabilization schemes ,",
    "analyzing their performance against different kinds of implementation errors will be crucial , both in terms of obtaining rigorous , system - independent bounds for _ approximate fts _ and quantitative results for specific dissipative - engineering platforms .",
    "in this respect , we emphasize that implementation of discrete - time dynamics and entangled - state `` pumping '' via engineered dissipation has already been experimentally demonstrated in trapped ions @xcite ; thus trapped ions could further be natural candidates for exploring rfts protocols . very recently , a proposal for discrete - time dissipative control in circuit qed systems has also been put forward @xcite , based on the idea of using the fock states of a microwave - cavity mode to encode a @xmath579-dimensional target system , dispersively coupled to a transmon - qubit ancilla . despite important differences ( notably , the infinite - dimensional nature of the oscillator mode ) it would be very interesting to explore protocols for ft state stabilization or , more generally , ft encoding and quantum error correction  by respecting the constraints native to such a system .",
