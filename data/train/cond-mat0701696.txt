    "for a long time , the anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) attracts increasing attraction from both theoretical and experimental viewpoint . in general , the hall resistivity is given by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the magnetic field and @xmath8 is the ordinary hall coefficient due to the lorentz force .",
    "@xmath9 is the anomalous hall coefficient in the presence of magnetization @xmath10 . in ferromagnets , @xmath9 is usually at least one order of magnitude larger than @xmath8 . in paramagnetic heavy fermion ( hf ) systems , @xmath11 takes a huge value due to the ahe since the uniform susceptibility @xmath12 in hf is about @xmath13 times larger than that in usual metals owing to the strong coulomb interaction .",
    "recently , the ahe in transition metal ferromagnets has been intensively studied experimentally .",
    "for example , the ahe in ferromagnetic pyrochlore oxides shows interesting behaviors @xcite .",
    "the ahe is also observed in ferromagnetic spinels @xcite and in ru , ti oxides @xcite .",
    "several multilayer systems @xcite also show distinct ahe .",
    "the ahe in spin glass systems had been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the theoretical study of ahe was initiated by karplus and luttinger ( kl ) @xcite in 1954 .",
    "they found that the anomalous hall conductivity ( ahc ) @xmath14 is finite and dissipation - less ( i.e. , @xmath15 is independent of resistivity @xmath2 ) when @xmath16 .",
    "this kl - term is called the `` intrinsic ahe '' because it exists independent of impurities . in 1958 , smit presented a mechanism of `` extrinsic ahe '' @xcite : he found that spin polarized electrons are scattered asymmetrically around an impurity in the presence of spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the ahc due to this skew - scattering mechanism is linearly proportional to @xmath2 if elastic scattering is dominant .",
    "the above two works were reproduced and refined in a unified way by luttinger @xcite by using the transport theory of kohn and luttinger , and his work were also reproduced by linear - response theory using diagrammatic technique @xcite . in 1970 , berger proposed another mechanism of extrinsic ahe , the side jump due to impurities @xcite .",
    "this mechanism gives the ahc in proportion to @xmath17 .",
    "note that the extrinsic ahe vanishes in a clean system without impurity .    for a long time",
    ", the ahe had been generally regarded as an extrinsic effect , and the intrinsic ahe proposed by kl had been underestimated .",
    "this would be because the theoretical model assumed in ref .",
    "@xcite was too oversimplified .",
    "moreover , ref .",
    "@xcite could not offer a specific expression for @xmath18 .",
    "recently , however , various experiments suggest that the intrinsic ahe @xmath19 is dominant in many transition metal ferromagnets @xcite even in good metals with @xmath20 : it is surprising because the extrinsic ahc @xmath21 should be dominant when @xmath2 is small , if inelastic scattering is negligibly small .",
    "we here remind readers that the extrinsic ahc is very sensitive to the statistical property of impurity potential @xmath22 ; for instance , it vanishes when the average value of @xmath23 is zero @xcite .",
    "after luttinger s work @xcite , theory of intrinsic ahe has been developed by many authors . in general , @xmath24 is composed of the `` fermi surface term '' and the `` fermi sea term '' ; the latter comes from quasiparticles inside of the fermi sea , and it could exist even in insulators @xcite .",
    "( note that the conductivity @xmath25 is composed of only the fermi surface term . )",
    "the term of the ahc derived by kl is a part of the `` fermi sea term '' .",
    "recently , m. onoda and nagaosa @xcite and sundaram and niu @xcite found that kl s ahc is expressed in terms of the `` berry curvature '' @xcite .",
    "( note that luttinger showed in his model that there is a term which almost cancels the berry curvature term @xcite . ) on the other hand , kontani and yamada derived the intrinsic ahe due to the `` fermi surface term '' based on the linear - response theory for the first time @xcite .",
    "they studied ahc in an orbitally degenerate periodic anderson model , and succeeded in explaining the ahe in hf systems ; @xmath26 below the coherent temperature @xmath27 , whereas @xmath28 above @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "this results explain the experimental fact that the hall coefficients in hf systems are proportional to @xmath17 below @xmath27 .",
    "miyazawa et al . proved that the intrinsic ahe also occurs in @xmath29-@xmath30 models with orbital degree of freedoms @xcite .",
    "later , ahc s for fe and srruo@xmath31 were calculated based on the lda band calculations @xcite .",
    "we still have to deepen the understanding of the mechanism of ahe to explain experimental results in transition ferromagnetic metals .",
    "for example , a recent experiment by asamitsu et al . has revealed that the intrinsic ahc @xmath32 is observed in many ferromagnets for @xmath33 , whereas @xmath15 starts to decrease in proportion to @xmath34 and @xmath35 in bad metals where @xmath36 .",
    "this drastic crossover is reminiscent of the ahe in heavy fermion systems discussed in ref .",
    "therefore , a detailed study based on an appropriate model for transition metals is highly required .",
    "in the present paper , we study the intrinsic ahc in a tight - binding model with @xmath0-orbitals ( @xmath37-orbitals ) , which originate from the @xmath38-orbitals @xmath39 in the tetragonal crystalline field .",
    "the band structure of this model corresponds to @xmath40 and @xmath41 bands of sr@xmath42ruo@xmath43 @xcite .",
    "we derive a general expression for the ahc valid for any damping rate @xmath4 , which enables us to study the ahc in bad metals .",
    "we show that the ahc is mainly given by the fermi surface term for a wide range of @xmath4 since the kl s term is canceled by another fermi sea term in a metallic state .",
    "we also find that the anomalous velocity due to @xmath44-@xmath45 hopping gives rise to a large ahc comparable to experimental values ( about @xmath46 ; @xmath47 being the lattice constant ) , which will be a main origin of a huge ahc in transition metal ferromagnets . in good metals ,",
    "the intrinsic ahc is independent of @xmath48 as is well known .",
    "however , it becomes proportional to @xmath3 in bad metals where @xmath4 is larger than the band - splitting around the fermi level , @xmath5 .",
    "this crossover behavior of the ahc can explain a recent observation of the ahe by a. asamitsu et al .      here , we shortly explain the mechanisms of both the intrinsic ahe and the extrinsic ahe in more detail : the intrinsic ahe ( both fermi surface and fermi sea terms ) originates from the interband transition of quasiparticles due to off - diagonal terms of the velocity @xmath49 and the orbital angular momentum @xmath50 .",
    "( the diagrammatic expression for @xmath18 is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] . )",
    "the off - diagonal velocity contains the `` anomalous velocity '' ( e.g. @xmath51 ) , which gives rise to the ahe .",
    "since it is a purely quantum effect , it is difficult to find a simple classical analogue except for rashba - type 2d electron gas model @xcite .",
    "this might be a reason why the intrinsic ahe had been discounted for a long time . in the present model ,",
    "a large anomalous velocity naturally comes from the inter - orbital ( @xmath52-@xmath53 ) hopping . by this reason ,",
    "atomic @xmath29-orbitals are necessary to reproduce a huge ahc in real ferromagnets .",
    "on the other hand , the extrinsic ahe ( the skew - scattering mechanism and the side - jump mechanism ) happens even in a single - band model , although it is enhanced due to a multiband effect @xcite .",
    "extrinsic ahcs due to skew - scattering mechanism and the side - jump mechanism are proportional to @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "the former is caused by spin - dependent asymmetric scattering around the impurity in the presence of spin - orbit coupling , and the latter is caused by lateral displacement of the wave - packet during the scattering @xcite .",
    "diagrammatically , both skew - scattering and side - jump are expressed by _ current vertex corrections _",
    "due to impurity potential , as shown in ref . @xcite .",
    "in general , detailed knowledge on the impurity potential is needed for a quantitative study of the extrinsic ahe . in the present paper",
    ", we do not study the extrinsic ahe since recent several experiments suggest that the skew scattering term is small even in good metals @xcite .",
    "for a long time , it was believed that the ahe is independent of the _ self - energy correction _ due to impurity potential .",
    "however , we show that the intrinsic ahc is reduced by the self - energy correction in bad metal . by this reason ,",
    "change of the scaling law in the ahc at @xmath56 cm reported by asamitsu el at .",
    "is well explained in terms of the intrinsic ahe .",
    "in the present paper , we study a square lattice tight - binding model with @xmath52 and @xmath53 orbitals , which is a simplified version of the @xmath0-@xmath57 model .",
    "miyazawa et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the ahe exists in the latter model .",
    "however , they could not derive an explicit expression for ahc . here , we derive explicit expressions for both the `` fermi surface term '' and the `` fermi sea term '' based on the present simplified model .",
    "the @xmath58-coupling term is indispensable for the ahe in ferromagnets : in a ferromagnetic metal with @xmath59 , the @xmath58-coupling term @xmath60 is approximately proportional to @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the coupling constant .",
    "the ahe is caused by the inter - orbital transition of quasiparticles due to the off - diagonal elements of @xmath63 @xcite . in a paramagnetic metal under @xmath64 ,",
    "on the other hand , zeeman term for the angular momentum , @xmath65 , gives rise to the ahe @xcite .",
    "therefore , the ahe in paramagnetic metals and that in ferromagnetic ones are caused by the same transport mechanism , although the origins of magnetizations are different .",
    "we consider that the present model with @xmath52- and @xmath53-orbitals describes a major part of the ahe in transition metal ferromagnets : in cubic or tetragonal crystals , @xmath66 is nonzero only when @xmath67 @xmath68 $ ] and @xmath69 @xmath70 $ ] . because levels of @xmath52 and @xmath53 orbitals are degenerate ,",
    "the band structures composed of these orbitals are energetically close .",
    "this fact will be favorable to the interband hopping of quasiparticles between @xmath52 and @xmath53 orbitals , which is indispensable for the ahe .",
    "on the other hand , energy splitting between @xmath71-orbital and @xmath72-orbital is of the order of 1ev in square or tetragonal crystals .",
    "therefore , the interband hopping of quasiparticles between @xmath71- and @xmath72-orbitals would be difficult . as a result",
    ", the main contribution to the ahe in transition metal oxides will come from the inter - orbital transition between @xmath52- and @xmath53-orbitals .",
    "this is the reason why we study the @xmath0-orbital tight - binding model .    here ,",
    "we represent the creation operator of an electron on @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) orbital as @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian without @xmath58-coupling is given by @xmath77 , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 . here ,",
    "@xmath83 and @xmath84 are the hopping integrals between nearest - neighbors and next - nearest - neighbors , respectively @xcite .",
    "they are shown in fig .",

    "this fact gives rise to the anomalous velocity . ]    then , the velocity matrix is given by @xmath85 , where @xmath86 .",

    "they are called `` anomalous velocity '' . in later sections",
    ", we will show that @xmath15 is proportional to @xmath93 , which can remain finite after the @xmath94-summation due to the anomalous velocity .",

    "<S> the intrinsic ahc is constant ( dissipation - less ) as found by karplus and luttinger . in bad metals , however , we find that the ahc is proportional to @xmath3 when @xmath4 is larger than the minimum band - splitting measured from the fermi level , @xmath5 . </S>",
