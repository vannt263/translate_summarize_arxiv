    "one scenario for the high temperature superconductivity in cuprates @xcite is the preformed cooper pairs idea that was first proposed by anderson @xcite .",
    "this theory is based on the strong correlation effects and it does not incorporate phonons in the pairing mechanism . on the other hand , many experiments have been reported indicating the importance of electron phonon interaction in understanding the physics of high tc cuprates , such as the oxygen isotope effect on both the transition temperature of superconductivity and the london penetration depth @xcite .",
    "observation of the strong isotope effect in cuprates has led many authors to employ the strong limit of the electron phonon interaction as the primary cause of the superconductivity in these materials @xcite .",
    "for example , some workers have applied bipolaron theory of superconductivity to the high temperature superconductivity problem .",
    "this theory requires the breakdown of the migdal - eliashberg theory and is based on the non - adiabatic limit of the electron phonon interaction , where phonons have a much larger energy than electrons .",
    "experimentally , a typical energy of electrons is around the exchange energy @xmath3 130 mev @xcite , while the energy of optical phonons is @xmath4 mev @xcite . on the other hand , the breakdown of the migdal - eliashberg theory @xcite in any phonon based theory is crucial , because isotope experiments in cuprates are very different from conventional superconductors that are explained by the bcs theory @xcite and its generalization , _",
    "i.e. _ migdal - eliashberg theory .",
    "some authors emphasize on the importance of the microscopic inhomogeneity , charge and spin stripes in understanding the mechanism of the superconductivity @xcite .",
    "the idea is that the phase segregation can save kinetic energy of holes and the exchange energy of spins .",
    "stripe models are based on the competition between this phase and other states of matter .",
    "it is noteworthy that static stripes have been observed only in la@xmath5scuo@xmath6 family near @xmath7 , not in ybco family , but dynamical stripes are expected even away from @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the idea of anderson can be implemented using the slave particle method @xcite .",
    "the u(1 ) version of this method explains many basic properties of cuprates successfully .",
    "however , this method has several limitations .",
    "for example , the u(1 ) slave boson method overestimates the transition temperature of the superconducting state by an order of magnitude .",
    "although in experiments only @xmath1 vortices have been observed , this method predicts another @xmath8 vortices as well . for clean d - wave superconductors ,",
    "the superfluid density decreases linearly with temperature up to the leading order .",
    "experimentally the coefficient of this linear term is not very sensitive to the doping , while the u(1 ) slave boson treatment predicts a @xmath9 doping dependence , where @xmath10 is the doping percentage . in this paper",
    "we argue that phonons can mediate attractive interaction between holons and therefore we find a paired holon state .",
    "we show that this assumption resolves the three mentioned limitations of the u(1 ) slave boson approach . here",
    "we extend the anderson theory of high @xmath11 which is based on the resonating valence bond(rvb ) state , by adding holstein hamiltonian such that the model hamiltonian include the effect of electron phonon interaction .",
    "rvb state is the superposition of all possible singlet states between any two sites .",
    "the idea of rvb state can be quantified using the slave boson method , and naturally leads to the spin charge separation in two spatial dimensions .",
    "the low energy excitations of this state are described by the charged spinless quasiparticles which are called holon and are treated as bosons , and the neutral spin 1/2 quasiparticles which are called spinon and are treated as fermions .",
    "this can be implemented by writing the creation operator of physical electrons @xmath12 as the product of a fermionic operator @xmath13 and a bosonic operator @xmath14 .",
    "therefore @xmath15 .",
    "this assumption comes along with the nondoubly occupancy constraint due to very large onsite repulsion between electrons in cuprates . in terms of slave particles @xmath16 at every site .",
    "therefore at each site , we have either a holon or a spinon . using this relation ,",
    "the density of holon gas is set by doping @xmath10 , and the density of spinons is equal to the density of electrons @xmath17 .",
    "spinon pairing forms cooper pairs in the system and holon condensation provides the phase coherence for these pairs and the superfluid density of the superconducting state is controlled by the condensation fraction of holons .",
    "therefore , to obtain superconducting phase , both holon gas and spinon gas should condense . in case of spinons",
    ", we need a pairing mechanism due to their fermionic nature .",
    "strong antiferromagnetic interactions in cuprates can result in such a pairing potential and as a result the transition temperature of spinon paired state is controlled by the exchange energy @xmath18 which is quite large .",
    "this large gap in excitation spectrum of spinons is the origin of the pseudogap phenomenon in cuprates .    on the other hand , due to the bosonic nature of holons",
    ", they do not need a pairing mechanism and they can undergo bose einstein condensation(bec ) .",
    "although this can be in general true , we discuss in the following sections that the phenomenology of cuprates supports the holon pair condensation scenario .",
    "this assumption immediately resolves several limitations of the anderson theory . in order to pair holons , like in the bcs theory",
    ", we need a pairing mechanism . in our theory ,",
    "electron phonon interaction can cause such a pairing instability . as we have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , this assumption can also explain the observed phonon experiments successfully .",
    "in summary in this framework spinons form rvb pairs and holons are also paired by phonons .",
    "both of these are required for the superconductivity in cuprates .",
    "this approach , gives a phase diagram similar to the phase diagram of the conventional u(1 ) slave boson treatment of the t - j model , except that the superconducting state has @xmath19 gauge symmetry , and we obtain a better estimation of @xmath0 , closer to the experimental data(see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we have also shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , that at least at half filling , the antiferromagnetic order in the hubbard model can be achieved by including a nonzero triplet component in the pairing amplitude besides the singlet component @xcite .",
    "now let us briefly comment on the experimental consequences of our theory . in appendix",
    ", we present more details and derive equations .",
    "is the optimal doping percentage which is typically around % 15 .",
    "it corresponds to the optimum transition temperature which is typically around 100 kelvin .",
    "sc is the superconducting state in which we obtain spinon pair condensation and holon pair condensation .",
    "pg is the pseudogap phase where spinons are paired but holon gas in not condensed .",
    "fl is the fermi liquid phase where we obtain single holon condensation but no spinon pair condensation .",
    "sm is the strange metal in which neither holons nor spinons condense . in this approach",
    ", spinons form rvb pairs due to anti - ferromagnetic interactions and holons are paired by phonons .",
    "both of these are required to obtain the superconducting phase in cuprates .",
    "we have not shown af order in this phase diagram , however we have shown in ref . @xcite that it can be achieved by adding a nonzero triplet component to the pairing amplitude near half filling.,title=\"fig : \" ] +",
    "in the underdoped cuprates , both the slave boson theory and the phase fluctuation studies of superconductors predict that the transition temperature of the superconducting state is controlled by the superfluid density . using ioffe - larkin recombination formula ( see appendix c for derivations and discussions )",
    ", it can be shown that at small dopings , the superfluid density is mostly determined by that of holons .",
    "therefore @xmath0 is determined by the bec transition temperature @xmath20 , of holon gas . in the single holon condensation theories we obtain @xmath21 .",
    "although this gives a good doping dependence , it is an order of magnitude higher than the superconducting transition temperature @xcite . in the pair condensation scenario ,",
    "we obtain the following expression for @xmath0 ( see appendix b for derivation ) @xmath22 where @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the pseudogap energy , is the renormalized coupling constant of the phonon mediated holon holon attraction , and @xmath25 is the density of states . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we had to chose @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the energy of optical phonons , to fit theory and experiment . in cuprates , @xmath28 and therefore @xmath29 .",
    "because of the extra factor in the denominator , @xmath30 is much smaller than @xmath31 and is closer to the experimental data .",
    "in the single holon condensation scenario , two kinds of vortices are allowed , @xmath1 and @xmath8 .",
    "studies show that the energy of the latter is much smaller , so it should be more stable and visible in experiments . in experiments however , only @xmath1 vortices have been observed @xcite .",
    "absence of @xmath8 vortices , challenges the assumption of single holon condensation in cuprates . in the holon pair condensation scenario",
    "we always obtain @xmath1 vortices from both @xmath32 or @xmath33 order parameters .",
    "this in fact reflects the @xmath19 structure of our theory .",
    "another important limitation of the single holon condensation scenario , is the calculation of the linear temperature coefficient of the superfluid density .",
    "this scenario predicts a parabolic doping dependence behavior , while experimentally it has a weak dependence on the doping percentage @xcite .",
    "the reason is that within this assumption , the current carried by quasiparticles is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the fermi velocity of nodal quasiparticles and @xmath36 ( see appendix d for details ) .",
    "since holons are charged particles , they couple to both the external gauge field ( @xmath37 ) , and the induced internal gauge field @xmath38 . within single holon condensation scenario and using ioffe - larkin formula , it can be shown that when both spinons and holons condense , we have @xmath39 . since spinons are electrically neutral , they only couple to the internal gauge field and therefore they see @xmath40 , so their effective electric charge is @xmath41 .",
    "now we can estimate the value of @xmath42 by computing the green s function of real electrons . in the single holon condensation scenario ,",
    "the diagonal part of the green s does not respond to the gauge field , because it depends on @xmath43 .",
    "therefore only spinons couple to internal gauge field which is by factor of @xmath44 smaller and this is why @xmath45 in this case . in the pair condensation scheme , since @xmath46 , the diagonal part of holons green s function depends on @xmath47 .",
    "so it responds to the external as well as the internal gauge field . from convolution",
    "it can be checked that the real electrons respond to the whole external electromagnetic field and there quasiparticles have effective charge @xmath48 ( see appendix d for details ) .",
    "so we obtain @xmath49 in this case , in consistent with the linear temperature coefficient of superfluid density measurements .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have investigated the isotope effect on the superfluid density and the transition temperature of the superconducting phase by considering the effect of electron phonon interaction and have achieved a good agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "it is worth mentioning that boson gas in a purely attractive potential is unstable .",
    "it collapses and phase separation happens in that case .",
    "however in our model , we deal with holons which are hardcore bosons , _",
    "i.e. _ there is an infinite on - site repulsion between them .",
    "the phonon mediated attraction is also screened by the presence of spinons .",
    "these two can make the paired state of holons stable .",
    "we speculate that under some certain conditions , holons may become meta - stable and form stripes due to the phonon mediated attraction .",
    "moreover as we mentioned earlier , the phase segregation saves the kinetic energy of holes and exchange energy of spinons .",
    "this can further stabilize stripe order phase .",
    "therefore , the phonon mediated attraction between holons may enhance the stripe formation .",
    "in this paper , we have extended the anderson theory of high @xmath11 to take phonons into consideration .",
    "phonons are engaged in the pairing mechanism by mediating attractive interaction between charged spinless quasiparticles ( holons ) .",
    "this attraction destabilizes the single holon condensation state and gives rise to the paired holon state . assuming the paired holon phase immediately resolves several limitations of the u(1 ) slave treatment of the anderson theory .",
    "first of all , we achieve a better estimation of the superconducting transition temperature .",
    "moreover , since both spinons and holons are paired , we only find @xmath1 vortices .",
    "finally we showed that the effective electric charge of nodal quasiparticles is @xmath41 when we have single holon condensation , so they carry @xmath50 current , while the the effective electric charge of nodal quasiparticles is @xmath48 and they carry @xmath51 when holons condense in pairs .",
    "we have shown that in the latter case , the linear temperature coefficient of the superfluid density is almost independent of doping , consistent with experimental observations .",

    "lee b. swingle , e. hudson , m. f. maghrebi , n. dehmamy , r. flint and in particular p.a .",
    "i thank p.w .",
    "anderson for reading preliminary manuscript of this work in its early stages .",
    "i acknowledge the clarifying remark by s. kivelson about the stripe models .",
    "in the following , we provide detailed derivations of formulae in the main text concerning the expression for @xmath0 , ioffe - larkin formula and linear temperature coefficient of superfluid density . in appendix",
    "a , we provide a brief introduction to the slave boson method . in appendix b",
    ", we derive an expression for the transition temperature of the superconducting state . in appendix c",
    ", we derive ioffe larkin formula which serves an a powerful tool in relating physical quantities to the corresponding properties of the slave particles . in appendix d",
    ", we present an argument to calculate the linear temperature coefficient of the superfluid density .",
    "let us start from the t - j model as our starting point .",
    "it is believed that this hamiltonian captures the essential physics of the strongly correlated systems .",
    "we finally add the holstein hamiltonian to take the effect of electron phonon interaction into consideration .",
    "t - j model is defined as the following    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is the gutzwiller projection operator that removes doubly occupied states . within the slave boson formalism",
    ", electrons can be decomposed as @xmath54 along with the physical constraint on each site : @xmath55 which implements the gutzwiller projection .",
    "@xmath56 particles are fermions and we call them spinon and @xmath57 particles are bosons and we call them holon",
    ". spinon corresponds to a state with only one electron and holon to an empty site .",
    "the definition of the projected electron operator along with the constraint , says that we have always one slave particle per site and two slave particles can not sit on the same site . on the other hand ,",
    "whenever @xmath12 acts on an empty site , it annihilates one holon and creates a spinon with spin @xmath58 .",
    "we can not act further on the resulting state by @xmath59 , since this operator has to kill a holon , but there is no holon anymore at that site .",
    "if we act @xmath60 on a site that contains a spinon with spin @xmath58 , the operators annihilates the spinon and creates a holon at that site .",
    "so by acting projected electron operator we always annihilate one type of slave particle and create another one and therefore the number of slave particles at each site is conserved .",
    "now we can rewrite the t - j model in terms of the new slave particles . within meanfield approximation and by using hubbard - stratonovic transformation , we can decouple spinons ( spin sector ) from holons ( charge sector ) and we obtain the following effective hamiltonians for each sector    @xmath61    where the following notations have been used    @xmath62    at low temperatures , most of holons occupy the groundstate with momentum @xmath63 , therefore @xmath64 .",
    "this model has been extensively studied in the literature and it is well known that this model leads to the d - wave pairing symmetry for spinons @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath65 and @xmath66 .    now let us consider the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "since the typical energy of electrons is around @xmath18 and is much larger than @xmath67 , we can apply the bcs theory in our case . within bcs theory , electron phonon interaction ,",
    "leads to the following pairing term :    @xmath68    by translating the above term to the slave boson language in real space , and using the mean - field approximation , we can substitute @xmath69 by the following terms :    @xmath70    where @xmath71 ( doping ) . now assuming a very short range interaction , we obtain the following effective interaction :    @xmath72    in which @xmath73 and @xmath74 is the bare electron phonon interaction coupling constant , and @xmath27 is the energy of optical phonons .",
    "let us assume that @xmath75 , so we can neglect this phonon mediated pairing term and therefore , the d - wave nature of the spinons does not change .",
    "from the above we see that the coupling constant of phonon mediated spinon spinon attraction is renormalized by @xmath76 factor and that of holons by @xmath77 due to strong correlation effects .",
    "it is easy to show that , @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the electron phonon coupling constant .",
    "therefore , we can interpret these renormalization factors as the renormalization of the coupling constant of spinon - phonon interaction to @xmath80 and that of holon - phonon interaction to @xmath81 . in appendix c , using ioffe - larkin recombination formula , we present another physical argument to justify this result .",
    "now let us focus on the charge sector ( holons ) .",
    "we have studied the effect of holon - phonon interaction on the holon mass in ref . @xcite .",
    "since we treat charge sector as a bose gas , we have shown the holon - phonon interaction is in the non - adiabatic limit and the small polaron picture can be applied .",
    "the mass of holons enhances by an exponential factor and we have : @xmath82 , where @xmath83 .",
    "taking the mentioned mass renormalization into account , the following continuum model describes the low energy physics of holons : @xmath84    where @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath23 .",
    "it has been shown that in 2d , no matter how small @xmath87 is , we have a bound state of bosons and then the double condensation is energetically favorable . using the bogoliubov transformation , we can find the energy eigenvalue which is @xmath88 and the energy eigenvectors . on the other hand , we should choose @xmath89 such that @xmath90 .",
    "the two mentioned constraints lead to the following self - consistency equations :    @xmath91    in which @xmath92 is the bose einstein distribution function .",
    "the first constraint can be solved exactly by @xmath93 , where @xmath94 .",
    "after integration we obtain : @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 . at @xmath98",
    "we always have @xmath99 in consistent with hugenholtz - pines theorem . for small values of @xmath87",
    ", we have :    @xmath100    which is diminishing very rapidly and we can neglect it up to the first order approximation .",
    "therefore , at small enough temperature energy excitations are sound - like an are of the form @xmath101 where @xmath102 . at @xmath103 , @xmath104 and",
    "therefore @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "the second constraint can be written in the following way :    @xmath107    using the paired state and assuming gapless excitations ( @xmath108 ) , we can show that up to the first order , @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is the ground - state macroscopic occupation number ( condensation fraction ) , though @xmath111 .",
    "if we replace every operator by minus itself the effective hamiltonian and all order parameters remain the same , and therefore we have @xmath19 gauge freedom and the low energy theory is described by a @xmath19 gauge theory . as long as @xmath112 ,",
    "the condensation fraction is nonzero and @xmath98 , @xmath113 , where @xmath10 is doping ( number of holons ) .",
    "one important question that should be addressed is how to relate the physical quantities to the corresponding quantities of spinons and holons ?",
    "for example , given the conductivity of spinons and holons , what is the conductivity of real electrons ? to answer this question we should note two things .",
    "first of all , since at each site we should have one slave particle , therefore if one spinons hops from site @xmath114 to site @xmath115 , it should be accompanied by a hopping of one holons from site @xmath115 to site @xmath114 .",
    "so we conclude that the current carried by spinons is equal but opposite to the current carried by holons and they add up to zero . since electron operator at site",
    "@xmath114 with spin @xmath58 , is written in terms of slave particles as @xmath15 , it is invariant under u(1 ) gauge transformation , provided spinons and holons carry the same charge under this transformation . on the other hand , we assume spinons to be electrically neutral and assign @xmath116 electric charge to holons ( we could also assume neutral holons and assign @xmath48 electric charge to spinons ) . by scaling the internal gauge field we can assume @xmath117 . as we discussed we should satisfy the following constraint    @xmath118    [ eq20 ]    since only holons carry electric charge we have    @xmath119    above two equations tells us that nonzero external gauge field ( electromagnetic field ) induces internal gauge field . because we have    @xmath120    solving eq .",
    "[ 19 ]    @xmath121    and as a result @xmath122 .",
    "equivalently    @xmath123    now let us consider two important cases .",
    "fermi liquid phase and the superconducting phase .      in the fermi liquid ( fl ) phase",
    ", holons are condensed but spinons are not .",
    "so we have @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "since in this case , @xmath126 , we have @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 .",
    "now let us define the effective electric charge of spinons and holons as    @xmath130    therefore in the fermi liquid we have @xmath131 and therefore they have nonzero overlap with physical electrons and carry the same charge . on the other hand @xmath132 and we can safely assume that holons are electrically neutral in the fl phase .",
    "this can bee directly seen from @xmath133 .",
    "one important result of this argument is that in the absence of the pseudogap ( _ i.e. _ when @xmath134 ) , condensed holons do not couple to phonons , since phonons only couple to electrically charged quasiparticles . in other words ,",
    "phonons create local electromagnetic field and this field induces another ( internal ) gauge field .",
    "holons couple to the sum of these two fields .",
    "when @xmath134 , but holons condense ( _ i.e. _ at low enough temperatures ) these two fields cancel out each other and as a result holons do not couple to phonons .      in the superconducting ( sc )",
    "phase , both holons and spinons are condensed .",
    "so we have @xmath135 and @xmath136 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath137 , where @xmath138 and @xmath139 is the condensation fraction of holon and spinon gas respectively .",
    "at zero temperature all holons and spinons condense and therefore @xmath140 and we have @xmath141 , @xmath142 , and @xmath143 .",
    "we can compute the effective charge of spinons and holons and we obtain @xmath144 and @xmath145 respectively . therefore in the superconducting state , spinons only respond to the @xmath10 fraction of the electromagnetic field .",
    "since holons are effectively charged quasiparticles in this state , ( or since the internal gauge field does not cancel out the local electromagnetic field of phonons completely ) they couple to phonons .",
    "the larger pseudogap value , the stronger interaction between holons and phonons .",
    "this is an intuitive way to justify our recipe for renormalization of the electron phonon coupling constant from the brae value @xmath79 , to the effective value @xmath146 . using this expression and since @xmath147 decreases with doping",
    ", we can easily explain why the isotope effect is a decreasing function of doping as well .",
    "moreover , in the overdoped region , @xmath125 at the transition temperature and therefore holons do not interact with phonons and as a result we do not expect isotope effect on the @xmath0 .",
    "however at @xmath98 , @xmath136 even in the overdoped region and the mass of holons enhances in an isotope dependent way and this explains the nonvanishing isotope effect on the superfluid density and the london penetration depth in this region .",
    "another important limitation of the single holon condensation scenario , is the calculation of the linear temperature coefficient of the superfluid density .",
    "this scenario predicts a parabolic doping dependence behavior , while experimentally it has a weak dependence on the doping percentage @xcite .",
    "the reason is that within this assumption , the current carried by quasiparticles is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the fermi velocity of nodal quasiparticles and @xmath36 .",
    "lee and wen have shown that the linear temperature dependence of a d - wave superconductor is given by the following expression      where @xmath149 is the velocity of the d - wave sc quasiparticles in the direction perpendicular to @xmath35 .",
    "now let us give a simple argument on how to compute @xmath42 .",
    "since holons are charged particles , they couple to both the external gauge field ( @xmath37 ) , and the induced internal gauge field @xmath38 . within single holon condensation scenario and using ioffe - larkin formula , it can be shown that when both spinons and holons condense , we have @xmath39 . since spinons are electrically neutral , they only couple to the internal gauge field and therefore they see @xmath40 , so their effective electric charge is @xmath41 .",
    "now we can estimate the value of @xmath42 by computing the green s function of real electrons .",
    "green s function can be calculated by convoluting the green s function of holons with that of spinons . within the single holon condensation scenario @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the condensation fraction of holon gas .",
    "this expression means that the physical quasiparticles only response to the induced internal field @xmath39 , and therefore their effective electric charge is @xmath41",
    ". therefore they carry @xmath50 current and this leads to @xmath45 . on the other hand , in the double condensation scenario , as it has been discussed by lee and wen @xcite",
    ", we have @xmath152 .",
    "therefore , in this case , quasiparticles see the whole external field and we obtain @xmath49 in consistent with the linear temperature coefficient of superfluid density measurements .",
    "let us do more serious calculations now . in the pair condensed scenario ,",
    "since @xmath153 holons per lattice site condense at the ground state with energy @xmath154 ( which we showed before is exponentially small ) , we can write the diagonal part of the holons green s function as        now let us choose the coulomb gauge in which @xmath158 and @xmath159 . since holons are charged quasiparticles , they couple to the both internal and external gauge fields .",
    "since we have assumed pair condensation , the diagonal part of green s function responds to the gauge fields and we have @xmath160    in the presence of the gauge field only the diagonal part of the spinons green s function responds to the gauge field and the off - diagonal part does not change . since spinons are electrically neutral , they only couple to the internal gauge field @xmath161            which clearly implies that the effective charge of quasiparticles is @xmath48 and therefore they carry @xmath51 current , not @xmath50 .",
    "so we conclude that in the pair condensation scenario , quasiparticles carry the whole current and therefore @xmath49 in this case .    in the single condensation scenario ,",
    "the diagonal part of the holons green s function is also @xmath165 .",
    "however the first term does not respond to the gauge field , like the offdiagonal part of the electrons green s function and we have @xmath166 .",
    "after convolution it can be verified that the coherent part of the real electrons green s function is @xmath167 . in the previous section we showed that in the sc state and at very low temperatures , @xmath168 , so we have @xmath169 .",
    "this results @xmath45 and therefore quasiparticles carry only @xmath10 fraction of the @xmath51 current .",
    "so the single holon condensation scenario gives @xmath9 dependence for the linear temperature dependence of the superfluid density , which is far from experimental observations ."

    "<S> both of these are required in this approach to obtain the superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> this approach resolves three limitations of the u(1 ) slave boson method . </S>",
    "<S> we achieve a better estimation of @xmath0 , we only predict @xmath1 vortices and the linear @xmath2 coefficient of the superfluid is not sensitive to the doping . this formalism provides a framework that connects anderson s idea of preformed cooper pairs and phonon based theories . </S>"
