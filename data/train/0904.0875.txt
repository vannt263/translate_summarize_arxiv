    "homogeneous nucleation during condensation of supersaturated vapors is a well - studied topic ; however , it is not yet fully understood despite its general importance .",
    "the most widespread modeling approach is still the classical nucleation theory ( cnt ) @xcite .",
    "cnt is an acceptable approximation for some simple fluids but may yield huge deviations compared to experimental data in other cases @xcite .",
    "an important source of error is the assumption that the emerging liquid has the same thermodynamic properties as the bulk liquid phase @xcite .",
    "condensation processes of practical interest , e.g.  in atmospheric science , are usually heterogeneous or ion - induced and have a more complex mechanism of nucleation @xcite .",
    "however , to adequately describe such processes a thorough understanding of the homogeneous case is a prerequisite .",
    "experimental methods for studying homogeneous nucleation face considerable challenges : experimentally , a homogeneous system without walls or other irregularities can at best be approximated , a difficulty that is absent in molecular simulation .",
    "furthermore , the experimentally accessible range of the nucleation rate @xmath2 is limited to comparatively slow processes that are relatively far from the spinodal @xcite .",
    "experimental data on the critical nucleus size have only recently become available @xcite . in molecular simulation ,",
    "homogeneous nucleation can straightforwardly be studied by a direct approach where a supersaturated vapor is observed for some time interval , the emerging nuclei are counted , and their size is evaluated @xcite . due to the limitations in computational power ,",
    "accessible system size and time interval are limited .",
    "thus the direct approach can currently only be applied to vapors at high supersaturations , where nucleation occurs within nanoseconds .    for systems at lower supersaturation",
    "it is necessary to follow other , more indirect approaches , e.g.  by simulating other ensembles or related systems instead of nucleation in the supersaturated phase itself , which occurs too slowly .",
    "key quantities determined from such indirect simulations are the size of the critical nucleus @xmath3 and its gibbs energy of formation @xmath4 , and methods based on transition path sampling also permit a study of kinetic aspects @xcite . both molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation with inserted nuclei in nonequilibrium with the surrounding supersaturated phase @xcite or based on transition path sampling @xcite and monte carlo ( mc ) simulation @xcite were used for such purposes in the past .    in the present work ,",
    "both the direct and an indirect simulation approach were applied to validate two versions of cnt and to develop a new surface property corrected ( spc ) modification of cnt .",
    "a simple model fluid was chosen , where the intermolecular interactions are described by the lennard - jones ( lj ) potential , truncated and shifted at an intermolecular distance @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the small cutoff radius leads to relatively fast simulations and avoids long - range corrections that are hard to estimate for inhomogeneous systems @xcite .",
    "the truncated and shifted lj potential ( ljts ) defines an important and well studied model fluid that can be used to describe noble gases and methane very accurately",
    ". a considerable amount of thermodynamic data is available for it and in particular , the dependence of the surface tension on curvature has been quantified @xcite .",
    "to describe homogeneous nucleation during condensation , a supersaturated vapor in a volume @xmath6 at the temperature @xmath7 and a pressure @xmath8 which is larger than the saturated vapor pressure @xmath9 is considered .",
    "the quotient @xmath10 is called the supersaturation of the vapor ( with respect to pressure ) . starting from a homogeneous vapor with @xmath11 ,",
    "nanoscopic droplets begin to form after some induction time as dispersed nuclei of the emerging liquid phase .",
    "they assume a specific size distribution , and the critical nucleus size @xmath3 is the number of particles @xmath12 where the gibbs energy of nucleus formation @xmath13 has its maximal value @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the size of the critical nucleus and its energy of formation were discussed by gibbs @xcite from a theoretical standpoint . given that the number of nuclei with @xmath12 particles is usually determined in cnt by applying a factor of @xmath14 to the number of monomers , an internally consistent approach @xcite leads to the expression @xmath15 here , @xmath16 is the surface free energy of a nucleus with @xmath12 particles ; @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the chemical potentials of the saturated and the supersaturated vapor . in expression ( [ eqn : deltagn ] ) a negative volume contribution competes with a positive surface contribution .",
    "the difference between the chemical potentials can be determined from an integral over the pressure along the isotherm of the metastable vapor @xmath19 volmer and weber @xcite approximated the nucleation rate by @xmath20 the preexponential coefficient is @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 represents the surface area of a critical nucleus , @xmath23 the number of monomers constituting the vapor , @xmath24 is the zeldovich factor , and @xmath25 is the mass of a particle .",
    "furthermore , @xmath26 is the thermal nonaccommodation factor which is calculated from the energy released on addition of a monomer to a critical nucleus above that needed to maintain the existing temperature @xcite @xmath27 and the kinetic energy variance @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the bulk enthalpy of vaporization and @xmath30 is the isochoric heat capacity of the vapor @xcite .",
    "cnt is based on the capillarity approximation : the density of a nucleus is assumed to be the bulk saturated liquid density @xmath31 and its surface tension @xmath32 to be the surface tension of the planar interface @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "nuclei are assumed to be spherical , thus for one containing @xmath12 particles the surface area is @xmath34 .",
    "the surface free energy is related to the surface tension by @xmath35 .",
    "the capillarity approximation implies @xmath36 .",
    "an analysis of experimental results presented by fenelonov _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite seems to suggest that for some fluids , the surface tension of small nuclei deviates from @xmath33 only by factors between 0.92 and 1.14 .",
    "their line of argument is based on the so - called first fundamental nucleation theorem @xcite @xmath37 according to which the size of the critical nucleus is obtained from the supersaturation dependence of the nucleation rate at constant temperature .",
    "this value of @xmath3 is then inserted into the kelvin equation @xmath38{{\\ensuremath{{{\\ensuremath{\\mathnormal{n}}}}^\\star } } } } ,     \\label{eqn : kelvin}\\ ] ] a corollary of standard cnt , to obtain the surface tension of the critical nucleus .",
    "however , the kelvin equation does not take any dependence of @xmath32 on @xmath12 into account .",
    "hence , it is inconsistent to use this equation for quantifying precisely this size dependence .",
    "the nucleation theorem as given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : nucthe ] ) assumes @xmath39 , which is a bad approximation at high temperatures , in particular near the spinodal line .",
    "furthermore , it neglects the dependence of the preexponential coefficient @xmath40 from eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : vw ] ) and ( [ eqn : feder ] ) on @xmath3 , although @xmath40 is actually proportional to both @xmath8 and the surface area of the critical nucleus ( cf .",
    "schmelzer @xcite for valid forms of the nucleation theorem ) .    from theoretical considerations @xcite and simulations",
    "@xcite it can be inferred that the surface tension for interfaces with a high curvature is actually much lower .",
    "an approximation of the size dependence of the surface tension was given by tolman @xcite @xmath41 where @xmath42 is called the tolman length and @xmath43 is the radius of the nucleus .",
    "laaksonen , ford , and kulmala ( lfk ) @xcite also proposed a size dependent specific surface energy @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are determined from thermal properties .",
    "this modification leads to predictions which were found to agree better with simulation data of tanaka _ et al . _",
    "@xcite than standard cnt . in the lfk model ,",
    "the curvature effect is covered by the single parameter @xmath45 , since @xmath13 does not depend on @xmath46 .",
    "phase coexistence methods are an established approach for obtaining equilibrium data from molecular simulation @xcite . in the present indirect simulation approach ,",
    "a single nucleus in equilibrium with a supersaturated vapor was studied in the canonical ensemble . for such simulations",
    "it is crucial to choose the relation of the number of particles in the nucleus to the total number of particles in the system appropriately .",
    "the liquid fraction must be relatively large so that changes in nucleus size significantly affect the density of the surrounding vapor and the nucleus can not evaporate completely because the vapor density increases . eventually , an equilibrium is established , where the nucleus contains @xmath12 particles while the vapor reaches a supersaturated pressure @xmath47 .",
    "farkas @xcite pointed out that for a system with @xmath48 particles composed of a nucleus containing @xmath12 and a supersaturated vapor containing @xmath49 particles , an equilibrium between the nucleus and the supersaturated vapor corresponds to the condition @xmath50 .",
    "this is due to the fact that by definition , the gibbs energy of nucleus formation is maximal for @xmath51 and thus @xmath52 holds , which implies that for @xmath50 , growth and decay are equally probable . since in a nucleation process",
    "@xmath13 has a single maximum @xcite , this equilibrium condition uniquely identifies the size of the critical nucleus . by minimizing the helmholtz energy of the system in an @xmath53 simulation , an equilibrium that characterizes the maximum of its gibbs energy",
    "is established .",
    "the critical nucleus model of reguera - reiss nucleation theory @xcite reproduces these considerations in an explicit form .    as suggested by lovett @xcite",
    ", the fact that a critical nucleus can only be in ( stable ) equilibrium with a supersaturated vapour in a system with a finite ( small ) volume makes these small systems where the thermodynamic analysis is straightforward and the configurations are easily simulated an attractive topic for molecular simulation .",
    "such an approach leads to more accurate data on the critical nucleus , e.g.  its size @xmath3 or surface tension @xmath54 , than the usual method of observing growth and decay of nuclei in nonequilibrium simulations @xcite , because it permits straightforward sampling over a large number of time steps .",
    "it is also computationally efficient since only small systems are considered .",
    "the molecular simulation of such equilibria is not a novelty in itself @xcite , but no implications for critical nuclei were drawn from these studies in the past .",

    "the lfk model , which depends on the supersaturated vapor pressure , was evaluated at @xmath57 , 2.28 , 1.62 , and 1.17 for @xmath58 , 0.70 , 0.80 , and 0.95 @xmath59 , respectively .",
