    "the flux of cosmic rays is summarized in fig.1a , b@xcite .",
    "the energy spectrum follows a broken power law .",
    "the two power laws are separated by a feature referred to as the  knee \" ; see fig.1a .",
    "there is evidence that cosmic rays , up to several eev , originate in galactic sources .",
    "this correlation disappears in the vicinity of a second feature in the spectrum dubbed the  ankle \" . above the ankle ,",
    "the gyroradius of a proton exceeds the size of the galaxy and it is generally assumed that we are witnessing the onset of an extragalactic component in the spectrum that extends to energies beyond 100eev .",
    "experiments indicate that the highest energy cosmic rays are predominantly protons . above a threshold of 50 eev",
    "these protons interact with cmbr photons and therefore lose their energy to pions before reaching our detectors .",
    "this limits their sources to tens of mpc , the so - called greissen - zatsepin - kuzmin cutoff .",
    "models for the origin of the highest energy cosmic rays fall into two categories , top - down and bottom - up . in top - down models",
    "it is assumed that the cosmic rays are the decay products of cosmological remnants with grand unified energy scale @xmath2 .",
    "these models predict neutrino fluxes most likely within reach of amanda , and certainly icecube .",
    "in bottom - up scenarios it is assumed that cosmic rays originate in cosmic accelerators .",
    "accelerating particles to tev energy and above requires massive bulk flows of relativistic charged particles .",
    "these are likely to originate from the exceptional gravitational forces in the vicinity of black holes .",
    "examples include the dense cores of exploding stars , inflows onto supermassive black holes at the centers of active galaxies and annihilating black holes or neutron stars . before leaving the source ,",
    "accelerated particles pass through intense radiation fields or dense clouds of gas surrounding the black hole .",
    "this results in interactions producing pions decaying into secondary photons and neutrinos that accompany the primary cosmic ray beam as illustrated in fig.2 .",
    "how many neutrinos are produced in association with the cosmic ray beam ?",
    "the answer to this question , among many others@xcite , provides the rationale for building kilometer - scale neutrino detectors .",
    "we first consider a neutrino beam produced at an accelerator laboratory ; see fig.2 . here",
    "the target absorbs all parent protons as well as the muons , electrons and gamma rays produced . a pure neutrino beam exits the dump .",
    "if nature constructed such a  hidden source \" in the heavens , conventional astronomy will not reveal it .",
    "it can not be the source of the cosmic rays , however , because the dump would have to be partially transparent to protons .",
    "the extreme opposite case is a  transparent source \" where the accelerated proton interacts once and escapes the dump after producing photons as well as neutrinos .",
    "elementary particle physics is now sufficient to relate all particle fluxes because a fraction ( 1/6 to 1/2 depending on the energy ) of the interacting proton goes into pion production .",
    "this energy is equally shared between gamma rays and neutrinos , of which one half are muon - neutrinos .",
    "therefore , at most one quarter of the energy ends up in muon - neutrinos compared to cosmic rays .",
    "the flux of a transparent cosmic ray source is often referred to as the waxman - bahcall flux@xcite .",
    "it is easy to derive and the derivation is revealing .",
    "fig.1b shows a fit to the observed cosmic ray spectrum assuming an extragalactic component fitted above the  ankle \" .",
    "the energy content of this component is @xmath3 , assuming an @xmath4 energy spectrum with a gzk cutoff .",
    "the power required to generate this energy density in the hubble time of @xmath5years is @xmath6 per ( mpc)@xmath7 .",
    "this works out to@xcite    *  @xmath8 per galaxy , *  @xmath9 per cluster of galaxies , *  @xmath10 per active galaxy , or *  @xmath11erg per cosmological gamma ray burst .",
    "the coincidence between these numbers and the observed electromagnetic energy output of these sources explains why they have emerged as the leading candidates for the cosmic ray accelerators .",
    "the coincidence is consistent with the relationship between cosmic rays and photons built into the  transparent \" source previously introduced .",
    "the relationship can be extended to neutrinos .",
    "assuming the same energy density of @xmath12 in neutrinos with a spectrum @xmath13 that continues up to a maximum energy @xmath14 , the neutrino flux follows from @xmath15 . for @xmath16 and @xmath17gev ,",
    "the generic source of the highest energy cosmic rays produces 50 detected muon neutrinos per km@xmath18 per year@xcite .",
    "[ here we have folded the predicted flux with the probability that the neutrino is actually detected given by@xcite the ratio of the muon and neutrino interaction lengths in ice , @xmath19 . ]",
    "the number depends weakly on @xmath14 and @xmath20 .",
    "a similar analysis can be performed for galactic sources@xcite .",
    "as previously stated , for one interaction and only one , the neutrino flux should be reduced by a factor @xmath21 .",
    "on the other hand , there are more cosmic rays in the universe producing neutrinos than observed at earth because of the gzk - effect .",
    "the diffuse muon neutrino flux associated with the highest energy cosmic rays is estimated to be @xmath22 , to be compared to the sensitivity achieved with the first 3 years of the completed amanda detector of @xmath23 .",
    "the analysis has not been completed but a limit has been published that is 5 times larger obtained with data taken with the partially deployed detector in 1997@xcite . on the other hand , after three years of operation icecube will reach a diffuse flux limit of @xmath24 .",
    "while it has been realized for many decades that the case for neutrino astronomy is compelling , the challenge has been to develop a reliable , expandable and affordable detector technology to build the kilometer - scale telescopes required to do the science . conceptually , the technique is simple . in the case of a high - energy muon neutrino , for instance",
    ", the neutrino interacts with a hydrogen or oxygen nucleus in deep ocean water and produces a muon travelling in nearly the same direction as the neutrino .",
    "the blue cerenkov light emitted along the muon s kilometer - long trajectory is detected by strings of photomultiplier tubes deployed at depth shielded from radiation .",
    "the orientation of the cerenkov cone reveals the neutrino direction .",
    "the amanda detector , using natural 1 mile deep antarctic ice as a cerenkov detector , has operated for more than 3 years in its final configuration of 680 optical modules on 19 strings .",
    "the detector is in steady operation collecting roughly four neutrinos per day using fast on - line analysis software .",
    "its performance has been calibrated by reconstructing muons produced by atmospheric muon neutrinos@xcite .    using the first of 3 years of amandaii data , the amanda collaboration is performing a ( blind ) search for the emission of muon neutrinos from spatially localized directions in the northern sky@xcite . only the year",
    "2000 data have been unblinded .",
    "the skyplot is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : skyplot ] .",
    "90% upper limits on the fluency of point sources is at the level of @xmath25 or @xmath26 , averaged over declination .",
    "this corresponds to a flux of @xmath27 integrated above 10gev .",
    "the most significant excess is 8 events observed on an expected background of 2.1 , occurring at approximately 68 deg n dec , 21.1 hr r.a ; for details see ref .",
    "@xcite . unblinding the data collected in 2001 , 2002 may reveal sources or confirm the consistency of the year 2000 skyplot with statistical fluctuations on the atmospheric neutrino background .",
    ", width=480 ]    with this search the amandaii detector has reached a high - energy effective telescope area of 25,000@xmath2840,000m@xmath18 , depending on declination .",
    "this represents an interesting milestone : sources with an @xmath4 spectrum should be observed provided the number of gamma rays and neutrinos are roughly equal as expected from cosmic ray accelerators producing pions@xcite .",
    "overall , amanda represents a proof of concept for the kilometer - scale neutrino observatory , icecube@xcite , now under construction .",
    "icecube will consist of 80 kilometer - length strings , each instrumented with 60 10-inch photomultipliers spaced by 17  m. the deepest module is 2.4  km below the surface .",
    "the strings are arranged at the apexes of equilateral triangles 125 m on a side .",
    "the instrumented ( not effective ! ) detector volume is a cubic kilometer .",
    "a surface air shower detector , icetop , consisting of 160 auger - style cerenkov detectors deployed over 1km@xmath29 above icecube , augments the deep - ice component by providing a tool for calibration , background rejection and air - shower physics , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the transmission of analogue photomultiplier signals from the deep ice to the surface , used in amanda , has been abandoned .",
    "the photomultiplier signals will be captured and digitized inside the optical module .",
    "the digitized signals are given a global time stamp with a precision of @xmath30ns and transmitted to the surface .",
    "the digital messages are sent to a string processor , a global event trigger and an event builder .",
    "construction of the detector is expected to commence in the austral summer of 2004/2005 and continue for 6 years , possibly less .",
    "the growing detector will take data during construction , with each string coming online within days of deployment .",
    "the data streams of icecube , and amandaii , embedded inside icecube , will be merged off - line using gps timestamps .",
    "icecube will offer great advantages over amandaii beyond its larger size : it will have a higher efficiency and superior angular resolution in reconstructing tracks , map showers from electron- and tau - neutrinos ( events where both the production and decay of a @xmath31 produced by a @xmath32 can be identified ) and , most importantly , measure neutrino energy .",
    "simulations , backed by amanda data , indicate that the direction of muons can be determined with sub - degree accuracy and their energy measured to better than 30% in the logarithm of the energy .",
    "the direction of showers will be reconstructed to better than 10@xmath33 above 10tev and the response in energy is linear and better than 20% .",
    "energy resolution is critical because , once one establishes that the energy exceeds 1pev , there is no atmospheric muon or neutrino background in a kilometer - square detector and full sky coverage of the telescope is achieved .",
    "the background counting rate of icecube signals is expected to be less than 0.5khz per optical sensor . in this low background environment",
    ", icecube can detect the excess of anti-@xmath34 events from a galactic supernova .",
