    "the search for extrasolar planets has revealed that there are many terrestrial planets out of our solar system ( e.g. , lger et al .",
    "2009 ) . by detecting these extrasolar terrestrial planets ,",
    "many researches have tried to determine the planets thermal and orbital histories ( henning et al .",
    "2009 ; barnes et al . 2010 ; lger et al . 2011 ; wagner et al . 2012 ) .",
    "the thermal and orbital states of extrasolar terrestrial planets are important for the planets evolution .",
    "in addition , the thermal and orbital states affect the habitability , making analysis of these factors of key importance .",
    "recently , in the search for habitable extrasolar planets , m stars were suggested for observation ( scalo et al .",
    "2007 ) because the number of m stars is much larger than that of g stars .",
    "conventionally , m stars are not considered to be likely hosts of habitable planets because their planets orbits are too close , which results in the planets being tidally rocked ( synchronously rotated ) and their atmosphere freezing on the dark side",
    ". however , joshi et al . (",
    "1997 ) hypothesized that carbon dioxide can make a planet habitable .",
    "thus , the importance of m star extrasolar planet analysis continues to increase .",
    "focusing on the terrestrial planets in our solar system , the main heat sources are the insolation from the sun and the radioactive decay in the planets themselves . however",
    ", if extrasolar planets orbit around small stars such as an m star , the tidal heating has a significant effect on the habitability .",
    "compared with the sun , m stars have low temperatures , and thus the magnitude of the insolation becomes low .",
    "therefore , the habitable zone is closer to the star .",
    "the rate of change of a planet s orbit due to tidal dissipation increases with decreasing orbital distance .",
    "for this reason , a planet orbiting an m star may not be able to stay within the habitable zone for a long time .",
    "in addition , assuming that the planets orbit according to kepler s law , the tidal frequency is high , producing tidal heating that may exceed the radiogenic and insolation heating .",
    "in contrast to the terrestrial planets in our solar system , such tidal heating is an important factor for the thermal and orbital evolutions of planets orbiting m stars .",
    "the effects of tidal heating on terrestrial planets orbiting m stars have been analyzed ( jackson et al . 2008 ; barnes et al . 2008 ) .",
    "although these researches revealed that tidal heating influences a planet habitability , they assumed that the magnitude of the dissipation of the planet is constant .",
    "the tidal heating mechanism is complicated and interacts with the internal thermal state and orbit of the planet ( e.g. , hussmann & spohn 2004 ) .",
    "when a planet is tidally heated , structure and thermal states of the planet changes , which affects the tidal heating by the feed - back .",
    "in addition , the orbit and heating rates also interact with each other .",
    "tidal heat dissipation is dependent on the eccentricity of the orbit ; the eccentricity decreases with heating rate because orbital energy is lost as tidal heat .",
    "thus , tidal heating should be coupled with orbital and thermal evolution .    in this work",
    ", we evaluate the coupled calculation of tidal heating considering the thermal and orbital states .",
    "however , coupled calculations are very complex . in addition",
    ", the internal structure of extrasolar terrestrial planets is not constrained well .",
    "thus , as a fist step , we consider a martian - sized terrestrial planet .",
    "an advantage of this choice is that the internal pressure of planets of this size is small compared with earth - sized planets , due to their small radii , which allows a simple model of the internal structure to be used",
    ". a martian - sized planet has been discovered ( muirhead et al . 2012 ) ; however , this planet is outside the habitable zone . despite this",
    ", we can expect similarly sized planets to be discovered within habitable zones in future observations .",
    "considering the observation , earth - sized planets are easier to detect compared to martian - sized planet .",
    "however , we try the coupling theoretical calculation with martian structure . in our solar system , io is a tidally locked rocky satellite with high tidal heating ( segatz et al .",
    "thus , we reference the thermal model of io as well as mars .",
    "if accurate internal structures of super - earths are derived in the future , we can apply the results of this work to such models with more complicated structures .",
    "in this work , for simplicity , we assume that the internal structure of the planet is composed of three layers : a liquid core , a mantle and a stagnant lid ( fig .",
    "[ structure ] a ) .",
    "stagnant lid convection occurs in the mantle . because stagnant lid convection is the most typical convection system , scaling laws which relate the magnitude of the convection to the structure have been analyzed by many researches ( e.g. , reese et al .",
    "although mobile lid convection ( e.g. , oneill & lenardic 2007 ) or heat pipe state ( moore 2001 ; moore & webb 2013 ) are suggested as alternative heat transfer mechanisms , we assume the stagnant lid convection as the heat transfer model in this work .",
    "rheology and temperature distributions depend only on the radial distance ( i.e. , are independent of latitude and longitude ) . the mantle is differentiated into three parts : two thermal boundaries and a well mixed convective section ( fig .",
    "[ structure ] b ) . at the two boundaries ,",
    "heat is transferred by conduction . in this work ,",
    "we define the lid and the upper boundary of the mantle as the lithosphere .",
    "the lithosphere is assumed to be elastic , and tidal heat is generated only in the mantle by viscoelastic dissipation ( hussmann & spohn 2004 ) .",
    "this assumption is valid because the surface temperature is less than 300 k in the habitable zone , which is much smaller than the mantle temperature ( more than 1600 k ) . in the convective part , for simplicity",
    ", we assume that convective temperature is @xmath0 and independent of depth . @xmath0",
    "changes with time both by the heating and cooling .",
    "the rate of change of the mantle and core temperatures @xmath0 and @xmath1 are calculated based on the energy balance ( breuer & spohn 2006 ) .",

    "@xmath17 is the stefan number , which accounts for the consumption or release of latent heat by the mantle ( breuer & spohn 2006 ) .",
    "@xmath17 is represented as the ratio of latent heat to the heat capacity of the mantle , and is given by    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the latent heat of the mantle ( breuer & spohn 2006 ) .",
    "@xmath20 is the * volume * melt fraction , which is discussed below .",
    "@xmath21 is the volume of the melt zone .",
    "* effect of melt in the rock has been studied by many researches ( e.g. , rosenberg & handy 2005 ) .",
    "when mantle begins to melt , melt is distributed to the frame and junctions of grain boundaries . by increasing the melt fraction ,",
    "melts among grains begin to be interconnected each other .",
    "however , as long as the melt fraction is under the critical value called the rheological critical melt percentage ( rcmp ) , grain framework is maintained ( rosenberg & handy 2005 ) .",
    "when the melt fraction exceeds the rcmp , melt covers the grain completely and effect of liquid dominates .",
    "considering these effects , if the melt fraction is under the rcmp , we assume that the convective area of the mantle is well mixed and that melt is not separated from the solid mantle ; thus , @xmath22 .",
    "* this assumption may not be valid if the melt fraction exceeds the rcmp because the generated melt segregates from the solid mantle .",
    "however , we found that melt fraction of our coupled calculation is less than the 25 % at every condition , and moore ( 2003 ) estimates that the segregation of melt occurs at the 40 % to 60 % of melt fraction .",
    "thus the assumption of mantle with partial melt state is reasonable .",
    "@xmath23 is the heating due to radioactive decay . for simplicity , we use the averaged radiogenic heating in the martian mantle estimated by grott & breuer ( 2008 b ) . the volumetric radiogenic heating @xmath24 is given by    @xmath25    where @xmath26 w m@xmath27 and @xmath28 s@xmath29 ( grott & breuer 2008 b ) .",

    "one caveat is that habitable zone itself changes with time because the luminosity of the central star changes .",
    "thus , our estimation for the stability at the habitable zone of the planet may be too rough . however , kopparapu et al .",

    "thus , the planet is predicted to have active volcanos like io , which may make the planet inhabitable .",
    "if @xmath181 is less than 0.1 , tidal heating is not enough to maintain the melt in the mantle , which results in cooling of the planet . from the coupled calculations",

    "the eccentricity does not change significantly for @xmath188 even though the q value is relatively small because the orbital distance is large , which is different from the case of a @xmath190 mass star . in the case of @xmath149 ,",
    "the orbital distance is small .",
    "however , the small rate of change of eccentricity is caused by the large @xmath157 due to the melt .    through the coupled calculations",

    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "( [ phase ] ) , the reference viscosity and initial temperature do not affect the heating states of the planet .",
    "if the mass of the star is around 0.1@xmath74 , the planet reaches a hot state when @xmath192 , independently of @xmath191 and @xmath137 . as mentioned above",
    ", the planet can stay in the habitable zone for a long time in the hot state .",
    "if the mass of the star is around 0.2m@xmath187 , a hot state occurs if @xmath193 .",
    "if @xmath84 is more than 0.3 , a hot state is not formed even though the eccentricity is quite large .",
    "the habitable zone of a star in this mass range is too far from the star for tidal heating large enough for runaway heating and melting of the mantle to occur .",
    "since the cold planet has low temperature and rigid , stars of less than @xmath194 in mass are good targets for finding habitable planets .",
    "if the tidal heating is sufficiently large , the mantle is heated and the surface heat flux exceeds the martian heat flux . in this work , we assume stagnant lid convection as a heat transport mechanism . as an alternative mechanism",
    ", plate tectonics may occur in planets in a hot state .",
    "although it is currently only possible to observe the plate tectonics of earth , it has been suggested that plate tectonics occurs in large , rocky extrasolar planets ( e.g. , valencia et al .",

    "the size of the planet may affect the stress ( valencia et al .",
    "2007 ; oneill & lenardic 2007 ) ; however , korenaga ( 2010 ) suggests that the effect of surface water is more important than the size of the planet . in our model",
    ", we do not include surface oceans and the size of the planets considered is relatively small .",
    "thus , stagnant - lid convection is more reasonable .",
    "however , in the case of mars , plate tectonics has been suggested to be the origin of the early internal dynamo ( nimmo & stevenson 2000 ) .",
    "thus , plate tectonics can not be ruled out for martian - sized extrasolar planets .",
    "delamination may be more probable in small - sized extrasolar planets than plate tectonics . in a hot state ,",
    "the melt in the mantle reduces the mantle viscosity .",
    "thus , the bottom of the stagnant lid is delaminated and absorbed into the mantle .",
    "delamination displaces the surface of the planet , which is the suggested cause of the corona of venus ( smrekar & stofan 1997 ) .",
    "thus , we can suggest that the planet is heated by tides , and the morphology of the planet is mainly a product of localized delamination processes caused by partial melting . as an alternative heat transfer model , heat pipe mode is suggested in io and the earth ( moore 2001 ; moore & webb 2013 ) , which can be the important heat transfer mechanism for the tidally heated extrasolar planets .",
    "thus , the effects of delamination and heat pipe should be considered in future work .",
    "it was revealed that mars had an intrinsic magnetic field in the past ( acua et al .",
    "the most probable origin of the intrinsic magnetic field is the dynamo in the core .",
    "the mechanism of the martian dynamo is not well understood .",
    "however , it is required that more heat than that transported by adiabatic heat flux is transported from the core to the mantle in order to induce the core convection ( nimmo & stevenson 2000 ) .",
    "if tidal heat is not generated in the mantle , heat is transported sufficiently by the mantle and a dynamo may be induced .",
    "however , in our calculations , tidal heating heats up the mantle . in some cases",
    ", heat is even transported from the mantle to the core .",
    "thus , in the hot state of a planet , it is unlikely the dynamo is activated .",
    "an intrinsic magnetic field is not predicted in a tidally heated planet ; however , if the orbital plane of the planet is oblique to the magnetic axis of the star , an induced magnetic field may be possible because of the melt in the mantle .",
    "in the case of io , an induced magnetic field is observed ( khurana et al .",
    "the induced magnetic field of io is consistent with a mantle of at least 20 % partial melt ( khurana et al . 2011 ) .",
    "this melt fraction is comparable to our calculation results .      for simplicity , we assume that the internal structure of the planet is spherical shells and depends only on the radial distance . as for the habitable zone",
    ", the spherical - shell structure should provide a valid approximation because the temperature in light side is not so high .",
    "however , the heterogeneity of the planet is an interesting topic for future study , especially for planets that orbit significantly close to their stars .",
    "tidal heating in a planet with a heterogeneous structure was calculated for the case of enceladus , though it is extremely complicated ( tobie et al .",
    "2008 ; bhounkov et al .",
    "if coupled calculations including a heterogeneous structure are possible in future work , an important comparison to the spherical - shell model of this work can be made .",
    "one caveat is that the coupled calculations in this work do not consider the resonance of the planet .",
    "if the planet is in a resonant state with other planets , the orbital evolution becomes significantly more complicated .",
    "resonance among planets increases the planets eccentricity , as exhibited by the jovian satellites io , europa and ganymede ( murray & dermott 1999 ) .",
    "some satellites around saturn also interact with each other ( murray & dermott 1999 ) .",
    "hence , if there are multiple planets around a star , we must consider the resonance between them .",
    "through thermal and orbital coupled calculations , it was found that two types of evolution are probable for martian - sized planets in the habitable zones of m stars .",
    "one type is the runaway cooling state in which the radiated heat flux is larger than the tidal heating , decreasing the mantle temperature through positive feedback . as a result of the cooling , convection in the mantle",
    "is reduced and the planet becomes rigid .",
    "the other type of evolution is the hot state . in a hot state",
    ", tidal heating exceeds the radiated heat flux and runaway heating occurs .",
    "however , melt in the mantle reduces the tidal heating by decreasing the viscosity and shear modulus , and an equilibrium state is reached .",
    "the eccentricity and orbital distance of hot state planets do not change significantly due to the large q value caused by the melt .",
    "thus , the planet in hot state can stay the habitable zone for more than a few billion years . in the equilibrium state ,",
    "the heat flux is in the range suitable for habitability ( barnes et al .",
