    "diffractive production of vector mesons has been a major subject at hera , and the large body of data obtained serves to elucidate the physics of the qcd ",
    "pomeron and/or the small@xmath1 gluon density in the proton @xcite . for a review at this workshop ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "while data  taking at hera has come to an end , hadron colliders , such as tevatron and lhc provide opportunities to study photoproduction processes at still higher energies than those covered by hera .",
    "the exciting experimental possibilities at tevatron at lhc have been presented at this workshop in the plenary talk @xcite .",
    "besides the photoproduction mechanism of exclusive @xmath0production in hadronic collisions , there could also exist a purely hadronic mechanism , where the @xmath0 production proceeds through the pomeron ",
    "odderon fusion . from this point of view a detailed study of the photoproduction mechanism , if possible including the effects of absorptive corrections",
    "is much desired .",
    "the results presented here are based on ref .",
    "@xcite and ongoing work with a. rybarska . for an analogous study of @xmath2 production ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "6.4 cm    6.4 cm    6.4 cm    6.4 cm    the mechanism for exclusive @xmath0 production is depicted in fig.([f1 ] ) .",
    "the exchanged photons have small virtualities , certainly @xmath3 , and what enters the calculation is the photoproduction amplitude @xmath4 . under mild assumptions",
    ", this subprocess amplitude can be directly obtained from the hera data on @xmath5distributions of @xmath0 s , @xmath6 in particular , we assumed that @xmath7channel helicity conserving pieces dominate , which is indeed borne out by experiment , see the detailed review @xcite for references .",
    "the second ingredient is the amplitude for elastic scattering of the incoming ( anti)protons , which enters in the evaluation of absorptive / rescattering corrections .",
    "we also essentially take it from data .",
    "our resulting predictions are then only mildly model  dependent .",
    "some reservations exist regarding the possible presence of inelastic intermediate states in the rescattering diagram , which can however be estimated by simple enhancement factors . from the large amount of detailed plots shown in our presentation we select a few representative ones : in fig([f2 ] ) , we show a scan of the fully differential cross section @xmath8 , at tevatron energies . here",
    "@xmath9 is the rapidity of the @xmath0 , @xmath10 are the transverse momenta of the outgoing ( anti)protons , and @xmath11 is the azimuthal angle between them .",
    "the dependence on @xmath11 is caused by the interference of the two diagrams of fig([f1 ] ) , which enters with a different sign in @xmath12 and @xmath13 collisions .",
    "the steep peak at small @xmath14 is naturally due to the photon pole .",
    "the rich dip  bump structure is fairly sensitive to the precise treatment of absorptive corrections , for more details , see @xcite .",
    "the plots of figs([f3 ] , [ f4 ] ) are results not contained in @xcite . here , for the @xmath15 subprocess we did not use a purely phenomenological parametrisation , but used a pqcd  based @xmath16factorisation approach @xcite to calculate the relevant amplitude in terms of an unintegrated gluon density of the proton and the light  cone wave function of the final state vector meson .",
    "this machinery allows us to calculate also production of excited vector mesons , for which hera data are rather sparse and insufficient for predictions directly from data . in fig([f3 ] ) we show the rapidity spectra @xmath17 at tevatron energies . in the left panel",
    "we show results for the @xmath18 , in the right panel we display the cross section for production of the radial excitation @xmath19 . here , the light cone wave functions of @xmath20 which we used are purely phenomenological anstze , constrained by the decay width to leptons , as well as the orthogonality condition @xcite .",
    "we checked , that our form of the wavefunction leads to a good description of the @xmath21ratio measured in photoproduction at hera .",
    "the size of the @xmath22 production cross section roughly corresponds to the @xmath23ratio in photoproduction . in fig([f4 ] ) we show predictions for lhc  energies .",
    "an accurate treatment of absorption at lhc energies must go beyond the elastic rescattering included so far , still our estimates of fig([f4 ] ) could be of some use .",
    "the rise of the @xmath9distribution from central rapidities to the peak reflects the pomeron intercept in the @xmath15 production amplitude , and could be further affected by absorptive corrections to that subprocess .",
    "already the included absorptive corrections affect the shape of the rapidity distribution , because larger @xmath9 also involves larger photon virtualities , and hence shorter distances , where absorption is stronger .",
    "while analysis is in progress at the tevatron @xcite , measurements of exclusive @xmath0 at lhc will be very challenging , prospects are better for @xmath2 s discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank jim pinfold for discussions during meson2008 .",
