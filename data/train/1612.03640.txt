    "the performance of a a brain - computer interface ( bci ) is related both to the performance of the signal processing techniques that are used for assigning some electroencephalogram ( eeg ) signal to a command and to the possibility of the user to adapt him / herself to the system over time .",
    "indeed , advanced machine learning , signal processing and classifier techniques have been widely used for improving bcis , _ e.g. _  @xcite . in spite of these recent improvements in the bci community ,",
    "several obstacles remain to fully transfer laboratory - demonstrated bcis to real commercial / clinical applications .",
    "alternative systems like eyetrackers or bci based on steady - state visual evoked potentials could be effective solutions for spelling applications .",
    "these systems are even more relevant as the efficiency of the p300 speller depends on eye gaze  @xcite . in regard to these recent studies",
    ", the bci should be chosen in relation to the gaze control capability of the patient .",
    "however , the best judge shall remain the user / patient with the bci part integrated in a complete functional system .",
    "therefore , the improvement of the p300 speller shall still be an active research topic .",
    "we consider in this work the bci p300-speller .",
    "this paradigm allows people to select symbols where each symbol is depicted in a cell of a matrix on a computer screen .",
    "it is based on the oddball paradigm to generate event - related potentials ( erps ) , like the p300 , on targets selected by the user .",
    "the classical p300-speller consists of a @xmath0 matrix , which the different items that can be selected by the user  @xcite . during the experiments , the user has to focus on the character she / he wants to spell .",
    "when the user focuses on a cell of the matrix , _",
    "i.e. _  the item the person wants to select , it is possible to detect a p300 , which corresponds to a positive deflection in voltage at a latency of about 300 ms relative to the stimuli onset in the eeg signal .",
    "this deflection is time - locked to the onset of the cell intensification .",
    "the rows and columns are intensified randomly to generate erps . in the original implementation of the speller , row / column intensifications are block randomized in 12 events ( 6 rows and 6 columns ) . this set of 12 intensifications is repeated @xmath1 times for each character .",
    "hence , @xmath2 possible p300 responses should be detected for the recognition of one character .",
    "the main challenge for the p300 paradigm is to provide a reliable and fast performance in a domestic or clinical environment , _",
    "i.e. _  outside of the laboratory . to achieve such goals , the sensors can be ideally chosen to reduce the preparation time , the cost of an amplifier and the eeg cap  @xcite .",
    "most of the available systems lacks robustness over time and across subjects : the performance does not meet user s requirements due to unadapted end - user interface .",
    "however , there exist few exceptions as in  @xcite , where a late stage als ( amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ) patient could use a p300-speller at home developed by the wolpaw lab .",
    "the intendix solution has been proposed by g.tec in 2009 .",
    "this bci is designed to be installed and operated by caregivers or the patient s family at home . according to the g.tec company ,",
    "the performance for the majority of healthy users during their first trial is estimated to a spelling rate of 5 to 10 characters per minute ( cpm ) .",
    "this bci is proposed as a whole package ( software , amplifier , caps , ... ) , which provides a global solution  @xcite .",
    "most of the improvements in the p300-speller have been achieved at the signal processing like spatial filtering  @xcite and/or detection level with techniques like support vector machines  @xcite , neural networks  @xcite or bayesian linear discriminant analysis  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the p300-speller graphical user interface ( gui ) , in its matrix form , has not evolved much for more than two decades in spite of some studies , _ e.g. _",
    "some improvements have been proposed as in  @xcite , where the color of the flickering matrices should be green / blue . to extend the user - centered approach known for signal detection",
    ", many problems should be addressed for the design of gui .",
    "indeed , a poorly designed gui can be an obstacle for an ideal detection of the p300 .    in the present study",
    ", we show some efficient and easy solutions for solving problems demonstrated in the literature about the p300 speller paradigm .",
    "in addition , we propose the addition of a visual feedback for each visual stimulus on the possible targets .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the main novelties of the p300 speller , the gui and the signal processing methods , are presented in the second and third section , respectively .",
    "the experimental protocol is given in the fourth section .",
    "results are detailed and then discussed in the last sections .",
    "two paradigms were evaluated : the classical p300 speller ( cp300 ) and the proposed p300 speller paradigm ( xp300 ) , which is depicted in fig .  [",
    "fig : gui ] .",
    "these two paradigms differ only in the following three parameters : the place of the flashes ( section  [ sec : vs1 ] ) , the order of the flashes ( section  [ sec : vs2 ] ) , and the visual feedback for counting flashes ( section  [ sec : vs3 ] ) .      in the p300 paradigm , only flashes of groups containing the attended item should elicit a p300 . in the original implementation of the p300-bci , and in its most recent implementations , flashed items are grouped as rows and columns ( rc ) . one major problem with the rc paradigm is the classical presentations of the different flashes as they involve frequent error around the target .",
    "furthermore , the p300-bci gui has not really evolved for 22 years  @xcite .",
    "although the size , the color and other parameters of the interface have been investigated , the rc paradigm is still one major invariant in the literature .",
    "an alternative to the rc paradigm , the checkerboard paradigm ( cb ) , has been proposed  @xcite . it is a combination of two checkerboards to avoid the well known confusion problems in the neighborhood of the target  @xcite . both the online accuracy and the information transfer rate ( itr ) were also significantly higher for the cb than for the rc .",
    "they have proved that the rc paradigm has a direct impact on the performance .",
    "thus , improving the flashing paradigm will improve the performance .",
    "however , in  @xcite , a comparison across nine healthy subjects of four stimulus presentation modes revealed that only complex highlighting effects composed of brightness enhancement , rotation , enlargement and a trichromatic grid overlay in combination with row - column spatial arrangements of simultaneously highlighted objects improved single sub - trial classification performance .",
    "the rc paradigm is shown to be just a special case of a more generic model . in this model ,",
    "we propose alternatives to the rc paradigm , which offer relevant properties for p300-bcis .",
    "we denote by @xmath3 the size of the matrix @xmath4 that contains the different symbols .",
    "@xmath5 represents the symbol at the @xmath6 row and the @xmath7 column . in the rc paradigm ,",
    "a target can be identified as the intersection of a row and a column after @xmath8 flashes , where @xmath9",
    "flashes occur on the matrix rows , and the other @xmath9 flashes are on the matrix columns .",
    "let @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the two @xmath12 matrices containing the items to be intensified at the same time .",
    "for instance with @xmath13 , + we denote by @xmath10 and @xmath11 , the matrices of size @xmath3 that contain the indices of the different possible flashes .",
    "for instance , @xmath14 , if @xmath15 and the flash number @xmath16 must be flashed , then each cell @xmath17 will be intensified .",
    "for @xmath13 , we obtain :    c@c@ @xmath10 =    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in addition to the raw performance of the speller , an important question is to know which paradigm the users would choose .",
    "according to the questionnaire results and the subjects comments , xp300 was preferred by every subject . in the comments ,",
    "the type of fatigue differs in relation to the paradigm . with cp300 ,",
    "it is harder to pay attention to the flashes .",
    "thus , subjects feel the need to be more focused with cp300 . with xp300 ,",
    "every subject feels more comfortable during the experiment .",
    "however , some subjects acknowledge that the feedback for counting flashes could be an inconvenient : when the user feels comfortable with the interface , their mind may wander . in spite of these remarks",
    ", xp300 was chosen by every subject as the best choice for potential long sessions .",
    "each flash has a meaning and it is possible to shift directly to the next character once a character is spelt .",
    "while the speller accuracy is only better with xp300 with a low number of repetitions due to the efficiency of the p300 detection , the subjective evaluation of xp300 clearly shows the user preference of xp300 .",
    "the proposed method is a good alternative to the classical p300 paradigm .",
    "indeed , it increases the oddball paradigm aspect by considering pseudo - random subsets of symbols for each flash instead of rows and columns .",
    "the odd aspect of the oddball paradigm has been limited to the order of the flash ( odd in time ) , but here it is formally spatially odd , without increasing the number of visual stimuli . as the visual stimuli with xp300 are presented in an odder way than with cp300 , it is possible to separate the blocks of flashes and reduce the probability of consecutive flashes on the target .",
    "in addition , the feedback for counting the visual stimuli is a great help for subjects by increasing the meaning of the visual stimuli .",
    "these encouraging results would probably benefit the current target of p300-bci users , _",
    "e.g. _  locked - in patients .",
    "many graphical improvements could benefit the original p300 speller paradigm .",
    "these improvements should be oriented toward increasing the interface usability .",
    "like for signal processing methods , some parameters can be set for all subjects , _",
    "e.g. _  bandpass filtering , and others shall be tuned in relation to the user , _",
    "e.g. _  spatial filters .",
    "the proposed paradigm proposed solutions to hypotheses that were already validated in the literature : the confusions around the target due to the rc paradigm , the attentional blink when the target to target interval is too short , and the importance of the stimuli meaning .",
    "although the proposed solution provided better results across subjects , some parameters may be set in relation to a particular individual .",
    "the characteristics of the paradigm are sources for better understanding the underlying neural processes in the p300 speller . however , the observations of the erps suggest a major role for the visual evoked potentials . the modifications of the visual stimulus shall be defined as parameters that affect the p300 amplitude : subjective probability , stimulus meaning , and information transmission  @xcite .",
    "the visual stimulus in the p300 paradigm has no meaning for a person who wants to spell a character .",
    "this is due to the number of repetitions that are done for the selection of a character .",
    "indeed , a single visual stimulus does not imply the selection of a character .",
    "the relevance of the stimulus to the task should be increased .",
    "the p300 amplitude is lower when some stimulus information is lost , like when the stimulus is harder to discriminate or perceive .",
    "p3b requires attention , and increasing the difficulty of maintaining attention will correspondingly decrease p3b amplitude .",
    "the relevance of the stimulus to the task , and the amount of information a stimulus transmits are all variables that will determine p3b amplitude  @xcite . in xp300 ,",
    "the stimulus is fully integrated as a part of the character selection : the little dots around the character shall be filled for its selection .",
    "the little dots work here as a feedback for the main stimulus ( the change of color and size of the matrix cell ) .",
    "this could suggest that each individual stimulus should have a meaning and should be translated into action . as not only perceptual processes are involved , the user should be able to assign a meaning to the visual stimuli , which are related to the application .",
    "other feedbacks , like neurofeedback in relation to single trial detection , could probably enhance the meaning of each visual stimulus .    finally ,",
    "although the p300 speller can still be improved through methods that increase the reliability over time and across subjects , and the itr , future works will directly be addressed at the application level _ e.g. _  by considering word completion , prediction , and knowledge of the vocabulary ."
