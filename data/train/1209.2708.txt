    "determining the dark matter content of the milky way has important implications for fields ranging from theories of galaxy formation and evolution to experimental physics . lately , there has been renewed interest in an old concept  applying jeans equations to stars in the milky way to infer the underlying mass distribution @xcite .",
    "this technique statistically estimates the gravitational potential using observable stellar kinematics , rather than accelerations that are rarely detectable .",

    ". using cylindrical coordinates and assuming an axi - symmetric and steady - state system , the accelerations in the radial ( @xmath4 ) and vertical ( @xmath5 ) directions can be expressed in terms of observable quantities : the stellar number density distribution , @xmath6 , the mean azimuthal ( rotational ) velocity @xmath7 , and four velocity dispersions , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 ( all as functions of @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) , as @xmath12 @xmath13 given accelerations @xmath14 and @xmath15 , _",

    "the main conclusion drawn from such local studies is that dark matter contributes a small ( of the order 10% ) but significantly detected fraction of mass in the solar neighborhood ( corresponding to about 0.01 @xmath16 pc@xmath17 , or 0.38 gev cm@xmath17 ; * ? ? ?",

    "several groups have extended these studies to a few kiloparsec from the plane of the disk @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite used a sample of 2000 k dwarf stars that extend to 1 kpc above the plane of the disk and estimated the local dark matter density distribution @xmath19 . using kinematic data for @xmath0400 thick disk stars at distances of a few kpc from the galactic plane from @xcite , @xcite estimated @xmath20 .",
    "it has been difficult to extend these measurements to distances beyond a few kiloparsec from the solar neighborhood @xcite .",
    "recently , using a sample of @xmath02,500 blue horizontal branch stars from sdss dr6 , @xcite found an estimate of the milky way s circular velocity curve at @xmath060 kpc that implied the existance of dark matter . using a spherical approximation of jeans equations and extending the analysis of the @xcite sample",
    ", @xcite also concluded that the newtonian model without dark matter can not fit the observed velocity dispersion profile .",
    "they also tested various mond models and concluded that these fit the data as well .    here",
    "we extend these studies and introduce a novel multi - dimensional application of jeans equations made possible by the sloan digital sky survey data ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter sdss ) . due to substantial sdss sky coverage and accurate multi - color photometry to faint limits ,",
    "the stellar number density distribution and stellar kinematics were mapped out using numerous main sequence stars detected to galactocentric distances of @xmath020 kpc @xcite .",
    "the extent of these maps is sufficiently large that it is possible to investigate stellar acceleration via jeans equations .",
    "most importantly , while the spatial derivatives of the velocity dispersion are extremely difficult to constrain from the local solar neighborhood , they can be directly measured using sdss data .",
    "we discuss here the following main questions :    * how does the inclusion or exclusion of a dark matter component affect the morphology of the stellar acceleration maps ?",
    "* is it possible to recover the known accelerations by applying jeans equations to a realistic simulated galaxy that has a merger history and is not perfectly axi - symmetric ? * are stellar acceleration maps derived from sdss data consistent with expectations based only on visible matter ?",
    "this paper provides a brief summary of our analysis ; a detailed discussion will be presented elsewhere ( loebman et al .  , in prep ) . in  [ s : background ] , we describe the simulation employed in this work and answer the first two questions .",

    "we summarize and discuss our results in  [ s : conclusion ] .",
    "-.15 in    to test the jeans equation approach , we apply our analysis tools to a simulation with _ known _ accelerations and velocities .",

    "dark matter consists of 36% of the total mass in the region corresponding to the solar neighborhood ( @xmath32 & @xmath33 ) .",
    "the simulated galaxy is approximately rotationally symmetric ( a total matter axis ratio @xmath34 within 100 kpc , and a stellar matter axis ratio @xmath35 at @xmath4=10 kpc ) , has a @xmath4-band disk scale length of @xmath03.1 kpc ( versus the milky way s @xmath36 kpc , see * ? ? ?",

    "will be presented in a subsequent paper .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ f : ratio ] shows @xmath38 within the simulation . for comparison",
    ", the middle panel shows an analogous map when only contributions from star and gas particles are included . as is evident",
    ", there are substantial differences in the morphology of the two maps ; the bottom panel demonstrates that the effect of dark matter on the resulting acceleration increases quickly towards the outer parts of the galaxy ; for example , the ratio of accelerations is doubled by @xmath4=8 kpc and @xmath5=6 kpc .",
    "these distances are probed by sdss  hence our results suggest that the effect of dark matter on stellar acceleration may be uncovered in sdss data .      here",
    "we verify that the known gravitational accelerations in the simulation can be recovered using jeans equations .",
    "we bin the star particles into 1 kpc by 1 kpc rectilinear pixels in @xmath40 space and limit our analysis to bins containing at least 100 star particles . using weights proportional to the mass of each star particle",
    ", we create maps of @xmath41 and kinematic quantities .",
    "the spatial derivatives of these quantities at the position of each pixel are computed by first fitting a second order polynomial in @xmath4 and @xmath5 using the eight neighboring pixels , and then taking derivatives analytically ; edge pixels are discarded to minimize the impact of fitting errors .",
    "we compare the acceleration in the @xmath5 direction computed using eqs .",
    "[ eq1 ] and [ eq2 ] to the true acceleration in figure  [ f : jeans_works ] .",
    "the recovered acceleration map is close to the true map : the distribution of pixel values from the bottom panel is centered on 1.05 with a root - mean - square scatter ( rms ) of 0.24 .",
    "similar agreement is obtained for the acceleration in @xmath4 direction , which is centered on 1.02 with a rms value of 0.38 .",
    "we note that jeans equations recover meaningful acceleration maps even though the simulation is neither perfectly rotationally symmetric nor steady state . given this precedence",
    ", we apply the same technique to synthetic sdss data .",
    "a direct application of jeans equations to sdss data would be complicated because of the complex selection effects and the impact of substructure . instead",
    ", we employ a catalog generated using the code galfast , which is designed to quantitatively reproduce the sdss measurements , volume coverage , selection and other instrumental effects .",
    "it incorporates smooth models for the stellar number density distribution , metallicity distribution and kinematics based on tomographic analysis of sdss data @xcite .",
    "the most important ingredients for this study are the best - fit power - law halo given by eq .  24 in @xcite , with power - law index @xmath42 , axis ratio @xmath43 , and halo velocity ellipsoid that is invariant in spherical coordinates @xcite , with @xmath44 km / s , @xmath45 km / s , and @xmath46 km / s .",
    "while the same analytic models could be used to directly generate acceleration maps , we use mock catalogs instead to account for shot noise due to a finite number of stars and edge effects and to ensure that the same analysis code verified on the simulation is used when processing real data .",
    "we emphasize that the cylindrical symmetry built into galfast is fully consistent with sdss data ( after local substructure is masked , see * ? ? ?",
    "using galfast , we generate a flux - limited catalog with @xmath47 and mimic the sdss sky footprint by only considering high galactic latitudes ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "a halo - like sample of 0.61 million stars is selected using @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this sample is dominated by low - metallicity main sequence f stars .",
    "the catalog lists true positions , absolute magnitudes , velocities and metallicity , as well as corresponding simulated sdss observations convolved with measurement errors .",
    "figure  [ f : moments ] shows the three observables constructed using the galfast catalog that are required to compute @xmath51 using eq .",
    "as expected , both velocity dispersions are smoothly varying , and the @xmath52 is at most 40% of the maximal @xmath53 value .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ f : galfast ] shows the resulting @xmath51 map .",
    "the middle and bottom panels show the ratio of this map compared to the simulation data in the two maps shown in the top and middle panels in figure  [ f : ratio ] .",
    "it is evident that the acceleration map implied by sdss data is much closer to the model - based acceleration map that includes contributions from both baryons and dark matter .",
    "when dark matter is not included , the model - based map has a different shape than the map derived from sdss data : it under - predicts the observed acceleration by roughly a factor of three at @xmath54 kpc and @xmath55 kpc .",
    "a pixel - by - pixel comparison of the two ratio maps is shown in the the top panel in figure  [ f : hist ] ; the fact that the _ shape _ of the observed acceleration map is better matched when dark matter is included is seen as a much narrower histogram .",
    "these results are not unique to @xmath51 ; the bottom panel in figure  [ f : hist ] shows the same result for @xmath56 , with even larger deviations between the observed map and the model - based map that does not include dark matter contribution .    our preliminary analysis of other simulations",
    "indicate that the observed acceleration map can not be reproduced by simply increasing the amount of baryons and not including dark matter : the key difficulty is to reproduce the strong acceleration at @xmath57@xmath58 kpc from the galactic center while simultaneously maintaining the shape of the acceleration map throughout the probed volume .",
    "we have shown that the kinematics of stars can be used to probe the dark matter distribution in the milky way .",
    "to do so , we used a cosmologically derived @xmath1body@xmath2sph milky way  like simulation to demonstrate that jeans equations are capable of recovering the underlying gravitational potential despite small deviations from an implied steady - state axi - symmetric system .",
    "the same simulation was also used to estimate the dark matter contribution to the resulting acceleration maps .",
    "we also generated a synthetic sdss catalog using galfast , a code designed to quantitatively reproduce measurements of spatial density and kinematics of milky way stars , as well as sdss volume coverage , selection and other instrumental effects . with this catalog",
    ", we created acceleration maps using jeans equations .",
    "the morphology of these maps provides strong evidence for the presence of dark matter .",
    "this evidence is not sensitive to the overall dark matter to baryon mass ratio ( that is , the _ normalization _ of the acceleration maps ) , which can be considered as a fine - tuning model parameter , but is robustly derived from the _ shape _ of observed acceleration maps .    while the method presented here does not yet provide errors for the total estimate of dark matter in the milky way , it does provide an expanded view of the distribution of dark matter beyond the solar neighborhood .",
    "significantly , it allows us to consider how the distribution of dark matter evolves both radially and vertically in the context of a large , observationally motivated dataset . given a large number of simulations with different dark matter halo properties",
    ", it will be possible to constrain the overall dark matter to baryonic mass ratio and the shape of the milky way s dark matter halo .",
    "before such a suite of simulations is generated , we can approximately estimate the shape of the dark matter halo using the method proposed by @xcite .",
    "he showed that for an oblate dark matter halo with a density distribution similar to a singular isothermal sphere , it is possible to derive the dark matter axis ratio from the stellar halo axis ratio and the velocity ellipsoid ( via application of jeans equations ; see his eqs . 1 and 21 and figure 1 ) .",
    "using sdss measurements for the stellar halo axis ratio and the velocity ellipsoid ( see  [ s : results ] ) , we estimated that the minor to major axis ratio of the milky way s dark matter halo is @xmath59 .",
    "compared to the stellar halo axis ratio , @xmath43 , the dark matter halo is more oblate .",
    "the @xmath1-body@xmath2sph simulation used in this work supports the properties of the dark matter halo assumed in the van der marel s method ; in particular , its density decrease is consistent with expected @xmath60 $ ] within 30 kpc from the origin ( with the power - law index decreasing from @xmath61 to about @xmath62 at larger distances ) . at the same time , the stellar halo is consistent with @xmath63 measured by sdss in the same distance range . while it is premature to declare @xmath64 as a robust measurement of the dark matter halo shape , it is encouraging that the simulation is at least qualitatively consistent with sdss data in so many aspects .",
    "moreover , it is possible to go beyond jeans equations to use stellar kinematics to probe the full phase space distribution of stars .",
    "as @xcite demonstrated , orbital spectral analysis can be used to determine not only the shape of the inner halo , but the global shape of the galactic halo as well .",
    "their technique provides a complementary tool to the method presented here for constraining the potential and the stellar distribution function .",
    "we note , there is a considerable range of milky way dark matter halo axis ratios presented in the literature .",
    "the reported axis ratio ranges from @xmath650.7 at the low end @xcite to @xmath66/@xmath67 at the high end @xcite . sometimes , triaxial models are incorporated , such as by @xcite who used observations of sgr tidal stream and n - body modeling to conclude that the milky way has a triaxial dark matter halo that is nearly an oblate ellipsoid whose minor axis is contained within the galactic disk plane .",
    "@xcite used satellite galaxies to find the milky way dark matter halo is oblate , while @xcite used observations of hi and claimed variation of the axis ratio , with the halo increasingly prolate at large distances",
    ".    the full promise of various methods for estimating the geometry of dark matter halos will be reached by upcoming next - generation surveys , such as gaia @xcite and lsst @xcite .",
    "gaia will provide measurements of geometric distances and kinematics with a similar faint flux limit as sdss , but with much smaller errors .",
    "lsst will obtain photometric distances and kinematics of comparable accuracy to those of gaia at gaia s faint limit , but extend them deeper by about 5  mag .",
    "with lsst and gaia , it will be possible to extend galactic potential studies such as the one presented here to distances roughly 10 times larger than those possible with sdss data , revolutionizing our understanding of the milky way in the process .",
