    "convex hulls of function classes have become of great interest in machine learning since the introduction of adaboost and other methods of combining classifiers . the most commonly used measure of complexity of convex hulls",
    "is based on covering numbers ( or metric entropies ) .",
    "the first bound on the entropy of the convex hull of a set in a hilbert space was obtained by dudley @xcite and later refined by ball and pajor @xcite and a different proof was given independently by van der vaart and wellner @xcite .",
    "these authors considered the case of polynomial growth of the covering numbers of the base class .",
    "sharp bounds in the case of exponential growth of the covering numbers of the base class as well as extension of previously konwn results to the case of banach spaces were obtained later @xcite .    in machine learning ,",
    "however , the quantities of primary importance for determining the generalization performance are not the entropies themselves but rather localized gaussian or rademacher complexities of the function classes @xcite .",
    "these quantities are closely related to continuity moduli of the corresponding stochastic processes .",
    "our main purpose in this paper is to provide an easy bound on the continuity modulus of stochastic processes like rademacher or gaussian processes on the convex hull of a class in terms of the continuity modulus on the class itself .",
    "we combine this result with some new bounds on the generalization error in function learning problems based on localized rademacher complexities .",
    "this allows us to bound the generalization error for convex hulls in terms of characteristics of the base class .",
    "in addition to this , we use the bounds on continuity moduli on convex hulls to give very simple proofs of some previously known results on the entropy of such classes .",
