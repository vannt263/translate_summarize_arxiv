    "surface electrons ( se ) levitating over liquid helium has been used as a paradigmatic quasi - two dimensional electron system ( q2des ) .",
    "it constitutes the counterpart of the electron system on semiconductor heterostructures in the sense that the electrons on helium obey the classical statistics because the low densities achievable in experiments ( @xmath0 @xmath1 ) .",
    "one point difference between them comes from the scattering mechanisms . in the former system",
    ", electrons are scattered by surface excitations , the ripplons , and by vapor atoms of the helium surface . in the latter one , scattering by impurities , phonons , and interface roughness are the processes that limit the electron mobility . besides the remarkable phenomena discovered in this low - dimensional electron system , for instance , wigner crystallization@xcite and the existence of edgemagnetoplasmons@xcite se have been used as a probe to investigate the elementary surface excitations of cryogenic liquids and solids .",
    "very recently there is an intensive search for experimental realization of se as qubits leading to a quantum computer.@xcite for a overview of the field see ref . .",
    "for electrons trapped on the bulk helium surface it is well known that the se mobility is dominated by the electron - helium gas atom scattering for @xmath2 k whereas the se scattering by quantized capillary waves ( ripplons ) is responsible for mobility at lower temperatures where the helium vapor density becomes negligible .",
    "the experimental data for se mobility over bulk helium are in reasonable agreement with theoretical calculations.@xcite    the situation changes when se are floating over a helium film which in turn is deposited over a solid substrate . in such a condition it is possible to increase significantly the accessible range of electron densitiesmistgunz97 and the electron correlations may become important . furthermore , the electron energy spectrum , the ripplon dispersion relation and the electron - ripplon interaction are modified significantly due to film effects and the van der waals forces from the substrate now play a decisive role in the transport properties . furthermore , besides the usual scattering mechanisms pointed out above , we must consider the se scattering by interface defects at the helium film - substrate boundary , which , as it have been shown in experiments is responsible by the unusual behavior of the se transport properties on a helium film.platzman86,jiangdahm87,jiangstandahm88,hucarmidahm92,dahm97    the present work intends to provide a detailed theoretical study of the mobility of se localized over a helium film deposited on substrates , as solid neon , glass and poly(methyl - methacrylate ) [ pmma ] , which are the materials that have been used in the experiments .",
    "we employ the boltzmann transport equation approach ( bea ) and the force balance equation method ( fbem ) in which coulomb effects on the mobility are taken into account through the dynamical structural factor of the q2des .",
    "we calculate the se mobility as a function of temperature and the film thickness in the range @xmath3",
    "@xmath4 @xmath5  . from the comparison with experimental results we check the role of all scattering processes involved and",
    "verify the reliability of the interface roughness model used in our treatment .",
    "we find that the se mobility is strongly determined by the interface roughness substrate and the results are in quite good agreement with the experiments .",
    "electron states on a liquid helium film are confined in the direction normal to the surface ( @xmath6 ) due to the potential well created by a infinitely high barrier which prevents the electrons penetrate inside the liquid phase and by and attractive potential due to the electron interaction with the polarizable substrates and an applied holding electric field @xmath7 along the @xmath6 direction .",

    "one has found that the energy gap between the ground and first excited subbands increases considerably by decreasing @xmath26 .",
    "for example @xmath27 k for @xmath28 cm for the neon substrate and is much larger for a substrate with higher @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite then one can disregard the possibility of electron transition to excited subbands which is proportional to @xmath29 $ ] and take only the ground subband into account in the calculation of the scattering matrix elements .",

    "we point out that the numerical results within the fbem are the same as those obtained in the complete control approximation ( cca).@xcite in the cca , the mobility is calculated with the bea , but in the regime where the electron - electron collision frequency is much higher than the collision frequency due to other mechanisms .",
    "the electrons are supposed to redistribute their momenta , due to collisions between electrons , in such a way that the momentum of the total system does not change but electrons acquire the same drift velocity .",
    "the coincidence of results indicates that in order to establish the specific role of electron - electron interactions we must go beyond the noninteracting dynamical structure factor for calculating the mobility in the fbem as given by eq .",
    "( [ 32 ] ) .",
    "our conclusions then are valid only in the low or intermediate electron density regime .",
    "in this work we have studied the dependence of the mobility of surface electrons over a liquid helium film on the temperature and on the film thickness .",

    "the parameters are adjustable through the evaluation of both temperature and film thickness dependencies of the mobility .",
    "the values obtained for the strength and range of the rough interface are of the order of few atomic layers and @xmath3   respectively which are reliable and in the mesoscopic regime .",
    "we showed that the se mobility is limited by the roughness scattering because electron - ripplon and electron - gas atom scattering can not explain the experimental data .",
