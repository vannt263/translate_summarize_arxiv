    "today , the broad field of nanostructure is at the heart of many technological devices  @xcite .",
    "naturally , at this scale and for low temperature , quantum mechanics plays a fundamental role   @xcite .",
    "recently , much effort has been devoted to study nanostructures , using as model that of quantum circuits with charge discreteness @xcite .",
    "work has been published on subjects such as persistent currents   @xcite , coupled quantum circuits @xcite , the electronic resonator  @xcite , quantum point contacts  @xcite , and others @xcite . in this article , we are interested in spatially extended quantum circuits ( transmission lines ) with charge discreteness .",
    "this is an interesting specific theoretical subject of broad potential applications , since nano - devices could be put together forming chains , and then be viewed as electric transmission lines .",
    "for instance , electric transport properties in dna have been measured recently  @xcite ; some degree of disagreement related to conducting properties exists , nevertheless , it is clear that the dna molecule could be viewed and modeled as a quantum transmission line .",
    "moreover , molecular electronic circuits  @xcite are actively studied theoretically and experimentally . in such systems ,",
    "chains of individual molecules form a line of circuits . therefore , quantum circuits is a broad field involving future applications from the perspective of nano - devices , electric transmission in macromolecules , left - handed materials , toda lattice , and others .    in this work",
    "we will consider a wavefront solution for an extended quantum circuit ( transmission line ) .",
    "for the first time , a sequence of bands and gaps is found and characterized for this specific system with charge discreteness , giving hopes for the description of more complex extended systems ( dual transmission lines , complex basis , etc . ) .    in section  [ sectrans ]",
    "we will introduce the hamiltonian for coupled circuits , and the equations of motion for the spatially continuous systems . in sec .",
    "[ wavefront ] , the wavefront solution is obtained and the band - gap structure is characterized , in sec .  [ stability ] the stability question is considered . in sec .",
    "[ dual ] the dual line hamiltonian is introduced . in sec .",
    "[ toda ] the connection with toda lattice is presented .",
    "finally , we state our conclusions .",
    "it is known that for a chain of quantum capacitively - coupled quantum circuits with charge discreteness ( @xmath1 ) , the hamiltonian may be written as  @xcite :    @xmath2    where the index @xmath3 describes the cell ( circuit ) at position @xmath3 , containing an inductance @xmath4 and capacitance @xmath5 .",
    "the conjugate operators , charge @xmath6 and pseudoflux @xmath7 satisfy the usual commutation rule @xmath8=i\\hbar \\delta _ { l , l^{\\prime } } $ ] . a spatially extended solution of eq . ( [ eqhamilton ] ) will be called a _ cirquiton like solution _ , corresponding to the quantization of the classical electric transmission line with discrete charge ( i.e. elementary charge @xmath1 ) .",
    "note that in the formal limit @xmath9 the above hamiltonian gives the well - known dynamics related to the one - band quantum transmission line , similar to the phonon case .",
    "the system described by eq .",
    "( [ eqhamilton ] ) is very cumbersome since the equations of motion for the operators are highly nonlinear due to charge discreteness .",
    "however , this system is invariant under the transformation @xmath10 , that is , the total pseudoflux operator @xmath11 commutes with the hamiltonian ; in turn , the use of this symmetry helps us in simplifying the study of this system .    to handle the above hamiltonian",
    ", we will assume a continuous approximation ( infrared limit ) ; that is to say , we shall use @xmath12  @xcite . in this way , it is possible to re - write the sum of eq .",
    "( [ eqhamilton ] ) as the integral @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a dimensionless variable used to denote the position in the chain ( i.e. the equivalent of @xmath3 ) , since we have not introduced so far the cell size of the circuit . in this approximation ,",
    "the hamiltonian becomes    @xmath15    where @xmath16 represents the hamiltonian density operator for the fields  @xmath17 and @xmath18 and where @xmath19=i\\hbar \\delta _ { x , x^{\\prime } } $ ] . from the above hamiltonian",
    "we find the equations of motion ( heisenberg equations ) :    @xmath20",
    "as stated previously , we are interested in wavefront - like solutions of the system of eqs.([eqsistema2]-[cuatro ] ) .",
    "we proceed in the standard way @xcite , by assuming travelling wave solutions for our operators , i.e. , we define a new variable @xmath21 , and assume    @xmath22    where @xmath23 stands for the unknown propagation velocity with dimensions of inverse time , since we did not introduce a grid length parameter in our continuum approximation .",
    "therefore , from the heisenberg equations of motion ( [ eqsistema2]-[cuatro ] ) , the wavefront equations in the new variable @xmath24 become    @xmath25    from the above pair of equations we obtain a closed equation for the pseudoflux operator resulting in the `` eigenvalue '' problem : @xmath26 where the integration constant has been chosen as zero by simplicity ( however , see eq .",
    "[ eq14 ] ) . equation ( [ eigenvalue ] ) corresponds to an eigenvalue problem for the non - linear super - operator @xmath27 .",
    "there is at least two kinds of solutions : a projection operator @xmath28 , satisfying @xmath29 , and @xmath30 satisfying @xmath31 . for simplicity",
    ", we shall consider only the first case ( a projector ) .",
    "consider the pseudoflux operator only in one lc - cell of the chain , and its spectral decomposition in the schrdinger picture @xmath32 .",
    "now , pick - up only one term from there ( call it @xmath33 , say ) and consider now the well - defined operator    @xmath34    where @xmath0 is an arbitrary pseudoflux parameter , and replace into eq .",
    "(  [ eigenvalue ] ) . at this point ,",
    "a note concerning the validity for the commutation rules may be in order : the projector operator @xmath35 defines a one dimensional subspace in which subspace the commutation rule between @xmath36 and the projected charge operator @xmath37 , is verified .",
    "now , since @xmath35 is a projector , then the equation for the pseudoflux @xmath0 becomes related to the velocity by    @xmath38    since both signs ( @xmath39 ) are possible , then we can construct the wavefront solution ( step @xmath40 ) of the equations of motion ( [ eqsistema2]-[cuatro ] ) :    @xmath41    corresponding to a solution with zero total flux ( sec .",
    "[ introd ] ) . concerning the matching condition at @xmath42 , the solution ( [ sol ] ) is in complete agreement with the matching implying explicitly eqs.([siete]-[ocho ] ) .",
    "the condition @xmath43 on the wave - front velocity gives the band - gap conditions on the system .",
    "in fact , from ( [ eqonce ] ) the restriction @xmath44 means that there exists a sequence of bands and gaps .",
    "the figure  [ velocidad ] shows a plot of the wavefront velocity ( [ eqonce ] ) for different values of the pseudoflux @xmath0 , in which it is seen an alternating sequence of bands and gaps , corresponding to propagating and forbidden modes .",
    "note that the main allowed band ( @xmath45 ) is twice as wide as the other allowed bands .",
    "recall that the integration constant was set equal to zero to obtain ( [ eigenvalue ] ) , now consider the nonzero case , then the wavefront velocity becomes formally @xmath46 where @xmath47 is an integration constant .",
    "[ figura1 ]",
    "we present some preliminary results concerning the stability of the solution  ( [ eqdiez ] ) ; a more detailed treatment is currently under consideration .",
    "consider now the perturbative solutions @xmath48 where the operators @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the perturbation and then , assumed with small eigenvalues .",
    "moreover , consider the well known perturbative expansion ( @xcite )    @xmath51    since @xmath52 and as said @xmath35 is a projector , then from the above equation ( and ( 3 - 4 ) ) we have the linear evolution equation for the perturbation @xmath49 :    @xmath53    we shall consider two cases :    1 .",
    "@xmath54 . here",
    "@xmath55=0 $ ] and then we have the linear wave equation @xmath56 and the perturbations are unstable when @xmath57 .",
    "2 .   @xmath58 in this case the wave equation becomes @xmath59 , and the perturbation is stable",
    ".    0.5 cm",
    "it is well known that the direct classical l - c transmission line ( related to equation  [ eqhamilton ] ) has associated a dual transmission line : in the direct line the interaction between cells is through capacitances , while in the dual it is through inductances .",
    "the dual line is closely related to the so - called _ left - handed _ materials , and then its quantization is actually important . moreover ,",
    "the role of charge discreteness must be also considered .",
    "this two step process ( quantization and charge discreetness ) could be realized in analogy with the direct line ( section  [ introd ] ) but in this case long range interactions between cells appear in the hamiltonian .",
    "in fact , the expression for the hamiltonian is ( @xcite ) :    @xmath60    the equation of motion the charge and pseudoflux may be obtained after some algebra .",
    "we shall not continue the description of the dual line , but we shall only mention here that the expressions are quite involved and , so far , no explicit solution have been found .",
    "the cirquiton hamiltonian ( [ eqhamilton ] ) gives the equations of motion for charge  and pseudo - flux in the cell @xmath61    @xmath62    @xmath63    equations ( [ eqsistema2]-[cuatro ] ) in section [ introd ] are the spatially continuous version of the above pair of equations .",
    "then , for the pseudo - flux operator we have the closed non linear equation of motion : @xmath64 which , in the formal limit @xmath9 gives the usual one - band system with frequency spectrum @xmath65 , as expected .",
    "consider now the equation :    @xmath66    then any hermitian solution of this last equation is also solution of the cirquiton equation ( [ cirquiton ] ) . to show this",
    ", it suffices to conjugate eq .",
    "( [ qtoda ] ) and subtracting .",
    "notice that any hermitian solution of eq.([qtoda ] ) is also a solution of ( [ cirquiton ] ) , but the inverse is not necessarily true .",
    "on the other hand , the broad field related to the toda lattice is studied in depth in a variety of branches in physics @xcite including non - linear physics , statistical mechanics , classical electric circuits , etc .",
    "the classical evolution equation for the toda lattice has the generic form :    @xmath67    where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are real constant .",
    "so , we have the important result : the formal replacement @xmath70 transforms ( [ qtoda ] ) into the ( quantum ) toda lattice equation .",
    "this makes a direct connection between toda lattice and cirquiton theory .",
    "for the quantum electric transmission line with charge discreteness described by the hamiltonian eq.([eqhamilton ] ) , and equations of motion ( [ eqsistema2]-[cuatro ] ) , a one parameter ( @xmath0 ) wavefront solution was found ( eqs .",
    "[ eqonce]-[sol ] ) . the condition eq.([eqonce ] ) on the velocity generates a band - gap structure dependent on the pseudoflux parameter @xmath0 ( see figure  [ velocidad ] ) , namely , there exist regions ( values of @xmath0 ) for which a solitary wavefront propagates with constant speed .",
    "the existence of the band - gap structure described is the main result of this work .",
