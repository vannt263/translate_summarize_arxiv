    "the undirected analogue of conjecture  [ conj : neumann - lara ] is false , because it is equivalent to _",

    "( which is false )",
    ". however , the following remains open :    [ conj : albertson - berman ] every simple undirected planar graph of order @xmath0 has an induced forest of order at least @xmath3 .",
    "there are many graphs showing that conjecture  [ conj : albertson - berman ] , if true , is best - possible , e.g. , @xmath9 and the octahedron .",
    "the best - known lower bound for the order of a largest induced forest in a planar graph is @xmath10 and follows from borodin s result on acyclic vertex - coloring of undirected planar graphs  @xcite .",

    "our result implies that , if true , the lower bound of @xmath3 in albertson s question is best possible .",
    "in particular it disproves conjecture  [ conj : harutyunyan ] .",
    "we show the corresponding statement for feedback vertex sets . indeed , a little stronger , we show that for any @xmath5 and @xmath12 there is an oriented planar graph @xmath13 such that : @xmath13 has digirth @xmath5 , order @xmath14 , and a minimum vertex feedback set of size @xmath12 .",

    "see figure  [ fig : dessin ] .      since in @xmath20",
    "no minimum feedback vertex set uses both @xmath15 and @xmath16 , in order to hit the two newly created directed cycles , an additional vertex @xmath26 is needed .",
    "thus , @xmath13 has a minimum feedback vertex set of size at least @xmath12 .",
    "now , choosing @xmath27 , indeed gives a feedback vertex set of size @xmath12 .",
    "thus , in @xmath13 there is no minimum feedback vertex containing two vertices from @xmath28 .",
    "since each such pair of vertices lies on a newly created common face , it only remains to check the order of @xmath13 . since we added a total of @xmath29 new vertices",
    ", @xmath13 has @xmath30 vertices , i.e. , @xmath31 .",
    "thus , the largest acyclic set in @xmath13 is of size @xmath32 .    by theorem  [ thm : ub ] , for even @xmath0 , an acyclic set in a planar oriented graph of digirth @xmath33",
    "is of size at most @xmath34 .",
    "a computer check , using tools from sage  @xcite , shows that there are 9 planar triangulations with @xmath0 vertices ( @xmath0 is even and @xmath35 ) that are tight examples for conjecture  [ conj : albertson - berman ] .",
    "furthermore , for all orientations of these examples , the largest directed acyclic set is of size at least @xmath34 .",
    "we wonder if the following is true :    if a largest induced forest in a simple undirected planar graph @xmath36 on @xmath0 vertices is of size @xmath37 , then for every orientation @xmath2 of @xmath36 there is an acyclic set of size at least @xmath38 ."
