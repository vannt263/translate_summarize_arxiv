    "the study of induced chern - simons terms in @xmath2-dimensional field theory at finite temperature has produced some interesting new insights @xcite into the relationships between large gauge invariance , effective actions and induced charges at finite temperature .",
    "the simplest example of an induced chern - simons term arises in the computation of the one - fermion - loop gauge self - energy in @xmath3 .",
    "the chern - simons coefficient is extracted from the zero - momentum limit of the parity violating part of this self - energy @xcite . at finite t , this procedure is not unique @xcite since feynman diagrams are not analytic in external momenta at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "this is because the thermal heat bath breaks lorentz invariance , so that diagrams depend separately on the energy @xmath4 and the spatial momentum @xmath5 . in a static limit , with @xmath6 and @xmath7 ,",
    "an induced chern - simons term is found with a temperature dependent coefficient @xcite .",
    "as first pointed out in @xcite , this result appears ( when carried over to a nonabelian theory ) to violate large gauge invariance since the coefficient of the induced chern - simons term in a nonabelian theory should take discrete values @xcite .",
    "this puzzle has been resolved for the cases when the background has the character of a static magnetic field with integer flux @xmath8 ( as is appropriate for comparison with the static limit ) , because in this case the problem factorizes into @xmath8 copies of an exactly solvable @xmath9-dimensional model @xcite .",
    "then one finds that the finite temperature effective action has an infinite series of parity - violating terms ( of which the chern - simons term is only the first ) , each of which has a t dependent coefficient at finite t. nevertheless , the series is such that the full effective action changes under a large gauge transformation in a manner that is independent of t. these new parity - violating terms are non - extensive ( i.e. , they are not integrals of a density ) and they explicitly vanish at zero temperature ( as they must since the zero t effective action should be extensive ) .",
    "this issue is considerably more difficult to resolve in genuinely time - dependent backgrounds , although presumably it should be true that the full finite t effective action is invariant under large gauge transformations that have non - zero winding number .    with this as motivation",
    ", we propose here to study an extreme non - static limit of @xmath2-dimensional qed obtained by making a dimensional reduction so that all fields are spatially uniform ( i.e. @xmath10 ) , but time dependent ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "this dimensional reduction leads to a @xmath9-dimensional field theory ( i.e. quantum mechanics ) that inherits many of the features of the @xmath2-dimensional model , such as chern - simons terms , time - reversal violation , an analogue of parity violation , and global @xmath12 flavor symmetry @xcite .",
    "however , this dimensionally reduced @xmath9-dimensional model is very different from the @xmath9 model considered in @xcite .",
    "rather , our dimensionally reduced model is very similar to chern - simons quantum mechanics @xcite , but now coupled to spinor fields .",
    "surprisingly , we find that the interactions induce a chern - simons terms at finite t , and from the self - energy diagram we find a coefficient @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the fermion mass , just as in @xmath2 dimensions . moreover , the scalar fields are now dynamical and so it is possible to go beyond the one - loop level .",
    "however , the analogy with @xmath3 is not perfect ; for example , by suppressing all spatial fluctuation degrees of freedom we have lost local gauge invariance - instead we are left with a type of yukawa model .",
    "nevertheless , the model displays a remarkably rich renormalization structure , at both zero and non - zero temperature .    in section",
    "ii we introduce the dimensionally reduced model and its symmetry properties . in section iii",
    "we calculate the exact one - fermion - loop scalar effective action for the special case where there are no @xmath13 violating bare masses .",
    "section iv introduces the finite temperature propagators , and in sections v and vi we compute the one - loop scalar self - energy and multi - leg diagrams contributing to the effective action . in section vii",
    "we calculate the one - loop fermion self - energy , and in section viii we present some two - loop results .",
    "section ix contains some concluding remarks .",
    "consider the @xmath2 dimensional lagrange density for quantum electrodynamics together with a chern - simons term : @xmath14 here , the electric and magnetic fields are @xmath15 , and @xmath16 , respectively , and @xmath17 is a two - component complex spinor field .",
    "the dirac matrices are chosen to be @xmath18 which satisfy @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the minkowski metric @xmath21 .",
    "note that both the fermion mass term @xmath22 and the chern - simons term @xmath23 break the discrete symmetries of parity @xmath24 and time reversal @xmath13 in @xmath2 dimensions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as is well known , a chern - simons term for the gauge field can be induced radiatively at zero temperature , as the one - fermion loop gauge self - energy acquires a @xmath24-odd and @xmath13-odd contribution @xcite . at finite temperature",
    "this calculation is more complicated , as was discussed in the introduction .",
    "now consider a dimensional reduction of the model described by the lagrange density ( [ lag3 ] ) , defined by taking all fields to be spatially constant . in other words , all momenta @xmath5 are set equal to zero .",
    "this reduces to a lagrangian for a @xmath9 dimensional model : @xmath25 in this spatially constant limit , the non - dynamical field @xmath26 reduces to a constant chemical potential @xmath27 .",
    "the vector potential @xmath28 becomes a pair of scalar fields @xmath29 , with a lorentz - force term @xmath30 inherited from the chern - simons mass term , and a yukawa interaction @xmath31 with the two - component spinor @xmath32 .    the dimensionally reduced system with lagrangian ( [ lag ] )",
    "retains some interesting symmetry properties .",
    "the first is a global rotational invariance , with infinitesimal transformations @xmath33 where @xmath34 is constant .",
    "this clearly leaves each term in the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) invariant .    the @xmath9-dimensional model in ( [ lag ] )",
    "possesses remnants of the behavior of the @xmath3 lagrangian ( [ lag3 ] ) under discrete symmetries @xcite .",
    "time reversal acts as @xmath35 this leaves invariant the chemical potential term @xmath36 , but changes the sign of the mass term @xmath37 .",
    "similarly , the chern - simons term @xmath38 changes sign under @xmath13 .",
    "the yukawa interaction term remains invariant ( recall that @xmath13 is an antiunitary operation , for which @xmath39 ) .",
    "all these properties mirror exactly the behavior of the @xmath2 model .",
    "the @xmath9 model also inherits a charge conjugation symmetry from the @xmath2 model : @xmath40 under this generalized charge conjugation operation @xmath41 , the chemical potential term @xmath36 changes sign , while the mass term @xmath37 is invariant ( recall that the @xmath42 are anticommuting fermi fields ) .",
    "finally , this model also inherits another discrete symmetry , which we still call `` parity '' ( although there is no spatial reflection involved ) , from the parity symmetry of the @xmath2 model : @xmath43 this symmetry is broken by the fermion mass term @xmath37 and the chern - simons term @xmath44 , but not by the chemical potential term @xmath36 .    we can also identify a global @xmath12 flavor symmetry of the model ( [ lag ] ) , in analogy to the situation in @xmath2 dimensions @xcite .",
    "irreducible _ dirac matrix in @xmath9 dimensions is just a number : @xmath45 .",
    "but by reducing from @xmath2 we have effectively doubled the fermionic degrees of freedom ( so that we can interpret @xmath46 and @xmath47 as two flavors ) and defined a _",
    "reducible _ dirac matrix @xmath48 .",
    "there then exist two other @xmath49 matrices that anticommute with @xmath50 , and taken together the set @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 generates a global @xmath12 flavor symmetry .",
    "this is exactly analogous to the situation in @xmath2 dimensions where we can double the degrees of freedom taking reducible @xmath55 dirac matrices and two fermion flavors @xcite .",
    "this global flavor symmetry acts on the fields as ( infinitesimally ) @xmath56 this flavor symmetry is broken @xmath57 by the fermion mass term @xmath37 , but is preserved by the chemical potential term @xmath36 . once again",
    ", this mimics the behavior of the @xmath2 dimensional model .",
    "in the absence of the bare @xmath13-violating mass terms @xmath37 and @xmath44 , it is possible to compute the _ exact _ finite temperature one - fermion - loop effective action for the scalar fields @xmath58 .",
    "note that the background @xmath58 is manifestly non - static . in this section",
    "we consider the bare lagrangian ( obtained from ( [ lag ] ) by setting @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) @xmath61 integrating out the fermion fields , the one - loop effective action is @xmath62=-i \\log \\left[{\\det(i\\partial_0+\\mu+e\\gamma^0\\gamma^ia_i)\\over \\det(i\\partial_0+\\mu)}\\right ] \\label{eff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can simplify the evaluation of @xmath63 $ ] by the following nonlinear field redefinition : @xmath64 then the lagrangian simplifies to a free lagrangian @xmath65 . at finite temperature ,",
    "if we work in the imaginary time formalism , the original fermion fields satisfy antiperiodic boundary conditions : @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the inverse temperature .",
    "therefore , the transformed fields @xmath68 have boundary conditions : @xmath69 this boundary condition may be imposed , for a given background @xmath58 , by using a `` chemical potential '' @xmath70 where @xmath71 thus , the evaluation of the effective action ( [ eff ] ) reduces to the evaluation of the logarithm of the determinant of the operator @xmath72 with anti - periodic boundary conditions . here",

    "several comments are in order concerning the result ( [ exact ] ) .",
    "first , notice that there is no sign of any @xmath13-violating terms being generated .",
    "this is not surprising , since the bare lagrangian ( [ tlag ] ) considered in this section contains neither a fermion mass term nor a chern - simons term .",
    "second , this finite temperature effective action involves non - extensive terms , as had also been found in the finite temperature static limit @xcite .",
    "in fact , the result ( [ exact ] ) can be expanded as a series in even powers of the integral @xmath77 . at zero temperature , where the effective action must be extensive , the effective action vanishes , by a cancellation of extensive terms @xmath77 with opposite signs .",
    "while it is interesting to observe the presence of non - extensive terms in the finite temperature effective action for the @xmath13-preserving lagrangian ( [ tlag ] ) , it is more interesting to consider the possibility of the radiative generation of @xmath13-violating terms at finite temperature .",
    "we expect that this phenomenon may occur if we include the @xmath13-violating bare masses @xmath1 and/or @xmath78 that appear in the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) . but the effective action for this system is not exactly solvable .",
    "thus we must resort to finite temperature perturbation theory @xcite . since we are considering non - static backgrounds",
    "@xmath29 it is more direct to use the real - time formalism .",
    "we will present the calculations in both coordinate space and in momentum space .",
    "the finite t propagators simplify considerably in @xmath9 dimensions , due to the simplicity of the dispersion relation . for the fermion fields ,",

    "this is not the case , a reflection of the fact that our dimensionally reduced model does not have local gauge invariance .",
    "we have also computed the two - loop fermion self - energy , but the final expression is long and we do not present it here . note that because of the vanishing of the one - loop vertex correction , the overlapping diagram in figure [ f10](b ) is identically zero .",
    "the remaining two diagrams in figure [ f10 ] are straightforward to evaluate given the one - loop results already presented .",
    "finally we mention that while the one - loop vertex correction ( see figure [ f7 ] ) is zero , at the two - loop level there is in fact one non - zero vertex diagram , shown in figure [ f11 ] .",
    "all other two - loop vertex diagrams vanish .",
    "in this paper we have studied an extreme non - static limit of @xmath2-dimensional qed obtained by making a dimensional reduction so that all fields are spatially uniform ( i.e. @xmath10 ) , but time dependent ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath9-dimensional field theory inherits many of the features of @xmath3 , such as chern - simons terms , time - reversal violation , an analogue of parity violation , and global @xmath12 flavor symmetry .",
    "we found that at finite temperature the interactions induce a radiative chern - simons mass as well as a @xmath13-even mass , and from the self - energy diagram we find that each is proportional to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the fermion mass .",
    "multi - leg diagrams contain non - extensive contributions at finite t , but it does not appear possible to re - sum exactly the effective action , except in the special case in which there are no bare @xmath13-violating masses to begin with .",
    "this is indicative of the difficulty of analyzing the finite temperature @xmath2 model in non - static backgrounds .",
    "we have computed the two loop scalar and fermion self - energies , and we find that these are non - zero . indeed , they are even non - zero at zero temperature .",
    "this does not violate the coleman - hill theorem @xcite since in our non - static limit we have suppressed local gauge invariance .",
    "it would be interesting to study supersymmetry breaking due to temperature effects in this model - the model itself is not supersymmetric , but could be made so by the suitable inclusion of additional fields .",
