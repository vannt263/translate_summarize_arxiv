    "graphene has attracted enormous attention due to its extraordinary electronic , optical , thermal and mechanical properties , and immense potentials for nanoelectronic applications @xcite .",
    "this single - atom thick , @xmath0-hybridized allotrope of carbon with a perfectly @xmath1 confinement of its electronic states is a zero - gap semi - metal , exhibiting a linear dispersion relation @xmath2 = @xmath3 near the meeting point of its conical valence and conduction bands ( the dirac point ) @xcite .",
    "graphene can conduct much higher current densities than currently used cu interconnects in the integrated circuits ( ics ) @xcite .",
    "graphene also exhibits much higher carrier mobilities compared to the conventional field - effect - transistor ( fet ) channel materials such as si and iii - vs @xcite .",
    "these unique electronic properties make graphene one of the most promising candidate materials for both transistors and interconnects in future ics @xcite .    for many practical applications , such as in nanoelectronic devices , graphene needs to be patterened into the so - called graphene nanoribbons ( gnrs ) .",
    "typically graphene is patterned by selectively removing the material by physical etching techniques .",
    "graphene can also be patterned by selective chemical functionalization with hydrogen @xcite or fluorine @xcite , which results in graphene nanostructures embedded in functionalized graphene : typically a wide bandgap insulator .",
    "the electronic properties of gnrs are very sensitive to their width and edge geometry @xcite .",
    "the dependence of edge geometry on the electronic structure of gnrs has been mainly investigated using theoretical approaces such as the tight - binding model and density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "theoretical studies indicate that the band gap of single layer armchair gnrs ( agnrs ) is extremely sensitive to their width @xcite .",
    "antiferromagnetic ordering at the edges of zigzag gnrs ( zgnrs ) opens up a band gap while ferromagnetically ordered zgnrs do not have a band gap @xcite .",
    "the band gap in both agnrs and zgnrs can be controlled by an external electric field @xcite .",
    "experimental observations of these theoretical predictions remain ilusive due to the challenging task of atomically precise control of the gnr edges .",
    "the available state - of - the - art transport measurements @xcite are performed on gnrs with width on the order of @xmath4 , however their edges are rough making direct quantitative comparison with theory difficult . the experimental techniques , however , keep on improving at a rapid pace . for example , the magnetic ordering at the edges predicted by dft calculations @xcite has been recently observed in gnrs with ultrasmooth edges @xcite .",
    "layer stacking provides an additional handle to tune the electronic properties of graphene and gnrs through interlayer interactions .",
    "the effect of layer stacking in graphene has been extensively studied theoretically @xcite .",
    "recent experiments have demonstrated tuning of electronic properties of graphene by layer stacking .",
    "for example , ( i ) a band gap can be opened up in a bi - layer graphene by applying an electric field @xcite , ( ii ) tri - layer graphene behaves like a semimetal in the presence of an electric field @xcite , and ( iii ) multilayer graphene shows a peculiar conductivity spectra depending on the number of layers @xcite .",
    "there have been several theoretical studies on the electronic structure of bilayer gnrs @xcite , however , similar studies beyond bi - layer stacking are lacking except ref .",
    "@xcite , where the effects of geometry relaxation were not included .    in this paper",
    ", we report an investigation of the effect of layer - stacking on the electronic structure of armchair and zigzag gnrs using _ ab initio _ density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "interlayer van der waals interactions are included to accurately model the effects of geometry relaxation on the electronic structure .",
    "the width and thickness dependence of the electronic structure of multilayer agnrs is discussed first , then the energetics of geometry relaxation and magnetic ordering and their effects on the electronic structure of multilayer zgnrs are discussed .",
    "it should be pointed out here that dft based calculations underestimate the band gap of gnrs and perturbative correction schemes such as the gw method should be used to obtain accurate estimates @xcite .",
    "gw calculations are computationally much more expensive compared to dft .",
    "since the primary goal here is to study the evolution of electronic structure as a function of the number of layers rather than quantitatively estimate the band gaps of stacked gnrs , we have used the computationally less expensive dft scheme for most of the calculations .",
    "the more accurate gw corrected band gaps are calculated for single and bi - layer gnrs to provide an estimate of the quasiparticle corrections in these nanostructures .",
    "the atomistic schematics of simulated bi - layer agnrs and zgnrs with ab bernal stacking are shown in  [ fig : agnr_zgnr_atoms](a ) and  [ fig : agnr_zgnr_atoms](b ) respectively . for three and more layers aba and abab ... stackings are used .",
    "an interlayer distance of @xmath5   ( same as graphite ) is used as a starting point in the geometry optimization .",
    "edges of gnrs are passivated with hydrogen .",
    "henceforth 1 - 8 layers thick gnrs are referred as few - layer gnrs while multilayer gnr refers to a gnr obtained by applying periodic boundary condition to a bilayer gnr in the thickness direction .",
    "the electronic structure of agnrs is discussed first .",
    "the band structure of a single - layer and a tri - layer agnr-7 is shown in  [ fig : agnr_stack_bands_gaps](a ) and  [ fig : agnr_stack_bands_gaps](b ) respectively .",
    "as the three agnr-7 layers are moved closer to form a tri - layer agnr-7 , the 3-fold band degeneracy is lifted due to the interlayer coupling and the band gap is reduced . thus the degenerate bands in each of the three single - layer agnr-7 results in three non - degenerate bands in a tri - layer agnr-7 .",
    "all few - layer agnrs show a similar band structure evolution . as shown in  [ fig : agnr_stack_bands_gaps](e ) , the band gap of agnr-7 gradually decreases as the number of layers increases and shows a tendency to approach the multilayer agnr-7 limit .",
    "the comparison of the band structures of tri - layer agnr-7 (  [ fig : agnr_stack_bands_gaps](b ) ) , agnr-8 (  [ fig : agnr_stack_bands_gaps](c ) ) , and agnr-9 (  [ fig : agnr_stack_bands_gaps](d ) ) illustrates the fact that similar to single - layer agnrs tri - layer agnrs show three classes ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 denotes the number of carbon chains along the width and @xmath10 is an integer ) of band structures depending on their width .",
    "similar to agnr-7 , agnr-8 and agnr-9 show convergence of the band gap to the multilayer limit (  [ fig : agnr_stack_bands_gaps](e ) ) .",
    "this classification was recently reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for upto 4-layer thick agnrs .",
    "[ fig : agnr_stack_bands_gaps](e ) indicates that this classification persists beyond 4 layers .",
    "the gw corrected band gaps of single- and bilayer agnrs are also shown in  [ fig : agnr_stack_bands_gaps](e ) .",
    "large quasiparticle corrections on the order of @xmath11 are attributed to enhanced coulomb effects @xcite .",
    "compared to bulk , gnrs are under confinement and have greatly reduced screening , which enhance the coulomb effects .",
    "the quasiparticle corrections for bilayer agnrs are smaller compared to single - layer agnrs .",
    "this is because each layer screens the coulomb interactions in another layer reducing the overall coulomb effects @xcite .",
    "zgnrs show an edge magnetism , which can have multiple configurations depending on relative in - layer and interlayer spin polarizations @xcite .",
    "the two possible spin polarizations in a single - layer zgnr are ( i ) ferromagnetic ( fm ) in - layer and ( ii ) antiferromagnetic ( af ) in - layer while multilayer zgnrs can have several possible spin polarizations .",
    "the four spin polarizations in multilayer zgnrs investigated here are ( i ) fm - fm : fm in - layer and fm interlayer , ( ii ) af - fm : af in - layer and fm interlayer , ( iii ) fm - af : fm in - layer and af interlayer , and ( iv ) af - af : af in - layer and af interlayer .",
    "multilayer zgnrs initialized in configurations ( iii ) and ( iv ) stay in those configurations while multilayer zgnrs initialized in configurations ( i ) and ( ii ) converge to configuration ( iv ) , which indicates that the fm interlayer coupling is not as stable as the af interlayer coupling .",
    "@xcite also reported that the af interlayer coupling has lower energy compared to the fm interlayer coupling .",
    "therefore , af interlayer coupling is used in all zgnr electronic structure calculations presented in this article .",
    "the relaxation energy ( _ i.e. _ difference between total energy of relaxed and unrelaxed ) zgnrs as a function of the number of layers is plotted in  [ fig : zgnr_energetics](a ) . both non - magnetic ( nm ) and",
    "magnetically ordered zgnrs show similar trends in the relaxation energy as a function of the number of layers . due to the interlayer van der waals attraction ,",
    "the top and bottom layers show a concave curvature while the other layers remain more or less flat .",
    "similar curvatures were reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for the bi - layer zgnr .",
    "this concave curvature is the main cause of the reduction in total energy of the relaxed few - layer zgnrs .",
    "the relaxation energy of the single - layer zgnr is negligible because of the absence of curvature .",
    "[ fig : zgnr_energetics](b ) shows the magnetic stabilization energy ( @xmath12 ) of unrelaxed zgnrs resulting only from the fm - af and af - af orderings at the edges .",
    "zgnrs with af - af and fm - af orderings both show similar trends as a function of the number of layers such that zgnrs with af in - layer configuration are lower in energy compared to zgnrs with fm in - layer coupling .",
    "@xmath13 is much smaller in zgnrs with two or more layers compared to the single - layer zgnr .",
    "this implies that the interlayer interations weaken the strength of magnetic ordering in each layer of the few - layer zgnrs @xcite .",
    "the interlayer interactions become stronger in relaxed zgnrs because of the concave curvature in the top and bottom layers .",
    "this further weakens the strength of in - layer magnetic coupling , which results in lower energy difference between magnetic and non - magnetic states of relaxed zgnrs compared to unrelaxed zgnrs  [ fig : zgnr_energetics](b , c ) .",
    "the bi - layer zgnrs initialized in both the fm - af and af - af configurations converge to a non - magnetic ground state when the geometry relaxation is allowed . therefore in the bi - layer zgnr",
    ", there is no reduction in the total energy due to the magnetic ordering  [ fig : zgnr_energetics](c ) .",
    "@xcite , which included van der waals interactions also reported that the ground state of bi - layer zgnrs is non - magnetic . in the calculations , where the geometry relaxation is not included ,",
    "the bi - layer zgnrs initialized in the fm - af and af - af configurations stay in those configurations and do not converge to a non - magnetic ground state  [ fig : zgnr_energetics](b ) .",
    "the calculated @xmath13 of relaxed zgnrs ( [ fig : zgnr_energetics](c ) ) is comparable to the thermal energy at room temperature ( @xmath14 ) , which indicates that magnetic ordering is unstable at room temperature .",
    "the layer stacking destabilizes edge magnetism by reducing @xmath13 .",
    "the roughness and reconstruction at the zgnr edges further destabilize the magnetic ordering even at low temperatures .",
    "thus the magnetic ordering is expected to manifest at low temperatures in single - layer zgnrs with atomically smooth edges .",
    "indeed the edge magnetism was observed recently at low temperatures in gnrs with atomically smooth edges slightly offset from an ideal zig - zag edge @xcite .",
    "the band structures of 1 - 4 layer thick relaxed zgnrs in the non - magnetic , af - af , and fm - af configurations are shown in  [ fig : nonmag_afaf_fmaf_1_4_bands ] .",
    "non - magnetic zgnrs have nearly flat bands near the fermi level ( @xmath15 ) leading to high density of states ( dos ) near @xmath15 .",
    "the bands near @xmath15 are mainly composed of the edge states .",
    "the high dos near @xmath15 gives rise to magnetic instability and the edge states become spin - polarized @xcite .",
    "the up and down spin states in zgnrs with af - af ordering at the edges are degenerate while they are split in zgnrs with fm - af ordering .",
    "the af in - layer coupling at the edges opens up a band gap while fm in - layer coupling does not .",
    "the band structures of 5 - 8 layer thick relaxed zgnrs are not shown here but are qualitatively similar .",
    "the band structures of the bi - layer zgnr in the af - af (  [ fig : nonmag_afaf_fmaf_1_4_bands](f ) ) and fm - af (  [ fig : nonmag_afaf_fmaf_1_4_bands](j ) ) configurations are identical to non - magnetic band structure (  [ fig : nonmag_afaf_fmaf_1_4_bands](b ) ) because the bi - layer zgnrs initialized in those configurations converge to the non - magnetic ground state after geometry relaxation .    in the presence of the magnetic ordering at the edges , the non - magnetic bands in zgnrs",
    "are only slightly perturbed except the bands near @xmath15 .",
    "although the band structures of zgnrs with even and odd number of layers look almost similar , they are different near @xmath15 and the brillouin zone edge .",
    "non - magnetic zgnrs with odd number of layers have nearly flat bands crossing @xmath15 (  [ fig : nonmag_afaf_fmaf_1_4_bands](a , c ) ) .",
    "such bands are not present in non - magnetic zgnrs with even number of layers .",
    "this property is reminiscent of the different electronic structure of graphene multilayers , where dirac fermions with a linear dispersion are present in graphene with odd number of layers while only normal fermions with a parabolic dispersion are present in graphene with even number of layers @xcite . upon magnetic",
    "ordering at the zgnr edges , the splitting of the bands crossing @xmath15 is higher compared to the other flat bands slightly away from @xmath15 .",
    "the bandstructures of zgnrs with 4 or more layers are in close agreement with each other irrespective of their magnetic ordering ( [ fig : nonmag_afaf_fmaf_1_4_bands](d , h , l ) ) .",
    "this is also reflected in their total energies in  [ fig : zgnr_energetics](c ) , where the energy difference between non - magnetic , af - af , and fm - af orderings become very small as the number of layers increases beyond 3 .",
    "the band gap of zgnrs as a function of the number of layers is shown in  [ fig : afaf_afaf_flat_bandgap ] .",
    "as discussed earlier , only zgnrs with af - af ordering and a non - magnetic bilayer zgnr have a band gap .",
    "relaxed zgnrs have a smaller band gap compared to unrelaxed zgnrs .",
    "the gw corrected band structures of a relaxed single - layer zgnr with af in - layer ordering and relaxed bi - layer zgnr , which has a non - magnetic ground state are shown in  [ fig : nonmag_afaf_fmaf_1_4_bands](e , f ) .",
    "the gw corrected band gaps of single- and bilayer zgnrs are also shown in  [ fig : afaf_afaf_flat_bandgap ] .",
    "the quasiparticle corrections for unrelaxed bilayer af - af zgnr are smaller compared to unrelaxed single - layer zgnr with af in - layer ordering because each layer screens the coulomb interactions in another layer reducing the overall coulomb effects @xcite .",
    "both the dft and gw band gaps of a non - magnetic relaxed bilayer zgnr are much smaller compared to unrelaxed bilayer zgnr with af - af ordering .",
    "since the electronic structure of zgnrs is mainly determined by the edge states @xcite , zgnrs with different widths are expected to show similar electronic structure evolution with the number of layers as zgnr-8 discussed here .",
    "ultra - narrow zgnrs may show different electronic structure evolution due to strong interedge interactions .",
    "to summarize , the evolution of electronic properties of gnrs as a function of the number of layers stacked together is studied using dft including van der waals interactions .",
    "multilayer agnrs , similar to single - layer agnrs , are found to exhibit three classes of band gaps depending on their width . in zgnrs ,",
    "the af interlayer coupling is more stable compared to the fm interlayer coupling .",
    "zgnrs with the fm in - layer and af interlayer coupling do not have a band gap while zgnrs with the af in - layer and af interlayer coupling have a finite band gap , which decreases with increasing the number of layers .",
    "the magnetic stabilization energy decreases as the number of layers increases indicating that the magnetic ordering is less stable in multilayer zgnrs compared to single - layer zgnrs .",
    "the ground state of the bi - layer zgnr is found to be non - magnetic with a small but finite band gap .",
    "the dft calculations , which do not include geometry relaxation can not predict the non - magnetic ground state of a bi - layer zgnr and overestimate the band gap of multilayer zgnrs in af - af configuration .",
    "the gw calculations on single- and bilayer gnrs indicate that the quasiparticle band gap corrections decrease with increasing number of layers due to the reduction in coulomb effects .",
    "the electronic structure calculations are performed within the framework of first - principles density functional theory as implemented in the vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package ( vasp ) code @xcite .",
