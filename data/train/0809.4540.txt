    "we can choose the renormalization scale @xmath5 of order of this characteristic energy scale .",
    "then there will be no large logarithms in perturbative series , and truncating such series will produce small errors . if we try to consider the same process in the full theory , there is a second scale @xmath3 , and no choice of @xmath5 allows us to get rid of large logarithms .",
    "also , each extra scale in feynman diagrams ( with loops ) makes their calculation much more difficult technically .    heavy quark effective theory ( hqet )",

    "various methods of multiloop calculations are presented in the excellent book  @xcite in great detail , most of these methods are used in hqet .",
    "we are going to consider a class of qcd problems involving a single heavy quark with ( on - shell ) mass @xmath7 .",

    "we can even change the magnitude of the heavy - quark spin ( e.g. , to switch it off ) without changing physics  this supersymmetry group is called superflavour symmetry .",
