    "the onset of giant exoplanet transit science , initiated by the discovery of hd209458b @xcite , immediately revealed unexpected anomalous radii for several hot jupiters .",
    "the so - called inflated radii became common as new transiting hot jupiters were discovered .",
    "the anomalous giant planet radii were unexpected because in the mass regime of giant planets , the mass - radius relationship for giant planets was expected to be unique @xcite , assuming a given composition .",
    "moreover , the compensating effects of electron degeneracy and electrostatic contribution from the classical ions yield a quasi - constant radius around 1 and 7 @xmath4 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "soon after the discovery of 51pegb @xcite , @xcite correctly pointed out that strongly irradiated giant planets do not follow the same mass - radius relationship than the one of isolated objects .",
    "more than 100 known transiting hot jupiters later , planet radius discrepancies are still common ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "despite numerous theoretical studies ( see , e.g .",
    "* for a review ) , no universal mechanism seems to fully account for the observed radii anomalies .",
    "the motivation of the present work is that most of the proposed mechanisms to explain inflated radii are expected to become less effective as the stellar incident flux decreases ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore study a _ kepler _",
    "subsample of 138 giant planets candidates to better understand the effect of irradiation across a wide range of orbital separation on giant extrasolar planets radii .",
    "we further note that transiting giant planets receiving modest stellar irradiation are particularly important for the derivation of their internal structure and composition , as the interior energy source is expected to affect the planetary radius only nominally @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first describe in sect .  2 how the sample of giant planet candidates was chosen",
    ". then we present the data analysis that refined the system parameters and provided constraints on planethood of the candidates .",
    "the results of this analysis are then shown in sect .",
    "we finally discuss the behavior of the _ kepler _ giant planet candidates in the radii vs. stellar incident flux plane and estimate the _ kepler _ false positive rate for this class of objects in sect .",
    "this study is based on quarters q0 , q1 and q2 _ kepler _ data that were publicly released on 2011 february 1st @xcite . in total , the datasets encompass 136 days of photometric monitoring between may and september 2009 .    a list of 1235 _ kepler _ objects of interest ( koi ) was released , unveiling a huge diversity of exoplanet candidates in terms of planetary radii and orbital periods .",
    "one of the key elements of this release is the relatively low occurrence of jupiter - sized candidates ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . out of the 1235 planet candidates ,",
    "only about 15% have radii above 0.6@xmath5 , a result that supports the low frequency of giant planets found in rv surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , albeit for a different stellar population .",
    "our primary selection criterion is the planetary radius .",
    "@xcite announced 165 giant planet candidates with 6@xmath6 and 19 candidates with 15@xmath7 for a total of 184 objects .",
    "we further restricted this sample to keep only `` giant '' planet candidates , defined here by 8@xmath7 .",
    "this step yielded 138 candidates .",
    "we removed the 14 koi that have only one transit in q0-q2 and 9 other classified as  moderate \" candidates , likely false positives , that exhibit centroid motion or difference of depth between odd and even transits @xcite .",
    "this selection left us with a sample of 115 giant planet candidates .",
    "for each of the 115 koi , we retrieved the q0-q2 raw long - cadence photometry @xcite from mast .",
    "these data include all photometry in the form of individual lightcurves .",
    "we used the raw photometry instead of the kepler - corrected ( pdc ) @xcite photometry so that we could identify systematics on specific timescales as necessary input to our analysis .",
    "moreover , by using the raw data we can assess the amplitude of correlated noise ( from instrumental systematics and stellar variability combined ) to derive uncertainties on stellar and planetary parameters .    to better characterize the 115 planet candidates , we performed individual markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) analysis for each koi .",
    "the aim of this analysis was two - fold .",
    "the first goal was to remove false positives by way of detecting a robust secondary eclipse signal indicative of a stellar companion instead of a planetary companion .",
    "the second goal was to derive the stellar density from the transit lightcurve in order to further derive the stellar parameters and planetary radius .",
    "this step also required use of the stellar @xmath8 values drawn from the _ kepler _ input catalog ( kic ; * ? ? ?",
    "we used the implementation of the mcmc algorithm presented in @xcite in order to derive the stellar and planetary parameters .",
    "mcmc is a bayesian inference method based on stochastic simulations that samples the posterior probability distributions of adjusted parameters for a given model .",
    "our mcmc implementation uses the gibbs sampler and the metropolis - hastings algorithm to estimate the posterior distribution function of all jump parameters .",
    "our nominal model is based on a star and a transiting planet on a keplerian orbit about their center of mass .",
    "input data provided to each mcmc consisted of the q0-q2 _ kepler _ photometry and the kic stellar @xmath8 value relevant to each candidate .",
    "two runs were performed , each of them made of two markov chains of 50,000 steps each .",
    "the purpose of the first run was to estimate the level of correlated noise in each lightcurve and to provide the second run with updated error bars on the jump parameters . in the second mcmc , the good mixing and convergence of the markov chains",
    "were assessed using the gelman - rubin statistic criterion @xcite .",
    "we divided the total lightcurve in chunks of duration of @xmath024 to 48  hr and fitted for each of them the smooth photometric variations due to stellar variability or instrumental systematic effects with a time - dependent quadratic polynomial .",
    "baseline model coefficients were determined at each step of the mcmc for each lightcurve with the singular value decomposition method @xcite .",
    "the resulting coefficients were then used to correct the raw photometric lightcurves .    for each chunk of data",
    ", correlated noise was accounted for following @xcite , to ensure reliable error bars on the fitted parameters . for this purpose",
    ", we compute a scaling factor based on the standard deviation of the binned residuals for each lightcurve with different time bins .",
    "the error bars are then multiplied by this scaling factor .",
    "the rest of the important inputs for the mcmc is as follows .",
    "for each quarter , we estimated the degree of photometric dilution by using the contamination factor computed from the kic crowding matrix @xcite and was then applied to the transit photometry .",
    "we assumed a quadratic law for the limb - darkening ( ld ) and used @xmath9 and @xmath10 as jump parameters , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the quadratic coefficients . @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    "were drawn from the theoretical tables of @xcite for the corresponding kic @xmath8 and log @xmath13 values .",
    "the mcmc has the following set of jump parameters : the planet / star flux ratio , the impact parameter @xmath14 , the transit duration from first to fourth contact , the time of minimum light @xmath15 , the orbital period , the occultation depth , the two ld combinations @xmath16 and @xmath17 and the two parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 . a uniform prior distribution is assumed for all jump parameters but @xmath16 and @xmath17 , for which a normal prior distribution is used , based on theoretical tables .      the _ kepler _ giant planet candidates list is not guaranteed against false positives , although a ranking of preliminary assessment is provided on mast . yet it is the false positive rate contributed by eclipsing binary stars with larger radii than jupiter s that would contaminate our findings . furthermore , late type m dwarfs could actually produce planet - to - star area ratio indistinguishable from _ bona fide _ giant planets , because of their similar radii to jupiter - like objects ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "obtaining radial - velocity measurements at orbital quadrature for more than 100 giant planet candidate objects is unrealistic for the purpose of the present study , given the faint v magnitude of the host stars and the number of targets of higher priority in the _ kepler _ follow - up program .",
    "we therefore used our mcmc method to search for a secondary eclipse whose depth would be indicative of a stellar companion instead of a planet .",
    "no constraint on the eccentricity was imposed since binaries with orbital periods of a few days only and eccentricity @xmath20 are not uncommon ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we used the derived occultation depth @xmath21 to compute the corresponding geometric albedo @xmath22 and the brightness temperature to assess the nature of each koi .",
    "we further visually inspected the individual folded lightcurves , as discontinuities due to spacecraft roll , change of focus , pointing offsets or safe mode events could create artifacts in the raw photometry and affect the detection of shallow features in the lightcurve .",
    "we present the results of this analysis , in terms of false positive rate , in sect .  3 .      the photometric calibration of the _ kepler _ field target stars presented in the kic yields stellar radii uncertainties of 35% rms @xcite",
    "because the stellar radius uncertainty translates directly to a planet candidate size , the stellar radius uncertainty is too large for any useful constraint on the behavior of planetary radii with incident stellar flux and orbital distance .",
    "hence this motivated us to derive our own stellar radii by a different method than assuming the kic stellar radii , which yields smaller uncertainties ( of @xmath015% rms ) on the derived stellar radius ( see sect .  3 ) .",
    "the method we use employs the empirical calibration law presented in @xcite .",
    "the authors show that accurate stellar masses and radii could be deduced from the stellar effective temperature @xmath8 , surface gravity log @xmath13 and metallicity [ fe / h ] derived from spectroscopy . for this purpose",
    "they build a calibration law based on a large sample of well characterized detached binaries . a linear regression algorithm",
    "then provides the stellar mass , in function of the spectroscopic parameters .",
    "@xcite further suggested to use as input the stellar density @xmath23 instead of the stellar surface gravity log @xmath13 .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that the stellar density is well constrained by the transit lightcurve photometry @xcite , yielding better results than using the surface gravity derived from the spectroscopic analysis .",
    "the empirical calibration implemented in the mcmc is therefore a function of @xmath8 , @xmath23 and the stellar metallicity [ fe / h ] , which is poorly constrained from the kic photometry @xcite .",
    "we thus imposed a 0.3 dex uncertainty on the stellar metallicity . at each step of the mcmc , @xmath23 ( deduced from the jump parameters ) , @xmath8 and [ fe / h ] ( drawn from the normal distribution based on the kic value with the error bars quoted above )",
    "are used as input to the calibration law .",
    "the physical parameters of the system are then deduced using the resulting stellar mass .",
    "the intrinsic uncertainty of the parameters of the calibration relationship is accounted for by randomly drawing the parameters values from the normal distribution presented in @xcite at each iteration of the mcmc .",
    "the remainder of the uncertainty on the stellar radius is then mostly dominated by the error on the kic @xmath8 and on the intrisic scatter of the empirical relationship .",
    "this method makes the derivation of the stellar mass possible at each step of the mcmc without the need of performing a separate analysis based on stellar evolution models .",
    "the main result of this study is that giant planet candidate radii are independent of stellar incident flux below an incident flux of about @xmath24 erg s@xmath2@xmath3 ( figure  1 ) .",
    "although the giant planet radius trend was hinted with published giant planets alone ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also fig",
    ".  1 ) and theoretically expected ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , inclusion of these new kepler giant planet candidates radii yields a robust trend .",
    "the objects supporting this result are the _ kepler _ giant planet candidates that have no or shallow secondary eclipses consistent with their equilibrium temperature at 2@xmath25 level or less . for comparison",
    "we include transiting planets not discovered by _ kepler _ which overlap perfectly in the @xmath26 vs. incident flux plane , but mainly populate the high incident flux regime . the _ kepler _",
    "q0-q2 coverage not only enables almost a doubling of the transiting giant planet candidates but also extends the coverage out to lower incident fluxes as compared to currently known transiting planets .",
    "complicating the result is the fact that _ kepler _ planet candidates are not vetted as actual planets .",
    "we have used our mcmc analysis to assess false positives via secondary eclipse detection .",
    "indeed , 16 planet candidates show strong evidence for deep secondary eclipses suggesting a 4@xmath25 discrepancy or more with their estimated equilibrium temperature .",
    "such objects are discarded from the study .",
    "finally , 22 planet candidates yield a secondary eclipse signature whose origin can not be secured , the inferred brightness temperature being consistent with either a planetary or stellar companion .",
    "we still choose to include those candidates in figure  1 , with distinct symbols .",
    "additional data will help in tightening the nature of those objects .",
    "we notice that eclipsing binaries with grazing transits combined to non - zero orbital eccentricity would not yield any secondary eclipse and would therefore be wrongly identified as planets in our study",
    ". any such contamination should be uniform with the range of incident fluxes explored in this study and would not affect the main finding of a trend in giant planet radii .    for most of our planet candidates ,",
    "there is no information about the orbital eccentricity .",
    "instead of unrealistically assuming circular orbits , we assigned each candidate an eccentricity value drawn from the distribution presented in @xcite , as well as a random value for the argument of periastron .",
    "this approach is reasonable since no significant trend seems to exist between eccentricity and orbital period for _ kepler _ candidates @xcite .    to gauge the impact of orbital eccentricity on our results",
    ", we performed a new mcmc analysis by imposing priors on @xmath19 and @xmath18 ( see sect .",
    "2.2 ) , based on the values drawn for @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the previous step .",
    "we then computed the orbit - averaged incident flux for each candidate and found an excellent agreement ( 4% in average ) with the fluxes obtained for the circular case .",
    "the reported trend in the r@xmath29 vs. incident flux plane is therefore robust to the planetary candidates orbital eccentricity .",
    "we show our results ( assuming the eccentricity distribution described above ) on fig .  1 .    in summary , out of the 115 koi , 70 of them exhibit no or shallow secondary eclipses consistent with their equilibrium temperature . those objects are therefore considered as of planetary origin , whereas 16 are identified as stellar companions and 22 are of ambiguous classification .",
    "we list the kois and their identification in table  1 .",
    "in the course of the analysis , 7 koi got their radius revised to less than 6 @xmath30 .",
    "those koi were thus discarded from our study , as no longer part of the giant planet candidate sample .",

    "tidal energy dissipation in the giant planet interior is expected to counteract the contraction @xcite .",
