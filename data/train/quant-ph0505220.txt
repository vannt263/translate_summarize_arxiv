    "the classical action plays an important role in the feynman path integral representation for the green functions ( propagators ) of the schroedinger equation , and the only contributions that appear in the complex probability in the @xmath3 limit are associated with classical paths . also the classical action satisfying the classical hamilton - jacobi equation appears in the wave function after using the wkb decomposition .    despite all the utility of these well known approaches , because objects such as wave functions , wigner functions or other representations of density operators(e.g .",
    ", sudarshan - glauber singular p - quasidistribution@xcite and husimi - kano q - quasidistribution@xcite ) differ in an essential way from classical phase - space probability distributions , it is not easy to make a precise comparison between the two systems .",
    "this can be rectified by going to the tomographic approach where both the classical and quantum theory offer a discription in terms of tomographic probabilities.@xcite the quantum tomogram realizes a specific version of star - product quantization@xcite and allows for a comparison with the classical tomogram , both being written on the same domain .",
    "the advantage of a tomogram is connected with its property to be a standard positive probability distribution function describing the quantum state and this property was found useful to study the entanglement criterion for continuous variables,@xcite as well as to formulate a separability condition for spin degrees of freedom .",
    "@xcite    the aim of this work is to consider the quantum - classical transition within the framework of the tomographic approach .",
    "we shall mainly be concerned with examples and postpone more general considerations to a future paper . in particular , we shall consider the tomographic approach for the description of quantum states for a particle in a box , as well as the quantum tomograms of harmonic oscillator coherent states and stationary states .",
    "we study two kinds of quantum - classical transitions , the planck limit and ehrenfest limit of the quantum tomograms . in planck limit",
    "we obtain the quantum tomograms of harmonic oscillator coherent states and stationary states for @xmath3 . in the erhenfest limit",
    "we obtain the limit of the quantum tomogram of harmonic oscillator stationary states and of the states of a particle in a box for @xmath0 with fixed energy .",
    "we will show that the ehrenfest limit provides the time - average of classical motion ( both for the harmonic oscillator and the particle in a box ) .",
    "also we study the behaviour of tomograms for superposition states of the harmonic oscillator in the planck limit .",
    "namely , we show that the tomogram of the superposition of two arbitrary eigenstates ( the schroedinger cat@xcite ) , goes to a mixture of classical tomograms of these states .",
    "the interference contribution to the tomogram goes to zero in the planck limit .",
    "another type of schroedinger cat system ( consisting of even and odd coherent states@xcite ) will be considered in both the planck and ehrenfest limits .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section 2 we review known properties of symplectic tomograms for classical and quantum systems . in section 3",
    "we introduce the quantum - classical transition . in subsection 3.1",
    "the planck limits are computed for few systems . in subsection 3.2",
    "we study the ehrenfest classical limit for the stationary states of the harmonic oscillator and the infinite square well potential .",
    "concluding remarks and perspectives are given in the final section .",
    "some relevant formulae for generalized functions and their limits are considered in the appendix .",
    "following references@xcite we review the tomographic description of particle states in classical and quantum mechanics .",
    "for simplicity we restrict to one - dimensional particle systems .",
    "the standard description of classical states with fluctuations is given by a non - negative joint probability distribution function @xmath4 on the phase space of the particle with one degree of freedom .",
    "the function is normalized , i.e. @xmath5 the tomogram is the probability distribution function in a rotated and scaled reference frame on the phase - space .",
    "the classical tomogram is constructed from @xmath4 and is a function of a coordinate @xmath6 , which is related to the position @xmath7 and momentum @xmath8 of a canonical reference frame on phase - space by @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are real parameters .",
    "it can be expressed in terms of a scaling parameter @xmath12 and a rotation parameter @xmath13@xmath14 for fixed @xmath10 and @xmath11 one then gets a line on the commutative plane @xmath15 with an orientation @xmath16 from the position axis .",
    "thus the physical meaning of the variable @xmath17 is that it is the `` position '' of the particle measured in the reference frame of the phase - space whose axes are rotated by an angle @xmath16 with respect to the old reference frame , after preliminary canonical scaling of the initial position @xmath18 and momentum @xmath19 .",
    "the coordinate @xmath17 of equation ( [ metasimp ] ) together with @xmath20 provides a canonical transformation preserving the symplectic form in the phase - space .",
    "for that reason the classical tomogram is called `` symplectic '' .",
    "the tomogram of the classical statistical density @xmath4 is defined by the radon transform@xcite @xmath21 it can be written in the form @xmath22 where the average is done using the probability distribution @xmath4 in the phase space . its  inverse is @xmath23 dxd\\mu d\\nu .",
    "\\label{tom classico inv}\\ ] ]    since the classical probability distribution @xmath4 is normalized , the classical tomogram is also normalized for any values of the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath24 i.e. @xmath25 for @xmath26 , @xmath27 the tomogram provides the marginal distribution of the position @xmath28",
    "@xmath29 for @xmath30 , @xmath31 the tomogram provides the marginal probability distribution of the momentum @xmath32",
    "@xmath33    the expression ( [ tom classico ] ) is written for the case of stationary distribution function in phase space .",
    "but it is easily generalized to time - dependent functions @xmath34 @xmath35 for distribution functions associated with particle motion along a given trajectory in phase space @xmath36 @xmath37 the tomogram given by eq.([tomotime ] ) reads @xmath38 for example , classical free motion with initial position @xmath39 and initial momentum @xmath40 i.e. @xmath41 ;  @xmath42 is described by the tomogram @xmath43    below we will compare tomograms associated with motion along classical trajectories with classical limits of their corresponding quantum tomogram .",
    "when the trajectory is periodic it is possible to introduce the time - averaged classical tomogram @xmath44 the time - averaged tomogram corresponds to the time - averaged distribution function on phase - space @xmath45      given a density matrix @xmath46 one constructs the corresponding wigner function @xmath47 as : @xmath48 and the radon transform of wigner function@xmath47 is the quantum tomogram @xmath49 of @xmath50 which is a positive function@xcite of three variables , @xmath51 @xmath52 dqdu   \\label{tomrho}\\ ] ] equation ( [ tom quant ] ) can be written in a form  similar to eq.([tom ] ) , @xmath53 the difference with eq.([tom ] ) is that here the position and momentum are quantum operators @xmath54 and @xmath55 , i.e. we use non - commutative geometry of phase - space plane , taking into account uncertainty relations .",
    "the averaging in eq.([tom \" ] ) is done using density operators @xmath56 , i.e. @xmath57 the inverse formula of eq.([tom quant ] ) is readily written as : @xmath58 dxd\\mu d\\nu .\\ ] ] the density matrix @xmath59 can be obtained from the wigner function as @xmath60 dp.\\ ] ] in terms of tomogram we get : @xmath61 dxd\\mu\\ ] ] for pure states @xmath62 and @xmath49 can be computed from eq.([tomrho ] ) : @xmath63 @xmath64 thus , apart from the pre - factor @xmath65 , the tomogram @xmath49 of the wave function @xmath66 is the square modulus of the tomogram amplitude @xmath67@xmath68 when @xmath27 and @xmath69 one can instead use @xmath70 where the fourier transform of the wave function has been introduced @xmath71 if both @xmath72 , we get @xmath73 , after using @xmath74 .    tomograms of quantum states and classical statistical density are positive functions on the same space @xmath75 and therefore can be compared .",

    "the real variable @xmath17 gives the possible results of a measure of@xmath84 and runs over the spectrum of @xmath82 . in this way",
    "a description of quantum tomograms is recovered in complete analogy with the classical case .",
    "so the tomogram is also `` symplectic '' in the quantum case .    in classical mechanics , the transition from the distribution function of two canonically conjugate variables ( position @xmath7 and momentum @xmath8 ) to the distribution function of one variable ( position @xmath17 ) does not play a crucial role due to absence of quantum mechanical constraints like the uncertainty relations of heisenberg@xcite and robertson - schroedinger@xcite . on the contrary",
    ", the use of tomograms in quantum mechanics provides the possibility of describing a quantum state with a probability distribution which does not violate the uncertainty relations . comparing the eqs.([tom ] ) and ( [ tom \" ] ) we see that the classical limit will be found starting from a non - commutative plane @xmath85 and going to a commutative one @xmath86 this means that in the limit process we take into full account the behaviour of the quantum uncertainty relations .",
    "the classical limit of quantum states can be obtained using different procedures .",
    "one procedure is to take the limit @xmath0 of certain quantum mechanical expressions .",
    "the wave function defined on the configuration space is not suitable for this purpose , since there is no physical interpretation of the resulting limit .",
    "it is more useful to associate an `` observable '' with any state vector , namely the associated rank - one projector . following the weyl - wigner approach observables",
    "can be mapped to functions on phase - space and finally to tomograms via radon transform .",
    "the classical limit @xmath0 then can be done on tomograms in two different ways .    1 .   at a kinematic level ( planck limit ) . here",
    "no reference is made to any specific dynamics .",
    "2 .   at a dynamical level ( ehrenfest limit ) . here",
    "the limit @xmath3 on tomograms is performed keeping constant the mean value of a given observable ( usually the hamiltonian ) .",
    "we can anticipate some general features of the planck limit for the tomogram of a quantum state .",
    "the quantum fluctuations of position and momentum , depending on planck s constant , are washed out when @xmath0 and in general a dirac @xmath87 results , corresponding to the tomogram of the classical probability distribution @xmath88 the fact that that dirac delta function is centered at the origin has no particular physical significance , as it is only due to the arbitrary choice of the origin of the affine phase space .",
    "the planck limit can be predicted from a scaling argument for a large class of wave functions .",
    "assume the dependence on @xmath89 in the wave function @xmath90 is ( @xmath91 a real number ) @xmath92 this assures that @xmath93 independent of the value of @xmath94__. _ _ computing the tomogram in this case we get @xmath95    when @xmath96 it gives @xmath97 since in general @xmath98 the dirac delta theorem of the appendix , with @xmath99 applies and yields the planck limit of the tomogram as @xmath100 this is the case of the harmonic oscillator eigenstates and their superpositions .",
    "when @xmath101 for the wave function in position space , its fourier transform @xmath102 of eq.([fourier ] ) scales with @xmath96 and using eq.([tom quant pure state 2 ] ) we recover the same planck limit of eq.([planck ] ) . in general this",

    "when the energy vanishes , the result is a rest state @xmath162 with the particle sitting at the minimum of the potential .",
    "the same results were shown to apply in the case of both the planck and the ehrenfest limits of the quantum tomogram for a particle in a box .    we have also found that , for the schroedinger cat states , the interference term of a superposition of two orthogonal states vanishes in the planck limit as @xmath258 . in the ehrenfest limit ,",
    "even and odd coherent states yield the expected mixture of two classical delta distribution .    for composite systems , we believe that tomographic description of quantum and classical states can be a suitable tool to study the classical limit of entangled states both in the planck and in ehrenfest limit .",
    "this aspect will be considered in a forthcoming paper .",
    "finally we observe that the diverging inverse velocity factor in the ehrenfest limit of the harmonic oscillator results from the presence of turning points of the harmonic oscillator motion along the @xmath259axis .",
    "these divergences should disappear when describing the motion with a complex variable instead of a real one . to do that , the holomorphic ( i.e. bargmann - fock ) representation is suitable .",
    "however , this requires a preliminary discussion for dealing with tomograms associated with non - hermitian operators , which will appear elsewhere .",
    "many results of the present paper follow from a theorem , valid under quite general assumptions , that here we recall :          * remark * we can evaluate the planck limit of the product of tomogram amplitudes @xmath267when the state vectors @xmath268and @xmath269 have scaling exponent @xmath270 in general , for any @xmath271it is @xmath272 in the case@xmath273 scaling the integration variables yields @xmath274 so , as a consequence of the previous theorem ( with@xmath275 it results @xmath276 for the tomogram amplitudes @xmath277 of the eigenstates @xmath278 of a quantum harmonic oscillator , it results @xmath279 where @xmath280 is the kronecker delta .",
