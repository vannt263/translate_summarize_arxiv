    "quantum systems described by non - hermitian hamiltonians with real spectra have drawn great interest in recent years @xcite .",
    "these systems are invariant under parity and time reversal symmetry ( @xmath0-symmetry ) and their behavior is quite different from hermitian ones .",
    "important issues , such as definition of an inner product , unitarity , as well as the definition of observables for this new `` quantum mechanics '' have been intensively studied @xcite . as a result , new avenues have been opened for the observation of exotic phenomena associated with non - hermiticity .",
    "in particular , recent developments in optics have allowed the construction of `` complex crystals '' with unique properties such as violation of friedel s law @xcite .",
    "these systems are realized in waveguide arrays that include gain and loss regions .",
    "furthermore , a restricted class of complex crystals may be built so that they posses the aforementioned @xmath0-symmetry . along these lines , very recent experiments realized for two coupled waveguides have revealed a new behavior for light propagation in @xmath0-symmetric optical systems @xcite .",
    "additionally , driven periodic complex potentials have proven to be a fertile ground for the study of novel phenomena in wave mechanics such as non - conventional bloch oscillations @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider the scenario in which a dc force is applied to a @xmath0-symmetric complex lattice . as in conventional quantum mechanics ,",
    "the application of an external force may lead to interband transitions and interference phenomena .",
    "however , since in this case the time evolution does not obey the unitarity condition , such transitions are fundamentally different .",
    "motivated by this idea , in the present work we provide a detailed analysis of the landau - zener transitions for a light beam propagating in a complex potential .    for this purpose simulations of the interband transitions",
    "are performed revealing that the behavior of the relative occupation probabilities for the bands can be accurately managed upon tuning the amplitude of the non - hermitian component of the lattice . in particular ,",
    "the power can be increased or decreased during the transition process depending on the sign of the non - hermitian part of the potential .",
    "complementary to our numerical results , we develop an analytical framework that describes the transitions near the level crossings within a two - mode aproximation .",
    "notably , the analytical results not only provide deep insight into the dynamics of the system , but also accurately reproduce the main features observed in our numerical simulations . as a special case",
    ", we interpret the non - conventional bloch oscillations studied at criticality in @xcite as a sequence of landau - zener transitions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we describe the model for light propagation in periodic structures with complex refractive index within the paraxial regime .",
    "next , in section iii we consider a two - mode approximation for the description of the dynamics in the complex lattice and provide analytical expressions for its non - adiabatic behavior . in section iv",
    ", we present a detailed explanation of our numerical results for the system considered in section ii and compare them with the theoretical predictions obtained within the two - mode approximation . in section v we summarize our results and discuss prospects for future developments .",
    "within the paraxial approximation the propagation of a monochromatic light beam with wavelength @xmath1 through the lattice can be described by the schrdinger type equation @xcite    @xmath2    where @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the refractive index of the substrate .",
    "the potential is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the periodic refractive index profile and @xmath7 is the periodicity of the lattice .",
    "the time - like coordinate @xmath8 is the propagation distance along the waveguides and @xmath9 is the corresponding transverse axis . in the last term of ( [ eq : shrod ] )",
    ", @xmath10 represents the gradient of the refraction index that mimics the effect of an external dc force .    for a complex potential ,",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath11 renders @xmath12 into a non - hermitian hamiltonian . in the following",
    "we shall consider @xmath13 , which satisfies @xmath14 and thus @xmath15 is @xmath0-symmetric @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath15 has real values for @xmath16 ; otherwise the bands merge giving place to pairs of complex conjugate values @xcite . henceforth , we consider @xmath17 , unless otherwise specified .",
    "the eigenfunctions of @xmath15 are the floquet - bloch band mode functions @xmath18 with bloch - momentum @xmath19 which fulfill the secular equation @xmath20 , where @xmath21 are the eigenenergies corresponding to the @xmath22-th floquet - bloch band . while as in real crystals @xmath23 , the wavefunctions under the parity transformation @xmath24 and @xmath25 obey the general relation @xmath26 , where @xmath27 are eigenfunctions of @xmath28 .",
    "moreover , the orthogonality condition becomes @xmath29 with @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "it is important to notice that for the @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonian @xmath15 the power of the propagating light beam remains constant provided @xmath17 .",
    "if in addition we consider the presence of an external force as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : shrod ] ) , the @xmath31-symmetry is broken and the power is not longer a conserved quantity . thus , under the action of the force , transitions to other bands may occur which do not conserve the power .",
    "recently , the gaussian wavepacket dynamics of this system has been analyzed in the presence of a small external force @xcite . in the following sections we generalize the analysis for arbitrary values of @xmath10 .    to gain understanding of the interband transition processes ,",
    "we consider as input excitation a plane wave with normal incidence .",
    "hence , the wavefunction can be written as a superposition of the floquet - bloch eigenfunctions , i.e. @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "expanding @xmath35 in a fourier basis , we can write @xmath36 here , @xmath37 with @xmath38 are the coefficients of the fourier expansion for @xmath39 . substituting this into eqs .",
    "( [ eq : shrod]-[eq : poten ] ) we get the dimensionless equation for the dynamics of @xmath40 , @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "it is convenient to write the evolution equation in the usual quantum mechanics notation @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the vector with components @xmath40 and @xmath49 this hamiltonian matrix is real but non - symmetric and has a real spectrum for values @xmath50 . from this expression",
    "it is also clear that changing the sign of the amplitude of the imaginary part of the potential @xmath51 is equivalent to a transposition of @xmath52 .",
    "note that the problem becomes analogous to the dynamics of a particle moving on a discrete chain with non - symmetric hopping amplitudes ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) and on - site energies given by @xmath55 .",
    "clearly , for positive values of @xmath51 , the system tends to evolve towards modes with higher energies and viceversa .",
    "this is a manifestation of the fact that there is energy gain ( loss ) for positive ( negative ) values @xmath56 in the optical system ( [ eq : shrod ] ) .    a numerical diagonalization of ( [ eq : ham ] ) results in the energy spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "the diagram of energy vs. bloch - momentum reveals that increasing @xmath51 causes an approaching of the bands at the avoided crossings leading to degeneracies at @xmath57 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     as the system is driven through bloch - momentum space , a series of avoided crossings in the spectrum may lead to multiple transitions . in this regard , we carried out simulations going from @xmath58 to @xmath59 with @xmath60 , such that the window in the @xmath19 axis includes two avoided crossings .",
    "[ fig : norma ] shows the power @xmath61 as a function of the propagation distance @xmath62 .",
    "the fundamental feature in both panels is the emergence of steps at the bragg scattering points as the power evolves . while for @xmath63 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : norma]a ) the power exhibits growing steps after every avoided crossing , in the case of @xmath64 the power decreases in a sequence of small steps ( fig .",
    "[ fig : norma]b ) . to understand these two different scenarios",
    "we follow the evolution of the beam power through the band struture with the help of expression ( [ eq : norma ] ) .",
    "let us first analyze the critical situation @xmath57 where the two lowest bands cross : for a positive force our analytical results predict a behavior similar to bloch oscillations , reflected in the large value of the intensity of the ground state after @xmath22 consecutive crossings ( @xmath65 ) and with the remaining power ( @xmath66 ) transferred to higher energy bands @xcite .",
    "this process is schematically depicted in fig . [",
    "fig : spectrum]b by arrows pointing to the right .",
    "in contrast , for a negative force , the ground state has a null intensity after @xmath22 succesive crossings which clearly indicates the absence of bloch oscillations . here",
    ", a full transition to the excited state takes place after undergoing the first crossing and since there is zero coupling between higher bands , the state follows a parabolic trajectory as schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum]b with arrows pointing to the left .    for nonzero gap ,",
    "transitions become determined by the tradeoff between the applied force and the gap , resulting in a rich picture of bloch - oscillation - like behavior combined with interband transitions whose average power can be estimated using expression ( [ eq : norma ] ) ( see horizontal dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : norma ] ) .",
    "notice that for @xmath63 the height of the steps is decreased when the amplitude of the imaginary component of the potential is reduced ( fig .",
    "[ fig : norma]a ) , as expected due to the associated absorption process .",
    "conversely , for @xmath64 there is an attenuation of the power at each transition as observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : norma]b . once again the applicability of the theoretical equations derived within the two - mode formalism is demonstrated by the excellent agreement with numerical simulations .",
    "we would also like to point out that all of the results mentioned above for the two - mode approximation correspond to asymptotic values far from the avoided level crossing .",
    "nevertheless , close to the transition region , the exact two - mode calculation exhibits an oscillating behavior similar to the one present in the simulations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : norma ] . clearly , these oscillations arise as a result of the interaction between the bands and are damped out as the coupling becomes negligible when the system evolves away from the ( avoided ) level crossing .",
    "in summary we have investigated the landau - zener transitions for a @xmath31-symmetric complex lattice that can be realized in optical waveguide arrays .",
    "firstly , the analysis was performed using an exact calculation for the two - mode approximation and later extended to the complete multi - mode system driven through a series of avoided crossings .",
    "overall , we found that the two - mode framework provides a simple and transparent understanding of the main features of the dynamics in the complex crystal .",
    "the analytical expressions presented above not only reflect the non - reciprocity of the lattice , but also accurately predict the simulation results including the more general scenario with multiple crossings .",
    "also , it is found that the power is very susceptible to the system speed as it moves accross the bragg scattering points , where the passage time determines the amount of energy absorbed / emitted by the light beam .",
    "this mechanism can be used as a way to control the intensity of the light beam in a complex waveguide array .    in a different context",
    ", complex optical lattices for cold atoms have been built @xcite . in this",
    "regard , investigation of transitions for matter waves between bands realized for real optical lattices @xcite could in principle be extended to @xmath0-symmetric systems .",
    "furthermore , the results exposed on this work could eventually serve as a benchmark for future developments in the several areas that involve landau - zener processes and interferometry for non - symmetric hamiltonians .      c. bender , rep",
