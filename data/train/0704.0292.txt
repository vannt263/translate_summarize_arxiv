    "two broad classes of jet definition are generally advocated @xcite for hadron colliders .",
    "one option is to use sequential recombination jet algorithms , such as the @xmath4 @xcite and cambridge / aachen algorithms @xcite , which introduce a distance measure between particles , and repeatedly recombine the closest pair of particles until some stopping criterion is reached .",
    "while experimentally these are starting to be investigated @xcite , the bulk of measurements are currently carried out with the other class of jet definition , cone jet algorithms ( see _ e.g. _",
    "in general there are indications  @xcite that it may be advantageous to use both sequential recombination and cone jet algorithms because of complementary sensitivities to different classes of non - perturbative corrections .",
    "cone jet algorithms are inspired by the idea @xcite of defining a jet as an angular cone around some direction of dominant energy flow .",
    "to find these directions of dominant energy flow , cone algorithms usually take some ( or all ) of the event particles as ` seeds ' , _ i.e. _  trial cone directions .",
    "then for each seed they establish the list of particles in the trial cone , evaluate the sum of their 4-momenta , and use the resulting 4-momentum as a new trial direction for the cone .",
    "this procedure is iterated until the cone direction no longer changes , _",
    "i.e. _  until one has a `` stable cone '' .",
    "stable cones have the property that the cone axis @xmath5 ( a four - vector ) coincides with the ( four - vector ) axis defined by the total momentum of the particles contained in the cone , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is some measure of angular distance between the four - momentum @xmath8 and the cone axis @xmath5 , and @xmath9 is the given opening ( half)-angle of the cone , also referred to as the cone radius . typically one defines @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are respectively the rapidity and azimuth of @xmath8 and @xmath5 .",
    "two types of problem arise when using seeds as starting points of an iterative search for stable cones . on one hand ,",
    "if one only uses particles above some momentum threshold as seeds , then the procedure is collinear unsafe . alternatively",
    "if any particle can act as a seed then one needs to be sure that the addition of an infinitely soft particle can not lead to a new ( hard ) stable cone being found , otherwise the procedure is infrared ( ir ) unsafe .",
    "the second of these problems came to fore in the 1990 s @xcite , when it was realised that there can be stable cones that have two hard particles on opposing edges of the cone and no particles in the middle , _ e.g. _  for configurations such as @xmath13 in traditional iterative cone algorithms , @xmath14 and @xmath15 each act as seeds and two stable cones are found , one centred on @xmath14 , the other centred on @xmath15 .",
    "the third stable cone , centred between @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( and containing them both ) is not found .",
    "if , however , a soft particle is added between the two hard particles , it too acts as a seed and the third stable cone is then found .",
    "the set of stable cones ( and final jets ) is thus different with and without the soft particle and there is a resulting non - cancellation of divergent real soft production and corresponding virtual contributions , _",
    "i.e. _  the algorithm is infrared unsafe .",
    "infrared unsafety is a serious issue , not just because it makes it impossible to carry out meaningful ( finite ) perturbative calculations , but also because it breaks the whole relation between the ( born or low - order ) partonic structure of the event and the jets that one observes , and it is precisely this relation that a jet algorithm is supposed to codify : it makes no sense for the structure of multi - hundred gev jets to change radically just because hadronisation , the underlying event or pileup threw a 1 gev particle in between them .",
    "a workaround for the above ir unsafety problem was proposed in @xcite : after finding the stable cones that come from the true seed particles , add artificial `` midpoint '' seeds between pairs of stable cones and search for new stable cones that arise from the midpoint seeds . for configurations with two hard particles ,",
    "the midpoint fix resolved the ir unsafety issue .",
    "it was thus adopted as a recommendation @xcite for run  ii of the tevatron and is now coming into use experimentally  @xcite .",
    "recently , it was observed @xcite that in certain triangular three - point configurations there are stable cones that are not identified even by the midpoint procedure . while these can be identified by extended midpoint procedures ( _ e.g. _  midpoints between triplets of particles ) @xcite , in this article ( section  [ sec : linear - ir - unsafety ] ) we show that there exist yet other 3-particle configurations for which even this fix does not find all stable cones .",
    "given this history of infrared safety problems being fixed and new ones being found , it seems to us that iterative cone algorithms should be abandoned .",
    "instead we believe that cone jet algorithms should solve the mathematical problem of demonstrably finding all stable cones , _",
    "i.e. _  all solutions to eq .",
    "( [ eq : stable ] ) .",
    "this kind of jet algorithm is referred to as an exact seedless cone jet algorithm @xcite and has been advocated before in  @xcite . with an exact seedless algorithm , the addition of one or more soft particles can not lead to new hard stable cones being found , because all hard stable cones have already been ( provably ) found .",
    "therefore the algorithm is infrared safe at all orders .",
    "two proposals exist for approximate implementations of the seedless jet algorithm @xcite .",
    "they both rely on the event being represented in terms of calorimeter towers , which is far from ideal when considering parton or hadron - level events .",
    "@xcite also proposed a procedure for an exact seedless jet algorithm , intended for fixed - order calculations , and implemented for example in the mcfm and nlojet fixed order ( nlo ) codes  @xcite . ]",
    "this method takes a time @xmath16 to find jets among @xmath1 particles . while perfectly adequate for fixed order calculations ( @xmath17 ) , a recommendation to extend the use of such seedless cone implementations more generally would have little chance of being adopted experimentally : the time to find jets in a single ( quiet ! ) event containing @xmath18 particles would approach @xmath19 years .",
    "given the crucial importance of infrared safety in allowing one to compare theoretical predictions and experimental measurements , and the need for the same algorithm to be used in both , there is a strong motivation for finding a more efficient way of implementing the seedless cone algorithm .",
    "section  [ sec : exact - cone ] will show how this can be done , first in the context of a simple one - dimensional example ( sec .",
    "[ sec:1d ] ) , then generalising it to two dimensions ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 , sec .",
    "[ sec:2d ] ) with an approach that can be made to run in polynomial ( @xmath2 ) time . as in recent work on speeding up the @xmath4 jet - algorithm @xcite ,",
    "the key insights will be obtained by considering the geometrical aspects of the problem .",
    "section  [ sec : split  merge ] will discuss aspects of the split ",
    "merge procedure .    in section  [ sec : tests ] we will study a range of physics and practical properties of the seedless algorithm .",
    "given that the split ",
    "merge stage is complex and so yet another potential source of infrared unsafety , we will use monte carlo techniques to provide independent evidence for the safety of the algorithm , supplementing a proof given in appendix  [ sec : appendix ] .",
    "we will examine the speed of our coding of the algorithm and see that it is as fast as publicly available midpoint codes .",
    "we will also study the question of the relation between the low - order perturbative characteristics of the algorithm , and its all - order behaviour , notably as concerns the ` @xmath22 ' issue  @xcite .",
    "finally we highlight physics contexts where we see similarities and differences between our seedless algorithm and the midpoint algorithm . for inclusive quantities , such as the inclusive jet spectrum , perturbative differences are of the order of a few percent , increasing to 10% at hadron level owing to reduced sensitivity to the underlying event in the seedless algorithm . for exclusive quantities",

    "a sensible default is @xmath27 since , as formulated , the procedure will in any case stop once further passes find no further stable cones . the @xmath25 threshold for the split ",
    "merge step is also an addition relative to the run  ii procedure , inspired by @xcite .",
    "it is discussed in section [ sec : split  merge ] together with the rest of the split  merge procedure and may be set to zero to recover the original run  ii type behaviour , a sensible default .",
    "the main development of this paper is the specification of how to efficiently carry out step [ alg : fullcone : allstable ] of algorithm  [ alg : fullcone ] . in section  [ sec : linear - ir - unsafety ] we will show that the midpoint approximation for finding stable cones fails to find them all , leading to infrared unsafety problems . section  [ sec : exact - cone ] will provide a practical solution .",
    "code corresponding to this algorithm is available publicly under the name of ` seedless infrared safe cone ' ( siscone ) .",
    "until now , the exact exhaustive identification of all stable cones was considered to be too computationally complex to be feasible for realistic particle multiplicities . instead ,",
    "the tevatron experiments streamline the search for stable cones with the so - called midpoint algorithm  @xcite . given a seed , the latter calculates the total momentum of the particles contained within a cone centred on the seed , uses the direction of this momentum as a new seed and iterates until the resulting cone is stable .",
    "the initial set of seeds is that of all particles whose transverse momentum is above a seed threshold @xmath28 ( one may take @xmath29 to obtain a collinear - safe algorithm ) .",
    "then , one adds a new set of seeds given by all midpoints between pairs of stable cones separated by less than @xmath30 and repeats the iterations from these midpoint seeds .",
    "the problem with the midpoint cone algorithm can be seen from the configurations of table  [ tab : config ] , represented also in fig .",
    "[ fig : example - unsafe ] .",
    ".particles 13 represent a hard configuration .",
    "the jets from this hard configuration are modified in the midpoint cone algorithm when one adds the soft particle @xmath31 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the hard events are produced as follows : we choose a linearly distributed random number of momenta ( between 2 and 10 ) and for each one generate a random @xmath32 ( linearly distributed , @xmath33 , with @xmath34 ) , a random rapidity ( linearly distributed in @xmath35 ) and a random @xmath21 . for each hard event we also choose random parameters for the jet algorithm , so as to cover the jet - algorithm parameter space ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 , linearly distributed , the upper limit on @xmath9 being motivated by the requirement that @xmath38 ; the @xmath25 on protojets is set to 0 and the number of passes is set to @xmath39 ) . for each add - on soft event we generate between @xmath39 and @xmath40 soft momenta , distributed as the hard ones , but with the soft scale @xmath41 replacing @xmath42 .",
    "we note that the hard events generated as above do not conserve momentum  they are analogous to events with a missing energy component or with identified photons or leptons that are not given as inputs to the jet clustering . for the safety studies on the full siscone algorithm",
    ", we therefore also generate a set of hard events which do have momentum conservation , analogous to purely hadronic events .",
    "to validate our approach to testing ir safety , we apply it to a range of cone jet algorithms , listed in table  [ tab : cone_summary ] , including the many variants that are ir unsafe . in pxcone",
    "the cut on protojets is set to @xmath43 and in the searchcone algorithm the search cone radius is set to @xmath44 .    the fraction of hard events failing the safety test is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ir_failures ] for each of the jet algorithms .",
    "all jet algorithms that are known to be ir unsafe do indeed fail the tests .",
    "one should be aware that the absolute failure rates depend to some extent on the way we generated the hard events , and so are to be interpreted with caution .",
    "having said that , our hard events have a complexity similar to the born - level ( lowest - order parton - level ) of events that will be studied at lhc , for example in the various decay channels of @xmath45 production , and so both the order of magnitudes of the failure rates and their relative sizes should be meaningful .    .",
    "seeded algorithms have been used with a zero seed threshold .",
    "the events used do not conserve momentum ( _ i.e. _  have a missing energy component ) , except for the seedless sm-@xmath32 case ( where all events conserve momentum , to highlight the issue that arises in that case ) and for siscone ( where we use a mix of momentum conserving and non - conserving events so as to fully test the algorithm ) .",
    "further details are given in the text , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    algorithms that fail on ` 2h+1s ' events have larger failure rates than those that fail on ` 3h+1s ' events , as would be expected  they are ` more ' infrared unsafe .",
    "one notes the significant failure rates for the midpoint algorithms , @xmath46 , and the fact that adding 3-way midpoints ( _ i.e. _  between triplets of stable cones ) has almost no effect on the failure rate , indicating that triangular configurations identified as ir unsafe in @xcite are much less important than others such as that discussed in section  [ sec : linear - ir - unsafety ] .",
    "pxcone s smaller failure rate seems to be due not to its multi - way midpoints , but rather to its specific split ",
    "merge procedure which leads to fewer final jets ( so that one is less sensitive to missing stable cones )",
    ".    seedless algorithms with problematic split ",
    "merge procedures lead to small failure rates ( restricting one s attention to small values of @xmath9 , these values are further reduced ) .",
    "one might be tempted to argue that such small rates of ir safety failure are unlikely to have a physical impact and can therefore be ignored .",
    "however there is always a risk of some specific study being unusually sensitive to these configurations , and in any case our aim here is to provide an algorithm whose ir safety is exact , not just approximate .    finally , with a ` good ' split  merge procedure , that given as algorithm  [ alg : splitmerge ] , none of the over @xmath47 hard events tested ( a mix both with and without momentum conservation ) failed the ir safety test .",
    "for completeness , we have carried out limited tests also for @xmath48 and with a @xmath25 on protojets of @xmath49 , and have additionally performed tests with a larger range of rapidities ( @xmath50 ) , collinearly - split momenta , cocircular configurations , three scales instead of two scales and again found no failures .",
    "these tests together with the proof given in appendix  [ sec : appendix ] give us a good degree of confidence that the algorithm truly is infrared safe , hence justifying its name .      as can be gathered from the discussion in  @xcite",
    ", reasonable speed is an essential requirement if a new variant of cone jet algorithm is to be adopted . to determine the speed of various cone jet algorithms",
    ", we use the same set of events taken for testing the fastjet formulation of the @xmath4 jet algorithm in @xcite  these consist of a single pythia @xcite dijet event ( with @xmath51 ) to which we add varying numbers of simulated minimum bias events so as to vary the multiplicity @xmath1 .",

    "our seedless code , siscone , is comparable in speed to the fastest of the seeded codes , the cdf midpoint code with a seed threshold @xmath54 , and is considerably faster than the codes without a seed threshold ( not to mention existing exact seedless codes which take @xmath56s to find jets among @xmath57 particles and scale as @xmath58 ) .",
    "its run time also increases more slowly with @xmath1 than that of the seeded codes , roughly in agreement with the expectation of siscone going as @xmath59 ( with a large coefficient ) while the others go as @xmath60 .",
    "the midpoint code with @xmath54 has a more complex @xmath1-dependence presumably because we have run the timing on a single set of momenta , and the proportionality between the number of seeds and @xmath1 fluctuates and depends on the event structure .    for comparison purposes we have also included the timings for the fastjet ( v2 ) @xmath4 implementation , which for these values of @xmath1 uses a strategy that involves a combination of @xmath61 and @xmath62 dependencies .",
    "timings for the fastjet implementation of the aachen / cambridge algorithm are similar to those for the @xmath4 algorithm .",
    "suppose we have two partons separated by @xmath64 and with transverse momenta @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "both partons end up in the same jet if the cone containing both is stable , _",

    "equivalently one can write the probability for two partons to be clustered into a single jet as @xmath69 the limit on @xmath70 ranges from @xmath39 for @xmath71 to @xmath72 for @xmath73 .",
    "this @xmath74-dependent limit is the main low - order perturbative difference between the cone algorithm and inclusive versions of sequential recombination ones like the @xmath4 or cambridge / aachen algorithms , since the latter merge two partons into a single jet for @xmath75 , independently of their energies .",
    "a statement regularly made about cone algorithms ( see for example @xcite ) is that parton showering and hadronisation reduce the stability of the cone containing the ` original ' two partons , leading to a modified ` practical ' condition for two partons to end up in a single jet , @xmath76 or equivalently , @xmath77 with @xmath78  @xcite . was originally introduced  @xcite in the context of nlo calculations of hadron - collider jet - spectra , but with a different meaning  there it was intended as a free parameter to model the lack of knowledge about the details of the definition of the cone jet algorithm used experimentally .",

    "see @xcite ) , we can easily calculate the @xmath119 difference between midpoint and siscone , using just tree - level @xmath120 diagrams , since the difference between the algorithms is zero at orders @xmath121 and @xmath122 , _",
    "i.e. _  we can neglect two - loop @xmath123 diagrams and one - loop @xmath124 diagrams .",
    "the significance of the difference can be understood by comparing to the leading order spectrum , which is identical for the two algorithms .",
    "figure [ fig : nlojet_incl ] shows the resulting spectra : the upper plot gives the leading order inclusive spectrum together with the difference between siscone and midpoint(0 ) at @xmath119 .",
    "the lower plot shows the relative difference .",
    "one sees that the use of the ir - safe seedless cone algorithm introduces modest corrections , of order 1 - 2% , in the inclusive jet spectrum .",
    "this order of magnitude is roughly what one would expect , since the differences only appear at relative order @xmath121 . as we will see below",
    ", larger differences will appear when one examines more exclusive quantities .",
    "in addition , we have used herwig and pythia to investigate the differences between midpoint(1 ) and siscone with parton showering .",
    "both generators give similar results , and we show the results just of pythia , fig .",
    "[ fig : incl-3lev]a .",
    "the difference at parton level is very similar to what was observed at fixed order . at hadron level without underlying event ( ue ) corrections , the difference remains at the level of @xmath125 ( though it changes sign ) ; once one includes the underlying event contributions , the difference increases noticeably at lower @xmath32  this is because the midpoint(1 ) algorithm receives somewhat larger ue corrections than siscone . since the underlying event is one of the things that is likely to change from tevatron to lhc , in figure [ fig : incl-3lev]b we show similar curves for lhc kinematics . at parton level and at hadron level without the underlying event , the results are essentially the same as for the tevatron . with the underlying event included , the impact of the missing stable cones in the midpoint algorithm reaches of the order of 10 to 15% , and thus starts to become quite a significant effect . with herwig , we find that the impact is little smaller because its underlying event is smaller than pythia s at the lhc .      .",
    "]    . ]        as well as the inclusive jet @xmath126 spectrum , we can also study more exclusive quantities .",
    "one example is the jet - mass spectrum in multi - jet events .",
    "jet - masses are potentially of interest for qcd studies , particle mass measurements @xcite and new physics searches , where they could be used to identify highly boosted w / z / h bosons or top quarks produced in the decays of new heavy particles  @xcite .    the simplest multi - jet events in which to study jet masses are 3-jet events . there",
    ", the masses of all the jets vanish at the 3-particle level .",
    "the first order at which the jet masses become non - zero is @xmath117 and this is also the order at which differences appear between the midpoint and seedless cone algorithms .",
    "therefore , as in section  [ sec : inclspect ] , we generate @xmath120 tree - level events , but now keep only those with exactly 3 jets with @xmath127 gev in the final state .",
    "we further impose that the hardest jet should have a @xmath126 of at least 120 gev and the second hardest jet a @xmath126 of at least 60 gev . with these cuts",
    "we can compute the jet - mass spectrum for each of the three jets and for the three different algorithms .    in the upper plot of figure [ fig : nlojet_mass2 ]",
    ", we show the relative difference `` ( midpoint(0 ) - siscone)/siscone '' for the mass spectrum of the second hardest jet . in the lower plot",
    "we show the same quantity for events in which we have placed an additional requirement that the @xmath128 distance between the second and third jets be less than @xmath30 ( such distance cuts are often used when trying to reconstruct chains of particle decays ) .",
    "the midpoint algorithm s omission of certain stable cones leads to an overestimate of the mass spectrum by up to @xmath129 without a distance cut ( much smaller differences are observed for the first and third jet ) and of over @xmath130 with a distance cut .",
    "the problem is enhanced by the presence of the distance cut because many more of the selected events then have three particles in a common neighbourhood , and this is precisely the situation in which the midpoint algorithm misses stable cones ( _ cf .",
    "_  section  [ sec : linear - ir - unsafety ] ) .",
    "we emphasise also that the nlo calculation of these mass spectra would be impossible with a midpoint algorithm , because the @xmath131 tree - level differences would be converted into an infrared divergent nlo contribution .",
    "a general comment is that the problems seen here for the midpoint algorithm without a distance cut are of the same general order of magnitude as the 16% failure rate in the ir safety tests of section  [ sec : ir - safety ] , suggesting that the absolute failure rates given there are a good indicator of the degree of seriousness of issues that can arise in generic studies with the infrared unsafe algorithms .",
    "in addition to this fixed - order parton - level analysis , we have studied the jet masses in 3-jet events at hadron level ( _ i.e. _  after parton showering and hadronisation ) using events generated with pythia . at hadron",
    "level many more seeds are present , due to the large particle multiplicity .",
    "one might therefore expect the midpoint algorithm to become a good approximation to the seedless one .    for the mass of the second hardest jet , _",
    "i.e. _  the quantity we studied at fixed order in figure  [ fig : nlojet_mass2 ] , we find that the midpoint and seedless algorithms do give rather similar results at hadron level .",
    "in other words differences that we see in a leading order calculation are not propagated through to the full hadron level result .",
    "this is a serious practical issue for the midpoint algorithm , because a jet algorithm s principal role is to provide a good mapping between low - order parton level and hadron level .    nevertheless , despite the many seeds that are present at hadron level , we find that there are still some observables for which the midpoint algorithm s lack of stable cones does have a large impact even at hadron level .",
    "this is the case that the mass distribution of the third hardest jet , shown in figure  [ fig : pythia_mass ] ( obtained without a distance cut ) on both linear and logarithmic scales so as to help visualise the various regions of the distribution .",
    "moderate differences are present in the peak region , but in the tail of the distribution they become large , up to 50% .",
    "they are greater for midpoint(1 ) than for midpoint(0 ) , because the seed threshold causes fewer stable cones to be found with the midpoint(1 ) algorithm .",
    "these results have been checked using the herwig monte - carlo . we have observed similar differences at parton - shower level , at the hadron level and at the hadron level including underlying event , both in the peak of the distribution and in the tail .",
    "we note that hadronisation corrections are substantial in the tail of the distribution , both for the midpoint and siscone algorithms .",
    "the above results confirm what one might naturally have expected : while very inclusive quantities may not be overly sensitive to the deficiencies of one s jet algorithm , as one extends one s investigations to more exclusive quantities , those deficiencies begin to have a much larger impact .",
    "given the widespread use of cone jet algorithms at the tevatron and their foreseen continued use at lhc , it is crucial that they be defined in an infrared safe way .",
    "this is necessary in general so as to ensure that low - order parton - level considerations about cone jet - finding hold also for the fully showered , hadronised jets that are observed in practice .",
    "it is also a prerequisite if measurements are to be meaningfully compared to fixed order ( lo , nlo , nnlo ) predictions .",
    "the midpoint iterative cone algorithm currently in use is infrared unsafe , as can be seen by examining the sets of stable cones that are found for simple three - parton configurations .",
    "this may seem surprising given that the midpoint algorithm was specifically designed to avoid an earlier infrared safety problem  however the midpoint infrared problem appears at one order higher in the coupling , and this is presumably why it was not identified in the original analyses .",
    "the tests shown in section  [ sec : ir - safety ] suggest that the midpoint - cone infrared safety problems , while smaller than without the midpoint , are actually quite significant ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "we therefore advocate that where a cone jet algorithm is used , it be a seedless variant .",
    "for such a proposal to be realistic it is crucial that the seedless variant be practical .",
    "the approaches adopted in fixed order codes take @xmath133 time and are clearly not suitable in general . here",
    "we have shown that it is possible to carry out exact seedless jet - finding in expected @xmath134 time with @xmath135 storage , or almost exactly . ] in expected @xmath136 time with @xmath137 storage ( we recall that @xmath1 is the total number of particles , @xmath138 the typical number of particles in a jet ) .",
    "the second of these approaches has been implemented in a ` c++ ` code named siscone , available also as a plugin for the fastjet package . for @xmath139 it is comparable in speed to the existing cdf midpoint code with @xmath43 seeds . while this is considerably slower than the @xmath140 and related fastjet strategies  @xcite for the @xmath4 and cambridge / aachen jet algorithms , it remains within the limits of usability and provides for the first time a cone algorithm that is demonstrably infrared and collinear safe at all orders , and suitable for use at parton level , hadron level and detector level .    as well as being infrared safe , a jet algorithm must provide a faithful mapping between expectations based on low - order perturbative considerations , and observations at hadron level .",
    "there has been considerable discussion of worrisome possible violations of such a correspondence for cone algorithms , the `` @xmath110 '' issue . for siscone",
    "we find however that the correspondence holds well .",
    "an obvious final question is that of the impact on physics results of switching from the midpoint to the seedless cone . for inclusive quantities ,",
    "one expects the seedless cone jet algorithm to give results quite similar to those of the midpoint cone , because the ir unsafety of the midpoint algorithm only appears at relatively higher orders .",
    "this is borne out in our fixed order and parton - shower studies of the inclusive jet spectrum where we see differences between the midpoint and siscone algorithms of about a couple of percent . at moderate @xmath32 at hadron level",
    ", the differences can increase to @xmath141 , because siscone has a lower sensitivity to the underlying event , a welcome ` fringe - benefit ' of the seedless algorithm .",
    "for less inclusive quantities , for example the distribution of jet masses in multi - jet events , differences can be significant .",
    "we find that for 3-jet events , the absence of some stable cones ( _ i.e. _  infrared unsafety ) in the midpoint algorithm leads to differences compared to siscone at the @xmath129 level at leading order ( @xmath142 ) in a large part of the jet - mass spectrum .",
    "greater effects still , up to @xmath143 , are seen with specific cuts at fixed order , and in the tails of the jet - mass spectra for parton - shower events .",
    "thus , even if the infrared safety issues of the midpoint algorithm appear to be at the limit of today s accuracy when examining inclusive quantities , for measurements of even moderate precision in multi - jet configurations ( of increasing interest at tevatron and omnipresent at lhc ) , the use of a properly defined cone algorithm such as siscone is likely to be of prime importance .",
    "we are grateful to markus wobisch for many instructive discussions about cone algorithms , steve ellis and joey huston for exchanges about their ir safety and @xmath110 , matteo cacciari for helpful suggestions on the siscone code and giulia zanderighi for highlighting the question of collinear safety .",

    "finally , we thank the galileo galilei institute for theoretical physics for hospitality and the infn for partial support during the completion of this work .",
    "in evaluating the computational complexity of ( computational ) algorithms for various stages of the cone jet algorithm it is necessary to know the numbers of distinct cones and of stable cones .",
    "such information also constitutes basic knowledge about cone jet definitions , which may for example be of relevance in understanding their sensitivity to pileup , _",
    "i.e. _  multiple @xmath144 interactions in the same bunch crossing .    since large multiplicities will be due to pileup , let us consider a simple model for the event structure which mimics pileup , namely a set of momenta distributed randomly in @xmath20 and @xmath21 and all with similar @xmath32 s ( or alternatively with random @xmath32 s in some limited range ) .",
    "given that the particles will be spread out over a region in @xmath20 , @xmath21 that is considerably larger than the cone area , in addition to @xmath1 , the total number of particles , it is useful to introduce also @xmath138 , the number of points likely to be contained in a region of area @xmath145 .    the first question to investigate is that of the number of distinct cones .",
    "the number of pairs of points that has to be investigated is @xmath137 .",
    "however some of these pairs of points will lead to identical cones .",
    "it is natural to ask whether , despite this , the number of distinct cones is still @xmath137 . to answer this question ,",
    "one may examine how far one can displace a cone in any given direction before its point content changes .",
    "the area swept when moving a cone a distance @xmath146 is @xmath147 , and the average number of points intersected is @xmath148 where @xmath149 is the density of points ( per unit area ) .",
    "therefore the distance moved before the cone edge is likely to touch a point is @xmath150 .",
    "correspondingly the area in which one can move the centre of cone without changing the cone s contents is @xmath151 .",
    "given that the total area is @xmath152 we have that the number of distinct cones is @xmath137 , the same magnitude as the number of relevant point pairs .",
    "let us now consider the number of stable cones . if we take a cone at random and sum its momenta then the resulting momentum axis will differ from the original cone axis by an amount typically of order @xmath153 ( since the standard deviation of @xmath20 and @xmath21 for set of points in the cone is @xmath154 ) .",
    "the probability of the difference being @xmath155 in both the @xmath20 and @xmath21 directions ( _ i.e. _  the probability that the new axis contains the same set of particles ) is @xmath156 .",
    "therefore the number of stable cones is @xmath157 .",
    "this assumes a random distribution of particles",
    ". there may exist special classes of configurations for which the number of stable cones is greater than @xmath157 .",
    "therefore timing results that are sensitive to the number of stable cones are to be understood as `` expected '' results rather than rigorous upper bounds .      to study the computational complexity of the split ",
    "merge step , we work with the expectation that there are @xmath157 initial protojets ( as discussed above ) and that there will be roughly @xmath158 final jets ( since there are @xmath159 particles per jet ) .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that there will be roughly equal numbers of merging and splitting operations .",
    "splitting leaves the number of protojets unchanged , while merging reduces it by 1 .",
    "therefore there will be @xmath157 split ",
    "merge steps before we reach the final list of jets .",
    "there are three kinds of tasks in the split ",
    "merge procedure .",
    "firstly one has to maintain a list of jets ordered in @xmath113 , both for finding the one with highest @xmath113 and for searching through the remaining jets ( in order of decreasing @xmath113 ) to find an overlapping one . maintaining the jets in order",
    "is easily accomplished with a balanced tree ( for example a ` priority_queue ` or ` multiset ` in c++ ) , at a cost of @xmath140 for the initial construction and @xmath160 per update , _ i.e. _  a total of @xmath140 , which is small compared to the remaining steps .    in examining the complexity of finding",
    "the hardest overlapping jet one needs to know the cost of comparing two jets for overlap as well as the typical number of times this will have to be done .",
    "a naive comparison of two jets takes time @xmath138 . using a 2d tree structure such as a quadtree or @xmath161-d tree ( as suggested also by volobouev  @xcite ) , this can be reduced to @xmath162 .",
    "the number of jets to be compared before an overlap is found will depend on the event structure  if one assumes that jet positions are decorrelated with their @xmath113 s , then @xmath163 comparisons will have to be made each time around the loop .",
    "the total cost of this will therefore be @xmath164 ( @xmath165 ) with ( without ) a 2d tree .",
    "finally each merging / splitting procedure will take @xmath162 ( @xmath138 ) time with ( without ) a tree , so the total time spent merging and splitting will be @xmath166 ( or @xmath167 without a tree ) .",
    "the dominant step is the search for overlapping jets , which will have a total cost of @xmath164 ( with a sizable coefficient ) , or @xmath165 without any 2d tree structures . since in practice",
    "@xmath165 is smaller than the @xmath168 needed to find the stable cones , here the introduction of a tree structure gives little overall advantage .    a final comment concerns memory usage : when not using any tree structures , the list of protojets and their contents requires @xmath167 space , which is the same order of magnitude as the storage needed for identifying the set of stable cones in the first place . with a tree structure",
    "this can be reduced to @xmath166 .",
    "in this appendix , we shall explicitly prove that siscone , algorithms [ alg : fullcone][alg : splitmerge ] , is infrared safe .",
    "this means that if we run siscone first with a set of hard particles , then with the same set of hard particles together with additional soft particles , then : ( a ) all jets found in the event without soft particles will be found also in the event with the soft particles ; ( b ) any extra jets found in the event with soft particles will themselves be soft , _",
    "i.e. _  they will not contain any of the hard particles .",
    "if either of these conditions fails in a finite region of phasespace for the hard particles , then the cancellation between ( soft ) real and virtual diagrams will be broken at some order of perturbation theory , leading to divergent jet cross sections .",
    "we will first discuss the proof using a simplifying assumption : two protojets with distinct hard particle content have distinct values for the split  merge ordering variable , @xmath113 .",
    "we shall then discuss subtleties associated with various ordering variables , and explain why @xmath113 is a valid choice .      by soft particles ,",
    "we understand particles whose momenta are negligible compared to the hard ones .",
    "specifically , for any set of hard particles @xmath169 and any set of soft ones @xmath170 , we consider a limit in which all soft momenta are scaled to zero , so that they do not affect any momentum sums , @xmath171 in what follows , the limit of the momenta of the soft particles being taken to zero will be implicit .",
    "let us now compare two different runs of the cone algorithm : in the first one , referred to as the `` hard event '' , we compute the jets starting with a list of hard particles @xmath172 , and , in the second one , referred to as the `` hard+soft event '' , we compute the jets with the same set of hard particles plus additional soft particles @xmath173 .",
    "as mentioned above , the ir safety of the siscone algorithm amounts to the statements ( a ) that for every jet in the hard event there is a corresponding jet in the hard+soft event with identical hard particle content ( plus possible extra soft particles ) and ( b ) that there are no hard jets in the hard+soft event that do not correspond to a jet in the hard event . to prove this",
    ", we shall proceed in two steps : first , we shall show that the determination of stable cones is ir safe , then that the split  merge procedure is also ir safe .",
    "* each cone initially built from the hard particles only was determined by two particles in algorithm [ alg : fastcone ] .",
    "this cone is thus still present when adding soft particles and , because of eq .  , is still stable .",
    "hence , all stable cones from the hard event are also present after inclusion of soft particles , the only difference being that they also contain extra soft particles which do not modify their momentum . * no new stable cone containing hard particles",
    "can appear .",
    "indeed , if a new stable cone appeared , @xmath174 with content @xmath175 , then the fact that its momentum @xmath176 corresponds to a stable cone , implies , by eq .",
    "( [ eq : momrel ] ) , that the cone with just the hard momenta @xmath177 is also stable .",
    "however as shown in section  [ sec:2d ] all stable cones in the hard event have already been identified , therefore this cone can not be new .",
    "from these two points , one can deduce that after the determination of the stable cones we end up with two different kinds of stable cones : firstly , there are those that are the same as in the hard event but with possible additional soft particles ; and secondly there are stable cones that contain only soft particles .",
    "so , the ` hard content ' of the stable cones has not been changed upon addition of soft particles and algorithm  [ alg : fastcone ] is ir safe .",
    "the main idea behind the proof of the ir safety of the split ",
    "merge process , algorithm  [ alg : splitmerge ] , is to show by induction that the hard content of the protojets evolves in the same way for the hard and hard+soft event .",
    "since the hard content is the same at the beginning of the process , it will remain so all along the split ",
    "merge process which is what we want to prove .",
    "there is however a slight complication here : when running algorithm  [ alg : splitmerge ] over one iteration of the loop in the hard event , we sometimes have to consider more than one iteration of the loop in the hard+soft event .",
    "as we shall shortly see , in that case , only the last of these iterations modifies the hard content of the jets and it does so in the same way as in the hard event step .",
    "so , let us now follow the steps of algorithm  [ alg : splitmerge ] in parallel for the hard and hard+soft event , and show that they are equivalent as concerns the hard particles . in the following analysis ,",
    "item numbers coincide with the corresponding step numbers in algorithm  [ alg : splitmerge ] .    *",
    "if @xmath25 is non - zero , all purely soft protojets will be removed from the hard+soft event and by eq .",
    "the same set of hard protojets will be removed in the hard and hard+soft event .",
    "thus the correspondence between the hard protojets in the two events will persist independently of @xmath25 . * in general ,",
    "protojets with identical hard content will have nearly identical @xmath113 values , whereas protojets with different hard - particle content will have substantially different @xmath113 values .",
    "therefore the addition of soft particles will not destroy the @xmath113 ordering and the protojet with the largest @xmath113 in the hard event , @xmath178 will have the same hard content as the one in the hard+soft event ( let us call it @xmath179 ) .",
    "* the selection of the highest-@xmath113 protojet @xmath180 ( @xmath181 in the hard+soft case ) that overlaps with @xmath178 ( @xmath179 ) can differ in the hard and hard+soft events , and we need to consider separately the cases where this does not , or does happen .",
    "the first case , c1 , is that @xmath179 and @xmath181 overlap in their hard content  because of the common @xmath113 ordering , @xmath181 must then have the same hard content as @xmath180 . the second case , c2 ,",
    "is that @xmath179 and @xmath181 only overlap through their soft particles , so @xmath181 can not be the ` same ' jet as @xmath180 ( since @xmath180 by definition overlaps with @xmath178 through hard particles ) . by following the remaining part of the loop , we shall show that in the first case all modifications of the hard content are the same in the hard and hard+soft events , while , for the second case , the iteration of the loop in the hard+soft event does not modify any hard content of the protojets . in this second case",
    ", we then proceed to the next iteration of the loop in the hard+soft event but stay at the same one for the hard event . * the two protojets @xmath179 and @xmath181 overlap in their hard content *",
    "* we need to compute the fraction of @xmath113 shared by the two protojets .",
    "since the hard contents of @xmath178 ( @xmath180 ) and @xmath179 ( @xmath181 ) are identical , the fraction of overlap , given by the hard content only , will be the same in the hard and hard+soft events .",
    "hence , the decision to split or merge the protojets will be identical . * * since the centres of both protojets are the same in the hard and hard+soft events , the decision to attribute a hard particle to one protojet or the other will be the same in both events . hence splitting will reorganise hard particles in the same way for the hard+soft event as for the hard one . *",
    "* in both the hard and the hard+soft events , the merging of the two protojets will result in a single protojet with the same hard content .",
    "* the two protojets @xmath179 and @xmath181 overlap through soft particles only * * since the fraction of @xmath113 shared by the protojets will be @xmath182 in the limit eq .  , the two protojets will be split . * * in the splitting , only shared particles , _",
    "i.e. _ soft particles , will be reassigned to the first or second protojet .",
    "the hard content is therefore left untouched , as is the @xmath113 ordering of the protojets .",
    "* at the end of the splitting / merging of the overlapping protojets , we have to consider the two possible overlap cases separately : in the first case , the hard contents of the protojets are modified in the same way for the hard and hard+soft event .",
    "this case is thus ir safe . in the second case",
    ", the iteration of the loop in the hard+soft event does not correspond to any iteration of the loop in the hard event .",
    "however the hard content of the protojets in the hard+soft event is not modified and the @xmath113 ordering of the jets remains identical ; at the next iteration of the hard+soft loop , the new @xmath181 may once again have just soft overlap with @xmath179 and the loop will thus continue iterating , splitting the soft parts of the jets , but leaving the hard content of the jets unchanged .",
    "this will continue until @xmath181 corresponds to the @xmath180 of the hard event , _",
    "i.e. _  we encounter case 1 .",
    "ordering is not modified during the second case , each time around the loop the overlap will involve a @xmath181 with a lower @xmath113 than in the previous iteration , until one reaches the @xmath181 that corresponds to @xmath180 . ]",
    "therefore even though we may have gone around the loop more times in the hard+soft event , we do always reach a stage where the split ",
    "merge operation in the hard+soft event coincides with that in the hard event , and so this part of the procedure is infrared safe .",
    "* up to possible intermediate loops involving case  2 above , when the protojet @xmath178 has no overlapping protojets in the hard event , the corresponding @xmath179 in the hard+soft event has no overlaps either .",
    "final jets will thus be added one by one with the same hard content in the hard and hard+soft events .      * in algorithm  [ alg : splitmerge ] , we do not automatically merge protojets appearing with the same content during the split  merge process .",
    "this is ir safe .",
    "if instead we allow for two identical protojets to be automatically merged , then when two protojets have the same hard content but differ as a result of their soft content , they are automatically merged in the hard event but not in the hard+soft event .",
    "this in turn leads to ir unsafety of the final jets .",
    "a final comment concerns collinear safety and cocircular points .",
    "when defining a candidate cone from a pair of points , if additional points lie on the edge of the cone , then there is an ambiguity as to whether they will be included in the cone . from the geometrical point of view",
    ", this special case of cocircular points ( on a circle of radius r ) can be treated by considering all permutations of the the cocircular points being included or excluded from the circle contents .",
    "siscone contains code to deal with this general issue .",
    "the case of identically collinear particles , though a specific example of cocircularity , also adds the problem that a circle can not properly be defined from two identical points . for explicit collinear safety",
    "we thus simply merge any collinear particles into a single particle , step  [ alg : fastcone : collinear ] of algorithm  [ alg : fastcone ] . given the resulting collinear - safe set of protojets , the split ",
    "merge steps preserve collinear safety , since particles at identical @xmath128 coordinates are treated identically .",
    "suppose we use some generic variable @xmath183 ( which may be @xmath32 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath113 , etc . ) to decide the order in which we select protojets for the split  merge process .",
    "a crucial assumption in the proof of ir safety is that two jets with different hard content will also have substantially different values for @xmath183 , _",
    "i.e. _  the ordering of the @xmath183 s will not be changed by soft modifications . if this is not the case then the choice of the hard protojets that enter a given split ",
    "merge loop iteration can be modified by soft momenta , with a high likelihood that the final jets will also be modified .    at first sight",
    "one might think that whatever variable is used , it will have different values for distinct hard protojets .",
    "however , momentum conservation and coincident masses of identical particles can introduce relations between the kinematic characteristics of distinct protojets .",
    "some care is therefore needed so as to ensure that these relations do not lead to degeneracies in the ordering , with consequent ambiguities and infrared unsafety for the final jets .",
    "in particular :    * two protojets can have equal and opposite transverse momenta if between them they contain all particles in the event ( and the event has no missing energy or ` ignored ' particles such as isolated leptons ) .",
    "it is probably fair to assume that no two protojets will have identical longitudinal components , since in @xmath144 collisions the hard partonic reaction does not occur in the @xmath144 centre of mass frame . * two protojets will have identical masses if they each stem exclusively from the same kind of massive particle .",
    "the two massive particles may be undecayed ( _ e.g. _  fully reconstructed @xmath186-hadrons ) or decayed ( top , @xmath187 , @xmath188 , @xmath189 , or some non - standard new particle ) , or even one decayed and the other not ( some hypothetical particle with a long lifetime ) . of the particle ensures that the two jets actually have slightly different masses , breaking any degeneracies . in practice",
    "however , @xmath190 and ( for a light higgs ) @xmath191 , whereas for the width to save us from the dangers of degeneracies we would need @xmath192 . ] in the second case we can assume that two identical decayed particles have different decay planes , because there is a vanishing phase space for them to have identical decay planes .",
    "note that in a simple two - parton event almost any choice of variable will lead to a degeneracy ( no sensible invariant will distinguish the two particles ) , however this specific case is not problematic because for @xmath38 neither of the two partons can be in a protojet that overlaps with anything else . from the point of view of ir safety , it is only for ` fat ' ( non - collimated ) hard protojets that we need worry about the problem of degeneracies in the split  merge ordering , because only then will there be overlaps whose resolution is ambiguous in the presence of degeneracies .      *",
    "this choice , adopted in certain codes  @xcite , can be seen to have a problem for events with momentum conservation in the hadronic part , because if two non - overlapping protojets contain , between them , all the hard particles then they will have identical @xmath32 s . if they each overlap with a common third protojet , the resulting split  merge sequence will be ambiguous",
    ". table  [ table : sm - pt - problem ] provides an example of such an event .",
    "the simplest occurrences of this problem ( @xmath193 ) apply only to @xmath194 ( four particles must form at least 3 fat protojets ) .",
    "the problem arises also for smaller @xmath9 values , but only at higher multiplicities .",
    "* a workaround for the event of table  [ table : sm - pt - problem ] is to use the transverse mass , @xmath195 . in pure qcd , with all particles",
    "stable , this is a good variable , because even if two fat protojets have identical @xmath32 s through momentum conservation , the fact that they are ` fat ' implies that they will be massive ( over and above intrinsic particle masses ) , and the phase space for them to have identical masses vanishes , thus killing any ir divergences .",
    "however , for events with two identical decaying particles , two fat protojets resulting from the particle decays can have identical @xmath32 s ( by momentum conservation ) and identical masses ( because the decaying particles were identical ) .",
    "this could happen for example in the fully hadronic decay channel for @xmath196 events .",
    "thus , this choice is not advisable in a general purpose algorithm . *",
    "the variable used in the original run  ii proposal was @xmath184  @xcite .",
    "it has the drawback that it is not longitudinally boost invariant : at central rapidity it is equal to @xmath185 , while at high rapidities it tends to @xmath32 .",
    "because the phase space for two protojets to have identical rapidities vanishes ( recall that we do not fix the partonic centre - of - mass ) , two protojets with identical @xmath32 s and masses will have different @xmath184 s , because the degree of ` interpolation ' between between @xmath32 and @xmath185 will be different .",
    "this resolves the degeneracy and should cure the resulting ir safety issue , albeit at the expense of introducing boost - dependence . *",
    "the scalar sum of transverse momenta of the protojet constituents , @xmath113 , has the property that it is equal to @xmath185 if all particles in the protojet have identical rapidities , while it is equal to @xmath32 ( _ i.e. _  the vector sum ) if all particles have identical azimuths . for a decayed massive particle",
    ", it essentially interpolates between @xmath32 and @xmath185 according to the orientation of the decay plane .",
    "the phase space for all particles to have identical azimuths vanishes , as does the phase space for the decay products of two heavy particles to have identically oriented decay planes .",
    "therefore this choice resolves any degeneracies , as is needed for infrared safety .",
    "another advantage of @xmath113 is that adding a particle to a protojet always increases its @xmath113 ( this is not the case for @xmath32 or @xmath184 ) , ensuring that the degree of overlap between a pair of jets is always bounded by @xmath39 . since it is also boost invariant , it is the choice that we recommend and that we adopt as our default .",
    "note that the above considerations hold for any split  merge procedure that relies on ordering the jets according to a single - jet variable . one might also consider ordering according to variables determined from pairs of protojets : e.g. first split - merge the pair of protojets with the largest ( or alternatively smallest ) overlap , recalculate all overlaps , and then repeat until there are no further overlaps .",
    "however this specific example would also be dangerous , since the particles that are common to protojets @xmath5 and @xmath186 ( say ) could also be the particles that are common between @xmath5 and @xmath200 , once again leading to an ambiguous split ",
    "merge sequence .",
    "one protojet - pair ordering variable that might be free of this problem is the @xmath128 distance between the protojets , however we have not investigated it in detail .",
    "a final comment concerns the impact of the split  merge procedure on non - global  @xcite resummations for jets  @xcite , in which one is interested in determining which of a set of ordered soft particles are in a given hard jet . a soft and collinear splitting inside the jet",
    "can modify the @xmath113 ( or @xmath184 or @xmath185 ) of the jet by an amount of the same order of magnitude as a soft , large - angle emission near the edge of the jet . in events with two back - to - back narrow jets , for which there is a near degeneracy between the @xmath113 s of the two hard jets , this can affect which of the two hard protojets split  merges first with an overlapping soft protojet , leading to ambiguities in the assignment of the soft particles to the two hard jets .",
    "this interaction between collinear and soft modes is somewhat reminiscent of that in  @xcite , though the origin and structure are kinematical in our case . considering only branchings with transverse momenta above @xmath201 , for @xmath194",
    "this is likely to be relevant in events with two equally soft particles ( @xmath202 ) and @xmath138 soft - collinear splittings ( @xmath203 ) giving an overall contribution @xmath204 .",
    "this competes with the normal soft - ordered non - global logarithms , starting from order @xmath205 . for @xmath206",
    ", the problem will only arise with a greater number of equally soft large - angle particles , and so will be further suppressed by powers of @xmath207 .",
