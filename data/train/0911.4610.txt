    "the study of the equation of state ( eos ) of nuclear matter has been one of the main challenges of nuclear physics in the last 30 years .",
    "the main strategy for its determination has been the investigation of the pletheora of data from heavy ion experiments in a wide range of beam energies @xmath6 gev . in particular , through the analyisis of collective flows of nucleons and of strange meson production it has been possible to constrain the eos in a wide range of densities up to @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "this endeavor has been performed mainly with respect to the properties of symmetric nuclear matter with an equal number of protons and neutrons .",
    "however , it is known already from the bethe - weizscker mass formula that the difference in the neutron - proton content gives a contribution to the energy called the symmetry energy , i.e. the energy arising from the breaking of the neutron - proton symmetry ( apart form the coulomb energy ) .",
    "the symmetry energy @xmath8 can be defined from the following expansion of the energy density @xmath9 , with @xmath10 and @xmath11 being the total and the isospin densities and @xmath12 the isospin or asymmetry .",
    "the predictions on @xmath2 based on the existing many - body techniques diverge rather widely@xcite both at sub - saturation and supra - saturation densities , as shown in fig.1 ( left ) for several relativistic and non - relativistic models . therefore , while @xmath8 is fairly well constrained around saturation density from nuclear structure its behavior at lower and at higher density is poorly known@xcite .",
    "the study of the @xmath13 below @xmath14 has been intensively pursued in the last ten years looking at a large variety of observables at different reaction mechanisms from giant dipole resonances , pre - equilibrium emission , multi- and neck - fragmentation , isospin diffusion , etc . @xcite .",
    "the present contribution instead focuses on the open issues for the determination of @xmath15 in the high density region which is relevant for neutron star observables , like maximum masses , the mass - radius relation and cooling @xcite , for hybrid star structure and the transition to a deconfined phase @xcite , and for the formation of black holes . in view of the planned experiments at gsi ( asy - eos ) , and of experiments at the future facilities",
    "csr / lanzhou , fair / gsi , ribf / riken , frib / msu@xcite several observables which are sensitive to @xmath8 to the high density region@xcite have been suggested , in particular the @xmath3 and @xmath16 particle ratios and their collective flows and the isospin ratios of meson production @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "we critically review these issues in this contribution .",
    "the determination of @xmath13 at high density @xmath17 needs to exploit hic s at beam energies of @xmath18 in order that the maximum density is sufficiently high . for the theoretical approaches this shifts the energy regime of interest to a range where relativistic effects can start to become significant .",
    "hence relativistic , covariant approaches should be preferred ; nonetheless relativistic extensions of non - relativistic approaches represent a viable way even if they may mix effects of relativity and many - body effects@xcite . in this section",
    "we briefly recall the relativistic structure of @xmath13 in effective models based on nucleons interacting through mesonic fields . at the level presented here the structure of @xmath13",
    "is shared by the different models based on effective lagrangians of quantum - hadro - dynamics ( qhd ) , as the relativistic mean field theory ( rmft)@xcite , the density dependent relativistic hartree approach ( ddrh)@xcite , the effective field theory ( eft ) density functional@xcite as well as the microscopic dbhf@xcite .",
    "therefore the following discussion allows to set a common language that will be useful in the discussion of meson production in sect .",
    "[ sec : mesons ] .    in qhd the effect of nuclear interactions results in in - medium modifications of the scalar effective masses and the energy - momentum four - vector @xmath19 where the different self - energies @xmath20 are labelled by the mesons representative of the specific spin - isospin quantum numbers of field .",
    "the upper and lower signs refer to neutrons and protons , respectively .",
    "the isovector self - energies can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the scalar isospin density and the isospin current , respectively . in the most simple models of rmft the coupling vertices @xmath24 are constant while in more sosphisticated models .",
    "as e.g. the ddhf , they are density and even momentum dependent@xcite .",
    "[ symm - ene ]      the symmetry energy arising from such a structure can be written as@xcite @xmath25 \\rho_{b } \\ ] ] where @xmath26 are the couplings of the nucleons to the effective isovector scalar and vector field .",
    "however already from the hartree - fock theory as well as from the more complete dbhf approach it is clear that each spin - isospin channel receives contributions from all the meson - like fields and the meson label is only indicative of the channel@xcite .",
    "eq.([esymm ] ) can be strictly derived only in rmft , but for our purpose the key point is that @xmath13 arises from a competition of two fields , one scalar and one vector , that at @xmath27 are of the order of @xmath28 mev , as is shown in fig .",
    "1 ( right ) for a standard non - linear ( nl)-rmft model @xcite .",
    "this behaviour is shared by all relativistic approaches , with the difference that for example in ddrh the coupling @xmath29 depends on density , similarly in dbhf .",
    "we stress the distinction between a scalar and a vector field because their balance in a system in equilibrium is generally dynamically broken for an evolving system . in ref.@xcite",
    "it has been shown that such an effect simulates a stiffer symmetry energy in the build - up of collective flows .",
    "in fact , the difference of the force acting on a neutron and a proton moving with momentum @xmath30 can be written , after some approximations , as @xmath31\\vec \\nabla \\rho_3 > \\frac{4}{\\rho_b } e^{pot}_{sym } \\vec \\nabla \\rho_3",
    "\\ : , \\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the lorentz factor @xmath33 . we can see that dynamically the vector field is enhanced and the scalar field suppressed resulting in an effective @xmath34 larger than @xmath35 as can be seen by comparing eqs.([esymm ] ) and ( [ esym - hic ] ) .",
    "hence , the relativistic structure implies a modified relation between @xmath13 and observables in hic s .",
    "of course , one can simulate this relativistic structure with the help of a specific momentum dependence , but this entangles many - body effects with relativistic ones .",
    "a first analysis has shown that such effects are significant for @xmath36 gev @xcite .",
    "the many - body physics involved is indeed more complex than the one sketched above .",
    "in fact , the rmft class of models are derived from a zero - range approximation that makes the meson propagator independent on the momentum . however , the explicit momentum dependence ( md ) originating in the finite range of the interaction is known to be non - negligible in both relativistic and non - relativistic approaches .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that the self - energies of dbhf can not be reproduced by the simple structure of rmft , but an explicit md is necessary .",
    "this has lead to the development of a rmft with derivate coupling @xcite that is able to reproduce the correct energy dependence of the optical potential . in fig .",
    "2 ( left ) the experimental optical potential is compared to the predictions of different theoretical approaches .",
    "we can see that at high momenta @xmath37 also the dbhf is not able to reproduce @xmath38 .",
    "the momentum dependence of the field is usually parametrized in terms of the ( landau ) effective in - medium masses , defined as @xmath39 \\ : , \\ ] ] where we use the index @xmath40 to underline that , in general , they are different for proton and neutrons in asymmetric nuclear matter . the isospin independent part of the optical model has been studied since many years and its behavior has been fairly well determined , see fig .",
    "2 ( left , filled diamonds ) . instead",
    ", the isospin dependence of the optical model , usually discussed in terms of the lane potential @xmath41 , shown in fig.2 ( right ) , is poorly known , and this only in a restricted energy range , @xmath42 , where some data with large uncertainties are available .",

    ", width=374,height=220 ]    we will see that all the observables under investigation are in principle affected by the md of the mean fields .",
    "this represents a further obstacle for the determination of @xmath13 especially at high @xmath43 , because the importance of md is expected to increase with energy .",
    "however , the possibility to have access experimentally to several observables as a function of momentum in a wide range offers the real possibility to constrain such a dependence .",
    "generally , all rmft approaches give @xmath44 , while in non - relativistic approaches generally @xmath45 with some exceptions@xcite .",
    "non - relativistic bhf@xcite would indicate the last choice as the correct one , which means that @xmath46 decreases with @xmath37 . in rmft one",
    "finds the opposite trend but it lacks the effect of the finite range of the interaction . in dbhf both relativistic fields and the finite range effect are included , but there exists an ambiguity from the method used to project on the different lorentz amplitudes@xcite .",
    "one could judge that the microscopic approaches favour the relation @xmath45 , but in any case it is mandatory to show that this is the case in hic by means of a comparison with the available and forthcoming data .",

    "one can reach densities of about @xmath49 for a time interval of the order of 15 - 20 fm / c .",
    "more interestingly , it is possible to find a kinematical region ( @xmath50 ) where the @xmath3 and @xmath51 ratios of emitted particles as a function of the transverse momentum depend mainly on the neutron - proton splitting of the effective masses and are nearly independent of the stiffness of @xmath13 . in fig . 3",
    "one sees that the @xmath3 ratio exhibits a strong dependence for @xmath52 depending on the sign of the splitting of the effective masses . for @xmath44",
    "the difference between the neutron and proton mean fields increases with momentum and the more energetic neutrons feel an increasing repulsion resulting in a larger @xmath3 ratio .",
    "the opposite is true for the case @xmath44 .",
    "the key point of our result @xcite is that especially at high @xmath53 the effect is almost independent on the stiffness of the symmetry energy allowing to disentangle the dependence on the momentum from that on the density .",
    "instead , for lower beam energies and in the low momentum region the pre - equilibrium emission is found to depend significantly on both the stiffness of @xmath13 and the isospin md .",
    "the study of the symmetry energy at high density implies to investigate hic s at higher energy where a system at sufficiently high density is created . on the other hand ,",
    "then the energy becomes large enough to excite the lower mass mesonic states , namely pions and kaons .",
    "therefore symmetry energy effects are transferred to the production of mesons . in ref.@xcite",
    "it was suggested that the @xmath4 ratio is sensitive to @xmath2 .",
    "it was demonstrated that the main effect consists in the emission of nucleons during the evolution depending on @xmath13 leading to a different @xmath3 content of the residual system , which in turn influences the formation of the different charge states of the pion .",

    "the inset shows the differential @xmath5 ratio as a function of the kaon emission time.,width=364,height=211 ]    even if this mechanism seems quite straightforward one may doubt its real effectiveness .",
    "indeed , the idea of using pions to determine the symmetric part of the eos has suffered from the fact that pions strongly interact with nucleons and are produced during the whole evolution of the collision system making it difficult to associate their production to a specific density reached during the collision . in that context",
    "it was suggested by aichelin and ko@xcite that kaons are a better probe of the eos .",
    "the reason is manifold : kaons have a higher threshold energy , hence they are produced only in the high density phase .",
    "moreover , once produced they interact weakly with nucleons and their width with respect to the mass is quite small making a quasi - particle approximation more reliable . after nearly 20 years the effort to determine",
    "the symmetric eos by kaon production has been successfull and is summarised in ref.@xcite .",
    "following the same line of thinking the catania group has suggested to investigate the @xmath5 ratio as a better probe of the @xmath13 at high density @xcite ( the other isospin pair with anti - kaons @xmath60 suffers from the strong coupling to the medium ) .    using a relativistic transport approach ( relativistic boltzmann - hling - uhlenbeck , rbuu@xcite ) we have analyzed pion and kaon production in central @xmath61 collisions in the @xmath62 beam energy range , comparing models with the same `` soft '' eos for symmetric matter and with different effective field choices for @xmath8 .",
    "4 reports the temporal evolution of @xmath63 resonances , pions ( @xmath54 ) and kaons ( @xmath55 ) for central au+au collisions at @xmath64@xcite it is clear that , while the pion yield freezes out at times of the order of @xmath65 , i.e. at the final stage of the reaction ( and at low densities ) , kaon production occurs within the very early ( compression ) stage , and the yield saturates at around @xmath66 , when the nucleon and @xmath67 densities reach their maximum value . from fig .",
    "4 we see that the pion multiplicities are moderately dependent on the isospin part of the nuclear mean field . however , a slight increase ( decrease ) in the @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) multiplicity is observed when going from a nl - rmft model without isovector fields ( nl ) to one with a @xmath43 meson ( @xmath70 ) and with @xmath43 and @xmath71 mesons ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "this trend is more pronounced for kaons , see the right panel , due to the high density selection of the source and the proximity to the production threshold . in fig . 5 ( left ) the pion and kaon rations from these calculations are shown as a function of beam energy .",
    "the ratios decrease with beam energy , because the relative effects of mean fields and thresholds become less important .",
    "however , the greater sensitivitiy of the kaon ratios is seen clearly .",

    "such a finding appears in strong disagreement with other studies that exploit the elliptic flow to extract the slope of @xmath13 around and above the saturation density @xcite .",
    "however there are circumstantial reasons to be careful . indeed ,",
    "the physics involved in the in - medium particle production has many aspects and a comprehensive and self - consistent approach is necessary before extracting the isospin dependence of the interaction .    the effect described in ref.@xcite essentially is due to the fact that a stiff @xmath13 causes a neutron - rich emission of nucleons in the early stages of the reaction leaving the system too symmetric in isospin content to reproduce the @xmath4 ratio of fopi . on the other hand , if one employs an @xmath2 that just above @xmath14 decreases with density generating an isospin force that is attractive for the neutrons it is possible to get close to the data , see fig . 5 ( right ) .",
    "however , we note that it is mandatory to check if one can reproduce at the same time the @xmath3 emission as a function of @xmath53 especially at the high @xmath53 relevant for pion production , since this represents the complementary signal for the soft @xmath13",
    ". this would be a first test of the claim for a very soft @xmath8 and in case of failure it will provide evidence that there are other mechanism determining the in - medium meson production .",
    "indeed , we already know that there are at least other three effects competing with the mean field effect on the @xmath3 emission .",
    "these are the so - called `` threshold effect '' emphasized by the calculation of ref.s @xcite , the momentum dependence of the isospin - dependent cross sections , and the the isospin mass shift of pions due to the coupling to @xmath75hole excitation@xcite .",
    "these will be discussed in the following .",
    "the `` threshold effect '' is due to the fact that the masses of nucleons and delta s are modified in the medium .",
    "the unknown self - energies of the delta s are usually specified in terms of the neutron and proton ones by the use of clebsch - gordon coefficients for the isospin coupling of the @xmath67 to nucleons @xcite .",
    "these medium modifications are isospin dependent , eq.([iso - selfene ] ) .",
    "this influences the phase - space available for meson production in a nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) collision because it modifies the difference between the invariant energy in the entrance channel @xmath76 with respect to the production threshold @xmath77 .",
    "this effect is , of course , present in general for all meson productions , but for brevity we concentrate here on one inelastic channel : @xmath78 , mainly responsible for @xmath79 production . from eq.([eff - mass ] ) the invariant energy in the entrance channel and the threshold energy are given , respectively , by    @xmath80\\stackrel{p=0}{\\rightarrow}\\left[m^{*}_{n } + \\sigma^{0}_{\\omega}+\\sigma^{0}_{\\rho}+\\sigma_{\\delta}\\right]>m^{*}_{n}+\\sigma^{0}_{\\omega } \\nonumber\\\\ \\sqrt{s_{th}}= \\left[m^{*}_{p}+m^{*}_{\\delta^-}+\\sigma_{0}(p)+\\sigma_{0}(\\delta^-)\\right]= \\left[m^{*}_{n}+m^{*}_{\\delta}+2 \\sigma_{\\omega } \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath81 are the isospin averaged values .",
    "the last equality for the threshold energy is valid due to the prescription for the delta self - energies noted above , which leads to an exact compensation of the isospin - dependent parts , hence the threshold @xmath77 is not modified by isospin dependent self - energies . in generally in a self - consistent many - body calculation",
    "higher order effects can destroy this exact balance .",
    "but this is not so important for our qualitative discussion , since there will always be a compensating effects in @xmath77 .",
    "on the other hand , the energy available in the entrance channel , @xmath76 , is shifted in an explicitely isospin dependent way by the in - medium self - energy @xmath82 .",
    "especially , the vector self - energy gives a positive contribution to neutrons that increases the difference @xmath83 and hence increases the cross section of the inelastic process due to the opening up of the phase - space , expecially close to threshold .",
    "a similar modification but opposite in sign is present in @xmath83 for the @xmath84 channel that therefore is suppressed by the isospin effect on the self - energies .",
    "hence , due to the described threshold effect the ratio @xmath85 increases with the stiffness of @xmath13 which is associated with a large @xmath86 .",
    "this is at the origin of the result in fig . 5 ( left ) .",
    "of course , the rbuu calculation contains also the mean field effect on the isospin content but the final result appears to be dominated by the threshold effect .",
    "in fact , it is seen that @xmath85 increases with the increasing stiffness of @xmath13 and the effect is stronger closer to the threshold energy .",
    "the threshold effect described constitutes one physical effect that is present in the in - medium meson production and results in an opposite dependence on @xmath13 relative to the mean field effect on the emission of neutrons and protons . on the other hand",
    "this does not mean that in ref.@xcite the effect is quantitatively described in the more realistic way .",
    "there are at least two other physical aspects that have to be considered .",
    "one is the fact that the self - energies in the implementation of rbuu is not explicitly momentum dependent as it is in dbhf and as the study of the optical potential shows , see fig .",
    "2 ( right ) .",
    "thus we return to the importance of the isospin momentum dependence discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : isospinmomentumdependence ] . because we neglect the dependence of the self - energies on momentum , the difference @xmath83 in eq.([threshold ] ) increases strongly with the momentum @xmath87 . the problem is directly related to the strong energy dependence of the optical potential in rmft in fig .",
    "therefore it is likely that a more realistic calculation which includes a @xmath88 will reduce the effect seen in fig .",
    "5 . in addition a fully consistent treatment should include an optical potential also for the pions .",
    "it can be envisaged that a stronger sensitivity to @xmath89 can be seen looking at @xmath85 as a function of the pion transverse energy .",
    "another key point in the study of the isospin effects is the isospin dependence of the cross section for the inelastic processes .",
    "in fact the same medium effects that produce the threshold effect discussed above also modify the cross section of the pertinent inelastic processes .",
    "the problem of the self - consistency between the mean field and the cross section is known for many years , however , in the case under discussion it seems to be much more relevant .",
    "in fact one can simulate the effect of a repulsive mean field , e.g. on collective flow , by increasing the cross section .",
    "however , if one plays with the cross section for inelastic collisions it will manifest itself in the number of particles that are produced and measured . in this respect the calculations of pion and kaon yields of ref.@xcite take into account only one consequence of medium effects , namely the isopin dependent self - energies .",
    "it is likely that simultaneously taking into account the isospin dependence of the cross section can dampen the effect of self - energies on @xmath83 .",
    "another effect that is certainly present is the modification of the pion spectral function which in an asymmetric medium becomes isospin dependent .",
    "the effect has been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , see also the contribution of c.m .",
    "ko in these proceedings .",
    "this work shows that the increased strength at low energies of the @xmath79 relative to the @xmath90 spectral function in dense asymmetric nuclear matter modifies the expected thermal @xmath4 ratio with respect to the one with vacuum masses .",
    "the effect is comparable in size to the mean field effect on @xmath3 ratios of emitted nucleons , but again goes in the opposite direction : larger @xmath8 implies larger @xmath4 ratios .",
    "therefore it would be important to include such an effect in the transport models , even if it means to go beyond the simple quasi - particle approximation . from this point of view",
    "it would be desirable to have calculations with transport codes including off - shell effects@xcite .",
    "considering these various issues that are involved in the determination of the @xmath4 as well as the @xmath91 ratios the circumstantial evidence for a very soft @xmath13 at high density should be considered only as a first step that opened the discussion . instead",
    ", there is a need for theoretical improvements in the transport models to match the upcoming availability of experiments able to scrutiny more precisely the isopin dependence of observables in heavy ion collisions .",
    "the determination of @xmath2 above the saturation density by means of hic s is indeed at the beginning",
    ". with increasing energy the momentum dependence of the mean field determines the subsequent dynamics .",
    "therefore the study of the @xmath13 is entangled with the isospin effects on the momentum dependence .",
    "this affects not only the nucleon dynamics but also the isopin content of the meson production .",
    "we discussed several issues which from a theorethical point of view require further development of the present transport theories for the study of the isospin dependence of meson production . from the experimental point of view the possibility to look at observables especially as a function of momentum should allow to really constrain the @xmath13 in the high density region .",
    "however a key point of the search for the high - density symmetry energy should be to look at several observables in the same reaction simultaneously which should help not to put under the carpet the important mechanisms at work in hic dynamics .",
    "v. greco would like to thank the organizers of iwdn09 for their warm hospitality and t. gaitanos for useful comments on the preparation of the talk ."
