    "mass discrepancy ( or missing mass ) problems in galaxies , galaxy clusters and the universe have usually been attributed to dark matter ( dm ) assuming that standard newton - einstein gravity is valid in those dynamical systems ( for reviews , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the currently popular lambda cold dark matter ( @xmath2cdm ) cosmological paradigm of the universe provides a successful phenomenological model of the large - scale structure , the cosmological microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) anisotropy power spectrum , and the expansion history of the universe ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "theories of galaxy formation and evolution based on the @xmath2cdm paradigm have also been making progress with the goal of explaining the rich phenomenology of galaxies ( for a review see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    however , in the realm ( where dynamics is non - linear ) of galaxies the @xmath2cdm paradigm appears to face serious challenges .",
    "rotation curves of disc galaxies start to deviate from newtonian expectation all at the same critical acceleration scale @xmath3 regardless of galaxy size , luminosity , surface brightness or any other property ( @xcite ) .",
    "the velocity at the flat part of the rotation curve is well correlated with the total baryonic mass of the galaxy ( consistent with zero intrinsic scatter ) spanning five orders - of - magnitude in baryonic mass from giant spiral galaxies to low surface brightness galaxies ; this correlation is now known as the baryonic tully - fisher relation ( @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , to every feature in an individual rotation curve there corresponds a feature in baryonic mass density profile even in galaxies whose dynamics should be dominated by dm if the @xmath2cdm paradigm is assumed ( @xcite ) .",
    "the apparent existence of the critical acceleration @xmath4 and the intimate connection between the galaxy rotation curve and the baryonic mass distribution seems unnatural in the @xmath2cdm paradigm .",
    "other outstanding challenges of the @xmath2cdm paradigm in galaxies such as the number and distribution of dm subhaloes and the dm central cusp / core density profile are also well documented in the literature ( @xcite ) .",
    "milgrom s modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ; @xcite ) offers an alternative paradigm that can by - pass the above challenges of rotating galaxies faced by the @xmath2cdm paradigm .",
    "the mond paradigm posits that newton s law of gravity breaks down at extremely low accelerations below the critical acceleration @xmath4 .",
    "then , the phenomenological existence of @xmath4 , the baryonic tully - fisher relation , and so on can be unified in a single mond law ( see @xcite for an extensive review ) . whether the empirical mond law can be ultimately explained by a fundamental law of modified gravity or somehow by revised theories of galaxy formation under the @xmath2cdm paradigm ,",
    "it is clearly worthwhile as a kepler - like law of galactic kinematics .",
    "if the remarkable success of the mond paradigm in rotating galaxies implies an underlying law , it must also explain the empirical properties of spheroidal early - type ( elliptical and lenticular ) galaxies ( etgs ) that are different from disc galaxies in dynamics and structure . in this respect",
    "it is quite interesting to test mond in etgs .",
    "however , testing mond ( or dm ) in etgs is far more challenging because they lack neutral hydrogens ( the crucial dynamical tracer for disc galaxies ) and orbits of stars ( and other tracers ) are complex ( and/or unknown ) .",
    "nevertheless , significant efforts have been made to test mond ( and dm ) in etgs using dynamical tracers such as stars , planetary nebulae ( pne ) , globular clusters ( gcs ) , hot x - ray gases , satellite galaxies , and gravitational lensing . despite significant efforts ,",
    "it is not yet clear whether mond can provide a successful phenomenological model for the dynamics of etgs .",
    "sometimes , analyses of the same galaxies often reached different conclusions .",
    "based on the kinematics of pne ( out to @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the effective radius ) of three elliptical galaxies , @xcite argued that mond could explain the observed kinematics well and no dm would be needed .",
    "however , for the same galaxies @xcite argued that dm would be consistent with the data once radially varying velocity dispersion ( vd ) anisotropies were allowed .",
    "independent analyses of pne kinematics of two other ellipticals by @xcite and @xcite showed that mond could explain the kinematics without dm . based on the velocity dispersion profiles ( vdps ) of stacked sdss satellite galaxies around two narrow luminosity ranges of red galaxies @xcite and @xcite reached opposite conclusions respectively against and for mond because of their different assumptions on the profiles of density and vd anisotropy of satellites .",
    "@xcite tested mond using the mass profiles of two x - ray bright elliptical galaxies deduced assuming hydrostatic equilibrium and found that mond successfully reproduced the profiles over a wide acceleration range from @xmath7 ( near the galactic centre ) down to @xmath8 ( over 100 - 200 kpc ) .",
    "analyses of ( the masses of ) strong lens etgs also produced confusing results , some arguing against mond ( e.g.  @xcite ) while others for mond ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "based on the kinematics of gcs ( out to several @xmath6 ) several studies ( @xcite ) tested mond in a handful of elliptical galaxies .",
    "in particular , @xcite carried out a systematic analysis of ten elliptical galaxies covering a broad range of mass .",
    "these studies of gc kinematics employed spherical jeans analyses assuming isotropy or relatively simple anisotropies . according to these studies , as @xcite emphasized , mond alone without an additional dm component could not provide a successful fit for several massive slow rotators in their outer regions ( beyond @xmath9 ) , although mond was generally successful for less massive fast rotators ( where the slow / fast dichotomy is in the sense by @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite also advocated the need of dm under mond in the central massive galaxy of the fornax cluster .",
    "it is unclear whether these results imply the breakdown of mond for a class of elliptical galaxies .",
    "the main limits of these studies are small sample sizes and uncertainties in vd anisotropy .",
    "a rigorous test of mond in etgs would require ( 1 ) a statistically representative sample of etgs and ( 2 ) an empirical probe of mass profile over a wide acceleration range . here , we propose a test of mond in elliptical galaxies satisfying the first requirement to a large extent and the second requirement only partially .",
    "we calculate mond - based vdps of @xmath0 nearly round galaxies from chae , bernardi & kravtsov ( 2014 ) for @xmath10 using the observed stellar mass distributions under a variety of possibilities of vd anisotropy .",
    "we calculate the slopes of the vdps for @xmath11 and compare the distribution of the slopes with the measured distribution in a similarly selected sample of 11 nearly round atlas@xmath1 ( @xcite ) galaxies .",
    "hence our analysis is statistical in nature .",
    "we describe the data and the method of analysis in section  2 and the results in section  3 .",
    "we discuss implications of our results for mond and give our conclusions in section  4 .",
    "we consider only elliptical galaxies that are nearly round so that they can be analysed based on the spherical symmetry assumption with minimal error . a statistically representative sample of nearly round galaxies can be drawn from the immense sloan digital sky survey ( sdss : @xcite ) data base .",
    "we use a sample of sdss galaxies defined and analysed under the @xmath2cdm paradigm by @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that contains photometric parameters recently investigated and measured by @xcite and @xcite based on data release ( dr ) 7 data.ameert/fit@xmath12catalog/download/ ] the sample contains 2054 elliptical galaxies with a mean redshift of @xmath13 spanning two orders of magnitude in stellar mass that are nearly round ( projected minor - to - major axis ratio @xmath14 ) and do not possess a measurable disc .    because each galaxy has no measurable disc by selection",

    "deprojecting equation  ( [ eq : ser ] ) we obtain a volume luminosity density profile @xmath18 and then a stellar mass density profile through a stellar initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "( for our selected galaxies gas is ignorable particularly because they do not possess a measurable disc . )",
    "each galaxy has also a measured vd @xmath19 within the sdss aperture of @xmath20  arcsec radius which corresponds to a physical radius between @xmath21 and @xmath6 with a mean of @xmath22 .",
    "note that @xmath19 denotes a luminosity - weighted average of line - of - sight velocity dispersions ( losvds ) of all stars within the aperture .    under the standard newtonian dynamics",
    "the observed vd @xmath19 may be reproduced by adjusting the stellar mass - to - light ( @xmath23 ) ratio or equivalently the stellar imf for a flexible assumption of dm mass profile ( even including the case of no dm ) given the empirical intrinsic galaxy - to - galaxy scatter of imf .",
    "this means that @xmath19 ( an average quantity within a region ) itself may not be a sensitive probe of gravity or mass distribution .",
    "however , the vdp is a powerful probe .",
    "the observed vdp of an individual galaxy over a radial range can be used to infer the total mass profile for that range under newtonian dynamics ( e.g.  @xcite ) . for a large sample of galaxies that do not have individually measured vdps one can , as done in @xcite , predict vdps using galaxy models satisfying the available observational constraints , and then compare the statistical distribution of vdps with an available empirical distribution .",
    "such a comparison of vdp slope distributions clearly shows that galaxies must be embedded in dm halos to match the empirical distribution if newtonian dynamics is assumed to be valid at all acceleration scale ( see @xcite and below ) .",
    "here we carry out a similar statistical analysis of vdp slopes under mond .",
    "our analysis is based on the spherical jeans equation given in mond ( e.g.  @xcite ) by @xmath24}{dr }   + 2 \\frac{\\beta(r)}{r } [ \\rho(r ) \\sigma_{\\rm r}^2(r ) ] = -\\rho(r ) g(r ) , \\label{eq : jeans}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the volume luminosity density at radius @xmath25 , @xmath26 is the radial stellar vd , and @xmath27 is the vd anisotropy given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the tangential vd in spherical coordinates . in equation  ( [ eq : jeans ] ) @xmath30 is the mondian ( ` effective ' or ` real ' ) gravitational acceleration which differs from the newtonian acceleration @xmath31 for the baryonic ( stellar here ) mass @xmath32 within @xmath25 .",

    "may particularly matter for those in the central regions of galaxy clusters and those having close neighbors .",

    "the functional form given by equation  ( [ eq : ifmun ] ) , mean anisotropy @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 give , respectively , @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "for the case of radially varying anisotropy there is an overall shift of @xmath160 for the same value of mean anisotropy so that the traditionally standard model @xmath55 is disfavoured .",
    "these manifest a degeneracy between mond interpolating function and vd anisotropy , which is reminiscent of the well - known mass - anisotropy degeneracy under standard dynamics ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this interpolating function - anisotropy degeneracy can be alleviated by a more precise empirical value of @xmath142 or prior constraints on anisotropy .",
    "our analysis has been limited to nearly round galaxies ( under the spherical symmetry assumption ) in the intermediate acceleration regime although they cover a broad range of mass and size .",
    "a mond analysis of etgs of any ellipticity is considerably more challenging but would be necessary for a more rigorous test of mond in spheroidal systems .",
    "if a random sample of elliptical galaxies ( drawn from the same sdss parent sample of etgs using the same criteria except for the ellipticity limit ) is analysed based on the mond spherical jeans equation ( equation  [ eq : jeans ] ) , the resulting @xmath89-distribution has a similar mean but a somewhat larger scatter , probably hinting that mond works also for etgs of any ellipticity .",
    "our analysis provides a novel and rigorous test of mond in spheroidal galaxies in the sense that it is based on a statistically representative sample of spheroidal galaxies and a range of possibilities of vd anisotropy .",
    "our test is most sensitive at @xmath161 where gravitational acceleration @xmath33 due to the baryonic mass distribution is @xmath162 ( fig .",
    "[ grange ] ) . however , our galaxies cover the range @xmath163 ( see fig .  1 of @xcite ) for which @xmath164 ( fig .",
    "[ grange ] ) .",
    "our results support the view that mond suggested by dynamics of rotating galaxies is also likely to be valid for dispersion - supported galaxies in their inner regions ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "our results are in line with the test of mond through hydrostatic equilibrium in two x - ray bright elliptical galaxies over a wide acceleration range by @xcite .    in this work we could not separately consider slow and fast rotators because the necessary kinematic information is not available for the analysed sdss galaxies .",
    "the fact that the similarly selected atlas@xmath1 elliptical galaxies are nearly evenly divided ( see section  2 ) hints that the sdss sample may also contain both kinematic classes , although it is likely to be somewhat biased towards slow rotators as the galaxies are on average more massive and larger than the atlas@xmath1 counterparts ( see fig .  [ gdist ] ) .",
    "recently , @xcite carried out individual jeans modelling of ten elliptical galaxies , four of whom are slow rotators , based on observed gc kinematic data up to several effective radii . considering two cases of constant anisotropy @xmath165 , @xmath124 and one case of radially varying @xmath166 for mond interpolating functions of @xmath56 , @xmath126 in equation  ( [ eq : ifmun ] ) and that of equation  ( [ eq : ifmubek ] ) , @xcite could not find successful fits of slow rotators without additional component of dm beyond @xmath167-@xmath99 .",
    "for one galaxy ngc 4486 ( m87 ) , which is in the central region of a cluster , the considered mond models and anisotropies had difficulty of fitting gc kinematic data even in the inner region ( @xmath168 ) . however , as @xcite notes , it remains unclear whether these problems based on limited cases of anisotropies imply breakdown of mond for certain objects . in this work",
    "we have considered a broader range of possibilities of anisotropy and found that vdps of a mixed population of fast and slow rotators for @xmath169 could be statistically explained by mond without any dm .",
    "if the empirical mond law is to be truly meaningful , there must exist a universal interpolating function .",
    "studies up to the present indicate that this is a reasonable possibility .",
    "however , a firm conclusion can only be reached through precise determination of interpolating functions of galaxies of various types .",
    "our analysis shows that the statistics of vdps of elliptical galaxies provides a useful tool to test interpolating functions .",
    "this statistical analysis can complement individual analyses that can be performed with detailed kinematic data ( e.g.  @xcite ) . despite its current limits",
    ", our analysis appears to support the simple interpolating function [ equation  ( [ eq : ifmun ] ) with @xmath56 ] ( see figs .",
    "[ vdpconst ] and [ vdpvar ] ) , which has also been preferred by galaxy rotation data ( e.g.  @xcite ) and studies of elliptical galaxies [ see @xcite and references therein ] , although we can not yet rule out the traditionally standard model with @xmath55 or even the interpolating function ( equation  [ eq : ifmubek ] ) implied by bekenstein s modified gravity ( @xcite ) .",
    "if a single interpolating function turns out to explain dynamics of all galaxies , that would have far - reaching implications . in this respect it would be quite interesting to empirically verify and determine the supposed universal mond interpolating function with future data .",
    "for spheroidal galaxies both statistical ( for large samples , as was demonstrated in this study ) and individual ( for large radial extent , performed earlier and ongoing ) analyses of vdps will be useful .",

    "<S> modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) proposed by milgrom provides a paradigm alternative to dark matter ( dm ) that has been successful in fitting and predicting the rich phenomenology of rotating disc galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> there have also been attempts to test mond in dispersion - supported spheroidal early - type galaxies , but it remains unclear whether mond can fit the various empirical properties of early - type galaxies for the whole ranges of mass and radius . as a way of rigorously testing mond in elliptical galaxies we calculate the mond - predicted velocity dispersion profiles ( vdps ) in the inner regions of @xmath0 nearly round sdss elliptical galaxies under a variety of assumptions on velocity dispersion ( vd ) anisotropy , and then compare the predicted distribution of vdp slopes with the observed distribution in 11 atlas@xmath1 galaxies selected with essentially the same criteria . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the mond model parameterised with an interpolating function that works well for rotating galaxies can also reproduce the observed distribution of vdp slopes based only on the observed stellar mass distribution without dm or any other galaxy - to - galaxy varying factor . </S>",
    "<S> this is remarkable in view that newtonian dynamics with dm requires a specific amount and/or profile of dm for each galaxy in order to reproduce the observed distribution of vdp slopes . </S>",
    "<S> when we analyse non - round galaxy samples using the mond - based spherical jeans equation , we do not find any systematic difference in the mean property of the vdp slope distribution compared with the nearly round sample . </S>",
    "<S> however , in line with previous studies of mond through individual analyses of elliptical galaxies , varying mond interpolating function or vd anisotropy can lead to systematic change in the vdp slope distribution , indicating that a statistical analysis of vdps can be used to constrain specific mond models with an accurate measurement of vdp slopes or a prior constraint on vd anisotropy .    </S>",
