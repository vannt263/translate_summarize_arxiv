    "in the last years important efforts have been done to determine the density dependence of the symmetry energy of asymmetric nuclear matter ( see the reviews @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "correlations between different quantities in bulk matter and finite nuclei have been established .",
    "for instance , the correlation between the slope of the pressure of neutron matter at @xmath0 @xmath1 and the neutron skin thickness of @xmath2pb @xcite , or the correlation between the crust - core transition density and the neutron skin thickness of @xmath2pb @xcite are well determined .",
    "presently , there also exist different experimental measurements that constrain the saturation properties of the symmetry energy @xcite .",
    "the quark - meson - coupling ( qmc ) model  @xcite is an effective nuclear model that takes into account the internal structure of the nucleon explicitly . within the qmc model ,",
    "matter at low densities and temperatures is a system of nucleons interacting through meson fields , with quarks and gluons confined within mit bags @xcite . for matter at very high density or temperature , one expects that baryons and mesons dissolve and that the entire system of quarks and gluons becomes confined within a single , big , mit bag . within qmc",
    "it is possible to describe in a consistent way both nucleons and hyperons @xcite .",
    "the energy of the baryonic mit bag is identified with the mass of the baryon and is obtained self - consistently from the calculation .",
    "it is important to stress that within the qmc model the coupling of hyperons to the @xmath3-meson is fixed at the level of the saturation properties of the equation of state ( eos ) .",
    "hypernuclei properties @xcite will then allow the determination of the coupling of hyperons to the isoscalar - vector meson without any ambiguity except for the uncertainty on the experimental hypernuclei data .",
    "within the non - linear walecka models ( nlwm ) this is not possible and some other constraint must be imposed , such as using the su(6 ) symmetry to fix the hyperon - vector meson couplings @xcite .",
    "recently , new data on neutron stars have been obtained @xcite that theory should explain , namely , the large value 1.97 @xmath4 0.04 @xmath5 of the recent mass measurement of the binary millisecond pulsar psr j16142230 @xcite , and the empirical eos obtained by steiner _",
    "from a heterogeneous set of seven neutron stars with well - determined distances @xcite which predicts quite small radii .",
    "these last results , however , should still be considered with care because there are many uncertainties involved .",
    "the symmetry energy at saturation is quite well established , however , the density dependence of the symmetry energy is not so well known and different models predict a wide range of values for the symmetry energy slope at saturation . although the symmetry energy slope of qmc at saturation ( 94 mev @xcite ) is within the range of values compatible with experimental observations @xcite , most of the experimental observables that have been proposed to obtain a measure of the symmetry energy slope , predict smaller slopes @xcite , which could be as low as 30 mev",
    ". moreover , the large value of the qmc slope prohibits the prediction of small radii as the ones indicated by the empirical eos @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "we have introduced the @xmath6-meson in the qmc model and have studied its effect on the density dependence of the symmetry energy and subsaturation instabilities of nuclear matter .",
    "however , the introduction of the @xmath6-meson gives rise to a stiffer symmetry energy and this mechanism will not allow us to obtain a softer symmetry energy for the qmc .    in the present study we consider an extension of the qmc that includes a nonlinear term involving the @xmath7 and @xmath8 mesons .",
    "this term affects the isovector channel of the qmc equation of state , namely the density dependence of the symmetry energy @xcite , and choosing the coupling constant adequately it is possible to correct the stiff behavior of the symmetry energy at large densities in the qmc model .",
    "stellar matter within the modified qmc model will be studied .",
    "we expect that smaller values of the symmetry energy slope will give rise to smaller star radii : this has been shown both for nucleonic stars @xcite and for hyperonic stars @xcite .",
    "in particular , we want to investigate how the hyperon content of a compact star is affected by the density dependence of the symmetry energy .",
    "this was recently done within the nlwm including the nonlinear @xmath9 term @xcite and it was shown that the hyperon content could be affected by the density dependence of the symmetry energy , and that the radius of stars with a mass 1 - 1.4 @xmath5 increases linearly with the slope , while the mass is not affected .",
    "however , the qmc model gives rise to a softer eos and generally predicts smaller hyperon fractions in stellar matter .",
    "this could affect the behavior of the star properties and its relation with the slope of the symmetry energy .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii an extension of the qmc model to include the @xmath10 coupling is discussed , in section iii results are presented and discussed and the final conclusions are drawn in the last section .",
    "in what follows we present a review of the qmc model and its generalization to include the isoscalar - isovector @xmath10 coupling .    in the qmc model , the nucleon in nuclear medium",
    "is assumed to be a static spherical mit bag in which quarks interact with the scalar ( @xmath3 ) and vector ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) fields , and those are treated as classical fields in the mean field approximation ( mfa ) @xcite .",
    "the quark field , @xmath11 , inside the bag then satisfies the equation of motion : @xmath12 \\,\\psi_{q_{i}}=0\\ , %   \\label{eq - motion}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 , @xmath14 with @xmath15 the current quark mass , and @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 denote the quark - meson coupling constants .",
    "the energy of a static bag describing baryon @xmath19 consisting of three quarks in ground state is expressed as @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the bag radius of baryon @xmath19 , @xmath23 is the dimensionless quark momentum , @xmath24 is a parameter which accounts for zero - point motion of baryon @xmath19 and @xmath25 is the bag constant .",
    "the effective mass of a baryon bag at rest is taken to be @xmath26 the equilibrium condition for the bag is obtained by minimizing the effective mass , @xmath27 with respect to the bag radius @xmath28 we have considered @xmath29 mev and @xmath30 fm .",
    "the unknowns @xmath24 are given in @xcite .",
    "the consideration of a coupling between the isoscalar and isovector fields is carried out much like in the manner it was performed in @xcite .",
    "a note is however on demand : we start out from quarks , which find themselves confined in a bag @xcite , and the boundary conditions for achieving confinement hold the same . the relevant changes ( of couplings ) and fittings ( to the symmetry energy )",
    "are done otherwise for hadronic matter .",
    "the total energy density of the nuclear matter then reads @xmath31^{1/2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the isospin projection of baryon @xmath33 . for the nucleons we take @xmath34 .",
    "the corresponding coefficients for the hyperons will be discussed later . in the above expression for the energy density ,",
    "we have introduced the @xmath10 couplings .",
    "the chemical potentials , necessary to define the @xmath35-equilibrium conditions , are given by @xmath36    in the above expressions the mean fields for mesons are determined by the equations @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 , and @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    ".nuclear matter properties of the models used in the present work .",
    "all quantities are taken at saturation , where @xmath42=15.7 mev and the compressibility @xmath43 mev . @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the density and proton fraction at the crust - core transition estimated from the thermodynamical spinodal section . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have proposed a modified qmc model which includes a nonlinear @xmath9 coupling in the same fashion as it has been proposed for the nlmw @xcite . in qmc model",
    "the nucleons are described as non - overlapping bags .",
    "the extra contribution allows the softening of the symmetry energy at large densities . in nlwm or qmc without this term",
    "the symmetry energy increases almost linearly with the baryonic density giving rise to very hard stellar matter eos .",
    "the inclusion of this term remedies this problem and brings down the slope of the symmetry energy at saturation density to values closer to the experimental predictions ( see @xcite for a compilation of all constraints on @xmath46 ) . with the modified qmc , we may take advantage of the already known good properties of the qmc together with a symmetry energy that is not too hard .",
    "we have also shown that the behavior of the modified qmc model is closer to the properties of nuclear relativistic models with density dependent couplings such as tw , a relatvisitic nuclear model with density dependent coulings @xcite .",
    "namely , the crust - core transition density is larger than the one predicted by the standard qmc and similar to tw and the distillation effect in non homogeneous matter does not increase with density as in nl3 , but decreases as in tw .",
    "we have also discussed the effect of the new eos on the stellar properties .",
    "hyperons were included in the eos , and , for the hyperon couplings we took advantage of the fact that qmc predicts the hyperon effective masses without being necessary to fix the hyperon-@xmath3 couplings .",
    "we have used information from hypernuclei to fix the hyperon-@xmath7 coupling and the hyperon-@xmath8 coupling was considered equal to the one of the nucleon . since there is a large uncertainty on hypernuclei with @xmath47 and @xmath48 , we have also tested the effect of increasing the potential @xmath49 so that it becomes less attractive .",
    "it was shown that both the symmetry energy and the hyperon couplings have a strong effect on the mass and radius of the star .",
    "a softer symmetry energy gives rise to smaller stars .",
    "also the hyperon fraction is affected : softer symmetry energy corresponds to a smaller hyperon fraction as already discussed in @xcite .",
    "however , within qmc the density dependence of the symmetry energy has also an effect on the maximum star mass and this effect was not obtained in @xcite .",
    "it was also shown that the hyperon nuclear interaction defines the amount of strangeness in the star , and , therefore , has a strong influence on the maximum mass allowed . even including hyperons in the qmc eos we could explain the mass of the pulsar j1614 - 2230 if the cascade nuclear potential is set to be very little attractive .",
    "more data on hypernuclei is needed to constrain the hyperon - meson couplings .",
