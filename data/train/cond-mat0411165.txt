    "granular materials such as sand , grains and powders exhibit a variety of remarkable behaviors which , in the last decades , have been extensively through a number of experiments , computer simulations and analytical techniques  @xcite .",
    "this paper aims to review the conceptual and technical difficulties encountered when the same statistical approach successfully applied to simple fluids is generalized and extended to study granular systems .",
    "the question whether the dynamics of a collection of inelastic particles is amenable to an hydrodynamical and even `` thermodynamical '' description is a longstanding and still controversial issue of the general theory of granular matter .    in 1995 ,",
    "du , li and kadanoff  @xcite proposed and studied a minimal model of a one - dimensional granular gas where @xmath0 hard rods , constrained to move on the segment @xmath1 $ ] , interact by instantaneous binary inelastic collisions with a restitution coefficient @xmath2 .",
    "a thermal wall of temperature @xmath3 , at the boundary @xmath4 , prevents the system from the cooling caused by inelasticity .",
    "when the leftmost particle bounces against the wall , it is reflected with a velocity drawn from a gaussian distribution with variance @xmath3 and transfers the energy to the rest of the system .",
    "the main finding of the authors was that even at very small dissipation @xmath5 , hydrodynamic equations failed to reproduce the essential features of simulations .",
    "simulations , indeed , showed that the system sets onto an `` extraordinary '' state with most of the particles moving slowly and very near the right wall , while most of the kinetic energy is concentrated in the leftmost particle . reducing the dissipativity @xmath6 at fixed @xmath0 ,",
    "the cluster near the wall becomes smaller and smaller .",
    "the authors also pointed out that a qualitative explanation of this clustering phenomena could be found in the boltzmann equation in the limit @xmath7 , @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",
    "we have reproduced the results of du et al . and found that the breakdown of hydrodynamic approach can be ascribed to the peculiarities of the model .",
    "first , the one - dimensional character represents generally an obstacle to the development of the hydrodynamic theory even for elastic systems since transport coefficients usually diverge with system size at low dimension . of course",
    "exceptions exist as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , where , under some particular circumstances , the hydrodynamics of a 1-d inelastic system has been worked out .",
    "second , this model lacks proper thermodynamic limit because when @xmath10 ( with @xmath11 ) , both the mean kinetic energy and the mean dissipated power reduce to zero .",
    "this is consistent with the scenario suggested by the authors in which energy equipartition is broken and the description of the system in terms of macroscopic smooth quantities no longer holds .",
    "the proposed mechanism of energy injection may become strongly inefficient because , even at moderate inelasicities , it may involve only just few particles near the thermal wall . in this condition ,",
    "thermodynamic observables such as mean kinetic energy or mean dissipated power are non - extensive quantities .",
    "third , the system has no proper elastic limit , indeed when the dissipation is removed by setting @xmath12 , the kinetic energy increases indefinitely due to the mechanical action of the wall that continuously injects energy into the system .",
    "the situations gets even worst upon reducing the energy injection to zero to take the elastic limit : elastic collisions simply exchange velocities and the initial velocity distribution does not evolve at all .    in the following , we present and study a class of models where the aforementioned `` pathologies '' are partly removed .",
    "the common feature of these models is the presence of a stochastic external driving which , acting statistically on each particle , destroys the anomalous configurations observed in ref .",
    "furthermore the action of a damping term guarantees the existence of a smooth elastic limit .",
    "we shall see that although such systems display a `` less pathologic '' bevaviour , the existence of an hydrodynamical interpretation is still critical and dubious because it is affected by general conceptual problems  @xcite .",
    "the same difficulties , on the other hand , are also encountered in the interpretation of experimental studies on forced granular systems .",
    "for instance , a well known experiment by jaeger et al .",
    "@xcite consider a container full of sand shaken from the bottom plate .",
    "when the shaking is very rapid , observations indicate that a few - grain thick boundary layer forms near the floor .",
    "particles inside this layer move very quickly with sudden changes in their dynamics . at the top of the container , instead , particles move ballistically undergoing very few collisions in their trajectory ( knudsen regime ) .",
    "both layers can not be described by hydrodynamics because the assumption of smooth variation of the velocity field is not satisfied .",
    "the same happens in molecular gases , however , for granular systems such boundary layers are macroscopic , and this seriously affects the prediction capability of hydrodynamic theories .",
    "furthermore , the lack of a neat scale separation between the mean free time and the vibration period makes any hydrodynamic approach practically meaningless . on the other hand , it is also intrinsically unable to describe the slow grain dynamics at slow tapping rates . in this case , indeed , the system reaches a sort of mechanical equilibrium characterized by an almost absence of motion  @xcite .",
    "such an equilibrium is reached at different densities which - as the tapping goes on - slowly change with `` history '' dependent evolutions .",
    "this memory effect can not be captured by the set of partial differential equations concerning ordinary hydrodynamics .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe a model of granular gas introduced to remove the `` pathologies '' affecting previous models , such as the lack of a well defined thermodynamic or elastic limit . in section iii and iv ,",
    "we discuss simulations on different models for driven granular gas with non homogeneous energy sources . in section v , we discuss the fundamental problem of scale separation which undermines the development of a general hydrodynamic theory for granular flows . after having summarized the main failures of thermodynamic and hydrodynamic approaches to granular systems , we present , in section vi , a numerical experiment where instead thermodynamic concepts positively apply . in section vii we finally draw some conclusions .",
    "in papers  @xcite some of us introduced a kinetic model to describe a granular gas kept in a stationary state under the effect of both a damping term and external stochastic forcing .",
    "this model aims to reproduce the experimental situations in which an inelastic system is forced by shearing , shaking , air fluidization , and so on .",
    "all these energy sources supply the system with an `` internal energy '' able to randomize the relative particle velocities .",
    "they basically act as a temperature source @xcite which favours the onset of steady regimes , but at the same time , introduce a systematic ( non random ) friction which can be modelled by an effective damping term in the particle dynamics .    the randomly driven granular gas defined in  @xcite consists of an assembly of @xmath0 identical hard objects ( spheres , disks or rods ) of mass @xmath13 and diameter @xmath14",
    ". we shall set @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( boltzmann s constant ) in the following and assume that grains move in a box of volume @xmath17 .",
    "the dynamics of the system is the outcome of three physical effects : friction with the surroundings , random accelerations due to external driving , inelastic collisions among the grains .",
    "the first two ingredients are modeled in the shape of kramers equations between two consecutive collisions @xmath18 parameters @xmath19 ( decorrelation time ) and @xmath3 ( temperature ) characterize the properties of the external bath .",
    "the function @xmath20 is the standard white noise : @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "this choice guarantees that einstein s relation @xcite is fulfilled in the elastic or collisionless regime .",
    "the inelastic collisions , instead , are considered at the kinetic level , because an impact instantaneously transform the velocities of the grains involved .",
    "when particles @xmath24 and @xmath25 collide , their velocities are instantaneously changed into new velocities according to the following collision rule : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the unit vector along the direction joining the centers of the particles , @xmath28 is called the normal restitution coefficient .",
    "these rules reduce the longitudinal component of the relative velocity for @xmath29 , which instead is only inverted at @xmath30 .",
    "this model has been studied in detail  @xcite through simulations using direct simulation monte carlo ( dsmc )  @xcite and molecular dynamics ( md ) algorithms @xcite as well .",
    "the first method treats collisions stochastically , assuming the hypothesis of molecular chaos between particles at a distance smaller than @xmath31 ( a parameter which is chosen to be smaller than mean free path ) .",
    "it can be regarded as a sort of spatially inhomogeneous monte carlo technique .",
    "the second method instead implements the dynamics of the model without any approximation requiring , however , much more computational resources .    in the dynamics of the @xmath0 particles defined by eqs .",
    "( [ langev1],[langev2 ] ) and ( [ collis1],[collis2 ] ) , the relevant parameters are : the coefficient of normal restitution @xmath28 , which determines the degree of inelasticity and the ratio @xmath32 of the forcing characteristic time ( bath ) to the `` global '' mean free time between consecutive collisions .",
    "on the basis of these two parameters , the dynamics of our model exhibits two fundamental regimes :    * a stationary `` collisionless '' regime occurring when @xmath33 . in this regime",
    "we expect that , after a transient time of order @xmath19 , the system reaches the stationary behaviour of independent brownian particles characterized by homogeneous density , maxwell velocity distributions and absence of correlations . *",
    "a stationary `` colliding '' regime obtained when @xmath34 .",
    "if collisions are inelastic , this condition corresponds to the _ cooling _",
    "limit , and for times larger than @xmath19 , the model evolves with anomalous statistical properties .",
    "numerical simulations show that the thermodynamic limit on this model is well defined , thus one of the problems affecting the du et al .",
    "system is solved .",
    "the dynamics in the colliding regime ( @xmath34 ) and in the presence of inelasticity ( @xmath2 ) , results in a stationary state with a temperature @xmath35 always lower than @xmath3 .",
    "the granular temperatures approaches monotonically @xmath3 as @xmath8 , so that the elastic limit can be safely taken without energy catastrophe .",
    "the fact that ( when @xmath2 and @xmath34 ) @xmath36 is the principal indication that a our model of granular gas is a genuine non equilibrium system in a statistically stationary state .",
    "this state is characterized by inhomogeneous spatial arrangement of grains ( clustering ) and non - gaussian velocity distributions .",
    "figure  [ h_density1 ] displays a snapshot , from 2d simulations , of the particle positions in a strong clustering regime .",
    "the inelastic regime exhibits much stronger density fluctuations than those occurring in the collisionless limit , @xmath37 , where , grains , instead , occupy the whole volume uniformly with no correlations .    in figure  [ h_density2 ] , we show the probability distribution of the `` cluster mass '' , @xmath13 , defined as the number of particles found in a box of volume @xmath38 .",
    "we divided the container of the system into @xmath39 identical boxes with an elementary volume @xmath38 .    in the collisionless regime ,",
    "the number of particles in a box of size @xmath38 follows a poisson - like distribution with average @xmath40 .",
    "on the contrary , the colliding regime ( @xmath41 ) generates very different density distributions which can be fitted by a power - law @xmath42 corrected by an exponential cut - off only due to finite size effects . in most of the simulations",
    ", we found @xmath43 and @xmath44 slightly greater than @xmath45 .",
    "the power law behaviour is the signature of self - similarity in the distribution of clusters occurring with no characteristic size .",
    "these anomalous density fluctuations are not an artifact produced by the simulation technique because they have been observed by using both dsmc and md algorithms .",
    "we have characterized the emergence of spatial correlations through the measure of the correlation dimension @xmath46 ( grassberger and procaccia  @xcite ) .",
    "the latter is defined by scaling behaviour @xmath47 of the cumulated particle - particle correlation function @xmath48 where the over - bar indicates the time averaging taken after the system reaches a steady regime , @xmath49 is the spatial resolution and @xmath50 is the unitary step function .    for homogeneous density ,",
    "@xmath46 coincides with the euclidean dimension @xmath51 , while the result @xmath52 is an indication of a _ fractal _ ( self - similar ) density .",
    "model simulations carried out in the collisionless regime lead always to homogeneous distributions of particle ( fig .",
    "[ h_c ] ) , while fractal densities often occur in inelastic colliding regimes ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the scenario provided by the mass distribution of clusters discussed above .",
    "another peculiarity of a driven granular gas is the behavior of the velocity distribution @xmath53 .",
    "typical @xmath53 for our model in 1-d and 2-d simulations are shown in figure  [ h_v ] .",
    "we see a strong difference between the collisionless ( or elastic ) regime , @xmath54 and the inelastic colliding regime @xmath55 .",
    "the collisionless regime is characterized by a gaussian @xmath53 while , in the colliding regime , a non - gaussian behavior appears as an enhancement of high - energy tails and the fitting procedure of such tails provides the direct evaluation of the deviation from the gaussian regime . in our simulations",
    ", we found the evidence for @xmath56 tails , in agreement with the theoretical prediction by ernst and van noije  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , we see from the right panel of figure  [ h_v ] , that our model in the regime @xmath57 , is able to reproduce also the exponential tails @xmath58 expected by the theory of ref .",
    "@xcite for `` homogeneous cooling states '' .",
    "however it is worth noticing that the result was derived with the assumption of spatial homogeneity , condition violated by our simulations when the system undergoes clustering .    to our knowledge",
    ", experimental measurements of velocity distributions have been performed only recently and noticeably only for steady state granular systems under some sort of energy injection .",
    "we recall some of the used laboratory setups where non - gaussian distribution have been observed :    a : :    vibration of the bottom of a 3d granular system ( losert et    al .",
    "@xcite ) b : :    vertical vibration of an horizontal plate with a granular mono - layer    on the top of it ( olafsen and urbach  @xcite ) c : :    vibration of the bottom side of an inclined plane with a very dilute    granular mono - layer rolling on it , under the presence of gravity    ( kudrolli and henry  @xcite ) d : :    vibration of the bottom of a granular system confined in a vertical    plane ( rouyer and menon  @xcite )    one of the arguments given by goldhirsch  @xcite to explain the existence of a general clustering instability starts from an heuristic estimate of the local temperature ( granular temperature @xmath35 ) as a function of particle density @xmath59 and local shear rate @xmath60 @xmath61 is the particle mean free path .",
    "the above relationship remains meaningful at time scales shorter than the decay time of the shear rate .",
    "thus the local scalar pressure is supposed to decrease at larger densities @xmath62 implying an instability , because a positive fluctuation in the number of particles , in a given region , causes a reduction in the local pressure which attracts many other particles under the effect of pressure gradient . however , formula  ( [ eq : tg_vs_n ] ) strictly holds in the cooling regime and does not apply to our driven system for which the relation between local temperature @xmath35 and local density is very different .",
    "simulations , in fact , indicate that the mean square velocity @xmath63 , in the @xmath64-th box , as a function of the number of grains @xmath65 in that box exhibits a more general power - law behavior ( the total volume has been divided in @xmath39 identical boxes ) .",
    "as expected , in the clustering regime , the distribution of the number of particles in a box ( cluster masses ) presents a power - law decay with an exponential cut - off .",
    "this induces also a non trivial power - law behavior in the relation @xmath63 versus @xmath65 as reported in figure  [ h_t ] ,    where we see that in the collisionless ( or elastic ) regime the local temperature remains nearly constant so does not depend upon the cluster mass @xmath13 . in the inelastic condition , instead , the local temperature appears to be a power of the cluster mass , @xmath66 with @xmath67 .",
    "this relation ensures that the `` clustering catastrophe '' ( particles falling in an inverted pressure region ) can not occur because the scalar pressure @xmath68 increases with the density since @xmath69 is a positive exponent .",
    "moreover , by using the previous result on the fractal correlation dimension @xmath46 ( eq .  ( [ correlation_function ] ) ) , we can give an estimate of the length - scale dependence of the temperature .",
    "in fact , if we assume that the scaling relation for the temperature is valid at different spatial scales , we can replace the _ density _ to the _ number of particles _ in the expression for @xmath35 , i.e. @xmath70 . since the local density is expected to follow the scaling @xmath71 , the local temperature follows the law @xmath72 and accordingly the local pressure behaves like @xmath73 . in conclusion , the density and the pressure both decrease with the length scale @xmath49 , while the temperature increases .",
    "this scale dependence of the macroscopic fields is evidently at odds with the possibility of separating mesoscopic from microscopic scales and therefore the hydrodynamical description can not be attempted .",
    "the inability of granular temperature to play the same role of kinetic temperature in equilibrium statistical physics ( for example being equal to the temperature of the thermostat in the stationary asymptotic regime ) is further demonstrated by models of granular mixtures  @xcite .",
    "two granular materials , fluidized by the same kind of homogeneous random driving mechanism , show up different kinetic temperatures in agreement with experiments  @xcite .",
    "however , in the last section of this article , we discuss a toy model where granular temperature recovers a role similar to `` thermal temperature '' making the situation even more complex .",
    "recent experiments  @xcite have investigated the effect of gravity on driven granular materials . gravity , as a uniform force field , has no consequences on relative velocities and thus on the sequence of collisions .",
    "it simply accelerates the center of mass of a granular gas and its action becomes relevant only when studied in the presence of particular boundary conditions that break the galilean invariance ( horizontal planes or plates ) .",
    "a plate has an important role in disordering the velocity distributions especially when it vibrates in the presence of gravity which , driving the grains toward the horizontal plates , makes the randomization process even much efficient .",
    "the left frame of figure  [ i_sketch ] sketches the geometry setup of an experiment conducted in ref .",
    "@xcite consisting of a plane of size @xmath74 inclined by an angle @xmath75 with respect to the horizontal .",
    "the top and the bottom wall confine particles to move in such a plane under the action of an effective gravitational force @xmath76 . in our simulations , we reproduced the geometry and applied periodic boundary conditions in the horizontal direction .",
    "we assumed that both the top and the bottom walls of the plane are inelastic with a restitution coefficient @xmath77 .",
    "the transfer of energy and momentum into the system is realized , in our modeling through either sinusoidal or stochastic ( thermal ) vertical vibrations of the bottom wall . in the first case a particle bouncing onto this wall is reflected with a vertical velocity component : @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the vibration velocity of the wall . in the second case , a particle , after the collision against the wall",
    ", acquires randomly new velocity components @xmath80 and @xmath81 with probability distributions @xmath82 and @xmath83 respectively , where @xmath84 is the mean energy supplied by the wall to the gas in a period of oscillation .    for moderate vibration intensities , the model sets onto an highly fluidized stationary phase which resembles turbulence .",
    "the time evolution of density and velocity fields exhibits an intermittent - like behavior characterized by rapid and large fluctuations , sudden explosions ( bubbles ) followed by the formation of large particle clusters traveling coherently downward under the action of gravity .    in figure  [ i1_t ]",
    ", we report the steady temperature profile @xmath85 for our system as obtained from simulations ; a minimum of @xmath85 is clearly visible near y=0 , position of the bottom wall .",
    "the parametric plot of granular temperature @xmath35 versus the particle density @xmath59 determines a power law @xmath86 which closely recalls the algebraic tails already observed in the behaviour of the randomly driven model ( sec . [",
    "sec : driven ] ) .    as before",
    ", the particle - particle correlation function is the useful indicator to quantify the degree of spatial arrangement in the system . in this case , the suitable quantity to measure is the particle - particle correlation function @xmath87 conditioned to the height @xmath88 , i.e. computed over the horizontal slab @xmath89\\times [ 0,l_x]$ ] .",
    "data collected during simulations show a power law behavior @xmath90 ( fig .",
    "[ i1_c ] ) .",
    "again for homogeneous densities , @xmath46 is expected to coincide with the topological dimension of the box @xmath91 , so we obtained @xmath92 for all the resolution @xmath93 at which the box appears as a `` unidimensional '' stripe . while we found @xmath94 , at resolutions @xmath95 , because the slab appears as two - dimensional object .    when the regime of inelastic collisions is switched on ,",
    "clustering processes , characterized by values of @xmath46 lower than the topological dimension , appear in some of the analyzed stripes , as clearly seen by the three slopes of the log - log plot of fig .",
    "these three power - laws refers to three slabs at different heights ( labelled by @xmath96 @xmath97 and @xmath98 ) and very different density conditions marked by the arrows in the inset showing the density profile . when the density is not too high , the fit performed in the region @xmath99 yields always an exponent smaller than @xmath100 .    in the left frame of fig .",
    "[ i1_v ] , instead we report the typical distributions of horizontal velocities for particles belonging to stripes at different levels ( densities ) above the bottom wall ( @xmath101 in the inset ) .",
    "axes variables are properly rescaled to obtain a data collapse . again",
    ", the distributions appear to be non - gaussian and their broadening , namely the granular temperature @xmath85 , is height dependent .",
    "the same behavior can be observed for both periodic or stochastic vibrations . the right frame of fig .",
    "[ i1_v ] indicates that the distribution of horizontal velocities becomes more and more gaussian when the angle of inclination is risen .",
    "this trend toward a gaussian behaviour , in perfect agreement with experimental observations @xcite , is a consequence of a large inclination , which , enhancing the collision rate against the wall , favours the `` randomization '' of velocities .",
    "according to the analogy between vibrating walls and heating baths , this scenario is consistent with that observed for the randomly driven model where larger `` heating rates '' ( decrease in @xmath32 ) determine a transition from non - gaussian to gaussian regime .",
    "in the context of non homogeneous driven granular gases , we analyzed a second more interesting model  @xcite whose geometry is sketched in right frame of figure  [ i_sketch ] . the `` set - up '' consists of a two dimensional channel of depth @xmath102 and length @xmath103 , vertically confined by a bottom and a top inelastic wall , periodic boundary conditions are applied in the direction parallel to the flow .",
    "the channel is tilted up by an angle @xmath104 with respect to the horizontal line , so gravity has both components @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "this model mimics the experiment performed by azanza _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , where a stationary flow in a two - dimensional inclined channel was observed at a point far from the source of the granular material .",
    "the assumption of periodic boundary conditions in the flow direction is consistent with the observed stationary regime reached upon the balance between gravity drift and damping effect due to inelastic collisions .",
    "simulated density , velocity and temperature profiles well reproduce those measured in experiments  @xcite .",
    "they , indeed , show the existence of a critical height , @xmath107 , corresponding to the separation between two different dynamical regimes .",
    "below @xmath108 , profiles look almost linear especially the density and velocity ones , while above @xmath108 profiles rapidly change and become nearly constant .",
    "these changes in the behavior can be explained by the fact that below @xmath108 , transport is mainly dominated by collisional exchange , while above @xmath108 it is mainly associated to ballistic flights .",
    "again , our discussion focuses on the density correlations @xmath87 computed in stripes at different density ( figure  [ i2_c]-left ) . even in this system ,",
    "clustering effects show up and are quantified by a correlation dimension @xmath46 ranging from @xmath100 in homogeneous stripes to @xmath109 for highly clustered stripes .",
    "the distribution of horizontal velocities in slabs at different heights are plotted in the right frame of figure  [ i2_c ] .",
    "the emergence of non - gaussian behavior is clearly evident especially in the case with @xmath110 and mainly in the stripes near the bottom wall .",
    "classical rheological model proposed by jenkins and richman  @xcite invokes a quasi - gaussian equilibrium to calculate the transport coefficients .",
    "the results of our simulations , however suggest , that near the bottom wall , the gaussian approximation seems a very poor description of the real distribution .",
    "this is not only a consequence of inelasticity but also an effect of the proximity to the boundary , where high spatial gradients can easily bring the gas out of equilibrium .",
    "more recent derivations of hydrodynamic equations  @xcite use a boltzmann - like approach for inelastic gases which yields non - gaussian velocity distributions : these theories pose on a more solid basis and provide much more reliable estimations of transport coefficients .",
    "the reliability of hydrodynamics in the description of fluidized granular gases has been intensively probed through simulations and experiments suggesting , in some cases , a certain range of validity which surprisingly extends to very inelastic regimes . however , even in these lucky situations , the success is somehow lacking a rigorous foundation and addresses the question `` why hydrodynamics works ? '' .",
    "goldhirsch  @xcite for instance pointed out that `` the notion of a hydrodynamic , or macroscopic description of granular materials is based on unsafe grounds and it requires further study '' .",
    "he argued that one of the main obstacle lies on the absence of a sharp distinction between the spatio - temporal scales of the microscopic dynamics and the relevant macroscopic scales .",
    "the aim of this section is to briefly review his arguments on this fundamental issue .",
    "we remind that the validity of hydrodynamics and its correct derivation is still a subject of debate as recent discussions testify  @xcite .",
    "a standard granular experiment involves about @xmath111 grains and a container with a linear size of few orders of magnitude larger than the typical size of grains .",
    "therefore the possibility to identify an intermediate scale separating microscopic kinetics from macroscopic hydrodynamics is rather doubtful .",
    "the lack of scale separation is not only a mere experimental limitation because in principle one can imagine experiments involving an avogadro s number of grains and very large containers .",
    "instead it is of conceptual nature and not only related to granular materials but also to molecular gases when subject to large shear rates or large thermal gradients .",
    "in general when velocity or the temperature fields vary significantly over a length of a mean free path , no scale distinction occurs between microscopic and macroscopic scales , accordingly the gas should be considered mesoscopic . in granular gases ,",
    "this kind of _ mesoscopicity _ is generic and not limited to the presence of strong forcing .",
    "moreover , phenomena like clustering , collapse and avalanches typical of granular dynamics strongly violate the _ molecular chaos _ condition required by the boltzmann s approach . in mesoscopic systems ,",
    "fluctuations are expected to be larger by consequence the ensemble averages of observables need not to be representative of their typical values . furthermore in systems without a true scale separation , like turbulent fluids or systems undergoing a second - order phase transition , one expects that the constitutive relations relating fluxes to densities are scale dependent .",
    "the quantitative demonstration of the intrinsic mesoscopic nature of granular gases stems from the equation @xmath112",
    "@xcite , relating the local granular temperature @xmath35 to the local shear rate @xmath113 and to the mean free path @xmath61 .",
    "the above relation holds until @xmath113 can be considered a slow varying ( decaying ) quantity with respect to much more rapid damping rates of the temperature fluctuations .",
    "then , the ratio between the variation of the macroscopic velocity @xmath114 due to the shear and the thermal speed @xmath115 is proportional to @xmath116 .",
    "a part from very low values of @xmath117 , the shear rate is always large thus the chapman - enskog expansion leading to the hydrodynamic theory for the system should be generally carried out beyond the navier - stokes order .",
    "the above consideration is a direct consequence of the supersonic nature of granular gases  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that a collision between two particles moving in the same direction reduces their relative velocity but not the sum of their momenta . in a number of such collisions",
    ", the velocity fluctuations may become very small with respect to @xmath114 .",
    "we have to say that even the notion of mean free path may become useless in a shear experiment because the mean square particle velocity is given by @xmath118 ( @xmath88 being the direction of the shear ) .",
    "when @xmath119 the distance covered by a particle in the mean free time @xmath120 is @xmath121 that may become much larger than the `` equilibrium '' mean free path @xmath61 and even greater than the system size in the streamwise direction .",
    "the ratio between the mean free time @xmath122 and the macroscopic characteristic time of the problem @xmath123 , reads again proportional to @xmath116 .",
    "therefore a sharp separation between microscopic and macroscopic time scales rigorously occurs only when @xmath8 independently of system and grain sizes .",
    "two serious problems thus arise : a ) the fast local equilibration allowing to use equilibrium distributions as zeroth order approximations is not obvious ; b ) the stability studies based on the linearization of hydrodynamic equations become meaningless since they predicts instabilities on time scales which hydrodynamics is not supposed to resolve .",
    "goldhirsch  @xcite has also shown that the absence of a neat distinction in space / time scales implies a scale dependence of fields and fluxes , in particular the pressure tensor depends on the coarse graining resolution used to take local averages .",
    "this is similar to what happens , for example , in turbulence , where the `` eddy viscosity '' is scale dependent . pursuing this analogy ,",
    "goldhirsch has noted that an intermittent behavior can be observed in the time series of experimental and numerical measures of the pressure tensor .",
    "single collisions , which are usually averaged out in molecular systems , appear instead in granular systems as `` intermittent events '' affecting the time behaviour of relevant observables .",
    "so far , through the review of some models of inelastic gases , we have given evidences for the non - thermodynamics nature of the parameter @xmath35 called `` granular temperature '' .",
    "we have indeed shown that , @xmath35 is usually different from the thermostat temperature , it can be very inhomogeneous even in homogeneously driven systems and may strongly depend upon the scale of observation .",
    "finally we have mentioned the fact that in granular mixtures , @xmath35 does not govern the energy balance . in this section",
    "we want to show that @xmath35 still maintains the role of parameter controlling the characteristic times of the granular dynamics . here",
    "we discuss a simple toy model in which the main ingredient of granular gases , the inelasticity , is at work , but the dynamics is characterized by a time - scale determined by the granular temperature through an arrhenius - like formula  @xcite .",
    "the model consists of two inelastic hard rods ( the simplest granular gas ) constrained to move on a line under the effect of a bistable external potential @xmath124 .",
    "the system is coupled to a bath which exerts upon particles a velocity - dependent friction and a random force . in the absence of collisions ,",
    "the particles evolve according to : @xmath125 where , prime indicates the spatial derivative , @xmath126 ( @xmath127 represents the position of particles , @xmath113 is a friction coefficient and @xmath128 is the stochastic driving with variance @xmath129 .",
    "the basic phenomenology of the model is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig_xrel ] .",
    "the relative particle distance , @xmath130 , fluctuates in time showing time intervals of average lifetime @xmath131 , when particles are confined to the same well ( @xmath132 ) alternated with intervals , of average lifetime @xmath133 , when particle sojourn in separate wells .     as a function of time for a system with @xmath134 and @xmath135",
    "the solid line indicates the diameter of the rods @xmath136 , while the dashed marks the well separation @xmath137 , ( for potential parameters @xmath138 and @xmath139).,width=226 ]    [ fig_xrel ]    the dynamics is dominated by two competing effects , the dissipation in the collisions and the excluded volume .",
    "the first brings the particles together in the same well ( clustering ) while the other favors their staying apart in different wells .",
    "this two opposite effects are responsible for the existence of @xmath133 and @xmath131 as different time scales .",
    "figure  [ fig_tempi ] shows that @xmath131 and @xmath133 follow an arrhenius behavior with a suitable parameter renormalization with respect to the independent particle problem : @xmath140,\\ ] ] where @xmath141 indicates single or double occupation of a well , @xmath142 ( @xmath143 being the energy barrier between the wells ) and @xmath144 .",
    "the correction @xmath145 to the energy barrier @xmath143 amounts to @xmath146 and takes into account the effect of the excluded volume repulsion .",
    "when two grains belong to the same well their center of mass lies higher than if they were in separate wells , then then each grain experiences a lower ( effective ) energy barrier .",
    "this is a typical correlation effect , because the repulsion makes less likely the double occupancy of a well , with respect to the non interacting case . the smaller the ratio of the well width to the particle diameter , the stronger the reduction of the escape time  @xcite .    .",
    "open symbols refer to elastic case : the escape time is @xmath133 ( circles ) when a well is singly occupied , @xmath131 ( squares ) when a well is doubly occupied .",
    "full symbols , instead , correspond to the inelastic system ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "linear behavior indicates the validity of kramers theory with renormalized parameters and the slopes agree with values obtained from eq .",

    "inset : enlargement of the crossover region where @xmath131 becomes smaller that @xmath131 .",
    "the arguments of the exponentials ( dashed lines ) in the same figure have been obtained by formula  ( [ newkramer]).,width=226 ]    in figure  [ fig_tempi ] and related inset , the reader can see that the plots of @xmath133 and @xmath131 of the inelastic system ( dark symbols ) , intersect at a certain temperature @xmath147 . below @xmath148 the time @xmath131 becomes smaller than @xmath133 .",
    "the origin of this crossover lies on the fact that , in the inelastic system , temperatures @xmath149 and @xmath150 are no longer equal to @xmath3 and furthermore @xmath151 .",
    "thus , the mean lifetime of the clustering regimes can be still described by expression  ( [ newkramer ] ) , but now the granular effect competes with the excluded volume correction , eventually leading to @xmath152 .",
    "a simple argument can be used to estimate the shift of @xmath149 from @xmath3 . for moderate driving intensity",
    ", @xmath150 is nearly equal to @xmath3 , while @xmath149 is lower than @xmath3 by a factor which depends on the inelasticity .",
    "simulations show that @xmath149 varies linearly with @xmath3 and its slope is a decreasing function of the inelasticity @xmath153 . a good estimate of temperature @xmath149 can be obtained by an energy balance argument when the two particles belong to the same well regarded as an harmonic well @xmath154 .",
    "the average power per particle satisfies the balance equation @xmath155 where , @xmath156 stems from the competition between the viscous damping ( @xmath157 ) and the power supplied by the stochastic driving ( @xmath158 ) . while the last term in r.h.s of eq . estimates the mean power dissipated in each collision , @xmath159 being the typical collision time . from the rule applied in 1-d , we have @xmath160 . at stationarity",
    ", we expect that @xmath161 , thus @xmath162 assuming that the precollisional velocities @xmath163 and @xmath164 are nearly independent we can approximate @xmath165 .",
    "the collision time @xmath159 , instead , is estimated through the oscillation frequency in the harmonic well @xmath166 where the factor @xmath167 stems from the excluded volume effect .",
    "finally , we write the formula @xmath168 for the granular temperature , with @xmath169 .",
    "the knowledge of @xmath149 and @xmath143 characterizes the jump dynamics of the system across the energy barrier even when the it is inelastic .",
    "numerical simulations of eqs .",
    "verify very well the relation  .",
    "this simple example demonstrates that the granular temperature , even if can not control the `` equilibrium '' behavior of a granular gas , fairly determines the typical dynamical times scales of the system .",
    "we have summarized the main lines of a research carried out during the last years on granular gases .",
    "this paper focuses on the theoretical basis of a fluid - like description of granular systems under strong external forcing . in experiments",
    ", the behavior of a granular gas strongly resembles that of a fluid .",
    "however it is never at thermal equilibrium and , even though a kinetic temperature can be defined and measured , it has not the same role of equilibrium temperature .",
    "moreover many conceptual concerns , such as the absence of space and time scale separation , suggest that hydrodynamics is well posed only in a limited range of parameters .",
    "we have introduced a family of models of granular gases under external forcing to investigate these issues .",
    "such models , addressing different physical situations , present common features : strong correlated density fluctuations ( clustering ) , non - gaussian behavior of velocity distributions with heavy tails , and lack of energy equipartition or thermalization .",
    "the first model , an inelastic gas under external stochastic driving , is of course the simplest and most idealized , but it displays straightforwardly all these feature demonstrating that the main ingredient leading to such anomalous behaviors is simply the inelasticity .",
    "however the situation is not so hopeless : kinetic theories ( used to build hydrodynamics ) work in the neighborhood of elastic limit , when all the above problems appear in a mild form .",
    "more surprisingly , there are cases where some predictions of usual statistical mechanics and thermodynamics are reliable also in strong inelastic conditions .",
    "we brought , as an example , the dynamics of a couple of granular particles in a double well potential which can be again characterized by an arrhenius behaviour provided the environment temperature is replaced by the granular temperature . furthermore , some of us  @xcite have also showed that green - kubo relations for response to linear perturbation are still valid , again substituting granular temperature to external bath temperature ( there have been several attempts to derive green - kubo relations for granular gases , see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "both these results are quite intriguing because appear to be valid in strongly out - of - equilibrium regimes .",
