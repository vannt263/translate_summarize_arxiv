    "the program of the @xmath0 experiment is wide and ambitious , and covers several areas of interest in nuclear and particle physics@xcite .",
    "we plan to study with accuracy the mechanism responsible for phenomena like the quark confinement , through the investigation of :    * hadron spectroscopy : + @xmath2 search for gluonic excitations ; + @xmath2 charmonium spectroscopy ; + @xmath2 d meson spectroscopy ; + @xmath2 baryon spectroscopy ; + @xmath2 qcd dynamics .",

    "potential models agree also with the observation of several @xmath39 states , up to the discovery of the @xmath40(2317 ) .",
    "but they can not explain why the @xmath34 mass was observed more than 100 mev / c@xmath41 below the predictions .",
    "this is an even more complicated issue , as @xmath39 mesons are composed by the quarks @xmath36 and @xmath35 ( see fig .  [ fig3-panda ] ) .",

    "the experiment lhcb@xcite improved the knowledge of the @xmath39 spectrum , and confirmed the previous measurements , with the highest world precision ; but it can not provide the measurement of the width of these very narrow states , so the nature of the @xmath39 excited states still remain unclear . with the fine mass scan techniques",

    "track finder and fitting procedures in the central spectrometer use the kalman filter method ; wherever the @xmath19 field is not homogeneous , the runge kutta track representation is used . in order to have better mass resolution and higher reconstruction efficiency , the missing mass of the event is exploited : the reconstruction of the @xmath61 is performed , then we extract information on the @xmath34 by evaluating its four - momentum as the difference between the reconstructed @xmath61 four - momentum and the initial state vector . with this technique ,",

    "the @xmath34 in the process mentioned above is @xmath67=8.8 mev / c .",

    "in 2003 a new era started not only for the charm , but also for the charmonium sector : the discovery of the x(3872)@xcite and its subsequent confirmation by several experiments ( at @xmath69 colliders and @xmath70 interaction machines ) and in several decay modes .",
    "these observations set up the starting point to look after new forms of aggregation of matter : tetraquarks , molecular states , hybrids , etc.@xcite .",
    "these states were predicted by theory even before the discovery of the x(3872 ) , but in the last decade a plenty of theoretical papers provided new interpretations and new models , that have spurred refreshed interest in spectroscopy .",
    "several new observations and controversial interpretations of the evidence of additional new resonant states suggest that limitations due to statistics and resolution do not allow a unique interpretation , and discriminate among theoretical models .",
    "we use to name as generically x , y , z these new experimental findings , which do not fit in the spectra forseen by potential models , as in some cases it has been difficult to assign the quantum numbers .",
    "lots of progresses have been made by lhcb ; we know that the x(3872 ) is an isospin violating and very narrow state ; its quantum numbers have been found to be 1@xmath71@xcite , and no charged partners are found so far . clearly the interpretation of the x(3872 ) as charmonium state is unlikely , and alternative models have to be used to understand its nature . as for the case of the @xmath40(2317 ) , the measurement of the width plays an important role .",
    "@xmath0 will scan the x(3872 ) mass in 100 kev steps . in fig .",
    "[ fig5-panda ] ( left ) the simulated x(3872 ) signal is shown , together with a realistic background ; the latter is obtained using dpm@xcite mc generator , while the signal events are simulated by evtgen within the @xmath32 framework : we could reproduce precisely the input values of this simulation in the fit of fig .",
    "[ fig5-panda ] .",
    "a detailed description of this work is provided in @xcite .",
    "the measurement of the x(3872 ) width is just an example of the original measurements that @xmath0 will be able to perform in the charmonium sector .",
    "one of the challenges of @xmath0 , for instance , will be to explore and understand the confinement of quarks . a way to do that is to verify and test the behaviour of the potential in the intermediate and high energy regime with heavy hadrons , e.g. those composed particles whose mass is above the @xmath72 threshold , since below it",
    "the behaviour of the hadrons is generally well predicted from the potential models .",
    "a chance to test the confinement is , for example , to search for a @xmath73 state@xcite .",
    "if this state is found , it could be the proof that the linear term of the potential , in the formula @xmath74 , is indeed logarithmic , and not linear as it is believed .",
    "in fact , we could consider that the charmonium splitting is roughly the same as for bottomonium states ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6-panda ] ) .",
    "this can be explained assuming that the potential , at high energy , is logarithmic@xcite . the search for a high spin particle such as @xmath75 is also forbidden at b factories ( the past babar and belle , or the future belle ii ) , and it is forbidden at bes iii . but @xmath0 will have easy access to high spin states in formation , with excellent high production rates . in fig .  [ fig5-panda ] preliminary full mc simulations with @xmath32 are performed , to search for two of these states to test the charmonium splitting hypothesis .",
    "a last study illustrated in this report is the simulation of several unpredicted vector resonant states above the @xmath72 threshold , with large width and with established quantum numbers ( 1@xmath76 ) , whose nature is still unclear .",
    "fig  [ fig7-panda ] shows a @xmath32 full simulations for six of them : the vll photos@xcite model is used .",
    "we know that the bf of the @xmath77 is @xmath626@xmath23 , and that is the narrow charmonium ground state ; but the bf of the y - family states decaying to @xmath69 is of order of 10@xmath29 .",
    "this could be explained assuming that the radial quantum number @xmath78 for those y - states is larger than 1 , fact that supports the idea that they are non - conventional charmonia .",
    "however , only few of these vector states seem to decay to @xmath69 . for example , no measurement exists of bf(@xmath79 ) .",
    "this could be due to the statistics limitation at b factories , or because the vector state @xmath80 is not a charmonium state , as in this case it would decay to @xmath69 .",
    "there are arguments in favor of the @xmath80 as hybrid ; but its nature is not fixed , yet .",
    "it is worth in any case to look for the decay of all these vector states to @xmath69 .",
    "simulations in @xmath0 are very promising in this sense , as the reconstruction efficiency is evaluated to be @xmath6270@xmath23 for each state decaying to @xmath69 , and the background simulations by dpm show that background rejection is easy when the center of mass energy of @xmath81 is larger that 4 gev .",
    "we expect roughly 16 000 events / day in the high luminosity mode : this is an incredible high rate compared to what was measured in the past experiments .",
    "in addition , we could also study interference effects among all these large vector states , which overlap in a narrow energy range : this study was never performed before .",
    "the standard model is solid , but it does not give answers to all questions .",
    "several open issues still exist in the charm and charmonium physics sector , for example . the @xmath0 experiment at fair is designed to achieve a mass resolution 20 times better than attained at b factories , essential to perform fine mass scan ( every 100 kev ) .",
    "@xmath0 will have unprecedent pid power , indispensable for the measurement of the proton form factors and other measurements .",
    "+ in this report we highlighted the measurement of the width of some charm and charmonium states .",
    "this task is challenging but the measurement is absolutely needed to clarify and understand the nature of some observed states , such as the @xmath34 , @xmath42 and x(3872 ) . understanding the confinement is also a challenge :",
    "a new approach could be based on looking for high spin resonant states to test the potential models .",
    "@xmath0 offers a unique opportunity to perform these measurements with high precision .",
    "+ tdrs of several detectors have already been approved , and tests with detector prototypes are ongoing .",
    "the official @xmath32 simulation framework is at an advanced stage .",
    "important contributions are expected from @xmath0 when it will start to collect data ."
