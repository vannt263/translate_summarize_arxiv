    "this cloud mass - scale is about an order of magnitude less massive than that for the formation of the very first stars : @xmath9 where the characteristic density and temperature are set by the h@xmath0 cooling @xcite .",
    "because of the difference in the mass - scale of their natal clouds , the first- and second - generation primordial stars have been classified into different sub - populations : population iii.1 ( pop iii.1 ) and iii.2 ( pop iii.2 ) stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "until recently , the standard picture of primordial star formation postulated very massive ( a few @xmath10 ) pop iii.1 stars and less massive pop iii.2 stars ( a few @xmath11 ) .",

    "the stellar evolution then gives the stellar luminosity and effective temperature to the radiation hydrodynamics , which follows the interplay between the accretion flow and stellar radiation .",
    "as in h11 we calculate the dynamics of the accretion flow within 0.3  pc of the protostar . the initial gas distribution is configured with the simulation output of @xcite , who study the formation of a protostellar core in a relic hii region , performing three - dimensional ( 3d ) cosmological simulations .",
    "we reduce their 3d data at the moment when the central density reaches @xmath20 to 2d axisymmetric data by averaging over azimuthal angles .",
    "the original 3d data has some non - axisymmetric structure , but the deviation from the axial average is not large within the computational domain .",

    ", this part of the cloud is contained within 0.05  pc of the protostar . in comparison with the pop iii.1 case ( h11 ) , the density in the accreting envelope is lower , reflecting the lower temperature in the pre - stellar collapse stage . the grid resolution and boundary conditions are the same as in the fiducial case studied in h11 .",
    "immediately after the onset of the calculation , the stellar mass increases rapidly by accretion via a circumstellar disk .",
    "the density within the disk is high enough ( @xmath23 ) for the three - body reaction to convert most of the h atoms to h@xmath0 molecules .",
    "this molecular disk extends to @xmath24  au from the star when the stellar mass reaches @xmath25 . the mass accretion rate onto the protostar decreases with increasing stellar mass , e.g. , @xmath26 at @xmath27 , while @xmath28 at @xmath29 .",
    "these rates are about an order of magnitude lower than those in the pop iii.1 case , due to the lower density in the accreting envelope resulting from the lower gas temperature during the run - away collapse stage : for the collapse of a self - gravitating cloud , the accretion rate is given by @xmath30 , where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the sound speed and gas temperature in the accreting envelope @xcite . in the pop iii.2 case ,",
    "as described above , the gas temperature is lower than in the pop iii.1 case because of the efficient radiative cooling via extra h@xmath0 and hd molecules .",
    "figure  [ fig : mr_suv]-(a ) shows that , early on , the protostellar radius is @xmath33 and decreases slightly as the accretion rate decreases .",
    "the protostellar evolution can be understood by comparing the two timescales , namely the stellar kelvin - helmholtz ( kh ) timescale @xmath34 and the accretion timescale @xmath35 the former is the times over which the star radiates away its internal heat content , whereas the latter is the time over which the stellar mass doubles by accretion .",
    "initially , the kh timescale is much longer than the accretion timescale , i.e. , the star has no time to radiate its internal heat before its mass grows by accretion .",
    "this is the so - called adiabatic accretion stage ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since the stellar luminosity @xmath36 rises rapidly with increasing stellar mass , the kh timescale eventually falls below the accretion timescale at @xmath37 , where the stellar radius marks its maximum .",
    "after this the protostar loses its internal heat efficiently by radiative diffusion and contracts quasi - hydrostatically ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . during this kh contraction stage",
    "the stellar effective temperature @xmath38 varies as @xmath39 and h ionizing - photon ( @xmath40  ev ) luminosity therefore increases significantly ( fig .  [",
    "fig : mr_suv]-b ) .",
    "after the stellar mass exceeds @xmath41 , an hii region begins to develop , growing in the polar directions of the disk .",
    "figure  [ fig : snapshot]-(a ) shows the gas distribution in the vicinity of the protostar at @xmath42 .",
    "we see that the bipolar hii region is breaking out from the accreting envelope .",
    "h@xmath0 and hd",
    "molecules are completely photodissociated by stellar h@xmath0 dissociating ( @xmath43 ) photons except in the shadow of the disk . within the hii region",
    "the ionized gas flows outward at a velocity of several @xmath44  km / s .",
    "the high pressure in the hii region drives a strong d - type shock , which compresses and heats up the surrounding materials to @xmath45  k. the shocked gas has an outward velocity of several km / s .",
    "the hii region dynamically expands into the accretion envelope and its opening angle increases with protostellar mass ( fig .",
    "[ fig : snapshot]-b ) .",
    "the growth of stellar mass via accretion continues even after the formation and initial expansion of the hii region .",
    "however , the accretion rate is reduced by radiative feedback when compared to the no - feedback case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mr_xmdot ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the stellar uv radiation , the shock driven by the expanding hii region propagates around the disk and reaches the accreting envelope in the disk s shadow .",
    "the shocked gas flowing outward hinders accretion from the envelope onto the disk . the isolated disk exposed to the stellar",
    "uv radiation thins down via photoevaporation .",
    "accretion from the disk onto the star finally terminates at @xmath46 .",
    "this coincides with the moment when the protostar reaches the zero - age main - sequence stage ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mr_suv]-b ) .",
    "although the above overall evolution is qualitatively similar to that of pop iii.1 stars ( h11 ) , the resultant final stellar mass @xmath46 is lower than for the fiducial iii.1 case @xmath47 ( figure [ fig : mr_xmdot ] ) .",
    "this is mostly due to the fact that the protostellar evolution differs with the different accretion histories between the pop iii.1 and iii.2 cases ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mr_suv ] ) . at the lower accretion rate , in general",
    ", the kh timescale becomes comparable to the accretion timescale at a lower luminosity .",
    "the protostar thus begins to lose its internal energy and contracts at lower stellar mass ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the stellar ionizing luminosity significantly increases during the kh contraction stage .",
    "therefore , the uv feedback is effective at a lower stellar mass in the pop iii.2 case .",
    "although the mechanism of dynamical expansion of an hii region and subsequent photoevaporation of the disk , which ultimately shuts off the mass accretion , is common between the pop iii.1 and iii.2 cases , the required stellar ionizing luminosity for this mechanism to operate is much lower in the pop iii.2 case than for the pop iii.1 case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mr_suv]-b ) . this is because the hii region expands more easily through the lower - density pop iii.2 accretion envelope .",
    "the accompanying protostellar outflow and photoevaporation rates are also smaller than in the pop iii.1 case . in the pop iii.2 case , however , the weak uv stellar feedback is enough to shut off the slow mass accretion toward the protostar .",
    "in this _ letter _ , we have shown that radiative feedback limits the final mass of a `` typical '' pop iii.2 protostar to @xmath48 . with all the possible variations of initial conditions among different primordial gas clouds , we naturally expect that the resulting final stellar masses would have some distribution .",
    "cosmological simulations predict that , in the pop iii.1 case , the accretion rate onto a star could differ by more than two orders of magnitude among different star - forming clouds which form through various halo assembly histories ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "although such systematic studies have not been conducted for the pop iii.2 case , we expect a similar variance and hence some distribution of the final stellar masses . here",
    "we examine potential variances of the final stellar masses in our simulations .",
    "for instance , we use the @xmath49-viscosity formalism @xcite for mimicking the torque exerted by non - axisymmetric spiral arms formed in massive self - gravitating disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "recent 3d simulations show that the effective @xmath49-parameter is around @xmath50 in this case ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; we adopt an @xmath49-parameter in the mid - plane @xmath51 ( see h11 ) for the fiducial case discussed above .",
    "figure  [ fig : m_xmdot_a ] shows the accretion histories and resulting final stellar masses for different values of @xmath52 .",
    "analogously to h11 , the final stellar mass increases with the value of @xmath52 : @xmath53 for @xmath54 , whereas @xmath55 for @xmath56 .",
    "figure  [ fig : m_xmdot_a ] also shows the cases where the initial rotation of the natal cloud is reduced to 30% of the fiducial value . for this case",
    "the stellar uv feedback operates only after @xmath57 of the gas has accreted onto the star and the resulting final stellar mass is @xmath58 .",
    "although this mass range is systematically lower than that of pop iii.1 stars derived in h11 , the difference is within a factor of a few . in reality",
    ", the existence of photodissociating background radiation could further erase the difference in the final masses of pop iii.1 and iii.2 stars . recall that the lower masses of pop iii.2 stars originates from the enhanced abundances of h@xmath0 and hd , and the resultant more efficient cooling during the pre - stellar collapse of the natal cloud .",
    "however , the presence of even a weak photodissociating background ( @xmath59 ) inhibits the formation of h@xmath0 and hd molecules , thereby making the thermal evolution almost the same in the pop iii.1 case ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "if this is the case , the mass scale of pop iii.1 and iii.2 stars would be identical .",
    "although not considered in this study , gravitational fragmentation of the disk would also contribute to shape the mass distribution of primordial stars .",
    "for the pop iii.1 case , recent 3d numerical simulations show that the circumstellar disk easily becomes gravitationally unstable to fragmentation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , most of these studies consider the early evolution only , far before the mass accretion ceases and final stellar masses are determined .",
    "one can naively expect that disk fragmentation reduces the final stellar mass as the accreting material is shared by multiple protostars born from the fragments ( so - called  fragmentation - induced starvation ",
    ", e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the nature of mass accretion with disk fragmentation might be even more complex during later evolutionary phases .",
    "for instance , gravitational interactions between the multiple protostars could redistribute angular momentum . if angular momentum is carried away by a small number of ( proto-)stars thrown out of the system , accretion of the remaining gas onto the remaining star(s )",
    "could be enhanced . moreover ,",
    "merging of protostars in the disk is also possible .",
    "the net result is that mass accretion onto the star would be strongly time - dependent or even have the consequence of stochastic burst - like accretion events which potentially change the evolution of the protostars ( but see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . these effects should be examined in future long - term 3d simulations .",
    "if some of the low - mass stars born via the disk fragmentation survive without significant mass growth , they would be low - mass satellite - like stars orbiting around the massive stars whose final masses are limited by stellar radiative feedback .",
    "future work would explain how this effect differs between the pop iii.1 and iii.2 cases ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "as shown in @xcite , disk fragmentation is controlled by a balance between the mass transfer rates onto and through the disk .",
    "systematic difference in accretion rates onto the star - disk systems among the pop iii.1 and iii.2 cases would result in basic differences in the effects of disk fragmentation .",
    "our results provide a new picture that the typical mass of the primordial stars are tens of solar masses regardless of their generations .",
    "this explains why the signatures of pair - instability supernova , which is the final fate of @xmath60 stars , have not been seen in the abundance patterns of galactic metal - poor stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
