    "in the solar wind , pressure - balanced structures ( pbss ) , which show an inherent anti - correlation between the fluctuations of the magnetic pressure ( @xmath0 ) and the thermal pressure ( @xmath1 ) , have often been observed in the past decades and are considered as major ingredients of solar wind compressible turbulence ( see the review by @xcite and references therein ) . for observations near 1 au , @xcite examined the correlation between magnetic and thermal pressures and found that they are negatively correlated , indicating the existence of pbss . in the voyager data",
    ", @xcite identified that the pbss in the outer heliosphere increase with the heliocentric distance . using the helios data , @xcite and @xcite extensively studied the correlations between such quantities as density , temperature , and magnetic field magnitude .",
    "they found an anti - correlation between the magnetic pressure and the thermal pressure for fluctuations at scales less than one hour . on the basis of ulysses observations of the high - latitude solar wind",
    ", @xcite showed that at time scales of less than 1 day , pbss dominate the compressive component of the plasma turbulence of the high - latitude solar wind ( see also @xcite ) , and variations of the plasma @xmath2 within pbss appear to be positively correlated with the variations of the helium abundance . in high - resolution cluster data",
    ", @xcite found that pbss are possible on the scale of seconds .",
    "@xcite selected a segment of data obtained by the cluster c1 spacecraft in quiet solar wind , and found a dominant anti - correlation between the time series of the electron density and magnetic field strength , indicating the existence of multi - scale pbss , whose durations can last from 1 hr down to 10 s.    though pbss were frequently identified in the multi - scale fluctuations in the solar wind , their nature and origin have not yet been understood . in the inner heliosphere , the pbss progressively fade away with increasing heliocentric distance , which suggests that they may be of a solar origin as `` spaghetti - like '' magnetic flux tubes @xcite , while in the outer heliosphere the pbss build up increasingly , which means that they may also be generated in the solar wind , such as by slow - mode magnetosonic waves or mirror - mode instability @xcite , or by pick - up ions @xcite .",
    "@xcite used the data measured by the two helios spacecrafts to investigate properties of high - speed streams , and presented clear cases that the variability of the fluid parameters , which characterizes the fine - stream tubes , are due to spatial structures that may be viewed as remnants of the underlying coronal structures .",
    "@xcite further pointed out that these fine - stream structures are likely to be pressure - balanced structures .",
    "however , this solar - origin explanation is challenged by the recent observation of pbss with small scales of seconds , as their source region on the sun when being mapped out to the heliosphere would be too small to be observable . by analyzing the plasma and magnetic field data obtained by wind , @xcite investigated the dependence of the properties of small - scale pbss on the background magnetic field direction , and showed that the small - scale pbs may be related with highly oblique - propagating , slow - mode waves in the solar wind .",
    "based on the proton temperatures t@xmath3 and t@xmath4 , @xcite also gave another example where the small - scale pbs in the quiet solar wind may have been formed due to mirror - mode instability .",
    "the complete evidences of oblique / quasi - perpendicular propagating slow magnetosonic waves are provided by @xcite , in which not only the anti - correlation between @xmath5 and density is presented but also the phase relation between density and parallel velocity ( @xmath6 ) is investigated helping to diagnose the propagation direction with respect to the magnetic field vector .",
    "apart from these observational evidences , numerical simulations have been conducted to investigate the nature of the pbss and discontinuties @xcite . by comparing solar wind data from the advanced composition explorer ( ace ) with simulations of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence",
    ", @xcite examined the link between discontinuity identification and intermittency analysis , which supports that many or most of the intermittent solar wind structures are discontinuities which are expected to be produced in mhd turbulence .",
    "@xcite presented a two - dimensional model of solar wind turbulence in the dissipation range , and illustrated some signatures of small - scale pbss that are associated with very oblique slow - mode waves . in a simulation of the three - dimensional ( 3-d ) decaying compressive mhd turbulence ,",
    "@xcite examined how the rotational discontinuities are formed .",
    "they found that rotational discontinuities can evolve from the steepening of the alfvn wave with moderate amplitude , and this steepening is caused by the inhomogeneity of the alfvn speed in the ambient turbulence .",
    "however , these works have not reported multi - scale pbss , especially in the sense that the small - scale pbss are embedded in the larger ones . their possible formation in mhd turbulence has not been demonstrated .",
    "yet in the present work , based on a simulation of the driven compressible mhd turbulence , we identified frequent occurrences of multi - scale pbss , and could attribute their formation to oblique - propagating , slow - mode waves . in section 2 ,",
    "a general description of the numerical mhd model is given .",
    "section 3 describes the results of the numerical simulation and their analysis .",
    "section 4 is reserved for the summary and discussion .",
    "the plasma is described by a compressible 3-d mhd model , which involves fluctuating variables and a uniform large - scale field @xmath7 in the @xmath8direction .",
    "the equations are written in the following non - dimensional form :    @xmath9    @xmath10 = \\mathbf{f}_v \\ , \\ ] ]    @xmath11= \\nabla \\cdot ( \\mathbf{b } \\times \\eta \\mathbf{j}),\\ ] ]    @xmath12    where @xmath13 which correspond to the total energy density and current density , respectively . here",
    ", @xmath14 is the mass density ; @xmath15 is the flow velocity composed of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath8components ; @xmath18 is the thermal pressure ; @xmath19 denotes the magnetic field ; @xmath20 is time ; @xmath21 is the adiabatic index ; @xmath22 is the magnetic resistivity ; and @xmath23 as well as @xmath24 are the random large - scale drivers , and the distributions of @xmath23 in the @xmath25 plane at t = 0 is shown in figure [ figure1 ] .",
    "an example of the temporal behavior of @xmath23 at @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is presented in figure [ figure2 ] , and the amplitude of @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 at the high frequency is about 0.05 , which is far smaller than the magnetic(thermal ) pressure gradient at the grid size ( i.e. @xmath32 ) as shown in figure [ figure4 ] .",
    "therefore , the behaviors of @xmath23 and @xmath24 do not affect the generation of pbss directly without nonlinear cascading process .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]     to estimate the propagation speed of the chunk of the high density , the values of @xmath14 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath33 along the black dashed line in figure [ figure8 ] are extracted , and are stacked in time sequence .",
    "this gives the time - distance diagrams as displayed in figure [ figure9 ] , showing the recurrent stripes , whose slopes correspond to the propagating speeds , and are measure to be about @xmath34 . by averaging magnetic fields in the region associated with the chunk of the high density , it could be calculated that the angle between the mean magnetic field and the @xmath8direction is @xmath35 . with the use of the average values of thermal pressure and density , we could compute the local slow - mode wave speed along the propagation direction ( i.e. basically the z - direction ) as @xmath36}$ ] ( @xmath37 is sonic speed , and @xmath38 is alfvn speed ) , which is @xmath39 .    also , at both @xmath40 and @xmath41 , in this region , the velocity is small ( less than 0.5 ) , and its directions are diverse , giving a global velocity ( averaged over this chunk of the high density at either time point ) @xmath42 .",
    "considering that the magnetic pressure keeps being negatively correlated with the density as well as with the thermal pressure , it can be said that this chunk of the high density is probably associated with an obliquely propagating , slow - mode wave . at the same time , the magnetic pressure is well in balance with the thermal pressure for this wave , and the multi - scale pbs forms here .",
    "in this work , we used a higher order godunov code to simulate the generation of compressible turbulence in a plasma with an imposed uniform guide field , and to explore the formation of the multi - scale pbss in compressive mhd turbulence .",
    "the numerical simulation shows that in many regions the magnetic pressure is negatively correlated with the thermal pressure , and both @xmath0 and @xmath1 alter greatly , yet the total pressure @xmath33 only changes sightly . @xmath0 and @xmath1 exhibit a turbulent spectrum with a kolmogorov - like power law , although this spectrum applies here to compressible turbulence . in the inertial range ,",
    "the spectra of the magnetic pressure and the thermal pressure are close , and the amplitudes of @xmath0 and @xmath1 at various @xmath43 are nearly equal .    from the computed wavelet cross - coherence spectrum of the magnetic pressure and the thermal pressure",
    ", it is found that the anti - correlation between them extends over the whole range of covered scales . as the scale decreases ,",
    "the regions with sharp changes of @xmath0 and @xmath1 become small , and more pbss are generated .",
    "the simulated spatial series of the magnetic pressure and the thermal pressure on different scales also show that here exists a multi - scale anti - correlation of them , and that thus multi - scale pbss are generated , whereby the small pbss are embedded in the large ones .    by analysis of the nature of waves in the turbulence",
    ", it is found that the rms perturbation of the velocity corresponding to the fast magnetosonic waves is marginal compared with that of the slow magnetosonic waves as well as alfvn waves , and most of the compressive fluctuations behave as the slow - mode waves . also ,",
    "most of these slow magnetosonic waves reveal a highly oblique propagation . on the basis of the negative correlation between the magnetic pressure and the density , the negative correlation between the magnetic pressure and the thermal pressure , as well as the approximate equality between the inferred propagation speed and the predicted phase speed of the slow - mode wave , we present one single example that the multi - scale pbs is likely to be related with the highly oblique - propagating slow - mode waves .    in this study , we presented simulation data indicating that the multi - scale pbss could frequently appear in the compressible turbulence , and that their formation is likely associated with the oblique - propagating , slow - mode waves . in the simulated turbulence ,",
    "the slow magnetosonic wave amplitudes are seen to be much stronger than the fast magnetosonic wave amplitudes .",
    "this is comparable to the solar wind observation @xcite and earlier simulation @xcite .",
    "however , the slow magnetosonic wave amplitudes seem to be comparable to the alfvn wave amplitudes , which is unlike the typical solar - wind conditions that the amplitude in the compressive fluctuations is smaller than the amplitude in the non - compressive alfvnic fluctuations .",
    "this may be related to the nature of the non - pure alfvnic drivers @xmath23 and @xmath24 . in future",
    ", we may investigate the factors that control the generation and evolution of waves as well as their influences on the formation of the multi - scale pbss .",
    "another issue concerns the question why the slow - mode waves are highly oblique - propagating . as mentioned by @xcite , is it a result of the strong damping of the parallel - propagating slow - mode wave , or is it determined by the turbulent circumstances ?",
    "the potential nonlinear interaction between alfvn waves and slow magnetosonic waves , which has been inferred to be existent in the compressible solar wind turbulence and may be related with the observed signature of landau resonance heating @xcite , is another interesting topic worthy of further research .",
    "we may answer these questions in our subsequent works .",
