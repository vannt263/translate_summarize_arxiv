    "this is evidence against the presence of a massive , extended h envelope .",
    "from the available photometry we conclude that sn  2011dh is not a classical type iip sn , but further monitoring is necessary to definitely associate sn 2011dh with one of the other type ii subtypes ( iib , iil , 1987a - like ) .",
    "our inference of negligible host galaxy reddening from our study of the sed of the progenitor is supported by the non - detection of d , at the rest - wavelength of m51 , in high resolution spectra acquired as part of our monitoring campaign ( ergon et al .",

    "despite the canonical prediction that type ii sne arise from red supergiants , there is mounting evidence that some stars explode as yellow supergiants ( ysgs ) . a handful of type ii sne",

    ", in prep . ) and 2009kr @xcite .",
    "the locations of the progenitors on the hr diagram shows clearly that these stars are not located on the predicted end points for single star stellar evolution tracks .",
    "in addition , despite arising from supposedly similar ysg progenitors , these sne display a wide range of properties . while sn 1993j was a type iib sn ( with most of its h envelope stripped by mass transfer onto a binary companion ) , sn 2008cn was a bright type iip sn .",
    "@xcite present evidence that sn  2009kr is a type iil sn . while @xcite propose a type iib classification for sn  2011dh , its early photometric and spectroscopic properties ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sn ] ) are not identical to sn  1993j .",
    "the classification scheme for type ii sne ( iip @xmath60 iil @xmath60 iib ) may be interpreted as being due to increasing mass loss ( i.e. stripping of the h envelope ) from the progenitor .",
    "the effective temperatures derived for the ysg progenitors and the classification of the resulting sne shows this scheme is not correlated with observed @xmath61 of the progenitors ( fig .",
    "[ fig : obs : hrd ] ) .",
    "it is clear from our observations that the sed of the progenitor of sn  2011dh is consistent with a late - f supergiant .",
    "while possible combinations of two stars in a binary might also be employed to fit the sed , any improvement in the quality of the fit is mitigated by two key factors : 1 ) in introducing a binary companion , three additional parameters ( the temperature and gravity of the secondary and the ratio of the brightness of the two stars at a reference wavelength ) are introduced into the fit ; and 2 ) a companion star may not be contributing any measurable flux to observed sed , yielding a single star sed despite an underlying binary system . unlike the case of sn  1993j , we do not observe a uv excess associated with a possible companion onto which mass from the progenitor of sn  2011dh may have been transferred .",
    "we propose that any binary companion is below the detection limit of the pre - explosion observations .    the necessary binary parameters to produce such a ysg progenitor are also unclear .",
    "for example , the binary models of only produce progenitor stars with @xmath62 and in that extreme case the companion is of similar luminosity to the progenitor ( with @xmath63 ) that would produce significant uv excess not observed in these pre - explosion images .    despite the photometric and spectroscopic similarity to sn  2008ax",
    ", there are significant differences between the proposed progenitor scenarios for that sn @xcite and sn  2011dh .",
    "while @xcite concluded the photometry of the progenitor of sn  2008ax required either a single wr star or two stellar components , our observations of the progenitor of sn  2011dh are consistent with a single normal stellar component .    in isolation ,",
    "very massive stars @xmath64 can lose significant amounts of mass through stellar winds and eruptions ( e.g. as luminous blue variables ( lbv ) and wr stars ) .",
    "we have demonstrated , however , that the broad - band colors of the observed progenitor of sn  2011dh are inconsistent with those of wr stars . while some caution is required in the application of this analysis to all ysg progenitors of type ii sne ( e.g. the locus of the progenitor of sn  1993j , which was not a wr star @xcite , on fig .",
    "[ fig : obs : wr ] ) , that caution is not justified for the progenitor of sn  2011dh .",
    "as noted by @xcite for sn  2009kr , there is similarly no evidence for previous lbv eruptions of the progenitor , as we do not detect the signatures of eruptive mass loss such as : excess @xmath4 emission in the progenitor photometry or the spectroscopic signature of the sn interacting with a dense circumstellar medium ( fig .",
