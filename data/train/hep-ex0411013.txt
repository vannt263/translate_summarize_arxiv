    "around the center - of - mass energy of 3.770 gev , the @xmath7 resonance is produced in @xmath8 annihilation , and open charm pairs , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , are mainly produced in @xmath7 decays .",
    "so the measurement of the cross sections for @xmath0 and @xmath1 production at an energy point around 3.770 gev is very important in the understanding of @xmath7 decays .",
    "a coupled - channel model  @xcite predicts that the cross section for @xmath7 production is about @xmath9 and that the @xmath7 decay exclusively into @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "experimental results on the measurement of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath4 cross sections can be used to test the theoretical prediction .",
    "also the measured values of the cross sections can be used to determine the branching fraction for @xmath10 using the measured cross section for @xmath11 at the same energy point .",
    "the determination of the partial width of @xmath10 has great interest since it would be helpful for investigating the mixing between s and d waves in its wave function  @xcite , and in turn to help in developing the potential model  @xcite .",
    "in addition , by adding the tree level open charm cross section to an extrapolation of the tree level hadronic cross section for the light hadron production in the region below the open charm threshold , the total tree level hadronic cross section can be obtained  @xcite@xcite . the tree level cross section for inclusive hadronic event production in the @xmath8 annihilation at all energies is needed to calculate the effects of vacuum polarization on the parameters of the standard model .",
    "the largest uncertainty in this calculation arises from the uncertainties in the measured inclusive hadronic cross sections in the open charm threshold region .",
    "traditionally , the tree level hadronic cross sections are measured by counting inclusive hadronic events . using the measured cross sections for the @xmath5 production in the charm threshold region , we can also measure the tree level inclusive hadronic cross sections .",
    "bes - ii is a conventional cylindrical magnetic detector that is described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . a 12-layer vertex chamber ( vc ) surrounding the beryllium beam pipe",
    "provides input to the event trigger , as well as coordinate information . a forty - layer main drift chamber ( mdc ) located just outside",
    "the vc yields precise measurements of charged particle trajectories with a solid angle coverage of @xmath12 of @xmath13 ; it also provides ionization energy loss ( @xmath14 ) measurements which are used for particle identification .",
    "momentum resolution of @xmath15 ( @xmath16 in gev/@xmath17 ) and @xmath14 resolution of @xmath18 for bhabha scattering electrons are obtained for the data taken at @xmath19 gev .",
    "an array of 48 scintillation counters surrounding the mdc measures the time of flight ( tof ) of charged particles with a resolution of about 180 ps for electrons . outside the tof , a 12 radiation length , lead - gas barrel shower counter ( bsc )",
    ", operating in limited streamer mode , measures the energies of electrons and photons over @xmath20 of the total solid angle with an energy resolution of @xmath21 ( @xmath22 in gev ) and spatial resolutions of @xmath23 mrad and @xmath24 cm for electrons .",
    "a solenoidal magnet outside the bsc provides a 0.4 t magnetic field in the central tracking region of the detector .",
    "three double - layer muon counters instrument the magnet flux return and serve to identify muons with momentum greater than 500 mev / c .",
    "they cover @xmath25 of the total solid angle .",
    "the data used for this analysis were collected at the center - of - mass energy of 3.773 gev with the beijing spectrometer  @xcite at beijing electron positron collider .",
    "the total integrated luminosity of the data set is 17.3 @xmath3 , which is obtained based on analysis of large angle bhabha scattering from the same data set .",
    "the measurements of the cross sections for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 production are made based on the analysis of singly tagged @xmath27 and @xmath28 events . at the center - of - mass energy @xmath19 gev , the @xmath27 ( through this paper , charge conjugation is implied ) and @xmath28 are produced in pair via the process of @xmath29 the total observed number @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) of @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) meson and the observed cross section @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) are related as @xmath34 and @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the integrated luminosity of the data set used in the analysis , @xmath37 is the branching fraction for decay mode in question , and @xmath38 is the efficiency determined from monte carlo for reconstruction of this decay mode .    in the measurements of the cross sections ,",
    "the singly tagged neutral and charged @xmath39 mesons are observed in the invariant mass spectra of the daughter particles from the @xmath39 decay .",
    "the neutral and charged @xmath39 mesons are reconstructed in the final states of @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "events which contain at least two reconstructed charged - tracks with good helix fits are selected . in order to ensure well - measured 3-momentum vectors and reliable charged - particle identification , the charged tracks used in the single tag analysis",
    "are required to be within @xmath430.85 , where @xmath44 is the angle with respect to beam direction .",
    "all tracks must originate from the interaction region , which require that the closest approach of the charged track in @xmath45 plane is less than 2.0 cm and the @xmath46 position of the charged track is less than 20.0 cm .",
    "pions and kaons are identified by means of tof and @xmath14 measurements .",
    "the pion identification requires a consistency with the pion hypothesis at a confidence level greater than 0.1% . in order to reduce misidentification ,",
    "the kaon candidate is required to have a larger confidence level for a kaon hypothesis than that for a pion hypothesis .",
    "taking advantage of the @xmath4 pair production , we use a kinematic fit to candidate @xmath27 or @xmath28 decays to improve the ratio of signal to noise and mass resolution in the invariant mass spectrum . the energy - constraint is imposed on the measured momenta of the @xmath39 daughter particles via the kinematic fit to improve the measured charged track three - momenta .",
    "events with a kinematic fit probability greater than @xmath47 are accepted .",
    "if more than one combination satisfies the fit probability greater than @xmath47 , the combination with the largest fit probability is retained .    the resulting distributions of the fitted masses of @xmath48 ( @xmath49 , or @xmath50 , or @xmath51 ) combinations , which are calculated using the fitted momentum vectors from the kinematic fit , are shown in figure 1 . the signals for @xmath27 and @xmath28 production are clearly observed in the fitted mass spectra .",
    "a maximum likelihood fit is performed to the mass spectrum , a gaussian is used to model the signal shape and a special function [ 6 ] is used to describe the background shape .",
    "the @xmath27 and @xmath28 yields obtained from this fit is given in table i.     ( m=1 , or 2 , or 3 ) combinations for three singly tagged modes , where figure ( a ) and figure ( b ) are for the decay modes of @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively , and the figure ( c ) is for the decay mode of @xmath54 . ,",

    "the tree level cross section for @xmath60 production in qed is given by @xmath61 where the @xmath62 is the center - of - mass energy in gev .",
    "a measurement of @xmath58  @xcite is obtained by dividing @xmath63 by the tree level muon pair cross section , which gives @xmath64 bes - ii experiment measured @xmath6@xcite , which is the ratio of the tree level light hadron ( containing the u , d and s light quarks ) cross section over that for @xmath60 production in the energy region from 2.0 to 3.0 gev .",
    "theoretical expectation is that @xmath6 is approximately independent of center - of - mass energy in this region  @xcite .",
    "fitting to the @xmath6 values at 9 energy points in the energy region , we obtain @xmath65 . assuming that @xmath7 decays exclusively into @xmath5 , the value of @xmath59 is evaluated using @xmath66 , which gives @xmath67",
    "in summary , using the 17.3 @xmath3 of data collected with the bes - ii detector at bepc at center - of - mass energy @xmath19 gev , the observed cross sections for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath4 production have been measured .",
