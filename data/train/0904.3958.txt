    "at the end of the stellar evolution on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars loose copious amounts of mass , which build up a circumstellar dust and gas shell hiding the star from optical view almost completely .",
    "stars departing from the agb and evolving towards the planetary nebula ( pn ) phase are therefore difficult to observe optically .",
    "it was found that a number of proto - planetary nebulae ( cf . in crl 2688 ; @xcite @xcite ) show high velocity bipolar outflows which are connected to a fast , axially - symmetric wind , which is taking the place of the much slower , spherically - symmetric wind operating on the agb .",
    "the physical mechanism responsible for the change of the spherically - symmetric to an axially - symmetric , or in some cases point - symmetric wind is strongly debated .",
    "observations of masers in transition objects often reveal that this morphological change takes place at a very early stage in the post - agb phase ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) , while the star is still heavily obscured in the optical range .",
    "non - variable oh / ir stars @xcite and iras selected infrared sources with extreme red colors @xcite are candidates for such hidden post - agb stars .",
    "their study has made progress only in the last decade due to the improved observation capabilities in the infrared at @xmath4 m by space - based observatories . in the mid - infrared",
    "the emission emerges from the circumstellar envelopes ( cse ) and their gas and dust composition has to be used to infer on the evolutionary state of the underlying star and the mass loss process .    the spectroscopic observations with iso showed that strong changes occur in the infrared seds during total obscuration @xcite .",
    "in the case of the c - rich agb stars the molecular c@xmath1h@xmath1 absorption and the amorphous sic emission feature at 11.3@xmath5 m suddenly disappear and become substituted by a broad plateau of emission from 11 to 15@xmath5 m due to hydrogenated pahs .",
    "these are later replaced by de - hydrogenated , narrow pah features at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 and 11.3@xmath5 m , which are also observed in more evolved c - rich pne . in o - rich agb stars the strong silicate absorption features at 9.7 and 18@xmath5 m disappear and are replaced by several prominent crystalline silicate emission features in the @xmath6 m wavelength range .",
    "a mixed chemistry is found also in a few sources , but it is not clear whether it is associated to late thermal pulses at the end of the agb phase and/or to the preservation of o - rich material in long - lived circumstellar disks .",
    "globally considered , there seems to be a continuous evolution from an amorphous ( aliphatic ) to crystalline ( aromatic ) organization of molecules in the dust grains both in the c - rich and the o - rich sequence , which is still unexplained @xcite .",
    "the akari satellite @xcite and the spitzer space telescope @xcite offered the possibility to extend the iso observations to larger and better selected samples of hidden post - agb stars .",
    "observations between 2 and 26@xmath5 m were possible with the infrared camera ( irc ) @xcite on board of akari , and in the range @xmath7 m with the infrared spectrograph ( irs ) @xcite on board of spitzer .",
    "a first sample studied consisted of obscured oh / ir sources with associated radio continuum emission .",
    "the spitzer spectra allowed a re - classification of the sources in agb stars and post - agb stars close to the formation of pns @xcite .",
    "the new samples observed , consisted of extremely red iras sources from the glmp catalog @xcite , and of oh / ir stars selected on the base of their appearance in the spitzer glimpse survey . the 2mass and glimpse surveys were used to identify oh / ir stars with near - infrared excesses indicative for a post - agb nature of these sources @xcite .",
    "the seds of obscured variable oh / ir stars peak in the wavelength range @xmath8 m and show a strong 10@xmath5 m and a weaker 18@xmath5 m absorption feature .",
    "these seds can be modeled in detail using cold dust opacity functions of amorphous silicates @xcite .",
    "this is confirmed by the results we obtained from the modeling of the akari spectra of the infrared sources classified as agb stars ( bunzel et al . , these proceedings ) .",
    "the carbon - rich cousins of oh / ir stars are the extreme carbon stars ( extreme in terms of infrared color ) .",
    "the dust features seen in their seds are usually weak , but they often show a molecular absorption line at @xmath9 m attributed to c@xmath1h@xmath1 .",
    "the extreme carbon stars are rarer than oh / ir stars and harder to classify because of the lack of prominent dust features and radio maser emission . before akari ,",
    "the most extreme carbon stars were studied by @xcite , who modeled the seds successfully with amorphous carbon dust .",
    "they found the evolutionary status compatible with the end phase of agb evolution .",
    "the extreme carbon stars , we identified among the infrared sources observed with akari , are the reddest found so far .",
    "the spectra of all of them ( except iras15408 - 5657 ) could be modeled with amorphous carbon dust ( @xmath10 ) , with minor contributions of sic and silicates .",
    "because of a low iras variability index we suspect that part of them could have started post - agb evolution already ( garca - hernndez et al . , these proceedings ) .",
    "iras15408 - 5657 is a peculiar source , in the sense that its silicate absorption features are too weak for its red continuum .",
    "the model sed required a mixture of carbon and silicate dust in almost equal parts to obtain the appropriate strength of the silicate band .",
    "its low iras variability index makes it a post - agb candidate .",
    "it is unlikely that both dust species spatially coexist , because the underabundant atomic species ( c or o ) should be locked in co , and would not be available for dust formation @xcite .",
    "thus , the mixed chemistry may indicate the presence of two shells , an inner shell with c - rich dust and an outer one with o - rich dust .    for several sources with silicate absorption features observed by bunzel et al .",
    "with akari we had indications for their post - agb nature beforehand . either due to the presence of bipolar high - velocity outflows traced by the h@xmath1o masers ( iras19134 + 2131 , @xcite @xcite ; oh31.0 + 0.0 = w43a , @xcite @xcite ) , or due to the presence of a near - infrared excess . as for iras15408 - 5657 the seds of these sources could not be modeled by pure amorphous silicate dust , but required a model , where the inner carbon - rich shell is viewed through an outer shell containing 20 - 40% silicate dust .",
    "the results for these post - agb stars and for iras15408 - 5657 indicate that for oxygen - rich agb stars the departure from the agb marks also a change in dust chemistry .",
    "carbon - rich dust forms in the inner shell , while the silicate - rich dust shell formed on the agb expands outwards .      a preliminary evaluation of the spitzer spectra in the @xmath11 m range and the @xmath0 m seds of 88 iras sources from the glmp catalog confirm the akari results and show that the mid - ir spectra are even more diversified than expected . judged from the iras variability index almost all these sources have a chance of @xmath12% to be variable and are therefore currently post - agb stars .",
    "based on the spectra and the @xmath0 m seds they can be divided into several groups :    * about 45% have strong silicate absorption features and are heavily obscured in the near - infrared",
    ". these are former o - rich agb stars , where the remnant agb shell dominate the mid - ir spectra .",
    "* another 15% show the combination of a very red continuum longward of @xmath13 m and a weak silicate absorption .",
    "about two - third of them have a near - infrared excess at @xmath14 m as it is exemplified in iras18355@xmath150712 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sp18355 ] ) .",
    "these sources are similar to the akari observed post - agb stars , which required a mixed chemistry to model their seds .",
    "* three sources show evidence for the presence of crystalline silicate dust judged from sharp absorption features in the @xmath16 m region .",
    "all of them are oh / ir stars with a relatively blue continuum ( see fig . [",
    "fig : sp18470]a ) . *",
    "another 20% show featureless spectra ( see iras11444 - 6150 in fig . [",
    "fig : sp18470]b ) , spectra with c@xmath1h@xmath1 absorption at 13.7@xmath5 m or weak carbon dust features .",
    "almost half of them show a near - infrared excess as in iras18355@xmath150712 .",
    "these objects are probably post - agb carbon stars with varying degrees of optical depths of their remnant agb shells and where the objects with a near - infrared excess are the more evolved . *",
    "the remaining objects have ( in part strong ) near - infrared excesses and show a variety of carbon dust features in their spectra .",
    "an example is iras19176 + 1251 , which shows strong pah features and in addition a ne 12.8@xmath5 m emission line , coming probably from material shocked by the stellar wind ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sp19176 ] ) .",
    "these objects are considered as the most advanced in their post - agb evolution .",
    "post - agb evolution starts when almost the complete stellar envelope has been lost by the stellar wind , and the stars are still hidden by their circumstellar envelope .",
    "such stars do not show the agb typical long - period variability anymore .",
    "the akari and spitzer spectra of such hidden post - agb stars indicate that the inner part of the cses contains carbon - rich dust formed in the post - agb wind irrespective of the chemistry of the star on the agb .",
    "the silicate absorption features seen in many of the sources may originate from the outer cse , which is composed mainly by dust of the remnant agb shell .",
    "these conclusions can be probed in those stars , where the remnant agb shell has been diluted far enough , that observations of the warm dust near the star are possible .",
    "spectroscopy in the @xmath17 m range using the irc during the akari warm phase will therefore be made , to search for c - rich matter in the inner dust shell of those post - agb stars showing the @xmath16 m silicate absorption and a strong near - infrared excess .",
    "this research is based on observations with akari , a jaxa project with the participation of esa , and on observations with spitzer , a nasa s great observatories program .",
