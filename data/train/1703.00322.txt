    "<S> atoms are confined in a harmonic potential , which complicates the picture . to zeroth order in fluctuations , the density profile of the gas </S>",

    "<S> ] at finite temperature , excitation modes above this thomas - fermi profile get populated . </S>",
    "<S> if the loss rate is sufficiently small , one expects that each mode adiabatically follows the changes of the thomas - fermi shape , such that each mode can be treated independently and , within the pure classical field approximation , eq  ( [ eq.domega ] ) is still valid , where @xmath18 is now a positive integer that indexes the mode . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency of phononic modes , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ modes of energy much smaller than the chemical potential @xmath97 , are well approximated by @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the harmonic trapping frequency  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for modes which stay within the phonon regime during the entire loss process , eq .  ( [ eq.domega ] ) </S>",
    "<S> predicts that their temperature decreases as @xmath100 .    </S>",
    "<S> the description of higher - energy modes , called particle modes , is not simple since they explore regions where the thomas - fermi density vanishes and the quasi - condensate approximation fails . </S>",
    "<S> it is reasonable however to believe that the energy spectrum at energies much larger than @xmath97 is close to the energy spectrum of free particles , so that frequencies of these modes are equally spaced , separated by @xmath99 . since the chemical potential decreases during the loss process </S>",
    "<S> , many excitations initially in the phononic regime are transferred to the particle regime . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider such an excitation . </S>",
    "<S> its frequency goes from @xmath101 before the loss process , . ] to about @xmath102 at the end of the loss process when it lies in the particle regime . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio @xmath103 is thus larger than one . according to the classical field prediction of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq.domega ] ) , one therefore expects these excitations to attain a higher temperature than those lower excitations staying within the phonon regime .    </S>",
    "<S> the effect of shot noise on the loss process is not easy to treat for a trapped gas . </S>",
    "<S> however , we expect that , as in the case of a homogeneous gas , the quantum noise will amplify the non - thermal behavior of the system , so the temperature differences between modes could be even larger .    _ </S>",
    "<S> experimental observation of a long - lived non - thermal state  </S>",
    "<S> _ observing the non - thermal nature of the gas experimentally requires the ability to address modes of different energies independently . </S>",
    "<S> this is _ a priori _ not an easy task for gases confined in a box since all modes overlap spatially . </S>",
    "<S> however , since the atomic clouds in typical experiments are confined longitudinally in a slowly varying harmonic potential , there is some spatial separation of modes of different energy . at very low temperatures , thermal excitations of energy larger than @xmath104 </S>",
    "<S> give the density profile ` wings ' that extend beyond the thomas - fermi inverted parabola of peak density @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , low - energy excitations lying in the phononic regime do not extend beyond the thomas - fermi profile , but are responsible for long wavelength density fluctuations in the central region of the cloud . </S>",
    "<S> the density profile of the gas is thus most sensitive to high - energy excitations . </S>",
    "<S> low - energy excitations , on the other hand , can be probed by investigating , within the thomas - fermi profile , atom - number fluctuations @xmath106 , in pixels of length @xmath107 much larger than the healing length @xmath108  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , we prepare clouds of @xmath109rb atoms by radio - frequency evaporation in our atom - chip experiment , as described in  @xcite , and we record a set of density profiles taken under the same experimental conditions . </S>",
    "<S> the longitudinal trapping frequency is 6.2 hz , while the transverse confinement is 1.9 khz . </S>",
    "<S> atoms are polarized in the @xmath110 hyperfine ground state , where the interactions are characterized by the @xmath17-wave scattering length @xmath111 . since the local density approximation </S>",
    "<S> is well fulfilled longitudinally , the equilibrium profile can be computed using the equation of state for longitudinally homogeneous gases , @xmath112 , where @xmath97 is the chemical potential . using the well - established modified yang - yang equation of state  @xcite , where the effective 1d coupling constant is @xmath113 , the experimental density profile </S>",
    "<S> is fitted for a temperature @xmath114nk ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.all_exp ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also extract atom - number fluctuations @xmath106 in each pixel from the same dataset , giving an independent temperature measurement . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath107 is both much smaller than the cloud size and much larger than the healing length , the physics of homogeneous gases is locally probed and thermodynamics predicts @xmath115  @xcite . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.all_exp ] , we plot @xmath106 versus the mean atom number in the pixel . fitting the large atom - number region , corresponding to pixels lying inside the thomas - fermi profile , with the fluctuation - dissipation relation and the quasi - condensate equation of state </S>",
    "<S> , we extract a temperature @xmath116  nk ( as summarized in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.all_exp ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between @xmath117 and @xmath118 is a signature that the cloud is out - of - equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> we also confirmed that , after the radio - frequency loss mechanism has been removed , this situation is stable over the cloud lifetime of about one second ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.all_exp ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the profile is more sensitive to high - energy excitations while the density fluctuations are more sensitive to low energy excitations , the fact that @xmath119 could be related to the above quantitative study of homogeneous gases and the qualitative arguments given for the trapped system . in the experiments presented in @xcite , only low - energy excitations were probed and consequently this non - thermal character was not revealed .    </S>",
    "<S> to conclude , we theoretically investigated the long - lived non - thermal state produced by the non - selective removal of atoms in order to cool a uniform one - dimensional bose gas . </S>",
    "<S> this dissipation drives the system out - of - equilibrium , with different excitation modes losing energies at different rates . </S>",
    "<S> this out - of - equilibrium character is robust against coupling between modes introduced in the gross - pitaevskii equation , and is related to the integrable nature of the considered system . </S>",
    "<S> we performed simulations of a two - species bose mixture with different masses , a non - integrable system , and confirmed a slow relaxation towards an equipartition of energy between excitations . </S>",
    "<S> truncated wigner simulations that go beyond the pure classical - field description and include the shot - noise associated to the loss process due to the quantized nature of the atomic field further confirmed the non - thermal nature of the state produced by dissipation . finally , we discussed the relevance of our findings for experimental realizations of 1d bose gases trapped in a harmonic potential . from a theoretical point of view </S>",
    "<S> , in the linearized classical field approach , a small temperature difference between modes of different energies is indeed expected , and this effect could be amplified by the presence of quantum noise . in our quasi - condensate experiments , we indeed have signatures of a non - thermal character since different thermometries that probe different parts of the excitation spectrum give substantially different temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> however , a more careful and quantitative description in the trap , perhaps via finite - temperature classical field simulations @xcite , is still required in order to draw firm conclusions on the relation between these experimental long - lived non - thermal states and our theoretical findings .    </S>",
