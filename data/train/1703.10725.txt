    "hardware security has become an important aspect in modern integrated circuit ( ic ) design industry because of the global supply chain business model .",
    "identifying and authenticating each fabricated components of a chip is a challenging task @xcite .",
    "a physical unclonable function ( puf ) has been a promising security primitive such that its behavior , or challenge response pair ( crp ) @xcite , is uniquely defined and is hard to predict or replicate .",
    "a puf can enable low overhead hardware identification , tracing , and authentication during the global manufacturing chain .",
    "silicon delay based strong pufs have been studied intensively since its first appearance in @xcite because of its low implementation cost and large crp space compared with a weak puf @xcite . however , there are still design challenges that restrain a strong puf from being put in a widespread practical use .",
    "one of the major design challenges for a silicon delay based puf is the strict symmetric delay path layout requirement .",
    "the wire delays of the competing paths should be designed and matched carefully to avoid biased responses , otherwise low inter - chip uniqueness would make the puf unusable @xcite .",
    "in addition to asymmetric routing , another source of the biased responses for silicon based puf is the systematic process variation , which can also degrade the quality of a puf , such as uniqueness or unpredictability .",
    "finally , the metastability issue of the arbiter circuit for an arbiter puf can cause unstable puf responses , making a portion of the crp unusable due to their instabilities @xcite .      for a delay based puf , the randomness should be contributed only by the subtle variations between devices , so having biased delay differences due to asymmetric routing is detrimental to delay based pufs , and such impact should be eliminated . however",
    ", a precise control of the routing can be a difficult and time consuming task .",
    "an implementation of an arbiter puf on field programmable gate array ( fpga ) is considered much more difficult than a ro puf because the connections to the arbiter circuit must also be symmetric @xcite , and performing completely symmetric routing is physically infeasible in most cases @xcite , resulting small inter - fractional hamming distance ( fhd ) for an arbiter puf @xcite .",
    "one of the most common solutions to the asymmetric routing is to use hard - macros in fpga designs @xcite , but it is not effective with arbiter puf , and some less commonly - used features of the fpga would be required @xcite .",
    "other approaches try to extract randomness by xoring the outputs of multiple arbiter pufs at the cost of large hardware overhead and less stability @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors proposed using ` middle ' bits instead of the most significant bit ( msb ) as the ro puf response measurement .",
    "the measurement can effectively eliminate the biased responses , but an efficient way of predicting the inspection bit is not described , and the presented ro puf is not a strong puf . a rtl - based puf bit generation unit was proposed in @xcite , but to the best of our knowledge , a strong puf that can be implemented efficiently without any layout constraints has not yet been proposed .",
    "the existence of systematic process variation can degrade the quality of silicon based pufs because the local randomness should be the only desired entropy source of the delay based puf @xcite .",
    "the effect of systematic process variation is similar to having biased wire delay between two delay paths , which can also damage the uniqueness of the puf .",
    "another possible vulnerability caused by systematic variation is the induced process side channel attack as described in @xcite . due to intra - wafer systematic variation @xcite , pufs fabricated at the same region on different wafers",
    "can have similar systematic behavior , which can be exploited as a process side channel attack .    to account for systematic variations ,",
    "a compensation technique is proposed in @xcite , which requires careful design decisions to compare ro pairs that are physically placed close to each other . in @xcite ,",
    "the systematic variation is modeled and subtracted from the puf response to distill true randomness with the cost of model calculation .",
    "similarly , in @xcite , the averaged ro frequency is subtracted from the original frequency , where the multiple measurements of each ro can lead to large latency overhead . in @xcite ,",
    "a method is proposed to extract local random process variation from total variation , however , a second order difference calculation is needed , and hard - macro technique must be applied to construct symmetric delay paths .",
    "the idea of an arbiter puf is to introduce a race condition on two paths and an arbiter circuit is used to decide which one of the two paths reached first .",
    "the arbiter circuit is usually a d flip - flop or a sr latch .",
    "if two signals arrive at an arbiter within a short time , the arbiter circuit may enter a metastable state due to setup time violation @xcite .",
    "once the arbiter circuit is in metastable state , the response becomes unstable . to eliminate the inconsistency caused by metastability of the arbiter circuit , existing approaches use the majority vote or to choose the paths that have a delay difference larger than the metastable window @xmath0 at the cost of crp characterization and discarding the unstable crps @xcite .      in this paper ,",
    "we propose the physical implementation bias agnostic ( unbias ) puf that is immune to physical implementation bias .",
    "the contributions of this paper include :    * we proposed the first strong unbias puf that can be implemented purely by rtl without imposing any physical routing constraints .",
    "* efficient inspection bit selection strategy based on intra-/inter - fhd prediction models are proposed and verified on the strong unbias puf .",
    "the proposed strong unbias puf compares two delay paths to generate puf responses .",
    "similar to arbiter puf , each bit of the challenge of the unbias puf specifies the path configuration of the delay path .",
    "as shown in figure [ figure : biaspuf ] , the challenge c1 and c2 specify the path configurations , and an one - bit response is extracted from the difference register , which can be of several bits long .",
    "once a challenge is given , a signal is applied at trigger .",
    "each of the clock counter begins to count the number of clock cycles of the system clock ( clk ) whenever the the signal from trigger is propagated to the start input of the counter , and stops counting whenever the the signal from trigger is propagated to the stop input of the counter . for each challenge",
    ", the difference value of the two clock counters is stored in the difference register for further response extraction , which is described in details in section [ sec : measurement ] .",
    "the purpose of the ros inserted between path configurations is to increase the path delay so that it will take multiple clock cycles for the signal to propagate to stop the clock counter .",
    "as shown in figure [ figure : ro_delay ] , each ro is associated with a ro counter that counts the number of oscillations of the ro .",
    "the ro counter starts counting when the signal from its previous path configuration is arrived , and propagates the signal to the next path configuration only when the count reaches a certain threshold .",
    "all the ros are composed of same number of inverters and neither configurations nor any layout constraints are needed .        unlike the conventional arbiter puf , the strong unbias puf has no metastability issues caused by a d flip - flop or a latch .",
    "the delay difference of the two paths is transformed into counter values of the system clock . by judiciously extracting the response from the difference",
    "register , the physical implementation bias can be effectively mitigated , therefore the unbias puf can be implemented purely by rtl without any routing or layout constraints .",
    "details of the response extraction are described in section [ sec : measurement ] .",
    "in this section we describe how different selections of the inspection bit can change the intra- and inter - fhd .",
    "figure [ figure : ud ] shows an example of a distribution of values from difference registers of symmetrically routed unbias pufs .",
    "the length of the difference register is 22-bit , so the range of the register value is between @xmath1 and @xmath2 as represented in 2s - complement .",
    "the large inter - chip measurement curve gives the distribution of the values across all pufs .",
    "since the puf is unbiased , roughly half of the difference values would be greater than zero due to random local process variation , therefore the inter - fhd of the unbias pufs would be close to 50% . in this case , the inspection bit is simply the msb , which divides the range of 22-bit difference value into two groups @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "all measurements fall into @xmath3 on the left output a 1 ; others output a 0 .",
    "the small intra - chip measurement curve gives the distribution of multiple measurements of the puf on a same chip .",
    "due to noise , the difference values could be different , so the intra - fhd of the difference register may not be a perfect 0% .        even though symmetric unbias puf",
    "layout is much preferred , it is difficult and takes much effort and overhead to achieve such requirement as described in section [ section : r_works ] . in practice ,",
    "if no layout constraints are imposed , the measurement distribution of the difference register can be as shown in figure [ figure : bd ] , where most of the difference values across chips are greater than zero . in this case , using the msb as the inspection bit would cause low inter - fhd of the pufs because most msbs are 0 s .        for the same biased distribution shown in figure [ figure : bd ] , if the @xmath5 bit is used as the inspection bit of the difference register as figure [ figure : bd_bin ] shows , the range of the 22-bit difference value is divided into multiple bins with width @xmath6 , where the output of the measurement is decided by the bin in which it resides .",
    "note that in this case the response is not an indicator of which delay is longer in the comparison .",
    "the smaller the width of the bin is , the closer the inter - fhd is to 50% because roughly half of the outputs would reside in @xmath3 even with biased delay . on the other hand",
    ", the width of the bin should be large enough so that multiple measurements of a same puf should always fall into the same bin .",
    "in other words , the width of the bin should be larger than the variation of the intra - chip measurement distribution .",
    "therefore , the choice of inspection bit is a tradeoff between inter - fhd and intra - fhd for a puf with asymmetric routing .",
    ", therefore the inter - fhd would be close to 50%.,width=278 ]",
    "the intra - fhd depends on the width of the bins @xmath7 when the inspection bit is @xmath8 .",
    "a straightforward way to determine the associated intra - fhd for each inspection location is to gather multiple measurements of the same challenge on a same puf , and simply calculate the intra - fhd for each @xmath8 .",
    "a more efficient approach is to predict the intra - fhd without calculating it for each @xmath8 .",
    "to predict intra - fhd@xmath9 of a challenge @xmath10 of an inspection bit , we first obtain @xmath11 measured difference registers of the challenge @xmath10 of a same puf . since the bin width and the range of the difference register",
    "is known , the @xmath11 difference values can be divided into two groups ( responses ) according to the bins they reside in .",
    "let the number of difference values fall in @xmath3 be @xmath12 , and number of difference values fall in @xmath4 be @xmath13 . @xmath12 and",
    "@xmath13 represent the number of responses of the challenge @xmath10 to be one and zero during the @xmath11 measurements , respectively .",
    "since the intra - fhd is essentially calculated from the response difference between any two measurements , the predicted intra - fhd@xmath9 is calculated as :    @xmath14    where the final predicted intra - fhd would be the averaged intra - fhd@xmath9 of all challenges .",
    "as shown in figure [ figure : vw ] , the expected intra - fhd@xmath15 is 0% because all measurements fall in the same bin and @xmath16 .",
    "the expected intra - fhd@xmath17 depends on the portion of measured values that fall in @xmath3 . with larger bin width @xmath18",
    ", it is more likely that all responses would fall into the same bin     with three bins .",
    "@xmath18 is the bin width and the measurement ranges for challenges @xmath19 and @xmath20 are specified .",
    "the expected intra - fhd@xmath15 is 0% and the expected intra - fhd@xmath17 depends on the portion of measured values that fall in @xmath3.,width=259 ]      the inter - fhd depends on the bin width @xmath18 with a given inspection bit @xmath8 . assume the distribution of inter - chip difference value is a normal distribution @xmath21 . define @xmath22 to be the distance between the mean @xmath23 and the closest bin boundary on the left as figure [ figure : iwc ] shows .",
    "we first prove that the worst - case inter - fhd happens when @xmath24 , followed by the prediction model of the inter - fhd for the worst - case scenario .",
    "given a fixed @xmath18 , define @xmath25 and @xmath26 to be the total underlying area in @xmath3 and @xmath4 as functions of @xmath22 , respectively .",
    "for any normal distribution , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are calculated as :    a_1 ( ) & = _",
    "n=-^ f(-+2nw+w)-f(-+2nw ) [ eq : a1 ] + a_0 ( ) & = 1 - a_1(,w ) [ eq : a0 ]    where @xmath27 is the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the normal distribution , and @xmath28 is the index for bin area summation .",
    "the ratio @xmath29 is defined as : @xmath30 where the range of @xmath22 is from 0 to @xmath18 because of its periodic structure .",
    "the closer the @xmath29 is to one , the closer the inter - fhd would be to 50% because the two areas are closer to each other .",
    "we want to show that the largest ( most unbalanced ) ratio happens at @xmath24 as figure [ figure : iwc ] shows .    to find the extreme value of @xmath29 given a fixed @xmath18 , we take derivative with respective to @xmath22 of equation [ eq : ratio ] and replace @xmath26 by @xmath31 from equation [ eq : a0 ] : @xmath32    from equation [ eq : ratio_de ] we see that to find the extreme value of @xmath29 , it is equivalent to find the solution of @xmath33 , which is given below : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the probability density function ( pdf ) of the normal distribution .",
    "equation [ eq : a1_de ] shows that @xmath33 is the summation of differences between two pdf terms where one is a shifted version by @xmath18 of another .",
    "therefore , applying @xmath24 to equation [ eq : a1_de ] , we get a zero .",
    "figure [ figure : iwc ] shows that when @xmath24 , each difference term in equation [ eq : a1_de ] has its counter part at the mirrored location to the center , so that the summation becomes zero .",
    "to conclude our derivation , given a @xmath18 of an inspection bit , the extreme value of @xmath29 happens when @xmath24 , and the inter - chip stander deviation @xmath36 is needed for the @xmath29 calculation .",
    "to predict inter - fhd , we calculate the probability of which any pair of chips produce different responses .",
    "the inter - fhd prediction given the width @xmath18 of the inspection bit is : @xmath37    with @xmath38 , the two areas are the same , resulting a predicted 50% inter - fhd .",
    "given a selected @xmath39 , plugging in @xmath24 to equation [ eq : iner ] would give the predicted inter - fhd lower bound .",
    "please note that to predict inter - fhd , the inter - chip standard deviation @xmath36 is needed because the calculation involves the cdf .",
    "however , the mean @xmath23 does not affect the prediction because the extreme value is obtained by finding the worst - case @xmath22 .",
    "also , since changing the inspection bit results at least a 2x change of @xmath18 , the inter - chip @xmath36 does not have to be calculated with high accuracy .",
    "it can be obtained by pre - layout simulation or measuring a small number of chips .",
    "given the error correction code ( ecc ) specification corresponding to the puf design , the intra - fhd threshold can be defined . from the intra - fhd prediction model , choose a set of candidate bits that would satisfy the intra - fhd threshold requirement .",
    "from the candidate bits , a best inspection bit can be determined by applying the inter - fhd prediction model given the standard deviation @xmath36 of the inter - chip delay distribution .",
    "please note that only one chip is needed for the inspection bit selection since the measurement noise is similar for all chips from our experiment and the @xmath36 is obtained from pre - layout simulation .",
    "the location of the final inspection bit , which is a public information , is passed to all pufs for the secret response generation .",
    "the strong unbias puf structure is implemented on 7 altera de2 - 115 fpga boards . in our implementation ,",
    "no physical constraints , additional xors , tunable delay units , or any systematic variation compensation techniques are used .",
    "the design is purely a rtl design .",
    "the ros inserted between path configurations are composed of 19 inverters , and the signal will be propagated to the next path configuration when the ro counter associated to the ro reaches a count of 50 thousand .",
    "the unbias puf has 10 path configurations , therefore the length of the challenge is 10-bit long .",
    "the length of the difference register is 19-bit , and the length of the final response for each challenge is one bit . for our experiment ,",
    "120 challenges are applied , and 120 bits of responses are obtained for each puf within a second . please note that the ro structure and the count of the ro counter are selected given the 50 mhz system clock of the fpga .",

    "the prediction gap is relatively large when @xmath18 is much larger than @xmath36 .",
