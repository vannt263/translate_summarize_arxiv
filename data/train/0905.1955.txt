    "the experiments in the high energy accelerators of cern and fermilab in the period from 1960 to 1990 collected data on the differential cross sections @xmath7 for the systems pp and p@xmath5 at the center of mass energies @xmath8 gev . along",
    "almost 50 years since the beginning of these studies of high energy hadronic scattering , many theoretical models were developed , but the experimental data stopped increasing in quantity or quality , as the accelerators were discontinued .",
    "the phenomenology and theoretical treatments of these systems are thus restricted in several aspects .",
    "the theoretical literature is enormous , now with increased interest due to the higher energy data that will come from lhc operation @xcite , and in the present work we do not analyse or compare the many dynamical and phenomenological efforts .",
    "to study of the dynamics that governs the processes , it is necessary to disentangle the squared moduli of complex quantities that represent the measured quantities in terms of the imaginary and real parts , which are intrinsically combined with the coulomb contribution .    in the region of small momentum transfers @xmath6 , the intense coulomb amplitude added to the nuclear interaction creates an interference that is observable in the @xmath6 distribution in @xmath7 .",
    "this coulomb interference region of low @xmath6 values goes typically up to @xmath9 , but we show that the form of @xmath7 in general can actually be described in terms of simple exponential real and imaginary nuclear amplitudes well beyond this range .    in previous analysis of the pp and p@xmath5 data , the real and imaginary nuclear amplitudes were considered as having the same exponential dependence @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the slope of the log plot of @xmath7 .",
    "this simplifying assumption is not adequate , according to dispersion relations @xcite and according to the theorem of a. martin @xcite that says that the position of the zero of the real amplitude is close and approaches @xmath12 as the energy increases .",
    "both results indicate that the slope of the real amplitude should be larger than that of the imaginary one , and in the present work we investigate the description of the coulomb interference region allowing for different real and imaginary slopes .",
    "we review the scattering data in cases where this kind of information can be looked for .    in sec .",
    "ii we review the expressions for the observable quantities in the forward region , and obtain the expression of the intervening relative phase for the more general case of different slopes for the real and imaginary amplitudes . in sec .",
    "iii we analyse the differential cross sections for the energies in pp and p@xmath5 scattering where data are more favorable . in sec .",
    "iv we present some remarks and conclusions .",
    "in elastic pp and p@xmath5 collisions , the combined nuclear and coulomb amplitudes is written @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the coulomb part @xmath15 with the proton electromagnetic form factor @xmath16 associated to a relative phase @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the strong interaction complexe amplitude @xmath19    the phase @xmath17 was initially studied by west and yennie @xcite , and different evaluations have been worked out by several authors @xcite . in the present work we extend these investigations considering the possibility of different slopes for the real and imaginary amplitudes .    in the normalization that we use @xcite the differential cross section",

    "we present these cases .",
    "it is important to remark that the results obtained in the fittings in general depend strongly on the set of data of low @xmath6 selected for the analysis of the coulomb interference region .",
    "this shows that the data accumulated in these experiments are not detailed and regular enough to allow precise determination of the amplitudes in the forward direction .",
    "we stress that in this paper we do not intend to give new better values for parameters .",
    "instead , we show that the analysis of the data leads to rather ample possibilities .",
    "the values of forward scattering parameters for pp scattering at fermilab and cern isr energies given in the standard literature are given in table [ basic ] .",
    "the data at @xmath55 gev come from fermilab , and that at 23.5 - 62.5 gev are from the cern isr , with a review by amaldi and schubert @xcite .    .",

    "obviously , as @xmath60 approaches the origin , @xmath1 grows with the energy .",
    "the numbers indicate much indetermination in this analysis of the old data .",
    "in particular , identification of the values of @xmath46 and @xmath1 seems to be difficult .",
    "dispersion relations must be used as a guide towards the disentanglement , in particular with application of the derivative dispersion relations for slopes @xcite .",
    "we recall that the energy dependence in the measurements is crucial for the good use of dispersion relations , and we hope that lhc will produce diffractive data at several energies ?",
    "we have performed a detailed analysis of the data on differential elastic cross - sections allowing for the freedom of different slopes for the real and imaginary amplitudes , namely @xmath61 , for the data points obtained in the isr / sps(cern ) and tevatron ( fermilab ) experiments during the years 1960 - 1990 .",
    "the principal conclusion of the present analysis is that different values of the slopes , in particular the possibility of @xmath62 in accordance with the expectations from martin s theorem [ 2 ] and from dispersion relations [ 1 ] , are perfectly consistent within the present errors of experimental data .",
    "our investigation concerns the four quantities relevant for the elastic forward processes , namely , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "studying the behavior of @xmath65 values near its minimum and statistically equivalent parameter ranges , we observe that the available data from cern and from fermilab for small @xmath66 at the energies @xmath67 gev are not sufficient for a precise determination of these four parameters . with real and imaginary amplitudes as independent quantities in the form @xmath68 , the @xmath65 analysis clearly shows a strong correlation among the parameters , exhibiting a very large valley in @xmath65 surface in the parameter space .",
    "this in particular leaves large ambiguities in the determination for the weaker real part .",
    "it is interesting to note that detailed behavior in the @xmath4 surface in the parameter space depends very much on the chosen data sets .",
    "for example , the minimum of @xmath4/degrees - of - freedom varies from 0.1 to 1.3 in different energies . on the other hand ,",
    "the variation of @xmath4 for appreciable changes of some parameters is less than 0.1 percent , in general indicating that their precise determination is not possible within the existing experimental situation .    on the other hand ,",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that , if we have sufficient number of data points in this region , we do not need the absolute normalization of the luminosity , since the coulomb interference can determine correctly the absolute value of cross section as a free parameter , as was shown in this work for the 541 gev case .",
    "of course , this method requires that the low @xmath69 data be very accurate .",
    "it is interesting to note that tests of this of coulomb interference method , introducing a new free normalization parameter into the data set , are found to be compatible in both e-710 and e-741 fermilab data at @xmath70 gev , while the difference in the evaluation of the total cross section remains .",
    "as mentioned before , the quantitative analysis for the disentaglement of the real and imaginary parts of complex amplitude at small @xmath66 can not be made with confidence with the data available up to now .",
    "tests of quantities like the position of the zero of the real amplitude are not safe in these conditions .",
    "thus model independent values for the four parameters can not be obtained accurately .",
    "usually , the models suited for pp dynamics aimed to cover an overall large @xmath66 region , with correct description of dip and tail in @xmath7 , are not sensitive enough to the details of the behavior of scattering amplitudes for very small @xmath71 . in this region , the behavior of the amplitude maybe very sensitive to specific dynamical influences of the non - pertubative qcd dynamics . in particular , the forward scattering amplitude is directly related with the proton structure , and intimately related with the parton distribution function at small @xmath72 and saturation problems .    as a complimentary study , we also performed the analysis of scattering amplitude for a larger @xmath66 domain as proposed in @xcite .",
    "we observe that such analysis , consistent with the general structure of the scattering amplitudes , such as positions of zeros and dips , clearly shows the necessity of the very distinct values of the slope parameters of real and imaginary amplitudes , corroborating with the results obtained here from the analysis in small @xmath66 regions . in terms of scattering amplitude , this different behaviors of real and imaginary part is crucial and will be fundamental to understand the mechanism of elastic scattering amplitude .    of course",
    ", the separation of complex amplitudes will never be a very easy task only from the measured scattering experiments , and it will be unavoidable to make use of other theoretical tools , such as dispersion relations .",
    "particular attention must be given to the development and application of dispersion relations for slope parameters [ 1 ] .",
    "the knowledge of the energy dependence is crucial for the application of these tools in practice , and it is extremely interesting if an energy scan program is also included in the first phase of the lhc operation of p+p collisions .",
    "although no new or better method has been introduced in the present work , our precise analysis has revealed the existence of correlations and related uncertainties of the behavior of the scattering amplitude at small @xmath71 . for quantitative determinations ,",
    "more precise and numerous data points are necessary .",
    "we expect to have a different situation in the future experiments from rhic and lhc , with much better statistics and accuracy in the measurements of scattering data in the coulomb interference region , together with a systematic energy scan program .",
    "the authors wish to thank cnpq ( brazil ) , faperj ( brazil)and pronex ( brazil ) for general support of their research work , including research fellowships and grants .",
    "here we give details of the evaluation of the phase of west and yennie given by eq .",
