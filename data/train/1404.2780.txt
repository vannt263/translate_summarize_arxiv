    "quantum coherence effects encompass a variety of interference effects in the coherences , i.e. , transition amplitudes , between quantum states that are driven by laser light . in quantum optics ,",
    "they have been known for decades .",
    "@xcite in particular , electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) is based on the quantum interference associated with a long - lived coherence , which can make an optically thick medium transparent for a probe field in the presence of a drive field . because the coherent effects also modify the dispersive properties , a very small group velocity may occur for pulses , which is usually referred to as slow light .",
    "electromagnetically induced transparency , group velocity slowdown and other quantum - coherence effects have been intensively investigated in atomic , molecular and optical ( amo ) physics , see , e.g. , refs .  .",
    "there have been different proposals to realize quantum coherence effects in few - level systems in solid state  @xcite and especially semiconductors ,  @xcite because of the possible importance of these effects for optical information processing , such as an optical delay line .",
    "slow light has been achieved in semiconductor quantum wells using setups that employ coherent population oscillations of excitons instead of the eit - type processes in quantum dots ( qds ) considered in the present paper .",
    "@xcite other approaches , for instance , involving slow light in photonic crystals , are also being actively pursued .",
    "@xcite    semiconductor qds , which are arguably the closest realization of a system with localized states and discrete energies in semiconductors , are a natural candidate for the realization of quantum - coherence processes  @xcite in a material , for which extremely advanced growth and processing techniques exist .",
    "however , for electron - hole transitions in semiconductors typical dephasing times severely limit the achievable group velocity slowdown , even in qds ,  @xcite where there is the smallest `` phase space '' for scattering and dephasing processes . as it is known from quantum optics ,",
    "such a pronounced dephasing is detrimental for quantum coherence effects .",
    "depending on the levels that are connected by drive and probe fields , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and ladder schemes can be realized , and these can be compared directly as long as one applies an amo model that assumes dephasing constants for the various polarizations involved in the respective schemes .",
    "@xcite for instance , it has been shown that the structural qd parameters can generally be more easily optimized for @xmath1 schemes than for other schemes .",
    "@xcite    we will discuss in this paper only @xmath1-type schemes , as opposed to the @xmath0 schemes analyzed earlier by us ,  @xcite in which the quantum coherence connected two hole states . in such a @xmath0 setup there is a sizable dephasing of the quantum coherence from the hole states because they are closely spaced and broadened by polaronic interaction effects .",
    "this problem can partly be circumvented by using a short drive pulse ,  @xcite but the time window , during which the probe pulse is slowed down , is too short to be useful for applications .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we make a theoretical proposal for a qd _ molecule _ that is designed to lead to a long - lived coherence between its lowest electronic levels .",
    "the proposed design consists of two qds of different sizes stacked in growth direction , and should be within reach of current fabrication techniques , as evidenced by recent investigations that have shown how qd molecules can be fabricated with prescribed properties .  @xcite the line - up of the energy levels of the proposed qd molecule are not qualitatively different from those of a single ingaas - based qd , for which quantum - coherence effects have already been investigated .",
    "@xcite what sets the molecule apart from the single qd is the `` wave - function engineering '' that leads to dipole matrix elements and dephasing rates that are favorable for group - velocity slowdown .",
    "we demonstrate this by employing a model from semiconductor many - particle physics rather than an amo model . we stress that , while an amo model uses constant dephasing rates for the individual levels and the dipole matrix elements as input , our approach uses the relevant matrix elements from a simplified qd electronic structure calculation and computes , in a microscopic fashion , the dephasing and scattering processes in qd molecules due to the coulomb interaction between charged carriers and/or the carrier - phonon interaction . based on this approach",
    ", we characterize the slow - down factor of these qd molecules in the frequency domain and explicitly calculate the group - velocity slowdown of a probe pulse propagating in a semiconductor host surrounding these model qd molecules . for the dynamical calculation",
    ", we combine a determination of the propagating optical fields , as in refs .",
    ", with a microscopic theory for the calculation of scattering and dephasing processes along the lines of refs .  .",

    "the purpose of this section is to introduce the design of an asymmetric qd molecule with an electronic structure that is particularly well suited for quantum coherence effects in a @xmath1 configuration .",
    "we do not aim at a comprehensive theory of the electronic structure of qd molecules , which would have to include the complicated alloy concentration and strain fields of the qd molecule and the surrounding structure .",
    "rather , we describe here a numerically tractable model that includes the geometry of the qd _",
    "molecules _ under study as well as static electric fields and works with a few meaningful parameters that characterize the structure . in particular , we compute the single - particle states , i. e. , wave functions and energies of the double qd molecules from the states of the two underlying single qds that make up the molecule . in the following ,",
    "we assume that the qd molecules are formed from two vertically stacked qds , separated by a spacer layer , such as one of the three double layers sketched in fig .",
    "[ figure1a ] .",
    "we assume that the qd molecules are embedded in a quantum well , and take the qw continuum states as plane waves that are orthogonalized to the localized states of the qd molecule , see ref .  .    for the qds",
    "we assume that they are grown on a wetting layer embedded in a quantum well .",
    "we use the envelope - function approximation and assume a cylindrical confinement potential of finite depth which yields semi - analytical results for the wave functions and energies .",
    "this approach is described in detail in appendix  [ app_dot ] .",
    "we stress that , although no strain , piezoelectric effects or structural anisotropies are included in the single qd model , its parameters are adjusted to more accurate @xmath2 qd calculations  @xcite with material parameters as used in ref .  .",
    "we start with the description of the two separate qds that will be combined to the double - qd molecule .",
    "since the qd molecule should be asymmetric , we identify the single qds as the `` small '' and the `` large '' one .",
    "for the small qd , we assume an in@xmath3ga@xmath4as qd embedded in a gaas quantum well on a wetting layer of thickness 1 nm .",
    "the qd has a diameter of 10 nm and a height of 2 nm . for this qd geometry only the lowest electron and hole states are confined . for the large qd",
    ", we assume an in@xmath5ga@xmath6as qd embedded in a gaas quantum well on a wetting layer of thickness 1 nm .",
    "the cylindrical qd model has a diameter of 12 nm and a height of 3 nm . for this structure three electron and three hole states are confined .",
    "the different sized qds have different energy spacings between the levels . in particular , no energetic degeneracies between levels of the small and the large qd occurs .",
    ".electron ( e ) and hole ( h ) energies of single - particle states in the qd molecules . the bonding and antibonding states formed from hole levels of the individual qds",
    "are denoted by h@xmath7 and h@xmath8 , respectively . [ cols=\"<,^,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      for the single qd",
    "we first investigate peak gain and peak slowdown as done in figure  [ figure3 ] by comparing a lattice temperature of @xmath9  k with a lattice temperature of 300k . for the calculation of the gain and the slow down factor , we use the semiconductor bloch equations ( [ p - ab])([n - b ] ) including a microscopic scattering and dephasing contribution as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : corcontr ] .",
    "the peak gain and peak slowdown vs.  drive intensity are shown in figure [ figure10_2 ] . below a drive intensity of 0.1mw/@xmath10",
    "we find a significant peak absorption without peak - slowdown for both lattice temperatures . above a drive intensity of 0.1mw/@xmath10 the peak slowdown factor for similar peak absorption values",
    "is higher for lower temperatures . this result",
    "again is obtained because the average phonon occupation is reduced for lower temperatures , and a smaller carrier - phonon dephasing rate results for all polarizations .",
    "this reduction is proportionally less pronounced for the _ interband _ and proportionally more pronounced for the _ quantum coherence_. the dephasing processes of the quantum coherence which are associated with real carrier - phonon scattering transitions are significantly reduced . these processes",
    "no longer dominate over carrier - carrier and pure - dephasing carrier - phonon processes of the quantum coherence .",
    "but an effectively long dephasing time for ( realistic ) slow light applications is still not reached .",
    "finally we compare the results of the qd molecule and the deep single qd for a lattice temperature of @xmath9  k. in figure [ figure10_3 ] the peak gain and peak slowdown versus drive intensity is plotted for both setups .",
    "a tremendous improvement of the peak slowdown factor for similar peak absorptions values for the qd molecule compared to the deep single qd is visible .",
    "this improvement can be explained in the following way : the negligible wave - function overlap between the states of the e@xmath11 transition of the @xmath1 system in the qd molecule has a huge influence on the electron - phonon _ and electron - electron _ dephasing contributions of the quantum coherence .",
    "this influence reduces the dephasing rate of the quantum coherence much more than the dephasing rate of the interband probe polarization .",
    "therefore , the comparison between the results of single qds and qd molecules shows , that an effectively long dephasing time can only be engineered by using suitable qd _",
    "in this paper we presented a microscopic analysis of quantum coherence schemes , in particular electromagnetically induced transparency and group - velocity slowdown , in a special double - qd molecule design .",
    "we incorporated scattering and dephasing effects , including polaronic effects in qds , into the equations of motion for the relevant polarizations and distribution functions .",
    "we used a quasi - analytic model for qd single - particle states with parameters adjusted to the results of @xmath2-calculations for a realistic ingaas - based qd .",
    "the design of the double - qd molecule was geared towards achieving a long - lived quantum coherence in a @xmath1 scheme involving two electronic levels localized at the individual qds and a delocalized hole level .",
    "starting from the quasi - analytic qd model we constructed the states of the qd molecule and used these as input in the equations of motion for polarizations and distribution functions . choosing probe and drive fields suitable for a @xmath1 scheme consisting of the delocalized hole level and the two localized electron levels , we found cw slowdown factors and slowdown - bandwidth products of the qd molecule that are far better than our previous results on  @xmath0 schemes or results achieved by @xmath1 schemes in single qds as presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : results_single ] .",
    "we further combined the microscopic material equations with a numerical calculation of the propagating probe pulse and showed that a clear separation of the slowed down pulse with a reference pulse can be achieved over distances of a few @xmath12 with acceptable pulse distortion and absorption .",
    "we emphasize that this result was made possible by the design of the qd molecule that yields a comparatively long dephasing time on the quantum coherence .",
    "importantly , the dephasing contributions that largely determine the figures of merit for the slowdown were not taken as constant rates , but arose from the microscopic treatment of the underlying interaction processes for a sufficiently realistic qd model .",
    "this work was supported in part by sandia s solid - state lighting science center , an energy frontier research center ( efrc ) funded by the us department of energy , office of science , office of basic energy sciences .",
    "this appendix gives details of our calculation of the wave functions and energies of qd molecules .",
    "since we are interested in the qualitative properties of qd molecules , and wish to be able to easily describe the structural parameters ( i.e. different qd sizes and distances between the two qds ) , we use a simple and semi - analytical approximation for the description of the qds contained in the qd molecules . we stress that no band - mixing due to strain or piezoelectric effects",
    "are included , but the parameters used in the model have been chosen to compare well to a qd calculated by @xmath13-theory .",
    "we assume a cylindrical qd with a confinement potential of depth . for the hamiltonian of the cylindrical qd in envelope approximation we use@xmath14 where the laplacian  @xmath15 and @xmath16are expressed in cylindrical coordinates .",
    "the heights of the qd in @xmath17 direction is @xmath18 , the diameter is @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the depth of the confinement potential .",
    "the wave function @xmath21 of the schroedinger equation @xmath22has to be understood as an envelope function and @xmath23 as an effective mass .",
    "we assume that the height is much smaller than the diameter of the qd .",
    "therefore the electrons and holes are strongly localized in the growth direction  @xmath17 .",
    "if we assume the separability of the wave function for the in - plane and the @xmath17  direction , the three dimensional schroedinger equation reduces to a two and an one dimensional problem .",
    "thus we can write for the wave function @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a normalization constant .",
    "furthermore we used in @xmath17 direction @xmath26 and the corresponding approximation for the in - plane direction to obtain a self - consistent set of equations .    for the schroedinger equation in @xmath17 direction",
    "we have @xmath27 \\phi_{\\perp } ( z)=e_{\\perp } \\phi _ { \\perp } ( z)\\ ] ] here , @xmath28 is an effective one - dimensional potential that contains the in - plane kinetic energy @xmath29 which , in turn , depends on the in - plane eigen - energy  @xmath30 .",
    "since these kinetic energies @xmath31 are not known , we use an iteration procedure to calculate the in - plane and @xmath17 eigen - energies .",
    "we start the iteration by setting @xmath32 equal to @xmath33 . for the solution we obtain for the symmetric eigenstates @xmath34 and for the antisymmetric eigenstates",

    "we obtain the eigenvalues @xmath44    for the schroedinger equation in the in - plane direction we have @xmath45 \\\\   & + \\tilde{v}_{\\parallel}\\theta(b - r)\\big ] \\phi _ { \\parallel } ( r,\\varphi ) = e_{\\parallel } \\phi _ { \\parallel } ( r,\\varphi ) \\end{split } \\label{2dschroedinger_cylinderqd}\\ ] ] the effective potential @xmath46 again includes a contribution from the kinetic energy in growth - direction , which depends on the solution of the eigenvalue problem in @xmath17 direction , @xmath47 .",
    "we start the iteration by setting @xmath48 equal to @xmath33 . because of the symmetry of the potential around the growth direction , the hamiltonian commutes with the components of the angular momentum operator ( @xmath49 = 0 $ ] ) .",
    "therefore the two dimensional schroedinger equation for the angular momentum projection quantum number @xmath50 reduces to an effective one dimensional schroedinger equation . resorting the terms we obtain @xmath51 \\tilde{\\phi}_{\\parallel } ( r )   = e_{\\parallel } \\tilde{\\phi}(r ) \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 this equation can be cast into the form of a bessel differential equation . a solution of this differential equation inside the qd is the bessel function in @xmath23-th order of the first kind @xmath53",
    ". therefore we obtain inside the qd @xmath54a solution outside the qd is the modified bessel function @xmath55 .",
    "therefore we obtain outside the qd @xmath56at @xmath57 , the wave function @xmath58 and @xmath59 have to be continuous . with @xmath60 and @xmath61 ,",
    "the continuity condition yields @xmath62 all @xmath63 between @xmath64 and @xmath65 with @xmath66 are allowed . for the eigenvalues of the two dimensional problem we obtain @xmath67 in summary we have energy levels @xmath68 and wave functions @xmath69 with the quantum numbers @xmath70 and @xmath23 .",
    "the states with different @xmath23 and the same @xmath70 are degenerate .    for the approximate solution of the three dimensional problem we have to solve the one- and two - dimensional eigenvalues in a self - consistent fashion by determining the updated potentials for the next iteration step from the eigen - energies of the previous iteration .",
    "the procedure is quite efficient , and one obtains converged eigenvalues @xmath71 and wave functions @xmath72 for the pillbox - shaped qd after only a few iteration steps .",
    "the resulting energies and wave functions , obtained using optimized effective parameters , have been checked against k@xmath73p - calculations ,  @xcite which include strain and piezoelectric effects .      after introducing the pillbox model for the electronic structure of qds",
    ", we now couple these qds to molecules . for this purpose",
    "we introduce an ansatz similar to the linear combination of atomic orbitals .    for a detailed description of the calculation",
    "we assume a qd molecule consisting of two qds , labeled @xmath74 and @xmath75 . for qd @xmath74 and @xmath75",
    "we assume @xmath25 and @xmath76 bound states respectively .",
    "further , for the uncoupled qds , we label the wave functions @xmath77 and @xmath78 , the eigenvalues @xmath79 and @xmath80 and the potential @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively . to determine the envelope wave functions @xmath83 , and the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath84 , of the electronically coupled qds we use a superposition of the following form @xmath85 with the hamiltonian @xmath86we",

    "@xcite because in this case matrix  @xmath95 is invertible , its possible to reduce the generalized eigenvalue problem to an ( ordinary ) eigenvalue problem .",
    "therefore we have to solve @xmath96 \\binom{c_{1}^{n}}{c_{2}^{m}}=e\\binom{c_{1}^{n}}{c_{2}^{m } } \\label{qdm6}\\ ] ] the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of this equation have to be understood as the single - particle result for the electronic structure of the qd molecule , which can then be used as input in the many - particle semiconductor bloch equations .",
    "furthermore we want to consider an sufficiently weak external electric field , i.e. , an electric field that can be included in the lcao calculation of the qd molecules . for electrons ,",
    "one includes in the potential @xmath97 in   a contribution from the electric field @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the electric field . for holes , the sign of the electric potential",
    "is reversed .",
    "the results of this semi - analytical approach for qd molecules without electric field were again checked against k@xmath73p - calculation .  @xcite the approach was found to yield a qualitatively correct description of the electronic structure of the qd molecules studied in this paper .",
    "we investigate a qd / qd molecule of the ensemble with @xmath100 electron and @xmath101 hole states embedded in a quantum well .",
    "we make a single - band approximation for the quantum well and assume that all electron and hole states are spin or pseudo - spin degenerate , respectively .",
    "so every state in the qd / qd molecule can be labeled by @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the band index , @xmath104 @xmath105 .",
    "states in the quantum well are labeled by @xmath106 .",
    "thus we introduce the notation @xmath107 with @xmath108 for all states . with this unified index @xmath109 a simplification of the carrier - phonon interaction matrix - elements @xmath110 and",
    "the carrier - carrier interaction matrix - elements @xmath111 follows .    with the derivation described in section [ sec : corcontr ] and a generalized notation @xmath112 for the density matrix we obtain for dephasing and scattering processes due to the carrier - phonon interaction in markov approximation the following set of equations @xmath113 where @xmath114 here , we have used the abbreviation @xmath115 , and , as discussed in connection with equation , @xmath116 is a complex single - particle energy with an energy shift @xmath117 and a damping @xmath118 , which represents an energetic broadening and thus a finite quasi - particle lifetime due to the electron - phonon interaction .",
