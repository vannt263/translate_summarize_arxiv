    "the microquasar grs  1915@xmath0105  is one of the most interesting galactic sources of radio , infrared , and x - ray emission .",
    "it was first discovered as a transient x - ray source by _ granat _ in 1992 @xcite , and later was observed to emit highly relativistic radio jets with intrinsic velocities greater than 0.9c @xcite .",
    "high optical extinction has prevented studies of the binary companion of grs  1915@xmath0105 , and there is no known orbital period or mass function for the system .",
    "however , the x - ray luminosity of grs  1915@xmath0105  greatly exceeds the eddington luminosity for a neutron star ( greiner , morgan , and remillard 1996 ) , and the other galactic sources of highly relativistic ( @xmath1c ) jets , gro  j1655@xmath240  @xcite and v4641  sgr @xcite , have mass functions greater than the maximum mass for a neutron star , 3 m@xmath3 .",
    "grs  1915@xmath0105  is therefore thought to be a black hole binary system .",
    "the properties of microquasars in the galaxy are reviewed by @xcite .",
    "although grs  1915@xmath0105  is often noted for exhibiting x - ray , radio , and infrared emission which is variable on time scales of seconds to minutes @xcite , the source also exhibits steady emission which is reminiscent of black hole candidates such as cyg  x@xmath21  and gx  339@xmath24 . both the steady and variable emission from grs  1915@xmath0105  exhibit two ( muno , morgan , & remillard 1999 ; rao , yadav , & paul 2000 ) or three @xcite basic modes of x - ray emission . in the two - state description ,",
    "the hard state resembles the very high state of canonical black hole binaries ( morgan , remillard , & greiner 1997 ) , as it exhibits x - ray flux with a power - law spectrum above 40 kev , prominent thermal emission from the accretion disk below @xmath4  kev , and a strong ( up to 15% rms ) 0.510 hz quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) .",
    "conversely , the soft state of grs  1915@xmath0105  exhibits little x - ray emission above 40 kev and no 0.510 hz qpo , although a stationary 67 hz qpo and several low frequency ( @xmath5 hz ) qpos are often observed during this state .",
    "long - term radio and x - ray monitoring of grs  1915@xmath0105   @xcite has revealed that periods of hard , steady x - ray emission are often accompanied by bright , optically thick radio emission .",
    "this has been dubbed the `` plateau state '' by foster et al .",
    "( 1996 ; see also fender 2001 ) .",
    "the radio plateau emission in grs  1915@xmath0105  resembles steady , optically thick radio emission observed coincident with hard x - ray emission in the black hole candidates cyg  x@xmath21  @xcite , gx  339@xmath24  @xcite , and cyg  x@xmath23  @xcite .",
    "the connection between the x - ray and radio emission in grs  1915@xmath0105  is illustrated in figure  [ asm ] , where we plot the intensity as a function of time as observed in soft x - rays by the all - sky monitor ( asm ) aboard the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ; first panel ) , and at radio wavelengths by the ryle telescope ( 15.2 ghz ; third panel ) .",
    "we also plot the the asm hardness ratio hr2 ( 5 - 12 kev / 3 - 5 kev ; second panel ) , and the radio spectral index @xmath6 taken from monitoring data at 2.25 and 8.3 ghz from the green bank interferometer ( i.e. @xmath7 ; only observations where @xmath8 at both wavelengths are greater than 20 mjy are plotted ) .",
    "bright radio plateau emission and hard - steady x - ray emission is evident on several occasions ( e.g. mjd  5073050750 ) , yet the radio emission is sometimes a factor of 10 fainter during other hard x - ray states ( e.g. mjd  5045050550 ) .",
    "observations with the very long baseline array during the plateau state reveal that the optically thick radio emission originates in a compact jet on order 10 au across ( dhawan , mirabel , & rodrguez 2000 ) .",
    "the radio plateau state is of further interest because it is often preceded and/or followed by optically thin radio flares in grs  1915@xmath0105  @xcite , as are similar hard - steady states with optically thick radio emission in gx  339@xmath24  @xcite and cyg  x@xmath23  @xcite .",
    "the optically thin emission in grs  1915@xmath0105  originates from relativistic ejections of synchrotron - emitting blobs detached from the central source @xcite . in figure  [ asm ] ,",
    "optically thin radio flares precede and terminate the radio plateau emission which occurred between mjd  5073050750 , while weaker flares with shorter duration terminate the long period of weaker radio emission from mjd  5045050550 .",
    "these events are associated with flares in the asm light curve , which suggests that the most powerful jets are associated with instabilities in the inner accretion disk .",
    "moreover , there have been several occasions in which weaker radio and infrared flares recur at @xmath930 minute intervals , and are preceded by distinctive dip and flare patterns in x - rays @xcite .    during the plateau state of grs  1915@xmath0105",
    ", the radio luminosity is low compared to the large optically thin flares , but the power in the radio jets may still represent a significant fraction of the accretion energy inferred from the x - ray emission @xcite . since this emission originates from a compact jet within 10 au of the central source and",
    "is present only during the hard x - ray state , it seems very likely that the compact jet is influenced by the properties of the inner accretion flow , and vice versa .",
    "this has led @xcite to suggest that the hard x - rays originate from inverse compton scattering of seed photons at the base of the compact jet of relativistic electrons .",
    "this idea motivates further efforts to compare the properties of the radio emission to the x - ray spectral and timing information during the hard state of grs  1915@xmath0105 .",
    "the timing properties of grs  1915@xmath0105  provide a promising means of probing the accretion flow near the black hole .",
    "in particular , the 0.510  hz qpo observed during the hard state appears to provide a link between the optically thick accretion disk and the comptonizing electrons , because ( 1 ) the frequency of the qpo increases as the thermal flux from the disk increases ( chen , taam & swank 1997 ; trudolyubov , churazov , & gilfanov 1999 ; markwardt , swank , & taam 1999 ) , ( 2 ) the spectrum of the qpo amplitude is hard , indicating an origin in the power law component of the spectrum @xcite , and ( 3 ) the qpo is only present when the power - law component of the x - ray spectrum is strong , while it is absent when the power - law component is weak @xcite .",
    "additional timing characteristics , such as the fourier phase lags and the coherence function , may further constrain the relationship between hard and soft x - ray components . @xcite",
    "have found that the signs of the phase lags change from positive to negative as the frequency of the 0.510 hz qpo increases , which has provided impetus for others ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to develop models describing the structure of the comptonizing corona and how it is related to the optically thick accretion disk .    in this paper",
    ", we use a complete sample of `` hard - steady '' observations of grs  1915@xmath0105  ( referred to as the @xmath10 state by belloni et al .",
    "2000 ) to examine in detail the connection between the hard , steady x - ray emission and the steady radio emission .",
    "first , we establish that the hard - steady x - ray states of grs  1915@xmath0105  always exhibit detectable radio emission . however , the intensities of the 2200  kev x - ray and 15.2 ghz radio flux are not correlated , so we proceed to examine whether there are more subtle relationships between the spectrum and timing properties of the x - ray emission and the intensity and spectrum of the radio emission .",
    "we investigate these correlations in three different manners : first , by describing in detail the properties of three characteristic observations , then by displaying the time evolution of the timing properties during periods of both faint and bright radio emission , and lastly by examining the timing properties as a function of the radio flux density .",
    "the ryle telescope at the mullard radio astronomy observatory , cambridge , is primarily used for microwave - background measurements , but during gaps in that program it has been used to monitor variable galactic and extra - galactic sources .",
    "it operates at 15.2 ghz , and uses a single set of linearly - polarized feeds . in good observing conditions ,",
    "the rms noise in a 1 minute integration is about 3.5 mjy . since the measurements are unbiased , the noise level decreases as the square root of the observing time .",
    "details of the observing and analysis routine are given in @xcite .",
    "we have averaged the radio measurements in two ways for the purposes of this paper .",
    "we have used the averaged daily flux density measured with the ryle telescope when displaying monitoring light curves of grs  1915@xmath0105  ( e.g. figure  [ asm ] ) . when comparing the ryle measurements to the properties",
    "of pointed _ rxte _",
    "observations , we have averaged data taken within 0.5 days before and after the _ rxte _  observation in order to sample the radio properties which most closely correspond to the x - ray observation ( see table  [ rxte ] ) .",
    "monitoring with the green bank interferometer has been performed simultaneously at 2.25 and 8.3 ghz on a 2.4 km baseline with 35 mhz bandwidth and dual circular polarization .",
    "most scans are 10 - 15 minute integrations , and the calibration procedure is described by @xcite .",
    "random ( one sigma ) errors in the gbi data are flux dependent : 4 mjy ( 2 ghz ) or 6 mjy ( 8 ghz ) for fluxes @xmath11 mjy , 15 mjy ( 2 ghz ) or 50 mjy ( 8 ghz ) for fluxes @xmath12 jy .",
    "in addition , systematic errors are introduced by atmospheric and hardware effects , which we estimate may approach 10% at 2 ghz and 20% at 8 ghz , occasionally higher for extreme local hour angles .",
    "flux density measurements below 20 mjy approach the noise level of the instruments , and therefore we do not include measurements below this level in our analysis .    as with the ryle data , daily gbi measurements have been averaged when producing monitoring light curves , and gbi data taken within 0.5 days of a pointed _ rxte _  observation have been averaged when comparing individual observations ( table  [ rxte ] ) . in both cases , we also have computed the spectral index @xmath6 from the average flux in the 2.25 and 8.3 ghz bands .      the vla is a multi - frequency , multi - configuration aperture synthesis imaging instrument , consisting of 27 antennas of 25 m diameter .",
    "the receivers at 1.42 , 5.0 , 8.45 , and 15.2 ghz , have been used on various occasions , with 2 adjacent bands of 50 mhz nominal bandwidth processed in continuum mode .",
    "the corresponding 1-sigma sensitivities in 10 minutes are 0.06 , 0.06 , 0.05 , and 0.2 mjy respectively .",
    "switching between multiple frequencies takes about 30 s. the array configuration is varied every 4 months to cycle between 4 sets , a , b , c , and d , with maximum baselines of about 36 , 11 , 3.4 , and 1 km .",
    "observations of grs  1915@xmath0105  while in its radio faint state have been obtained from the public archive in order to constrain the radio spectrum .",
    "the observations we have found are listed in table  [ vla ] , along with mean fluxes from ryle and gbi observations taken within a half day of the vla observations .",
    "for all of the observations reported here , grs  1915@xmath0105  was unresolved by the synthesized beam ( see table  [ vla ] ) in any configuration at any wavelength .",
    "other sources in the field of view ( mainly at 1.4 ghz ) are well separated in the images , so there is no confusion with grs  1915@xmath0105 .",
    "calibration and imaging were carried out with standard tasks in the nrao aips ( astronomical image processing system ) package .",
    "for all of these observations , the phase calibrator was 1925@xmath0211 .",
    "the primary flux density calibrator was 3c286 ( 1328@xmath0307 ) for all observations except 1996 november 14 , when 3c48 ( 0134@xmath0329 ) was used .",
    "in practice , the flux density errors are not set by the rms receiver ( thermal ) noise stated above , but by errors in the flux density scale , estimated to be 3 - 5% of the measurement , and/or source variability , depending on the occasion .",
    "more details of the vla are given in the observational status summary ( http://www.aoc.nrao.edu/vla/obstatus/vlas/vlas.html ) , and the data reduction is treated in formal detail in taylor , carilli , & perley ( 1999 ) and in the vla cookbook ( http://www.cv.nrao.edu/aips/cook.html ) .",
    "the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) consists of three instruments : the all - sky monitor ( asm ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the proportional counter array ( pca ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the high energy timing experiment ( hexte ; * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ asm ] shows the asm light curve of grs  1915@xmath0105  along with daily radio measurements from ryle and the spectral index from the gbi .",
    "there is no apparent correlation between the radio emission and the asm count rate , although there is some correlation with the asm hardness ratio hr2 ( 5 - 12 kev / 3 - 5 kev ) .",
    "in addition , there has been a long campaign of weekly observations with with the pca and hexte , which we use to study the detailed timing and spectral properties of the hard emission from grs  1915@xmath0105 .",
    "we define intervals as `` hard - steady '' if the ratio of the mean pca count rates in the 1260 kev to the 212 kev bands exceeds 0.05 and the mean variability in the count rate ( 260 kev ) at 1s time intervals is less than 12% for an _ rxte _  orbit ( typically 3000  s ) . in figure  [ asm ]",
    "we have marked the pointed _ rxte _",
    "observations of the hard - steady state with vertical bars above the asm light curve , and we have listed them in table  [ rxte ] .",
    "the small dots represent the remainder of the pointed observations .",
    "we have analyzed all 113 observations of grs  1915@xmath0105  in the hard steady state taken with _",
    "rxte _  between 1996 april 15 ( mjd  50188 ) through 1999 march 22 ( mjd  51259 ) , during the time interval for the pca instrument gain setting known as `` epoch 3 '' . in order to improve the signal - to - noise of the spectral and timing measurements whenever possible , if the variability in the mean count rate in 16 s bins is less than 5% during a single day , we have analyzed all of the data for that day together",
    "otherwise , we have grouped the data while remaining within the 5% variability limit ( 16 s bins ) , with the smallest unit being a single _ rxte _  orbit .    for each time unit , we have integrated 128-channel energy spectra ( `` standard2 '' ) data from pcus 0 and 1 of the pca , and 64 channel ( archive mode ) spectra from both clusters of hexte . in order to calculate the flux from grs 1915 + 105 , we have fit the spectra with the phenomenological model described in @xcite .",
    "the model consists of the sum of a multi - color blackbody , a power law ( with a high - energy cutoff when necessary ) , and a gaussian line ( representing iron emission between 57 kev ) .",
    "interstellar absorption is taken into account assuming a column density equivalent to @xmath13 @xmath14 .",
    "a normalization factor is allowed to account for differences in the effective area of the pcus and the hexte clusters which are not taken into account by the response matrices .",
    "the standard ftools 4.2 background subtraction algorithm for bright sources has been applied to the data , and a systematic uncertainty of 1% has been added to each spectral bin .",
    "we have computed an x - ray flux for each observation , by summing the bolometric flux implied by multi - temperature disk model ( @xmath15 ) , the flux in the power law between 2200 kev ( @xmath16 de$ ] ) , and the flux in the iron line ( @xmath17 de$ ] ) .",
    "we also have created power density spectra ( pds ) and cross spectra ( cs ) for each 256 s interval of data with @xmath18 s time resolution and four energy channels , using combinations of the binned and event modes for each observation .",
    "the four energy channels used are as follows : 24.3 kev ( henceforth referred to as the `` low energy '' band ) , 4.37.8 kev , 7.811.5 kev , and 11.560 kev ( referred to as the `` high energy '' band ) .",
    "the pds and cs have been averaged for the entire time unit ( an _ rxte _  orbit or an observation , as defined above ) and logarithmically re - binned .",
    "the pds have been corrected for dead - time effects and poisson noise @xcite , and have been normalized to the fractional rms squared per hz . to quantify the features of the pds , we have fit pds from each energy band with a model consisting of a power law with two breaks and lorentzians for any qpos present in the pds .",
    "we have searched for the 67 hz qpo during each of these hard - steady observations using data with @xmath19 s time resolution in a single energy channel , but we did not detect it .",
    "typical upper limits range from 0.10.5% ( 1 @xmath20 ) .",
    "the coherence function and phase lags have been calculated from the cs in the manner described in @xcite .",
    "we have used the standard convention that `` hard '' or `` positive '' lags indicate that higher energy photons lag behind lower energy photons .",
    "the uncertainties have been calculated for the case of high signal power and high measured coherence , using an estimate of the dead - time - corrected poisson noise @xcite .",
    "if the signal power is smaller than the estimated noise , or if the coherence is less than the noise divided by the signal , we do not plot either the phase lags or the coherence functions .",
    "guided by the long - term monitoring light curves in figure  [ asm ] , we have defined subsets of the hard - steady observations based upon the radio emission from grs  1915@xmath0105  in order to facilitate the comparison between the radio and x - ray emission .",
    "we have defined `` radio plateau '' hard - steady conditions for observations for which grs  1915@xmath0105  is brighter than 20 mjy at 15.2 ghz , and exhibits a flat radio spectrum with index ( measured from the daily average of the flux ) @xmath21 .",
    "we also have defined `` radio steep '' conditions for observations when grs  1915@xmath0105  is brighter than 20 mjy at 15.2 ghz , and exhibits a optically thin radio spectrum with index @xmath22 .",
    "figure  [ asm ] demonstrates that the radio steep conditions typically represent the transition into and out of periods of radio plateau emission , and occur during the decays of large optically thin radio flares ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our discussion of radio steep observations will be limited , as the optically thin emission probably results from radio ejecta that could evolve independently of the instantaneous x - ray conditions on 0.5 day time scales .    finally , we have defined `` radio - faint '' conditions for those hard - steady x - ray observations for which the daily average of the radio flux at 15.2 ghz is less than 20 mjy , because for these observations the radio flux at the gbi frequencies is too low to reliably measure a spectral index .",
    "the radio faint conditions occur with two variants those observations for which the x - ray emission is bright , and those for which it is faint .",
    "the behavior of the timing properties with respect to the radio emission is similar for both variants , although the shape of the x - ray spectrum and the values of the timing properties ( e.g. the qpo frequency and the phase lags ) are distinctive , and warrant a separate discussion .",
    "we first investigate 1 ) whether all of the hard - steady observations are coincident with radio emission , 2 ) whether the x - ray and radio flux are correlated , and 3 ) how the radio conditions ( plateau , steep , and faint ) are distributed in a plot of radio vs. x - ray flux .",
    "figure  [ rvx ] displays a plot of the radio flux density at 15.2 ghz ( log scale ) versus the 2200  kev x - ray flux for each of the hard - steady observations .",
    "it is clear that all hard steady observations have radio flux densities greater than 2 mjy .",
    "panel 3 of figure  [ asm ] shows that the radio flux from grs  1915@xmath0105  does drop below 1 mjy ( e.g. mjd  5082550875 ) , but such intervals are associated with the soft x - ray state .",
    "radio emission always accompanies the hard - steady x - ray state _ , although a note of caution is appropriate for those observations associated with variable , optically thin radio emission , as noted above .",
    "however , figure  2 also shows the radio and x - ray fluxes are not correlated in the hard - steady state .",
    "likewise , we have found that the total 50 - 100 kev flux , the power law flux , and the thermal ( multi - color disk ) flux are not correlated with the strength of the radio emission ( not shown ) .",
    "the radio conditions are represented in figure  [ rvx ] as follows : radio plateau observations are plotted as triangles , radio steep as circles , and radio faint as @xmath23 s .",
    "observations for which the gbi spectral index has not been measured are plotted only with error bars .",
    "the plot can be roughly split into four quadrants .",
    "the radio plateau observations are clearly localized in the upper left quadrant , with @xmath24 mjy and @xmath25 erg @xmath26 s@xmath27 .",
    "some radio steep observations are also present in this quadrant .",
    "the upper right quadrant contains radio steep observations and observations for which no spectral index is available from the gbi .",
    "these latter observations were taken between mjd  5031350320 ( before the current gbi monitoring program ) , a time interval which is included in the analysis of @xcite . during this time",
    "span a large radio flare occurred terminating a plateau state , and the radio flux density at 1.4 ghz was consistently larger than that at 3.3 ghz , which suggests that these points should be classified as radio steep .",
    "therefore , the upper right quadrant ( @xmath24 mjy and @xmath28 erg @xmath26 s@xmath27 ) appears to include only radio steep observations , during which the radio and x - ray emission may vary independently since the radio measurements may be dominated by the evolution of an expanding jet detached from the central source . for this reason , we choose to ignore the upper right quadrant .",
    "the lower quadrants , with @xmath29 mjy , contain radio faint observations by construction . after examining the temporal clustering of these radio - faint observations",
    ", we feel that it is useful also to consider them in two quadrants : an x - ray faint quadrant with @xmath25 erg @xmath26 s@xmath27 , and an x - ray bright quadrant with @xmath28 erg @xmath26 s@xmath27 .",
    "this separation is further motivated by their differing energy spectral and timing properties , which are described in the next section .",
    "from each of the three quadrants under consideration from the radio versus x - ray flux plane ( figure  [ rvx ] ) , we have selected a characteristic observation in order to illustrate the range of x - ray spectral and timing properties within the hard - steady x - ray state . in figures",
    "[ spec ] , [ pdsetc ] , and [ vsspec ] , the left panel is a radio faint , x - ray faint observation ( mjd  50488 ; 1997 february 9 ) ; the center panel is a radio plateau , x - ray faint observation ( mjd  50737 ; 1997 october 16 ) ; and the right panel is a radio faint , x - ray bright observation ( mjd  50708 ; 1997 september 17 ) . the radio and x - ray fluxes from these three observations",
    "are indicated in figure  [ rvx ] .",
    "figure  [ spec ] illustrates the results of the spectral fits for the three representative observations with differing values of the radio and x - ray flux .",
    "the spectrum in the left panel is from a radio faint observation when the x - ray emission was also relatively faint ( @xmath30erg @xmath26 s@xmath27 ) .",
    "the soft emission during this observation can be modeled ( @xmath31 ) using a cool multi - temperature blackbody with an apparent inner disk temperature of @xmath32 kev and an apparent radius of @xmath334080 km ( assuming a distance of 11 kpc and an inclination angle of 66@xmath34 ; see fender et al .",
    "the power law has a photon index @xmath35 and requires an exponential cutoff at about 70 kev .",
    "the results of this spectral fit are characteristic of observations during which both the x - ray and radio flux were low .",
    "the spectrum in the middle panel is from an observation which exhibited radio plateau conditions when the x - ray emission was also faint ( @xmath36 erg @xmath26 s@xmath27 ) . despite the similarity in x - ray flux to the left panel ,",
    "the shape of the x - ray spectrum is quite different .",
    "the thermal component of the model appears hot ( @xmath37 kev ) with a small apparent inner radius ( @xmath38 km ) .",
    "this quasi - thermal component is not consistent with simple models of reflection from an accretion disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is possible that this broad thermal bump represents emission from a relatively small area of the disk which has been heated by , for example , a magnetic flare ( di matteo , celotti , & fabian 1999 ) or a spiral shock wave @xcite , or that the disk develops an optically thick atmosphere which comptonizes the emergent spectrum , so that the spectral hardening and decreased apparent radius are illusory effects of increased scattering in a `` puffed up '' disk ( merloni , fabian , & ross 2000 ) .",
    "the photon index of the power law is @xmath39 , and a cut - off at about 80 kev is required for observations with longer integration times and hence better statistics at energies above 100 kev .",
    "we note that @xcite have presented a different model for spectra of grs  1915@xmath0105  such as these , consisting of a multi - temperature disk , a thermal - compton spectrum @xcite , and a power law .",
    "for the purposes of this paper , we prefer to use our simpler model with fewer free parameters .",
    "the right panel is from an observation when the radio emission was faint ( 6 mjy ) and the x - ray emission was bright ( @xmath40 erg @xmath26 s@xmath27 ) .",
    "the spectrum is similar to the radio bright , x - ray faint observation in the center panel , except that the relative contribution of the power law flux increases dramatically .",
    "the thermal component is hot ( @xmath41 kev ) and has a small apparent inner radius ( @xmath42 km ) , while the power law index is steep ( @xmath43 3.2 ) .",
    "the shape of the energy spectrum on 1997 september 17 is characteristic of all x - ray spectra from the hard state of grs  1915@xmath0105  when the total flux is greater than @xmath44 erg @xmath26 s@xmath27 .",
    "the count rate from grs  1915@xmath0105  tends to vary on time scales of hours when the source is bright in x - rays , so we only integrate spectra for individual _ rxte _  orbits . with these exposure times , we can measure the power law only up to about 100 kev .",
    "however , when we combine spectra with similar photon indices , we find that the data are consistent with no cut off in the power law below 200 kev .",
    "the changes in the x - ray spectrum clearly do not track the radio flux from grs  1915@xmath0105  in a monotonic manner .",
    "the power law component steepens dramatically as the radio emission increases in the x - ray faint state ( left and center panels of figure  [ spec ] ) , but is steepest when the x - ray emission is bright and the radio emission is faint ( right panel ) . at low x - ray fluxes ( @xmath45 erg @xmath26 s@xmath27 ) ,",
    "the thermal component is hot and has a small apparent inner radius during radio plateau observations , while it is cool and has a large apparent inner radius when the radio emission is faint ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "we have also indicated the break frequency in the 11.560  kev band with grey long - dashed lines ( see below ) . for the following discussion",
    "we define three frequency regions related for the features of the power spectrum : region  1 represents frequencies lower than the low frequency continuum break , region  2 frequencies between the low frequency break and the qpo frequency ( less its width ) , and region  3 frequencies higher than the qpo frequency ( or its harmonic if present ) .",
    "the first point of interest is that the qpo frequency is not strictly correlated with the x - ray flux from grs  1915@xmath0105 . from the spectra in figure  [ spec ] , it is clear that the x - ray flux increases from left to right , while in figure  [ pdsetc ] the qpo frequency is lowest in the center panel ( radio plateau conditions ) . in the following sections , we will demonstrate that the qpo frequency is always lowest during radio plateau conditions .",
    "the second and most obvious difference between the timing properties of these three observations is in the fourier phase lags . in region  2 ( between the low frequency break and the qpo ) ,",
    "the phase lags are negative when the radio emission is faint ( left and right panels ) , and positive during radio plateau emission ( center panels ; compare * ? ? ?",
    "this behavior is in sharp contrast to sources such as gx  339@xmath24  and cyg  x@xmath21 , for which the phase lags are always positive .",
    "only the phase lags during the radio plateau state resemble those of gx  339@xmath24  @xcite and cyg  x@xmath21  @xcite .",
    "the third notable result concerns the coherence function in region  1 ( i.e. frequencies lower than the first break )",
    ". the coherence function between the 11.560 kev and the 24.3 kev bands is lowest ( @xmath46 ) during the radio plateau conditions ( center panel ) , somewhat higher ( @xmath47 ) when both the radio and x - ray emission are faint ( left panel ) , and nearly unity when the radio emission is faint and the x - ray emission is bright ( right panel ) .",
    "only the latter case is reminiscent of cyg  x@xmath21  in its hard state @xcite .    finally , a comparison of the amplitude and strength of the power spectra as a function of energy reveals further differences in each of the three observations . while the radio emission is faint , ( right and left panels ) the root mean power at low frequencies is greater in the 11.560 kev energy band ( gray curve ) than in the 24.3 kev band ( black curve ) . however , during radio plateau conditions ( center panel ) the root mean power is nearly equal in all energy bands .",
    "the shape of the power spectrum also changes the low frequency break is strongest in the low energy band in the radio plateau observation ( center panel ) , while the break is most apparent in the high energy band in the radio faint , x - ray faint observation ( left panel ) .",
    "when the x - ray emission is bright , the low frequency break is evident in both energy bands ( right panel ) .",
    "there are several other interesting details in the timing properties presented in figure  [ pdsetc ] , although they are not directly relevant to the question of how the timing properties are related to the radio emission .",
    "the harmonic of the qpo tends to be strongest ( @xmath48% ) when count rate is lowest ( left and center panels ) , but is not apparent during x - ray bright observations ( right panel ) .",
    "a weak feature at approximately half of frequency of the strongest qpo peak is also evident during observations when both the x - ray and radio flux are faint ( right panel ) , with an rms amplitude of about @xmath491% and @xmath50 values of 110 .",
    "finally , a weak qpo is evident between 0.010.04 hz during a stretch of radio faint observations from mjd  5045040560 ( left panel ) , with an rms amplitude of about 0.1% in the 2 - 4.3 kev energy band .",
    "this low frequency qpo disappears at higher energies .",
    "its centroid frequency decreases as the frequency of the 0.510 hz qpo decreases ( not shown ) .",
    "since the 0.010.04 hz qpo is present only in the low energy band , the coherence function at the qpo frequency is near zero .",
    "the spectral fits which we have made to grs  1915@xmath0105  indicate that two spectral components are present ( figure  [ spec ] ) .",
    "most models of the emission from x - ray binaries invoke inverse - compton scattering to produce hard photons from soft seed photons , and consequently the variability in the hard and soft energy bands should be intimately related . however , before finalizing any conclusions regarding the phase lag and coherence measures and how these change with photon energy , we need to examine how these timing properties depend upon the amount of the flux which is contributed by each of the spectral components in the relevant energy bands .    in figure  [ vsspec ]",

    "it can be seen that the thermal component contributes no more than half of the flux in all energy bands for the observations which we analyze in this paper .",
    "examining next the top panels , we find that the presence of the thermal component does not greatly affect the rms power in a given energy band . in the second panels ,",
    "the slopes of the phase lags show no obvious breaks ; we might expect changes in the slopes if the soft and hard spectral components separately affected the phase lags . finally , while the fraction of the flux in the thermal component increases in a similar manner during the x - ray faint , radio plateau ( center panel ) and the x - ray faint , radio bright observation ( left panel ) , the coherence function at low frequencies plummets dramatically with increasing energy in the plateau observation ( center panel ) , but is near unity when the x - ray flux is bright ( right panel ) .",
    "we conclude that the changes in the timing properties are not related to the fraction of the emission which can be modeled with a thermal component .",
    "the evolution of the parameters of the power spectrum , phase lags , and coherence function can be viewed as a function of time during the long periods in which grs  1915@xmath0105  remains in the hard - steady state .",

    "four conclusions can be drawn from figure  [ ratfl ] regarding the changes in the timing properties as a function of the radio flux .",
    "the qpo frequency tends to decrease with increasing radio flux , and almost all of the observations with radio plateau conditions ( triangles ) have qpo frequencies less than 2  hz .",
    "second , during radio plateau hard - steady emission the hard photons _ lag _ the soft , while during radio faint ( @xmath23 s ) conditions the hard photons _ lead _ the soft .",
    "third , the coherence at low frequencies is lowest during radio plateau emission . finally , the ratio of low frequency power in 11.560 kev photons to the power in 24.3 kev photons is nearly unity only when the radio flux is largest , during radio plateau conditions .",
    "using our large dataset which incorporates a variety of radio conditions , we next examine correlations which other authors have reported to be well - defined . two studies @xcite have examined the frequency of the 0.510  hz qpo as a function of the pca count rate ( mjd  5027550333 ) and the 320 kev x - ray flux ( mjd  5036350563 ) , respectively .",
    "both have found significant correlations among these values . in the top panels of figure  [ qpocnt ] we plot the qpo frequency as a function of total x - ray flux ( defined in section  2.3 ; left panel ) , thermal flux ( middle panel ) , and power law flux ( right panel ) .",
    "we confirm that the frequency of the 0.510  hz qpo is tightly correlated with the x - ray flux from grs  1915@xmath0105 , but we also find that the correlations are not single - valued . in the left panel there",

    "the positive phase lags therefore appear to occur independently of any given x - ray flux level , and are better predicted by the presence of optically thick radio emission .",

    "the remainder of the observations in table  [ vla ] are x - ray faint .",
    "there is clear evidence in the gbi data for @xmath4930 mjy optically thin flares on 1996 december 28 , 1997 january 12 , and 1998 october 08 .",
    "the flares decay on time scales of several hours , and no _ rxte _",
    "observations were taken within 0.5 day of these flares . since gbi flux measurements below 20 mjy are uncertain , there remain two observations during which the vla observations demonstrate that the radio emission was faint and steady . on 1998",
    "september 14 , 15.2 ghz ryle and 5.0 ghz vla observations separated by 6 hours provide a spectral index @xmath55 , which suggests that the emission is optically thin . however , it is certainly possible that the radio flux varied by a few mjy during those several hours .",
    "dual frequency vla observations were made at 5.0 and 15.2 ghz on 1998 september 29 , which indicate @xmath56 .",
    "this suggests that the emission is optically thick , similar to a weak version of the radio plateau state .",
    "however , with only a single secure measurement of @xmath6 during the radio faint state , more observations are certainly warranted .",
    "we begin the discussion with a summary of our three hard - steady conditions :    * * radio faint * ( e.g. mjd  5045050550 ; mjd  50708 ) the radio emission has a mean flux density of about 5 mjy at 15.2 ghz . when the x - ray flux is faint ( @xmath57 erg @xmath26 s@xmath27 ) ,",
    "the x - ray spectrum is best described as the sum of a cool ( @xmath582  kev , @xmath59  km ) multi - temperature blackbody and a power law of index @xmath60 with a cut - off near 70 kev . when the x - ray emission is brighter ( @xmath61 erg @xmath26 s@xmath27 ) , the x - ray spectrum is best described with a hot ( @xmath622  kev ) multi - temperature black body and a steep power law ( @xmath63 ) without a cut off below 200 kev ( see section  2.2 ) . the qpo frequency is greater than 2  hz , phase lags are negative ( or , soft , indicating that hard photons precede soft photons ) at intermediate continuum frequencies , the coherence at low frequencies in the continuum is @xmath49 0.51.0 ( 11.560 kev compared to 24.3 kev ) , and there is much more low frequency power in the high energy band than the low energy band . * * radio plateau * ( e.g. mjd  5073050748 ) the radio emission is bright ( @xmath9100  mjy at 15  ghz ) and optically thick ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is best described by a hot multi - temperature black body ( @xmath37  kev and @xmath38  km ) and a power law ( @xmath64 ) which could be cut - off at @xmath65  kev .",
    "the qpo frequency reaches its lowest values ( @xmath66 hz ) , phase lags are positive ( hard photons lag soft photons ) , the coherence is low ( particularly at low frequencies ) , and there is about equal broad band rms power at low frequencies in all energy bands . * * radio steep * ( e.g mjd  50727 - 50730 ) these observations represent the transition into and out of radio plateau conditions .",
    "the radio flux is bright , while the radio spectrum is optically thin ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the x - ray flux is often higher than during radio plateau conditions , but the spectrum is still best described by a hot multi - temperature black body ( @xmath37  kev and @xmath42  km ) and a steep power law ( @xmath64 ) with a cut - off above 80  kev .",
    "the timing properties tend to be similar to radio faint conditions ( although there are exceptions ) : the qpo frequency is between 25  hz , the phase lags are negative , the coherence is around 0.5 , and there is more broad band power at low frequencies in the highest energy band .",
    "previous observations have established the nature of the bright radio emission from grs  1915@xmath0105 .",
    "the optically thick emission during plateau conditions has been resolved as a compact jet of relativistic electrons @xcite , similar to ones which may be present in cyg  x@xmath21  @xcite and gx  339@xmath24  @xcite .",
    "our observations of the faint radio emission provide some evidence that it is similar to a weak radio plateau state .",
    "radio flares with steep spectra originate from material which has been ejected from the central source @xcite , and so is most likely decoupled from the instantaneous conditions of the x - ray emitting regions . in the following discussion",
    "we will focus on comparing the radio faint and radio plateau conditions , during which the radio and x - ray properties of grs  1915@xmath0105  are closely related .",
    "the timing properties of grs  1915@xmath0105 the qpo frequency , phase lags , coherence function , and broad band noise appear to be highly dependent upon the radio conditions ( figure  [ ratfl ] ) .",
    "however , it is not immediately obvious whether the changes in the timing properties are part of the mechanism which produces a compact jet , or whether they result from changes in the accretion flow induced when the compact radio jet is strong . since the location and origin of the comptonizing electrons which generate hard x - rays is unknown , the possible connection between these and the jet is doubly uncertain .",
    "nevertheless , we may explore interpretations of these results using simple models for the accretion flow under consideration in the literature .    in section  4.1 , we consider the extent to which comptonization of a soft input signal by a static corona at the base of a compact radio jet is consistent with the phase lags and x - ray spectrum of grs  1915@xmath0105 . in sections  4.24.3 ,",
    "we examine two generic models which incorporate more elements of the accretion flow . in both models , cool ( @xmath67 kev )",
    "thermal emission originates from an optically thick accretion disk , while the hot power law component originates from inverse compton scattering .",
    "the first basic model places the comptonizing electrons in a spherical corona within the inner radius of the accretion disk , while the second geometry assumes that the relativistic electrons are part of a planar corona sustained by magnetic flares above the disk .",
    "hard phase lags are generic properties of the low - hard x - ray state of black hole candidates such as cyg  x@xmath21  @xcite and gx  339@xmath24  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the phase lags in grs  1915@xmath0105  change from negative to positive as the strength of the radio emission increases ( figure  [ ratfl]b ) . since",
    "@xcite have suggested that the comptonizing corona in the hard state of black hole candidates represents the base of a compact radio jet , we feel it is important to explore the possibility that the negative phase lags during radio faint observations of grs  1915@xmath0105  are intrinsic to the region close to the black hole , while the hard phase lags generated during the radio plateau state are due to the comptonization of the intrinsic input signal in a large corona at the base of the compact radio jet .",
    "the hard phase lags in grs  1915@xmath0105  may constrain the structure of the comptonizing region , because the phase is roughly constant as a function of frequency ( figure  [ pdsetc ] ) .",
    "this is contrary to the constant time lags that would be expected from a homogeneous corona .",
    "instead , @xcite and bttcher & liang ( 1999 ) have demonstrated that constant phase lags can be produced in an isotropically illuminated , spherical compton cloud with a uniform temperature and a density which decreases with radius as @xmath68 , since photons have an equal probability of scattering per decade of radius in such a cloud ( see nowak et al .",
    "1999b for further discussion of these models ) .",
    "high - frequency variability originates from photons which have scattered from small radii , since the signal is washed out if it scatters with long time delays . on the other hand ,",
    "the time lags of low - frequency signals are dominated by photons which have scattered over large radii .",
    "this produces time lags which decrease as a function of frequency , or phase lags which are nearly constant as a function of frequency .",
    "several authors have pointed out that the phase lags which are observed during the hard states of black hole candidates imply large scales for inverse compton scattering , which raises the question of how energy is transported to support a large , hot corona @xcite . in the plateau state of grs  1915@xmath0105 a phase lag of 0.5 radians at 0.3  hz ( middle panel of figure  [ pdsetc ] )",
    "would imply a light travel time of 0.3 s , or a distance of @xmath69 cm ( where @xmath70 is the optical depth of the corona ) .",
    "for a 10 m@xmath3  black hole , this represents thousands of schwarschild radii .",
    "however , this distance is much smaller than the size of the compact jet observed by dhawan et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , 10 au @xmath71 cm , which is consistent with the assumption that the comptonizing electrons reside at the base of the jet .",
    "if the compton cloud is the base of a compact jet , this reduces the difficulty in explaining how energy is transported to support a very large corona , as the jet may carry up to 10@xmath72 erg s@xmath27 of power to much larger radii @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the radio faint states are associated with a smaller compton corona located near the inner accretion disk . in this case ,",
    "negative phase lags could be caused by any number of effects intrinsic to the accretion disk , such as waves similar to those of @xcite which propagate outward in the disk rather than inward , or a modified form the of the magnetic flares of @xcite . even if a scattering corona intercepts a significant fraction of the photons from the disk , negative phase lags",
    "could be observed so long as 1 ) the scattering time in the corona is much smaller than the intrinsic time lags @xcite and 2 ) the differences between the energies of the seed photons and the observed signals are not too large ( which should be the case in grs  1915@xmath0105 , since the apparent disk temperature is @xmath73  kev ; nowak & vaughan 1996 ) .",
    "moreover , the radius of the compton corona can change without greatly affecting the slope and cut - off energy of the power law .",
    "the electron temperature ( @xmath74 ) of the corona is constrained to be nearly constant by the cut - off in the power law at 7080 kev measured during x - ray faint observations ( left and center panels of figure  [ spec ] ) .",
    "if the temperature of the corona is fixed , a steeper power law ( higher @xmath75 ) implies a lower optical depth ( see * ? ? ?",
    "since the power law is steeper during radio plateau observations ( @xmath64 ) than during the radio faint , x - ray faint observations ( @xmath60 ) , we can suggest that the optical depth of the corona decreases and its radius increases as the compact radio jet becomes more luminous .",
    "however , the x - ray bright , radio faint observations would then have a small , optically thin corona , since the phase lags are negative and the power law is steep ( @xmath63 ) during these observations ( figures  [ spec ] and [ pdsetc ] ) .",
    "the electron acceleration mechanism could be different in the x - ray bright hard state , as is hinted at by the absence of an observable cutoff in the power law below 200  kev .",
    "as others have noted , estimates of the lorentz factors for electrons emitting synchrotron emission ( @xmath76 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest energies that are much larger than that of the comptonizing electrons . one may consider the acceleration mechanism for the jet as an undetermined structure that draws material from the compton corona near the inner disk , as in @xcite . in the following two sections , we therefore briefly speculate on the implications which the simplest geometries for the compton corona described in the literature have on the jet production mechanism .",
    "many authors have suggested that a spherical corona is formed within the inner radius of an accretion disk , either as an advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; esin , mcclintock , & narayan 1997 ) , or by a shock in the accretion flow @xcite .",
    "the compact jet responsible for the radio emission could form from a wind emanating from an adaf @xcite or a post - shock region @xcite .",
    "the distinctive feature of the spherical corona model is that the radius of the inner accretion disk is variable , which leads naturally to a scenario in which the x - ray timing and spectral properties , and the strength of the radio emission , are set by the inner radius of the accretion disk .",
    "the x - ray timing property that is perhaps most relevant to discuss in the spherical corona model is the 0.510  hz qpo . the qpo may represent a characteristic time scale in the accretion flow such as an acoustic ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , keplerian @xcite , or free - fall ( molteni , sponholz , & chakrabarti 1996 ) time scale .",
    "since the qpo peak is narrow ( @xmath77 ) , it must originate in a localized region , as all of the time scales increase as the radius increases .",
    "among the possibilities for the origin of such a qpo are oscillations in a shock in the accretion flow @xcite or a spiral density wave in the inner disk @xcite . since the frequency of the qpo decreases during episodes in which the inner radius of the disk is thought to increase @xcite , it seems plausible that the frequency of the 0.510 hz qpo in grs  1915@xmath0105  tracks the inner radius of the accretion disk .",
    "figure  [ ratfl]a then implies that the radio emission is strongest when the inner disk is farthest from the source .",
    "nobili et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have developed a model for the phase lags in grs  1915@xmath0105  by assuming a spherical corona with two temperature regions : a warm ( @xmath78 kev ) outer corona and a hot ( @xmath79 kev ) inner corona .",
    "the corona is isotropically illuminated by soft seed photons .",
    "the sign and magnitude of the phase lags are correlated with the radius of the inner accretion disk , because as the disk moves inward it compresses the corona , increasing its optical depth .",
    "large , positive phase lags occur when the inner disk radius is large , because the hot corona has an optical depth @xmath80 , while the warm corona is optically thin .",
    "when the inner radius is a factor of @xmath81 smaller , the optical depth of the hot corona becomes extremely high ( @xmath82 ) , and the soft seed photons from the disk thermalize to the temperature of the optically thick hot corona .",
    "the thermalized photons are then compton down - scattered in the cool corona , which produces soft lags .",
    "this model does not attempt to explain the phase lags as a function of fourier frequency , but it does predict that if the qpo frequency tracks the radius of the inner disk , negative phase lags are expected when the qpo frequency is high exactly as reig et al ( 2000 ) observed in grs  1915@xmath0105 .",
    "however , a corona with an optical depth of @xmath83 would produce a thermal spectrum , while the energy spectrum of grs  1915@xmath0105  between 25200  kev can not be described by an extremely optically thick spectrum ( e.g. a spherical compton cloud with optical depth @xmath84 ; sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 ) when the phase lags are negative .",
    "further work needs to be done to reconcile the negative phase lags with the spectral shape under this type of model .",
    "the interpretation of the coherence function and the continuum power as a function of energy is less certain .",
    "when the qpo frequency is low , the coherence at low frequencies is nearest to 0 ( figure  [ ratfl]c ) and the ratio of the low frequency continuum power at high to low energies is near 1 ( figure  [ ratfl]d ) .",
    "a coherence less than 1 can occur if the variability is the superposition of separate linear signals with different properties @xcite .",
    "when the inner disk is farthest from the source ( low qpo frequency ) there may be more area available for multiple inputs to contribute to the variability .",
    "the radius of the inner disk should also determine the energy spectrum under a spherical corona model .",
    "we have already discussed the model of @xcite .",
    "a different set of assumptions are used by , for example @xcite and @xcite , who take into account the thermal balance between the soft photons and the comptonizing electrons .",
    "soft spectra are formed when the inner radius of the disk is close to the last stable orbit , so that the disk produces copious amounts of seed photons which cool the corona .",
    "hard states are formed when the inner radius of disk is far from the last stable orbit and most of the corona is photon - starved . however , if we consider the faint x - ray observations , the power law is steeper ( @xmath64 ) when the qpo frequency is lower and the disk is inferred to be farther from the black hole ( radio plateau observations ; figure  [ spec ] and [ pdsetc ] ) .",
    "this is opposite the sense expected , because the compton corona should be cooled less efficiently ( which implies a lower @xmath75 ) when the inner disk is large . if the qpo frequency tracks the transition radius between the disk and the corona , there must an additional factor beside the radius of the inner accretion disk which affects the observed x - ray properties of the corona in grs  1915@xmath0105  under this model .      in a planar corona model",
    ", one can assume that magnetic flares powered by the differential rotation of the accretion disk produce a population of relativistic electrons above the disk ( di matteo et al .",
    "2000 ; compare dove et al .",
    "1997 for difficulties with static models ) .",
    "the compact jet could represent a collimated wind which forms according to the magnetic - centrifugal mechanism of @xcite , and is strongest when the flares provide electrons enough energy to escape the potential of the black hole @xcite . in the magnetic flare model of @xcite , the inner radius of the accretion disk in general does not vary .    a natural starting point for discussing",
    "the planar corona models are the phase lags observed in grs  1915@xmath0105 .",
    "the time lags which would be implied by the scale height of the flares in the model of @xcite are too short ( @xmath85 cm @xmath86 s ) to explain the phase lags observed in black hole candidates .",
    "however , @xcite have developed a model for cyg  x@xmath21  in which the spectral evolution of the flares which accelerate comptonizing electrons produce the observed power density spectra and phase lags .",
    "their model produces only hard ( or zero ) lags , because the electrons are assumed to be in thermal equilibrium during the flare , so the spectrum of the flares is set by the ratio of the heating in the flares to the amount of soft seed flux impinging on the flares .",
    "the flares become harder because the majority of the soft flux is produced by feedback in response to the flare , and the feedback is taken to decrease as a function of time as the flares move away from the disk .",
    "however , if the electrons accelerated in the magnetic flare have a non - thermal energy distribution which evolves as a function of time , it is conceivable that either hard or soft phase lags could be produced .",
    "the hard phase lags may represent the most efficient acceleration of the electrons , which could in turn explain why the radio plateau emission is associated with the largest hard phase lags . on the other hand",
    ", the negative phase lags could represent spectral evolution in which the soft energy band peaks later , and relativistic electrons are accelerated less efficiently .    in the case of a magnetically sustained planar corona with a fixed inner disk radius ,",
    "there is some difficulty in explaining what sets the frequency of the qpo and why this frequency varies .",
    "since the power in the x - ray variability in grs  1915@xmath0105  drops sharply at frequencies higher than the 0.510  hz qpo ( figure  [ pdsetc ] ) , we can speculate this qpo represents a resonance at the minimum time scale at which magnetic flares can form .",
    "the radio emission , then , would occur most favorably when only relatively slow flares form ( low qpo frequency ) .",
    "the coherence function and the ratio of the high to low energy broad - band power would also be set by the evolution of the magnetic flares .",
    "since the coherence at low frequencies is lowest when the qpo frequency is low and the phase lags are positive , the long , hard flares may undergo significant non - linear spectral evolution .",
    "the ratio of broadband power in the high and low energy bands could be set by the shape of individual flares in the respective energy bands .",
    "mathematically , this could be described in a manner similar to the shot noise models of @xcite .",
    "the model of @xcite predicts the energy spectrum from magnetic flares , by assuming that a fixed fraction of the accretion power is released into the magnetic structures , and that the electrons which are accelerated by the flares are cooled inverse - compton scattering of both cyclo - synchrotron and thermal ( disk ) seed photons .",
    "soft spectral states are caused by flares which occur close to the disk and are flooded by seed photons , while hard states are caused by photon - starved flares which occur high above the disk . although @xcite do not attempt to explain the phase lags observed in black hole candidates , we might expect hard phase lags to correspond with flares that produce the hardest ( lowest @xmath75 ) power law , since the flares would be highest above the disk and cooled least efficiently . however , when the phase lags are positive in grs  1915@xmath0105  we find a steeper power law ( @xmath64 in the plateau state ) than when the phase lags are negative ( @xmath60 during radio faint , x - ray faint observations ) .",
    "clearly , simple assumptions about the evolution of magnetic flares would have to be relaxed in order to explain the x - ray timing and spectral properties of grs  1915@xmath0105 .",
    "we have found that although radio emission is always associated with the hard - steady state of grs  1915@xmath0105  ( between 1996 - 1999 ) , the 15.2 ghz radio flux density and the 2200  kev x - ray flux are not correlated .",
    "instead , we find that the hard states can be described using three basic regimes of radio emission : a ) radio plateau conditions in which bright , optically thick emission originates from a compact jet , b ) radio steep conditions in which bright , optically thin emission originates from material most likely decoupled from the x - ray emitting region , and c ) faint radio conditions for which our current study is unable to constrain the spectrum of the radio emission . as the radio flux increases ,",
    "1 ) the frequency of a ubiquitous 0.510 hz qpo decreases , 2 ) the fourier phase lags between hard ( 11.560 kev ) and soft ( 24.3 kev ) photons in the frequency range of 0.0110 hz change sign from negative to positive , 3 ) the coherence at low frequencies decreases , and 4 ) the relative amount of low frequency power in hard photons compared to soft photons decreases .",
    "we have attempted to understand these results qualitatively using simple models collected from the literature , but we find that our attempts to understand the x - ray timing properties of the hard state of grs  1915@xmath0105  inevitably lead to contradictions with the observed energy spectrum .",
    "these observational results therefore provide impetus for developing more sophisticated models of the accretion flow and the compact jet in grs  1915@xmath0105 .",

    "<S> we combine a complete sample of 113 pointed observations taken with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ between 19961999 , monitoring observations taken with the ryle telescope and the green bank interferometer , and selected observations with the very large array to study the radio and x - ray properties of grs  1915@xmath0105  when its x - ray emission is hard and steady . </S>",
    "<S> we establish that radio emission always accompanies the hard - steady state of grs  1915@xmath0105 , but that the radio flux density at 15.2 ghz and the x - ray flux between 2200 kev are not correlated . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we study the x - ray spectral and timing properties of grs  1915@xmath0105  using three approaches : first , by describing in detail the properties of three characteristic observations , then by displaying the time evolution of the timing properties during periods of both faint and bright radio emission , and lastly by plotting the timing properties as a function of the the radio flux density . </S>",
    "<S> we find that as the radio emission becomes brighter and more optically thick , 1 ) the frequency of a ubiquitous 0.510 hz qpo decreases , 2 ) the fourier phase lags between hard ( 11.560 kev ) and soft ( 24.3 kev ) in the frequency range of 0.0110 hz change sign from negative to positive , 3 ) the coherence between hard and soft photons at low frequencies decreases , and 4 ) the relative amount of low frequency power in hard photons compared to soft photons decreases . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss how these results reflect upon basic models from the literature describing the accretion flow around black holes and the possible connection between comptonizing electrons and compact radio jets . </S>"
