    "accretion of gas onto a super massive black hole ( smbh ) in the nucleus of galaxies is believed to be the source of activity in quasars and seyfert galaxies ( commonly known as active galactic nuclei ( agns ) ; cf .",
    "rees 1984 ) .",
    "several studies have suggested that the mass of the smbh in these objects is correlated with the luminosity , mass and velocity dispersion of the stellar spheroid of the galaxies ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ; magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al . 2000 ; marconi & hunt 2003 ; hring & rix 2004 ) . such correlations may imply an evolutionary relation between the growth of the smbh and the host galaxy itself ( e.g. somerville et al .",
    "2008 ; shankar et al . 2009",
    "; hopkins & hernquist 2009 ) . in order to study the dependence of the various observed phenomena of agns on the black hole mass and the cosmic evolution of the black holes , independent and reliable estimates of the mass of the black holes are required ( e.g. , goulding et al .",
    "2010 ; rafter , crenshaw & wiita 2009 ) .    one independent method to estimate the mass of the black hole is using the reverberation mapping technique ( blandford & mckee 1982 ; peterson 1993 ) . in the optical bands , the continuum flux of some agns ,",
    "is known to vary on timescales as short as hours ( e.g. , miller , carini & goodrich 1989 ; stalin et al . 2004 ) .",
    "if the main source of ionization of the broad line region ( blr ) is the continuum itself , any variation of the continuum emission can also be seen in the broad emission lines . however , the variations in the broad line flux will have a time lag ( @xmath6 ) relative to the continuum variations , which can be interpreted as the light travel time across the blr . as a first approximation , therefore , the size of the blr is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the velocity of light .",
    "once the @xmath9 is obtained , the mass of the black hole can also be estimated , using the velocity dispersion of the broad component of the emission lines , @xmath10 , and assuming virial equilibrium ( peterson et al . 2004 ; p04 ) ; see peterson  2010 , for a recent review ) .",
    "the reverberation mapping technique has been used to make estimates of smbh masses over a large range of redshift . however , because the technique is observationally taxing , as it demands an enormous amount of telescope time , to date the blr radius of only about three dozen agns ( seyfert 1 galaxies and quasars ) have been determined ( p04 ; kaspi et al . 2007 ; bentz et al . 2009a ; denney et al .",
    "2009 , 2010 ) .",
    "nevertheless , using these estimates a correlation was found between @xmath9 and the optical continuum luminosity at 5100   ( kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ; kaspi et al .",
    "2007 ; p04 ; denney et al . 2009 ; bentz et al .",
    "the r@xmath11@xmath12@xmath13l@xmath14  relation can be considered well constrained between the luminosities 10@xmath15  erg sec@xmath16l@xmath17  erg sec@xmath18 . on the other hand , for luminosities below 10@xmath15  erg sec@xmath18 ,",
    "only a handful of sources are observed , and the estimated values of @xmath9 could also indicate a flattening of the relation ( see fig . 2 of kaspi et al .",
    "this flattening would suggest a lower limit in the possible masses of smbhs in galaxies .",
    "although recent revisions of a few sources made by bentz et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and denney et al .",
    "( 2009;2010 ) are consistent with a continuation of the @xmath19l@xmath14 relation to lower luminosities , and consequently with no lower limit in the mass for the smbh , the correlation is still sparsely sampled . moreover",
    ", the @xmath19l@xmath14 relation is very useful for estimating the smbh masses from single - epoch spectra and calibrating other surrogate relations used for black hole mass estimates ( vestergaard 2004 ; shen et al .",
    "therefore , estimates of @xmath9 for a larger number of sources are required .",
    "the extrapolation of the known @xmath19l@xmath14 relation to low luminosities suggests that the time lag between the variations of the broad line and that of the continuum will be of the order of hours to days , as compared to several months for high luminosity sources .",
    "thus , monitoring programs of short durations , but fast sampling , are required to estimate the reverberation time lags for low luminosity sources .",
    "in this paper , we present the optical spectroscopic and photometric observations of a new low luminosity agn , the x - ray source and seyfert  1.5 galaxy h  0507 + 164 . based on a reverberation mapping campaign that lasted for about a month , during november - december 2007 ,",
    "we have obtained @xmath9 and estimated the mass of the smbh . in section  2 ,",
    "the observations and data reductions are described .",
    "the results of the analysis are given in section  3 , and the conclusions are presented in section  4 .",
    "using the vron - cetty & vron catalogue of quasars and active galactic nuclei ( 12th ed . ;",
    "vron - cetty & vron 2006 ) , we have compiled a list of nearby seyfert  1 galaxies , which , based on the available spectra , have a luminosity at @xmath20  of the order of 10@xmath21  erg sec@xmath18 or lower .",
    "very few candidates were found ( mostly because of the absence of available spectra ) .",
    "the source , h 0507 + 164 , that we selected for our campaign is identified in the catalogue of vron - cetty & vron as an x - ray source , with coordinates @xmath22 , and is classified as a seyfert  1.5 galaxy at a redshift of  @xmath0 .",
    "optical spectroscopic and photometric observations of h  0507 + 164 were carried out in 2007 between 21 of november and 26 of december at the 2 m himalayan chandra telescope ( hct ) , operated by the indian institute of astrophysics , bangalore .",
    "the telescope is equipped with a @xmath23 ccd , coupled to the himalayan faint object spectrograph and camera ( hfosc ) . in imaging mode , only the central @xmath24 pixels region of the ccd is used .",
    "the camera has a plate scale of @xmath25 arcsecond / pixel , which yields a field of view of @xmath26  square arcmin .",
    "medium resolution spectra of the nucleus were obtained using a 11 arcmin @xmath27 1.92 arcsec wide slit and a grism .",
    "the spectra have a spectral range of 3800@xmath126700   with a resolution of @xmath288  .",
    "the exposure time varied between 900 and 1000 seconds .",
    "the spectra were reduced using standard procedures in iraf .",
    "after bias subtraction and flat fielding , one dimensional spectra were extracted and calibrated , in wavelength using an fear lamp , and in flux using various observations of the spectrophotometric standard star feige  34 .",
    "since the observed spectra were of low s / n , for further analysis all the spectra were smoothed to a resolution of @xmath2815  .",
    "the standard technique of spectral flux calibration is not sufficiently precise to study the variability of agns .",
    "since even under good photometric conditions the accuracy of spectrophotometry is not better than 10% ( shapovalova et al .",
    "2008 ) , we used a relative calibration procedure .",
    "a first order flux calibration was first obtained in the normal way using the standard star .",
    "then all the spectra were inter - calibrated relative to the spectra of one night ( we choose the 21 of november ) , assuming the flux of the narrow line [ o  iii]@xmath29    is constant .",
    "this is justified , because the narrow line region ( nlr ) is much more extended ( of the order of a few hundred parsecs ) than the blr ( much less than a parsec ) and flux variation can not be observed in this region over short time scales ( cf .",
    "osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "each spectra were scaled relative to the reference spectra using the scaling algorithm devised by van groningen & wanders ( 1992 ) .",
    "this algorithm uses a chi - square , to minimize the residuals of the [ o  iii]@xmath135007   line after subtraction from the reference spectrum . the mean spectrum , averaging the 22 nights of observations , is shown in fig .  [ fig : meanspec ] .      in parallel to the spectroscopic observations ,",
