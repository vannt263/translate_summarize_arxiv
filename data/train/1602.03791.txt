    "the idea that thermal fluctuations of a medium can lead to effective interactions between immersed objects was first pointed out by fisher and de gennes  @xcite .",
    "since the origin of these forces is very similar to the casimir force induced by the quantum fluctuations of electromagnetic fields  @xcite , they are called critical casimir forces ( ccf ) .    when the system is close to its critical point , the thermal fluctuations of the corresponding order parameter are strong and long  ranged so that ccf can compete with and even dominate non  critical background forces . due to universality of critical phenomena in confinement",
    ", these forces do not depend on microscopic details of the system and can be described in terms of universal scaling functions  @xcite .",
    "they depend only on dimensionless scaling variables , which are typically ratios involving the geometric parameters characterizing the objects immersed in the fluctuating medium , the separation between them , and the bulk correlation length , which diverges upon approaching the critical point .",
    "these scaling functions describe all systems which belong to the same bulk and surface universality class . for over three decades ccf and their scaling functions",
    "have been studied experimentally , theoretically , and numerically for various bulk and surface universality classes  .",
    "the ccf have been measured for wetting films of @xmath0 and @xmath1@xmath0 mixtures near their @xmath2transition and their tricritical point of the bulk system , respectively  @xcite .",

    "recently , a phenomenon , which has been interpreted as the occurrence of a critical point , was observed in giant plasma membrane vesicles isolated from living cells  @xcite .",
    "this phase transition is similar to a critical demixing of a two  dimensional ( 2d ) binary liquid mixture and belongs to the 2d ising universality class .",
    "the same phenomenon occurs in certain lipid membranes  @xcite .",
    "these are 2d liquids consisting of two ( or more ) components such as cholesterol , saturated , and unsaturated lipids , which undergo separation into two liquid phases , one rich in the first two components and the other rich in the third  @xcite .",
    "lipid membranes serve as model systems for cell plasma membranes  @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of a continuous demixing transition in membranes would definitely give rise to fluctuation ",
    "induced , effective forces acting between proteins embedded in membranes as inclusions .",
    "thus , studying these forces contributes to the understanding of how these biological cells work .",
    "another type of casimir  like interactions between membrane inclusions appears due to the restriction of the thermal fluctuations of the local shape of a membrane caused by the presence of these inclusions  @xcite .",
    "( this resembles capillary  wave  induced effective interactions among colloids floating at fluid interfaces  @xcite . ) such membrane  fluctuation  induced interactions are attractive and their form depends sensitively on the shapes of the inclusions and the membrane rigidity .    in the present study we model the inclusions as defects of a finite size on the infinite square lattice and calculate ccf analytically by using exact diagonalization of the transfer matrix for the 2d ising model  @xcite .",

    "in fact , in the scaling limit the functional form of the ccf can be determined for defects of arbitrary shape .",
    "it turns out that it has a very simple product structure , in which the terms depending only on the properties of defects factor out from the universal scaling part .",

    "contrary to the present approach , cft is limited to the bulk critical point . in principle , in the limit @xmath5 ,",
    "i.e. , in which the details of the inclusions do not matter , the results of the present microscopic model at the critical point @xmath6 should coincide with those from the coarse  grained cft approach .",
    "in the limit of large @xmath3 , the cft expression for the interaction free energy between two discs has a similar product form as the one we obtain here .",
    "our calculations show that the same structure persists off critical point .",

    "@xcite are also very limited . apart from the results at the bulk critical point , the interaction free energy between two inclusions as a function of their separation was determined for only three other temperatures , all above @xmath7 .",

    "matrix renormalization  group techniques .",
    "however , the scaling functions of ccf between two discs have been determined within the derjaguin approximation  @xcite , which is valid only if the distance between the disclike objects is much smaller than their radius .",
    "this is the limit opposite to the one considered here .    generally , if two parallel @xmath8dimensional plates are immersed in a @xmath9dimensional fluid at a distance @xmath3 , at the bulk critical point @xmath7 the interaction free energy decays as @xmath10 , which follows from finite ",

    "the coefficient of this expansion is related to the amplitudes of the leading decay of the bulk two  point correlation function and of the profile in a half  space of the corresponding local operator . for symmetry  breaking boundary conditions on both spheres the interaction free energy decays as @xmath19 , like the bulk spin  spin correlation function of the ising model , whereas for symmetry  preserving boundary conditions on both spheres the interaction free energy decays as @xmath20 , like the bulk energy  density  energy ",
