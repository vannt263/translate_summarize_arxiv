    "a rigorous phenomenological analysis of the precision data from relativistic heavy - ion collisions and theoretical advances over 14 years has led to quantitative estimates for some of the transport properties of a strongly interacting de - confined state of quarks and gluons .",
    "the estimated shear viscosity to entropy density ratio ( @xmath7 ) is found to reflect the inviscid liquid property of the qgp and has a value between ( 1 - 2)/4@xmath8  @xcite . that reflecting the stopping power or the opacity of qgp has been estimated by obtaining the square of the momentum transferred by the parton to the qgp per unity length ( @xmath9 ) and",

    "a dedicated program called the beam energy scan ( bes ) to establish the phase diagram of qcd was launched at rhic in the year 2010 to unravel the qcd phase structure at large @xmath6 .",
    "a range of @xmath6 from 20 mev to 400 mev of the phase diagram was covered by varying the @xmath11 from 200 to 7.7 gev .",

    "[ phasediagram ]  @xcite .",
    "the two distinct features of the phase diagram at large @xmath6 are the first order phase boundary and the critical point ( cp ) . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the status of the experimental search for these two phase structures through the measurement of proton and antiproton production in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "specifically we discuss the observable related to the azimuthal and multiplicity distributions for net - proton ( the difference in number of protons and anti - protons ) in au+au collisions at midrapidity for @xmath0 = 7.7 , 11.5 , 19.6 , 27 , 39 , 62.4 and 200 gev .",

    "the patterns of azimuthal anisotropy in particle production , often termed as flow , in heavy - ion collisions can be obtained by studying the fourier expansion of the azimuthal angle ( @xmath12 ) distribution of produced particles with respect to the reaction plane angle ( @xmath13 )  @xcite . where the reaction plane is defined as the plane subtended by the impact parameter direction and the beam direction .",

    "these calculations whose equation of state incorporates a first - order phase transition from hadronic matter to qgp predict a non - monotonic variation of the slope of directed flow of baryons ( and net - baryons ) around midrapidity as a function of beam energy , also has a prominent minimum , and a double sign change in the @xmath18 slope , which is not seen in the same hydrodynamic model without a first - order phase transition .",

    "a possible interpretation of the changing sign of the @xmath18 slope is that it reflects a change in equation - of - state . at a given energy where the system undertakes a first order quark ",

    ". the softest pressure will naturally produces the observed minimum in @xmath18 slope parameter  @xcite .",
    "the alternate proposal is that at higher energies pair production is dominant at mid - rapidity and transported baryons have relatively small influence . as there is no preferred direction for pair produced hadrons ,",
    "so the slope parameter becomes close to zero .",
    "while at lower beam energies the observed baryons are strongly influenced by the transported baryons so they are aligned with them hence the slope parameter is positive .",
    "the most intriguing is the dependence in the intermediate energies , a mean field model study shows that the energy dependent baryon potential plays an important role in this region  @xcite .    in the search for the signature of a first - order phase transition in the high @xmath6 region of the qcd phase diagram ,",
