    "in the standard model ( sm ) @xcite extended to contain right - handed neutrinos , the neutrino magnetic moment induced by radiative corrections is unobservably small , @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "current limits on these magnetic moments are several orders of magnitude larger , so that a magnetic moment close to these limits would indicate a window for probing effects induced by new physics beyond the sm @xcite .",
    "similarly , a neutrino electric dipole moment will point also to new physics and they will be of relevance in astrophysics and cosmology , as well as terrestrial neutrino experiments @xcite .",
    "the existence of a heavy neutral ( @xmath4 ) vector boson is a feature of many extensions of the standard model . in particular",
    ", one ( or more ) additional @xmath5 gauge factor provides one of the simplest extensions of the sm .",
    "additional @xmath4 gauge bosons appear in grand unified theories ( guts ) @xcite , superstring theories @xcite , left - right symmetric models ( lrsm ) @xcite and in other models such as models of composite gauge bosons @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is possible to study some phenomenological features associates with this extra neutral gauge boson through models with gauge symmetry @xmath6 , also called 331 models .",
    "these models arise as an interesting alternative to explain the origin of generations .",
    "pisano and pleitez @xcite have proposed an model based on the gauge group @xmath6 .",
    "this model has the interesting feature that each generation of fermions is anomalous , but that with three generations the anomalous canceled .",
    "detailed discussions on 331 models can be found in the literature @xcite .",
    "t. m. gould and i. z. rothstein @xcite reported in 1994 a bound on @xmath7 obtained through the analysis of the process @xmath8 , near the @xmath9-resonance , with a massive neutrino and the sm @xmath10 and @xmath11 couplings .    at low center of mass",
    "energy @xmath12 , the dominant contribution to the process @xmath13 involves the exchange of a virtual photon @xcite .",
    "the dependence on the magnetic moment comes from a direct coupling to the virtual photon , and the observed photon is a result of initial - state bremsstrahlung .    at higher s , near the @xmath9 pole @xmath14 , the dominant contribution involves the exchange of a @xmath9 boson .",
    "the dependence on the magnetic moment @xmath15 and the electric dipole moment @xmath16 now comes from the radiation of the photon observed by the neutrino or antineutrino in the final state .",
    "we emphasize here the importance of the final state radiation near the @xmath9 pole of a very energetic photon as compared to conventional bremsstrahlung .",
    "however , in order to improve the limits on the magnetic moment and the electric dipole moment of the tau - neutrino , in our calculation to the process @xmath13 we consider initial - state radiation , in this way the bounds on the dipole moments are stronger than those evaluated in previous studies by other authors .",
    "we neglect @xmath2 and photon exchange diagrams , which amount to @xmath17 corrections in the relevant kinematic regime .",
    "the feynman diagrams which give the most important contribution to the cross section are shown in fig . 1 .",
    "our aim in the present paper is to analyze the reaction @xmath18 in the framework of a 331 model and we attribute an anomalous magnetic moment ( mm ) and an electric dipole moment ( edm ) to a massive tau - neutrino .",
    "this process serve to set limits on the tau - neutrino mm and edm . in this paper , we take advantage of this fact to set limits on @xmath19 and @xmath20 for various values of the mixing angle @xmath21 of the 331 model , according to refs .",

    "we see that only 6 events were found , this is the real background , not 14 events . in this case",
    "a simple method @xcite is that at 1@xmath27 level ( @xmath28 ) for a null signal the number of observed events should not exceed the fluctuation of the estimated background events : @xmath29 .",
    "of course , this method is good only when @xmath30 is sufficiently large ( i.e. when the poisson distribution can be approximated with a gaussian @xcite ) but for @xmath31 it is a good approximation .",
    "this means that at @xmath32 level ( @xmath33 ) the limits on the non - standard parameters are found replacing the equation for the total number of events expected @xmath34 in the expression @xmath35 .",
