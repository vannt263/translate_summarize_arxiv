    "therefore , the optimisation steps _ ( 1 ) _ and _ ( 2 ) _ are necessary to avoid unwanted entanglement loss in the symmetrization _",
    "( 3)_. the goal is to augment the right - hand side of inequality   up to the point that equality is reached .",
    "we will show now that for two qubits this can indeed be achieved .",
    "it is fundamental that the maximum of an sl@xmath32-invariant function @xmath17 under general local operations can be reached by applying the optimal transformation @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 is an invertible local operation  @xcite .",
    "consider first the normal form @xmath18 which is obtained from @xmath1 by iterating determinant - one local operations  @xcite ( see also methods ) .",
    "such operations ( represented by sl@xmath36 matrices ) describe stochastic local operations and classical communication ( slocc ) .",
    "consequently , the normal form is locally equivalent to the original state @xmath1 , that is , it lies in the entanglement class of @xmath1 .",
    "note that the iteration leading to the normal form _ minimises _ the trace of the state .",
    "subsequent renormalisation _ increases _ the absolute values of all matrix elements in equation  . here",
    ", the correct rescaling of the mixed - state entanglement measure is crucial .",
    "this is why homogeneity degree 2 of @xmath14 is required  @xcite .",
    "hence , transforming @xmath1 to its normal form increases the moduli of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 ( and also the concurrence ) as much as possible for a state that is slocc equivalent with @xmath1 .",
    "the sum of the off - diagonal matrix elements in equation   reaches its maximum if @xmath38 is real and positive .",
    "as this can be achieved by a @xmath6 rotation on one qubit we may consider it part of finding the normal form and drop the absolute value bars in equation  .",
    "then , the sum of matrix elements equals , up to a factor 1/2 , the fidelity of @xmath21 with the bell state @xmath41 .",

    "the result is a bell - diagonal @xmath46 with maximum real off - diagonal element @xmath47 .",
    "however , bell - diagonal two - qubit density matrices with this property can be made ghz symmetric _ without _ losing entanglement  @xcite ( see also supplementary information ) .",
    "hence , our optimised symmetrization procedure _ ( 1)-(3 ) _ leads to the exact concurrence for arbitrary two - qubit states @xmath1 .",

    "now we turn to constructing a quantitative witness for the three - tangle of arbitrary three - qubit states by using the solution in equation  . as before",
    ", the main idea is that an arbitrary state can be symmetrized according to equation   and thus is projected into the ghz - symmetric states .",

    "more precisely , the entanglement measure is enhanced upon increasing one of the coordinates without decreasing the other ( cf .  equations   and ) . in this spirit , finding the normal form in step _ ( 1 ) _ is appropriate as it yields the largest possible three - tangle for a state @xmath42 locally equivalent to the original @xmath1 ( cf .  ref .",
    "as the normal form is unique only up to local unitaries it does not automatically give the state with minimum entanglement loss in the symmetrization .",
    "therefore , the unitary optimisation step _ ( 2 ) _ is required to generate the best coordinates .    in the symmetrization",
    "the information contained in various matrix elements is lost . for two qubits , however , the concurrence of the optimised bell - diagonal states depends only on @xmath65 and the loss of @xmath66 in the symmetrization does not harm .",
    "in contrast , the three - qubit normal form depends on about 45 parameters .",
    "we may not expect that @xmath67 depends only on two of them and , hence , entanglement loss in the symmetrization _ ( 3 ) _ is inevitable  ( cf .",
    "supplementary information ) .",
    "consequently , steps _ ( 1)-(3 ) _ lead to a lower bound for the three - tangle that coincides with the exact @xmath67 at least for those states which are locally equivalent to a ghz - symmetric state .",
    "the most straightforward optimisation criterion in step _",
    "( 2 ) _ is to maximise @xmath68 .",
    "alternative criteria which generally do not give the best @xmath67 but can be handled more easily ( possibly analytically ) are maximum fidelity @xmath69 , minimum hilbert - schmidt distance of @xmath70 from ghz@xmath61 , or maximum @xmath71 .    .",

    "the optimisation steps _ ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) _ move the symmetrization image to @xmath74 with enhanced three - tangle . ]",
    "evidently this approach can be generalised .",
    "therefore we conclude with a discussion of some of its universal features .",
    "the essential ingredients are an exact solution of the entanglement measure for a sufficiently general family of states with suitable symmetry , and the entanglement optimisation for a given arbitrary state @xmath1 via general local operations .",
    "the former determines the border where the entanglement vanishes .",
    "the latter ensures an appropriate fidelity of the image @xmath28 with the maximally entangled state . this reveals a remarkable relation between entanglement quantification through sl@xmath36 invariants and the standard entanglement witnesses which we briefly explain in the following .",

    "@xmath81 yields one of the many possible lower bounds to the exact result .",

    "the latter represents a linear lower bound to the three - tangle obtained via the optimisation steps _",
    "( 1)(3 ) _  ( see supplementary information ) .",
    "finally we mention that our approach can be used without optimisation , _",
    "i.e. _ , either without step _ ( 1 ) _ , or _ ( 2 ) _ , or both .",
    "this renders the witness less reliable but more efficient .",
    "at best it requires only four matrix elements ( for _ any _ @xmath0 ) .",
    "we note that , if we apply the witness to a tomography outcome the measurement effort can be reduced by using the prior knowledge of the state and choosing the local measurement directions such that the fidelity with the expected ghz state is measured directly .",
    "this implements optimisation step _ ( 2 ) _ right in the measurement .",
    "the normal form of a multipartite quantum state is a fundamental concept that was introduced by verstraete _",

    "@xcite it applies to arbitrary ( finite - dimensional ) multi - qudit states .",
    "here we focus on @xmath0-qubit states only .    in the normal form of an @xmath0-qubit state @xmath1 , all local density matrices are proportional to the identity .",

    "the normal form @xmath86 is peculiar since it has the _ minimal _ norm of all states in the orbit of @xmath1 generated by local filtering operations .",
    "practically , the normal form can be found by a simple iteration procedure described in ref .",
    "@xcite it is worth noticing that ghz - symmetric states  which play a central role in our discussion  are naturally given in their normal form .",
    "the pure - state entanglement monotone that needs to be considered for three - qubit states is the three - tangle @xmath87 , _ i.e. _ , the square root of the residual tangle introduced by coffman _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite : @xmath88 here @xmath89 with @xmath90 are the components of a pure three - qubit state in the computational basis .",
    "the three - tangle becomes an entanglement measure also for mixed states @xmath91 via the convex - roof extension  @xcite @xmath92 _ i.e. _ , the minimum average three - tangle taken over all possible pure - state decompositions @xmath93 . in general",
    "it is difficult to carry out the minimisation procedure in equation  . for ghz - symmetric three - qubit states",
    ", however , the convex roof of the three - tangle can be calculated exactly ( see equation  ) .",
    "this solution is shown in fig .",
    "2 and can be understood as follows .",
    "the border between the @xmath55 and the ghz states is the ghz/@xmath55 line which has the parametrised form  @xcite @xmath94 with @xmath95 .",
    "the solution for the convex roof is obtained by connecting each point of the ghz/@xmath55 line @xmath96 with the closest of the points @xmath97 .",

    "<S> it is a fundamental strength of physics as a science that most of its basic concepts have quantifiability built into their definition . </S>",

    "<S> their quantifiability allows to measure and compare them in different contexts , and to build mathematical theories with them  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there is no doubt that entanglement is a key concept in quantum theory , but it seems to resist in a wondrous way that universal principle of quantification . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this is , in the first place , that entanglement comes in many different disguises related to its resource character , _ </S>",

    "<S> , there are numerous task - specific entanglement measures  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , most of them can not be calculated easily ( nor measured or estimated ) for generic mixed quantum states , and therefore it is difficult to use them .    </S>",
    "<S> there are notable exceptions , the concurrence  @xcite and the negativity for bipartite systems  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these measures have already provided deep insight into the nature of entanglement , but they also have their shortcomings . the concurrence is strictly applicable only to two - qubit systems while for the negativities it is not known how to distinguish entanglement classes . </S>",
    "<S> the generalisations of the concurrence ( such as the residual tangle  @xcite ) do quantify task - specific entanglement even for multipartite systems but again it is not known how to estimate them for general mixed quantum states .    </S>",
    "<S> there is another difficulty . </S>",
    "<S> an @xmath0-qubit density matrix @xmath1 is characterised mathematically by @xmath2 real parameters . reducing it to its so - called normal form  @xcite  which contains the essential entanglement information  removes about @xmath3 parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the entanglement measure is determined by the remaining exponentially many parameters which need to be processed to calculate the precise value . </S>",
    "<S> even an operational method similar to that of wootters - uhlmann  @xcite would quickly reach its limits with increasing @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore it is desirable to develop methods which provide useful approximate answers even for larger systems . </S>",
    "<S> if one asks for mere entanglement detection , witnesses  @xcite are such a tool because here the number of required parameters ( both for measurement and processing ) can be reduced substantially . </S>",
    "<S> there are also estimates of entanglement measures using witness operators  @xcite which , however , have not yet produced practical methods for entanglement quantification . </S>",
    "<S> here we develop an easy - to - handle quantitative witness for greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) entanglement  @xcite in arbitrary three - qubit states . </S>",
    "<S> it yields the exact three - tangle for the family of ghz - symmetric states  @xcite , and those states which are locally equivalent to them . for all other states </S>",

    "<S> we call the approach a _ </S>",
    "<S> witness_.    we start by defining the ghz symmetry  @xcite and stating our central result . </S>",
