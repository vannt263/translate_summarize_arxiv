    "we have previously established @xcite that any stationary axisymmetric magnetized wind will collimate at large distances from the source , under perfect mhd conditions and polytropic thermodynamics , to paraboloids or cylinders along the symmetry axis according to whether the electric current ( or poynting flux ) brought by the wind to infinity asymptotically vanishes or is finite .",
    "our result however did not discriminate between these two possibilities , nor described any global asymptotic solution .",
    "the aim of this paper is to partially fill this gap .",
    "we consider here non - relativistic winds and concentrate on describing analytically their structure in the aymptotic region , for a supposedly given set of first integrals and for different , _ a priori _ possible , values of the circumpolar current at large distances .",
    "we show here that the asymptotic structure of rotating mhd winds consists of vast regions where the poloidal current density is negligibly small , bounded by thin regions where residual asymptotic poloidal current flows .",
    "these regions have at large distances the character of boundary layers .",
    "they are located in the vicinity of the polar axis and of the null magnetic surfaces .",
    "we obtain solutions valid in all these regions separately and produce a global solution by asymptotic matching .    the specific topic which we are pursuing here",
    "is the construction of a general , non - self - similar , asymptotic solution globally valid from the polar axis to the equator , for a given set of supposedly known first integrals .",
    "there has been in the past few years considerable progress in this field , both in the derivation of special exact solutions to the wind equation and in numerical solutions to them , both time dependent and stationary .",
    "focusing of magnetized winds appears to be a robust property of rotating mhd winds @xcite .",
    "most analytical solutions involve some sort of self - similarity @xcite .",
    "@xcite has constructed quasi - static , force - free collimated structures that arise naturally from a wound up magnetic field pushing out from a disk .",
    "the dynamics of such structures has been studied by @xcite .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite have analytically considered particular models of non - polytropic winds and found that non - cylindrical asymptotics can be achieved only when magnetic pinching is negligible and there is over - pressure in the vicinity of the axis .",
    "shu and collaborators have extensively developed a x - wind model for outflows and in @xcite ( plus references therein ) they actually solved a grad - shafranov equation for the shape of the magnetic surfaces @xcite .",
    "they have an inner boundary condition of finite pressure .",
    "the launching region for t - tauri winds has been examined recently by @xcite .",
    "interesting disk instability can be initiated by wind driven angular momentum loss @xcite .",
    "@xcite has found that the collapse of rotating magnetized molecular clouds and the resulting bipolar outflows are inextricably related .",
    "transfield force balance has also been studied by numerical simulations .",
    "these simulations studied hoop stresses collimation in different parameter regimes . @xcite and",
    "@xcite obtained two - dimensional solutions for jets emitted by a source with keplerian rotation and confirmed the focusing effect of the hoop stress , as did @xcite who also found time - dependent behaviour .",
    "@xcite found by two - dimensional simulation that winds orginating from a disk with a keplerian rotation profile have a dense , current - carrying , central core surrounded by an almost current - free region .",
    "@xcite numerically calculated this same problem using a model with a hot wind source region in the vicinity of the polar axis and found very little collimation within the simulation region .",
    "@xcite studied formation of collimated poynting jets associated with an uncollimated hydromagnetic outflow . @xcite",
    "numerically found collimation to be most effective for a particular class of objects which they describe as `` efficient rotators '' . in a subsequent paper @xcite",
    "discussed the efficiency of collimation in the case of the solar wind .",
    "boundary conditions at the base of the flow were found to be important .",
    "@xcite studied cold non - stationary flow from a monopole and found significant poynting flux conversion to kinetic energy .    since @xcite",
    ", papers similar in spirit to our own research have appeared . @xcite and",
    "@xcite studied kinetic energy dominated winds and obtained asymptotic solutions that agreed with the paraboloidal solutions we had previously obtained .",
    "@xcite constructed solutions in different regions including the pole and the equatorial null surface quite similar in spirit to the analysis presented here .",
    "okamoto and collaborators @xcite emphasized the issue of current closure and its effect on the geometry of the solution .",
    "these issues which are , in fact , important only in boundary layers such as the equatorial current sheet , are now fully treated in this paper .",

    "we obtain the solution for the polar boundary layer ( eqs.([parabpsiblofx])([parabablofx ] ) ) .",

    "the case of the force - free polar boundary layer is also discussed , giving a relation similar to the standard bennet pinch ( eq.([bennetffapp ] ) ) .",
    "the matching procedure specifies the density along the polar axis ( eqs.([nzeroofrlog])-([bennetparab ] ) ) , the asymptotic circumpolar current and the radius of the current - carrying region ( eq.([radiusofpolarbl ] ) ) .",
    "a slow logarithmic decline of the axial density and current is found in case of kinetic - energy - dominated winds , justifying the wkbj approach . in section ( [ nullsurfacebl ] )",
    "we similarly obtain a solution valid in the vicinity of a null magnetic surface ( eqs.([alphanullparam])([psinullblofx ] ) ) and match to the field - region solution . the gas pressure at the null surface balances the toroidal magnetic pressure outside the sheet ( eq.([behaverhoequat ] ) ) . in section ( [ sectionshape ] )",

    "the poloidal magnetic field can be expressed in terms of a magnetic flux function @xmath8 , such that @xmath9 the magnetic flux @xmath10 through a circle of radius @xmath0 centered on the axis at altitude @xmath2 is @xmath11 .",
    "the magnetic surfaces , generated by the rotation of field lines about the axis , are surfaces of constant value of @xmath8 . the value of @xmath12 labels magnetic surfaces or field lines .",
    "mass conservation implies @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a first integral .",
    "flux freezing implies that @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a second first integral .",
    "conservation of specific angular momentum implies , @xmath17 conservation of the specific energy @xmath18 implies : @xmath19 @xmath18 is the total specific energy carried by the wind on magnetic surface @xmath12 , in kinetic and poynting flux form .",

    "we define terms that will be used in this paper .",
    "the _ asymptotic domain _ consist of all points which are located on their own magnetic surface far away from the alfvn point .",
    "a magnetic surface is said to be _ asymptotically parabolic _ if @xmath0 and @xmath23 both become infinite .",

    "a magnetic surface is said to be _ asymptotically conical _ if @xmath0 becomes infinite at large distances while @xmath23 approaches a finite limit @xmath24 .",

    "conical wind_. the _ jet edge _ is defined as being the magnetic surface which separates asymptotically cylindrical from asymptotically conical surfaces .",
    "this terminology does not imply that only cylindrical asymptotics should give rise to structures that would appear to the observer as an astrophysical jet .",
    "a _ neutral or null magnetic surface _",
    "is one along which the poloidal field vanishes .",
    "the toroidal field then also vanishes on it .",
    "the immediate vicinity of neutral magnetic surfaces is of special interest , being regions where electric currents flow in the asymptotic domain .",
    "we refer to these regions as _ neutral surface boundary layers_. similarly , the vicinity of the polar axis is a region of electric current flow .",

    "the toroidal components of the velocity and of the magnetic field can be obtained from the angular momentum conservation and isorotation law in terms of @xmath34 and @xmath0 as @xmath35 @xmath36 for well - behaved solutions the numerators must vanish when the denominators vanish . the cylindrical radius @xmath0 equals the alfvn radius , @xmath37 , defined by @xmath38 , when the density @xmath34 equals the alfvn density , @xmath39 .",
    "the alfvn radius defines the position of the alfvn point on field line @xmath12 .",
    "asymptotically , for @xmath40 , the azimuthal velocity vanishes while the variable @xmath41 approaches the value @xmath42      the projection of the equation of motion on the normal to the magnetic surfaces gives the transfield equation , or generalized grad - shafranov equation ( eq .",
    "( [ transfield ] ) of appendix [ appreductfcurvature ] ) .",
    "it determines the shape of magnetic surfaces in terms of the first integrals and of the density .",
    "the set of coupled bernoulli and transfield equations is to be solved .",
    "as shown in appendix [ appreductfcurvature ] , the transfield equation can be reexpressed such as to give the curvature ( @xmath43 ) of poloidal field lines in terms of various surface functions and of the current variable @xmath44 .",
    "the resulting form of the transfield equation is : @xmath45 the terms on the right are the components of the poloidal magnetic pressure gradient , gas pressure gradient , gravity , centrifugal force and hoop stress respectively perpendicular to magnetic surfaces .",
    "the hoop stress is proportional to @xmath46 and therefore vanishes with @xmath44 .",
    "in the large-@xmath2 limit , eq.([tfcurvform ] ) simplifies .",
    "the poloidal velocity @xmath47 reaches a terminal value and the curvature term on the left of equation ( [ tfcurvform ] ) approaches zero .",
    "a definite ordering between the terms on the right of equation ( [ tfcurvform ] ) occurs on magnetic surfaces on which both @xmath2 and @xmath0 tend to infinity . on",
    "asymptotically cylindrical magnetic surfaces , @xmath0 approaches a finite limit @xmath26 .",
    "however , when @xmath48 it still remains possible to use the large-@xmath0 approximation . in the large @xmath0 , large @xmath2 and small @xmath49 limit , noting that @xmath50 is bounded from above @xcite and that the gravity term declines as @xmath51 while the centrifugal force term declines as @xmath52 , eq.([tfcurvform ] ) reduces to : @xmath53    when @xmath44 approaches a finite value , the hoop stress term , proportional to @xmath54 decreases on conical magnetic surfaces as @xmath55 since @xmath56 .",
    "the hoop stress force then dominates all the other terms on the right of ( [ tfcurvass ] ) .",
    "the poloidal field @xmath57 decreases in this case as @xmath58 .",
    "the gradient of the poloidal magnetic pressure then drops with axial distance as @xmath59 , so that the corresponding term in eq.([tfcurvass ] ) declines as @xmath60 .",
    "according to eq.([defalpha ] ) , the density decreases as @xmath57 when the velocity has reached its terminal value so that the gas pressure gradient scales as @xmath61 and the pressure term in eq.([tfcurvass ] ) declines as @xmath62 .",
    "this decline is slower than that of the poloidal magnetic pressure if the polytropic exponent @xmath63 is less than 2 , which we assume .",
    "the poloidal magnetic pressure is negligible compared to the gas pressure except in the ultra - cold limit where @xmath64 vanishes .",
    "therefore , we retain the gas pressure on the right of eq.([tfcurvass ] ) .",
    "the case of cold winds in which the poloidal magnetic pressure is retained is discussed in section ( [ appforcefreepolarbl ] ) .",
    "kinetic winds are characterized by @xmath65 and @xmath50 approaching zero .",
    "the hoop stress scales as @xmath66 .",
    "the gas pressure gradient term scales as @xmath67 , and the poloidal magnetic pressure force @xmath68 .",
    "again , gas pressure dominates over poloidal magnetic pressure , except for very cold winds .",
    "the hoop stress term dominates over the gas pressure force if @xmath69 .",
    "this is so in the kinetic wind solutions derived below , since @xmath50 is found to decline only as an inverse power of @xmath70 .",
    "neglecting pressure , the transfield equation ( [ tfcurvass ] ) then further reduces to : @xmath71 eq.([tfasswithoutp ] ) is equivalent to okamoto s conclusion that @xmath72 , @xmath73 being the curvature radius of poloidal field lines @xcite .",
    "note however that the centrifugal force associated with the poloidal field line curvature ( on the left of equation ( [ tfasswithoutp ] ) ) is also negligible .",
    "since the poloidal current is bounded from above , the right of equation ( [ tfasswithoutp ] ) could _ a priori _ scale as @xmath74 , but the curvature @xmath75 must decline with @xmath0 faster than @xmath74",
    ". otherwise the poloidal field lines would not be well - behaved @xcite .",
    "the left of eq.([tfasswithoutp ] ) is therefore of order @xmath76 where @xmath73 is the curvature radius , much larger than @xmath0 .",
    "to lowest order in the small parameter @xmath77 eq.([tfasswithoutp ] ) therefore reduces to the vanishing of its right - hand - side and becomes : @xmath78 this statement has been presented in @xcite as a solvability condition at infinity .",
    "it implies that almost no poloidal electric current density is present in these regions .",
    "any physical current system must be closed .",
    "current closure causes @xmath44 to depend on @xmath12 wherever current is flowing .",
    "this implies that some terms of eq.([tfcurvass ] ) should balance hoop stress where current flows .",
    "since this is not possible wherever @xmath79 , this implies that regions of current flow must take the form of boundary layers in which gradients are large .",
    "note that the hoop stress vanishes where the current vanishes .",
    "boundary layers must then occur in the vicinity of the polar axis , where @xmath80 vanishes for finite current density at the axis , and near neutral surfaces , where the hoop stress vanishes with @xmath80 .",
    "indeed , the toroidal field component is generated from the poloidal one by the rotation , but the poloidal field vanishes at a neutral surface . in the case of a dipolar symmetry",
    "the equatorial plane is a neutral surface .",
    "we then conclude that eq.([solvability ] ) applies in the field - region of the asymptotic domain , except in the boundary layers .",
    "eq.([solvability ] ) integrates along any trajectory orthogonal to magnetic surfaces as long as no null surface ( in the vicinity of which equation ( [ solvability ] ) ceases to be valid ) is met .",
    "the result is : @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a label for an orthogonal trajectory . to be specific ,",
    "we define it as being the value of the @xmath2-coordinate on this orthogonal trajectory at the polar axis .",
    "an extra label , which we omit , should precise on which segment of the orthogonal trajectory eq.([iofb ] ) applies .",
    "note that the magnetic surface label , @xmath12 , and the orthogonal trajectory label , @xmath82 , could constitute a set of orthogonal coordinates in the poloidal plane that could be substituted to @xmath0 and @xmath2 , with @xmath12 playing the role of an angular variable and @xmath82 the role of a radial distance variable .",
    "eq.([solvability ] ) states that the component of the poloidal current density parallel to @xmath83 vanishes .",
    "since @xmath84 approaches a constant ( possibly zero ) , so does also the other component of @xmath85 .",
    "thus , the hoop stress @xmath86 , approaches zero , as does @xmath87 , since @xmath88 declines rapidly with distance .",
    "hence , the lorentz force @xmath89 approaches zero .",
    "this does not imply that the field becomes force free , because this decline is due to both current and field approaching zero .",
    "it is in fact quite interesting to analyze how the different components of the lorentz force individually approach zero at large distance .",
    "this requires , however , a more precise knowledge of the solution than we have at this point .",
    "therefore this discussion is postponed to appendix [ appcomponentsoflorentz ] .",
    "we emphasize that the asymptotic regime discussed in this paper is not force - free .",
    "according to eq.([iofb ] ) , the enclosed poloidal current is approximately constant through any circuit drawn on surfaces orthogonal to magnetic surfaces and running between two successive boundary layers .",
    "the current enclosed in a circle of increasing radius drawn on one such surface would increase from zero on the polar axis to some value at the outer edge of a polar boundary layer .",
    "the current remains almost constant up to the next null - surface , at which it returns to zero ( fig [ fig1 ] ) through a boundary layer , vanishing at the null surface .",
    "needless to say , eqs.([solvability ] ) and ( [ iofb ] ) are only approximate results .",
    "we do not mean that the current density is strictly zero in field regions , but only that it is so small that the total electric current circulating between two successive boundary layers through a surface of constant-@xmath82 is much less than the current in the boundary layers themselves .",
    "nevertheless a small current in field regions must be present for @xmath90 to be a ( slowly varying ) function of @xmath82 .",
    "this picture generalizes for any number of null surfaces and the current system consists of more than just two cells ( fig [ fig2 ] ) , in each of which the electric circuit separately closes .",
    "@xmath84 approaching zero as @xmath91 means that the poloidal current circuit closes in each cell at a finite distance .",
    "by contrast , @xmath92 approaching a finite value , @xmath90 , implies that this circuit would close at infinity . in reality , the wind has not been blowing for an infinite time and it is externally bordered by a time - dependent region and an expanding shock system .",
    "this region plays the role of the `` region at infinity '' in the present stationary model : this is where the residual electric currents flow from the circumpolar region to the return - current boundary layers shown in fig.([fig2 ] ) .",
    "regions about the polar axis and the null surfaces must have the character of thin boundary layers since in the asymptotic domain , the gas pressure is a subdominant force that can balance lorentz forces only in a small region about those special places where the latter vanishes . these boundary layer sheets must be thin and there must be toroidal magnetic pressure equilibrium accross them .",
    "the total poloidal current then only changes sign at their crossing as @xmath93 reverses .",
    "our aim now is to solve the wind equations in the asymptotic domain , both in field - regions and in current - carrying boundary layers and obtain the resulting shape of the magnetic surfaces .      from eq.([tfasswithoutp ] ) , it is possible to restate eq.([solvability ] ) as an equation similar to the familiar grad - shafranoff equation of magnetohydrostatics . using the identity ( [ rotvpcrossvp ] ) of appendix [ appreductfcurvature ] and eqs.([rbthetaass ] ) , ( [ bpversusa ] ) and",
    "( [ defalpha ] ) , the equation ( [ tfasswithoutp ] ) becomes : @xmath94    the above discussion indicates that the curvature radius should be much larger than r , so that the left of eq.([transfotodel1 ] ) is negligible .",
    "expanding the divergence term and using eqs.([defalpha ] ) , ( [ bpversusa ] ) and ( [ rbthetaass ] ) to express @xmath95 , eq.([transfotodel1 ] ) is eventually brought to the form of a quasi - linear elliptic equation : @xmath96 the boundary conditions to eq.([tfassoperatorform ] ) are that @xmath97 along the polar axis and that @xmath98 on the equatorial plane .",
    "these are consistent , when @xmath44 is constant and non - zero , with @xmath12 depending only on the latitude angle @xmath99 . in this case eq.([tfassoperatorform ] ) becomes an ordinary differential equation for @xmath100 , which reduces to the form of eq.([eqpsiofageneral ] ) .",
    "eq.([tfassoperatorform ] ) is equivalent to the other forms obtained above , in particular it implies eq.([solvability ] ) .",
    "it is also equivalent to the alternative forms derived below , in particular eq.([iassgeneral ] ) . using eqs.([rbthetaass ] ) , ( [ bpversusa ] ) and ( [ defalpha ] ) , an equivalent form of eq.([tfassoperatorform ] ) is in fact found to be : @xmath101 which can be brought by denoting the normal unit vector to poloidal field lines by @xmath102 , to the form @xmath103",
    "noting that the velocity on each surface reaches a terminal velocity @xmath104 , eqs .",
    "( [ defalpha ] ) , ( [ bern ] ) and ( [ btheta ] ) reduce in the asymptotic limit to : @xmath105 @xmath106 @xmath107 eliminating @xmath108 and @xmath34 between eqs.([defalphaasympt ] ) , ( [ iasympt ] ) and ( [ bernasympt ] ) , an expression of @xmath95 is obtained : @xmath109 this relation can be integrated following orthogonal trajectories to magnetic surfaces .",
    "the curvilinear abcissa along them is denoted @xmath110 and conventionally increases from pole to equator , so that @xmath111 .",
    "( [ rgradaofigeneral ] ) becomes @xmath112 in field - regions , eq .",
    "( [ fluxversuscurvilinear ] ) simplifies , since @xmath113 becomes a function @xmath84 independent of @xmath12 .",
    "it can be restated as : @xmath114 if @xmath84 were to approach a non - vanishing value @xmath90 at large distances from the wind source , this equation would explicitly give the flux distribution in space in the asymptotic domain .",
    "particular versions of eq.([iassgeneral ] ) for cylindrical or conical magnetic surfaces have in fact been obtained and solved in our earlier work @xcite .",
    "( [ iassgeneral ] ) improves on this by not being restricted to either one of these specific geometries .",
    "it implies no _ a priori _ constraints on the structure of the solution and keeps a fully 2-dimensional character . in the asymptotic field - region ,",
    "far from the neutral surfaces and from the polar axis , the transfield equation reduces to eq.([iassgeneral ] ) with constant @xmath84 , which is of the hamilton - jacobi type : @xmath115 by defining @xmath116 , it can be converted into @xmath117    this equation can be restated as @xmath118 , implying that @xmath119 .",
    "this , with eq.([divnoverr ] ) , indicates that @xmath120 should be an harmonic function .",
    "the solution for @xmath120 represented by eq.([eqpsiofageneral ] ) is harmonic .",
    "if the poloidal electric current @xmath84 declines towards zero at large distances , the function on the right of eq.([hamjacoba ] ) also depends on @xmath82 .",
    "eq.([iassgeneral ] ) then does not provide the value of the modulus @xmath121 as a function of @xmath12 and @xmath0 ( as does eq.([hamjacoba ] ) ) because it is not known how @xmath84 declines with @xmath82 .",
    "this difficulty can however be circumvented if this variation is so slow that it can be treated , as we do below , by a wkbj type of approach .",
    "note that the case when @xmath84 approaches a non - zero limit , can be dealt with by a wkbj procedure as well , since @xmath84 is not strictly constant , but slowly evolves towards its limit .",
    "important features of the asymptotic structure , in particular the difficult question of the connexion between the asymptotically cylindrical and the asymptotically conical regions , must be approached by considering the non - constancy of @xmath84 as it approaches its limit .",
    "particular solutions to the hamilton - jacobi equation ( [ hamjacoba ] ) for constant @xmath84 can be found by the method of separation of variables .",
    "these are described in appendix [ apppartsolhamjacob ] , although the boundary conditions associated to some of them are different from those we are facing .",
    "these solutions however exemplify a number of typical structures to which eq.([hamjacoba ] ) may give rise .",
    "general solutions associated with the boundary conditions relevant to the case of astrophysical mhd winds can be found by reduction of eq.([hamjacobs ] ) to a ray - tracing problem .",

    "the wave fronts are represented by surfaces of constant @xmath124 .",
    "they may be found by ray - tracing methods , the rays being the orthogonal trajectories to the surfaces .",
    "so , finding the general solution of eq.([hamjacobs ] ) is equivalent to solving snell s refraction equation .",
    "we show in appendix ( [ appsnell ] ) the equivalence of the hamilton - jacobi equation with snell s equation .",
    "the polar and the equatorial lines , being field lines , must be lines of constant @xmath120 .",
    "the boundary condition to eq.([hamjacobs ] ) is that rays start perpendicular to the pole and the equator . in the vicinity of a null surface ( e.g. the equator ) , the simplified asymptotic transfield equation ( [ solvability ] ) is invalid .",
    "we show in section ( [ subsecexit ] ) and in appendix [ appangleofexitfromeqbl ] that the angle of the magnetic field lines to the equator at the outskirts of this boundary layer decreases to zero with increasing @xmath82 , justifying the view that rays from the field - region must nevertheless end perpendicular to it .",
    "similar considerations apply to the vicinity of the pole and to other null surfaces : rays must also cross them perpendicularly on both sides .",
    "this optical analogy can be used to find the general solution eq.([hamjacobs ] ) by writing the appropriate form of snell s law .",
    "the gradient of the refraction index is in this case perpendicular to the polar axis .",

    "the ray - tracing equations can be written as : @xmath126 where @xmath127 is a constant .",
    "unlike the boundary condition at the equator , the condition that @xmath125 approaches zero at the polar axis is not restrictive because @xmath128 , being equal to @xmath74 , diverges there . equations ( [ snell ] ) can be integrated to : @xmath129 where @xmath130 and @xmath127 are two integration constants .",

    "nevertheless we believe that the electric circuit picture which emerges from our analysis should be robust against relaxing a number of these assumptions .",

    "forces competing with hoop stress must also remain small under rather general conditions and are probably confined to spatially limited regions . by contrast , the distribution of flux in the different boundary layers would be modified by the consideration of non - ideal effects , such as turbulence resulting from the development of non axisymmetric mhd instabilities . the stationnarity assumption is valid on a scale smaller than the size of the cavity carved by the wind in the ambient medium .",

    "let @xmath440 be the value of the parameter @xmath245 which corresponds to the outer edge of the equatorial boundary layer .",
    "@xmath440 may be taken as equal to @xmath441 or @xmath442 , say .",
    "assuming @xmath14 to be well approximated in this region by eq.([divalpha ] ) with @xmath229 , the flux parameter @xmath443 of the magnetic surface which exits the boundary layer at @xmath82 is given by @xmath444 incidently this shows that the residual flux in the equatorial boundary layer declines with distance @xmath82 .",
    "the partial derivative @xmath445 calculated at @xmath446 is the slope of the poloidal field line which exits the equatorial boundary layer at @xmath82 .",
    "it is given in terms of @xmath82 and @xmath2 by @xmath447 using eq.([aexit ] ) and eqs.([behaverhoequat])-([zofrequatoroutskirt ] ) , the following expression is obtained : @xmath448 this slope approaches zero as @xmath82 approaches infinity , as needed for consistency of our analysis in section [ subsecraytracing ] , in particular for supporting the idea that orthogonal trajectories to magnetic surfaces become closer and closer to centered spheres as their radius increases .",
    "all components of @xmath449 and @xmath450 approach zero at large distances , though not at the same rate . in the field - region , @xmath83 , given by eq.([bpversusa ] ) , declines with spherical distance as @xmath451 , while @xmath452 may decline slower than @xmath453 , depending on the shape of magnetic surfaces .",
    "the toroidal current density is : @xmath454 it declines as @xmath52 , which may be slower than @xmath455 depending on the geometry of magnetic surfaces . the poloidal current density @xmath85 has a component @xmath456 orthogonal to magnetic surfaces and a component @xmath457 along them .",
    "the latter is constrained by eq.([solvability ] ) to vanish , keeping the same approximation ( or ordering ) at which eq.([solvability ] ) itself is valid .",
    "the discussion of section ( [ dominantforces ] ) has shown that the gradient of gas pressure causes @xmath457 to deviate from zero , such that @xmath458 the component @xmath456 is approximately : @xmath459 the magnitude of @xmath460 depends on how @xmath84 converges to its limit .",
    "if this limit is zero , @xmath90 is given by eqs.([bennetparab])([nzeroofrsimple ] ) .",
    "if the limit is the minimum @xmath461 of the function @xmath146 , an expansion of eq.([facteur ] ) for @xmath90 close to @xmath461 can be made resulting in @xmath462 when substituted in eq.([nzeroofrsimple ] ) it is found that @xmath90 is given by @xmath463 where @xmath464 is usually a small exponent .",
    "it is then deduced that for kinetic winds @xmath465 while for poynting jets @xmath466 eqs.([jperpforkinetic ] ) and ( [ jperpforpoynting ] ) indicate that @xmath467 where @xmath468 is a slowly increasing function .",
    "we can now describe how the different components of the lorentz force decline with distance on different magnetic surfaces .",
    "the shape of these surfaces matters , since the relation between the cylindrical distance @xmath0 and the radial distance @xmath82 depends on it .",
    "it is found that @xmath469 @xmath470 @xmath471 @xmath472    the component of the lorentz force accelerating the fluid along field lines @xmath473 , diminishes most slowly with distance .",
    "this is particularly true for kinetic winds , as expected , since these transform all of their poynting energy into kinetic energy .",
