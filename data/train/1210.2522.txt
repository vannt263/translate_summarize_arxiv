    "in recent years , long haul optical communication through fibers has attracted considerable interest in research activities among scientists all over the world . especially , it has been demonstrated that the soliton - type pulse propagation will play a vital role in the ultra fast communication systems .",
    "they are considered to be the futuristic tools in achieving low - loss , cost - effective high speed communication throughout the world .",
    "soliton - type pulse propagation through nonlinear optical fibers is realized by means of the exact counterbalance between the major constraints of the fiber , viz . , group velocity dispersion ( linear effect ) which broadens the pulse and the self - phase modulation ( nonlinear effect ) which contracts the pulse .",
    "the propagation of optical pulses through a nonlinear fiber in the picosecond regime is described by the well - known nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation , which was first proposed by hasegawa and tappert in 1973@xcite .    to make the soliton based communication systems highly competitive , reliable and economical when compared to the conventional systems , attenuation in a fiber",
    "must be compensated .",
    "a different type of optical soliton is associated with the self - induced transparency ( sit ) effect in resonant absorbers . the soliton pulse propagation in an erbium doped fiber amplifier utilizes the sit phenomena , first discovered by mccall and hahn@xcite . in 1967 ,",
    "mccall and hahn proposed a new type of optical soliton in a two level resonant system . above a well - defined threshold intensity",
    ", short resonant pulses of a given duration will propagate through a normally absorbing medium with anomalously low attenuation .",
    "this happens when the pulse width is short , compared to the relaxation times in the medium and the pulse centre frequency is in resonance with a two - level absorbing transition .",
    "after a few classical absorption lengths , the pulse achieves a steady state in which its width , energy and shape remain constant .",
    "the pulse velocity has greatly reduced from the normal velocity of light in such media . with these properties , the pulse propagation of this type",
    "is named `` self - induced transparency '' ( sit ) soliton and frequently described by the maxwell - bloch ( mb ) equations .",
    "they are @xmath4 here , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are complex variables , @xmath2 is a real variable and @xmath5 is a real constant and @xmath6 is the character describing the interaction between the resonant atoms and the optical field .",
    "the symbol * denotes the complex conjugate .",
    "these equations can be extended to the case of fiber amplifiers .",
    "when er is doped with the core of the optical fibres , then the nonlinear wave propagation can have both the effects due to silica and er impurities .",
    "er impurities give sit effect to the optical pulse , whereas the silica material gives the nls soliton effect .",
    "so if we consider these effects for a large width pulse , then the system dynamics will be governed by the coupled system of the nls equation and the mb equation ( nls - mb system ) .",
    "considering the erbium doped in nonlinear silica waveguides , for the first time , the combined nls - mb system was proposed by maimistov and manykin @xcitein 1983 .",
    "they have also constructed the lax pair and used the inverse scattering transform technique for the generation of soliton solution .",
    "the nls - mb equations read as@xcite    @xmath7 + 2p ,",
    "\\nonumber\\\\   p_x= & 2i\\ \\omega_0 p+ 2e\\eta,\\nonumber\\\\   \\eta_x= & -(e p^ * + e^ * p),\\label{nls - mb }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the above equation have also been reduced through the painleve analysis @xcite .",
    "further , kakei and satsuma @xcite also reported the lax pair and the multi - soliton solution of the nls - mb equations .",
    "the integrability aspects of nls - mb system with variable dispersion , the study of propagation of optical solitons in coupled nls - mb , and random nonuniform - doped media have been reported earlier wherein the spectral parameter was kept constant .",
    "the coexistence of nls soliton and sit soliton has already been confirmed experimentally@xcite .",
    "the propagation and switching of sit in nonlinear directional couplers with two - level atom nonlinearity has been recently investigated numerically by retaining the transverse dependence of the optical field and atomic variable .",
    "recent experiments by nakazawa _",
    "_ , have confirmed guided wave sit soliton formation and propagation by employing a few meters of erbium doped fibre @xcite .    recently , considering all higher order effects in the propagation of femtosecond pulses , the coupled hirota and maxwell - bloch ( ch - mb ) equations have been proposed and analyzed for soliton solutions @xcite .",
    "some generalization of nls - mb equations , for instance , the ch - mb equations and the nls - mb equations with variable dispersion and nonlinear effects are discussed @xcite . the single soliton and the single breather solutions@xcite of the nls - mb equations",
    "are given by the darboux transformation ( dt)@xcite .",
    "soliton solution for the generalized coupled variable coefficient nls - mb system was also investigated by the dt @xcite and the hirota method @xcite .    in recent years , in addition to solitons in different optical systems , the study of rogue waves have also attracted considerable interest because of their potential applications in different branches of physics including oceanography@xcite , which occurs due to either modulation instability @xcite , or random initial condition @xcite .",
    "the first order rogue wave is most likely to appear as a single peak hump with two caves in a plane with a nonzero boundary .",
    "one of the possible generating mechanisms for rogue waves is the creation of breathers which can be realized by modulation instability .",
    "then , larger rogue waves can build up when two or more breathers collide themselves@xcite .",
    "recently , more general higher - order rogue waves were obtained such as showing that these general n - th order rogue waves contain @xmath8 free irreducible complex parameters@xcite .",
    "rogue waves can also be observed in space plasmas@xcite and optics when propagating high power optical radiation through photonic crystal fibers @xcite . considering all higher order effects in the propagation of femtosecond pulses , rogue waves",
    "can also be observed in a system modeled by the hirota equation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , rogue waves have not only been observed in continuous media but have also been reported in discrete systems , such as the systems of the well - known ablowitz - ladik ( a - l ) equation @xcite .",
    "though the rogue waves have been reported in different branches of physics where the system dynamics is governed by single equation , to the best our knowledge , they have been observed and reported very little in the coupled systems .",
    "for example , rogue waves of the coupled nls were constructed in the literatures @xcite . very recently , new kinds of matter rogue waves @xcite have been reported in @xmath9 spinor bose - einstein condensate system controlled by three component nls equation . in experiment ,",
    "the rogue waves in a multistable system @xcite is revealed by experiments with an erbium - doped fiber laser driven by harmonic pump modulation .",
    "so , it is our prime interest to analyze the possibility of rogue waves in coupled systems , such as nls - mb system .",
    "+ it is well known that the dark soliton @xcite of the defocusing nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation is essentially different from that of bright soliton . for the past two decades or so",
    ", intensive research have been carried by several groups about theoretical and experimental aspects of dark bright solitons , it is quite natural to ask a question : is there any possibility of observing dark rouge wave in soliton equations ?",
    "in general , the first order dark rogue wave has one down dominant peak and two small lumps .",
    "because of the singularity @xcite of the solution for the de - focusing nls equation generated by using dt , we can not get dark rogue wave of the de - focusing by this way .",
    "fortunately , we have obtained dark and bright rogue waves@xcite of the nls - mb equations from a taylor series expansion of the first order breather solutions , which are generated from a periodic seed by the dt .",
    "but we did not provide a detailed analysis on their dynamical evolution and higher order rogue waves .",
    "the aim of this paper is twofold .",
    "firstly , the determinant representation of the n - fold dt of the nls - mb equations are similar to the case of nls equation dt@xcite .",
    "secondly , the rogue waves of the three optical fields are constructed by determinant forms .",
    "it should be noted that the rogue waves of the fields @xmath1 and @xmath2 are dark .",
    "furthermore , the connection between our rogue waves and the generation of supercontinuum generation will be discussed .",
    "+ the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2 , the determinant representation of the n - fold dt and formulae of @xmath10}$ ] , @xmath11}$ ] and",

    "are generated by n - fold dt from a periodic seed solution with a constant amplitude to construct the bright and dark rogue waves .",
    "what is more , the n - order rogue waves are given by determinant forms with @xmath3 free parameters .",
