    "the distinguished behavior of superfluid to carry angular momentum have attracted people s attention from long ago .",
    "it is well known that vortex excitation plays an important role when a superfluid responds to the external rotation . nowadays ,",
    "the vigorous development in cold atom physics has provided a new and more favorable arena to prove many theoretical predictions of rotating superfluid s behavior .",
    "it has been clearly demonstrated by many recent experiments that the vortex will be a stable excitation with quite long life - time when sufficient angular momentum is imparted , and the vortex lattice will be generated when even more angular momentum is brought to this system .",
    "besides the vortex itself , the vortex dipole , i.e. , a bound vortex - antivortex pair , is also of particular interest .",
    "it is well known that the low - lying behavior of two - dimensional helium superfluid is dominated by vortex dipole , for the excitation energy of a vortex dipole is much smaller than a single vortex . with the increase of temperature",
    ", the vortex pairs will become unbounded and vortices will be free .",
    "this will lead to a phase transition known as kosterlize - thouless(kt ) transition .",
    "although no vortex - antivortex pair has yet been observed directly so far in atomic bose - einstein condensate(bec ) , it is natural to presume that vortex dipole may play an important role when the imparted angular momentum is not large enough to support the vortex excitation .",
    "so it is worthwhile to study the properties of vortex dipole excitation in an atomic bec .",
    "the existence and importance of vortex dipole in an atomic bec are also indicated by some recent experiments and numerical simulations .",
    "mit group stirred the bec locally with the stirring frequency which was too small to generate any surface mode , however , they observed a large number of vortices after stirring for some time .",
    "this suggested a local mechanism of generating vortex , say through vortex dipole excitation@xcite .",
    "recently some numerical calculation also indicated that stable vortex dipole could exist in a trapped atom bec for a broad range of parameters@xcite .",
    "all of these lead us to believe that cold atom physics will offer people opportunity to investigate this intricate vortex dipole excitation in superfluid .",
    "what is more , the characteristics of trapped atomic bec will add much richer physics content to the properties of vortex dipoles , as well as to the experimental detection and production of vortex dipoles , which will be emphasized in this paper .    to proceed in this interesting and meaningful research field ,",
    "we of course should first make clear the properties of a single vortex dipole in bec , i.e. , its angular momentum and energy . in section",
    "ii , we will first deduce an exact result of its angular momentum and energy .",
    "it is not trivial to calculate the angular momentum and energy of vortex dipole in an inhomogeneous condensate .",
    "here we use an integration method in complex coordinate to obtain fully analytical results , which will be described explicitly in this section and the appendix .",
    "we then apply our results to investigate mit group experiment@xcite . through our calculations , we provide strong evidence to support the presence of vortex dipole during this kind of vortex nucleation process , and suggest further experiment to confirm this mechanism .    for experimental study the properties of vortex dipole in details , an effective way to generate and detect it is required . although various methods have been widely adopted to produce vortices successfully , the formation of vortex dipole has not been systematically discussed . in section iii",
    ", we will suggest that jila s method@xcite , which generate vortex through a coherent spatial and temporal coupling between two - component bec , could also be used to produce vortex dipole .",
    "measuring the density distribution could demonstrate the density depression in the neighborhood of the vortex center but have nothing to do with its phase .",
    "the same problem will be encountered in the case of vortex dipole . we could not distinguish which vortex is positive or negative only from the density image .",
    "what is more , the velocity field of a vortex dipole decreases quickly from the dipole center , and any closed path , which is a little far from the vortex dipole and includes both the vortex and antivortex , will be quite similar with the case that there is no singularity at all in this area .",
    "it is also not so effective to use interference method to reveal the phase information of vortex dipole as in vortex case@xcite .",
    "however , experimentalists now could accurately measure the frequency splitting of the collective modes when the time reversal symmetry is broken due to the presence of vortices .",
    "this splitting will clearly distinguish vortex dipole from single vortex and vortex - free states . in theory , there are usually two ways to calculate the frequency of the collective mode in presence of vortices , one is perturbative calculation and the other is the sum rule approach .",
    "the results obtained from these two approaches are in good agreement with each other when the vortex is in the center of condensate . however , they are no more consistent when the vortex is off - center as pointed out in ref.@xcite . in section iv , we first use perturbation approximation to calculate the frequency splitting of the collective mode , and then we explain why the sum rule approach fails here . a brief conclusion and discussion",
    "will be given in the last section .",
    "we hereafter consider a bec confined in a pancake harmonic trap , which allows us to deal with a quasi - two - dimensional system .",
    "the gross - pitaevski equation in a non - rotating coordinate frame is @xmath0 where @xmath1 , and @xmath2 is the effective quasi - two - dimensional interaction strength , obtained by integrating the usual three dimensional one @xmath3 over the @xmath4 direction . as we are considering the small angular momentum case , we could start with the thomas - fermi(t - f ) approximation .",
    "so the density distribution of the ground state is well known as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the t - f radius .",
    "once a vortex dipole appears , in the region outside of vortex core we can write @xmath7 with @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the angle of @xmath10 with respect to @xmath11 axis . @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the positions of vortex and antivortex respectively",
    ". eq.([wavefunction ] ) follows from the assumption that the presence of vortices will not change the density distribution of the condensate but only introduce a phase , except inside the vortex core .",
    "this is true when the vortex core @xmath14 is small in the t - f region . with eq.([wavefunction ] ) we could calculate the angular momentum of the condensate as @xmath15 only in the region @xmath16 , @xmath17 will change @xmath18 after going along a circle . thus , @xmath19 we notice that the energy of a vortex dipole increases with their distance , and the most efficient way to carry angular momentum is that @xmath12 and @xmath13 direct along the same radius , namely they are fully polarized , as are schematically shown in fig([fig : dipoleconfig ] ) .",
    "so we could denote @xmath20,@xmath21 , therefore @xmath22 where @xmath23 is @xmath24 .",
    "now we turn to the energy of the vortex dipole . in the t - f region , it could be written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 here we have neglected the presence of mirror dipole due to the edge effect , which would be a good approximation in a broad region except when the dipole is very close to the boundary of the condensate . for convenience , we do all the calculation in complex coordinates .",
    "we will use @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and then obtain @xmath29 according to the green formula @xmath30 we could obtain the energy expression in the region @xmath31 @xmath32\\ln\\frac{d}{\\lambda}.\\label{e}\\ ] ] the detailed calculations are given in appendix b. as the energy is dependent on @xmath33 logarithmically , the vortex and antivortex should bind up to each other closely , and we could neglect higher orders of @xmath34 . compared with the well known result for homogenous case , we also find that in eq.([e])the homogenous density is replaced by local density at the position of vortex dipole .",
    "it can be easily understood because the amplitude of the velocity field of vortex dipole falls rapidly from the center of the vortex dipole , and most contribution to the energy of a dipole comes from the local velocity field .",
    "it is of long standing interest to investigate the intrinsic mechanism of vortex nucleation since the study of helium superfluid . in ref.@xcite dynamic nucleation of vortices in a trapped atomic bec",
    "was studied experimentally .",
    "when the condensate was stirred by a laser with the beam waist comparable to the t - f radius , the condensate was globally rotated . in this case",
    "they found an enhanced vortex generation when the stirring frequency coincides that of surface excitations .",
    "it is indicated that vortex could be generated through surface excitation .",
    "however , when the condensate was stirred locally by a small beam , and the stirring frequency was far below any surface excitation frequency , they also found large number of vortices .",
    "this phenomenon suggested that the vortex can also be created locally in the bulk of the condensate , which seems to be in conflict with the topological argument , unless the vortex dipole was excited as an intermediate step . with the increase of angular momentum ,",
    "the anti - vortices will finally be expelled out from the system and leave only the vortices in the condensate .",
    "a remarkable feature of the local nucleation is that the vortex number produced by this local stirring is strongly dependent on the distance @xmath35 between stirring position and the center of condensate .",
    "the vortex number presents a maximum in the region where the ratio of @xmath35 to the condensate size @xmath6 is around @xmath36 .",
    "hence , a question can be raised that whether we can understand the maximum from the properties of vortex dipole excitation .    our answer to",
    "this question is , it is just in this region that the excitation energy of vortex dipole takes a minimum . in other word , the vortex dipole is easiest to be excited in this region . with eq.([l ] ) and eq.([e ] ) in hand , we could calculate the energy as a function of the position of vortex dipole @xmath37 for a given small value of angular momentum @xmath38 .",
    "the result is @xmath39,\\label{ed}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 denoting @xmath41 is introduced as an energy unit .",
    "here we should emphasize that the vortex core size @xmath14 also depends on @xmath42 via @xmath43    this result is plotted in fig([fig : e1 ] ) .",
    "we could clearly see that the energy minimum occurs at @xmath42 around @xmath36 .",
    "our calculation thus provides a support to the vortex dipole mechanism .     respectively , where @xmath44,width=288 ]    to further confirm the vortex dipole mechanism",
    ", we investigate the properties of vortex dipole in an anharmonic trap @xmath45 the angular momentum and energy of the vortex dipole will become @xmath46,\\ ] ] and @xmath47\\ln\\frac{d}{\\lambda}.\\ ] ] where @xmath48 .     respectively , and @xmath49 is fixed at 0.05,width=288 ]    we find that with the increase of the quartic term , the minimum in the @xmath50 curve moves toward larger value of @xmath42 as shown in fig.([fig : e2 ] . hence we predict that the stirring position where the number of generated vortices reaches its maximum will also change correspondingly , if a similar experiment is performed in an anharmonic trap .",
    "let us first briefly review the vortex formation by phase imprinting method@xcite , which used a laser to couple a two - component bec .",
    "when we write the order parameter @xmath51 as @xmath52 , where @xmath53 , we could map the wave function to a pseudo - spin @xmath54 on a bloch sphere . under the optical coupling",
    ", the pseudo - spin will rotate with the effective rabi oscillation frequency @xmath55 . in the experiment",
    "the laser was locally applied and moved around a circle with the frequency @xmath56 , and the condensate in different points acquires a phase difference proportional to @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the time interval of the laser passing through these two points . if @xmath59 , the phase difference between the two points is identical to @xmath60 , and the phase configuration of a vortex is built up .",
    "besides , if we only change the sign of @xmath55 and keep the circling direction of the laser unchanged , an anti - vortex will be produced .    extending the above method to dipole generation",
    "is straightforward . from fig.([fig : generation ] ) , we can see that the velocity field of a vortex dipole is clockwise in left plane and anti - clockwise in right plane . to produce a vortex dipole ,",
    "the moving laser is required to change the sign of @xmath55 once it crosses the @xmath61 axis .",
    "what is more , the phase configuration of the vortex dipole could be produced exactly .",
    "@xmath55 , the velocity of the moving laser @xmath62 and the phase change gradient of the vortex dipole @xmath63 should satisfy the relationship @xmath64 everywhere along the circle .",
    "@xmath17 denotes dipole phase expression eq.([dipolephase ] ) .     denotes the velocity of the moving laser , width=345 ]    once the phase along the circle is fixed , according to the uniqueness of solution to the equation @xmath65",
    ", the two phase singularities , as well as the phase elsewhere inside the circle will consequently be determined .",
    "when the ground state of the condensate possesses time reversal symmetry , the @xmath66 collective modes will be degenerate . however ,",
    "once the time reversal symmetry is broken due to the presence of vortex , the frequencies of the two modes will split .",
    "zambelli and stringari used the sum rule approach to obtain an analytical result of this splitting when a single vortex lies in the center of the condensate@xcite .",
    "svidzinsky and fetter also obtained a consistent result by solving the the hydrodynamic equations with perturbational approximation@xcite .",
    "they both found that the frequency splitting is proportional to the total angular momentum carried by the condensate .",
    "later the frequency splitting when the vortex is off - center was also calculated pertubatively@xcite@xcite .",
    "they found that the result obtained from the sum rule approach does not agree with that from the perturbative approach any more . in this section , we will first calculate the collective mode splitting in presence of a vortex dipole from the perturbation approximation , and we find the similar disagreement between perturbation approach and the sum rule approach will also occur here .",
    "we will briefly discuss the reason why the sum rule approach fails to meet the result of perturbative approach .",
    "we should point out that it is not the sum rule itself but the incorrect way we use it that leads to this failure .      substituting @xmath67 into eq.([g - p ] ) , we could obtain the well known hydrodynamic equations in the t - f region .",
    "@xmath68 where @xmath69 .",
    "expanding @xmath70 and @xmath71 with @xmath72 and after linearization , we could obtain the equation for collective modes @xmath73.\\label{linearization}\\ ] ] we notice that the left hand of eq.([linearization ] ) is just the equation of collective motion corresponding to a vortex - free ground state .",
    "and we also note that the effect of @xmath74 to the collective modes is always small , because @xmath74 decreases quickly from the vortex dipole center as @xmath75 while @xmath76 increases from the condensation center as @xmath77 , their overlapping is always small except the position of the vortex dipole is nearby the boundary .",
    "so we could treat the right hand side as perturbation safely and obtain @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the collective mode frequency in a vortex free case .",
    "hereafter we consider the following surface mode @xmath80 from the calculation presented in appendix c , we could obtain the splitting between @xmath81 mode and @xmath82 mode as @xmath83.\\label{result}\\ ] ] in experiments , from the optical absorption image the vortices positions @xmath84 and @xmath85 can be determined , and then by measuring the frequency splitting and comparing the obtained result with eq.([result ] ) , one can distinguish a vortex dipole from two vortices with the same winding directions .",
    "when we apply the formulism of ref.@xcite to calculate the frequency splitting of @xmath86 modes , we can not obtain the same result as eq.([result ] ) . to understand the reasons ,",
    "let us first briefly remind ourself of the sum rules approach .",
    "the general formula of the sum rules for an arbitrary operator @xmath87 can be easily proved as @xmath88|k\\rangle}{2},\\\\ \\sum_n(e_n - e_k)^3\\left|\\mathcal{f}_{nk}\\right|^2=\\frac{\\langle k|[[\\mathcal{f^+},h],[h,[h,\\mathcal{f}]]]|k\\rangle}{2}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we choose @xmath89 , and with a particular choice of the operator @xmath87 which satisfies @xmath90 , we could obtain @xmath91,[h,[h,\\mathcal{f}]]]|0\\rangle}{\\langle 0|[\\mathcal{f^+},[h,\\mathcal{f}]]|0\\rangle}\\label{sumrule}.\\ ] ] this is a powerful method because we can obtain the excitation energy directly from the property of the ground state without the explicit wavefunction of excitation state .",
    "however , the successful application of the sum rule approach relies on the proper choice of @xmath87 , which should excite the ground state to only one definitive excited state .",
    "when the system possesses some particular symmetry , we may easily find out a suitable @xmath87 .",
    "that s true when there is a central vortex , as rotation invariance is still present and the excited state should also have the form @xmath92 .",
    "so we could easily select @xmath87 as @xmath93 to make use of the sum rule .",
    "however , the rotation invariance is broken in the case of vortex dipole . the choice of @xmath87 still as @xmath93 will excite several states , and eq.([sumrule ] ) will not tenable .",
    "that s why the sum rule approach fails to agree with the perturbative result in ref.@xcite .",
    "in summary , by applying a convenient integration method in complex coordinate , we have obtained the fully analytic expressions of the angular momentum and energy of a vortex dipole in a trapped bec .",
    "we also suggest an effective method to generate and detect the vortex dipole .",
    "our work may provide a starting point for the research in the problem of vortex dipole excitation .",
    "there still remains many interesting fundamental issues in both theoretical and experimental physics , such as its dynamics , stability and detailed generation mechanism .",
    "the precession of off - center vortex in a trapped condensate has been fully investigated both in experiment and theory .",
    "the mutual interaction between vortex and antivortex is presumed to bring a more nontrivial trajectory for vortex dipole . on the other hand ,",
    "its dynamic behavior is closely related to its stability . in the dual electromagnetic picture@xcite , the positive and negative charge ,",
    "to which the vortex dipole corresponds , will tend to annihilate each other via electromagnetic radiation , say phonon excitation in original picture .",
    "however , in a trapped condensate , there are two mechanism to stabilize the vortex dipole , one is the angular momentum conservation , and the other is the discrete spectrum of the the phonon in a finite system .",
    "investigation of this interesting competition will reveal the underlying physics of the numerical simulation@xcite .",
    "the fundamental mechanism of generating vortex dipole from a local stirring is even more complex , and it may resemble the birth of electron and positron from the vacuum polarization of the electromagnetic field .",
    "another important issue which should also arouse great attention is the complex phase diagram of rotating two - dimensional superfluid .",
    "when the angular momentum l equals zero , the critical temperature @xmath94 for k - t transition is well understood .",
    "but when the superfluid carries a certain angular momentum , the dependence of @xmath94 to the angular momentum , as far as we are concerned , hasnt been clearly revealed . on the other hand , with the increase of angular momentum",
    ", the vortex dipoles will break into free vortices , and finally stable vortex excitation will become dominative .",
    "however , the explicit mechanism of the transition from vortex dipole excitation to stable vortex excitation is also still unknown .",
    "the interplay of the angular momentum and the thermal excitation will bring rich physics to the rotating two - dimensional superfluid .",
