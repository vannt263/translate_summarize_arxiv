    "the said paper by mustafa  @xcite and an earlier article by mustafa and thoma  @xcite were aimed at expanding further the pioneering works by baier et al . ,  @xcite and mller  @xcite on the important phenomenon of jet quenching , i.e. , the suppression of hadronic spectra produced by partons ( having large transverse momentum ) which suffer sizable energy loss while traveling in a hot and dense quark - gluon plasma",
    "@xcite attempted to fulfil this aim by explaining the relevant physical mechanisms , recalling the expressions of collisional & radiative energy loss rates predicted by finite - temperature qcd , setting up a fokker - planck transport equation for massless or massive partons , solving the partial differential equation analytically by using fourier transform together with the method of characteristics , and plotting the predicted quenching factor @xmath1 and @xmath2 ratio graphically for a bjorken expanding qgp expected to have been produced in ultra - relativistic au@xmath3au collisions at rhic . unfortunately , as we show below through the present comment , there are many questions which are either ignored or not clarified properly in the works of  @xcite .",
    "although the emphasis of  @xcite was on the massive charmed quark yet our discussion of various controversial questions becomes easiest in the massless case . employing @xmath4 units",
    "let the leading parton moving in the transverse , i.e. , x direction be associated with mass @xmath5 , initial momentum @xmath6 , initial energy @xmath7 , travel time @xmath8 , distance covered @xmath9 , residual momentum variable @xmath10 , residual energy variable @xmath11 , collisional momentum loss variable @xmath12 , energy loss variable @xmath13 , drag coefficient @xmath14 , diffusion coefficient @xmath15 , useful integral @xmath16 , average momentum @xmath17 , useful kinematic symbol @xmath18 , and time dependent variance @xmath19 defined by @xmath20 @xmath21 _ the first lacuna of  @xcite is that they contain mix - up of notations like @xmath22 at several spots [ e.g. , eq .",
    "( 3 ) of ref . ( 1 ) ] and also they fail to mention the fact that @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 in the massive ( @xmath0 ) parton case_. one may argue that , since jet quenching is a high - energy phenomenon with @xmath26 gev typically , hence the charm quark mass @xmath27 gev can be ignored .",
    "this argument , however , is untenable because the fundamental quantity derived in  @xcite was the probability distribution @xmath28 which must be computed even down to @xmath29 and plotted from @xmath30 gev onwards [ fig . 4 of ref . 1 ] .",
    "in these regions the charm quark mass can not be neglected , i.e. , the care @xmath31 and @xmath25 should have been exercised in  @xcite .",
    "refs .  @xcite are based on the fundamental transport equation [ see eq . ( 35 ) of ref . 1 ]",
    "@xmath32 where the transport coefficients are treated as momentum - independent according to the classical view and a suffix @xmath33 has been attached to the one - body distribution @xmath34 for the sake of clarity .",
    "imposing @xmath35 initial condition the unique solution of ( c3 ) is found to be [ see eq .",
    "( 42 ) of ref . 1 ] @xmath36 where the exponential contains purely the second power of @xmath37 .",
    "unfortunately , the conventional version ( c3 ) of the fp equation can not properly describe relativistic brownian particle .",
    "the ( @xmath38)-dimensional covariant langevin dynamics  @xcite leads to a new fp equation in the massive case as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the hnggi - dnkel distribution function , @xmath14 and @xmath41 may be taken as momentum - independent coefficients , and the replacement @xmath42 is to be done in the massless limit . _",
    "the second lacuna of  @xcite is that they did not employ the relativistically logical transport equation ( c5 ) and also did not seek different type of time - dependent solution @xmath43 in which the exponential may contain @xmath44 linearly . _",
    "even if the solution ( c4 ) in momentum variable is assumed to be valid yet care must be exercised while transforming to the energy language . we know that both the points @xmath47 are mapped into the same @xmath48 .",
    "hence , by standard mathematical statistics , the probability distribution in @xmath46 would read @xmath49 which is automatically even in @xmath45 and preserves the total probability in the sense that @xmath50    unfortunately , for non - zero @xmath17 , the piece @xmath51 itself is not even in @xmath45 , it can not represent the probability function over the positive @xmath46 axis , and its normalization integral is awkward namely @xmath52 with erfc being the complimentary error function  @xcite . _",
    "the third lacuna of  @xcite is that they wrongly assumed the energy - space probability function to be simply @xmath53 [ see eq .",
    "( 28 ) of ref .",
    "2 ] which contradicts the logical expression ( c6 ) and also yields awkward normalization ( c7 ) . _",
    "suppose the philosophy of  @xcite is applied to a thought situation where the massless brownian particle is embedded in a huge thermal bath at finite ambient temperature @xmath54 .",
    "keeping in mind the definitions ( c2,c4 ) we expect that at instants large compared to relaxation time @xmath55 @xmath56 _ the fourth lacuna of  @xcite is that the equilibrium distribution of their test particles does not tend towards the massless maxwellian form as @xmath57 even if bose / fermi statistics are ignored . _",
    "it is known that the correct asymptotic maxwellian is retrieved if stationary solution is sought for the dnkel - hnggi  @xcite version of the fp equation ( c5 ) .",
    "suppose the energy space distribution function for @xmath58 is just assumed to be @xmath53 ( which it is not ) .",
    "then , by making the transformation @xmath59 the average energy of the brownian particle would read @xmath60 where erfc stands for the complementary error function  @xcite .",
    "clearly , @xmath61 only if @xmath62 .",
    "_ the fifth lacuna of  @xcite is that , instead of ( c11 ) , they report the average energy as simply @xmath63 _ [ see eq .",
    "( 31 ) of ref .",
    "2 ] without mentioning any restriction on the ratio @xmath64 . of course",
    ", if the correct distribution @xmath65 defined by ( c6 ) were used the corresponding mean energy would become @xmath66 rigorously .",
    "let the shorthand notation @xmath67 denote the @xmath68 distribution of hadrons produced by a jet of energy @xmath46 after covering a distance @xmath69 . then , assuming again the probability distribution to be @xmath70 ( which it is not ) the medium modification over the vacuum spectrum is given by @xmath71 which is a function of two variables @xmath46 and @xmath69 since @xmath13 has been integrated out . employing a linear taylor expansion of @xmath72 around @xmath46 mustafa - thoma",
    "( 3 ) of ref . 1 ]",
    "arrived at the estimate @xmath73    we wish to point out that the above estimate is unreliable because the experimentally parametrized light hadron production cross - section at rhic energy namely  @xcite @xmath74 is a rapidly varying function of @xmath75 .",
    "it is much safer to compute the integral ( c12 ) by simpson quadrature which reveals that the ratio @xmath76 , for @xmath77 , is close to 1 at @xmath78 but becomes about @xmath79 at @xmath80 .",
    "( see fig . 1 for a more detailed view ) .",
    "_ the sixth lacuna of  @xcite is that their taylor expansion result ( c13 ) grossly overestimates the convolution integral for large track lengths .",
    "_     plotted as a function of parton energy e at various track lengths @xmath69 .",
    "the curve corresponding to @xmath81 fm has not been shown because @xmath82 shoots to @xmath79 for @xmath83 gev.,title=\"fig : \" ]    an important observation must be made at this juncture . the above discussion along with fig .",
    "1 is the easiest way to check the inadequacy of the mt approximation ( c13 ) based on @xmath84 , without getting bogged - down with experimental complications . if , however , actual rhic data on jet quenching are to be fitted then due consideration must be given to the temperature @xmath85 gev , plasma life time @xmath86 fm / c , cylindrical geometry of bjorken expansion , production configuration @xmath87 of the leading parton in the transverse plane , jet track lengths @xmath88 fm etc . even then , the detailed convolution integral should be computed using simpson s quadrature at every stage rather than the @xmath84 approximation .",
    "in view of the recent rhic experiments the subject of jet quenching has become a very important research area because one must know the precise energy loss suffered by the leading parton due to the collisional encounters and radiative bremsstrahlung . for calculating the collisional energy loss one should start from a fp equation consistent with special relativity and work out all properties of the distribution function @xmath34 in conceptually valid manner . in this context refs .",
    "@xcite give excellent physical picture of the mechanisms but , unfortunately , most of their algebraic equations as well as numerical graphs seem to be unreliable .",
    "we will address these issues in detail in a subsequent paper .",
