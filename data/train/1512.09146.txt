    "collective excitations of the atomic nuclei reflects various properties of the nuclear structure and the underlying interaction between nucleons .",
    "their macroscopic or microscopic description has been a major subject in the nuclear theory  @xcite .",
    "recently , self - consistent mean - field models , based on the nuclear density functional theory ( dft ) , have been intensively applied to the collective excitations in heavy open - shell nuclei , where _ ab initio _ models are still not computationally feasible .",
    "the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) is a noticeable phenomenon generated by the electric dipole excitation .",
    "it is basically understood as a collective oscillation of all the neutrons against all the protons , occupying a major part of the nuclear giant resonances @xcite .",
    "the gdr plays an essential role in the nuclear photoabsorption reaction , determining the centroid energy and width of the cross section .",
    "nuclear photo - absorption reaction impacts also on the dynamics of various astrophysical scenarios  @xcite .",
    "therefore , gdr can provide a good testing ground for dft - based theories to describe the nuclear collectivity , as well as the relevant physical properties of finite and infinite nuclear systems .",
    "for example , the centroid energy of gdr , which is well approximated as @xmath0 mev for spherical nuclei , can be connected to the symmetry energy in the infinite nuclear matter , which is an important pseudo - observable used to determine the parameters of the nuclear energy density functional ( edf )  @xcite .",
    "the wide spread of the gdr in neutron - rich nuclei @xcite has been understood to originate from the ground state deformation , which has been well reproduced with the modern nuclear edfs @xcite .",
    "also , the pairing part of the nuclear edf has been expected to play a significant role in the low - lying dipole excitations of exotic nuclei @xcite .",
    "a commonly used dft - based approach to address collective nuclear excitations is done in the framework of linear response theory , with random - phase approximation ( rpa ) . by taking the pairing correlations into account ,",
    "the rpa is extended to the quasiparticle random - phase approximation ( qrpa ) , which has been conventionally treated in the matrix formulation @xcite .",
    "a fully self - consistent calculation within the matrix qrpa could be , however , numerically demanding due to the large size of qrpa matrices .",
    "especially , in the case where the spherical symmetry is broken , one often needs to employ an additional truncation on the two - quasiparticle model space in order to reduce the numerical cost @xcite .",
    "another approach to reduce the computational cost of the qrpa is the separable approximation for the residual interaction @xcite .",
    "such a truncation or approximation , however , may invoke the spurious excitations due to the broken self - consistency between the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) ground state and the qrpa solution .",
    "the finite - amplitude method ( fam ) provides an alternative way to solve the qrpa problem with a significantly reduced computational cost . with this method ,",
    "the qrpa linear response problem is solved iteratively , by circumventing actual calculation and diagonalization of the qrpa matrix .",
    "fam was originally developed for a computation of the rpa strength function , and soon after it was expanded to cover the qrpa problem within spherical symmetry @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , fam - qrpa was implemented into the axially symmetric skyrme - hfb solver , based on the harmonic oscillator basis . up to the date",
    ", fam has been implemented also to the axially symmetric coordinate - space hfb solver  @xcite and to the relativistic mean - field framework  @xcite .",
    "various applications of the fam include descriptions of giant and pygmy dipole excitations @xcite , efficient computation of the qrpa matrix elements @xcite , and evaluation of beta - decay rates , including the proton - neutron pairing correlations  @xcite .",
    "the contour integration technique of fam - qrpa was developed to describe individual qrpa modes @xcite and for a fast calculation of the energy - weighted sum rules @xcite .",
    "in addition to fam , the iterative arnoldi method presents an alternative method to solve the qrpa problem iteratively  @xcite .",
    "it was also applied to the multipole excitations with pairing correlations @xcite .",
    "this article is devoted to fam - qrpa methodology applied to the gdr of the heavy rare - earth nuclei , within the skyrme edf framework . due to the open - shell nature of these nuclei",
    ", pairing and deformation properties must be taken into account in systematic study .",
    "we do not assume any truncation of the two - quasiparticle model space in the qrpa , nor the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) approximation for the pairing , but keep a full self - consistency between the hfb and qrpa . to check the validity of the fam - qrpa ,",
    "the results are compared with several sets of experimental data .",
    "we also investigate the impact of the thomas - reiche - kuhn ( trk ) sum rule enhancement factor on the isovector dipole excitation .",
    "because the trk sum rule is independent on theoretical models and only the enhancement factor ( or equivalently , the isovector effective mass ) includes the information on the nuclear structure , the energy - weighted sum rule of gdr is an important quantity which reflects the properties of edfs @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of gdr to the isovector effective mass is also discussed .",
    "we introduce the basic formalism of the skyrme edf and fam - qrpa in the next section .",
    "the results are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : res ] . finally , we summarize this article in sec .  [",
    "sec : sum ] .",
    "as a starting point , our hfb calculations were done in the skyrme edf framework . in order to write the skyrme energy density ,",
    "it is convenient to introduce the isoscalar and isovector local densities _ 0()=_n()+_p ( ) ,  _ 1()=_n()-_p ( ) , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the neutron and proton densities . with these densities , the skyrme energy density for the particle - hole ( ph ) channel reads as ^skyrme & = & _ t=0,1 , + ^even_t & = & c^_t[_0]^2_t + c^_t_t _ t + c^_t_t _ t + & & + c^j_t_t @xmath3_t + c^jj_t@xmath3 ^ 2_t , + ^odd  _ t & = & c^ss_t[_0]@xmath4 ^ 2_t + c^s s_t@xmath4_t @xmath4_t + c^st_t@xmath4_t @xmath5_t + & & + c^s j_t@xmath4_t ( @xmath6_t ) + c^jj_t@xmath6 ^ 2_t , where @xmath7 indicates the isoscalar ( isovector ) components .",
    "the time - even part @xmath8 , is a functional of the local density @xmath9 , kinetic density @xmath10 , and spin - orbit density @xmath11 , whereas the time - odd part @xmath12 is expressed with the spin density @xmath13 , current density @xmath14 , and kinetic - spin density @xmath15 .",
    "the detailed formulation of these quantities can be found in , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "the coupling coefficients , @xmath16 , etc .",
    ", are uniquely related to the well - known @xmath17 parameterization of the skyrme force @xcite .",
    "also , some of coupling constants can be connected to the properties of the symmetric or asymmetric nuclear matter , which are useful pseudo - observables for the optimization purposes of the skyrme edf parameters .",
    "these pseudo - observables can be treated as alternative edf input parameters instead of coupling constants  @xcite .    in hfb calculation for the ground state of even - even nuclei ,",
    "a time - reversal symmetry is usually assumed , and hence , the time - odd part of the functional does not make contribution to the hfb solution . on the other side , when the time - reversal symmetry becomes broken , like in the case of qrpa ,",
    "the time - odd part becomes active .",
    "if we start from the original skyrme force , the consequent time - odd part of the edf has a unique correspondence to the time - even part . in other words ,",
    "when we fix the coupling coefficients in the time - even part , those in the time - odd part should be automatically determined . in the edf framework , however , a further generalization can be considered : one may treat the time - odd coefficients independently from the time - even ones . in this work ,",
    "time - odd part is determined as in the case of skyrme force . for coulomb energy density ,",
    "the direct term is treated in a usual manner and for the exchange part we employ slater approximation .    for the particle - particle ( pp ) channel , which describes nuclear pairing correlations , we employ a functional of the density - dependent delta pairing ( dddp ) energy density .",
