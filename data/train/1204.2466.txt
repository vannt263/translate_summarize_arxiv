    "in recent years the order parameters of quantum chromodynamics at finite temperature and chemical potential ( @xmath1 ) have gained renewed attention .",
    "at least part of this comes from the need to know where and when phase transitions occur in quark matter experiments , such as the observations of quark - gluon plasma at rhic and lhc - alice .",
    "however , due to the confining nature of qcd , the usual perturbative approach breaks down at low energies , meaning that other methods need to be employed for quantative results in this regime .",
    "a widely succesful method is the lattice formulation of qcd @xcite proposed by wilson in 1974 in which the challenges lie in the evaluation of group integrals over @xmath2 .    aside from the significant challenges in the analytical evaluation of these integrals , numerical calculations also run into trouble in the form of the sign problem when",
    "the chemical potential is applied . as such it is instructive to work in the @xmath3 limit , which , due to the @xmath4 expansion of qcd , provides a reasonably accurate approximation to @xmath5 but allows for a simplification of some problems . here",
    "we will present analytically exact calculations within the effective theory of polyakov loops in the @xmath3 limit and determine an expression for the order parameter of qcd in the case of an applied real quark chemical potential .",

    "quarks are introduced by using wilson s method of heavy fermions by adding ( in the notation by creutz @xcite ) @xmath10 where the @xmath11 sum is over all nearest - neighbour pairs with one term for each ordering of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14 is a unit vector from @xmath12 to @xmath13 and @xmath15 is the flavour - dependent hopping parameter with @xmath16 being the number of spatial dimensions . at this point",
    "it is straightforward to integrate out the fermionic degrees of freedom and expand the fermion determinant in terms of @xmath17 @xmath18 } \\right ) }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sum is over all loops without backtracking .",
    "a chemical potential is added by multiplying the positively ( negatively ) oriented time - like products by @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) in likeness of a fourth component of the gauge field @xcite . at this point the effective theory of polyakov loops can be derived using the strong coupling expansion together with the option of gauge fixing any maximal tree of link variables @xmath21 @xcite or by using a kadanoff - inspired bond - moving procedure @xcite . to leading order in both @xmath22 and @xmath23",

    "here @xmath30 is the number of lattice sites in the temporal direction .",
    "the values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 get renormalized by taking into account the spatial link integrations . for notational simplicity",
    "we define @xmath33 from now on .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to derive the analytically exact expectation value , @xmath34 , of the polyakov loop in the @xmath3 limit , keeping the ratio @xmath35 fixed .",
    "the discussion below is largely analoguous to that of @xcite but with a few crucial exceptions in order to treat the case of an applied chemical potential . starting from the action ( [ eq : polyact ] ) and writing @xmath36[w^{\\dagger}(x+j)-{\\langle w^{\\dagger}(x+j ) \\rangle } ] + h.c \\right\\ } \\nonumber   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last term",
    "does not contribute in the @xmath3 limit due to factorization .",

    "in fact @xmath39 and @xmath40 due to the haar measure , meaning both expectations are real .",

    "amazingly enough this equation means that the integral , @xmath54 , only depends on the product of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , simplifying the problem of calculating the expectation values markedly .",
    "reexpressing the partition function : @xmath60 means that the expectation values can be expressed as @xmath61 for @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the case of @xmath65 and @xmath66 is trivially solved and yields @xmath67 .",
    "notice that from these expressions @xmath68 , which , by using the self - consistency relations , also leads to @xmath69 .",
    "using @xcite the integration can be performed : @xmath70 solving the self - consistency equations in the case of @xmath71 + @xmath72 is straightforward , but in the case of @xmath73 there is a small detail which requires mentioning . rewriting the integration result ( [ eq : ninfint ] ) @xmath74 we can use that for @xmath75 then @xmath76 to simplify the expression . to make this step cover",
    "the case of @xmath77 requires setting @xmath78 simultaneously , such that @xmath79 which is the solution when @xmath80 from the beginning .",

    "the associated free energy is found to be @xmath88 with a third order phase - transition point at @xmath83 in which @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the transition line is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : freeen ] . inserting the solutions the @xmath91 part of the free energy can be simplified and written as @xmath92 the free energy , like the partition function in [ eq : parttoprod ] , is independent of the chemical potential , since the factors of @xmath93 and @xmath94 cancel - a consequence of this is that the quark number density is zero @xmath95 this result is an artifact of @xmath86 and not @xmath9 - a claim which is supported in a recent mean field study @xcite further investigating the @xmath86 and @xmath9 difference .",
    "note that , surprisingly , this means that the @xmath3 limit of the @xmath86 and @xmath9 theories _ differ _ even though the difference between the two groups vanishes as @xmath96 .",
    "for recent numerical work for @xmath2 in the case of a real chemical potential , we refer the reader to @xcite where complex langevin techniques and the flux representation is used .",
    "work on a related model incorperating higher order contributions to the effective theory is found in @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "it is remarkable that the phase diagram of the @xmath97 theory @xcite looks qualitively similar to that of fig .",

    "we have found an analytically exact expression for the order parameter of qcd , @xmath34 , within the effective theory of polyakov loops with an applied chemical potential in the limit @xmath3 . furthermore the free energy has been calculated and displayed a third order phase transition at @xmath83 . the free energy , and hence also the point of the phase transition ,",
    "was found to be @xmath98 independent , in agreement with large-@xmath0 counting .",
