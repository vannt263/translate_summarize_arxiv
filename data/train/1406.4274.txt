    "recently , graphene plasmons ( gps ) have been focused much attention for their extremely large field enhancement and relatively long propagation length @xcite . for these unique optical properties ,",
    "graphene is believed as one of the best plasmon materials in the infrared and terahertz regimes . due to the large momentum mismatch between free light and graphene plasmons",
    ", graphene plasmons can not be excited by free light along translation invariant directions .",
    "therefore , structured graphene such as graphene ribbons @xcite , periodic ribbon arrays @xcite , graphene disks @xcite and graphene rings @xcite are put forward to break up translation invariance .",
    "meanwhile , some research groups have used a scattering - type scanning near - field optical microscope ( s - snom ) to generate and mapping graphene plasmons @xcite . however , the generation of highly wavelength controllable and long - lived gps with a relatively simple experimental method is still the bottleneck for applications of gps .",
    "it is a known fact that gps can be actively controlled by bias voltages or chemical doping @xcite .",
    "but the former method is usually relatively difficult and costed , and the latter method may lead to additional defect scattering in graphene .",
    "thus it is difficult to obtain high quality graphene . for long wavelengths @xmath0 ,",
    "the dispersion of graphene plasmons reduces to @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the energy of gps without plasmon - phonon coupling , @xmath3 is the effective average over the dielectric constants of the substrate and air , @xmath41/137 is the fine structure constant , and @xmath5 is the fermi energy linked to the carrier density of graphene .",
    "this equation means that the properties of substrates can be an equally important factor as the fermi energy of graphene to affect the gps , especially when the coupling between gps and surface phonons of the substrate is existing @xcite .",
    "these plasmon - phonon coupled modes ( ppcms ) can reduce intrinsic damping of gps and process longer lifetime than gps , which have been verified experimentally @xcite .",
    "however , the energy of ppcms usually locates near the surface phonon energy of substrates , which is determined by the phonon of substrates . as a result",
    ", these ppcms can hardly be controlled . in this paper , we propose using a semiconductor material as the substrate of graphene . through adjusting the coupling between free electron oscillations and phonons of the substrate , one can change the energy and lifetime of the surface phonon , thus realize the actively control of the properties of ppcms . and",
    "the carrier concentration of semiconductor substrates can be easily modified by application of electrical fields or light , therefor these ppcms can also be controlled by applying external visible or near - infrared optical excitations or electrical fields , which is much simpler than changing the intrinsic property of graphene .",
    "our proposed scheme is indicated in fig .",
    "a graphene sheet is placed on a doped semiconductor substrate . gallium arsenide ( gaas ) , which is a typical semiconductor material ,",
    "is taken for an example .",
    "the carrier concentration of gaas can be tuned by external electrical fields or optical excitations .",
    "the phonons and free electrons included dielectric function of polar semiconductor materials is described as follows @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 denotes the frequency of transverse optical phonons , @xmath8 is the damping rate related to phonons , @xmath9 denotes the plasma energy of free electrons , @xmath10 is the damping rate related to the electron scattering in gaas . @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the static and high frequency dielectric constants , respectively . for gaas , the parameters @xcite are @xmath13 @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 @xmath19/vs .",

    "the dispersion relation of graphene between two dielectric materials can be obtained from the pole of @xmath29-polarized fresnel reflection coefficients @xcite : @xmath30 in order to get the lifetime of ppcms , the coupling mechanism between gaphene and gaas can be considered as follows . the coupling strength between graphene plasmons and surface polar phonons",

    "[ fig2](a ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the intrinsic carrier concentration of gaas is @xmath61 @xmath58 .",
    "one can find that the dispersion of graphene plasmons splits into two branches due to plasmon - phonon coupling , and the two branches are labelled as a and b , respectively .",
    "first of all , for both branches a and b , the plasmon energy increases as the carrier concentration increases .",
    "secondly , there is a low energy cutoff frequency which is not existing in a normal polar material * ? ? ?",
    "* for the branch b. also the energy range of the branch b becomes narrower when the carrier concentration increases .",
    "because the up limit @xmath7 exists , the branch b only exists near @xmath7 , which leads to near - zero group velocity , this can be found applications in slow light propagation and optical storage . thirdly , the branch a becomes nearly linear rather than quadratic ( no coupling limit ) when the carrier concentration is over @xmath62 @xmath58 , which leads to group velocity dispersiveness gps modes .",

    "[ fig2](b ) shows the lifetime of carrier concentration dependent ppcms by using eq .",

    ", the free electron damping in gaas is not considered ( in coincide to the dispersion in fig . [ fig2](a ) ) and the surface - phonon damping @xmath63 is set as 1ps as reported in sio@xmath64 @xcite .",
    "we can find that the plasmon lifetime becomes longer when the carrier concentration becomes larger .",
    "to understand the dispersion and lifetime of ppcms , the coupled surface phonon of the substrate is introduced and described , which is calculated by @xmath65 with eq .",
    "( [ eqn2 ] ) .",
    "these results are shown in fig . [ fig3](a ) .",

    ", one can find that the cutoff frequency of branch a monotonously increases from the origin value @xmath67 and does not have up limit in our calculated carrier concentration range , while the cutoff frequency of branch b monotonously increases from 0 ( no cutoff frequency ) to @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , the energy of branch a surpasses the high energy @xmath66 , and the energy of branch b locates between the low energy @xmath66 and @xmath7 .",
    "thus , one can know that the behavior of carrier concentration dependent ppcms shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) results from the controlling of the surface phonon of substrate .",
    "( a).,width=264 ]    from the surface phonon strength definition @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the one - phonon excited state in the @xmath70th level , @xmath71 and @xmath72 is surface phonon creation operator .",

    "*    @xmath73    where @xmath74 is the normalized coupled surface phonon energy , and @xmath75 is normalized bulk plasmon of gaas .",
    "the value @xmath76 describes the weight of the two surface phonons , which contributes to the property of total surface phonons .",
    "the strength of surface phonons is calculated and shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) , we know that the phonon strength of branch a ( b ) decreases ( increases ) dramatically as the carrier concentration increases , similar to the behavior of phonon lifetime shown in fig . [ fig3](a ) .",

    "[ fig2](b).,width=264 ]    to further understand the lifetime of ppcms , in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , the lifetime does not include the contribution from the scattering of free electrons in gaas .",
    "more specifically , the lifetime of surface phonon is set to a constant value 1ps in our pervious calculations . however , from fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) we know that the lifetime of coupled surface phonon will decrease ( increase ) for branch a ( b ) with electron scattering .",
    "so the electron scattering effect must be considered in further calculations if one wants to compare the theoretical results with actual experiments . by substituting the @xmath46 into eq .",
    "( [ eqn5 ] ) , the total lifetime of gps is calculated and shown in fig .",

    "so finite discrete wavelengths and momentums are taken to realize gps excitation and propagation .",
    "first , we analyze the dispersion of ppcms with a given wavelength . without loss of generality",
    ", two energies from branch a ( @xmath81 ev ) and branch b ( @xmath77 ev ) are chosen .",
    "the momentum and lifetime of the carrier concentration dependent ppcms are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) .",
    "one can find that the momenta of branches a and b ( the solid lines ) decrease to zero as the concentration increases .",
    "the result indicates that for a given monochromatic wave , we can always find a proper concentration to match the momentum out of the light cone .",
    "this effect opens a door for that all kinds of confined modes or evanescent waves can be coupled to ppcms .",
    "the corresponding lifetime of these branches is indicated by the dashed lines . and",
    "the lifetime increases dramatically as the momentum decreasing .",
    "this is due to the effect of phonon coupling and low mode confinement .",
    "the critical point showed in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) is the lifetime of zero concentration position . because of the absence of gaas electron scattering damping path , it is longer than low concentration condition with electronic damping . when the concentration is larger than @xmath82 @xmath58 , the lifetime of ppcms can be longer than zero concentration lifetime for @xmath81 ev ( @xmath83 ps ) . for the energy @xmath77 ev",
    "the lifetime is always larger than zero concentration lifetime ( @xmath84 ps ) in our calculation carrier concentration range . on the other hand , for a given momentum @xmath85 5 @xmath86 , the ppcms energy and lifetime",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) . from the figure , we know that the branches a and b show similar behavior in the case with @xmath87 ( fig . [ fig3 ] ( a ) ) . if a wide spectrum pulse is given , one can tune the output frequency of ppcms by changing the carrier concentration in a fixed experimental scheme .        finally , coupled surface phonon energy change with carrier concentration for several semiconductor materials is inverstigated .",
    "the change range is determined mainly by the effective carrier mass of semiconductor .",
    "for inas , surface phonon energy can reach @xmath23 ev for concentration near @xmath88 @xmath58 , which means that all the energy below intrinsic graphene phonon can lead to ppcms .",
    "in summary , in this paper we investigated analytically the effect of substrate carrier concentration on the properties of ppcms . by using the semiconducor substratrate gaas , we found the coupled modes can be effectively controlled by changing the carrier density of the substrate .",
    "specifically , the dispersion and lifetime of ppcms can be controlled by the carrier density of gaas . in",
