    "constraining primordial non - gaussianity offers a powerful test of the generation mechanism of cosmological perturbations in the early universe . while standard single - field models of slow - roll inflation lead to small departures from gaussianity , non - standard scenarios allow for a larger level of non - gaussianity ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the standard observables to constrain non - gaussianity are the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and the large scale structure ( lss ) of the universe .",
    "a powerful technique is based on the abundance @xcite and clustering @xcite of rare events , such as dark matter density peaks , as they trace the tail of the underlying matter distribution .",
    "theoretical predictions on various observational aspects of non - gaussianity have been extensively tested against n - body simulations , leading to different and sometimes conflicting results @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite showed that primordial non - gaussianity affects the clustering of dark matter halos inducing a scale - dependent bias on large scales .",
    "not only this effect has been already exploited to place stringent constraints on non - gaussianity @xcite , but also it is particularly promising for constraining non - gaussianity from future surveys , which will provide a large sample of galaxy clusters over a volume comparable to the horizon size ( e.g. , des , panstarrs , boss , lsst , adept , euclid ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that even for small primordial non - gaussianities , the evolution of perturbations on super - hubble scales yields extra contributions .",
    "the amplitude of these contributions is comparable to the forecasted errors of some planned surveys , opening up the possibility of measuring them .    in light of this",
    ", it is important to use n - body experiments to test the validity of theoretical predictions for halo - bias in non - gaussian framework .",
    "indeed , all proposed analytic biasing expressions have been derived in the extended press - schechter framework which assumes spherical collapse dynamics , sharp k - space filtering and gaussian initial conditions .",
    "the validity of the extrapolation of the extended press - schechter approach to the non - gaussian case can be tested independently by considering also the halo mass function .",
    "it is thus also important to test and calibrate on n - body simulations the predictions of the non - gaussian halo mass function @xcite and of the non - gaussian halo bias simultaneously .",
    "this is what we set out to do here .    in this paper",
    "we start by reviewing the analytic predictions for the gaussian and non - gaussian halo abundance and clustering (  2 ) . in  3 we describe the numerical simulations with gaussian and non - gaussian initial conditions . in ",

    ", one considers the density contrast field evaluated at some early time , far before any scale of interest has approached the nonlinear regime , but extrapolated to the present day using linear perturbation theory .",
    "then one considers the height of the critical density threshold as a function of time . in that way",
    ", the collapse of a halo at redshift @xmath12 corresponds to the @xmath9 density fluctuation crossing a barrier of height @xmath13 , where @xmath14 ( this is an equality only in an einstein de sitter universe ) ; we use @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "we should recall here that , even in linear theory , the normalized skewness of the density field , @xmath17 , depends on redshift @xmath18 , however in the press - schechter framework one should use the linear @xmath19 , in what follows @xmath20 .",
    "note also that in general the skewness can be written as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denotes the skewness in units of @xmath5 , care must be exercised in the interpretation of @xmath5 : if @xmath22 is that of the density field linearly extrapolated at @xmath23 , @xmath0 must be the lss one and _ not _ the cmb one .",
    "generalization of the mass function to non - gaussian initial conditions within the press - shechter formalism has been presented in @xcite .",

    "the major limitations in both derivations are the assumption of spherical collapse and the sharp @xmath35-space filtering .",
    "in addition , the excursion set improvement on the interpretation of the original press - shechter swindle , suggests that this derivation relies on the random - phase hypothesis @xcite , which is clearly not satisfied for non - gaussian initial conditions even for sharp @xmath35-space filtering .",
    "@xcite and @xcite addressed this issue by using the analytical approach to compute the fractional non - gaussian _ correction _ to the gaussian mass function @xmath36 , and used the @xcite mass function to model the gaussian mass function .",
    "this approach is potentially promising , but needs to be calibrated on numerical experiments .",
    "in particular , one may argue that the same correction that in the gaussian case modifies the collapse threshold and thus the form of the mass function from @xcite to @xcite and @xcite , may apply to the non - gaussian correction . in the gaussian case this is usually referred to as the correction due to ellipsoidal collapse @xcite . while this interpretation has recently been disputed ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , we will maintain the same nomenclature here . for rare events , high peaks ( @xmath37 ) and small @xmath5 ,",
