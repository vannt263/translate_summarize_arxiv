    "as an important tool in the study of phase transitions monte carlo simulations passed through significant advances in the last decades and number of new algorithms and improvements were proposed in various directions , such as cluster algorithms by swendsen and wang @xcite or wolff @xcite , multicanonical algorithm @xcite , wang - landau algorithm @xcite . an interesting direction undertaken by machta et al .",
    "@xcite was to construct an algorithm which would , in a self organized way , drive the system to critical temperature without prior knowledge of it .",
    "it was applied to various classical models from discrete to continuous ones including some more complicated effects such as frustration @xcite , quasi periodic ordering @xcite , or tricritical points @xcite .",
    "their method , based on the invasion percolation @xcite and the cluster algorithm , appeared to converge much faster than in the swendsen - wang ( sw ) algorithm , with a dynamical exponent @xmath0 close to zero . in the same time it opened a number of issues @xcite,@xcite related to the fact that the underlying nonequilibrium procedure does not generate an equilibrium ensemble and consequently is not able to reproduce correct critical exponents when a finite size scaling is applied .",
    "there were also some other attempts to design a cluster algorithm that would selfregulate to criticality @xcite .",
    "recently we proposed a modification of the ic algorithm @xcite aimed to reestablish the equilibrium in the self - regulating procedure of the ic algorithm .",
    "the principal idea is to impose a simple constraint on the temperature uncertainty characteristic to the ic algorithm , reducing it to the limits compatible with the equilibrium distribution . as shown in our preliminary work @xcite , when this single constraint is applied to the ic algorithm ,",
    "the correct scaling properties of thermodynamic observables are recovered , while the algorithm still retains the property of self driving to criticality .",
    "the aim of the present paper is twofold .",
    "first , it offers a more intensive and comprehensive numerical calculations , including the leading convergence exponent , in order to examine the precision of the results for critical exponents and temperature that the eic algorithm can provide .",
    "second is to extend the study to the dynamical properties of the algorithm , in particular to the autocorrelation functions , which indicate deviations from the equilibrium distribution providing the criteria for the choice of auxiliary parameters of the method , which would not produce systematic errors .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ meth ] we introduce the model and notations and describe in detail the principles of eic algorithm . in sect .",
    "[ crit ] is presented the analysis of critical exponents and temperature including the leading correction to scaling .",
    "we also add a brief comment on the application of this algorithm to the first - order phase transition . in sect .",
    "[ dyn ] we study the dynamical properties of eic algorithm through the autocorrelations of energy and order parameter with a special emphasis on the impact of choice of the two auxiliary parameters . sect .",
    "[ discs ] contains the conclusion .",
    "we consider the potts model @xcite defined by the hamiltonian @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the @xmath3-state potts variable at the lattice site @xmath4 and the summation runs over the nearest neighbors . as shown by fortuin and kasteleyn ( fk ) @xcite , the partition function of the model ( [ dil_potts ] ) can be written as @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the boltzmann factor . by expanding the binomial product into sum over graphs and integrating over the spin degrees of freedom it reduces to the random - cluster ( rc ) model @xmath8 which can be understood as a generalized bond percolation , where @xmath9 is the bond probability .",
    "the summation in eq .",
    "( [ rand_cluster ] ) is taken over the set @xmath10 of all the graphs on the lattice , each graph @xmath11 representing one possible bond configuration .",
    "@xmath12 is the number of the lattice edges , @xmath13 denotes the number of bonds , and @xmath14 is the number of connected components ( fk clusters ) in the graph @xmath11 .",
    "fk expansion of the potts model partition function is also used as a basis for construction of cluster algorithms for numerical simulations @xcite , @xcite . to this purpose the r.h.s . of the eq .",
    "( [ z - potts ] ) can be written in alternative way by introducing new degrees of freedom @xmath15 , representing the absence or presence of bonds in the expansion of the binary product in eq .",
    "( [ z - potts ] ) . in such a way",
    "the boltzmann weight in ( [ z - potts ] ) is decomposed into two joint distributions : over spin ( @xmath16 ) or bond ( @xmath17 ) configurations @xmath18 as it may be seen from eqs ( [ z - potts ] ) and ( [ dist - sw ] ) , for a given bond configuration , only the spin configurations where the spins belonging to the same cluster are in the same state give a nonzero contribution to the partition function , while entire clusters may be flipped without an energy cost .",
    "on the other hand , for a given spin configuration ( @xmath16 ) the boltzmann weight reduces to a binomial distribution of bond occupancy @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the total number of `` satisfied '' edges ( surrounded by spins in the same state ) . the standard cluster algorithms such as sw @xcite consist in alternate updates of bonds and spins . in the first part of the mc step , taken a given spin configuration @xmath16 , the fk clusters are formed by putting bonds , with probability @xmath9 , between neighbors in the same state . in the second part",
    "each cluster is flipped at random producing a new configuration of spins .",
    "the bonds are then erased and one proceeds to the next mc step .",
    "in such a way the equilibrium ensemble is generated .",
    "the ic algorithm @xcite consists of the same two steps , but the bond update is altered in order to accomplish the self driving to criticality . given the configuration of spins , the bonds are added with the probability 1 , but only until the percolation is achieved .",
    "this is interpreted as a signature of a finite - size critical point .",
    "as soon as the percolation is reached the fk clusters are randomized .",
    "the fraction of `` satisfied '' edges that has been populated @xmath21 is recorded after each mc step .",
    "@xmath22 denotes the number of added bonds and @xmath23 the number of neighboring pairs in a same state for a given spin configuration @xmath16 .",
    "the average over simulations @xmath24 is identified with the quantity @xmath9 defined in ( [ p ] ) , yielding a critical temperature estimate .",
    "it is easy to understand why such a procedure is self - driving to criticality .",
    "namely if the given configuration of spins is typical for a temperature much higher than @xmath25 ( with random and poorly correlated spins ) almost all the edges with satisfied neighbors will need to be populated before the percolation has been achieved .",
    "the @xmath20 in the next iteration can only be larger - the system will be driven towards configurations with lower energies , corresponding to lower temperatures .",
    "on the other hand , when the configuration is typical of lower temperatures , with @xmath20 considerably larger than the one in criticality , small amount of added bonds will suffice to achieve percolation , so that , after randomization of clusters @xmath20 will be diminished driving the system to higher temperature configurations . in the same time",
    "one can notice here a back - draw of this self driving procedure . in both cases ,",
    "the described configurations that have been retained for statistics result from the tails of a binomial distribution ( [ fixed - s ] ) .",
    "problem is that such configurations are typical during entire ic simulation .",
    "namely , in spite of the fact that the system is driven to criticality , the described oscillations remain significant throughout the simulations , so that it generates distribution of @xmath26 that is much wider than it would result from the binomial distribution of ( [ fixed - s ] ) .",
    "consequently , the resulting ensemble is not a canonical one and not in equilibrium , as observed already in @xcite .",
    "our eic algorithm approach follows the same ic procedure but restrains the excessive fluctuations in @xmath26 in order to regain the equilibrium fluctuations .",
    "the main idea is to constrain the width of distribution of @xmath26 obtained from the simulations by the relation ( [ p_gamma ] ) to the width which is compatible with the distribution of @xmath27 in ( [ fixed - s ] ) and which has the same scaling in @xmath28 .",
    "the width of the binomial distribution in eq .",
    "( [ fixed - s ] ) gives @xmath29 .",
    "since @xmath20 corresponds to the energy of a given configuration and is @xmath30 , we impose the constraint on @xmath26 , which allows it to vary only within limited range of the width @xmath31 .    to include this constraint into algorithm , we modified the stopping rule by introducing two auxiliary parameters to the ic algorithm , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "let us review this procedure briefly and discuss the role of these free parameters .",
    "the mc iterations are grouped in intervals of @xmath33 mc steps . in every interval @xmath4 of @xmath33",
    "steps the bonds are placed on the lattice between satisfied neighbors with the intention to construct a percolating cluster .",
    "however , the system is not left to percolate with just any value of @xmath26 as in the ic algorithm .",
    "any accepted configuration is required to lie inside the interval : @xmath34 , where @xmath35 denotes the average of @xmath26 over the i - th block of @xmath33 steps . here",
    "@xmath36 is the free parameter set to be : @xmath37 and @xmath32 is a constant whose choice will be discussed later . if the system percolates before the lower bound of @xmath26 is reached , the bonds are still added until the lower bound is attained .",
    "if the upper bound of @xmath26 is reached before the percolation is attained , the process is stopped without requiring the system to percolate .",
    "after every block of @xmath33 mc steps , the new average , @xmath38 , is calculated to be used as a reference value in the next @xmath33 steps .",
    "obviously , in this way the information on the value of @xmath39 in the preceding @xmath33 mc steps is propagated to the consecutive interval @xmath4 and will have an effect on the autocorrelation functions ( to be discussed in the sect .",
    "[ dyn ] ) .",
    "the starting value @xmath40 can be obtained by the unconstrained ic algorithm .",
    "one can also define a faster equilibration of the ic algorithm by gradually reducing the value of parameter @xmath32 in ( [ defv ] ) during some initial set of intervals of @xmath33 steps .",
    "these first few blocks of @xmath33 steps are discarded from statistics and the configurations are recorded after the steady state was reached .",
    "distribution of @xmath26 resulting from the above procedure has the required width proportional to @xmath41 under the assumption that @xmath33 is large enough so that the fluctuations of @xmath26 within the interval are dominant over the fluctuations of @xmath38 between the intervals . in this case",
    "the fluctuations of the mean value @xmath38 reduce to the actual temperature fluctuations , producing the width of order @xmath42 if the heat capacity exponent @xmath43 , or of order @xmath44 if @xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath33 would be small enough for the fluctuations of @xmath38 between the intervals to take over , a crossover to the ic regime would be seen .",
    "later we will demonstrate that there exists a clear indication when this occurs .",
    "for @xmath46 potts in 2d rescaled with the exact exponent @xmath47 . in the inset",
    "are shown ln - ln plots of @xmath48 vs. @xmath28 .",
    "the statistic is @xmath49 mcs for both eic and ic cases , and the parameters of the eic algorithm were chosen to be @xmath50 and @xmath51 . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we give an illustration that the canonical form of energy distribution is recovered within the eic algoritm . as noted by machta etal .",
    "@xcite , @xmath48 for 2d ising obtained by the ic algorithm scales approximately linearly with the system size @xmath28 , while it should scale as @xmath52 if the ensemble was canonical . to examine the same point within the eic algorithm",
    ", we present in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] an overlap fit of the energy distributions resulting from eic algorithm and compare it with the distributions obtained by ic algorithm with equal statistics , for several lattice sizes in the case of @xmath46 potts in 2d .",
    "the distributions are rescaled with the exact value of the exponent describing the width of the energy distribution in the equilibrium ensemble , @xmath53 .",
    "it is immediately seen that the results for different @xmath28 , obtained by eic , collapse very well , while the ones obtained by ic do not . to quantify that fact ,",
    "we show in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the ln - ln plots of @xmath54 vs. @xmath28 , the slopes of which in the canonical ensemble represent the exponent @xmath55 ( exactly equal to @xmath56 in this case ) . for the lattice sizes considered we obtain @xmath57 and @xmath58 for eic and ic cases respectively ( in terms of the width scaling @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) .",
    "this indicates that the ensemble sampled by the eic algorithm is indeed canonical , contrary to the one produced by the standard ic algorithm , which appears to be much wider and scales with different exponent , characterizing the algorithm itself @xcite .",
    "as it shall be seen in the next section , the eic algorithm can be used to obtain very accurate values for critical exponents , not only the magnetic one related to criticality , but also the thermal critical exponent related to the approach to criticality and implying the validity of fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "derivation of critical exponents and temperature by eic algorithm was already illustrated by applying it to several cases of the potts model in our preliminary study . in present work",
    ", we selected only two cases both exhibiting 2nd order phase transition , one in two and one in three dimensions : case @xmath46 in 2d and ising case ( @xmath61 ) in 3d .",
    "we conducted extensive numerical simulations increased by an order of magnitude with respect to the preliminary study @xcite .",
    "this allowed us to calculate the leading power - law corrections as well and analyze the precision of the results with particular attention to possible systematic errors due to the choice of the auxiliary parameters .",
    "unlike our previous study , we avoided to use any data exactly known in advance and applied consistently multi parameter fits , which give critical temperature and critical exponents simultaneously whenever needed .",
    "the simulations were performed on lattices with periodic boundary conditions and sizes up to @xmath62 and @xmath63 in the 3d and 2d case respectively .",
    "the statistics varied from @xmath64 iterations for smaller to @xmath65 iterations for the largest lattice sizes in the 3d case and from @xmath66 to @xmath67 in the 2d case .",
    "the auxiliary parameters were set to @xmath68 and @xmath50 in both cases .",
    "the percolation was established by the topological rule , i.e. by the condition that the infinite cluster wraps around the lattice .",
    "the time necessary to reach the equilibrium state never exceeded the first 3000 mc steps with the above choice of auxiliary parameters @xmath33 and @xmath36 .",
    "the running time per mc step was approximately the same as for the original ic algorithm . for illustration ,",
    "a run of @xmath69 mc steps for the 2d ising model on @xmath70 lattice requires approximately 500s on the amd opteron 240 processor ( 1.4ghz ) .",
    "the magnetic critical exponent was evaluated independently from three different quantities calculated at criticality , the average mass of the largest cluster , the order parameter and the susceptibility .",
    "the average mass of the largest cluster @xmath72 is defined as the number of spins in the largest cluster averaged over all the configurations .",
    "its scaling yields the critical exponent @xmath71 directly @xmath73     versus the system size . ]    a four - parameter fit of our finite - size results ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) to the form ( [ smax ] ) produced rather accurate estimate of the exponent @xmath71 and showed that the leading correction is of a power law form .",
    "results for the exponents are : @xmath74 with @xmath75 and @xmath76 with @xmath77 for 3d ising and 2d q=3 potts model respectively .",
    "the order parameter @xmath78 scales at @xmath25 according to @xmath79 where @xmath80 is related to @xmath71 by @xmath81 .",

    "the fluctuations of the magnetization in equilibrium are related to the susceptibility by the relation @xmath87,\\ ] ] which assumes the validity of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , not fulfilled for the standard ic algorithm .    .",
    "]    for a finite system , at the quasicritical point @xmath88 , the susceptibility exhibits maximum , which scales with a power - law @xmath89 and is related to the magnetic exponent by @xmath90 .",
    "the log - log fit of the results ( see fig [ fig3 ] ) gives @xmath91 and @xmath92 for 3d ising and q=3 case in 2d respectively .",
    "we find the values of @xmath93 less accurate than the estimates for @xmath71 or @xmath80 .",
    "the reason may be attributed to the fact that , for a finite system , the critical point identified by the percolation through a specific choice of the stopping rule , should not necessarily coincide with the quasi - critical temperature defined by the maximum of the susceptibility .",
    "another quantity of interest , related to the magnetization is the binder fourth order cumulant @xcite , defined as @xmath94 one of its main benefits within numerical calculations is to provide a good estimation of the critical temperature , which in the present case , where the algorithm drives itself to the critical point is not the main issue . at criticality",
    "it may be related to the one of the universal amplitude ratios , and we found interesting to examine this quantity and its size convergence within the present algorithm .",
    "it is important to notice , that in the present approach , @xmath95 is calculated at the finite size critical point defined by the topological rule , hence @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is some non universal constant factor .",
    "the @xmath28 dependence of binder cumulant at this finite size critical point is @xmath98 consequently , the constant term of the binder cumulant in the thermodynamic limit depends on the way of approaching to the critical point .",
    "other authors @xcite considered instead the universal value @xmath99 . in fig [ fig4 ]     versus @xmath100 . ]",

    "the respective convergence exponent @xmath105 is determined to be @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "a value @xmath108 which is similar to the value obtained in the present work for 3d ising case can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite which was obtained by the extrapolation of th finite - size values @xmath109 taken at the point where @xmath110 attains its maximum .",
    "two quantities related to the thermal critical exponent @xmath112 were examined .",
    "the first one is @xmath113 , related to the quasicritical temperature , with the leading size dependence @xmath114 it is obtained from the average over @xmath26 defined in the eq .",
    "( [ p_gamma ] ) .     versus @xmath100 .",
    "dotted lines describe three parameter fits and crosses denote exact , or best known values . ]",
    "data for @xmath113 with a three - parameter fit are illustrated in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "the fit appears to be more suitable for finding the @xmath115 , giving the critical point with the precision up to the sixth digit , yielding @xmath116 and @xmath117 for 3d ising and q=3 case in 2d respectively .",
    "an estimate of the exponent @xmath111 by the same procedure appears , however , to be by an order of magnitude less precise than by the logarithmic derivative of @xmath78 .    to derive the critical exponent @xmath118 we consider the logarithmic derivative of magnetization ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) and use @xmath119 the equality in eq .",
    "( [ em ] ) implies that the equilibrium ensemble is well reproduced by our algorithm , which we expect to hold .",
    "indeed , the obtained values for the exponent @xmath118 are in excellent agreement with known exact , or best approximate results .",
    "the four - parameter fit to the form of the r.h.s . in ( [ em ] ) gave @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 , @xmath123 for 3d ising and 2d , q=3 case respectively .",

    "[ tab1 ]    [ tab2 ]    critical exponents , and their leading corrections calculated in preceding two sections are summarized in tables i and ii .",
    "it can be concluded that , with only a fraction of numerical effort needed for the sw algorithm , the critical behavior can be obtained very accurately and in excellent agreement with the best known or exact results .",
    "the location of the critical point can be obtained with rather high degree of accuracy as well .    for better reliability of our results we included in our analysis the corrections to scaling .",
    "we observe that they differ substantially from the expected scaling corrections due to the irrelevant scaling fields and nonlinearities of scaling fields near criticality and should be attributed to the method itself . the leading irrelevant exponent for 2d @xmath46",
    "is exactly known to be @xmath124 . for the 3d ising case",
    "it is estimated to be @xmath125 @xcite .",
    "our results show the scaling corrections that decay much faster than @xmath126 in most cases , giving the exponents @xmath127 close to -2 or -1 in the @xmath128 and @xmath129 case respectively .",
    "the exception is the convergence of the binder cumulant ( @xmath105 in tab .",
    "ii ) with the correction exponent that can be compared to the value of leading irrelevant scaling field @xmath126 found by other authors .",
    "the example for our study being the potts model gives and opportunity to examine the applicability of our algorithm to the first order phase transitions .",
    "we make thus a small digression here , to show , without going into any details , that the same procedure , when applied to a first order phase transition gives a clear indication on its character .",
    "we first remind that for studies of the first - order transitions by the ic algorithm the stopping rules based on the cluster mass are more appropriate @xcite and can be readily extended to eic . our intention here is to point out how the first - order phase transition manifests when the topological stopping rule is used . as the first - order transition is characterized by a finite hysteresis width , the construction of percolating clusters becomes possible for all the values of @xmath26 within the hysteresis and thus the values of @xmath26 sweep trough the entire width of the hysteresis .",
    "this results with the plateau in the distribution @xmath130 who s width is not proportional to @xmath131 but tends to some constant value corresponding to the hysteresis width in the thermodynamic limit ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .     of @xmath26 produced by eic algorithm for the 3d potts model in the case of strong ( @xmath132 ) and weak ( @xmath46 ) first - order phase transition . ]",
    "we illustrate this on the two examples of the first - order transition in the 3d potts model . for @xmath132 ,",
    "the first - order transition is very strong and the figure clearly reveals the width of the hysteresis . for @xmath46 which is characterized by a very weak first - order transition ,",
    "larger lattices are needed to see the hysteresis .",
    "however , already for modest sizes , an inspection of the figure [ fig7 ] suggests that the width of the distribution will not vanish with some power - law in @xmath28 , since its shape starts to qualitatively resemble the one for 3d , @xmath132 .",
    "the dynamics introduced by the eic algorithm was studied by considering the autocorrelation function defined for an arbitrary observable @xmath133 by @xmath134 the average is taken over the ensemble generated in the single run , after the thermalization , i.e. @xmath135 where @xmath136 , and @xmath137 denote time in discrete integer units corresponding to one mc step , and counting starts after equilibration . @xmath138 denotes the number of counted steps in the single run .",
    "( [ acorr_mc ] ) implies certain equilibrium properties of macroscopic variables such as the translational invariance in time and well defined temperature ( or @xmath9 ) .",
    "the self - regulating procedure of eic contains deviations from these properties , but as these occur within bounds which we expect to preserve the equilibrium ensemble we find justified to attempt a study of this process as the equilibrium one .",
    "we skip here the analysis of the nonequilibrium details of the process , which would require a different averaging procedure . instead",
    ", we apply the eq .",
    "( [ acorr_mc ] ) and just comment the differences found in comparison to the form of autocorrelation functions obtained in standard mc approaches .    in standard mc approaches",
    "one may usually distinguish three regimes of behavior of the autocorrelation functions @xcite .",
    "for short times they behave as a sum of exponential decays . for longer times",
    "they adopt a single exponential decay of the form @xmath139 with a correlation time @xmath140 , while for very large times the correlations vanish and the statistical errors take over .    in fig .",

    "are displayed the autocorrelations in the eic algorithm compared to those in the sw and ic algorithms on the example of the magnetic autocorrelation function in the case 2d @xmath46 .",
    "while the ic autocorrelations fall extremely fast , the eic correlations display similar decay as in the sw algorithm , with the difference that they acquire a negative sign at times of the order of @xmath33 .",
    "the slower decay of @xmath141 reflects the fact that ic dynamics has been slowed down by the requirement that the values of @xmath26 remain during @xmath33 mc steps in the narrow interval of @xmath142 around the average of @xmath39 .",
    "the fact that @xmath143 acquires negative values can be related to the abrupt switch of the mean value @xmath38 after every @xmath33 steps as a part of the self - regulating procedure .",
    "eic algorithm has a tendency to `` overshoot '' the critical temperature and find itself on the other side of the critical point in the following step .",
    "while @xmath144 represents the average of the magnetization taken over the entire run , the average of magnetization over each single @xmath33 block is different ( larger of smaller than @xmath144 ) and varies according to @xmath38 .",
    "this explains why in the expression for the correlation function , @xmath145 and @xmath146 can in average be of the opposite sign , when @xmath136 and @xmath147 belong to the neighboring blocks of @xmath33 steps and produce anticorrelations .",
    "the semi - log plot displayed in figure [ fig9 ] shows that the autocorrelation functions indeed match well the assumed exponential form .     of @xmath46 ,",
    "2d case for several lattice sizes in the exponential region .",
    "dashed lines represent best fits . ]",
    "this leads us to the question of the correlation time and the corresponding dynamic exponent @xmath0 , which should satisfy the scaling relation @xmath148 derivation of the correlation time is performed usually in two equivalent ways : by fitting the exponential decay ( exponential correlation time ) , or by taking the integral @xmath149 ( integrated correlation time ) .",
    "the calculation of the exponential correlation time applies to the present problem in a straightforward way , as already illustrated in fig ( [ fig9 ] ) .",
    "the correlation times derived from the slopes of such semi - log plots and the corresponding dynamic exponents are presented in table iii , denoted by @xmath150 and @xmath151 respectively .",
    "the calculation of an integrated correlation time is obviously not applicable in the present case since @xmath152 is not positive in the entire domain of integration . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we sketch the partial sums @xmath153 for the three algorithms . while in the sw case the sum @xmath154 rapidly saturates , for the eic algorithm these sums tend to vanish at infinity and exhibit maxima at the point where the @xmath152 turns negative .",
    "we thus consider instead the maxima of these partial sums . under certain approximation ,",
    "if the correlation time is much smaller than the time interval @xmath155 , they may be understood as characteristic times @xmath156 .",
    "namely , if @xmath157 , the exponential decay of autocorrelation functions dies out before the regime of anticorrelations sets in .",
    "the maxima of partial sums will then approximate well the ( integrated ) correlation time , while successfully leaving out of consideration the regime of anticorrelations .",
    "our analysis shows that these maxima ( see fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] )     of 3d ising for several lattice sizes . ]",
    "exhibit indeed a power - law scaling with an exponent very close to @xmath151 .",
    "however , if the condition @xmath157 is not fulfilled , such an approximation is not justified and we shall discuss the consequences later on . both @xmath158 and @xmath159 were calculated for the autocorrelations of energy and magnetization and are presented in log - log plots versus the system size @xmath28 in fig , [ fig11 ] ,        while the corresponding scaling exponents can be compared in table iii .",

    "we also observe a good matching between exponents @xmath151 and @xmath160 in the 3d case , while some discrepancy exists between these exponents in 2d . the reason for that can be related to the choice of the auxiliary parameters .     around @xmath50 ( indicated by the vertical line ) in the two cases considered and for various lattice sizes .",
    "]    while the correlation times are several times larger in the 2d case , all the calculations presented in table iii were performed with the same @xmath50 . as it may be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] , for the 3d ising case this choice is large enough to fulfill the condition @xmath157 , and allow the autocorrelations to become negligible before the effect of anticorrelations appears . in 2d case",
    "this condition is clearly not fulfilled , especially for larger lattice sizes , and the values @xmath161 and the corresponding exponent can not be related to the correlation time .",
    "it is interesting to discuss these results in context of the argument by li and sokal @xcite , which sets the lower bound on the dynamical exponent @xmath0 in cluster algorithms . relating the minimal autocorrelation times to the heat capacity of the system , they argue that the lower bound for the dynamical exponent is given by @xmath162 the results for @xmath163 summarized in tab .",
    "iii are compared to the most recent values of @xmath164 @xcite,@xcite , and to the exponent ratio @xmath165 . in both considered cases the dynamical exponent appears to be comparable , but lower than the value for the sw algorithm .",
    "we also observe that the values @xmath150 give results for the dynamical exponent conform to the li - sokal bound up to the statistical error . in the 2d case , where discrepancy between the exponents @xmath151 and @xmath160 was observed , the dynamic exponent is just about crossing the li - sokal limit , which can be understood as a sign that the system is close to leaving the equilibrium and taking the crossover to ic behavior .",
    "it has to be mentioned however , that as long as the width of temperature fluctuations is properly constrained this only seems to increase the noise in our results .",
    "no systematic errors were observed in the 2d results for @xmath50 , while the resulting ensemble retains the correct scaling , proper to the canonical ensemble as illustrated in figure [ fig1 ] .    in view of the above discussion we can drive some general conclusions about the choice of the auxiliary parameters @xmath33 and @xmath36 , and their impact on the results .",
    "it was briefly mentioned in the end of sect .",
    "[ meth ] that the number @xmath33 must be large enough to prevent the ic dynamics from taking over the behavior of @xmath26 fluctuations .",
    "this is the only restriction to the parameter @xmath33 . as discussed earlier in this section , this starts to happen when @xmath33 is comparable to the value of the autocorrelation time of the system in consideration . thus @xmath33 should be chosen to be at least more than two times larger than the autocorrelation time for any lattice size considered for a given system .",
    "when this is not fulfilled , there is a clear indication of the crossover to the ic dynamics in the behavior of the autocorrelation functions , as observed already in the 2d case with @xmath50 .",
    "when @xmath33 is reduced even further , the autocorrelation function changes the sign more than once , meaning that more than two values of @xmath38 are correlated , which clearly indicates the domination of ic dynamics over the eic dynamics ( fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] ) .     for different values of @xmath33 .",
    "]    indeed , in these cases one finds that @xmath166 where @xmath167 and the initial requirement for fluctuations of @xmath26 is not fulfilled .",
    "the effects of varying the parameter @xmath36 can also be observed in the behavior of autocorrelation functions .",
    "we shall illustrate this on two examples . in the first example @xmath36",
    "was augmented by keeping the the power - law decay of the form @xmath44 , but increasing the constant of proportionality @xmath168 beyond the value compatible with the width following from the binomial distribution of eq .",
    "[ fixed - s ] . in the second one",
    ", the parameter @xmath36 lies inside the regime imposed by the eic constraint , but decreases with size faster than @xmath44 .",
    "the examples are taken in the 2d , @xmath46 case for the lattice sizes from @xmath70 to @xmath169 , and using statistics of @xmath49 mc steps , while @xmath33 was increased to @xmath170 in order to avoid its contribution to nonequilibrium effects .",
    "for the case 2d , @xmath46 , the width of the distribution of @xmath26 corresponding to the binomial distribution in eq .",
    "( [ fixed - s ] ) would be @xmath171 .",
    "we compare the results for the three different values of @xmath36 : ( a ) @xmath172 ; ( b ) @xmath173 and ( c ) @xmath174 .",
    "the results for the dynamical exponents are shown in the tab .",
    "[ tab4 ]    let us first comment the reference case ( b ) corresponding to the value of @xmath36 used throughout this paper .",
    "when comparing the results with those in table iv , obtained with @xmath50 , one may see that by increasing @xmath33 the exponent @xmath151 approaches closer to the li - sokal limit , while the discrepancy between exponents @xmath151 and @xmath160 diminishes .",
    "this confirms the earlier discussion in this section and the expectation that an increasing of @xmath33 would indeed correct the deviation from the equilibrium behavior .    in the case",
    "( a ) the width @xmath36 has the same power - law decay , but the constant factor @xmath168 was taken larger than the value used in this paper and also larger than the one of the binomial distribution in eq .",
    "( [ fixed - s ] ) . in spite of the correct power - law dependence , the crossover to the ic regime for lattice sizes considered here is observed .",
    "in autocorrelation functions , the regime of single exponential decay shrinks drastically and consequently times @xmath150 could not be defined .",
    "we may still consider the quantity @xmath156 , since it still exhibits a power - law behavior , although it may not be interpreted as a correlation time .",
    "the corresponding exponent @xmath160 is much smaller than the li - sokal limit for the dynamical exponent of the equilibrium cluster algorithms .",
    "in contrast to this , in the example ( c ) with @xmath174 the exponential regime of the autocorrelation functions is longer then for @xmath173 and consequently allows a more accurate calculation of both @xmath150 and @xmath156 , giving the same dynamical exponent up to the error margins .",
    "it is interesting to notice that by reducing the width parameter @xmath36 , the dynamic exponent @xmath0 has increased .",
    "this provides a tool to vary the dynamical exponent continuously , by varying the exponent of power - law decay in @xmath36 .",
    "in this paper we presented more detailed study of recently proposed eic algorithm , designed to simultaneously drive the system to criticality without its prior knowledge and to provide the correct critical exponents .",
    "extensive numerical calculations performed on two typical examples of the potts model in two and three dimensions confirmed that the method efficiently produces results for both critical exponents and critical temperature , with considerable accuracy that attains up to 4 digits for critical exponents and six digits in the case of critical temperature .",
    "we conclude that the two auxiliary parameters of the algorithm , @xmath33 and @xmath36 , may be varied in the wide range without producing systematic errors , and that their influence on the results when exceeding this range can be controlled by examining the behavior of the autocorrelation functions .",
    "we have also estimated the dynamic exponent of the eic algorithm , and shown that it can be tuned by varying the auxiliary parameters .",
    "it is found to be larger than the one of the standard ic algorithm and generally smaller than the exponent of the sw algorithm .",
    "we also notice that , when the dynamical exponent is lowered and reaches beyond the li - sokal limit , the crossover to the nonequilibrium ic algorithm can be observed .",
    "we observe that both in the sw method and in the present eic calculations , the dynamical exponent does not change significantly with dimensionality and stays in the range between 0.4 and 0.5 in both cases , while the the li - sokal limit differs by more than twice between the two cases .",
    "the fact that within the eic algorithm the dynamical exponent @xmath0 may be tuned by changing the auxiliary parameters provides the means to make further analysis in order to better explain the reasons , still not well understood @xcite , why the equilibrium cluster algorithms like sw in some cases ( e.g. for 3d ising ) , have much larger dynamical exponent @xmath0 than required by the li - sokal limit .    due to its capability of self - tuning to the critical point",
    "there is a wide range of possible applications of the eic algorithm to phase transitions , where the critical temperature is not known in advance .",
    "one of the most appealing is certainly for simulations of phase transitions in presence of quenched disorder , where it provides the means to calculate critical properties at finite size critical temperature for each individual configuration at feasible time , which helps to overcome the problems related to the lack of self - averaging @xcite .",
    "the algorithm could also be generalized to other , or more complex problems such as the first order phase transition only briefly mentioned here , or to tricritical points , for which the extension of the standard ic algorithm was already applied @xcite .",
