    "quantum rabi model ( qrm ) describes a two - level atom ( qubit ) coupled to a cavity electromagnetic mode ( an oscillator )  @xcite , a minimalist paradigm of matter - light interactions with applications in numerous fields ranging from quantum optics , quantum information science to condensed matter physics .",
    "the solutions to the qrm are however highly nontrivial .",
    "whether an analytical exact solution even exists is uncertain for a long time .",
    "recently , braak presented an analytical exact solution  @xcite to the qrm using the representation of bosonic creation and annihilation operators in the bargmann space of analytical functions  @xcite .",
    "a so - called @xmath0-function with a single energy variable was derived yielding exact eigensolutions , which is not in the closed form but well defined mathematically .",
    "alternatively , using the method of extended coherent states ( ecs ) , this @xmath0-function was recovered in a simpler , yet physically more transparent manner by chen _",
    "et al . _",
    "braak s solution has stimulated extensive research interests in the single - qubit qrm  @xcite .",
    "as quantum information resources , such as the quantum entanglement  @xcite and the quantum discord  @xcite , can be easily stored in two qubits , two qubits in a common cavity have potential applications in quantum information technology .",
    "such a model system with two qubits now can be constructed in several solid devices  @xcite .",
    "recently , some analytical studies to the qrm with two qubits have been attempted within various approaches  @xcite . by using the ecs technique ,",
    "a @xmath0-function for the qrm with two equivalent qubits , resembling the simplest one without a determinant in the single - qubit qrm  @xcite , was obtained  @xcite .",
    "while in the bargmann representation , the @xmath0-function was built as a high order determinant , such as @xmath2 determinants for qrm with two different qubits  @xcite .    practically , the qrm with two arbitrary qubits is the most general one , and can be realized in experimental device with the greatest possibility .",
    "we believe that a simpler @xmath0-function is more convenient to obtain the eigensolutions , and can also shed light on many physical processes more clearly . in this work , employing the ecs , we demonstrate a successful derivation of a very concise @xmath0-function , which is just a @xmath3 determinant for the qrm with two arbitrary qubits .",
    "furthermore , for the same coupling , the @xmath0-function even for two different qubits can be reduced to a simplest one without the use of the determinant , like that in the single - qubit qrm  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the qrm with two qubits can be generally written as  @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the energy splitting of the @xmath6-th qubit , @xmath7 creates one photon in the common single - mode cavity with frequency @xmath8 , @xmath9 describes the coupling strength between the @xmath6-th qubit and the cavity , @xmath10 @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the usual pauli matrices of the @xmath6-th qubit . after a rotation with respect to the @xmath13-axis by an angle @xmath14 the hamiltonian in the two - qubit basis @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , which are eigenstates@xmath19of @xmath20 , can be written as the following symmetric matrix ( in unit of @xmath21 ) @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 .    for later use , we express the wavefunction in terms of the fock space as @xmath25 + b_n\\left [ \\left| 1,-1\\right\\rangle \\pm \\left ( -1\\right ) ^n\\left| -1,1\\right\\rangle \\right ] \\right\\ } |n\\rangle ,   \\label{wave_d}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 corresponds to even ( odd ) parity , @xmath27is the photonic number state .",
    "the schrdinger equation leads to the recurrence relation @xmath28 b_m-\\left ( m - e\\right ) a_m - ga_{m-1}}{g\\left ( m+1\\right ) } ,   \\nonumber \\\\",
    "b_{m+1 } & = & \\frac{\\left [ \\delta _ 2\\pm \\delta _ 1\\left ( -1\\right ) ^m\\right ] a_m-\\left ( m - e\\right ) b_m - g^{\\prime } b_{m-1}}{g^{\\prime } \\left ( m+1\\right ) } .",

    "the coefficients @xmath29 can be obtained in terms of two initial values of @xmath30 and @xmath31 recursively .    in this paper , we will first study the general case of different coupling strengths with the same cavity , then we turn to the special equal coupling case .      to employ the ecs approach , we first perform the following pair of bogoliubov transformations with finite displacements @xmath33 by which some diagonal matrix element @xmath10can be reduced to the free particle number operators plus a constant , which is very helpful for the further study .    the wavefunction can be expanded in the fock space of the operator @xmath34 @xmath35 |n\\rangle _ { a_{+ } } , \\label{wave_a+}\\ ] ] where@xmath36is the number state in the @xmath37-space , and termed as the ecs previously  @xcite .",

    "fortunately , they can be excluded very easily .",
    "they are very sensitive to the truncated number @xmath88 and can not converge with increasing @xmath88 , because the corresponding coefficients oscillate with increasing magnitudes as @xmath92 increases . in sharp contrast , for the stable zeros , the coefficients converges to zero rapidly with @xmath92 .",
