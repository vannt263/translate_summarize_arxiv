    "few of the rich and complex disciplines in astrophysics affect our understanding of the universe as deeply as the diffusion of ionizing radiation from stars and its interaction with surrounding matter .",
    "of all the known sinks and sources of energy , the ionizing radiation released by o stars during their short lives has great consequences by 1 ) determining the structure and energy balance of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in galaxies , 2 ) generating diagnostics of stellar populations and interstellar conditions , and 3 ) providing an important source of the lyman continuum radiation field during cosmic reionization .    the luminosity and spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of massive stars make them a powerful source of ionizing radiation within star forming galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "their power has been demonstrated by studies of nearby galaxies which show that the lyman - continuum ( lyc ) radiation from o - stars embedded within hii  regions , combined with those in the field , is luminous enough to balance the incessant recombination and cooling of the diffuse , warm ionized medium ( wim ) in galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; for a recent review of the wim see @xcite ) .",
    "radiative transfer calculations also demonstrate that injecting ionizing radiation from stars into the wim not only heats the gas , but also acts to decrease its cooling efficiency @xcite , preventing the catastrophic cooling of warm diffuse gas which would lead to unregulated star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in these ways , ionizing stellar radiation can strongly influence both the ism structure and star formation rates of galaxies .",
    "the h balmer recombination lines form beacons of star formation across the universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "when ionizing photons are all absorbed by gas , h recombination lines are an accurate diagnostic of @xmath4 , the rate at which h ionizing radiation is produced by stars .",
    "multiwavelength emission - line observations and theoretical stellar seds are routinely used with observed recombination rates to infer the stellar populations of distant galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "ionizing radiation from stars may ultimately escape into the intergalactic medium ( igm ) before being absorbed .",
    "this radiation may be an important source of the cosmic background uv field during the epoch of reionization , some time between redshift @xmath5 @xcite and @xmath6 @xcite . during this time",
    ", star - forming galaxies are believed to contribute 10 - 20% of their total ionizing radiation budget to sustain reionization , because the uv and x - ray field from agn alone was likely insufficient @xcite .",
    "recent detections of faint ly@xmath7 emitting galaxies by @xcite support this view with evidence that aggregate lyc radiation from faint galaxies during this epoch is sufficient to sustain cosmic reionization .    understanding the radiative transfer of lyc photons from massive stars",
    "is therefore a fundamental problem , and although they are well understood in general terms , hii  regions still present a computational challenge because of their greatly varying densities , small - scale structure , and irregular nature .",
    "consequently , @xcite identified radiative transfer of individual nebulae as the main bottleneck which limits our ability to determine the escape fraction of ionizing radiation from star forming galaxies in cosmological simulations .",
    "it is thus imperative to understand radiation transport within hii  regions if we are to understand fundamental properties of the universe .",
    "there has been a variety of approaches to evaluate the optical depth of hii  regions .",
    "the most direct method compares the ionization rate derived from  luminosities @xmath8 to that predicted from the observed ionizing stellar population . using this approach",
    ", @xcite found that up to half of all ionizing photons generated by stars escape hii  regions to ionize the wim , also known as diffuse ionized gas ( dig ) .",
    "however , theoretical predictions for the lyc photon emission rate @xmath4 have decreased significantly ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and are now generally consistent with the observed hii  region luminosities ( e.g. , @xcite ) . clearly , until the ionizing fluxes and seds of massive stars are definitively established , comparing predicted and observed @xmath8 will be subject to large systematic uncertainties .",
    "identifying all the ionizing stars is also difficult in regions with significant extinction and crowding .",
    "other studies attempt to evaluate nebular optical depth by modeling nebular emission lines from ions with different ionization potentials averaged over the entire hii  region ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , inhomogeneous , optically - thin nebulae may contain many optically - thick cloudlets . since the emission - line volume - emissivity is proportional to the square of the electron density , the resulting spatially integrated spectra",
    "can be dominated by these dense clumps and resemble the spectrum of an optically - thick , homogeneous nebula , despite small clump - covering - factors @xcite . typically , these studies do not resolve the spatial structure of the emitting gas .",
    "observations either integrate all the nebular light and lose all spatial information , or study structure from a single long slit spectrum . by simplifying the line fluxes of an entire hii  region to a single value , valuable information about the true structure of the gas is lost .",
    "the correlation between dig surface brightness and proximity to hiiregions is another key piece of evidence for the leakage of ionizing radiation from discrete hii  regions , and can be used to estimate the optical depth .",
    "@xcite used these correlations to test a model of m51 where leaking hii  regions explain the observed dig and  surface brightness distributions , similar to the method used by zurita et al .",
    "( 2002 ) in ngc  157 .",
    "however , @xcite found that this model requires a highly rarefied or porous ism with an anomalously low dust abundance .",
    "these details are inconsistent with the known properties of m51 , suggesting the models do not fully explain the propagation of radiation in real galaxies .",
    "thus , existing methods to determine nebular optical depth are subject to large uncertainties ; clearly it would be preferable to have a diagnostic that is reliable , effective and simple . here",
    ", we offer such a diagnostic , using an approach that makes it possible to accurately characterize the optical depth of individual hii  regions in the nearest galaxies . in  [ sec : method ] , we describe our method ; in  [ sec : ipmmcs ] , we apply our technique to the magellanic clouds , and use it to generate a new , physically motivated hii  region catalog ; and we evaluate our technique in  [ sec : hiitau ] .",
    "our results yield powerful new insights on the radiative transfer of lyc radiation from massive stars in these galaxies , which we present in  [ sec : globfesc ] .",
    "with the recent availability of wide - field , narrow - band imaging and tunable filters , the potential of spatially resolved , emission - line diagnostics as constraints on nebular models is being more fully realized , and these techniques can now be applied to entire populations of extragalactic nebulae . we revisit a largely overlooked approach , ionization - parameter mapping ( ipm ) , which is capable of directly assessing the optical depth of ionizing radiation in individual hii  regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the technique is based on emission - line ratio mapping , which has been previously employed ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; here , we present a modern development , demonstration , and application .",
    "the current approach is driven by newly available data with unprecedented sensitivity , resolution , and spatial completeness .",
    "we leverage this data against recent developments in the ability to predict spatially resolved , emission line diagnostics with photoionization models .",
    "our method thus balances the quantitative diagnostics of spectroscopy and the spatial coverage of imaging , yielding a powerful method that is both observationally efficient and straightforward enough to be applied to entire galaxies .      for classic , optically - thick hii  regions ,",
    "there is a transition zone between the central , highly excited region and the neutral environment .",
    "these transition zones are characterized by a strong decrease in the excitation , and hence also in the gas ionization parameter , which traces the degree of ionization and photon - to - gas density .",
    "figure [ fig : structure]@xmath9 and [ fig : structure]@xmath10 show the radial ionic structure of strmgren spheres generated by a 38,000 k and 43,000 k star , respectively .",
    "these demonstrate the transition from highly ionized inner zones dominated by  and  to outer envelopes dominated by  and . the low - ionization transition zone is thicker than the narrow h@xmath11/h@xmath12 ionization front where the  volume emissivity peaks @xcite ; this results from the sensitivity of the /  ratio to the radial difference between the  and @xmath13  recombination fronts , which are in turn determined by the lyc optical depth @xmath14 and stellar effective temperature @xmath15 .",
    "this large scale gradient is a key feature to the application of ionization parameter mapping at great distances . for the models in figure  [ fig : structure ] ,",
    "the assumed ionizing sed is a single wm - basic stellar atmosphere @xcite defined by a variable @xmath15 and fixed @xmath16 , equivalent to one o6  v star .",
    "calculations were performed using the cloudy photoionization code , version c08.00 @xcite , adopting gas - phase abundances equal to those of the 30  doradus star - forming region , having log(o / h ) = @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "our models include dust with a gas - to - dust ratio of @xmath18 , which is consistent with the ionized gas studied by @xcite .",
    "we use dust with an lmc size - distribution described by @xcite , although our results are not sensitive to the dust abundance .",
    "the initial h density @xmath19 is equal to @xmath20 , and the distance @xmath21 between the illuminated face of the cloud and the ionizing source .",
    "deeper in the cloud @xmath22 is set by a hydrostatic equation of state with no magnetic field ( @xmath23  g ) described in @xcite .",
    "of 0.5 , 1.0 , and 10 . a uniform background is assumed , and the units on both axes are in arcsec , projecting the objects at the lmc distance . ]        figure  [ fig : structure ] demonstrates that we can estimate @xmath24 from the observed ion stratification within the nebula , which depends strongly on .",
    "while nebulae ionized by different  have greatly differing structure , the optical depth is strongly constrained by the radial structure in two ions , and essentially uniquely determined by three ions .",
    "figure [ fig : lmc_models_nh_10 ] shows models of the observed surface - brightness ratios for the @xmath25 and @xmath26 emission lines for a series of hii  regions with lmc element abundances .",
    "we calculate the projected 2d surface brightness of our models according to equation 2 of  @xcite using the surfbright routine , which is described in appendix a. we have added a constant , noiseless background of @xmath27 , consistent with typical hii  region observations .",
    "we note that decreasing the background component will enhance the predicted contrast , while an increase reduces contrast .",
    "the model parameters of these simulations are similar to those of the models in figure  [ fig : structure ] .",
    "the nebulae are ionized by a single wm - basic @xcite stellar sed with an ionizing luminosity equivalent to a cluster of ten o6 v stars , and @xmath15 equal to 30,500 k , 38,000 k or 44,500 k. these @xmath15 correspond to o9.5 v , o6 v and o3 v spectral types , respectively , using the spectral type ",
    "@xmath28 calibration of  @xcite . a single",
    "is often used to represent the sed of ionizing clusters , which is a reasonable approximation since the earliest spectral type dominates the sed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig : lmc_models_nh_10 ] shows models for @xmath29 1.0 , and 10.0 , at each , where the cloud is truncated at various radii to simulate the different @xmath24 .",
    "figure  [ fig : lmc_models_nh_10 ] demonstrates how the optical depth and  determine the observed ionic structure that is rendered by ionization - parameter mapping .",
    "in general , the @xmath30 models show no low - ionization transition layer , although there is an exception for the latest spectral type . for early and mid - o spectral types ,",
    "the morphology in these ionization - parameter maps is an especially strong discriminant for the optical depth . and",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : structure ] ,  can be fully constrained when surface - brightness ratios are obtained for three radially varying ions instead of two .",
    "we further discuss the use and limitations of our method in  [ sec : limitations ] below .",
    "figure [ fig : dems38_s2o3 ] shows the observed ratio map of /  for a star - forming complex centered on the nebula dem  s38 , from the magellanic clouds emission - line survey ( mcels ; @xcite ) .",
    "we clearly see an envelope of low - ionization gas surrounding a high - excitation interior in each hii  region marked with an x ( dem  s38 and the two regions to the north and south ) , strongly suggesting that these objects are optically thick .",
    "in contrast , the nebula east of dem  s38 shows high ionization throughout , and no evidence of an internal gradient in gas ionization state .",
    "this indicates that the object is optically thin .",
    "we also see that the object dem  s159 ( figure [ fig : dems159_s2o3 ] ) shows the intermediate morphology of a blister - like hii  region . like dem  s38 ,",
    "there is a central region of highly ionized gas , but a transition zone of weakly ionized gas is found only to the north , while toward the south , the nebula remains highly ionized throughout , like our = 0.5 models in figure  [ fig : lmc_models_nh_10 ] .",
    "since all of the nebula is ionized by the same sed , dem  s159 must be optically thick to the north , and optically thin to the south .",
    "thus , figures  [ fig : dems38_s2o3 ] and [ fig : dems159_s2o3 ] vividly demonstrate the viability of ionization - parameter mapping as a technique to evaluate .",
    "the morphology of the ionization structure in these objects is qualitatively consistent with our models , and in  [ sec : hiitau ] below , we also show quantitatively that observations are consistent with predictions .",
    "furthermore , the contrasting gas morphology between the spherical , optically thick nebulae and the irregular , optically thin object in figure  [ fig : dems38_s2o3 ] is not a coincidence . in the mcels data for the magellanic clouds ,",
    "most of the optically thick objects showing low - ionization envelopes look like classical , spherical , strmgren spheres .",
    "the opposite is true for optically thin objects , which are more complex and irregular in morphology .",
    "this is consistent with recent radiation - mhd simulations by @xcite , which show that the highly ionized , density - bounded nebulae powered by the hottest stars are subject to strong radiative feedback and gas instabilities , generating irregular gas morphologies .",
    "thus , the gas morphologies are fully consistent with the interpretation that objects having low - ionization transition zones are generally optically thick and radiation - bounded .",
    "finally , ionization - parameter mapping also constrains the optical depth in the line of sight , since the low - ionization , transition zone should also exist along these photon paths in an optically thick nebula .",
    "this was explored by @xcite who found a lower limit of /  @xmath31 for lmc nebulae that are optically thick in the line of sight .",
    "lower values of /  indicate that the low - ionization transition zone is missing or depleted , and therefore that the region is optically thin to the lyman continuum . in figure",
    "[ fig : profile ] we compare the line of sight emission line ratios of dem  s15 and n59 , a pair of optically thick and optically thin hii  regions .",
    "dem  s15 is a classical strmgren sphere , limb - brightened in the lower ionization species , and it shows a central line - of - sight /@xmath32 , consistent with an optically thick nebula of smc metallicity .",
    "in contrast , in n59 , the central /  ratio is essentially zero across much of the object , and thus no transition zone is seen in those sight lines , demonstrating that the object is optically thin .",
    "ionization - parameter mapping is tremendously powerful , and can even be done with only two radially varying ions .",
    "when using only two ions , we caution that the technique has three limitations .",
    "ostensibly , the most important quantity to be derived with this technique is the escape fraction of lyc photons from an individual hii  region , defined as @xmath33 ionization - parameter mapping based on only two ions can provide only lower limits on , because the observed morphology becomes degenerate at high .",
    "this can be seen in the bottom row of figure [ fig : lmc_models_nh_10 ] for @xmath34 , which corresponds to @xmath35 . in these cases",
    ", background emission masks the very faint , lower - ionization emission lines in fully ionized gas , and the ratio ceases to directly track changes in the hii  region ionization structure .",
    "this problem worsens as @xmath28 increases , and it becomes more difficult to identify the transition to neutral gas .",
    "however , only the hottest ionizing stars in the local universe will have @xmath36 k , and when three ions are available , the degeneracies are resolved .",
    "there is also a degeneracy between optically thin nebulae ionized by cool stars ( @xmath37 ) and optically thick regions heated by hotter stars .",
    "the degeneracy exists where cool stars do not emit much radiation above 35 ev to generate o@xmath38 , and so these nebulae are entirely dominated by o@xmath39 .",
    "again , ionization parameter mapping based on three ions , adding s@xmath38 for example , can resolve the degeneracy ( figure  [ fig : structure ] ) .",
    "however , we stress that this problem applies primarily to the lowest - luminosity objects , and as we show below , their aggregate luminosity is insignificant compared to the total amount of energy found to be escaping all hii  regions .    finally , we again caution that for a population of randomly oriented blister hii  regions , it is likely that the orientation of some objects will cause a projected ionization - parameter gradient that appears optically thick on the limb , but is optically thin in the line of sight .",
    "the most extreme example is of a half - sphere , blister nebula viewed directly face - on : despite having @xmath40 , the projected region is circular and will show an ionization transition zone associated with the optically thick half .",
    "however , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : evalnebtau ] , the ionic ratios of , , and across the central region of these nebulae should show a deficit in lower - ionization species that is incompatible with optically thick models ( figure  [ fig : n59 ] ) . with further constraints on the ionizing sed and a quantitative evaluation of these ratios ,",
    "we can still measure their optical depth .",
    "thus , there may be instances where optically thin hii  regions are initially misidentified as optically thick , but these can be identified by quantitative examination of spatially resolved ionic ratios . if objects are misidentified , this again would favor underestimates of .",
    "lcccc lmc & @xmath41 & 3.5 & @xmath42 & @xmath43 + smc & @xmath44 & 3.6 & @xmath45 & @xmath46 [ tab : mcels ]            hence , the caveats identified above can be resolved by ionization - parameter mapping in three ions and quantitative evaluation of the entire nebular projection .",
    "we note that these fairly manageable issues all work to underestimate the optical depth of hii  regions .",
    "thus , ionization - parameter mapping shows great promise as a powerful tool in studies of the ism .",
    "emission - line ratio maps neutralize variations in surface brightness , clearly revealing changes in ionization structure for bright and faint regions alike .",
    "the power of the technique is that it allows us to identify optically thin hiiregions by the absence of the low - ionization envelope , which almost always indicates that the nebula is density - bounded .",
    "we now apply our technique of ionization - parameter mapping to the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) and small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , which have been mapped with narrow - band emission - line imaging by the mcels survey .",
    "this is a spatially complete , flux - limited survey carried out at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) with the university of michigan s curtis 0.6/0.9 m schmidt telescope .",
    "over the course of 5 years , the lmc and smc were imaged in @xmath47 ,  @xmath485007 , and , with respective filter widths of 50 , 40 and 30 .",
    "the  filter bandpass includes [ n  ii]@xmath496548,6584 at a reduced throughput . the final product , mosaics in both low and high - ionization line emission , and in the  recombination line , traces the ionized ism at both large and small scales .",
    "the process of mosaicking the images resulted in a binned pixel scale of 3.0 and 2.0 arcsec pixel@xmath50 for the lmc and smc , respectively .",
    "these correspond to a spatial scale of 0.7 pc and 0.6 pc for distances of 49 kpc  @xcite and 61 kpc @xcite , respectively , with an effective resolution of @xmath51 arcsec .",
    "the 1-@xmath52 surface - brightness limit of each band is listed in table  [ tab : mcels ] .",
    "these are the sensitivities per pixel , expressed as surface brightness in @xmath53 and  emission measure ( em ) in @xmath54 .",
    "such depth is important to form a complete understanding of the wim ionization , and the dependence of  on star - formation intensity and hii  region properties .",
    "the mcels survey includes continuum observations centered at 5130  and 6850   , with effective bandpasses of 155    and 95    , respectively .",
    "these were used to produce a continuum - subtracted mosaic of the smc @xcite .",
    "based on spectrophotometric observations of the smc region ngc 346 by @xcite , we estimate that the flux calibration of the continuum - subtracted data has uncertainties on the order of 20% . at present , the lmc data are not yet continuum - subtracted . to flux - calibrate the lmc data , we used spectrophotometric observations by  @xcite , extracting mcels line fluxes along the length of slit position 5 in that paper to determine the flux constants .",
    "we also compare against the flux - calibrated , narrow - band data obtained on the soar telescope in a 30 arcsec circular aperture at the position , @xmath55 05:38:56.9 , @xmath5669:05:21.8 ( j2000 ) @xcite .",
    "we find that the comparisons agree within approximately 20% , which then corresponds to the systematic uncertainty in our flux calibration .",
    "we generated line - ratio maps of /  for both the lmc and smc using iraf , with the lmc maps based on non - continuum - subtracted emission - line images , and the smc maps based on continuum - subtracted images .",
    "these ratio maps , which probe the ionization parameter in the ionized gas , are shown in figures  [ fig : lmcs2o3 ] and  [ fig : smcs2o3 ] , respectively .",
    "ionization - parameter mapping allows us to assign physically - motivated hii  region boundaries in complex , confused regions with multiple ionizing sources . in areas where hii  regions are overlapping , or",
    "are found in complex ionized backgrounds , the ionization stratification makes it possible to isolate individual photoionized regions , which is impossible with imaging in only  or any single line .",
    "in particular , ionization - parameter mapping allows us to define nebular boundaries based on both ionization structure and  surface brightness @xmath57 ( ) morphology .",
    "the examples in figure  [ fig : enhancementexample ] demonstrate how ionization - parameter mapping generates contrast between the dig and low surface - brightness , extended hii  regions that are independently ionized entities . in the  image ( right panel of figure  [ fig : enhancementexample ] ) , the objects dem  s10 and dem  s49 are amorphous regions that blend into the surrounding dig with ambiguous boundaries . in contrast , the /  ratio map clearly shows them as distinct regions . the boundaries of optically thick objects are usually unambiguous because these are characterized by a stratified ionization structure as described above , accompanied by a sharp decrease in surface brightness .",
    "since previous nebular catalogs for the magellanic clouds are based only on  morphology ( e.g. , @xcite ) , we use these more sophisticated criteria based on ionization - parameter mapping to compile a more physically - based catalog of hii  regions in these galaxies . in the case of",
    "extended , optically thin objects that show only gradual changes in /  or / , we define the hii  region boundary to be the point at which either the  or the ionic ratio become indistinguishable from the dig , whichever is larger in size .",
    "we defined photometric apertures with polygons in saoimage ds9 , for both target objects and local background regions ; we used the funcnts routine from funtoolsjohn / funtools/ ] to measure the fluxes .",
    "the photometry of faint objects , especially seen in and  filters , are at risk of being contaminated by stellar continuum in the lmc , where our data are not continuum subtracted .",
    "we minimize this contamination by avoiding foreground galactic stars and also sampling the local density of field stars with our background apertures . despite the careful creation of apertures",
    ", the difference between stellar populations inside and outside the hii regions may still introduce significant errors , since the most massive , brightest stars often reside within hii regions .",
    "thus , errors in the background subtraction dominate the flux uncertainties for both galaxies , and they are largest for low surface - brightness objects .",
    "we therefore find that the median local background surface brightness for nebulae in the lmc is larger than for the smc : @xmath58 and @xmath59 , respectively , in .",
    "however , we stress that high surface - brightness emission dominates most objects , yielding median background uncertainties of 6% and 8% in the lmc and smc , respectively . for the lmc",
    ", the discrete stellar contributions can increase this uncertainty to about 18% .",
    "this is consistent with a comparison of our background - subtracted fluxes of bright , isolated lmc and smc hii  regions to their fluxes reported by @xcite .",
    "we find that the independent measurements agree within 20% , which now also includes systematic uncertainties .",
    "we further explored the limiting case of applying a constant background to all objects .",
    "for the lmc , we calculated this background from the mean of three locations , two in the north and one in the south to estimate the contamination from sources producing a constant background such as the sky , large scale diffuse emission , etc .",
    "we find the mean , constant background @xmath60 .",
    "for the smc , we determined the background of the continuum - subtracted  image to be consistent with zero ( @xmath61 ; cf .",
    "table  [ tab : mcels ] ) . for both galaxies ,",
    "subtracting the median backgrounds affects the resulting @xmath8 by no more than 0.2 dex , and does not substantively change our results .",
    "our hii  region catalogs for the lmc and smc defined with these ionization - based criteria are presented in appendix  b , tables  [ tab : lmcobjs ] and [ tab : smcobjs ] , which give luminosities and associated hi  column densities for 401 objects in the lmc , and 214 in the smc .",
    "we find that our hii  region boundaries and  luminosities generally agree with those determined in previous , -only studies by , e.g. , @xcite , including the substructure in most of the dem @xcite and @xcite surveys .",
    "this is especially true for simple objects with a low local background .",
    "figures [ fig : lmc_lf ] and [ fig : smc_lf ] show the differential hiiregion luminosity functions ( hii  lf ) for our new lmc and smc catalogs , respectively ( squares ) , together with those generated by @xcite ( crosses ) , fitted above @xmath62 ( where not explicitly stated , the units of  are ) .",
    "the power - law slope of the lmc hii  lf reported by kennicutt et al . is @xmath63 , where @xmath64 this is statistically consistent with the fitted hii  lf slope for our data , @xmath65 .",
    "an identical analysis for the smc , as shown in figure  [ fig : smc_lf ] , yields an hii  lf slope of @xmath66 , for our new catalog , compared to a reported slope of 1.9 from @xcite .",
    "thus , although previous measurements of the hii  lf do not use our ionization - based criteria , they result in essentially identical lf slopes .",
    "both magellanic cloud hii  lf slopes flatten around @xmath67 , which is equivalent to @xmath68 .",
    "this flattening is observed in other galaxies whose hii  lfs probe @xmath69 , including the milky way @xcite , m51 @xcite and m31 @xcite .",
    "the observed flattening of the hii  lf in this regime was predicted in monte carlo simulations by @xcite and @xcite , and it is caused by stochastic ionizing populations at these low luminosities . for comparison ,",
    "@xmath70 is the luminosity of the orion nebula , whose parent ionizing cluster has a mass of 4500  @xcite , dominated by a single o6.5 v star .    a final caveat : at the lowest luminosities , there is a decrease in the hii  lfs",
    "this is clearly established for @xmath71 in both galaxies .",
    "the drop in source counts could be an indication that below this  we are not complete .",
    "alternatively , since the stellar ionizing fluxes plummet strongly for stars later than early b spectral types , this turnover in the hii  lf signals an intrinsically different class of ionizing sources and nebular objects .",
    "these must include individual hii  regions of later b - type stars , and perhaps some faint , optically thin nebulae that are intrinsically weak in recombination lines due to their low optical depth .",
    "there also may be some shock - heated filaments , although we tried to avoid most of these .",
    "planetary nebulae should not be important above @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "the technique of ionization - parameter mapping is effective at highlighting large , extremely faint structures .",
    "the /  ratio map of an lmc object at @xmath73 04:55:50 @xmath74 67:30:50 ( j2000 ) is shown in the left panel of figure [ fig : mystery ] , with an inner ellipse to mark the extent of highly ionized and filamentary gas .",
    "the middle panel shows a larger contour that highlights an hi cavity seen in the hi  data of @xcite with a major axis of 550 pc and hicolumn density @xmath1  @xmath75 .",
    "both ellipses have the same orientation suggesting they are related .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : mystery ] shows faint  emission is co - spatial with the , while no  was detected .",
    "this indicates that the optically emitting gas is fully ionized .",
    "this structure is intriguing because the /  morphology is similar to optically thin nebulae ionized by ob stars , yet no ionization sources are known in the region , nor is there evidence of a prior supernova or shocked gas .",
    "the size and faintness of this highly excited region , together with the lack of an ionization source , make this object unique .",
    "further observations to identify its nature and origin are required .    .",
    "from the diagnostics based on ionization structure as described in  [ sec : method ] , we classify the optical depth of our individual , catalogued hii  regions into the following categories : ( 0 ) indeterminate , ( 1 ) optically thick , ( 2 ) blister , ( 3 ) optically thin , and ( 4 ) shocked nebulae .",
    "these are given in column 4 of tables  [ tab : lmcobjs ] and [ tab : smcobjs ] .",
    "class 0 objects , with indeterminate optical depth , fall into two categories : those which lack  emission , causing a high /  ratio , with little ionization structure ; and large scale , diffuse structures .",
    "this latter category is difficult to define morphologically , but since many objects in the dem lmc catalog include these features , we have attempted to catalog them as well .",
    "we define optically thick objects ( class 1 ) to be those showing classic , low - ionization envelopes enclosing at least 2/3 of the central , high - ionization regions in projection , as described in  [ sec : method ] .",
    "blister nebulae ( class 2 ) are defined by a low - ionization envelope that surrounds between 1/3 and 2/3 of the observed object ; additionally , objects having complex internal ionization fronts with extended [ o iii ] emission are treated as blisters . optically thin ( class 3 ) objects show low / throughout , with low - ionization envelopes covering @xmath76 1/3 of the highly ionized gas ( see figures  [ fig : dems38_s2o3 ] and [ fig : dems159_s2o3 ] ) .",
    "shocked objects ( class 4 ) are characterized by an ionization structure which is inverted relative to photoionization , i.e. these objects are have enhanced  emission surrounding strong .",
    "our survey is not intended to be complete with respect to shocked objects , and we typically avoided cataloguing them .",
    "since these are not photoionized , they are excluded from further consideration .",
    "additional general classification criteria include gradients in ionization parameter , the detection of ionization fronts distinct from the background , and the ionized extent of the object .",
    "radial projections of the /  ratio , were made to assess the significance of specific individual features that were identified .",
    "three of the authors ( ewp , jz , and aej ) used these criteria to carry out independent classifications of all the objects .",
    "to arrive at a final catalog , we resolved the differences by discussing specific key features and quantitatively measuring the optically thin covering fraction .",
    "we roughly estimate the lyc escape fraction @xmath77 for each object in classes ( 1 )  ( 3 ) as follows : optically thick objects are assigned @xmath78 ; optically thin objects are assigned @xmath79 , which corresponds to @xmath80 ; and blister objects are assigned a value of @xmath77 that is half that for the optically thin objects , namely , @xmath81",
    ". since we have observations in only two diagnostic ions , some of the class 3 objects in reality may be quite optically thin (  [ sec : limitations ] ) , and so we compare these estimates to direct measurements of optical depths using data from @xcite , who compared the observed  to predicted values based on the spectral types of individual ionizing stars for a sample of lmc hii  regions .",
    "although , as mentioned earlier , there is considerable uncertainty in optical depth estimates based on this method , it remains the most direct , quantitative way to check our results based on ionization - parameter mapping .",
    "@xcite adopted ionizing fluxes from the wm - basic models of @xcite . these seds are intermediate in hardness among the different available , modern codes , and they best fit the observed nebular emission - line spectra @xcite . due to the large uncertainty in determining spectral types of o stars from photometry alone ,",
    "we restrict our comparison with the @xcite sample ( their tables 1 and 3 ) to objects having stellar spectral types determined at least in part by spectroscopic classifications , with a further requirement that at least half of the derived ionizing luminosity is attributed to stars with spectroscopic spectral types .",
    "these include a reanalysis of hii  regions from @xcite , which is based entirely on spectroscopic classifications with individually measured reddenings , listed in table  1 of voges et al .",

    "l 293 is observationally attributed to only a single o3  iii star .",
    "however , given the typical cluster mass in which o3  iii stars form , additional , obscured or overlooked ionization sources in this cluster are likely to be present . in particular , @xcite identified an odd semi - stellar source within dem l 293 which is brighter than the single o3  iii star .",
    "if the ionizing luminosity of this source is equal to an o3  iii star then the v08  would then be -0.52 , much closer to the  value derived from ionization - parameter mapping .",
    "overall , however , our extremely crude estimates of  based on ionization - parameter mapping show surprisingly good agreement with the empirically measured . in spite of the fact that our estimates tend to yield lower limits , the general agreement confirms that objects appearing to be optically thick indeed tend to be radiation - bounded . as mentioned in  [ sec : evalnebtau ] , this is also supported by their morphologies , which generally resemble smooth , strmgren spheres .",
    "furthermore , the occurrence of optically thick objects that appear to be density - bounded is extremely rare , since this only happens occasionally for the very hottest spectral types ( e.g. , figure  [ fig : lmc_models_nh_10 ] ) .",

    "table  [ tab : medhii ] also shows that the frequencies of optically thin objects , including blisters , are similar between the two galaxies , 40% and 33% in the lmc and smc , respectively .",
    "furthermore , there is a transition luminosity above which optically - thin nebulae dominate , @xmath70 , occurring at the same luminosity in both galaxies .",
    "@xcite speculated that such a transition is responsible for possible discontinuities observed near @xmath87 in extragalactic hii  lfs , but our data clearly show that optically thin objects dominate at luminosities a full 1.6  dex lower in .",
    "it will be interesting to see how strongly our transition value of @xmath70 depends on galaxy properties .",
    "this relatively low luminosity corresponds to nebulae ionized stochastically by single o stars or substantially evolved associations and clusters @xcite .",

    "these are indeed found to be optically thin in our study , a result consistent with the findings of @xcite in 30 dor , and the low optical depths found for other giant extragalactic hii  regions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the contrast in ionization morphology between the two galaxies is striking .",
    "as ionizing radiation enters the diffuse ism , it encounters a combination of ionized and neutral gas .",
    "the lmc neutral disk has been disrupted , forming shells and filaments surrounding the ionized gas @xcite .",
    "these structures are believed to be the result of stellar feedback acting on the ism ( e.g. @xcite ) . often , optically thin hii  regions line the edges of large hishells , radiating lyc photons into their interiors .",
    "a few examples are highlighted with arrows in the lmc ( figure  [ fig:3phasecolor ] ) .",
    "these large - scale hi  structures appear to allow ionizing radiation to travel hundreds of pc without being absorbed .",
    "the smc , on the other hand , has a less fragmented hi  structure @xcite .",
    "the neutral ism in this galaxy is much more diffuse and less filamentary than that in the lmc @xcite .",

    "lines of sight toward this optically thin region show that @xmath1  anti - correlates with highly ionized gas ( figure  [ fig:3phasecolor ] ) .",

    "the second region is located in the sw portion of the galaxy . despite a high @xmath1",

    "the region is seen in figure  [ fig : smc_sw ] in the inverted map ( left ) and @xmath1  ( right ) .",
    "the enhanced sensitivity reveals an ionization transition zone coincident with the edge of the hi  distribution .",
    "thus , the hi  gas appears to be trapping the ionizing radiation , while individual nebular  depends on the detailed morphology .    given the strong morphological contrast between the two galaxies , in the hi  properties and star - formation intensity , the quantitative similarities in the nebular optical depths found above in  [ sec : hiitau ] are surprising .",
    "in particular , despite expectations that the reduced @xmath1  and higher star - formation intensity of the lmc would lead to more optically thin nebulae , we saw above that the relative frequency of optically thin and thick objects are similar between the two galaxies ( table  [ tab : medhii ] ) .",
    "it will be important to see whether other galaxies also yield similar relative frequencies .",
    "figure  [ fig : hidist ] shows the @xmath1  distribution for optically thin ( thin lines ) and thick nebulae ( thick lines ) for the lmc ( solid blue lines ) and smc ( dotted red lines ) .",
    "we used the @xmath1  maps of @xcite for the lmc and @xcite for the smc , to average the @xmath1  within the individual hii  region apertures for each object , as defined in ",
    "[ sec : ibhiicat ] .",
    "we caution that these measurements correspond to the @xmath1  along the line of sight toward the objects . because the smc has a more three - dimensional geometry than the lmc , which is an almost face - on disk ,",
    "the @xmath1measurements for the smc include a larger contribution from foreground and background ism than in the lmc",
    ". however , we note that the smc metallicity and dust content are only one - fifth that of the lmc ; thus , for the same @xmath1 ,  will be lower in the smc .",
    "hence the less abundant dust may somewhat offset the effect of increased @xmath1  in this galaxy .",
    "still , because of the contrasting galaxy morphologies , the difference in median @xmath1  between optically thin and thick populations within each galaxy is smaller than the difference in global median @xmath1  between the two galaxies .",
    "specifically , the median value of all lmc hii  regions is 2.4 times lower than in the smc ( table  [ tab : medhii ] ) , while the ratio of the median @xmath1  for optically thick ( class 1 ) to thin ( class 2 @xmath85 3 ) objects is 1.5 and 1.2 in the lmc and smc , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : hidist ] shows that , for both galaxies , the @xmath1distributions for optically thin and thick nebulae are similar to each other , but that the former are weighted more toward lower columns , as expected . however , we note that even in the lmc , which has minimal line - of - sight projection effects , the @xmath1  distribution for optically thin objects extends up to @xmath1@xmath91 , a value as high as that for the optically thick ones .    distributions for optically thin and optically thick nebulae , shown with thin and thick lines , respectively . the lmc and smc distributions are shown with solid lines ( blue ) and dashed lines ( red ) , respectively .",
    "these have been scaled by the total number of objects in each group . ]    in figure [ fig : frac_hi ] we show the relative frequency of optically thin nebulae as a function of @xmath1  in the lmc and smc . as expected , we see a strong decrease in the frequency of optically thin objects with increasing hi  column , although as emphasized above , there are still optically thin objects found near the highest @xmath1 . in both galaxies , there is a transition @xmath1  below which optically - thin nebulae constitute the majority , at @xmath92 in the lmc , and @xmath93 in the smc .",
    "the smc transition @xmath1  is two times higher than in lmc , which is consistent with the 2.4 times higher median @xmath1  value for all hii  regions in the lmc relative to the smc , due to line - of - sight ism projection .",
    "thus , in spite of the very different hi  morphology between the two galaxies , the quantitative relationship between nebular optical depth and hi  column is remarkably similar .",
    "while the frequency of optically thin vs thick hii  regions is similar in both galaxies , it is the structure of the diffuse ism that ultimately determines how many ionizing photons heat the galaxy , and how many escape into the igm , a quantity crucial to our understanding of cosmic evolution .",
    "figure  [ fig:3phasecolor ] highlights how , in comparison to the smc , the evacuated ism of the lmc allows the radiation produced in these regions to travel farther , and perhaps leave the galaxy . in the smc",
    "much of the ionizing radiation escaping hii  regions is unable to penetrate the higher apparent hi  column .",
    "we now explore the global escape fractions for the magellanic clouds .",
    "@xcite highlighted the importance of hii  region location on the escape of ionizing radiation from galaxies . in the lmc and smc ,",
    "the largest and most luminous hii  regions are found toward the galaxy edges , and these objects are apparently optically thin .",

    "the predicted  luminosity is @xmath95 , implying @xmath96% , consistent with our estimate of 30% from ionization - parameter mapping .",
    "as the eastern - most known smc hii  region , its blister opens away from the galaxy , making it a prime candidate to contribute to the galactic escape fraction .",
    "the escaping uv radiation would be detectable only from certain directions as predicted by @xcite .",
    "the most luminous hii  region in the lmc is 30 doradus , ionized by the cluster r136a .",
    "it has a reddened luminosity of @xmath97 , and it is ionized by hundreds of o stars .",
    "similarly , at @xmath98 , the brightest nebula in the smc is n66 , ionized by at least 30 o stars in the cluster ngc 346 .",
    "we can see in figures  [ fig : lmcs2o3 ] and [ fig : smcs2o3 ] that these luminous objects are strongly optically thin , based on their very extended  emission .",
    "furthermore , they are not deeply embedded in their respective galaxies , implying that these massive regions produce ionizing radiation that may escape into the igm .    to examine the lyc photon path lengths from these two , luminous objects , we show the azimuthally averaged /  ratio for these regions in figure  [ fig:30dor_n66_radial ] , centered on the main ionizing clusters r136a ( top ) , and ngc 346 ( bottom ) .",
    "small , discrete hii  regions that are projected in the line of sight within these regions are excluded from the azimuthal averages in figure  [ fig:30dor_n66_radial ] .",
    "figure [ fig:30dor_n66_radial ] also shows the average radial @xmath1 .",
    "the profile of 30 doradus is plotted to maximum radii where the gradient of both quantities is equal to zero , and marks the distance at which the ionizing radiation from these sources is no longer dominant .",
    "n66 is fainter , so it is less clear exactly where the influence of its ionizing source ends .",
    "clearly , the extended  emission from the gas surrounding both objects requires a photoionizing source of high - energy photons from r136a and ngc 346 , which dominate the ionization of the dig out to at least 600 pc , whether or not this gas was ever associated with the hii  region , or is just part of the dig .",

    "nearby h  ii regions falling within the annuli were masked . ]",
    "figure  [ fig:30dor_n66_radial ] shows that the peak @xmath1  associated with optically thin objects can occur at radial distances that are well within the radial limits of the photoionized region .",
    "this suggests that the neutral and molecular ism is highly inhomogeneous and clumpy , with large holes or clear areas that allow the escape of ionizing radiation .",
    "this situation is similar to the ionization cone detected in ngc 5253 @xcite . in particular , the radial bins used to produce figure  [ fig:30dor_n66_radial ] mask important features in the /  and @xmath1  distributions around 30 doradus .",
    "these include narrow , radial projections containing continuous regions of highly ionized gas extending 1 kpc in various directions from 30 doradus .",
    "there is no evidence for additional ionizing sources that can explain the extended ionization , so we argue that the variation in path length is due to variations in ism density . east of the ionizing source , r136a , we see a complex of edge - on filaments ( figure [ fig:30dor_filaments ] ) , associated with the giant hi  shell lmc  2 @xcite .",
    "these filaments form a continuous arc over 500  pc in length , at a distance ranging from 0.6 and 0.8  kpc from r136a , with strong  facing the ionizing cluster , and strong  facing away from it , as shown by the arrows in the figure .",
    "this ionic stratification confirms that the ionizing photons striking these filaments or sheets originate from r136a .",
    "similar filaments are detected west of n66 ( figure  [ fig : smcrgb ] ) , opposite the bulk of the smc .",
    "unfortunately , our data do not extend far enough to look for filaments beyond dem s167 in the direction away from the smc .",
    "however , we see that both the location and luminosity of these giant hii  regions strongly influence the likelihood of lyc radiation escaping from the host galaxies .      to understand the lyman - continuum radiation transfer within galaxies , it is of central interest to evaluate the luminosity - weighted , mean lyc escape fraction  of all the nebulae within each galaxy .",
    "we first calculate the total hii  region `` escape luminosity ''  in terms of individual , observed hiiregion luminosities using @xmath99 where @xmath100 represents the @xmath101 object in the given galaxy .",
    "note that  is the observed luminosity , as before , which is related to the total ionizing luminosity @xmath102 by @xmath103 .",
    "we again adopt @xmath80 for optically thin nebulae and 0.3 for blister regions .",
    "optically thick nebulae contribute no escaping radiation , but add to the total observed  luminosity .",
    "the total escape luminosities for the individual object classes are listed in table  [ tab : fesc_results ] .",
    "the total  from all hii  regions in the galaxies are @xmath104 @xmath105 in the lmc , and @xmath104 @xmath106 in the smc .",
    "next , we calculate the luminosity - weighted hii  region escape fraction in each galaxy according to , @xmath107 we find the lower limit on  in the lmc and smc to be 0.42@xmath1080.51 and 0.40 , respectively .",
    "the lower lmc value corresponds to a scenario where indeterminate , class 0 objects are optically thick , while the upper limit assumes they are optically thin . in the lmc these objects account for @xmath109% of the total hii  region luminosity , while they do not make any significant contribution in the smc .",
    "we have not included the uncertainty due to photometry , which is 20% for individual objects , and introduces an error of 22% to our  calculations",
    ". therefore , our final lower limits on  in the lmc and smc are 0.42@xmath1100.09 and 0.40@xmath1100.09 respectively .",
    "because we are using only two line ratios to constrain , we again note that these estimates for  are lower limits , although as discussed above , they are not strong lower limits .",
    "we can compare our results to the estimated  for the magellanic clouds by @xcite , who adopted the dig luminosity for .",
    "they found  = 0.35 and 0.41 in the lmc and smc , respectively , which agree well with our estimates .",
    "table  [ tab : fesc_results ] gives the total , , and  for the hii  region populations listed in column 1 , with lmc and smc values shown on the left and right side of the table , respectively .",
    "the similarities in  between the two galaxies are not due to hi  distributions , which , as we saw above , differ strongly . instead , they apparently result from the brightest optically thin nebulae . in the lmc",
    ", 30 dor contributes nearly 60% of the total lmc escape luminosity .",
    "there is a similar situation in the smc , where n66 , ionized by the cluster ngc  346 , contributes an estimated 50% of the total escape luminosity in that galaxy .",
    "looking at figure  [ fig : cumfrac ] , the cumulative fractional  as a function of observed , we find that in the smc , only 30% of the escaping ionizing radiation comes from objects with @xmath111 . in the lmc , the contribution is near 10% for the same range of .",

    "previous studies estimated that @xmath11440% of the wim ( or dig ) ionization is due to isolated field stars , and optically thin hiiregions powered by clusters contribute the remaining 60% ( e.g. @xcite ) . from table  [",
    "tab : fesc_results ] , we find that  and  from the hii  regions alone is enough to balance the observed lmc dig recombination rate observed by @xcite , and that hii  regions account for 84% of the dig luminosity in the smc . including photometric errors , the dig of both galaxies can be powered by optically thin radiation from hii  regions alone .",
    "this is not at odds with the previous results when we consider that not all field stars are sitting naked in the dig .",
    "many are ionizing discrete nebulae , so that simply adding the ionizing luminosities of all field stars to  will overestimate its value .",
    "we have a unique opportunity to examine this quantitatively in the smc : the riots4 survey of @xcite is the only complete survey to target field massive stars in an external galaxy , and it includes 115 spectroscopically confirmed field o stars from the @xcite sample of field ob stars .",
    "of these smc field o stars , 60 show no associated nebular emission . using @xmath115 from @xcite to convert the stellar spectral types from @xcite , the total ionizing flux from these is equivalent to 12% of the dig ionization rate .",
    "there are an additional 27 stars whose location inside nebulae is ambiguous .",
    "if we assume their ionizing luminosity also streams into the dig , field o stars produce a total ionization rate equivalent to 23% of the dig .",
    "if we further assume no ionizing radiation escapes the galaxy , then the dig emission measured by @xcite reflects the combined ionizing radiation from field stars and from optically thin hii  regions , with 7788% of the ionizing radiation originating from hii  regions . using equation  [ eq : l_esc ]",
    ", an smc aggregate @xmath116 , instead of 0.40 ( table  [ tab : fesc_results ] ) , would result in hii  regions producing 7788% of the dig luminosity in table  [ tab : fesc_results ] , which is within our  uncertainty caused by photometry .      with ample evidence of the great distances that ionizing radiation travels from massive star forming regions , we can make an initial quantitative estimate of , the galactic escape fraction , by comparing the aggregate escape luminosities from equation  [ eq : l_esc ] to the dig luminosity @xmath117 , where @xmath118 the quantities needed to calculate  are listed in table  [ tab : fesc_results ] , where @xmath119 is the sum of observed @xmath120 and @xmath121 , as before .",
    "we see that in the smc , @xmath122 .",
    "however , as discussed above , this neglects the contribution from a known population of massive field stars . as calculated in ",
    "[ sec : itdig ] , the ionizing radiation from truly isolated stars in the smc is 12%  23% of the dig luminosity since about half of these field stars reside in hii  regions . in the smc , this yields a lower limit to  of 4%  9% . for the lmc ,",
    "table  [ tab : fesc_results ] shows that the ionizing luminosity escaping hii  regions is also about the same as the value needed to explain the lmc dig , without accounting for an unknown population of field o - stars .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the field star ionizing luminosity relative to hii  region @xmath102 is similar ( oey et al .",
    "2004 ) in the lmc and smc ( 0.05  0.11 ) .",
    "from table  [ tab : fesc_results ] and equation  [ eq : l_esc ] we find a lower limit to  in the lmc is 1117% .    it is important to bear in mind that our constraints on nebular  technically are lower limits , as stressed in  [ sec : method ] .",
    "the ranges in galactic escape fraction quoted above only reflect the uncertainties in the field star population .",
    "thus it is possible that  may be underestimated in one or both of the galaxies ; the crude estimates in table  [ tab : fesc_results ] preclude any conclusive results .",
    "future work is needed to quantitatively improve these constraints .",
    "further efforts may be directed at obtaining more definitive ionization - parameter mapping by adding imaging in more ions , or modeling diagnostic emission lines in filaments ionized by distant sources like those for 30 doradus and n66 , which can constrain the ionizing photon flux and sed of these dominant objects .",
    "we have demonstrated the power of spatially resolved , ionization - parameter mapping to quantitatively probe the optical depth of hii  regions to the lyman continuum .",
    "our cloudy photoionization simulations show that spatially resolved emission - line ratio mapping reveals the presence or absence of ionization stratification that diagnoses the optical depth of photoionized regions .",
    "the technique also constrains the optical depth in the line of sight .",
    "we show that ionization - parameter mapping in only  and  is a powerful and productive technique when studying global nebular properties .",
    "although there is a degeneracy between optically thin and weakly ionized regions when using only two radially varying ions , the technique works well in the aggregrate , and the degeneracy is resolved with observations of three sensitive ions .",
    "it may be possible to develop similar methods using emission from pahs , which are easily destroyed in ionized gas , and enhanced by non - ionizing uv light in ionization fronts .",
    "our application of ionization - parameter mapping uses the , , and  data of the lmc and smc from the mcels survey .",
    "first , we used /  ratio maps to define new boundaries for photoionized hii  regions .",
    "the /  maps reveal the nebular ionization structure , thereby allowing us to isolate the emission from individual photoionized hii  regions , even if they are overlapping and/or embedded in large complexes or bright dig .",
    "we used these data , together with the  surface brightness , to define the boundaries of 401 hii  regions in the lmc and 214 in the smc .",
    "the resulting hii  region luminosity functions are consistent with those published for these same galaxies @xcite , indicating that the simpler , -only boundary criteria do result in statistical properties that are similar to those for objects defined by our more physically motivated criteria .    based on their observed ionization structures ,",
    "the optical depths of the individual hii  regions were crudely divided into optically thin , optically thick , and blister classes . based on our models",
    ", we assign @xmath123 for the population of optically thin regions , 0.3 for blisters , and 0.0 for the optically thick objects .",
    "these estimates agree within 23% with more direct measurements of the optical depth for a sample of objects with known spectral classifications for the ionizing stars .",
    "these rough optical depth classes already yield fundamental new insights into the quantitative radiation transfer of the nebular population and dig ionization in these galaxies .",
    "we find that the frequency of optically thin nebulae is 40% in the lmc and 33% in the smc .",
    "the luminosity distributions reveal that the median luminosity of optically thin nebulae is significantly brighter than for those which are optically thick , by a factor of 2  5 .",
    "more importantly , the frequency of optically thin nebulae increases with , such that above @xmath124 , hii  regions in both galaxies are dominated by optically thin objects . due to their high luminosity and significant , these objects also dominate the total ionizing radiation leaking into the dig",
    ". it will be important to determine whether all star - forming galaxies show a similar luminosity threshold for the dominance of optically thin objects .",
    "we also see a correlation in the frequency of optically thick regions and hi  column density , with the median @xmath1  of optically thick nebulae 1.5 and 1.2 times higher than those of optically thin ones in in the lmc and smc , respectively .",
    "in contrast , the median @xmath1  of all objects measured in the smc is 2.4 times higher than in the lmc , probably owing to projection effects .",
    "it is surprising that despite major differences in the character of the ambient neutral ism outside of hii  regions , the quantitative properties of the lyc radiative transfer within the nebulae are remarkably similar between the two galaxies .",
    "this brings us to an important conclusion : the large - scale fate of ionizing radiation emitted by o - stars in the lmc and smc may be determined by the external , neutral hi  environment , which in the smc appears more efficient at trapping radiation once it escapes optically thin hii  regions ( e.g. the southwest region of the smc ) .",
    "optically thin nebulae are sufficiently luminous to maintain the ionization of the dig in both galaxies , as measured by @xcite .",
    "we also consider the global escape fraction of ionizing radiation from these galaxies into the igm .",
    "we find evidence that luminous , optically thin hii  regions near the outer edges of both galaxies may produce ionizing radiation that escapes into the interstellar environment .",
    "this is evidenced by the kpc - scale path lengths traveled by ionizing photons from these massive hii  regions , shown by the existence of extended  halos opening toward the igm .",
    "we find the combined , luminosity - weighted , lyc escape fractions from all hii  regions to be at least 0.42 and 0.40 in the lmc and smc , respectively .",
    "the corresponding escape luminosities are at least @xmath104 /@xmath125 and 39.2 in the lmc and smc , respectively . considering the existence of field o stars with no nebulae , the implied total available lyc luminosity is greater than needed to explain the dig emission in both galaxies .",
    "these are still crude estimates , but an excess implies that a fraction of the ionizing radiation produced leaves the galaxy and may enter the igm .",
    "we currently estimate lower limits to the galactic escape fractions of @xmath126 4  9% in the smc , and 11  17% in the lmc .",
    "these values are consistent with  @xmath11410%  20% , as required for cosmic reionization to be driven by star forming galaxies at high redshift @xcite .",
    "these estimates for  would increase when accounting for lower optical depth due to absence of dust and metals at high redshift .",

    "the code works in cartesian coordinates relative to the nebula with * z * parallel to the line of sight from observer to object .",
    "this geometry is defined at each @xmath127 coordinate ( projected on the sky ) by the minimum and maximum radial distance of the cloud along the line of sight @xmath128 .",
    "a specified physical geometry allows for the prediction of absolute nebular surface brightness . with the object - observer distance and 2-d spatial resolution @xmath129 and @xmath130",

    "a schematic of a cloudy simulation is shown in figure [ fig : surfbright]@xmath9 .",
    "the uneven spacing of shells around the ionizing star reflects the individual zones calculated within a cloudy simulation , which are set by changes in the physical conditions of the gas as a function of depth . the cloudy simulation calculates the isotropic volume emissivity @xmath131 of each emission line in each radial zone . at each @xmath127 coordinate",

    "our method of integrating the emission along the line of sight , from the far to near side of the hii  region , also allows us to include the effects of internal extinction , which is important for nebulae with a high observed column density , such as photodissociation regions and molecular clouds .",
    "computationally , we first determine the line flux entering a given shell , which is added to the diffuse flux in that shell .",
    "the sum is locally extinguished by the internal extinction in a shell calculated by cloudy scaled by @xmath139 , where @xmath140 is the shell thickness .",
    "this determines the flux entering the next shell along a line of sight toward the observer .",

    "the orientation , length and inclination of the slab are free parameters .",
    "whole and truncated spheres as in figure  [ fig : surfbright]@xmath10 are also possible . future support will include completely arbitrary geometric configurations .",
    "currently the code uses only one cloudy model to determine the emissivity as a function of * r*. later we will also add the ability to first define a geometry with initial density parameters and calculate the needed cloudy simulations from the specified geometry when predicting observations . this will make it possible to accurately model the emission from complex , irregular nebulae with different ionization parameters .",

    "<S> -this electronic version includes tables 5 and 6 as revised in the erratum- + - the erratum has been bundled as a separate file in this arxiv submission - + we exploit ionization - parameter mapping as a powerful tool to measure the optical depth of star - forming hii  regions . our simulations using the photoionization code cloudy and our new , surfbright surface brightness simulator demonstrate that this technique can directly diagnose most density - bounded , optically thin nebulae using spatially resolved emission line data . </S>",
    "<S> we apply this method to the large and small magellanic clouds , using the data from the magellanic clouds emission line survey . </S>",
    "<S> we generate new hii  region catalogs based on photoionization criteria set by the observed ionization structure in the /  ratio and surface brightness . </S>",
    "<S> the luminosity functions from these catalogs generally agree with those from -only surveys . </S>",
    "<S> we then use ionization - parameter mapping to crudely classify all the nebulae into optically thick vs optically thin categories , yielding fundamental new insights into lyman continuum radiation transfer . </S>",
    "<S> we find that in both galaxies , the frequency of optically thin objects correlates with  luminosity , and that the numbers of these objects dominate above @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the frequencies of optically thin objects are 40% and 33% in the lmc and smc , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the frequency of optically thick regions correlates with hi  column density , with optically thin objects dominating at the lowest @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the integrated escape luminosity of ionizing radiation is dominated by the largest regions , and corresponds to luminosity - weighted , ionizing escape fractions from the hii  region population of @xmath2 and @xmath3 0.40 in the lmc and smc , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these values correspond to global galactic escape fractions of 4% and 11% , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this is sufficient to power the ionization rate of the observed diffuse ionized gas in both galaxies . since our optical depth estimates tend to be underestimates , and also omit the contribution from field stars without nebulae , our results suggest the possibility of significant galactic escape fractions of lyman continuum radiation . </S>",
