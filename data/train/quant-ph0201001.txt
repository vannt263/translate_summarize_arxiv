    "brillouin and sommerfeld investigated the propagation of light pulse in a dispersive medium described by the lorentz model .",
    "they pointed out that in the region of anomalous dispersion the group velocity @xmath0 could be larger than @xmath1 , the light velocity in a vacuum , or even be negative @xcite .",
    "the anomalous dispersion occurs near the center of absorption lines . in the case of superluminal group velocities ( @xmath2 ) ,",
    "the transit time of the light envelope through the medium is shorter than that for a vacuum with the same length . in the case of negative group velocities ( @xmath3 ) ,",
    "the envelope leaves before it enters into the medium .",
    "chu and wong demonstrated experimentally that the light in a ga : n crystal can be propagated at such extraordinary group velocities @xcite . but in these kind of experiments it is inevitable that the shape of the light pulse is largely distorted due to the absorption .",
    "the standard definition of the group velocity , @xmath4 , which describes the velocity of the light envelope or peak , tends to lose its physical meaning under the strong distortion of the waveform .",
    "a new definition of group velocities , considering the reshape of the spectrum caused by the absorption , was proposed recently @xcite .",

    "_  realized anomalous dispersion without absorption using the gain - assisted linear anomalous dispersion , and demonstrated the light propagation at the negative group velocities @xcite .",
    "for the light pulse propagation in an absorption - free medium , the normal definition of the group velocity describes precisely the propagating speed of the waveform , or the envelope .",
    "the pulse propagation with superluminal or negative group velocities is very counterintuitive and is liable to cause many misunderstandings .",
    "however , it is the direct results of the interference of the wave and is consistent with the relativistic causality .",
    "the anomalous dispersion with no absorption induces phase shifts depending on the frequencies , thereby enhances the front part of the pulse by constructive interference and cancels the rear part by the destructive interference .",
    "the pulse shape is conserved if the phase shift is a linear function of the frequency .",
    "the interference does not occur only in the light propagation , but also in other wave or oscillation dynamics .",
    "signals in electrical circuits also interfere . in lumped systems",
    ", we can not define the group velocities , because there exists no finite length scale .",

    "the negative delays are closely connected to the superluminal or negative group velocities in spatially extended systems .     an electronic black box for negative delays .",
    "the input and the output are monitored by leds . when a pulse is fed to the input , the led at the output lights up before the led at the input . ]    in this paper , we propose a simple electronic circuit which generates negative group delays . while the dispersion relation @xmath5 of dispersive media determines the phase shifts in the light propagation , the transfer function @xmath6 of the circuit determines the phase shifts of the output in reference to the input .",
    "mitchell and chiao @xcite demonstrated negative delays in a bandpass filter circuit to which the carrier signal modulated with a pulse is applied .",
    "they showed that if the carrier frequency is located outside of the pass band , the envelope of the output pulse precedes the input . in practical implementation",
    ", a large inductor is required and it is replaced by a simulated inductor with operational amplifiers .",
    "the use of the carrier signal also increases the complication of the circuit .",
    "the circuit that we present here generates negative delays for baseband signals or signals with zero carrier frequency .",
    "it is easy to produce negative delays as large as a few seconds , therefore , we can observe it with the naked eye by watching two leds ( light emitting diodes ) each of which is driven by the input and output pulses .",
    "it is helpful and illuminating to translate fundamental physical concepts into a simple circuit which replicates the essence of the phenomena @xcite .    in the next section",

    "the discussion can be applied to both electric circuits and light propagation in a dispersive medium .",
    "a band - limited input signal @xmath9 can be expressed as a product of the carrier @xmath10 and the envelope @xmath11 ; @xmath12 , where @xmath13 represents the complex conjugate term .",

    "we will represent a circuit that satisfies the latter condition in the next section .    in order to translate the above discussion into the light propagation through a dispersive medium with length @xmath34 ,",
    "we suppose @xmath35 and @xmath36 represent the field of input and that of output of the medium , respectively . when the monochromatic light with frequency @xmath37 is propagated in the medium , the phase of the field is shifted as @xmath38 , where @xmath5 is the wavenumber in the medium . if @xmath5 is linear in the bandwidth , with the help of eq .",

    "if the difference between the propagation time of the envelopes in the dispersive medium and that in a vacuum with the same length @xmath34 is negative , i.e. , @xmath42 then the light propagation in the medium is called superluminal .",
    "there are two cases which satisfy this condition ; @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in the former case ,",
    "the output envelope precedes the output for the vacuum case but does not precede the input . in the latter case ,",

    "the pulse shapes , especially the widths of the pulses , are similar to each other owing to the same cut - off frequency , but the higher the order of filter the more the rising part is delayed . hence we need a high order filter to attain large time advance . in other words ,",
    "the pulse must be delayed appropriately in advance in order to get a large negative delay .    moreover the short - time behavior of the total circuit including the low - pass filters and the negative delay circuits is determined by the composite transfer function at high frequency ( @xmath90 ) .",
    "the order of the low - pass filter @xmath87 should not be smaller than the number of the stages @xmath8 of the negative delay circuits .",

    "it is so large that the input starts to rise when the output begins to fall .    a simulation result for multi - stage negative delay circuit ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "let us consider a positive delay circuit .",
    "a circuit called all - pass filter has the transfer function @xcite : @xmath95 the all - pass filter can be build with an operational amplifier , three resistors , and a capacitor .",
    "it is very convenient for generating positive delays for base - band signals because the amplitude and phase of the transfer functions are given as @xmath96 , and @xmath97 , respectively .",
    "the flat amplitude response allows us to cascade the @xmath8 circuits without introducing pulse distortion and results in the delay @xmath98 .",

    "the pole of @xmath101 , @xmath102 , is located in the right half plain .",
    "if one makes this circuit , it will be unstable owing to the time response function @xmath103 .",
    "this example tells us about the asymmetry between the negative delay and the positive delay .",
    "the former is much more difficult to achieve than the latter .",
    "the group velocity has no direct connection with the relativistic causality , therefore , it can exceed the speed of light @xmath1 in a vacuum .",
    "but the front velocity @xmath104 ( or the wavefront velocity ) is constrained by the causality and is equal to @xmath1 , namely , @xmath105 . in lumped systems ( @xmath106 ) , the wavefront delay @xmath107 must vanish .",
    "actually all of the pulses in our system have their wavefronts at @xmath64 , the moment when the original rectangular pulse rises or the switch is turned on .    to conclude",
    ", we demonstrated the negative group delay in a simple electronic circuit . a considerably large negative delay ( @xmath108 ) could easily be achieved .",
