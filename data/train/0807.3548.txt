    "the nature of dark energy ( de ) is one of the most intriguing questions facing physics .",
    "the fact that de provides the main contribution to the energy budget of the universe today while remaining subdominant during previous epochs , provides a challenge to model builders attempting to understand the nature of this seemingly all - pervasive ether - like substance .",
    "theoretical models for de include the famous cosmological constant , @xmath1 , suggested by einstein in 1917 @xcite and shown to be related to the vacuum energy @xmath7 several decades later @xcite .",
    "indeed , the cosmological constant appears to occupy a privileged position amongst other de models by virtue of the fact that its equation of state @xmath8 is lorentz invariant and so appears the same to any inertial observer .",
    "however , within the context of cosmology , an explanation of de in terms of @xmath1 faces one drawback , namely , in order for the universe to accelerate today the ratio of the energy density in the cosmological constant to that in radiation must have been very small at early times , for instance @xmath9 at the time of the electroweak phase transition . although vacuum energy may conceivably be associated with small numbers such as the neutrino mass ( @xmath10 ) or even the fine structure constant @xcite , a firm theoretical prediction for the value of @xmath1 is currently lacking , allowing room for alternatives including models in which both the de density and its equation of state ( eos ) evolve with time .",
    "alternatives to the cosmological constant include scalar field models called quintessence which have @xmath5 , as well as more exotic ` phantom ' models with @xmath4 .",
    "although most recent studies show that a cosmological constant + cold dark matter ( lcdm ) is in excellent agreement with observational data , dynamical dark energy can explain the data , too @xcite .",
    "indeed , the enormous variety of de models suggested in the literature ( see @xcite for reviews ) has been partially responsible for the burgeoning industry of model independent techniques aimed at reconstructing the properties of dark energy directly from observations @xcite .",
    "it is well known that model independent methods must be wary of several pitfalls which can subvert their efficacy .",
    "these relate to priors which are sometimes assumed about fundamental cosmological quantities such as the eos and the matter density . as first pointed out in @xcite , an incorrect prior for the eos can lead to gross misrepresentations of reality .",
    "the same applies to the value of the matter density .",
    "indeed , as we shall demonstrate later in this paper , an incorrect assumption about the value of @xmath11 can lead to dramatically incorrect conclusions being drawn about the nature of dark energy . clearly",
    "the need of the hour , then , is a diagnostic which is able to differentiate lcdm from ` something else ' with as few priors as possible being set on other cosmological parameters .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a new diagnostic , @xmath0 , which is constructed from the hubble parameter @xmath12 determined directly from observational data and provides a _ null test _ of the lcdm hypothesis .",
    "here @xmath13 is the scale factor of a friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology .",
    "we show that @xmath0 is able to distinguish dynamical de from the cosmological constant in a robust manner _ both with and without reference _ to the value of the matter density , which can be a significant source of uncertainty for cosmological reconstruction .",
    "the @xmath0 diagnostic is in many respects the logical companion to the statefinder @xmath14 @xcite ( otherwise dubbed jerk @xmath15 , see e.g. @xcite as well as the earlier paper @xcite ) .",
    "we remind the reader that @xmath16 for lcdm while @xmath17 for evolving de models .",
    "hence @xmath18 provides a _",
    "null test _ for the cosmological constant .",
    "similarly , the unevolving nature of @xmath2 in lcdm furnishes @xmath19 as a",
    "_ null test _ for the cosmological constant .",
    "( for null tests based on gravitational clustering see @xcite . ) like the statefinder , @xmath0 depends only upon the expansion history of our universe .",
    "however , while the statefinder @xmath20 involves the third derivative of the expansion factor @xmath13 , @xmath0 depends upon its _ first _ derivative only .",
    "therefore , as we demonstrate in this paper , @xmath0 is much easier to reconstruct from observations diagnostic does not use any information about the evolution of inhomogeneities in an frw background , usually represented by the growth factor @xmath21 . therefore our proposal for a null test of lcdm is totally unrelated to earlier null tests @xcite ( based on the analytical expression for @xmath22 in terms of @xmath23 obtained in @xcite ) , and to the test of physical nature of dark energy ( equivalently , that @xmath24 is a constant ) suggested in @xcite . ] .",
    "it is clear that a determination of @xmath25 from any single test may suffer from systematic uncertainties .",
    "that is why , in order to obtain @xmath0 with sufficient accuracy , it is necessary to combine information about @xmath25 obtained from different independent tests , such as the supernovae luminosity distance , the scale of baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) in the matter power spectrum as a function of @xmath26 , the acoustic scale in the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature fluctuations , etc .",
    "the second diagnostic  _ acceleration probe _",
    "@xmath6  is constructed out of the hubble parameter and the lookback time .",
    "like @xmath0 it does not depend upon the current value of the matter density .",
    "we apply @xmath6 to current data and show that it provides an independent test of the present acceleration of the universe .",
    "the plan of the rest of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "2 the @xmath0 diagnostic is introduced for a flat as well as a spatially curved frw background , and determined using snls and union supernovae data . in sec .",
    "3 the @xmath6 diagnostic is introduced . in sec .",
    "4 both these diagnostics are determined from a combination of existing data sets including type ia supernovae , bao and wmap5 cmb data .",
    "5 contains our conclusions .",
    "given many alternative models of dark energy it is useful to try and understand the properties of de in a model independent manner .",
    "an important model independent quantity is the expansion history , @xmath25 , whose value can be reconstructed from observations of the luminosity distance , @xmath27 , via a single differentiation @xcite [ eq : h ] h(z)=^-1  .",
    "the equation of state , @xmath28 , of de is more cumbersome to reconstruct since it involves two derivatives of @xmath29 and is therefore a noisier quantity than @xmath25 .",
    "an additional source of uncertainty relating to @xmath28 is caused by the fact that the value of the matter density , @xmath30 enters into the determination of @xmath28 explicitly , through the expression [ eq : state ] w(x ) = .",
    "clearly an uncertainty in @xmath11 propagates into the eos of dark energy even if @xmath25 has been reconstructed quite accurately .",
    "this fact has been emphasized in several papers @xcite and is illustrated in figure [ fig : eos ] , which shows how an erroneous estimate of @xmath11 adversely affects the reconstructed eos by making a lcdm model appear as if it were quintessence ( if @xmath31 ) or phantom ( if @xmath32 ) .    the influence of dark matter on dark energy persists if a parametric ansatz such as cpl @xcite w(z ) = w_0 + w_1 , [ eq : cpl ] is employed in the determination of h^2(z ) & = & h_0 ^ 2 ( 1+z)^3 + _ de , +   + _ de & = & ( 1- )  .",
    "[ eq : hubble_recon ] in this case , if @xmath11 is wrongly specified then , in a maximum likelyhood approach , the de parameters @xmath33 will adjust to make @xmath25 as close to its real value as possible , leading once more to an erroneous reconstruction of the cosmic equation of state .",
    "these two factors : the larger errors caused by the double differentiation of a noisy quantity ( @xmath27 ) and the strong dependence of @xmath28 on an uncertain quantity ( @xmath11 ) adversely impact the cosmological reconstruction of the eos making it difficult to differentiate a cosmological constant from evolving de from an analysis of @xmath28 alone .      in this paper we suggest an alternative route which enables us to distinguish lcdm from other de models without directly involving the cosmic eos . our starting point is the hubble parameter which is used to determine the @xmath0 diagnostic om(x ) ,   x=1+z  ,  h(x ) = h(x)/h_0  .",
    "[ eq : om ]    @xmath34 \\epsfxsize=3.2 in \\epsffile{omw09om27.ps } & \\epsfxsize=3.2 in \\epsffile{omw11om27.ps } \\\\",

    "we therefore conclude that : . in lcdm",
    ", this model contains scdm @xmath40 as an important limiting case .",
    "consequently the @xmath0 diagnostic can not distinguish between large and small values of the cosmological constant unless the value of the matter density is independently known .",
    "an identical degeneracy exists for the statefinder @xmath20 as discussed in @xcite . ] in other words , the @xmath0 diagnostic provides us with a _ null test _ of the cosmological constant .",
    "this is a simple consequence of the fact that @xmath41 plotted against @xmath42 results in a straight line for lcdm , whose slope is given by @xmath30 , as shown in figure [ fig : lcdm ] .",
    "for other de models the line describing @xmath43 is curved , since the equality = constant  , [ eq : slope ] ( which always holds for lcdm ) is satisfied in quintessence / phantom type models only at redshifts significantly greater than unity , when the effects of de on the expansion rate can safely be ignored . as a result",
    "the efficiency of the @xmath0 diagnostic improves at low @xmath44 precisely where there is likely to be an abundance of cosmological data in the coming years ! in practice , the construction of @xmath0 requires a knowledge of the hubble parameter , @xmath45 , which can be determined using a number of model independent approaches @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : om1 ] we show the @xmath0 diagnostic reconstructed from snap - quality data using the non - parametric prescription of @xcite .",
    "one clearly sees that for quintessence as well as phantom the line describing @xmath43 is curved , which helps distinguish these models from lcdm even if the value of the matter density is not accurately known .",
    "clearly , a comparison of @xmath0 at two different redshifts can lead to insights about the nature of de _ even if the value of @xmath30 is not accurately known_. thus , the two - point difference diagnostic om(x_1,x_2 ) om(x_1 ) - om(x_2 ) = ( 1-_0m)-  , [ eq : om12 ] can serve as a _",
    "null _ test of the cosmological constant hypothesis , since om(x_1 ) = om(x_2 )    ( -term )  .",
    "[ eq : lam ] in other words , @xmath46 for quintessence while @xmath47 for phantom ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath0 determined at two redshifts can help distinguish between de models _ without reference either to the matter density or @xmath49 _ !",
    "we have reconstructed the @xmath0 diagnostic and the cosmic eos for two sne data sets : snls @xcite and union @xcite .",
    "the snls ( supernova legacy survey ) dataset contains 115 type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) in the range @xmath50 the union dataset @xcite is a new compilation of sne ia and consists of 307 sne after selection cuts , includes the recent samples from the snls @xcite and essence surveys @xcite , older datasets , as well as the recently extended dataset of distant supernovae observed with hst @xcite .",
    "results for the snls dataset , shown in figure [ fig : om_snls ] , indicate that while the eos is quite sensitive to the value of the matter density , the @xmath0 diagnostic is not .",
    "note that the three distinct models of dark energy in figure [ fig : om_snls ] result in virtually the same luminosity distance since : ( i ) @xmath51 for @xmath52 ( phantom ) , ( ii ) @xmath53 for @xmath54 ( lcdm ) , ( iii ) @xmath55 for @xmath56 ( quintessence ) .",
    "this shows that different values of @xmath11 and @xmath28 can provide an excellent fit to the same set of data , as originally pointed out by @xcite . from the upper panel of figure [ fig : om_snls ]",
    "we find that the @xmath0 diagnostic is virtually independent of the input value of @xmath11 and its flat form is suggestive of lcdm .",
    ", its value in the upper left and right panels of figure [ fig : om_snls ] is not equal to @xmath11 .",
    "therefore from ( [ eq : om1 ] ) it follows that the best fit de model in these two cases is not lcdm .",
    "we conclude that although the behavior of om(z ) appears tantalizingly similar to what one would expect for the cosmological constant , the severe degeneracies between @xmath11 and @xmath57 prevent us from drawing a firm conclusion about the nature of dark energy on the basis of snls data alone . ]",
    "note that the degeneracy between evolving dark energy and the cosmological constant can be broken by studying the behavior of @xmath2 at higher redshifts . for most models",
    "the effect of de on expansion becomes negligible for @xmath58 leading to @xmath59 at moderately high redshifts .",
    "consequently the differential diagnostic @xmath60 evaluated at @xmath61 can help break the degeneracy caused by uncertainties in the value of @xmath11 . for the parameters in figure [ fig : om_snls ] , @xmath62 for the cosmological constant , while @xmath63 for evolving de ; see section [ sec : metamorph ] for a related discussion .",
    "figure [ fig : om_union ] shows results for the more recent union dataset .",
    "again we see that the behaviour of the eos can range from being quintessence - like ( for @xmath56 ) to being phantom - like ( for @xmath52 ) .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath0 is less sensitive to the value of the matter density and leads us to conclude that while a cosmological constant appears to be strongly preferred by snls , constraints from the union dataset allow evolving de as well as @xmath1",
    ".    one can improve the efficiency of the @xmath0 diagnostic ( [ eq : om12 ] ) by determining it selectively in regions where there is better quality data .",
    "the error in the reconstructed value of the hubble parameter is @xcite [ eq : tegmark ] ( z )  , where @xmath64 is the number of supernovae in a given redshift interval and @xmath65 is the noise of the data .",
    "since @xmath64 is never likely to be a perfectly uniform distribution , there will always be regions where @xmath64 is larger and @xmath25 better reconstructed .",
    "consequently , by determining @xmath60 selectively in such regions , one can improve the efficiency of this diagnostic by ` tuning it ' to the data .",
    "an important example of quintessence is provided by tracker de models , which give rise to cosmic acceleration at late times while earlier , during the radiation and matter dominated epochs , the density in the tracker remains proportional to the background matter density @xcite .",
    "this last property leads to @xmath66 at @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the background density of matter or radiation and @xmath69 is the redshift when tracking ends . as an example consider the double exponential model @xcite @xmath70 with @xmath71 , @xmath72 , which has the attractor solution @xmath73 , @xmath74 , at high redshift @xmath67 , while @xmath75 at the present time .",
    "since these models behave like quintessence at late times , their behavior is similar to that shown in figure 1 for a typical quintessence model .",
    "consequently these models may be distinguished from lcdm by applying the @xmath0 diagnostic shown in figure 1 .",
    "an interesting limiting case corresponds to _ metamorphosis _ models which have @xmath76 today and @xmath77 at earlier times @xcite . for such models @xmath78 for @xmath79 and @xmath80 , for @xmath81 where _ 0 m _ 0 m +  .",
    "consequently , the @xmath0 diagnostic applied to data at low and high redshift , may help distinguish between tracker de and lcdm as shown in figure [ fig : track ] .",
    "tracker behavior can also arise in modified gravity theories such as braneworld models @xcite and scalar - tensor cosmology @xcite .",
    "the growth of density perturbations provides a complementary means of distinguishing these models from lcdm .",
    "an important property of the @xmath0 diagnostic is that the value of the cosmological density parameter @xmath11 does not enter into its definition ( [ eq : om ] ) explicitly . as a result",
    "the diagnostic relation @xmath82 ( lcdm ) does not require an a - priori knowledge of the matter density and therefore provide a means of differentiating the cosmological constant from evolving de models even if uncertainties exist in the value of @xmath11 .",
    "( current observations suggest an uncertainty of at least 25@xmath83 in the value of @xmath11 @xcite . ) for a constant eos the dependence of @xmath0 on the value of the matter density can be altogether eliminated by constructing the ratio =  , [ eq : r ] from where we see that the eos encoded in the parameter @xmath84 can be determined from @xmath85 without any reference whatsoever to the value of @xmath11 !      the preceding analysis , which showed how the @xmath0 diagnostic could distinguish between alternative models of de ,",
    "was based on the assumption that the universe was spatially flat .",
    "while this may well be true with sufficient accuracy , especially within the framework of the inflationary scenario which predicts @xmath86 today ( due to the @xmath87 mode of primordial scalar fluctuations ) , let us now consider the case of small , but non - zero spatial curvature .",
    "then @xmath43 acquires the correction @xmath88 effectively , which has a fixed functional dependence on @xmath26 .",
    "so , @xmath89 and decreases with the growth of @xmath26 . for the interval @xmath90 at the @xmath91 cl admitted by the wmap5 results @xcite",
    ", this correction does not exceed @xmath92 ( or @xmath93 of the value of the @xmath0 itself ) .",
    "in this case ( [ eq : om12 ] ) is modified to om(x_1,x_2 ) = _ de -+ _ k -  , [ eq : om_curv ] and we assume @xmath94 as in figure 1 .    the influence of the curvature term can be estimated by a simple ` back of the envelope ' calculation which we carry out for quintessence ( q ) and phantom ( p ) .",
    "we assume @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 for q while @xmath99 for p. in the case of quintessence we find @xmath100 when the curvature term is included in ( [ eq : om_curv ] ) and @xmath101 when it is excluded .",
    "thus the inequality @xmath46 , which generically holds for quintessence models , appears to be quite robust , since the contribution ( read ` contamination ' ) from the curvature term is only a fraction ( @xmath102 ) of the ` signal ' from de .",
    "similar results are obtained for phantom : @xmath103 when the curvature term is included and @xmath104 when it is not . the presence of curvature leads , once more , to a @xmath102 change in our estimation of @xmath0 leading us to conclude that the phantom inequality @xmath47 is robust .",
    "( of course , as @xmath105 , the relative influence of curvature in ( [ eq : om_curv ] ) becomes significant and can dominate the ` signal ' from de models which are very close to lcdm ; see also @xcite . )",
    "in the previous section we showed how the difference between the value of the hubble parameter at nearby redshifts could be used to construct a null diagnostic for the lcdm model . in this section",
    "we construct another dimensionless quantity which could prove useful for determining the onset of cosmic acceleration in de models which has also been the focus of other recent studies @xcite .    our diagnostic , _ acceleration probe _ , is the mean value of the deceleration parameter = _ t_2^t_1",
    "q(t ) dt  . since q(t ) = ( ) - 1  , it follows that _ acceleration probe _ can be written in the following simple form 1+|q = ( - ) [ eq : q1 ] where @xmath106 , and t_0-t(z ) = _ 0^z [ eq : q2 ] is the cosmic look - back time ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq : q1 ] ) expresses the mean deceleration parameter in terms of the look - back time and the value of the hubble parameter at two distinct redshifts . from expressions ( [ eq : q1 ] ) and ( [ eq : q2 ] ) we find that , like the @xmath0 diagnostic , the acceleration probe @xmath107 does not depend upon the value of @xmath22 and is , therefore , robust to uncertainties in the value of the matter density .    in figure",
    "[ fig : qbar ] we show @xmath6 obtained using union supernovae and the cpl ansatz .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath6 suggests @xmath108 for the redshift at which the universe began to accelerate .",
    "this result is independent of the value of the matter density .",
    "close to the acceleration redshift , @xmath109 , and one obtains a very simple relationship linking the look - back time with the hubble parameter t = -  , [ eq : q3 ] where @xmath110 and @xmath111 lie on ` either side ' of the acceleration redshift @xmath112 when @xmath113 .",
    "since both the look - back time and the hubble parameter can be reconstructed quite accurately ( see for instance @xcite ) , it follows that one might be able to obtain the redshift of the acceleration epoch in a model independent manner using ( [ eq : q3 ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the value of @xmath6 can also be obtained from an accurate determination of galactic ages . in this case",
    "we do not require a continuous form of @xmath25 to compute the look - back time .",
    "we simply subtract the galactic ages at two distinct redshifts bins to determine @xmath114 .",
    "the same information can also be used to derive @xmath25 @xcite since h(z ) = - , [ eq : age ] which is then used to determine @xmath6 .",
    "however at present errorbars in observed galactic ages are large and the number of data is small , so it is unlikely that this method will be useful for determining @xmath6 at this stage .",
    "in the nearby future , with better quality and quantity of data , @xmath6 can be used as a model independent probe of the acceleration of the universe using distinct and uncorrelated cosmological data .",
    "note that the acceleration epoch is quite sensitive to the underlying de model . for de with a constant equation of state 1+z_a = ( ) ^  , and so an accurate determination of @xmath112 using ( [ eq : q3 ] ) could provide useful insights into the nature of de .",
    "in this section we determine our two new diagnostics , @xmath0 and @xmath6 , from a combination of : ( i ) the union supernovae data set @xcite , ( ii ) data from baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) @xcite , ( iii ) wmap5 cmb data @xcite .",
    "acoustic oscillations in the photon - baryon plasma prior to recombination give rise to a peak in the correlation function of galaxies .",
