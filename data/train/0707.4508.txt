    "in recent years many works have investigated different kinds of transport phenomena in periodic dynamical systems having no external net force or bias ( the so - called ratchet effect ) @xcite .",
    "this interest is of fundamental character , but it is also motivated by the fact that many possible applications exist .",
    "for example , they can be useful to understand and develop rectifiers , pumps , particle separation devices , molecular switches , and transistors .",
    "also , there is great interest in biology , since the working principles of molecular motors can be explained in terms of ratchet mechanisms @xcite .",
    "finally , we would like to mention cold atoms and bose - einstein condensates as promising fields of application , thanks to recent developments of the techniques needed to manipulate them @xcite . in the following we will have in mind systems that present chaotic features , since ratchets generally behave this way @xcite .",
    "hence , methods from classical and quantum chaos become extremely useful .",
    "the explanation of the appearance of a net current , i.e. , average momentum different from zero , is one of the main topics of this research . in a classical context",
    ", this behavior can be understood in terms of broken symmetries .",
    "one of the most convincing points of view up to now , is that all symmetries of the system leading to momentum inversion ( i.e. , sign change ) should be broken in order to have a net directed current @xcite .",
    "this amounts to say that , being only a necessary condition , we can follow curie s principle , and assume that if the current is not forbidden by symmetries , then it should be present . in non - hamiltonian cases , the asymmetrization of a chaotic attractor leads to a net directed current @xcite . in hamiltonian systems",
    "the asymmetrization of a chaotic layer embedded in a mixed phase space , for example , has the same consequences for a set of initial conditions inside of it @xcite . in this case , a mixed dynamics is in general a necessary condition ( for a notable exception see @xcite ) .",
    "the vast majority of the previously mentioned papers were focused on the classical aspects , leaving the quantum side less explored .",
    "however , there has been several recent publications that deal with this part of the problem .",
    "these works regard both the experimental @xcite ( systems of cold atoms , mainly ) and the theoretical sides @xcite . in general the quantum versions share symmetry aspects with their classical counterparts ,",
    "showing the corresponding current .",
    "but sometimes the relation between symmetries and the generated current are less obvious in the quantum case .",
    "tunneling , for example , can modify the direction of the current @xcite .",
    "interference , in any of its forms , generates more complex behaviors @xcite .",
    "in fact , we will see that the quantum and classical behaviors can be very different .",
    "a remarkable situation appears in some cases , when one can find a net quantum current that does not have a classical counterpart .",
    "this was essentially studied in hamiltonian ( non dissipative ) systems .",
    "the first time this phenomenon was found was in the modified kicked rotor ( kr ) at quantum resonance ( i.e. , the usual kr with a second harmonic in the kick ) @xcite .",
    "this is a classically chaotic system where the time reversal symmetry changing the sign of the momentum is kept .",
    "later , in the case of the modified kicked harper model @xcite , the classical current was found to be exceedingly small in comparison with the quantum one . in all of these cases the current does not reach an asymptotic value , and in fact these systems were called quantum ratchet accelerators .",
    "we present here a different behavior by means of a modified multibaker map @xcite .",
    "this system models a particle evolving with free flights and collisions with fixed scatterers .",
    "we were able to find a _ finite asymptotic _",
    "current that is only present in the quantized version .",
    "this suggests a general method for obtaining _",
    "purely _ quantum ratchets ( no classical current ) , without unbounded acceleration .",
    "we propose this system as a model to study general quantum transport phenomena in the presence of asymmetries .",
    "the well known classical baker s transformation is an area - preserving map defined on the unit square phase - space ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "here we use an asymmetric version which divides the phase space into two regions with different areas and lyapunov exponents .",
    "the general form of this map can be written in terms of one parameter @xmath1 @xmath2 where we can recover the usual symmetrical case by setting @xmath3 .",
    "the geometric action of the map is represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : bakerasim ] ( top ) .",
    "the quantum version of the map is defined in a discrete @xmath4-dimensional hilbert space with @xmath5 in terms of the quantum fourier transform with antiperiodic boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "@xmath6 where the allowed values of @xmath7 are such that @xmath8 and @xmath9 are integer numbers .",
    "the same procedure can be done to obtain an entire family of asymmetric quantum baker maps ( qbms ) @xcite .    the classical multibaker map @xcite is defined in a two - dimensional lattice where the phase space at each lattice site is a unit square .",
    "the dynamics of the map is a combination of transport to neighboring cells and a local evolution within a cell .",
    "the map is defined as @xmath10 , where the baker term is the asymmetric baker map defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : bakerasimgeneral ] applied on each cell @xmath11 , and the transport term is defined as @xmath12 the geometric action of the multibaker map in the phase space of a lattice of squares is represented in fig . [",
    "fig : bakerasim ] ( bottom ) . while the baker s map is asymmetric",
    ", the transport term is unbiased as phase space volume is transported symmetrically , as can be clearly seen .",
    "notice that the transport is entirely due to translations and therefore there are no tunneling effects from cell to cell .",
    "this transformation is not biased neither in the @xmath13 nor in the @xmath14 coordinate ; the reason is that the baker transformation maps the unit square onto itself and the transport term is balanced , as previously explained .",
    "this is the equivalent to the zero average net force typical of the dynamical systems addressed in studies of directed transport @xcite . in what follows",
    "we will focus on the coarse grained current , that in the classical case is defined by @xmath15 in this expression @xmath16 is the average value of the cell position @xmath11 for a given ensemble of initial conditions , at a time @xmath17 .",
    "it is easy to see that this definition does not take care of the fluctuations inside of each cell .",
    "however , we underline that there is no bias , making this model completely general .    from the classical point of view , the presence or absence of an asymptotic current follows the general criteria specified in @xcite and depends on the symmetries that reverse the sign of the transport . here",
    "there are two such symmetries @xmath18 the first one maps @xmath19 to @xmath20 , and therefore is broken unless @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath21 is a time reversal symmetry and is preserved at all times .",
    "thus , according to the criteria of @xcite there can not be an asymptotic classical current for unbiased initial conditions .",
    "transient effects can be present for biased conditions but will die off very rapidly due to the exponential mixing property of the baker map .",
    "numerical calculations confirm this expectation ( see inset of fig .",
    "2(b ) and caption ) .",
    "the quantum multibaker map is the composition of a translation on the lattice site that depends on the value of the projectors acting on the right and left subspaces of the baker map at each cell @xcite .",
    "this can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the projectors and @xmath25 is a unitary translation operator acting on the lattice subspace @xmath26 ( with @xmath27 the basis set of the lattice ) .",
    "the discrete time propagation of an initial state @xmath28 is @xmath29 here we will focus on initial states localized in one site of the lattice @xmath30 .",
    "a word regarding the analogy with quantum walks is in order here .",
    "in fact , this system can be thought as the @xmath4-dimensional quantum baker map coupled to a quantum walker in an infinite dimensional lattice @xcite .",
    "the role of the _ quantum coin _ in the quantum walk is performed here by the quantum baker map .",
    "the fact that the _ coin _ is classically ergodic is however an important difference , and is a fundamental reason for having no classical current .",
    "= 8.3 cm    = 8.3 cm    the transport properties of the system can be computed with the coarse grained density of probabilities of the lattice .",
    "this distribution is obtained by tracing out the internal degrees of freedom inside each cell and projecting on the lattice basis .",
    "being @xmath31\\ ] ] the mean value of the coarse grained position and the quantum current become @xmath32    we now turn to analyze the current behavior of this system by means of numerical simulations .",
    "first , we point out that if we take a mixed superposition of centered eigenstates of momentum as the initial condition for the qbm , we find that there is no current ( @xmath33 ) for the symmetric case ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "this confirms the need to break the @xmath34 symmetry in order to have a net directed transport . throughout the following calculations we consider as initial condition the mixed state corresponding to the incoherent superposition of the two central momentum eigenstates , i.e. @xmath35    fig .",
    "2(a ) shows the coarse grained current as a function of time with hilbert space dimension @xmath36 .",
    "we have plotted the results corresponding to its maximum negative and positive asymptotic values , for which @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that @xmath33 rapidly reaches a stationary behavior ( at about @xmath40 ) with fluctuations centered around a finite non - zero value as it is illustrated by the smoothed current in fig .",
    "[ fig : jdet32 ] ( solid lines ) .",
    "this shows that no unbounded acceleration is present , so there is a rectification of transport rather than an effective force in this purely quantum ratchet .",
    "the classical current for analog initial conditions is also displayed , being zero at all times . in fig .",
    "2(b ) we show the probability distribution @xmath41 and its classical version .    in fig .",
    "3(a ) we can see the averaged ( asymptotic ) coarse grained current @xmath42 as a function of the hilbert space dimension @xmath4 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( in order to make this averages we have taken the values of the current from @xmath45 up to @xmath46 ) .",
    "these cases are those at which @xmath33 approximately reaches its maxima in absolute value ( positive and negative current , respectively ) .",
    "we observe a smooth dependence of this quantity on @xmath4 ( apart from small fluctuations ) , showing that the effect is generic .",
    "in fact , this situation is completely different from previous cases @xcite . in these",
    "works a purely quantum current was found only at resonant values of a modified kr .    in fig.[fig :",
    "jded](b ) we show the averaged current vs @xmath7 for different fixed values of @xmath4 with @xmath47 .",
    "we do not show values for @xmath48 since @xmath33 turns out to be an odd function of @xmath7 around @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "in fact , if we apply the symmetry transformation @xmath34 to eq .",
    "[ qevolution ] , and then trace out the internal degrees of freedom inside of each cell we obtain that @xmath51 for all @xmath17 .",
    "this result is valid for any initial @xmath52 symmetrical under @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , the symmetry of the current becomes clear ( details will be presented elsewhere @xcite ) . as a consequence",
    ", there is a simple way to obtain current inversion in our system .",
    "= 7.2 cm    = 7.2 cm",
    "in summary , we have found a finite asymptotic current in a modified and unbiased quantum multibaker map ; this current has no classical counterpart .",
    "moreover , we can invert its direction by exploiting a symmetry with respect to the @xmath34 transformation .",
    "this is much in the same spirit as the corresponding current inversions found in the literature @xcite .",
    "the behavior of our system is rather similar to what happens in quantum walks .",
    "different combinations of the initial states and/or the unitary operators associated to the quantum coin produce a different bias in the final distribution of probabilities @xcite .",
    "we believe that this property , that is of pure quantum origin is the reason for finding a net transport in our system .",
    "in fact , we think that the existence of a net current is due exclusively to interference effects which persists in the @xmath53 limit . to obtain the classical behavior , i.e. , a vanishing current",
    ", some noise has to be introduced , just as in the case of quantum walk @xcite .",
    "we underline that this is a completely different case than that explained in @xcite , where the quantum current appearance is explained by means of the desymmetrization of floquet states , fact that can be directly related to the corresponding classical properties of the system .",
    "a detailed study of this will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "finally , we consider that the features of this map can be exploited to design generic hamiltonian systems that behave in a similar way . in that case",
    ", there will be the possibility to implement them in cold atoms experiments .",
