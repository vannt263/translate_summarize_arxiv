    "the polarization properties of astronomical sources are interesting for a number of reasons .",
    "they can be used , for example , in determining the physical processes at work ; thermal sources are not polarized , whereas non - thermal sources may have a significant degree of polarization .",
    "the rotation measure of a source can be used to determine magnetic field strengths ; for example pulsar rotation measures are used to derive magnetic maps of the galaxy . however , the degree of polarization in astronomical sources is often small , particularly circular polarization , and so careful calibration is necessary before the results can be interpreted .",
    "recent papers on polarization calibration of radio telescopes include those by hamaker et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and britton ( 2000 ) .",
    "the hamaker et al .",
    "( 1996 ) paper lays down the mathematical foundations which are subsequently used by sault et al .",
    "( 1996 ) to construct a method for instrumental calibration of a radio interferometer .",
    "their method is routinely applied to data from the australia telescope compact array and incorporated in the software package miriad . in this paper , i will use the approach of hamaker et al .",
    "( 1996 ) to develop a method for calibration of single dish data .",
    "this method is particularly useful for observations of pulsars . in the final section of the paper",
    "i apply the method to observations of the pulsar psr j13596038 using the 20-cm multibeam receiver on the parkes radio telescope and discuss the results .",
    "following hamaker et al . ( 1996 ) i describe the propagation of an electromagnetic wave in the @xmath0 coordinate system by @xmath1 where the axis of propagation is the @xmath2 axis , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are complex .",
    "the coherency properties of the electric field can be expressed in @xmath5 coordinates by the coherency matrix ( born & wolf 1964 ) @xmath6 where the @xmath7 denotes the complex conjugate .",
    "the electromagnetic field is converted to electric voltage in the _ feed _ of a radio telescope which , in the case of linear feeds , consists of two input probes aligned along @xmath8 and @xmath9 . a correlator multiplies and averages these voltages to produce",
    "the voltage vectors @xmath10 generally , one is interested in the ( true ) stokes parameters , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 which in combination form the stokes vector @xmath15 .",
    "one can express @xmath15 in terms of the electric field vector , @xmath16 , by @xmath17    the propagation of the radiation from the astrophysical source of interest to the output from the correlator can be described in the following way ( hamaker et al .",
    "let the effects of faraday rotation ( both through the interstellar medium and the ionosphere ) and parallactic angle rotation be combined into the matrix @xmath18 .",
    "we let the matrix @xmath19 represent the feed response ( including gains , phases and leakage terms ) . hence the voltages at the two probes",
    "can be described by @xmath20 and the correlator voltage vector is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the kronecker ( or outer ) product ( hamaker et al .",
    "the rotation matrix , @xmath18 , and the feed response matrix , @xmath19 , are given by hamaker et al .",
    "( 1996 ) as @xmath23 where each of @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are complex terms .",
    "it is important to note that hamaker et al .",
    "( 1996 ) have shown that such a formalism does not involve any approximations , although often , as below , the matrices are then expanded only to first order .    in this formalism , however , unlike that of britton ( 2000 ) , there is no direct physical association of the variables @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 . @xmath24 and @xmath25 can be thought of as ` leakage ' terms ; they describe the leakage of the opposite polarization into either receptor .",
    "the real parts of @xmath26 and @xmath27 relate to the sensitivity of the two probes and the difference in the imaginary parts of @xmath26 and @xmath27 relates to the phase offset between the two channels ( often called ` instrumental phase ' for a pair of linear receptors ) . however , this is not strictly correct , as @xmath26 and @xmath27 also mixed with the leakage terms ( hamaker et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "expanding equation [ kron ] and ignoring ( for now ) the effects of rotation we thus obtain @xmath28 where the scaling factor 1/2 arises from the determinant of @xmath29 .",
    "multiplying the two 4x4 matrices together we arrive at @xmath30",
    "using equation [ huge ] above and defining the measured stokes parameters in the case of linear feeds by @xmath31 we can express the measured stokes parameters in terms of the true stokes parameters as follows : @xmath32 where all second order terms in @xmath24 and @xmath25 have been omitted .",
    "somewhat unconventionally i have defined each complex term above by e.g. @xmath33 rather than @xmath34 to simplify the notation .",
    "note that these parameters are assumed to be time - independent but will not , in general , be frequency independent . in a perfect system",
    "one has @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 and hence the measured stokes parameters are identically equal to the true stokes parameters ( ignoring the effects of rotation of stokes @xmath12 into @xmath13 along the line of sight ) .",
    "if the gains and instrumental phase have been solved for by some other method , as is often the case , ( e.g. through observations of a polarized calibration signal injected directly into the feed ) , then @xmath37 and @xmath38 and equation [ thelot ] simplifies to : @xmath39    we also note , as britton ( 2000 ) has done , that a relationship holds between the measured and true stokes parameters via @xmath40 where @xmath41 is time - invariant and is related to the determinant of the matrix in equation 11 .",
    "this expression , the so - called invariant interval , is not frequency - invariant however , as it depends on the ( frequency dependent ) terms in the @xmath19 matrix .",
    "britton s idea of using the invariant interval for timing purposes has been used to great effect by van straten et al .",
    "it is sometimes stated that performing a ( short ) observation , rotating the feed through 90and observing again and summing the two observations has the effect of cancelling the effect of the leakage parameters . however , this is not the case , even to first order .",
    "the effect of feed rotation effectively converts @xmath12 to @xmath42 and @xmath13 to @xmath43 . to sum the two observations one essentially averages the sum of the two values of @xmath44 and @xmath45 and averages the differences of the two @xmath46 and @xmath47 measurements .",
    "assuming the gains are correctly calibrated , then using equation [ simple ] above , one obtains : @xmath48 and the total linear polarization is thus @xmath49 these last two equations show that the measured stokes parameters are now a better approximation to the true stokes parameters than a single observation would yield .",
    "however , even though the error in @xmath44 and @xmath50 are likely to be small , the error in @xmath45 can potentially be large if @xmath14 is small and @xmath51 is significant .",
    "the error in the position angle of the linear polarization will be of order @xmath52 .",
    "a further potentially interesting measurement is to subtract @xmath45 from one observation with that from an observation where the feed is rotated through 90 . in this case one",
    "obtains @xmath53 if q is large , one can then obtain @xmath54 directly .",
    "it is often the case that a cal probe is included in the receiver package .",
    "this probe usually injects a signal between the two ( linear ) probes at an angle of 45to both .",
    "the cal thus has @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "imagine now that the two probes have identical gains and there is no instrumental rotation ( i.e. we can set @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) .",
    "then , if the leakage terms are present , observations of the cal will yield a signal @xmath57 the first two expressions look like gain difference between the two probes , and the presence of @xmath14 looks like instrumental rotation of @xmath13 into @xmath14 . hence , even though we started with a system with perfect gains and phases , we derive using equation [ simple ] : @xmath58 and hence the system looks impure !",
    "one then re - observes the cal ( or any other pure u signal ) with these terms in equation [ thelot ] and one obtains : @xmath59 this implies that one does not , in general , measure a pure @xmath13 signal in spite of the calibration procedure .",
    "the parkes radio telescope has receivers with linear feeds . however , many other telescopes have circular feed systems .",
    "to apply this method to receivers with circular feeds one needs to change the stokes vector @xmath15 to @xmath60 and equation 10 to read @xmath61 the algebra can then be worked through to obtain expressions for the measured stokes parameters in terms of the true parameters as in equation [ thelot ] .",
    "from equation [ thelot ] it can be seen there are 4 measured quantities ( the stokes parameters ) and a total of 12 unknowns .",
    "these 12 unknowns comprise the 4 leakage parameters ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) , the 4 gain terms ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) , the total intensity , linear and circular polarization of the source and an unknown angle @xmath70 which deals with rotation along the line of sight such that @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "this angle is made up of the intrinsic position angle of the source , the rotation measure through the interstellar medium and ionosphere , the parallactic angle and the feed angle(s ) with respect to some reference frame .",
    "of these angles , only the ionospheric rotation measure and the parallactic angle are time variable .",
    "unless some independent measurement can be made of the ionosphere , this introduces unwanted noise into the calibration matrices . ignoring this , rotating the feed relative to the sky ( for example as naturally occurs with a feed mounted on an alt - az telescope )",
    "can be used to determine the 12 unknowns .",
    "provided we have sufficient independent measurements of the stokes parameters at a variety of parallactic angles , we can , in principle , determine all the unknowns .",
    "sault et al .",
    "( 1996 ) show that observations of an unpolarized source will yield only 9 of the unknowns , but that observations of a strongly linearly polarized source can determine all 12 .",
    "pulsars make ideal sources for ( self-)calibration as they are generally highly linearly polarized and have a reasonable degree of circular polarization .",
    "furthermore , the polarization changes across the pulse profile and one can thus use the information in multiple phase bins at a given pointing to help solve for the unknowns .",
    "the main drawback to using pulsars as calibrators is that they scintillate which implies that the total intensity , @xmath11 , can vary significantly on timescales of order minutes .",
    "the fractional polarization is not affected by scintillation , however , and therefore to overcome this problem one is forced to normalise the measured stokes parameters by @xmath44 at the expense of being unable to measure the true value of @xmath11 .",
    "unfortunately this procedure introduces errors as , of course , @xmath44 is not equal to @xmath11 . in practice these errors will be small unless the source is highly polarized and @xmath73 is large .    a previous method for calibration of pulsar signals was given in the appendix of stinebring et al .",
    "( 1984 ) and is still in use ( e.g. weisberg et al .",
    "however , their method involves a number of simplifications and assumptions which , in my view , are incorrect in some cases and which are , in any case , no longer necessary to make .",
    "any least squares fitting algorithm can easily solve for 12 unknowns with @xmath74100 data points in a matter of seconds and the full equations should thus be used .",
    "data on psr j13596038 were collected on two separate occasions in july and novmeber 2000 .",
    "each observing session lasted approximately 10 days and we obtained 65 and 66 independent observations covering the whole parallactic angle range available ( approximately @xmath7594 ) .",
    "these data were taken using the 64-m parkes telescope using the centre beam of the multibeam receiver at a central observing frequency of 1318 mhz and with a total bandwidth of 128 mhz . at the start of the observing session observations",
    "were made of the flux calibrator hydra a to obtain the system equivalent flux density .",
    "then , a 90 sec observation of the cal signal was made followed immediately by a 3 min observation of the pulsar .",
    "the pulsar observation was calibrated for differential gain and phase in the two probes based on the results from the cal observation and flux calibrated from the observations of hydra a. pulse profiles were formed in each of @xmath44 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath45 with 256 phase - bins per profile and 8 frequency channels across the 128 mhz total bandwidth .",
    "@xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath45 were then normalised by @xmath44 .",
    "figure 1 shows the measured ( normalised ) stokes parameters as a function of parallatic angle from data taken in november 2000 from the peak of the pulse profile in one of the frequency channels centered at 1365 mhz .",
    "it can clearly be seen that the circular polarization , @xmath45 , varies significantly with parallactic angle and that the variations are in phase with the variations in @xmath46 .",
    "the deviation in @xmath45 is very large with a peak - to - peak amplitude of about 0.2 .",
    "the implication of this ( from equation [ simple ] ) is that @xmath76 is of this order , given that @xmath46 is about unity .",
    "it was shown in section 5 , that observations of the cal induces subsequent errors in the observed stokes parameters .",
    "these errors can be removed by ( re-)solving for the gains and phase terms ( although nominally the cal observations are used to set these ) using equation [ thelot ] . practically , however , i set @xmath77 and @xmath78 and leave them fixed ; @xmath67 and @xmath69 then measure the relative gain and phase differences between the two probes .",
    "i then used a least squares fitting algorithm ( in this case the levenberg - maquart method ; lmm ) to minimise the residuals of @xmath79 and solve for the 9 unknowns from equation [ thelot ] given the data ( remembering that @xmath44 is fixed at 1 , all the observed stokes parameters are normalised by @xmath44 and @xmath80 , @xmath81 ) .",
    "the result of the fitting is shown in the figure . at this particular frequency , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 . given this and the discussion in section 4",
    ", rotating the feed through 90and observing again still induces a leakage of i into v of order 7% , about the same size as the true v signal in many pulsars .",
    "as pointed out , an independent measurement of @xmath54 can be obtained in this way , and confirms the measurements derived above .    at this point ,",
    "all the parameters of the matrix form of equation 11 have effectively been determined .",
    "the true stokes parameters can then be obtained by multiplying the observed stokes parameters with the inversion of this matrix .",
    "this can be achieved with e.g. the numerical recipes routine lubksb .",
    "figure 2 shows the rotation measure of the pulsar as a function of parallactic angle prior to polarization calibration .",
    "there are clear systematics in the data with sinusoidal variations of @xmath7410 rad  m@xmath86 about a mean of 35 rad  m@xmath86 .",
    "these are due to the frequency dependency of the leakage terms @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "figure 3 shows the effects of the calibration .",
    "the mean rotation measure is now 16 rad  m@xmath86 and the systematic effects are largely absent .",
    "using the excellent hamaker et al .",
    "( 1996 ) paper as a mathematical foundation , i have derived the matrices linking the true stokes parameters to the observed stokes parameters for single dish observations .",
    "it is then a computationally trivial task to solve for the terms in this matrix by least squares minimisation and thus provide a polarization calibration of the feed and receiver system .",
    "i would like to thank m. kesteven for fruitful discussions and a careful reading of this manuscript and r. manchester for discussion on the calibration procedure used at parkes .",
