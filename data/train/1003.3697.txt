    "the fourier components of the velocity field are transformed back to the real space then , and further analyzed .",
    "another very important type of decomposition is the separation of velocity into the mhd waves : alfvn , slow and fast . in this paper",
    ", we use an extended mode based on a technique described in cl03 .",
    "the procedure of decomposition is performed in the fourier space by a simple projection of the velocity fourier components @xmath71 on the direction of the displacement vector for each mode ( see [ fig : separation ] ) .",
    "the directions of the displacement vectors @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 corresponding to the slow mode , fast and alfvn modes , respectively , are defined by their unit vectors @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the parallel and perpendicular to @xmath80 components of wave vector , respectively , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 is the angle between @xmath9 and @xmath80 , and @xmath84 is the azimuthal basis in the spherical polar coordinate system .",
    "the fourier components of each mode can be directly used to calculate spectra . for other measures , such as structure functions ,",
    "we transform them back to the real space .",
    "we extend the cl03 technique by introducing an additional step before the fourier separation , in which we decompose each component of the velocity field into orthogonal wavelets using discrete wavelet transform ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the sum in the equation is taken over all position indices .",
    "we use 12-tap daubechies wavelet as an analyzing function and fast discrete version of the wavelet transform @xcite , thus , as a result we obtain a finite number of wavelet coefficients . after the wavelet transform of the velocity we calculate the fourier representation of each wavelet coefficient and perform its individual separation into the mhd waves in the fourier space using the cl03 method and",

    "the final step is the inverse fourier transform all all wave components .",
    "this additional step allows for important extension of the cl03 method , namely , allows for the local definition of the mean magnetic field and density used to calculate @xmath92 and @xmath93 coefficients . since the individual wavelets are defined locally both in the real and fourier spaces , the averaging of the mean field and density is done only within the space of each wavelet .",
    "we can summarize the extended version of the mhd waves decomposition into the following steps :    1 .",
    "perform wavelet transform of all velocity components . 2 .",
    "iterate over all wavelet coefficients . 1 .   calculate fourier representation of the current wavelet .",
    "2 .   calculate the mean density and magnetic field within the space occupied by the wavelet .",

    "4 .   add the contribution from the separated wavelet to the fourier representation of the alfvn , slow and fast modes .",
    "perform the inverse fourier transform of the alfvn , slow and fast wave components .",
    "in order to obtain one - dimensional ( 1d ) spectra we first calculate fourier transform of a quantity and next multiply it by its conjunction .",
    "we can use this procedure because we used a fully periodic domain .",
    "the 3d spectra must be averaged or integrated over shells @xmath94 .",
    "we used a simple integration by summing all squared amplitudes at given shell . for each model",
    "we have collected data several time steps .",
    "we used them to increase the size of sample and to measure the time departures of the spectra from their mean profiles .",
    "we should note here , however , that the time averaging and standard deviations were calculated in log - log space . otherwise , we could result in taking logarithm of negative number , e.g. for ranges of @xmath14 where the power spectrum has very small values ( of order 10@xmath95 or less ) .    in figure",

    "the spectral index is close to @xmath100 . in the case of superalfvnic turbulence ,",
    "the indices do not change with @xmath99 as well , and all models show the same , close to @xmath101 , value of the spectral index at low wave numbers , which is reflection of the presence of shocks in the system . proceeding toward smaller scales",
    "we observe a bump with spectral index approaching @xmath100 which could be explained by the growing importance of the mean field at these scales and dominance of alfvn wave .",
    "the velocity fluctuations have comparable amplitudes for corresponding scales for all models .",
    "it means , that the strength of fluctuations at particular scale @xmath14 within the inertial range does not depend on @xmath99 .",
    "the total velocity field contains two components : solenoidal , which is equivalent to the incompressible part , and potential , which contains the compressible part of the field and the remaining part which is curl- and divergence - free . in table",
    "[ tab : energies ] we show the percentage contribution of each component to the total velocity field .",

    "it is about 3% in subsonic models and about 7% in supersonic models , which confirms a higher efficiency of the compression in the presence of supersonic flows .",
    "furthermore , the fraction also changes when we compare models with strong and weak magnetic fields . the velocity field , in the presence of a weak magnetic field , contains about 5% of the compressible part in the model with @xmath102 and even up to 16% in models with @xmath103 . the consequence of the presence of a strong magnetic field results in a reduction of the compressible part of the velocity field by a factor 2 .",

    "this is similar situation like for spectra of velocity field . for superalfvnic models we observe similar situation , however , since the mean field is weaker , the power spectra are shifted down to smaller amplitudes .",
    "the similarities in spectra between the alfvn mode and velocity field are due to the fact , that the alfvn mode constitutes the major part of the velocity field .",
    "the slow wave , however , constitutes also a substantial part of the velocity field . looking closer in the spectral indices for the slow mode plotted in figure  [ fig : spectra_waves ] we see that their values do not change significantly with @xmath99 when mean magnetic field is strong , although it is difficult to determine one spectral index do to changing profile of the spectrum with the wave number .",

    "the degree of anisotropy grows with the scale , and for the large scale structures it exceeds somewhat the gs95 anisotropy . in the case of a weak external magnetic field",
    "the degree of anisotropy is uniform over the whole range of scales , but also here we notice very good agreement with gs95 anisotropy .",
    "the compressible component of the velocity field behaves differently .",
    "for subafvnic turbulence it is almost perfectly isotropic and independent of the sonic mach number . in the superalfvnic turbulence , however , we see , that structure of subsonic potential field is isotropic on average , although there are relatively large time departures from the isotropy . on contrary ,",
    "in the case of supersonic turbulence , the structure of the potential field contains a higher amount of anisotropic structures and the degree of anisotropy aims to the gs95-law .    in figure [ fig : mode_anisotropy ]",
    "we show the anisotropy of structures for alfvn , slow and fast modes of velocity .",
    "the separation of the modes is performed with the respect of the local mean magnetic field .",
    "the first comparison of these plots shows , that the degree of anisotropy does not depend on the sonic mach number for the alfvn and slow modes .",
    "the anisotropy of fast mode , similarly to the case of the compressible part of the velocity , depends on the regime of sonic motions .",
    "if the fluid motions are subsonic the structures of the fast waves is more isotropic .",
    "when the fluid motions are supersonic , more structures become anisotropic .",
    "we should note here , that speaking about the anisotropy of structures we understand a mean anisotropy of all structures of the analyzed field .",
    "individual structures in the turbulence evolve and yield at different deformations resulting in a constant change of the degree of the anisotropy .",
    "in this situation , speaking about an anisotropy , we are relating to the mean dominant anisotropy of all structures in the system .",
    "the two remaining modes , the alfvn and slow , show very similar anisotropies to those observed in velocity and its incompressible part .",
    "we see that basically the degree of anisotropy of structures in these two modes is closer to gs95 .",
    "in addition , the presence of a strong magnetic field results in a much stronger bending of the curves in right plots of figure  [ fig : mode_anisotropy ] signifying changes of the anisotropy with the scale of the structure .",
    "the curves in plots for superalfvnic models are almost straight and independent of the values of @xmath124 .",
    "intermittency is an essential property of astrophysical fluids . as intermittency violates self - similarity of motions , it is impossible to naively extrapolate the properties of fluids obtained computationally with a relatively low resolution to the actual astrophysical situations . in astrophysics",
    "the intermittency affects turbulent heating , momentum transfer , interaction with cosmic rays , radio waves and many more essential processes .",
    "physical interpretation of intermittency started after the work by kolmogorov , but the first successful model was presented by @xcite .",
    "the scaling relations suggested by @xcite relate @xmath125 to the scaling of the velocity @xmath126 , the energy cascade rate @xmath127 , and the co - dimension of the dissipative structures @xmath128 : @xmath129 parameter @xmath128 is related to the dimension of the dissipative structures @xmath93 through relation @xmath130 @xcite . in hydrodynamical turbulence , according to the kolmogorov scaling , we have @xmath131 and @xmath132 . vortex filaments , which are one - dimensional structures , correspond to @xmath133 ( @xmath134 ) . in the mhd turbulence",
    "we also observe current sheets , which are two - dimensional dissipative structures and correspond to @xmath135 ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "for these two types of dissipative structures we obtain two different scaling relations ( substituting @xmath131 and @xmath132 ) : @xmath137 \\ \\mathrm{for } \\",
    "c=2   \\label{eqn : sl}\\ ] ] and @xmath138 relation ( [ eqn : sl ] ) is often called the she & lvque scaling @xcite , while relation ( [ eqn : mb ] ) , the mller - biskamp scaling @xcite .",
    "there are theoretical arguments against the model ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but so far the she & lvque scaling is the best for reproducing the intermittency of incompressible hydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "structure functions can be calculated with respect to the global or local reference frames . by the scaling exponents calculated in the global reference frame we understand the scaling exponents calculated from the structure functions averaged over all directions . in the local reference",
    "we distinguish between directions parallel and perpendicular to the local mean magnetic field . in this way",
    "we define the reference frame locally by the direction of the local magnetic field .",
    "in figures  [ fig : expons_parts ] and [ fig : expons_waves ] we show scaling exponents for the velocity and all its parts and waves calculated in the global reference frame . in the top left plot of figure",
    "[ fig : expons_parts ] we see that for the subalfvnic turbulence the scaling exponents of velocity follow the she - lvque ( s - l ) scaling with @xmath134 .",
    "supported by the theoretical considerations we can say that most of the dissipative structures are one - dimensional .",
    "even though the scalings are not perfectly independent of the value of @xmath99 , since we see somewhat lower values of @xmath139 for higher @xmath140 , the differences between these values for models with different sonic mach numbers are within their error bars , thus it is relatively difficult to state that the scalings are completely independent or only weakly dependent of the values of @xmath99 . looking in the corresponding plot for models with a weak magnetic field we clearly see that the spread of curves for different sonic mach numbers is much higher than in the previous case . for subsonic model",
    "the scaling exponents of velocity follow very well the theoretical curve defined by the s - l scaling with parameter @xmath93 corresponding to one - dimensional structures .",
    "the model with @xmath141 , however , follows perfectly the s - l scaling with @xmath136 corresponding to the two - dimensional dissipative structures .",
    "moreover , models with even higher values of the sonic mach number have the scaling exponents for @xmath142 somewhat below the s - l scaling with @xmath136 .",
    "these observations suggest that the scaling exponents of the velocity change with the sonic mach number but only in the case of weak magnetic field turbulence .",
    "the presence of a strong magnetic field significantly reduces these changes and preserves the generation of the dissipative structures of higher than one dimensions .",
    "after the decomposition of velocity into its incompressible and compressible parts we also calculate their scaling exponents . in the middle and right columns of figure  [ fig : expons_parts ]",
    "we show the incompressible and compressible parts of the velocity field , respectively . the incompressible part it strong .",
    "it constitutes most of the velocity field thus it is not surprising that its scaling exponents are very similar to those observed in velocity .",
    "this is true in the case of subalfvnic models , because all curves in the middle left plot in figure  [ fig : expons_parts ] are tightly covering the s - l scaling with @xmath134 .",
    "the similarity between the velocity and its solenoidal part is also confirmed in the case of superalfvnic models but only for subsonic case , when the role of shocks is strongly diminished .",
    "two supersonic models show exponents following a scaling more closer to the s - l one with @xmath134 , yet still with lower values for @xmath142 .",
    "the scalings of structure of the compressible part , shown in the right column of figure  [ fig : expons_parts ] , can not be compared to any of the theoretical models .",
    "their scalings signify dissipative structures with dimensions higher than two , but the theory may be not applicable here . in order to explain what these scaling exponents represent we should describe what could be a physical picture of the compressible part of the velocity field .",
    "first of all , the compressible part is much weaker then the incompressible one , thus the structure functions of higher orders amplify rare events in the structure , such as individual regions compressed by shocks .",
    "this is supported by the huge error bars increasing with the value of @xmath140 signifying that these rare events may have poor statistics or can change rapidly contributing differently at different times and in different models .",
    "in such situations the scaling exponents for higher values of @xmath140 are not reliable .",
    "another decomposition , which separate velocity into the mhd waves , gives an opportunity to calculate their scaling relations as well . in figure",
    "[ fig : expons_waves ] we present the scaling exponents for the alfvn , slow and fast waves .",
    "the alfvn wave is presented in plots in the left column . comparing these plots with the corresponding plots for the solenoidal part of the velocity reveals obvious conclusion that the alfven wave due to its incompressibility should follow exactly the same scaling as the incompressible part .",
    "this is visible in these two plots clearly .",
    "scaling exponents of the solenoidal part and the alfvn mode match nicely in plots for subalfvnic models with a weaker dependency of the sonic mach number and for superalfvnic models where the dependency of @xmath99 is stronger .",
    "two other modes , the slow and fast waves presented in the middle and right columns of figure  [ fig : expons_waves ] , respectively , show similar scaling relations .",
    "for example , the scaling exponents for slow and fast waves in the subalfvnic turbulence follow the s - l scaling with @xmath136 and depend on the sonic mach number marginally .",
    "this signifies that the two - dimensional structures dominate in both components . for superalfvnic turbulence",
    "the scalings of these two waves show a somewhat different situation . both components , the slow and fast waves , have similar values of scaling exponents @xmath139 , but they change with the sonic mach number .",
    "we see that for subsonic turbulence most of dissipative structures of the slow and fast waves is one - dimensional .",
    "scaling exponents follow very precisely the s - l scaling with @xmath134 . in the case of supersonic turbulence , however , these scalings suggest the two - dimensional dissipative structures again , similarly to the subalfvnic turbulence .",
    "this signifies an important role of the magnetic field in the generation of the structures of different dimensions in the subsonic turbulence .",
    "the above considerations were carried for the scalings relations in the global reference frame , i.e. , when we do not take the direction of the local magnetic field into account .",
    "the strong magnetic field is dynamically important in subalfvnic turbulence and can greatly influence the generation of the structure , thus the statistical methods which include also its local direction in the analysis can give a substantial insight into the physics of turbulence with the presence of the magnetic field . in figure",
    "[ fig : expons_parts_local ] we show scaling exponents calculated in the local reference frame for velocity and its incompressible and compressible parts . starting from the subalfvnic turbulence , which are shown on two upper rows ( for parallel and perpendicular directions , respectively ) , we see that the scaling exponents are different depending on the direction .",
    "for example , the structures of velocity in the direction perpendicular to the local field are one - dimensional , as suggested by the plot in the second row on the left in figure  [ fig : expons_parts_local ] .",
    "this scalings are very similar to those calculated in the global reference frame .",
    "however , the same velocity field in the direction along the local magnetic field have different structures with higher dimensions than two , according to the corresponding plots .",
    "both scalings , in parallel and perpendicular directions , depend on the sonic mach number only marginally .",
    "next , the solenoidal component shown in the middle column of figure  [ fig : expons_parts_local ] have a similar property .",
    "its structures in the perpendicular direction are very similar to that observed in the global reference frame while in the parallel direction its structures are two - dimensional .",
    "again , the potential component , although its scaling relation can not be explained by the current theoretical models , have scaling relations in the perpendicular direction very similar to that in the global reference frame .",
    "all these observations signify that the dominant structures are created in the directions perpendicular to the local field , while the parallel structures are less significant and usually have more dimensions .",
    "we see that in these models the role of the magnetic field in generation of the structure is very clear .",
    "what do we expect when the magnetic field is weaker in such turbulence .",
    "now , we compare the scaling exponents of mhd waves obtained in the local reference frame which are presented in figure  [ fig : expons_waves_local ] .",
    "the alfvn wave which is incompressible and directed perpendicularly to the local magnetic field is presented in the left column of figure  [ fig : expons_waves_local ] . in the subalfvnic turbulence when the magnetic field is strong",
    "we expect that the most of the structure of the alfvn mode should be generated in the direction perpendicular to the local magnetic field .",
    "this is confirmed by the corresponding plots in figure  [ fig : expons_waves_local ] .",
    "the scaling exponents in the perpendicular direction are consistent with those in the global reference frame ( figure  [ fig : expons_waves ] ) .",
    "the scalings suggest the one - dimensional dissipative structures in all subalfvnic models independently of the sonic mach number . in the parallel direction",
    "the plot suggests the dissipative structures with higher direction but at the same time we see very large error bars which signify very poor statistics .",
    "it means that the structures of the alfvn wave created in the direction parallel to the local field are marginal . on the contrary",
    ", the slow wave has direction parallel to the local mean magnetic field , what signifies that its dissipative structure should be more dominant in the parallel direction .",
    "indeed , the slow wave in the parallel direction has structures consistent with those observed in the global mean magnetic field while in the perpendicular direction it shows some random , rare events in the structure .",
    "in the paper we have introduced a new procedure of decomposition of mhd turbulence field into alfvn , slow and fast modes which uses wavelets . compared to the decomposition procedure based on fourier transforms",
    "described in cl03 , the wavelet decomposition is more local , thus it follows better the local magnetic field direction in respect to which the decomposition into modes takes place . as a result",
    ", we expect that the wavelet decomposition procedure to be more accurate for larger amplitudes of turbulence , i.e. larger perturbations of magnetic field .",
    "our decomposition of the mhd turbulence confirmed the results in cl03 in terms of spectra , namely , that the alfvnic and slow modes are anisotropic and consistent with the predictions of the gl95 model of incompressible turbulence , while the fast modes are mostly isotropic and form an acoustic turbulence cascade @xcite .",
    "as these results were used in studies of cosmic ray scattering and acceleration @xcite as well as charged dust acceleration @xcite this is an encouraging development .    at the same time , the intermittency of the different mhd modes were shown to be very different .",
    "we clearly see the dependence of high order statistics of compressible motions on the mach number .",
    "we interpret this dependence as the result of shock formation , which eventually changes the nature of the compressible motion cascade compared to the cl03 assumptions .",
    "the limitations of the present study arise from the yet unclear nature of the turbulent cascade .",
    "for instance , it was shown in @xcite that the degree of locality of interactions in hydrodynamic and mhd cascade are different .",
    "thus even largest available mhd simulations may not present the actual inertial range of the cascade , but the measured slope may be strongly affected by the extended bottle - neck effect of the simulations .",
    "in addition , the limited range over which alfvenic turbulence is weak may exhibit a rather different scaling of fast modes as a result of the interactions of the alfvenic and fast modes @xcite .",
    "in addition , within the present study we intentionally do not consider the scaling of magnetic perturbations . the velocity and magnetic perturbations for subalfvenic turbulence show some differences , which are rather difficult to study reliably with the available numerical simulations .",
    "these differences are not a part of the gs95 picture , but may reflect additional yet unclear properties of the mhd cascade ( see * ? ? ?",
    "in our study we used only the incompressible driving . in the presence of the compressible supersonic driving @xcite the scaling looks different , but the existence of the inertial range is then questionable .",
    "@xcite claimed that combining the compressible and incompressible driving in the mach number dependent fashion one can obtain a better power - law inertial range .",
    "this issue requires further studies .",
    "the turbulence driving in our study is balanced , in the sense that the energy flows in opposite directions are equal . in the presence of sources and sinks of turbulent energy , astrophysical turbulence",
    "is expected to be imbalanced .",
    "our numerical studies of imbalanced turbulence in @xcite show that the properties of alfvenic turbulence changes substantially in the presence of imbalance .",
    "however , the degree of sustainable imbalance in compressible turbulence is still unclear .",
    "one expects the density fluctuation in turbulent fluid to reflect the incoming waves , altering the imbalance .",
    "we believe that in high mach number fluids the imbalance is low due to the existence of substantial density contrasts .",
    "depending on driving astrophysical turbulence may be subalfvnic , if the injection velocity @xmath143 is less than alfven speed @xmath144 , alfvenic , if @xmath145 , and superalfvenic , if @xmath146 .",
    "this frequently is also described by the alfven mach number @xmath147 .",
    "formally , the gs95 model applies only to incompressible motions with @xmath145 , or equivalently @xmath148 .",
    "some of the astrophysical applications of the model , indeed , use the original form of the theory , which substantially limits the applications of the theory ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the model can be easily generalized to cover extensive ranges of superalfvenic and subalfvenic turbulence ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for subalfvenic turbulence with isotropic driving at the scale @xmath13 an initial weak cascade , in which the parallel scale of motions stays the same and the spectrum @xmath149 is applicable , transfers to the regime of strong turbulence at the scale of @xmath150 , for which the gs95 critical balance arguments are applicable . for superalfvenic turbulence ,",
    "while up to the scale @xmath151 the turbulence is hydrodynamic , it approaches the gs95-type regime for smaller scales .",
    "therefore , the relations obtained for mhd turbulence that we have studied above can be generalized for cases of different intensity of driving .    while the gs95 model is a model of incompressible turbulence , our simulations confirm the numerical findings in @xcite and cl03 that the scaling of the alfvenic mode in the compressible turbulence is very similar to its scaling in the incompressible case .",
    "in particular , the gs95 anisotropy of mhd turbulence determines the rate of magnetic field wandering which is important for many astrophysical processes , including the ubiquitous process of magnetic reconnection @xcite .",
    "additional implications of magnetic field wandering include the diffusion of heat and cosmic rays , mhd acceleration of dust etc .",

    "a small and transient volume with high temperatures or violent turbulence can have significant effects on the net rates of processes within the ism .",
    "for instance , many interstellar chemical reactions ( e.g. , the strongly endothermic formation of ch@xmath152 ) might take place within very intensive intermittent vortices .",
    "the aforementioned authors claimed the existence of the observational evidence for such reactions and heating , but a more quantitative approach to the problem is possible .",
    "@xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "so they used the fact that @xcite model of intermittency corresponds generalized log - poisson distribution of the local dissipation rates @xcite .",
    "the obtained rates of enhancement were not sufficient to explain the heating required for inducing interstellar chemistry @xcite .",
    "the same approach was used by @xcite who obtained , however , a different result .",
    "we believe that one should distinguish shocks from vortical motions while calculating the heating induced by intermittency .",
    "our present study show very different scalings relevant to these types of motions .",
    "numerous studies of compressible mhd turbulence are done in the context of star formation ( see reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "most of these simulations are focused on the large - scale appearances of the turbulence , which is determined by the turbulent driving and do not exhibit any extended inertial range of turbulence .",
    "search for the universal relations for compressible turbulence resulted in the rise of interest to the @xcite idea of searching universality not for velocity , but for the combination of the velocity and density in the form @xmath153 .",
    "the numerical study of hydrodynamic compressible turbulence revealed that , indeed , the density modified velocity shows the same kolmogorov scaling both for low and high mach number turbulence @xcite .",
    "similar effect was confirmed in our mhd simulations @xcite .",
    "however , the physical justification of this universality is unclear and it may result just from the coincidental compensation of the change of velocity and density indexes as shocks develop at high mach number turbulence .",
    "we report steepening of the spectra of compressible motions at high mach numbers .",
    "high resolution hydro simulations ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the application of these techniques should enhance the range of astrophysical turbulent velocity fields that can be studied observationally it is comparing numerics , observations and theory that the progress in understanding of turbulence requires .",
    "in this article we presented a new technique of decomposition of turbulent mhd motions into alfven , slow and fast modes .",
    "the technique is based on the use of wavelets , which provide a more local decomposition compared to the fourier approach in cl02 and cl03 .",
    "this enables one to have better accuracy of the decomposition of mhd turbulence into fundamental modes for higher amplitude of magnetic perturbations .    by applying the wavelet decomposition to the results of our simulations of compressible mhd turbulence , we investigated the scaling properties of velocity in compressible mhd turbulence for different sonic @xmath154 and alfvnic @xmath155 mach numbers .",

    "<S> we study compressible mhd turbulence , which holds key to many astrophysical processes , including star formation and cosmic ray propagation . to account for the variations of the magnetic field in the strongly turbulent fluid we use wavelet decomposition of the turbulent velocity field into alfvn , slow and fast modes , which presents an extension of the cho & lazarian ( 2003 ) decomposition approach based on fourier transforms . </S>",
    "<S> the wavelets allow to follow the variations of the local direction of magnetic field and therefore improve the quality of the decomposition compared to the fourier transforms which are done in the mean field reference frame . for each resulting component </S>",
    "<S> we calculate spectra and two - point statistics such as longitudinal and transverse structure functions , as well as , higher order intermittency statistics . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we perform the helmholtz - hodge decomposition of the velocity field into the incompressible and compressible parts and analyze these components . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the turbulence intermittency is different for different components and we show that the intermittency statistics depend on whether the phenomenon was studied in the global reference frame related to the mean magnetic field or it was studied in the frame defined by the local magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the dependencies of the measures we obtained are different for different components of velocity , for instance , we show that while the alfvn mode intermittency changes marginally with the mach number the intermittency of the fast mode is substantially affected by the change . </S>"
