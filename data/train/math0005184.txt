    "note that the quasi - isometry type of a metric space @xmath8 is unchanged upon removal of any bounded subset of @xmath8 ; hence the term `` asymptotic '' .",

    "in particular :    the word metric on any f.g .",
    "group is unique up to quasi - isometry .",
    "any injective homomorphism with finite index image is a quasi - isometry , as is any surjective homomorphism with finite kernel .",
    "the equivalence relation generated by these two types of maps can be described more compactly : two groups @xmath10 are equivalent in this manner if and only if they are _ weakly commensurable _ , which means that there exists a group @xmath11 and homomorphisms @xmath12 , @xmath13 each having finite kernel and finite index image ( proof : show that `` weakly commensurable '' is in fact an equivalence relation ) .",
    "this weakens the usual notion of _ commensurability _ , i.e.  when @xmath0 and @xmath14 have isomorphic finite index subgroups .",
    "weakly commensurable groups are clearly quasi - isometric .",
    "any two cocompact , discrete subgroups of a lie group are quasi - isometric .",
    "there are cocompact discrete subgroups of the same lie group which are not weakly commensurable , for example arithmetic lattices are not weakly commensurable to non - arithmetic ones .",
    "the polynomial growth theorem was an important motivation for gromov when he initiated in @xcite the problem of classifying finitely - generated groups up to quasi - isometry .",
    "theorem [ theorem : polynomial : growth ] , together with the fact that nilpotent groups have polynomial growth ( see  [ section : nilpotent ] below ) , implies that the property of being nilpotent is actually an asymptotic property of groups .",
    "more precisely , the class of nilpotent groups is _ quasi - isometrically rigid _ : any finitely - generated group quasi - isometric to a nilpotent group is weakly commensurable to some nilpotent group .",
    "sometimes this is expressed by saying that the property of being nilpotent is a _ geometric property _ , i.e.  it is a quasi - isometry invariant ( up to weak commensurability ) .",

    "groups up to quasi - isometry .",
    "as we shall see , the classification problem is usually much more delicate than the rigidity problem ; indeed the quasi - isometry classification of finitely - generated nilpotent groups remains one of the major open problems in the field .",
    "we discuss this in greater detail in  [ section : nilpotent ] .",
    "the corresponding rigidity and classification problems for irreducible lattices in semisimple lie groups have been completely solved .",
    "this is a vast result due to many people and , among other things , it generalizes and strengthens the mostow rigidity theorem .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for a survey of this work .",
    "in contrast , results for finitely generated solvable groups have remained more elusive .",
    "there are several reasons for this :    finitely generated solvable groups are defined algebraically , and so they do not always come equipped with an obvious or well - studied geometric model ( see , e.g. , item 3 below ) .",
    "dioubina s examples show not only that the class of finitely - generated solvable groups is not quasi - isometrically rigid ; they also show ( see  [ section : abc ] below ) that the answer to question [ question : rigidity ] for certain subclasses of solvable groups ( e.g.  abelian - by - cyclic ) differs in the finitely presented and finitely generated cases .",

    ", our understanding of the geometry of finitely - generated solvable groups is quite limited . in ",
    "[ section : nilpotent ] we discuss what is known about the quasi - isometry classification of nilpotent groups ( the rigidity being given by gromov s polynomial growth theorem ) . beyond nilpotent groups , the only detailed knowledge we have is for the finitely - presented , nonpolycyclic abelian - by - cyclic groups .",
    "we discuss this in depth in ",
    "[ section : abc ] , and give a conjectural picture of the polycyclic case in  [ section : abc2 ] .",
    "one of the interesting discoveries described in these sections is a connection between finitely presented solvable groups and the theory of dynamical systems .",
    "this connection is pursued very briefly in a more general context in ",
    "[ section : final ] , together with some questions about issues beyond the limits of current knowledge .",

    "it therefore contains neither an exhaustive history nor detailed proofs ; for these the reader may consult the references .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank david fisher , pierre de la harpe , ashley reiter , jennifer taback , and the referee for their comments and corrections .",
    "recall that the _ wreath product _ of groups @xmath22 and @xmath23 , denoted @xmath24 , is the semidirect product @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the direct sum of copies of b indexed by elements of a , and a acts via the `` shift '' , i.e.  the left action of @xmath22 on the index set @xmath22 via left multiplication . note that if @xmath22 and @xmath23 are finitely - generated then so is @xmath24 .",
    "the main result of dioubina @xcite is that , if there is a bijective quasi - isometry between finitely - generated groups @xmath22 and @xmath23 , then for any finitely - generated group @xmath27 the groups @xmath28 and @xmath29 are quasi - isometric .",
    "dioubina then applies this theorem to the groups @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a finite nonsolvable group .",
    "it is easy to construct a one - to - one quasi - isometry between @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",

    "hence the class of finitely - generated solvable groups is not quasi - isometrically rigid .",
    "dioubina s examples never have any finite presentation .",
    "in fact if @xmath24 is finitely presented then either @xmath22 or @xmath23 is finite ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this leads to the following question .",
    "is the class of finitely presented solvable groups quasi - isometrically rigid ?",
    "note that the property of being finitely presented is a quasi - isometry invariant ( see @xcite ) .",
    "while the polynomial growth theorem shows that the class of finitely generated nilpotent groups is quasi - isometrically rigid , the following remains an important open problem .",
    "classify finitely generated nilpotent groups up to quasi - isometry .",
    "the basic quasi - isometry invariants for a finitely - generated nilpotent group @xmath0 are most easily computed in terms of the set @xmath38 of ranks ( over @xmath39 ) of the quotients @xmath40 of the lower central series for @xmath0 , where @xmath41 is defined inductively by @xmath42 and @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "one of the first quasi - isometry invariants to be studied was the growth of a group , studied by dixmier , guivarch , milnor , wolf , and others ( see @xcite , chapters vi - vii for a nice discussion of this , and a careful account of the history ) .",
    "the _ growth _ of @xmath0 is the function of @xmath44 that counts the number of elements in a ball of radius @xmath44 in @xmath0 .",
    "there is an important dichotomy for solvable groups :    let @xmath0 be a finitely generated solvable group .",
    "then either @xmath0 has polynomial growth and is virtually nilpotent , or @xmath0 has exponential growth and is not virtually nilpotent .",
    "when @xmath0 has polynomial growth , the degree @xmath45 of this polynomial is easily seen to be a quasi - isometry invariant .",
    "it is given by the following formula , discovered around the same time by guivarch @xcite and by bass @xcite : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the degree of nilpotency of @xmath0 .",
    "another basic invariant is that of virtual cohomological dimension @xmath48 . for groups @xmath0 with finite classifying space ( which is not difficult to check for torsion - free nilpotent groups )",
    ", this number was shown by gersten @xcite and block - weinberger @xcite to be a quasi - isometry invariant .",
    "on the other hand it is easy to check that @xmath49 where @xmath47 is the degree of nilpotency , also known as the hirsch length , of @xmath0 . as bridson and gersten",
    "have shown ( see @xcite ) , the above two formulas imply that any finitely generated group @xmath15 which is quasi - isometric to @xmath50 must have a finite index @xmath50 subgroup : by the polynomial growth theorem such a @xmath15 has a finite index nilpotent subgroup @xmath51 ; but @xmath52 and so @xmath53 which can only happen if @xmath54 for @xmath55 , in which case @xmath51 is abelian .",
    "give an elementary proof ( i.e. without using gromov s polynomial growth theorem ) that any finitely generated group quasi - isometric to @xmath50 has a finite index @xmath50 subgroup .",
    "as an exercise , the reader is invited to find nilpotent groups @xmath56 which are not quasi - isometric but which have the same degree of growth and the same @xmath57 .",
    "there are many other quasi - isometry invariants for finitely - generated nilpotent groups @xmath15 .",
    "all known invariants are special cases of the following theorem of pansu @xcite . to every nilpotent group @xmath15",
    "one can associate a nilpotent lie group @xmath58 , called the _ malcev completion _ of @xmath15 ( see @xcite ) , as well as the associated graded lie group @xmath59 .",
    "[ theorem : pansu ] let @xmath60 be two finitely - generated nilpotent groups . if @xmath61 is quasi - isometric to @xmath62 then @xmath63 is isomorphic to @xmath64 .",
    "we remark that there are nilpotent groups with non - isomorphic malcev completions where the associated gradeds are isomorphic ; the examples are 7-dimensional and somewhat involved ( see @xcite , p.24 , example 2 ) .",
    "it is not known whether or not the malcev completion is a quasi - isometry invariant .",
    "theorem [ theorem : pansu ] immediately implies :    the numbers @xmath65 are quasi - isometry invariants .",
    "in particular we recover ( as special cases ) that growth and cohomological dimension are quasi - isometry invariants of @xmath15 .    to understand pansu s proof one must consider _ carnot groups_. these are graded nilpotent lie groups @xmath51 whose lie algebra @xmath66 is generated ( via bracket ) by elements of degree one .",
    "chow s theorem @xcite states that such lie groups @xmath51 have the property that the left - invariant distribution obtained from the degree one subspace @xmath67 of @xmath66 is a _ totally nonintegrable _ distribution : any two points @xmath68 can be connected by a piecewise smooth path @xmath69 in @xmath51 for which the vector @xmath70 lies in the distribution . infimizing the length of such paths between two given points",
    "gives a metric on @xmath51 , called the _ carnot carethodory _",

    "for example , when @xmath51 is the @xmath73-dimensional heisenberg group then the metric space @xmath74 has hausdorff dimension @xmath75 .",
    "one important property of carnot groups is that they come equipped with a @xmath76-parameter family of dilations @xmath77 , which gives a notion of _ ( carnot ) differentiability _ ( see @xcite ) .",
    "further , the differential @xmath78 of a map @xmath79 between carnot groups @xmath56 which is ( carnot ) differentiable at the point @xmath80 is actually a _ lie group homomorphism _ @xmath81 .    *",

    "if @xmath82 is a nilpotent group endowed with a word metric @xmath83 , the sequence of scaled metric spaces @xmath84 has a limit in the sense of gromov - hausdorff convergence : @xmath85 ( see @xcite , and @xcite for an introduction to gromov - hausdorff convergence ) .",
    "it was already known , using ultralimits , that some subsequence converges @xcite .",
    "pansu s proof not only gives convergence on the nose , but it yields some additional important features of the limit metric space @xmath86 :    * ( identifying limit ) it is isometric to the carnot group @xmath87 endowed with the carnot metric @xmath71 . * ( functoriality ) any quasi - isometry @xmath88 bewteen finitely - generated nilpotent groups induces a _ bilipschitz homeomorphism _",
    "note that functoriality follows immediately once we know the limit exists : the point is that if @xmath90 is a @xmath91 quasi - isometry of word metrics , then for each @xmath47 the map @xmath92 is a @xmath93 quasi - isometry , hence the induced map @xmath94 is a @xmath95 quasi - isometry , i.e.  is a bilipschitz homeomorphism .",
    "given a quasi - isometry @xmath96 , we thus have an induced bilipschitz homeomorphism @xmath97 between carnot groups endowed with carnot - carethodory metrics .",
    "pansu then proves a regularity theorem , generalizing the rademacher - stepanov theorem for @xmath98 .",

    "one of the major steps of @xcite in studying @xmath192 was to construct a model space @xmath193 for the group @xmath192 , study the collection of isometrically embedded hyperbolic planes in @xmath193 , and prove that for any quasi - isometric embedding of the hyperbolic plane into @xmath193 , the image has finite hausdorff distance from some isometrically embedded hyperbolic plane .",
    "however , @xmath171  has quasi - isometrically embedded hyperbolic planes which are _ not _ hausdorff close to isometrically embedded ones .",
    "the natural left invariant metric on @xmath171  has the form @xmath194 from which it follows that the @xmath195-planes and @xmath196-planes are the isometrically embedded hyperbolic planes .",
    "but none of these planes is hausdorff close to the set @xmath197 which is a quasi - isometrically embedded hyperbolic plane .",
    "an even stranger example is shown in figure  [ figurewindvane ] .",
    "these strange quasi - isometric embeddings from @xmath198 to @xmath171  do share an interesting property with the standard isometric embeddings , which may point the way to understanding quasi - isometric rigidity of @xmath171 .",
    "we say that a quasi - isometric embedding @xmath199 is _ @xmath22-quasivertical _",
    "if for each @xmath200 there exists a vertical line @xmath201 such that @xmath202 is contained in the @xmath22-neighborhood of @xmath203 , and @xmath203 is contained in the @xmath22-neighborhood of @xmath204 .    in order to study @xmath171",
    ", it therefore becomes important to understand whether every quasi - isometrically embedded hyperbolic plane is quasi - vertical . specifically :    show that for all @xmath205 there exists @xmath22 such that each @xmath205-quasi - isometrically embedded hyperbolic plane in @xmath171  is @xmath22-quasivertical .",
    "[ problemquasivertical ]    arguing by contradiction , if problem [ problemquasivertical ] were impossible , fixing @xmath205 and taking a sequence of examples whose quasi - vertical constant @xmath22 goes to infinity , one can pass to a subsequence and take a renormalized limit to produce a quasi - isometric embedding @xmath206 whose image is entirely contained in the upper half @xmath207 of @xmath171 .",
    "but we conjecture that this is impossible :    there does not exist a quasi - isometric embedding @xmath208 whose image is entirely contained in the upper half space @xmath209 .",
    "while we have already seen that there is a somewhat fine classification of finitely presented , nonpolycyclic abelian - by - cyclic groups up to quasi - isometry , this class of groups is but a very special class of finitely generated solvable groups .",
    "we have only exposed the tip of a huge iceberg .",
    "an important next layer is :      the first step in attacking this problem is to find a workable method of describing the geometry of the natural geometric model of such groups @xmath0 .",
    "such a model should fiber over @xmath98 , where @xmath47 is the rank of the maximal abelian quotient of @xmath0 ; inverse images under this projection of ( translates of ) the coordinate axes should be copies of the geometric models of abelian - by - cyclic groups .",
    "* polycyclic versus nonpolycyclic . *",
    "we ve seen the difference , at least in the abelian - by - cyclic case , between polycyclic and nonpolycyclic groups .",
    "geometrically these two classes can be distinguished by the trees on which they act : such trees are lines in the former case and infinite - ended in the latter .",
    "it is this branching behavior which should combine with coarse topology to make the nonpolycyclic groups more amenable to attack .",
    "note that a ( virtually ) polycyclic group is never quasi - isometric to a ( virtually ) nonpolycyclic solvable group .",
    "this follows from the theorem of bieri that polycylic groups are precisely those solvable groups satisfying poincare duality , together with the quasi - isometric invariance of the latter property ( proved by gersten @xcite and block - weinberger @xcite ) .",
    "* solvable groups as dynamical systems . *",
    "the connection of nilpotent groups with dynamical systems was made evident in @xcite , where gromov s polynomial growth theorem was the final ingredient , combining with earlier work of franks and shub @xcite , in the positive solution of the _ expanding maps conjecture _ : every locally distance expanding map on a closed manifold @xmath107 is topologically conjugate to an expanding algebraic endomorphism on an infranil manifold ( see @xcite ) .    in  [ section : abc ] and  [ section : abc2 ] we saw in another way how invariants from dynamics give quasi - isometry invariants for abelian - by - cyclic groups .",
    "this should be no big surprise : after all , a finitely presented abelian - by - cyclic group is describable up to commensurability as an ascending hnn extension @xmath109 over a finitely - generated abelian group @xmath50 .",
    "the matrix @xmath107 defines an endomorphism of the @xmath47-dimensional torus .",
    "the mapping torus of this endomorphism has fundamental group @xmath109 , and is the phase space of the suspension semiflow of the endomorphism , a semiflow with partially hyperbolic dynamics ( when @xmath107 is an automorphism , and so @xmath109 is polycyclic , the suspension semiflow is actually a flow ) .",
    "here we see an example of how the geometric model of a solvable group is actually the phase space of a dynamical system .",
    "but bieri - strebel @xcite have shown that _ every _ finitely presented solvable group is , up to commensurability , an ascending hnn extension with base group a finitely generated solvable group .",
    "in this way every finitely presented solvable group is the phase space of a dynamical system , probably realizable geometrically as in the abelian - by - cyclic case .",
