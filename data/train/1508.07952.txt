    "it is long known that the forward compton scattering ( cs ) amplitudes can , by unitarity , causality and crossing , be expressed through integrals of the photoabsorption cross sections  @xcite .",
    "the low - energy expansions of these expressions lead to a number of useful sum rules , most notably those of baldin @xcite , and gerasimov , drell and hearn ( gdh )  @xcite . given the photoabsorption cross sections",
    ", one can thus provide a reliable assessment of some of the static electromagnetic properties of the nucleon and nuclei , as well as of the forward cs amplitudes in general .",
    "for the proton , the first such assessments was performed in the early 1970s @xcite . since then",
    ", the knowledge of the photoabsorption cross sections appreciably improved , and yet for the unpolarized case only the baldin sum rule has been updated  @xcite . in this work , we provide a re - assessment of the forward spin - independent amplitude of proton cs , and evaluate the associated sum rules involving the _ dipole and quadrupole polarizabilities of the proton_.    sum rules are essentially the only way to gain empirical knowledge of the forward cs amplitudes .",
    "it is impossible to access the forward kinematics in real cs experiments .",
    "the measurement of the forward spin - independent cs amplitude can be done indirectly through the process of dilepton photoproduction ( @xmath1 )  @xcite .",
    "the timelike cs , involved in the process of dilepton photoproduction , yields access to real cs given the small virtuality of the outgoing photon , or equivalently , the nearly vanishing invariant mass of the produced pair .",
    "the experimental result  @xcite compared well with the aforementioned evaluations @xcite . despite the substantial additions to the database of total photoabsorption cross sections , the works of damashek and gilman ( dg ) @xcite as well as armstrong _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite remained to be , until now , the only evaluations of the full amplitude .",
    "the newer data were used , however , in the most recent evaluations of the baldin sum rule @xcite , which yields the sum of the electric and magnetic dipole polarizabilities , .",
    "these recent analyses obtained somewhat lower value for the sum than dg , cf .",
    "table [ sumruletest ] . in this work",
    "we find that the difference between the early and the recent evaluations arises from systematic inconsistencies in the experimental database .",
    "we also obtain the sum rule value for a combination of higher - order quadrupole polarizabilities and compare it with several theoretical predictions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : overview ] we give a brief overview of the kramers - kronig relation and sum rules for polarizabilities . in sect .",
    "[ sec : fitting ] we discuss the fitting procedure for the unpolarized total proton photoabsorption cross section data .",

    "the appendix demonstrates the elastic - channel contribution to the sum rules and polarizabilities on the example of one - loop scalar qed .",
    "for a spin-1/2 target , such as the proton , the forward cs amplitude is given by t_fi = f ( ) ^ + g ( ) i ( ^ ) , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are scalar functions of the photon lab energy @xmath4 ; vectors @xmath5 and @xmath6 represent the photon and proton polarizations , respectively .",
    "the crossing symmetry implies that the spin - independent amplitude @xmath2 is an even and the spin - dependent amplitude @xmath3 is an odd function of @xmath4 .",

    "averaging over the polarization of initial particles gives the unpolarized photoabsorption cross section , @xmath11 .    in the present article we focus on relations involving the spin - independent amplitude @xmath2 , and the unpolarized cross section @xmath12 .",
    "the kramers - kronig relation between these quantities exploits the optical theorem , causality and crossing symmetry , to yield for the proton  @xcite : f ( ) = - + _ 0^ ( ),where @xmath13 is the fine - structure constant and @xmath14 is the proton mass ; the slashed integral denotes the principal - value integration .",
    "we next would like to consider the low - energy expansion of @xmath2 . at this point",
    "it is important to note that the elastic scattering , i.e.  the cs process itself , is one of the photoabsorption processes .",
    "the total cs cross section does not vanish for @xmath15 but goes to a constant  the thomson cross section : ( 0 ) = .",
    "this means does not admit a taylor - series expansion around @xmath16 ( each coefficient in that expansion is infrared divergent , cf .",
    "appendix ) .",
    "such expansion is nonetheless important for establishing the polarizability sum rules .",
    "we hence prefer to take the cs out of the total cross section , i.e. : ( ) = _ ( ) + _ ( ) , where @xmath17 can be assumed to be dominated by hadron - production processes , for which there is a threshold at some @xmath18 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath2 can be decomposed accordingly into the elastic and inelastic terms , f ( ) & = & f _ ( ) + f _",
    "( ) , + f _ ( ) & = & - + _ 0^ _ (  ) , + f _",
    "( ) & = & _ _ 0^ _ (  ) .",
    "the details on dealing with @xmath19 can be found in appendix [ sec : scalarqedexample ] . in what follows",
    ", however , we neglect the contribution from @xmath20 , as it is suppressed by an extra order of @xmath21 .",
    "hence we set @xmath22 , as is usually done .    considering @xmath23 , the low - energy expansion of both sides of leads to the sum rules for polarizabilities . at the leading order [ @xmath24 , one obtains the baldin sum rule @xcite for the sum of electric ( @xmath25 ) and magnetic ( @xmath26 ) dipole polarizabilities : _ e1 + _ m1 = _ _ 0^. at @xmath27 we obtain ` the 4^th^-order sum rule ' : _ e +",

    "our aim here is to provide an empirical fit of the available data for @xmath17 and evaluate the various sum rules .",
    "the presently available experimental data , together with the results of the empirical analyses maid and said , as well as our fits are displayed in . in our fitting we distinguish the following three regions :    * _ low - energy _ , @xmath32 ; * _ medium - energy _ , @xmath33 ; * _ high - energy _",
    ", @xmath34 ;    where @xmath35 ( @xmath36 gev ) and @xmath37 ( @xmath38 gev ) are respectively the thresholds for the single- and double - pion photoproduction on the proton .    in the _ low - energy _",
    "region we use the pion production ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) cross sections from the maid @xcite and said @xcite partial - wave analyses . in our error estimate we assign a 2% uncertainty on these values .    in the _ medium - energy _",
    "region we fit the actual experimental data , using a sum of breit - wigner resonances and a background .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the corresponding full results ( sum of the three regions ) are given in table  [ sumruletest ] , and compared with the results of previous works . in this table we also give the result for the 6th - order integral , and for the full amplitude @xmath2 at @xmath44 gev .",
    "the real part of @xmath2 is plotted in over a broad energy range and compared with previous evaluations and the experimental number from the 1973 desy experiment at 2.2 gev .",
    "although none of the evaluations really contradicts the experiment , there is a clear tendency to a higher central value .",
    "the new dilepton photoproduction experiments planned at the mainz microtron ( mami ) could perhaps provide experimental values in the lower energy range .",
    "obviously , the regions of the extrema ( e.g. , the @xmath45 region or the interval between 0.6 and 0.7 gev ) are most interesting as the different evaluations seem to differ there the most . in the region around 0.6 gev , for example , one of our evaluations ( fit i ) is nearly identical with armstrong s  @xcite , while the other one ( fit ii ) is aligning with dg  @xcite and a2 coll .  @xcite .",
    "an appropriately precise experiment could tell which of the groups is correct , if any .",
    "compared to the @xmath46pt calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite . ]     and @xmath47 combinations of polarizabilities , compared to results from dispersion relation approaches ( dr ) @xcite , baryon chiral perturbation theory ( b@xmath46pt ) @xcite , and heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hb@xmath46pt ) @xcite .",
    "the errors of the @xmath46pt derive from our crude estimate of the next - order corrections . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : reim_f ] shows both the real and imaginary part of @xmath2 at lower energies , where it can be compared with a calculation done within chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath46pt ) @xcite .",
    "a rather nice agreement between theory and empirical evaluations is observed for energies up to about the pion - production threshold .    for very low energy",
    "this comparison can be made more quantitative by looking at the polarizabilities . while for the baldin sum rule the situation was extensively discussed in the literature ( cf .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) , the 4^th^-order sum rule was not studied at all .",
    "it can , however , be very useful in unraveling the higher - order polarizabilities , as illustrated by .",
    "this is the plot of a combination of proton magnetic polarizabilities versus electric , where the various theory predictions are compared with our 4^th^-order sum rule evaluation .",
    "the band representing the sum rule covers the interval between the two values given in table  [ sumruletest ] ( rows ` fit i ' and ` fit ii ' ) .",
    "the sum rule clearly provides a model - independent constraint on these polarizabilities and a rather stringent test for the theoretical approaches .",
    "the fundamental relation between the photon absorption and scattering , encompassed in the kramers - kronig type of relations , allows us to evaluate the forward compton scattering off protons using the empirical knowledge of the total photoabsorption cross sections .",
    "the present database of the unpolarized photoabsorption cross section is not entirely consistent and so as to reflect that we obtain two distinct fits to it .",
    "the two fits yield slightly different results for the spin - independent amplitude @xmath48 , and hence for its low - energy expansion characterized by the scalar polarizabilities of the proton .",
    "our two results for the sum of dipole polarizabilities ( or , baldin sum rule ) correspond nicely with the results of previous evaluations , which too can be separated into two groups : the _ old _",
    "@xcite , with the value slightly above 14 ( in units of @xmath49 fm^3^ ) , and the _ new _",
    "@xcite , with the value slightly below 14 .",
    "the 1996 daphne@mami experiment @xcite , superseding the 1972 experiment of armstrong _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , is clearly responsible for this difference .",
    "neglecting the older data in favor of the newer ones , yields the lower value of the baldin sum rule , and vice versa . while one can take a preference in one of the two fits and corresponding results , we prefer to think of their difference as a systematic uncertainty in the present evaluation of the polarizabilities and of the forward spin - independent amplitude of the proton .",
    "as far as polarizabilities are concerned , only the baldin sum rule is appreciably affected by the inconsistency in the photoabsorption database .",
    "nevertheless , the two results ( fit i and ii in table  [ sumruletest ] ) are not in conflict with each other , given the overlapping error bars .",
    "it is customary to take a statistical average in such cases .",
    "taking a weighted average , over a set @xmath50 , we use @xcite : @xmath51 ] over our two values for the baldin sum rule we obtain : @xmath52 the error bar here does directly not include the aforementioned systematic uncertainty of the cross section database .",
    "however , since the two results are fairly well surmised by the weighted average , the latter should be less prone to the systematic uncertainty of the database .",
    "we have presented a first study of the sum rule involving the quadrupole polarizabilities , , here referred to as the 4^th^-order sum rule. our weighted average value for this sum rule , in the proton case , is @xmath53 .",
    "it agrees very nicely with the state - of - the - art calculations of these polarizabilities based on fixed-@xmath54 dispersion relations and chiral perturbation theory , see .",
    "we note that , while the calculations demonstrate significant differences in the values of individual higher - order polarizabilities , these differences apparently cancel out from the forward combination of these polarizabilities which enters the sum rule .    in the subsequent paper we will discuss the evaluation of the forward _ spin - dependent _ amplitude @xmath55 and related sum rules for the forward spin polarizabilities of the proton .",
    "the knowledge of the two amplitudes will allow us to reconstruct the observables for the proton compton scattering at zero angle .",
    "we thank jrgen ahrens for kindly supplying us with a database of total photoabsorption cross sections .",
    "this work was supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( dfg ) through the collaborative research center sfb 1044 [ the low - energy frontier of the standard model ] , and the graduate school dfg / grk 1581 [ symmetry breaking in fundamental interactions ] .",
    "consider the elastic forward scattering of a photon with momentum @xmath56 from a charged spinless particle with four - momentum @xmath57 and mass @xmath58 . in the forward direction ( @xmath59 )",
    "this process is completely described by a single amplitude @xmath48 .",
    "the tree - level qed calculation ( ) yields immediately @xmath60 , where we have chosen the normalization of this amplitude to coincide with the analogous amplitude for the spin-1/2 case [ see ] ; the superscript indicates the order of @xmath21 .",
    "next we consider the one - loop corrections .",
    "figure [ imdiagrams ] shows the one - particle - irreducible ( 1pi ) diagrams appearing in scalar qed .",
    "the corresponding one - particle - reducible ( 1pr ) diagrams vanish in forward direction , due to the transversality of the photon polarization vector @xmath61 with respect to any of the four momenta , i.e. : @xmath62 .",

    "@xmath66 we note that in the low - energy limit it reproduces the thomson cross section : @xmath67 , a result that is unaltered by loop corrections , i.e.  @xmath68 .    as the total photoabsorption cross section , to this order in @xmath21 ,",
    "is given entirely by the tree - level cs cross section , the fact that @xmath69 coincides in this case with the statement of the optical theorem .",
    "we have also checked that the one - loop amplitudes satisfies the once - subtracted dispersion relation : @xmath70 and hence the full amplitude , @xmath71 , indeed enjoys the kramers - kronig relation given in .",
    "now , the whole point of this exercise is to understand the low - energy expansion , and thus the polarizability sum rules , in the case when the photoabsorption cross section is not vanishing at @xmath16 . expanding the real part of around @xmath16",
    ", we find : ( ^2 + ^4 + ^6 +  ) & = & _ n=1^^2n _ 0^ .",
    "hence , the coefficients diverge in the infrared .",
    "however , there is an apparent mismatch : they are logarithmically divergent on one side and power - divergent on the other . to match the sides exactly at each order of @xmath4 , thus defining the sum rules for `` quasi - static '' polarizabilities , we subtract all the power divergences on the right - hand side ( rhs ) and regularize both sides with the same infrared cutoff ( equal to @xmath4 ) : ( ^2 + ^4 +  ) & = & _ n=1^^2n _ ^ .",
    "+    both sides are now identical at each order of @xmath4 .",
