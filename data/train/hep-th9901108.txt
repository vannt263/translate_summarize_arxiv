    "twisted tubes , in which particles are confined by an external potential , have proven to be excellent settings for the study of quantum mechanics in curved geometries .",
    "they have been studied extensively in the context of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics , with particular focus on the case of small and slowly varying curvature@xcite .",
    "one important example is the limit of a very narrow tube , where the `` confining potential '' constrains a particle to move on a curve , just as a physical bead might be attached to a wire .",
    "subsequent authors have considered the natural extension to a particle confined to a small neighborhood of an arbitrary riemannian manifold embedded in a higher - dimensional euclidean space and have applied their formalism to the energy spectra of molecules@xcite .",
    "for a recent survey of the dynamics of a particle in various confining potentials in a loosely interpreted `` tube '' see ref.@xcite .",
    "however , analysis has been largely limited to nonrelativistic quantum mechanics , in which spin does not affect the dynamics ; the relativistic theory has been thoroughly investigated only for confinement and quantization schemes other than the confining potential approach@xcite .",
    "here we present for the first time a treatment of a relativistic dirac particle in the confining potential approach using confining boundary conditions .",
    "the phenomena associated with the propagation of a relativistic fermion within a tube contrast with the simpler and well - known case of light propagating in an optical fiber , studied in the mid-1980 s by chiao and wu@xcite .",
    "they assumed the fiber to have constant circular cross - section and small and smoothly varying curvature . in this approximation , they argued that the two states of circular polarization ( helicity @xmath2 ) propagate along the fiber without mixing with one another and accumulate opposite berry phases proportional to the integral of the torsion along the fiber .",
    "it is instructive to re - examine their argument that the helicity eigenstates do not mix@xcite .",
    "first they use the adiabatic theorem to argue that modes with different transverse waveforms do not mix as they propagate through a smooth fiber .",
    "the lowest energy level is doubly degenerate , with total angular momentum component along the axis of the fiber @xmath3 .",
    "the longitudinal mode , @xmath4 , is excluded by gauge invariance .",
    "following chiao and wu we refer to these modes somewhat loosely as photon states of helicity @xmath2 . in the limit of a thin fiber , the only surviving terms in the hamiltonian affecting helicity",
    "are of the form @xmath5 , where the `` vector curvature '' , @xmath6 , is a vector in the direction of the principal normal to the fiber and of length @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the instantaneous radius of curvature of the fiber , and @xmath9 is the photon s spin .",
    "since @xmath5 is a vector operator , the wigner - eckart theorem allows a change in helicity only by @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 is forbidden , so the helicity states propagate without mixing , even though they are degenerate  a consequence of gauge invariance .",
    "the point of departure for our paper is the observation that chiao and wu s argument does not apply to a dirac fermion , which has doubly degenerate modes with helicity @xmath12 .",
    "once again we refer to these modes somewhat loosely as fermion states of helicity @xmath13 .",
    "in particular , the ground state modes have @xmath14 , so @xmath15",
    ". the wigner - eckart theorem does not forbid transitions between these states because the eigenvalues of @xmath16 differ by 1 .",
    "we can not exclude the possibility that the degenerate angular momentum states will mix as they propagate on the basis of symmetry .",
    "therefore the dirac equation demands more careful analysis .    as in ref.@xcite",
    ", we consider a particle confined to the interior of a tube with circular cross - section .",
    "we work in the rest frame of the tube .",
    "the tube may be constructed by transporting a circular disc such that the center of the disc traces a smooth curve @xmath17 and the tangent to the curve is normal to the disc for all values of the arc - length parameter @xmath18 .",
    "the region swept out by the disc is the tube .",
    "we model the potential that confines the particle to the tube by means of a boundary condition .",
    "the boundary condition must guarantee that the normal component of the probability current @xmath19 vanishes on the surface of the tube . in the nonrelativistic problem",
    "one can simply impose dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "however , in the dirac theory , the requirement that all components of the wavefunction vanish on the boundary is too stringent , for then in general the dirac wavefunction will vanish everywhere . a less severe condition that will still confine probability is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the unit normal ( in the outward sense ) to the boundary of the tube@xcite .",
    "that eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) guarantees probability confinement follows from the commutation relations for the @xmath22-matrices and the antihermiticity of @xmath23 .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) reduces to the usual dirichlet boundary condition on the `` large '' components of the dirac spinor in the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "it is a general feature of the dirac equation that spin and orbital angular momentum are not separately conserved .",
    "it is not surprising , therefore , that the boundary condition , eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) does not commute with the spin operator .",
    "the result is the nontrivial transport of angular momentum states that we will calculate .",
    "we could have chosen other boundary conditions , for example the chiral generalization of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , @xmath24 parameterized by the chiral angle @xmath25 , with a slightly different phenomenology .",
    "we will explore some of the alternatives in the final section of this paper .    in section",
    "ii we establish coordinates in the interior of the tube that will be convenient for our purposes .",
    "section iii is a construction of the dynamical equations of our system in the parallel transport frame .",
    "we write the dynamical equations as those for propagation in a straight tube with an interaction . in section",
    "iv we calculate the necessary basis states for a dirac particle in a straight tube . in section",
    "v we specialize to the approximation that the curvature is small and slowly varying .",
    "this approximation appears to capture most of the interesting physics .",
    "we then expand the hamiltonian to lowest nontrivial order in small parameters . using the resulting hamiltonian ,",
    "we compute in section vi the relevant dynamical equations .",
    "section vii contains our conclusions and also briefly discusses possibilities for boundary conditions other than eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "we construct a coordinate system for the tube described in section i by erecting a right - handed orthonormal frame at each point on the curve .",
    "we parameterize the curve as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the arc - length parameter .",
    "since the tangent to the curve is always normal to the cross - sectional disc that sweeps out the tube , a natural choice of frame is @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are orthogonal unit vectors in the plane of the disc and @xmath29 is the unit tangent to the disc in the direction of increasing @xmath18 . for clarity",

    ", we must specify the @xmath18-dependence of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "we require that the frame rotates smoothly as the disc sweeps out the tube .",
    "that is , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a smoothly varying instantaneous `` angular velocity '' associated with the rotation of the frame .",
    "since the curve uniquely determines @xmath39 , it determines @xmath38 up to the addition of a constant multiple of @xmath39 , corresponding to an additional rotation of the transverse axes about the tangent . for simplicity",
    ", we adopt the `` parallel transport '' frame , in which @xmath40 has no component along the tangent .",
    "there is a simple visual model of the parallel transport frame .",
    "imagine a rigid wire with a disc attached to it by a frictionless sleeve that keeps the disc normal to the sleeve . without friction all the torques act in the plane of the disc so the angular momentum about the tangent direction",
    "is conserved .",
    "if the disc has no angular velocity about @xmath29 initially , it will not develop any . in this case",
    ", vectors drawn on the disc are said to execute parallel transport along the wire .",
    "a simple calculation shows that the instantaneous angular velocity of this frame is @xmath41 a new coordinate system for points inside the tube may now be specified in terms of the parallel transport frame by @xmath42 in this coordinate system , the spatial metric tensor is diagonal @xmath43 where the vector curvature @xmath44 of @xmath45 is defined as @xmath46 comparison with the definition of @xmath47 shows @xmath48 the diagonal metric tensor yields a simple gradient operator : @xmath49 the volume element for integration in these coordinates is @xmath50 . since the tube intersects itself if @xmath51 equals one , we require that @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the radius of the disc .",
    "an important subtlety is that while the choice of the parallel transport frame is always valid locally , it is not always possible to adopt it globally .",
    "in particular , if the curve is closed , parallel transport of the frame through one circuit of the curve need not return the frame to its original orientation .",
    "this geometric feature manifests itself in classical physics as the well - known hannay s angle@xcite . for the purposes of this paper",
    ", we assume that our tube continues indefinitely without intersecting itself .",
    "in free space , with units such that @xmath54 , the hamiltonian in the dirac equation @xmath55 is @xmath56 we define @xmath57 and @xmath58 as usual by @xmath59 and @xmath60 ; in the chiral basis that we employ , @xmath61    in the coordinate system defined in section ii , the dirac hamiltonian takes the form @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",

    "elements _ of @xmath209 in the @xmath219 basis and its matrix in the basis of eigenstates of @xmath235 .",
    "the constant of proportionality , @xmath222 , measures the rate at which the spin vector rotates in the parallel transport frame as the wave propagates . in the nonrelativistic limit , @xmath236 so @xmath237 , and the spin completely decouples from the evolution of the tube . if @xmath222 were zero for some choice of parameters , the spin would remain fixed in the parallel transport frame as for the photon . in the ultrarelativistic limit , @xmath238 and @xmath239 , the lowest root of the equation @xmath240 .",
    "substitution gives @xmath241 , so that even in the extreme relativistic limit helicity is not conserved .",
    "we now project the second - order dirac equation , @xmath197 , onto the lowest multiplet , @xmath219 .",

    "just as the pauli matrices , @xmath248 , rotate @xmath249 states into @xmath250 states , the matrices @xmath251 rotate the @xmath252 states into @xmath253 states .",
    "( [ eq5.7 ] ) is our fundamental result .",
    "relativistic effects appear in two places .",
    "first , as pointed out earlier , the rotation back to the laboratory fixed frame is only complete in the nonrelativistic limit , when @xmath233 . as @xmath132 increases relative to @xmath162",
    ", @xmath222 decreases . the ideal case of @xmath254 , in which the helicity is conserved ,",
    "is not reached even in the extreme relativistic limit .",
    "the following section discusses opportunities presented by other choices of boundary conditions .",
    "second , the depolarizing factor appears in the effective scalar potential , @xmath255 .",
    "if we apply the obvious unitary transformation @xmath256 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq3.9 ] ) ) , where @xmath257 , \\label{eq5.9}\\ ] ] then the dirac equation for @xmath258 reduces to the scalar case @xmath259 this equation can be solved numerically for a given tube , with the usual phenomenology of bound and scattering states .",
    "it is helpful to interpret our results first in the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "we expect to find no coupling to the spin because the nonrelativistic boundary conditions do not involve spin at all and the exact hamiltonian commutes with @xmath9 .",
    "it is reassuring to see that our formalism recovers this result : in the nonrelativistic limit , @xmath260 , so that in the parallel transport frame , the spin appears to rotate with angular frequency @xmath261 , where the minus sign indicates that the sense of the rotation is opposite that of the coordinate frame .",
    "in other words , the spin vector maintains its orientation in the three - dimensional euclidean space in which the tube is embedded ( which corresponds to the coordinate frame of some three - dimensional euclidean experimenter ) .",
    "away from the nonrelativistic limit , @xmath262 , so the variation of spin is no longer exactly opposite to the rotation of the parallel transport frame .",
    "now if @xmath222 were to go to zero , the vector @xmath263 would not rotate relative to the axis of the tube .",
    "this would parallel the phenomenon described by chiao and wu .",
    "however , @xmath222 is never zero in the lowest energy subspace . even for @xmath264 , @xmath265 .",
    "we obtain a complete description of @xmath222 as a function of @xmath172 by solving for the lowest root of the eigenvalue condition eq .",
    "( [ eq4.5 ] ) as a function of @xmath162 and substituting in the expression eq .",
    "( [ eq5.5 ] ) for @xmath222 .",
    "a plot of @xmath222 versus @xmath172 appears in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) . the states with @xmath266",
    "do have @xmath260 as @xmath267 , as we expect .",
    "however , the states for which @xmath268 have @xmath269 in the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "this `` unphysical '' result appears as an artifact of the adiabatic approximation , which breaks down for these states in the nonrelativistic limit , as explained in section vi .",
    "@xmath270    the effect of the factor @xmath222 on the vector @xmath263 has a simple geometric interpretation . as an example , consider a tube whose defining curve lies in a plane and such that it has two straight sections , @xmath271 , joined by a section with constant curvature @xmath7 and center of curvature @xmath272 .",
    "in addition , construct a complementary tube parameterized by the same arc - length parameter @xmath18 satisfying the following conditions : it is parallel to the first for @xmath273 ; it has a section of constant curvature @xmath274 with center of curvature @xmath272 for @xmath275 ; and it has another straight section for @xmath276 .",
    "the smaller curvature implies a larger radius of curvature .",
    "the effect of the depolarizing factor can be summarized by the following construction : as the dirac particle traverses the curved section of the tube , the vector @xmath263 remains fixed relative to the tangent of the complementary curve at the corresponding value of @xmath18 . for @xmath264",
    ", if the tube curves through @xmath277 , then @xmath263 falls behind the tangent by approximately @xmath278 .    in our formalism",
    ", we have used the boundary condition eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) to simulate a hard - wall potential barrier .",
    "many of the qualitative features of our results follow from the fact that spin is not a good quantum number for the dirac equation subject to such a boundary condition .",
    "it is natural to ask how sensitive these results are to the specific choice of confining boundary condition .",
    "an obvious generalization given in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) is characterized by a chiral angle @xmath25 .",
    "we have chosen @xmath279 throughout ; let us now take @xmath280 . if we set @xmath281 , we can map this version back to the original boundary condition at the cost of introducing a `` chiral '' mass term into the dirac equation : @xmath282 -i \\vec{\\gamma } \\cdot \\hat{r } \\psi ' & = & \\psi'\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] repeating the calculations in the earlier sections shows that the sole effect of the chiral angle is to replace @xmath162 by @xmath283 in the expression for the parameter @xmath226 and thus implicitly in the boundary conditions and depolarizing factor .",
    "thus the analysis above , with an effective mass @xmath284 , applies to this family of problems .",
    "in fact , for @xmath285 , the plot in fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) describes the depolarizing factor as a function of @xmath286 . when @xmath286 becomes negative new phenomena arise .",
    "in particular , the boundary condition eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) acts like an effective attractive potential at @xmath287 . as a result for",
    "sufficiently negative @xmath286 a qualitatively new solution appears in each partial wave , which is `` bound to '' @xmath287 and decays exponentially as @xmath288 decreases .",
    "the detailed study of these states is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "in addition to these boundary conditions , there are other families of boundary conditions that confine the probability current but which we have not yet considered in detail",
    ". specifically one can generalize eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) by the condition @xmath289 where @xmath290 is any antihermitian dirac matrix that anticommutes with @xmath291 . @xmath290 need not be constant , as the demonstration of probability confinement involves only algebraic manipulations .",
    "interesting alternatives include @xmath292 , @xmath293 and @xmath294 .",
    "each of these choices will generate different , nontrivial spin effects .",
    "thus we believe that the essential feature of nontrivial spin transport should not be unique to our choice of boundary condition .",
    "another direction of possible future work is the generalization of our approach to higher - dimensional spaces , as has been done with the nonrelativistic theory .",
