    "the great mystery in particle physics is the cosmological constant problem : why is the cosmological constant @xmath7 so tiny compared to the planck scale @xmath8 or the string scale , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath9 ?",
    "there is no known symmetry in string theory that constrains the cosmological constant to be zero .",
    "another major puzzle is the gauge hierarchy problem . in the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "radiative corrections to the higgs boson ( or a scalar in general ) mass is quadratically dependent on the uv cutoff scale , and its mass is unprotected by any chiral or gauge symmetry .",
    "thus , the natural higgs mass is of the order of the uv cutoff scale rather than the weak scale .",
    "plausibly the uv cutoff scale should be around the planck scale or string scale .",
    "the many orders of magnitude difference between the uv cutoff scale and the weak scale is the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "a well known solution to this problem is supersymmetry .",
    "however , supersymmetry can ameliorate but does not solve the cosmological constant problem .",
    "in string models with flux compactifications there exists an enormous `` landscape '' for long - lived metastable string / m theory vacua where the moduli can be stabilized and supersymmetry may be broken  @xcite . in particular , applying the `` weak anthropic principle ''  @xcite , the string landscape proposal may provide the first concrete explanation of the very tiny value of the cosmological constant , which can take only discrete values , and it may also address the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "notably , the supersymmetry breaking scale can be high if there exist many supersymmetry breaking parameters or many hidden sectors  @xcite .",
    "although there is no definite conclusion whether the string landscape predicts high - scale or tev - scale supersymmetry breaking  @xcite , it is interesting to study models with high - scale supersymmetry breaking as we await the turn on of the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite .",
    "if supersymmetry is indeed broken at a high scale , the breaking scale can range from 1 tev to the string scale .",
    "three representative choices for the supersymmetry breaking scale can be considered@xcite : ( 1 )  the string scale , ( 2 )  an intermediate scale , and ( 3 )  the tev scale . because tev - scale supersymmetry has been studied extensively during the last two decades , we do not consider it here . we emphasize that for string - scale and intermediate - scale supersymmetry breakings , most of the problems associated with low energy supersymmetric models , for example , excessive flavor and cp violations , dimension-5 fast proton decay and the stringent constraints on the lightest cp even neutral higgs boson mass , are solved automatically .    for intermediate - scale supersymmetry breaking ,",
    "arkani - hamed and dimopoulos proposed the split supersymmetry scenario where the scalars ( squarks , sleptons and one combination of the scalar higgs doublets ) have masses at an intermediate scale , while the fermions ( gauginos and higgsinos ) and the other combination of the scalar higgs doublets are at the tev scale  @xcite .",
    "gauge coupling unification is preserved and the lightest neutralino can still be a dark matter candidate .",
    "the realization and phenomenological consequences of split supersymmetry have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "however , unlike the cosmological constant problem and the gauge hierarchy problem , the strong cp problem is still a challenge for naturalness in the string landscape  @xcite . in the standard model ,",
    "the @xmath10 parameter is a dimensionless coupling constant which is infinitely renormalized by radiative corrections .",
    "there is no theoretical reason for @xmath10 as small as @xmath11 required by the experimental bound on the electric dipole moment of the neutron  @xcite .",
    "there is also no known anthropic constraint on the value of @xmath10 , _ i.e. _ , @xmath10 may be a random variable with a roughly uniform distribution in the string landscape  @xcite .",
    "in addition , from flux - induced supersymmetry breaking in type iib orientifolds  @xcite , supersymmetry breaking soft masses are all approximately of the same order in general .",
    "supersymmetric axion models with an approximately universal intermediate - scale ( @xmath12  gev ) supersymmetry breaking were proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the strong cp problem is solved by the well - known peccei  quinn mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the global pq symmetry is protected against quantum gravitational violation by considering the gauged discrete @xmath13 pq symmetry @xcite , which can be embedded in an anomalous @xmath14 gauge symmetry in string constructions where the anomalies can be cancelled by the green  schwarz mechanism  @xcite .",
    "in these models , the axion can be a cold dark matter candidate , and the intermediate supersymmetry breaking scale is directly related to the pq symmetry breaking scale .",
    "gauge coupling unification can be achieved at about @xmath15  gev due to additional sm vector - like fields at the intermediate scale , and the higgs mass range is from 130  gev to 160  gev @xcite .    for string - scale supersymmetry breaking , axion models in which gauge coupling unification can be realized by introducing sm vector - like fermions were discussed in ref .",
    "then , we proposed the sm as a low energy effective theory where gauge coupling unification can be achieved by choosing suitable @xmath1 normalizations  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we consider an approximately universal grand unification scale or string - scale supersymmetry breaking @xcite . to solve the strong cp problem in the string landscape",
    ", we adopt the pq mechanism  @xcite with the axion as the cold dark matter candidate . because the supersymmetry breaking scale is around the grand unification scale or the string scale , the minimal model at low energy is the standard model .",
    "the sm explains existing experimental data very well , including electroweak precision tests .",
    "in addition , it is easy to incorporate aspects of physics beyond the sm through small variations , for example , dark matter , dark energy , atmospheric and solar neutrino oscillations , baryon asymmetry and inflation  @xcite .",
    "the sm fermion masses and mixings can be explained via the froggatt - nielsen mechanism  @xcite . however , there are still some limitations of the sm , for example , the lack of explanation of gauge coupling unification and charge quantization .",
    "charge quantization can easily be realized by embedding the sm into a grand unified theory ( gut ) .",
    "anticipating that the higgs particle could be the only new physics observed at the lhc , thus confirming the sm as the low energy effective theory , it is appropriate to reconsider gauge coupling unification in the sm .",
    "however , it is well known that gauge coupling unification can not be achieved in the sm with the canonical normalization of the @xmath1 hypercharge interaction , _",
    "i.e. _ , the georgi - glashow @xmath16 normalization  @xcite",
    ". gauge coupling unification can be achieved in the sm by introducing extra multiplets between the weak and gut scales  @xcite or large threshold corrections  @xcite , which generically introduce more fine - tuning into the theory . to avoid proton decay induced by dimension-6 operators via heavy gauge boson exchanges ,",
    "the gauge coupling unification scale is constrained to be higher than about @xmath17 gev .",
    "we shall reexamine gauge coupling unification in the sm @xcite .",
    "the gauge couplings for @xmath3 and @xmath18 are unified at about @xmath0 gev , and the gauge coupling for the @xmath1 at that scale depends on its normalization .",
    "if we choose a suitable normalization of the @xmath1 , the three gauge couplings for @xmath3 , @xmath18 and @xmath1 can in fact be unified at about @xmath0 gev , and then there is no proton decay problem via dimension-6 operators .",
    "thus , the key question is : _ is the canonical normalization for @xmath1 unique ? _    for a 4-dimensional",
    "( 4d ) gut with a simple group , the canonical @xmath1 normalization is the only possibility , assuming that the sm fermions form complete multiplets under the gut group .",

    "we discuss these possibilities below :    \\(1 ) in weakly coupled heterotic string theory , the gauge and gravitational couplings always automatically unify at tree level to form one dimensionless string coupling constant @xmath19 @xcite @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are the gauge couplings for the @xmath1 , @xmath18 , and @xmath3 gauge groups , respectively ; @xmath24 is the gravitational coupling ; and @xmath25 is the string tension . here ,",
    "@xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the levels of the corresponding kac - moody algebras ; @xmath27 and @xmath28 are positive integers while @xmath26 is in general a rational number @xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) in intersecting d - brane model building on type ii orientifolds , the normalization for the @xmath1 ( and also other gauge factors ) is not canonical in general @xcite .",
    "\\(3 ) in orbifold guts @xcite , only the sm or sm - like gauge symmetry should be preserved on the 3-branes at the fixed points @xcite .",
    "then the sm fermions , which can be localized on the 3-brane at a fixed point , need not form complete multiplets under the gut group .",
    "thus , the @xmath1 normalization need not be canonical .",
    "this statement also holds for the deconstruction of orbifold guts @xcite and for 4d guts with product gauge groups .    in this paper",
    "we shall assume that at the gut or string scale , the gauge couplings in the sm satisfy @xmath29 where @xmath30 , in which @xmath31 for canonical normalization .",
    "we show that gauge coupling unification in the sm can be achieved at about @xmath0 gev for @xmath32 , 5/4 , 32/25 . especially for @xmath32 ,",
    "gauge coupling unification in the sm is well satisfied at two loop order .",
    "in addition , with gut scale supersymmetry breaking , we predict that the higgs mass is in the range 127 gev to 165 gev when the top quark mass is varied within its @xmath33 experimental range and the @xmath3 gauge coupling within its @xmath34 range .",
    "the top quark mass can be measured to about @xmath35 gev accuracy at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "assuming this accuracy and its central value of @xmath36 gev , the higgs boson mass is predicted to be between @xmath5 gev and @xmath6 gev .",
    "moreover , we point out that gauge coupling unification in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) does not require @xmath31 , and we show that gauge coupling unification in the mssm can be achieved to the same degree by the choice @xmath37 .    furthermore ,",
    "on the space - time @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the 4d minkowski space - time , we construct a 7-dimensional ( 7d ) @xmath40 model with @xmath32 and 7d @xmath41 models with @xmath42 and 32/25 . in these models ,",
    "the @xmath40 and @xmath41 gauge symmetries can be broken down to the sm - like gauge symmetries via orbifold projections and be further broken down to the sm gauge symmetry by the higgs mechanism .",
    "a right - handed top quark in the @xmath40 model and one pair of higgs doublets in the @xmath41 models can be obtained from the zero modes of the bulk vector multiplet , and their hypercharges are determined from the constructions .",
    "then , charge quantization can be achieved from the anomaly free conditions and the gauge invariance of the yukawa couplings .",
    "the extra @xmath43 gauge symmetries can be considered as flavour symmetries , and the sm fermion masses and mixings may be explained naturally via the froggatt - nielsen mechanism @xcite .",

    "similar to the above subsection , we introduce three families of sm fermions on the observable 3-brane at @xmath186 and charge quantization can be realized .",
    "the @xmath238 gauge symmetry can be considered as a flavour symmetry , and it can be broken at the gut scale by introducing three pairs of the sm singlets with non - trivial @xmath238 charges on the observable 3-brane .",
    "in addition , the exotic particles from the zero modes of chiral multiplets @xmath239 can be made very heavy after the @xmath238 gauge symmetry breaking by coupling them to the extra fields on the observable 3-brane .      in 5-dimensional",

    "i.e. _ , @xmath241 where @xmath242 , @xmath243 and @xmath244 are the properly normalized 4d effective gauge couplings from 5d @xmath16 or 6d @xmath240 gauge kinetic terms .",
    "because we have @xmath245 at the unification scale , we obtain @xmath246    however , on the 3-branes at the fixed points , only the sm or sm - like gauge symmetry should be preserved , so there exists the possibility that one may introduce the 3-brane localized gauge kinetic terms from the effective field theory point of view  @xcite .",
    "thus , the effective sm gauge couplings @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 at the unification scale become @xmath247 where @xmath248 , @xmath249 and @xmath250 are the properly normalized 4d effective gauge couplings from 3-brane localized gauge kinetic terms . in general , we have @xmath251 thus , at the unification scale , we obtain @xmath252 therefore , the @xmath1 ( and other gauge factors ) normalization is not canonical .    in this paper",
    "we just point out this possibility , but we do not take it seriously for these reasons : ( 1 ) to achieve the gauge coupling unification in the sm , we need to fine - tune the brane localized gauge kinetic terms ; ( 2 ) there are no such brane localized gauge kinetic terms in the orbifold compactifications of the weakly coupled heterotic string theory  @xcite ; thus , whether such terms do exist is unresolved .",
    "how to test our models with different @xmath1 normalizations is an interesting question .",
    "however , it is very difficult for two reasons .",
    "first , there exist unkown threshhold corrections ( including the supersymmetric threshold corrections ) close to the gut scale because a lot of new particles may appear , and higher - dimensional operators may also contribute to the gauge couplings , so the concrete prediction for one of the three sm gauge couplings at the weak scale due to the rge running from the unification scale will be gut model dependent .",
    "furthermore , the rge running of the gauge couplings in the sm for different @xmath1 normalizations will not cause any physically different results at low energy , _",
    "i.  e. _ , the sm with different @xmath1 normalizations are equivalent as low energy effective theories .",
    "the string landscape suggests that the supersymmetry breaking scale can be high and then the simplest low energy effective theory is just the sm . considering gut scale supersymmetry breaking",
    ", we showed that gauge coupling unification in the sm can be achieved at about @xmath0 gev for @xmath32 , 5/4 , 32/25 .",
    "especially for @xmath32 , gauge coupling unification in the sm is well satisfied at two loop order .",
    "we also predicted that the higgs mass is in the range 127 gev to 165 gev by varying @xmath64 within its @xmath34 range , @xmath2 within its @xmath33 range and @xmath93 from @xmath94 to @xmath95 .",
    "for a future top quark mass measurement of value and uncertainty @xmath4 gev , for example , we obtained a higgs boson mass between @xmath5 gev and @xmath6 gev .",
    "moreover , we pointed out that gauge coupling unification in the mssm does not necessarily imply @xmath31 .",
    "we showed that gauge coupling unification in the mssm can be achieved at the same level by choosing @xmath37 .",
    "furthermore , we constructed a 7d @xmath40 model with @xmath32 and 7d @xmath41 models with @xmath42 and 32/25 on the space - time @xmath38 . in these models ,",
    "the @xmath40 and @xmath41 gauge symmetries can be broken down to the sm - like gauge symmetries via orbifold projections and then broken further down to the sm gauge symmetry by the higgs mechanism .",
    "the right - handed top quark in the @xmath40 model and one pair of the higgs doublets in the @xmath41 models can be obtained from the zero modes of the bulk vector multiplet , with their hypercharges determined by the constructions .",
