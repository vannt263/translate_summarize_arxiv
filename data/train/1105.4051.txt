    "magnetic tunnel junction ( mtj ) has attracted great attention due to its importance in magnetic random - access memory ( mram ) and read - sensor technology .",
    "a basic mtj is made of two ferromagnetic ( fm ) layers sandwiching a thin insulating material .",
    "digital information is coded by magnetic moments of the fm layer being in parallel or anti - parallel configurations ( pc or apc ) . in commercial mrams , switching between pc and apc is achieved by external magnetic fields .",
    "an emerging trend is to switch by spin - transfer torque ( stt ) predicted theoretically@xcite and demonstrated experimentally@xcite where a spin - polarized current transfers angular momentum to a fm layer causing magnetic moment reversal .",
    "stt holds great promise to simplify the mram structure , down - scale device size , and reduce power consumption .",
    "one of the most important issues concerning stt is its dependence on external bias voltage @xmath0 that drives the spin - polarized current in the first place .",
    "understanding this issue is rather difficult not only because torque is a vector@xcite but also because stt operates at non - equilibrium due to the flow of spin currents .",
    "a physical picture concerning the bias dependence of stt , from the linear to nonlinear bias regime , is yet to be established from atomic first principles .",
    "theoretically , @xmath0 dependence of stt was investigated by model analysis such as the tight - binding model@xcite and free - electron model.@xcite more recently , heiliger and stiles@xcite analyzed stt for an mgo based mtj based on equilibrium electronic structure obtained from density - functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "the in - plane stt was calculatedheiliger2008 up to @xmath1 v and showed essentially a linear dependence on @xmath0 , and the out - of - plane stt was found to be quadratic in @xmath2 , which is consistent with tight - binding@xcite and experimental results.@xcite    existing calculations provided valuable understanding of stt at the small @xmath3 regime . to establish a complete picture , it is important to investigate stt at higher bias from atomic first principles .",
    "indeed , recent experimental data@xcite already showed a strong nonlinear @xmath4 dependence of in - plane stt , and observable non - quadratic out - of - plane stt beyond @xmath5v .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to report a first - principles analysis of stt in the most technologically important fe / mgo / fe mtj from low- to high - bias regimes , focusing on its nonlinear @xmath3 dependence .",
    "we found that the in - plane stt changes from linear to nonlinear dependence as @xmath4 is increased from zero .",
    "the angle dependence of stt is symmetric at low bias but asymmetric at high bias .",
    "the nonlinear behavior is marked by a threshold point in the stt versus bias curve which is controlled by a resonant transmission channel in the apc current .",
    "we also found that the nonlinear stt is affected by atomic defects@xmath6oxygen vacancies in mgo@xmath6hence , in principle , can be tuned by interface engineering .",

    "our calculation is from first principles where dft is carried out within the keldysh nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) method.@xcite here , dft determines the hamiltonian of the open device structure , and negf determines the nonequilibrium statistics of the device operation and the nonequilibrium density matrix .",

    "we conclude that the sudden increase of @xmath33 is due to the abrupt increase of the @xmath64 channel transmission , which , importantly , is also due to bias - dependent transport features as we explain now .",

    "the contribution of @xmath83 and @xmath84 bands to the total transmission is k@xmath85 dependent , giving rise to the ring in the hot spot .",
    "a higher bias significantly changes the shape of the tunnel barrier : we checked that by artificially flattening the barrier potential from the biased slop shape , this sharp apc resonant channel disappears .",
    "actually , the existence of resonance is not only responsible for the sudden increase of stt but also responsible for the deviation of angular - dependent stt as shown in the inset ( c ) of fig .",
    "when at a resonant ring such as a point ( @xmath86 @xmath50 ) , the angular - dependent in - plane stt deviates from a sine function and follows similar behavior as that in fig .",

    "second , both symmetric junctions where the same ov concentration is on both fe / mgo interfaces ( black curve with solid squares ) , and asymmetric junctions where ovs only exist at one fe / mgo interface ( red curve with solid circles ) , yield almost the same @xmath38 .",
    "in particular , its slope @xmath96 . this value is only slightly larger than that of the ideal junction , which has @xmath97 .",
    "hence , a small amount of ov ( e.g. 3% ) does not alter @xmath38 significantly .",
    "these results should be compared to the experimental value of the slope @xmath98 measured at @xmath99 v.@xcite giving the uncertainties in comparing our atomic structure to the experimental one , the quantitative consistency of our results is quite satisfactory .",

    ", filling the ovs with n using the alloy model o@xmath100n@xmath66 , we found that the @xmath38 is somewhat decreased , namely , its slope @xmath101 ( blue curve with up - triangles ) .",
    "similar to the ideal junction , systems with ov also show abrupt increase of @xmath102 at higher bias , which , we found , is also due to the quantum resonance in the 2d bz discussed above .",
    "different from the ideal case , existence of ovs shifts the threshold bias of @xmath38 to lower values thus bringing it closer to the experimental result.@xcite as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the effect of ov on @xmath38 can also be understood by investigating transmission of the @xmath64 channel in apc .",
    "the ovs induce two new effects .",
    "first , interfacial ovs broaden the area having high transmission values in the hot spots and also suppress the transmission peak from 1.0 @xmath103 to about 0.35 @xmath103 ( at 3% ov on both interfaces ) .",
    "the overall effect is to enhance @xmath38 slightly .",
    "second , interfacial ovs shift the resonant peak in the @xmath64 channel of apc to lower energy and , as a result , the threshold bias is now shifted to lower values .    remarkably , from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] one can determine which fe / mgo interface dominates stt .",
    "when ovs exist at both interfaces ( black curve with solid squares ) , the threshold bias shifts to lower values from those of the clean sample for both @xmath4 polarity . when ovs exist only at the right fe / mgo interface ( red curve with solid circles ) , the threshold bias shifts to lower value only in the negative @xmath4 . when ovs are filled by n atoms ( blue curve with up - triangles ) , the threshold bias shifts to higher @xmath4 for both polarities .",
    "quantitatively , the threshold bias is @xmath560.45v in the presence of 3% ov at interface .",
    "it is consistent with the experimental value @xmath560.4 v ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) with a 1.25-nm ( 6-ml ) mgo barrier . a more recent experiment measured a threshold bias @xmath560.2 v ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) with a 1.0-nm ( 5-ml ) mgo barrier .",
    "the experimentally measured resistance is 1.5 @xmath104m@xmath105 also close to our calculated value for a junction with a 5-ml mgo barrier .",
    "the effects of ovs on the out - of - plane stt are also very important .",
    "we have examined a junction using the wave - function - matching method .",
    "the calculation was done in a @xmath106 lateral supercell containing five randomly distributed ovs at each fe - mgo interface ( thus @xmath107 ) . for @xmath108 v and @xmath109 ev , the calculated in - plane and out - of - plane stt are @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively .",

    "the larger in - plane and out - of - plane stt in the 10% ov sample is attributed to the resonant tunneling discussed above .",
    "these results indicate that the interfacial ov disorder is not detrimental to the value of the out - of - plane stt . in comparison",
    ", interface roughness disorder quenches the out - of - plane stt as reported in ref . .",
    "in summary , the bias dependence of stt was investigated from atomic first principles , covering both low- and high - bias regimes .",
    "stt shows weak and linear bias dependence at small @xmath4 but strong and nonlinear dependence at higher @xmath4 .",
    "the angle dependence of stt is symmetric at low bias but asymmetric at high bias .",
    "the nonlinear behavior is marked by a threshold bias in the stt versus bias curve and is controlled by a resonant transmission channel in apc .",
    "very importantly , disorder scattering by small amount of oxygen vacancies in mgo lowers the stt threshold bias but not the stt value , suggesting that the nonlinear stt can be tuned by clever interfacial engineering as also reported in ref . where crystal - growth temperature changes the ov contents .",
