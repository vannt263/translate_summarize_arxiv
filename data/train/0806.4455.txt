    "understanding the adiabatic quantum dynamics of many - body systems is central to many areas of physics and information science . in adiabatic quantum computation  @xcite , or in quantum annealing",
    "( see [ ] for a review ) the ultimate goal is to find the ground state of a complex system by adiabatically transforming the underlying hamiltonian .",
    "indeed any quantum algorithm can be efficiently implemented through the adiabatic evolution of a system from an initial exactly known state toward a unknown final one in which encodes the answer to the specific computational task  @xcite .",
    "once the time scale on which the hamiltonian is varied is large compared to the typical inverse spectral gap of the system , the quantum adiabatic theorem  @xcite ensures that if the system was prepared in the ground state of the initial hamiltonian , at the end of the evolution the quantum state will be the ground state of the final hamiltonian .",
    "the bottleneck to the speed at which the algorithm is performed is thus given by those places where the instantaneous hamiltonian has a spectrum where the gap closes in the thermodynamic limit , i.e. as the number of qubits increases . if the minimum gap closes faster than a power of the number of qubits then the corresponding computational task is intractable .",
    "the closing of a gap between the ground state and the first excited level in the thermodynamic limit is a distinct feature of second order quantum phase transition .",
    "it is responsible for the critical slowling down  @xcite , and the evolution becomes necessarily not adiabatic .",
    "the problem of adiabatic dynamics close to a critical point , and the consequent defects formation , has originally born in the study of phase transitions in the early universe  @xcite . the recent extension to the quantum case  @xcite has stimulated an intense theoretical activity  @xcite .    in the search for a deeper understanding of the loss of adiabaticity on crossing a quantum critical point an important role is played by exactly solvable models .",
    "the study of non - equilibrium many - body system is indeed a formidable task and the help of a tractable exactly solvable system can be of great help in testing approximate approaches , besides being of interest in itself .",
    "most of the work done so far in this direction concentrated on one - dimensional quantum systems with short range interaction . in this paper",
    "we would like address a complementary limit , i.e. a model with infinite coordination ( in the thermodynamic limit ) , but still amenable of an exact solution : the lipkin - meschkov - glick model ( lmg ) .",
    "first introduced by lipkin , meschkov and glick  @xcite in the context of nuclear physics , it was then adopted by the condensed matter community as paradigm of an infinitely coordinated solvable system  @xcite .",
    "the result of a sudden quench in this model was recently discussed in  @xcite , here we present results in the opposite regime in which the system is dragged adiabatically through the critical point . as it will be shown in the following ,",
    "although the phase transition is of mean field nature , the dynamics leads to non - trivial results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ model_sec ] we introduce the lipkin - meschkov - glick model and briefly review its properties which are important for the purposes of this work . in the same section",

    "we use the residual energy ( the excess energy as compared to the adiabatic limit ) , the incomplete magnetization ( the deficit magnetization as compared to the adiabatic limit ) and the entanglement entropy . the numerical results together with the corresponding scaling arguments are presented in sec .  [ results_sec ] . in the final section we present a critical assessment of our findings .",
    "the properties of the lmg model have been thoroughly scrutinized in the literature ( see e.g. [ ] and references therein ) .",
    "below we briefly recall few results that are relevant to the present paper .",
    "the lmg hamiltonian describes a system of spins ( 1/2 in this work ) interacting through an infinite - range exchange coupling and immersed in a transverse field . assuming that the field is directed along the z - direction the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the number of the spins in the system , @xmath6 are the pauli operators",
    ", @xmath7 is the anisotropy parameter and @xmath8 is the transverse field . by introducing the total spin operator @xmath9 , the hamiltonian can be rewritten , apart from a additive constant , as @xmath10-\\gamma \\mathcal{s}_z$ ] .",
    "the hamiltonian hence commutes with @xmath11 and does not couple states having a different parity of the number of spins pointing in the magnetic field direction : @xmath12=0 $ ] and @xmath13=0 $ ] . in the isotropic case @xmath14",
    "also the z - component @xmath15 is conserved , @xmath16=0 $ ] .    in the thermodynamical limit",
    "the lmg model undergoes a second order quantum phase transition at @xmath17 characterized by mean - field critical exponents  @xcite .",
    "the magnetization in the @xmath18-direction ( or in the @xmath19-plane , for @xmath14 ) vanishes when @xmath20 as @xmath21 for all values of the anisotropy parameter @xmath7 . for @xmath22 and for any @xmath7",
    "the ground state is non degenerate ; while for @xmath23 it is doubly degenerate in the thermodynamical limit for any @xmath24 , signaling the breaking of the @xmath25 symmetry .",
    "the gap vanishes at the transition as @xmath26^{1/2 } \\quad\\mathrm{for}\\ ; \\gamma \\geq 1 .",

    "the deviation from the thermodynamic limit for the gap @xmath27 and the magnetization @xmath28 scale as @xmath29 for @xmath30 ( where @xmath31 is a constant ) and @xmath32 for @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the scaling behavior of the gap is important in order to distinguish the various dynamical regimes in the adiabatic annealing .",
    "it is however important to stress at this point that the equilibrium gap is not necessarily the one responsible for the loss of adiabaticity . as we will see in the following section , due to the parity conservation the relevant gap for the dynamics is different from the equilibrium one ( although with the same scaling behavior ) .",
    "the adiabatic dynamics is implemented by changing the external transverse field from an initial value @xmath33 at @xmath34 , where the ground state of @xmath35 is completely dominated by the transverse field term with all the spins aligned along the @xmath36 direction , to @xmath37 , where the ground state is ordered in the @xmath19 plane .",
    "the annealing time is characterized by a time scale @xmath0 .",
    "more specifically we consider the case , as often in this type of problems , to reduce the magnetic field linearly in time @xmath38\\ ] ] with @xmath39 .",
    "the problem we want to discuss is further simplified by the following observation .",
    "the initial state , the ground state of @xmath35 , belongs to the sector of maximum spin @xmath40 .",
    "since @xmath41 is a constant of motion it is sufficient to restrict our attention to this subspace only . from now on we assume @xmath40 ( for simplicity we consider @xmath5 even ) . in the basis @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) , the schrdinger evolution of the state @xmath44 amounts to solving the following set of coupled equations @xmath45 the odd amplitudes @xmath46 do not couple because of parity conservation . in eq.([sch_tdep :",

    "a natural way of quantifying the degree of adiabaticity of the evolution is to measure the residual energy , defined as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the ground state energy of @xmath55 , and @xmath56 is the average energy of the final time - evolved state @xmath57 .",
    "obviously @xmath58 , and hence @xmath59 , depends on the annealing time @xmath0 ; the slower the evolution the closer the final energy to @xmath54 , hence the small the residual energy .",
    "an alternative way of quantifying the degree of adiabaticity of the evolution is in terms of the incomplete magnetization in the final state , defined by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the static magnetization of the ground state of @xmath62 and @xmath61 is the average magnetization of the final evolved state .",
    "following botet _",
    "@xcite , the magnetization @xmath63 has been defined through @xmath64 where the expectation value can be taken either the ground state , for @xmath61 , or in the evolved state , for @xmath65 . as discussed in botet _",
    "@xcite , the previous definition differs from that of the spontaneous magnetization ; however , it is more amenable for finite size systems and it reduces to the spontaneous magnetization in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "since we are dealing with a model where the coupling has an infinite range , the incomplete magnetization is an appropriate way to characterize the loss of adiabaticity . in this case",
    "a correlation length characterizing the typical distance between defects , along the lines followed for short range models , can not be introduced .    in the ising limit , @xmath66 , at @xmath67 , the residual energy and the incomplete magnetization",
    "are related , as they both depend only on the average value @xmath68 : the residual energy per site can be expressed as @xmath69 the incomplete magnetization is given by @xmath70      in addition to the previous observables , it was recently shown that important information of the lack of adiabaticity in the system can be acquired by analyzing the entanglement entropy @xmath71  @xcite .",
    "the study of entropy and other measures of entanglement has been recently intensively studied to characterize both equilibrium and non - equilibrium quantum many - body systems ( see [ ] for a review ) . in the case of the lmg model",
    "the ground state entanglement entropy was studied in  @xcite . in the present work",
    "we study the time evolution of @xmath71 during an adiabatic evolution .    given a bipartition of the system in @xmath72 and @xmath73 spins the entanglement entropy associated to the reduced density matrix of one of the subsystems , say @xmath74 , is defined as @xmath75 the entropy @xmath76 measures the entanglement between the @xmath72 spins and the rest of the system .    the entanglement entropy is straightforwardly evaluated by noticing that , being the states @xmath77 symmetric under any permutations of the sites and being the maximum value of the total spin achievable only with the maximum value of the spin in each subsystem , the following decomposition holds  @xcite : @xmath78 in the previous decomposition @xmath79 and @xmath80 indicate , respectively , the number of up - spins in the system and in the partition which defines the @xmath72 sites .",
    "the coefficients appearing are defined as @xmath81 . with the knowledge of the representation of the evolved state in the basis @xmath42 and by the using previous decomposition",
    ", it is immediate to trace out the @xmath73 spins to obtain the reduced density matrix @xmath82 , and calculate its entropy .",
    "the results presented below were obtained by integrating numerically eq .",
    "( [ sch_tdep : eqn ] ) .",
    "we verified that , as for the initial time of the evolution , it is enough to consider @xmath83 for faster sweeps ( @xmath84 ) and @xmath85 for slower ones .",
    "we checked ( data not reported ) that our results do not depend on the precise value of @xmath86 .",
    "we considered systems up to @xmath87 spins and annealing times up to @xmath88 .",
    "_ residual energy and incomplete magnetization - _ in order to understand the mechanism that leads to breakdown of adiabaticity in the lmg model it is instructive to start with one particular example . in fig.[instant_lipkinl32_fig ] we chose a system with @xmath89 spins and @xmath90 , showing the time evolution of the residual energy for different values of the annealing time @xmath0 .",
    "we also plot the instantaneous _ accessible _ gaps ( thick solid lines ) obtained by diagonalizing the hamiltonian at any given @xmath8 .",
    "as one can see , as soon as the system loses the adiabaticity , for fast annealing , it starts to ramp up in energy .",
    "the characteristic time scale for breaking of adiabaticity is however not given by the equilibrium smallest gap .",
    "as noticed in the previous section , the dynamics is restricted to the subspace with fixed total spin @xmath40 and can involve only states with the same parity of @xmath91  @xcite .",
    "hence , the first gap relevant for the dynamics , that we call _ dynamical _ gap , is the energy difference between the ground state and the _ second _ excited state , the smallest gap being forbidden by parity conservation of the total spin along the @xmath92-axis . as shown in fig.[lip_crit_gaps_fig ] , the dynamical gap exhibits the same critical behavior of the excitation gap  @xcite : both close polynomially in the thermodynamical limit with the same dynamical exponent @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "this is usually accompanied by a polynomial - like decay of the residual energy with increasing annealing time @xmath0 .",
    "this is indeed the case , for both the residual energy and the incomplete magnetization , as shown in fig.[eres_mlac_gam_var_fig ] and , more in detail for @xmath66 , in fig.[e_res_vs_tau_lipkin_nlarge_fig ] .",
    "the behavior appears to be qualitatively independent on the value of the anisotropy parameter @xmath7 for @xmath95 , see fig.[eres_mlac_gam_var_fig ] ; this was expected due to the fact that the minimum gap has the same large - n behavior irrespective of the anisotropy . in the following only the case @xmath90 will be discussed .",
    "inspection of fig.[e_res_vs_tau_lipkin_nlarge_fig ] reveals three different regimes . for fast quenches",
    "the dynamics involves almost all the levels , see , e.g. , fig.[instant_lipkinl32_fig ] for @xmath96 .",
    "the residual energy per site is near to its maximum and shows very little dependence on the size of the system and on the annealing time @xmath0 . for larger values of @xmath0",
    ", a second intermediate region appears in which a power - like decay emerges , with @xmath2 .",
    "finally , by further slowing the quench rate , a third large-@xmath0 regime characterized by a different power - law , @xmath3 , emerges .",
    "we briefly discuss the emergence of the last two regimes by means of a landau - zener approach adapted to the present problem .",
    "the argument follows closely the one given in  @xcite .",
    "the probability of exciting the system into the first excited state , obtained by the landau - zener formula @xmath97 with @xmath98 , gives a lower bound to the true transition probability , as it ignore the transitions to all the other excited levels .",
    "using the scaling of the critical point gap with the number of spins , @xmath99 , it is possible to determine maximum system size for a defect - free quench once the probability for this to occur is fixed to the value @xmath100 .",
    "this gives : @xmath101 one can consider @xmath102 as an estimate of the fraction of the flipped spins after the quench .",
    "the residual energy per site in the lmg model can then be evaluated to be @xmath103 this simple estimate is in good agreement with the numerical data in the intermediate regime of fig.[e_res_vs_tau_lipkin_nlarge_fig ] .    for short range models the same power law of eq.([lz_estimate_eq ] ) can be also derived by determining the spatial scale over which defects occur  @xcite .",
    "we tried to apply the arguments of zurek _",
    "et al_@xcite to the lmg model by identifying the correlation length with the coherence number introduced in  [ ] .",
    "the procedure we followed , however , does not lead to the correct exponent .",
    "we have reasonable confidence that the failure in obtaining the correct scaling with this second method may be related to the above identification and the consequent definition of defect density .",
    "it would be interesting to find the correct argument in order to extend the approach by zurek _",
    "et al_@xcite or polkovnikov  @xcite to infinite range models .",
    "_ effective two - level approximation - _ as already mentioned before there is , for slower quenches , a further crossover to a different power - law .",
    "can one explain also this behavior by using a landau - zener argument ?",
    "to this end , it is important to refine this comparison and to understand to which extent the dynamics of a many - body system described by the lmg model can be described by two ( many - body ) levels . in general , in a many - body system there will be a number of avoided crossings and multiple lz transitions , including interference between them . only when a single avoided crossing is dominant and well separated from the others a two - level approximation is appropriate .",
    "a detailed analysis of this issue is summarized in figs.[p_gamma_l32_fig ] and  [ p_tau_bound_fig ] where we show the case of @xmath89 as an example .",
    "our analysis starts by extracting the best dynamical minimum gap and adapting to it the following two - level hamiltonian : @xmath104 in the effective landau - zener problem @xmath105 and @xmath106 are the fitting parameters and @xmath107 . in fig.[instant_lipkinl32_fig ] the dashed line represents the instantaneous gap of the hamiltonian ( [ lz_ham_eq ] ) suited to the case @xmath89 .",
    "from here we compare the results of the full lmg model with those obtained using lz theory .    as shown in fig.[p_gamma_l32_fig ] , the excitation probability in the lmg model for slow enough quenches coincides with that of the effective lz problem .",
    "it appears that this approximation is good also in the estimate of the asymptotic value of the probability for @xmath108 .",
    "deviations come predominantly from the more enhanced oscillations of the post crossing region in the lmg model . for larges @xmath0 s the asymptotic value obtained from the effective two - level system gives a very poor approximation to the actual data .",
    "this can be traced back to the presence of further crossings which are obviously neglected in the two - level approximation . in our lz scheme",
    "this can be effectively corrected by approximating the lz crossing probability to the time before the next level crossing comes into play .",
    "this is explained below as found by vitanov  @xcite , it is possible to define the duration of a single lz as the time required by the probability for jumping from zero to its asymptotic value , linearly and with the slope calculated at the crossing point . using @xmath8 as time - scale one can write : @xmath109 this time turns out to be _ exponentially _ divergent with @xmath0 for large @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "this means that for slow quenches consecutive lz transitions are not independent . in a first crude approximation",
    ", we can guess that the consequence of this is simply to stop the probability from relaxing towards the asymptotic value when the system has reached the second crossing .",
    "the presence of a power - law regime @xmath110 for extremely slow dynamics is a clear consequence of the finite duration of the evolution . in the original works by landau and by zener , the final time is supposed to be @xmath111 ; here the evolution is stopped at @xmath112 for the lmg model , and at @xmath113 for the effective lz , with @xmath114 .",
    "an accurate analysis of the finite - time landau - zener model ( ftlz ) has been done in ref .",
    "[ ] , where it is shown that the transition probability reads , in this case  @xcite : @xmath115 with @xmath116 . as it can be immediately seen from the previous equation , by sending the final time to infinity the usual lz probability is recovered .",
    "the crossover rate @xmath117 to the @xmath118 scaling is obtained by equating the two terms on the r.h.s . of eq.([vitanovlz ] ) . in the limit",
    "@xmath119 the crossover time is approximated by @xmath120 \\frac{\\omega _ { lz}}{4\\delta _ { lz}^2}\\frac{1}{(1+\\frac{\\omega _ { lz } ^2}{\\delta _ { lz } ^2}\\gamma _ { ( lz)f } ^2)^{3/2}}. \\label{crosstau}\\ ] ] in fig.[p_tau_bound_fig ] we compared the excitation probabilities of lmg systems of different sizes with their single - lz approximations .",
    "the probabilities for the effective models are evaluated for three different final time : @xmath121 , where the last two are the positions , respectively , of the minimum gap between the ground state and the second excited level , and the minimum gap between the first and the second excited levels . as it can be seen , the agreement is quite good and one can reproduce in this way also the regime with the @xmath118 behavior .",
    "_ entanglement entropy - _",
    "we finally would like to discuss the behavior of the entanglement entropy which was already used as a tool to characterize adiabatic many - body dynamics in refs .",
    "our results are summarized in fig.[ent_vs_tau_fig ] . in the left lower panel the entanglement entropy , for a block of size @xmath122 , of the state evolved down to @xmath123",
    "is plotted as function of the quench time @xmath0 .",
    "for fast quenches , @xmath124,the state does not evolve ( it remains in a nearly factorized state ) , thus the entanglement necessarily tends towards zero . for very slow dynamics @xmath125 ,",
    "since we are dealing with finite systems , the evolution eventually becomes adiabatic and the entanglement picks up the value it assumes in the final ground state , @xmath126 , independently on the subsystem size  @xcite . between this two limiting behaviors , the entropy reaches a size - dependent maximum at an intermediate value of @xmath0 .",
    "an interesting feature is that the presence of a finite minimum gap can be easily connected with a time scale for the decaying of the entanglement .",
    "a possible choice for this time scale consists in selecting the @xmath127 at which the entropy has reduced by half the value of the its peak respect to the slow quench limit @xmath128 in the upper panel of fig .",
    "( [ ent_vs_tau_fig ] ) , @xmath127 determined in this way is shown as a function of the system size @xmath5 . for large @xmath5 ,",
    "a power - like behavior emerges with an exponent @xmath129 , hinting at a relation @xmath130 in the lower right panel of fig .",
    "( [ ent_vs_tau_fig ] ) , the entanglement @xmath131 divided by its maximum value @xmath132 is plotted as a function of the rescaled variable @xmath133 , showing , for large systems ( @xmath134 ) , a collapse of all data on the same curve .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ lz_gap_relation_eq ] ) expresses exactly the same energy - time relation found in the usual lz system , see eq.([lz_formula_eq ] ) , so that the correspondence stated in previous sections is again supported .",
    "in this paper we have studied the adiabatic quantum dynamics of the lmg model in a transverse field across its quantum critical point .",
    "we focused our attention on the residual energy after the quench analyzing its behavior as a function of the annealing time , in order to evaluate the extent of diabaticity of the evolution .",
    "the dynamics is restricted to a subspace of definite total spin and parity of its projection along the @xmath92-axis , due to the symmetries of the hamiltonian .",
    "results appeared to be qualitatively independent of the value of the @xmath135-anisotropy parameter @xmath7 , except for the fully isotropic @xmath136 case at @xmath137 , where the further conservation of @xmath91 plays an important role . by starting the evolution in the ground state for very large values of the transverse field @xmath8 , and",
    "then reducing @xmath138 linearly to zero , three regimes in the residual energy are identifiable : the first one , corresponding to fast quenches , is strongly not adiabatic , involves transitions from the ground state towards many excited states and is characterized by a residual energy near to its saturation value . in the intermediate regime ,",
    "the lowest critical dynamically accessible gap starts dominating the evolution , inducing a residual energy per site that decays in a power - like manner , like @xmath139 .",
    "the third large-@xmath0 region , where the residual energy decays like @xmath118 , is understood by taking into account the presence of additional level crossings . in the effective landau - zener description we used in this paper",
    "this results in the requirement to consider a finite - time landau - zener sweep . as show by vitanov",
    "a finite - time sweep leads to a polynomial ( in @xmath0 ) contribution to the lz transition probability which is dominant for very slow sweeping rates .",
    "notice that this @xmath118 regime , usually described as the general deviation from adiabaticity deriving by the adiabatic theorem for very slow evolutions @xcite , emerges here in an alternative way through the parallelism with an effective ftlz model .",
