    "clock synchronization in wireless sensor networks ( wsn ) is a critical component in data fusion and duty cycling , and has gained widespread interest in recent years @xcite .",
    "most of the current methods consider sensor networks exchanging time stamps based on the time at their respective clocks @xcite . in a _ two - way _ timing exchange process ,",
    "adjacent nodes aim to achieve pairwise synchronization by communicating their timing information with each other . after a round of @xmath0 messages ,",
    "each node tries to estimate its own clock parameters .",
    "a representative protocol of this class is the timing - sync protocol for sensor networks ( tpsns ) which uses this strategy in two phases to synchronize clocks in a network @xcite .",
    "the clock synchronization problem in a wsn offers a natural statistical signal processing framework @xcite .",
    "assuming an exponential delay distribution , several estimators were proposed in @xcite .",
    "it was argued that when the propagation delay @xmath1 is unknown , the maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimator for the clock offset @xmath2 is not unique .",
    "however , it was shown in @xcite that the ml estimator of @xmath2 does exist uniquely for the case of unknown @xmath1 .",
    "the performance of these estimators was compared with benchmark estimation bounds in @xcite .",
    "a common theme in the aforementioned contributions is that the effect of possible time variations in clock offset , arising from imperfect oscillators , is not incorporated and hence , they entail frequent re - synchronization requirements .    in this work , assuming an exponential distribution for the network delays , a closed form solution to clock offset estimation is presented by considering the clock offset as a random gauss - markov process .",
    "bayesian inference is performed using factor graphs and the max - product algorithm .",
    "by assuming that the respective clocks of a sender node @xmath3 and a receiver node @xmath4 are related by @xmath5 at real time @xmath6 , the two - way timing message exchange model at the @xmath7th instant can be represented as @xcite @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath1 represents the propagation delay , assumed symmetric in both directions , and @xmath2 is offset of the clock at node @xmath4 relative to the clock at node @xmath3 .",
    "the network delays , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , are the independent exponential random variables . by further defining @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the model in",
    "can be written as @xmath13 for @xmath14 .",
    "the imperfections introduced by environmental conditions in the quartz oscillator in sensor nodes result in a time - varying clock offset between nodes in a wsn . in order to sufficiently capture these temporal variations , the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16",

    "clearly , similar expressions will apply to @xmath33 .",
    "the message updates in factor graph using max - product can be computed as follows @xmath34 which can be rearranged as @xmath35 where @xmath36 let @xmath37 be the unconstrained maximizer of the exponent in the objective function above , i.e. , @xmath38 this implies that @xmath39 if @xmath40 , then the estimation problem is solved , since @xmath41 . however , if @xmath42 , the solution is @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , in general , we can write @xmath44 notice that @xmath37 depends on @xmath45 , which is undetermined at this stage .",
    "hence , we need to further traverse the chain backwards . assuming that @xmath46 , @xmath37 from can be plugged back in which after some simplification yields @xmath47    similarly the message from the factor @xmath48 to the variable node @xmath49 can be expressed as @xmath50 the message above can be compactly represented as @xmath51 where @xmath52 proceeding as before , the unconstrained maximizer @xmath53 of the objective function above is given by @xmath54 and the solution to the maximization problem is expressed as @xmath55 again",
    ", @xmath53 depends on @xmath49 and therefore , the solution demands another traversal backwards on the factor graph representation in fig .",
