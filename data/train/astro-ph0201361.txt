    "the standard model for the formation of large structures in the universe predicts a hierarchical scenario in which the first generation of objects created correspond to subgalactic masses ( frenk et al .",
    "the aggregation of such objects by accretion , merging , etc .",
    ", over cosmological timescales would generate the wide variety of structures observed in the universe .",
    "mergers between two objects of similar masses destroy disks ( barnes & hernquist 1991 ) and seem to be one of the mechanisms that create ellipticals from spiral galaxies .",
    "a merger between a giant galaxy and a small satellite tends to heat and thicken the disk ( velzquez & white 1999 ) and could contribute to the growth of the bulge and an increase in the srsic @xmath0 parameter ( srsic 1968 ) moving the galaxy toward earlier types ( walker , mihos , & herndquist ( 1996 ) ; aguerri , balcells , & peletier 2001 ) .",
    "this accretion of satellites can also trigger starbursts ( mihos & hernquist 1994 ) , and produce counterrotating disks ( e.g. , thakar & ryden 1996 ) . however , there is some controversy over whether or not the observed structure in disk galaxies is compatible with the number of such mergers expected in the standard model ( toth & ostriker ( 1992 ) ; zaritsky ( 1995 ) ; weinberg ( 1997 ) ; velazquez & white 1999 ) .    the milky way and m31 are examples of bright spiral galaxies surrounded by several satellites . semi - analytic models ( kauffmann , white , & guideroni 1993 ) and numerical simulation ( klypin et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ; moore et al .",
    "1999 ) of hierarchical clustering galaxy formation predict a number of satellites an order of magnitude larger than observed in the local group .",
    "several alternatives have been proposed to solve this discrepancy .",
    "it has been suggested ( klypin et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , blitz et al . 1999 ) that these missing satellites were in the form of the compact high velocity clouds identified by braun & burton ( 1999 ) .",
    "bode et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have analyzed a warm dark matter model in which the dark matter particles have non - zero velocities ; these tend to suppress the structures on small scales . in this model",
    "small halos should be formed by fragmentation instead of by aggregation . using numerical simulations ,",
    "bode et al .",
    "show a reasonable agreement between the predictions of their model and observations on the number of satellites , the spatial distribution , and the epoch of formation .",
    "a possible reionization of the universe at high redshift could also suppress the formation of small galaxies after that epoch ( bullock , kravtsov , & weinberg ( 2000 ) ; somerville ( 2001 ) ; benson et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the existence of satellite galaxies in external systems has been known for a long time ( @xmath1 page ( 1952 ) , holmberg 1969 ) . the most complete compilation and study of such objects",
    "was conducted by zaritsky et al .",
    "( 1997 ) who presented a catalogue containing 115 satellites orbiting 69 primary isolated spiral galaxies .",
    "zaritsky et al .",
    "defined satellites as objects at projected distances @xmath2 kpc from their primaries , with differences in recessional velocity @xmath2 km s@xmath3 and at least 2.2 mag fainter than their parent galaxy .",
    "the number of catalogued satellites per system is very small ( typically 12 ) and for construction of the catalogue they should correspond to the brightest part of the luminosity function of these objects ( see pritchet & van den bergh 1999 ) . although the completeness of this catalogue is hardly understood ( see zaritsky et al .",
    "1993 ) , it can be estimated to absolute limiting magnitude m@xmath4 .",
    "zaritsky et al . , have used the catalogue to demonstrate that the halos of the primaries extend to at least 200 kpc and have masses larger than @xmath5 .",
    "other observational studies have been conducted by carignan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , who have discovered and analyzed eight dwarf galaxies orbiting the massive lenticular galaxy ngc  5084 .",
    "this group shows a nice example of one of the predictions of the standard models : i.e. , there should be a net excess of satellites in retrograde orbits because , as the numerical simulations show ( quinn & goodman 1986 ) , it is more effective for the parent galaxy to accrete the satellites in direct orbits .",
    "cote et al . (",
    "1997 ) have discovered 16 and 20 dwarf galaxies in the sculptor and the centaurus group respectively .",
    "some controversy exist about the reality of the so - called `` holmberg effect '' , i.e. , the fact that satellites tend to avoid the plane of the primary ; while zaritsky et al . , claimed the existence of the effect in their sample , carignan et al . , have not found it in their study of the ngc  5084 group .    in the study of these external satellites",
    "it is interesting to compare their properties with those observed in the local group ; this will help us to understand the theoretical models for the formation of structures in galactic halos . we are conducting an ongoing observational program which comprises broad band photometry in the optical ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 ) and infrared ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) , and in the h@xmath12 narrow band for both the parent and the satellite galaxies , taken from the compilation by zaritsky et al .",
    "the aim of this study is to determine the structure , dynamics , star formation rates , and stellar populations to constrain the age and metallicity of such systems . here",
    ", we concentrate on the morphology and structural parameters of the satellite galaxies .",
    "the observations presented here correspond to a subsample of 60 satellites taken from the compilation by zaritsky et al .",
    "this sample comprises most of the objects situated at dec @xmath13 degrees . during several runs between 1997 and 2001 we used the 0.8 m iac80@xmath14 and the 1 m ogs telescopes , the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ( int ) and the 4.2 william herschel telescope ( wht ) at the roque de los muchachos observatory , and the 2.2 m and 3.5 m telescopes at calar alto .",
    "typical exposures times were @xmath15 3090 minutes , and @xmath15 510 minutes for the 1 m class and for larger telescopes respectively . in the analysis presented here",
    ", we use the @xmath8 filter in most of the cases , although in a few cases we used the @xmath9 or the @xmath7 filter ( see below ) .",
    "the typical magnitude limit was @xmath8 @xmath16 mag / arcsec@xmath17 .",
    "the pixel size is different according to the telescope and instrument used but was typically in the range 0.30.5 arcsec .",
    "the seeing was between 1 and 3 arcsec with a typical value of 2 arcsec .",
    "we performed standard data reduction : ( bias subtraction , flat fielding correction , co - addition of images , sky subtraction , and cleaning of the remaining cosmic rays ) .",
    "the morphological type of the objects was determined by visual inspection , and this was our first criterion for classification . using the ellipse task in iraf we fitted ellipses to their isophotes and determined from these the surface brightness profile . for the bulge we used a srsic law :    @xmath18},\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 is the radial coordinate and @xmath20 is defined so that @xmath21 is the radius enclosing half of the light of this component ( capaccioli 1989 ) .",
    "the de vaucouleurs profile corresponds to the particular case @xmath22 . for the disk component we used an exponential law :    @xmath23    in total there are five free parameters to be determined , @xmath24 , @xmath0 , and @xmath21 for the spheroid and @xmath25 and @xmath26 for the disk respectively .",
    "however , we do not have photometric calibration for our images and so we could not determine the absolute brightness of each component ( characterized by the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) .",
    "the sizes of most of the galaxies analyzed in this paper are considerably larger than the seeing ( see below ) .",
    "furthermore , the effect of seeing is relevant only in the central parts of the galaxy in which bulges dominated , the gradients in luminosity usually being higher and more dramatic for srsic profiles with high @xmath0 parameter . in order to eliminate or greatly reduce the effect ,",
    "we have excluded from the fits the central few arcsec of the profile .",
    "the exact size of the region excluded depends on the size and profile of each galaxy .",
    "we have tested our procedure by changing the region excluded from the fit , in several cases making a comparison between the parameters derived with our fits and those obtained with the full treatment of the seeing ( trujillo et al .",
    "2001 ) , and found that our approach is correct .",
    "figure 1 shows grayscales image , contour plots , surface brightness profiles , and the fits of the satellite galaxies analyzed in this paper .",
    "north is up and east is to the left .",
    "the field of view depends on each case and is indicated in the contour plots . in the fits with",
    "both a spheroid and a disk , each component is also shown in the plots .",
    "table  1 presents the structural and morphological types of the objects .",
    "the columns are 1 : the name of the object ; 2 : @xmath27 the absolute magnitude in the @xmath6 band taken from zaritsky et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ; 3 : @xmath28 the projected distance in kpc between the satellite and the parent galaxy ; 4 : the filter used : 5 - 6 : @xmath29 the radius of the bulge in arcsec and kpc respectively ( we have adopted @xmath30 ) ; 7 : the @xmath0 parameter of the bulge ; 8 - 9 : @xmath31 the length scale of the disk in arcsec and kpc respectively ; 10 : b / t the bulge to total luminosity ratio computed from the structural parameters in columns 5 - 9 , and 11 : the morphological hubble type .    for the great majority of the objects it was possible to determine their morphological type .",
    "the symbols * and * * quoted in some of the cases of table 1 mean uncertain classification and signs of distortion / interaction respectively .",
    "we wish to make the following remarks on some of the individual objects :    * ngc 488c and ngc 2424b are examples of a low surface brightness galaxies without any structure .",
    "other galaxies in the sample such as ngc 4030c also have low surface brightness , but in this case there are knots .",
    "* there are a few cases of spiral edge - on galaxies in which we were not able to determine the hubble type and no satisfactory fit was found . in these cases",
    "we have classified them as s. * many galaxies ( @xmath32 % ) show signs of distortion , and at least in two cases interactions ( see below ) .",
    "* ngc 488b and ngc 2775b are examples of spiral galaxies with very distorted disks . in the case of ngc",
    "488b only the bulge was fitted .",
    "the results presented here show that satellite galaxies present a wide variety of morphological types , sizes , and brightness .",
    "the hubble types go from pure ellipticals to irregulars .",
    "about 35 objects have been classified as spiral galaxies .",
    "the largest group in the catalogue is ngc 1961 and its five satellites .",
    "all these satellites are luminous ( @xmath33 ) spiral galaxies .",
    "this group is notably different from the local group in which only m33 and lmc have magnitude in this range .",
    "the other large groups in the sample are those formed by ngc 4030 and ngc 4541 , which have four detected satellites each .",
    "this last is a notable group in which two of the galaxies show clear interaction ( see below ) , and another , ngc 4541d , shows strong asymmetries .",
    "there are two clear cases of interaction between pairs of satellites : ngc 2718a and ngc 2718b , and ngc 4541b and ngc 4541e , respectively .",
    "this is illustrated in figure 2 . in the first case",
    "the interaction shows up in the form of a bridge connecting both galaxies . in the case of the second interacting pair ,",
    "two tidal tails seem to emerge from ngc 4541b .",
    "one of them points directly to ngc 4541e and it seems clear that its origin is the interaction with this galaxy ; the other is nearly in the opposite direction and could reveal stripping from a previous orbit .",
    "the asymmetries shown by ngc 4541e could be also related with this interaction .",
    "another notable case is ngc 4030c classified as irr , in which several extended objects are surrounded by a common diffuse structure resembling a case of strong interaction or merger .    in a forthcoming paper",
    ", we will analyze the relationship between the different structural parameters , and between these parameters and the relative position and orientation of the satellites with respect to the parent galaxy .",
    "considering the possible bias , completeness , and sampling of our data set , we will also conduct a detailed comparison between the properties found in our systems and those in the local group .",
