    "continued expansion in research on physical properties of magnetically ordered crystals and films requires exploring a wide spectrum of magnetic phenomena , including magnetoelectric ones .",
    "such cross - correlated phenomena have attracted considerable attention in recent years because of novel physics and great potential for practical applications @xcite .",
    "the polarization , induced by an external magnetic field and/or magnetic ordering in conventional magnetoelectric materials and multiferroics , is usually attributed to structural changes , e.g. displacements of sublattices . along with the classic magnetoelectric mechanism caused by the direct interaction of the ferroelectric and magnetic order parameters @xcite , the mechanism of inhomogeneous magnetoelectric interactions",
    "@xcite are also actively discussed .",
    "the interaction leads to new physical effects : the appearance of improper polarization in multiferroics , the flexomagnetoelectric surface effect @xcite , and the electrical control of magnetic domain walls in films of iron garnets @xcite , etc .",
    "it is well known that the space - time inversion symmetry breakdown is a necessary condition for the existence of the linear magnetoelectric effect in a material . among many magnetoelectric materials",
    "are particularly interesting those with crystal structures which have a center of inversion ( i.e. even with respect to the spatial inversion ) and with magnetic structures which are odd with respect to the space and time . there",
    "exist quite a lot of such magnetic materials with the antiferromagnetic ordering , for example , the classical magnetoelectric cr@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "in this context , very interesting are rare - earth orthoferrites refeo@xmath1 in which there are two magnetic subsystems constituted by iron and rare - earth ions .",
    "the magnetic structure of the iron subsystem is even relative to the spatial inversion @xcite , thus the linear magnetoelectric effect in it is forbidden by the symmetry .",
    "indeed , in yfeo@xmath1 , lafeo@xmath1 , and lufeo@xmath1 , in which there is the only iron sublattice , the linear magnetoelectric effect is not observed .",
    "it is also not observed in other rare - earth orthoferrites at high temperatures when the rare - earth subsystem is disordered , being actually paramagnetic , and therefore spatially even .",
    "but , magnetically driven ferroelectricity was observed recently in electropoled orthochromites and is possible in isostructural orthoferrites as well @xcite .",
    "the situation changes drastically when the temperature is lowered to the critical point of the rare - earth subsystem magnetic ordering and below it ( @xmath2 15 k ) . in this case",
    ", the magnetic symmetry allows the existence of the linear magnetoelectric effect . the exchange interaction between the rare - earth and iron sublattices results in the crystal spontaneous electric polarization , i.e. at low temperatures these materials are multiferroics @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon and other attendant effects were observed in dyfeo@xmath1 @xcite , gdfeo@xmath1 @xcite , smfeo@xmath1  @xcite , etc .",
    "the key factor for such a behaviour is the presence of an antisymmetric ( odd with respect to the space inversion ) magnetic sublattice . from this point of view , very interesting are crystals of garnet structure with rare - earth sublattices .",
    "a family of garnets provides a fascinating field of science and technology because of versatile functions that could be attained by introducing different ions @xcite .",
    "studies of several years show @xcite that doping , creation of thin films , multilayer structures and composites based on yttrium iron garnet leads to strengthening a number of effects , as well as to the discovery of fundamentally new phenomena in these materials @xcite .",
    "it is reported @xcite on the finding of the large magneto - capacitance effect in yttrium iron garnet , characterized by magnetically tunable quantum paraelectricity .",
    "the electric - dipole can be hosted by the impurity like fe@xmath3 site , where the spin - orbit interaction governs the quantum - mechanical relaxation process in response to the external magnetic field or the magnetization vector .    despite the significant value of the magnetoelectric effect in garnets @xcite",
    ", these materials are non - traditional materials towards magnetoelectricity .",
    "still unsolved remains the question on the nature of the first - order effect in yttrium iron garnet , observed @xcite by applying an electric field during cooling .",
    "such emergence of the first - order magnetoelectric effect conflicts the crystal symmetry of yttrium iron garnet .",
    "meanwhile , there are known several garnets of odd magnetic structures with respect to spatial inversion , for example , the most investigated dysprosium - aluminium garnet .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate single - crystal garnets and garnet films as well by means of the symmetry and quantum mechanical combined analysis , which allows to reduce some of the uncertainties inherent in purely point symmetry analysis .",
    "we show that despite the antisymmetric magnetic structures in garnet crystals the linear magnetoelectric effect in most of them is not realized , therefore the condition of the magnetic subsystem antisymmetry is only a necessary condition for the effect to exist , not sufficient one .",
    "nevertheless , in some garnets , for example , in mn@xmath1al@xmath0si@xmath1o@xmath4 , the existence of the linear magnetic effect is possible .",
    "we also show , that other new odd effects can be observed in garnets , namely , a piezoelectric effect induced by a magnetic field in nd@xmath1ga@xmath5o@xmath4 , a piezomagnetic effect in dy@xmath1al@xmath5o@xmath4 , etc .",
    "we have also revealed an interesting feature of some garnets such as dy@xmath1al@xmath5o@xmath4 or ho@xmath6y@xmath7fe@xmath5o@xmath4 with rare - earth ions of ising type .",
    "we show that magnetic fields induce electric dipole moments directly in the @xmath8-electronic shell of a rare - earth ion and form in the materials fascinating antiferroelectric structures , though the polarization of the materials is zero on a macroscopic scale .",
    "but for all that , the magnetic structure of the garnets remains antisymmetrical .",
    "a strong enough magnetic field destroys the antisymmetric structures , converting them to ferromagnetic ones . in this case",
    "all of the above mentioned magnetoelectric effects disappear .",
    "this also applies to dysprosium iron garnet ( @xmath9 koe ) .",
    "an interesting situation takes place in epitaxial films of mixed garnets r@xmath10r@xmath11m@xmath5o@xmath4 , where r@xmath12 and r@xmath13 stand for different rare - earth ions and @xmath14 denotes al or fe .",
    "the uniform distribution of the rare - earth ions by their nonequivalent positions in the unit cell of the crystal in this case is disturbed , which results in the electric polarization occurrence in them .",
    "another possible source for the linear magnetoelectric effect to arise in a bulk crystal is a spatial inhomogeneity of an external magnetic field or internal magnetic fields on domain boundaries .",
    "the latter inhomogeneity can be a source of magnetoelectricity for nanostructures and domain boundaries of the both neel and even bloch types , not requiring the dzyaloshinskii - moria mechanism .",

    "the magnetoelectric hamiltonian and the expression for the effective electric dipole moment operator of rare - earth ions in garnets are obtained in section [ sec3 ] .",
    "section [ sec4 ] deals with the symmetry analysis of the possible magnetic modes in garnets .",
    "on the basis of the analysis we discuss the possibility of the linear magnetoelectric and other odd effects existence in a single crystal ( section [ sec4 ] ) , describe the antiferroelectricity induced by magnetic field ( section [ sec5 ] ) , and demonstrate the possibility of the linear magnetoelectric effect in an inhomogeneous magnetic field in bulk crystals ( section [ sec6 ] ) .",
    "finally , we depict the magnetoelectric effect in epitaxial garnet thin films owed to the non - equal occupancies of the ion @xmath15-positions in a primitive crystal cell by rare - earth ions ( section [ sec7 ] ) .",
    "garnet crystals r@xmath1m@xmath5o@xmath4 , where r stands for a rare - earth or yttrium ion and m stands for a metal ion ( such as fe@xmath16 , al@xmath16 , ga@xmath16 , etc . ) , have a complicated cubic crystallographic structure , described by the o@xmath17 space group . while a primitive cell contains four r@xmath1m@xmath5o@xmath4 units , a unit crystal cell contains eight of them .",

    "during the last decade , the revival of a magnetoelectric effect has passed before our eyes the stage of renaissance and now turned into the very real boom .",
    "garnets , as non - traditional materials towards magnetoelectricity , have been beyond the mainstream of the intensive research .",

    "<S> the magnetoelectricity of garnets is considered by means of a symmetry and quantum mechanical combined analysis . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown , that the magnetoelectric effect is not realized in most garnets although the necessary condition of the crystal magnetic structure antisymmetry in them is held at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the effect can be observed in some garnets as well as other odd effects , namely , piezomagnetic effect , magnetic field evoked piezoelectric one , etc . </S>",
    "<S> it is also discovered that magnetic fields can induce specific antiferroelectric structures in garnet crystals and produce electric polarization in epitaxial films . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization can also be caused in a bulk crystal by an inhomogeneous magnetic field . </S>"
