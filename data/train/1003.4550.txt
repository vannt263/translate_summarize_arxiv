    "if one now assumes that the mean curvature @xmath8 is a non - zero constant , then any spacelike surface constructed by circles in parallel planes in minkowski space is necessarily a surface of revolution @xcite ( in euclidean space , the analogous result was proved by nitsche in @xcite ) .    in this work",
    "we extend these results in a more general setting .",
    "we study spacelike surfaces that satisfy a relation of type @xmath9 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the principal curvatures of @xmath10 respectively , and @xmath2 and @xmath3 are constants .",
    "we say that @xmath10 is a _ linear weingarten surface_. as particular cases , this class of surfaces contains the umbilical surfaces when @xmath11 and the surfaces with constant mean curvature if @xmath6 .",
    "linear weingarten surfaces belong to a wider class of surfaces called weingarten surfaces .",
    "a weingarten surface is a surface that satisfies a smooth relation of type @xmath12 .",
    "equation ( [ w1 ] ) describes the simplest case of function @xmath13 , that is , that @xmath13 is linear in its variables . in euclidean space ,",
    "weingarten surfaces are the focus of interest for many geometers , beginning in the fifties with works by hopf , chern and hartman among others . in minkowski space ,",
    "weingarten surfaces have been studied in @xcite .",
    "the relation ( [ w1 ] ) in euclidean space has been considered in @xcite .    in the first part of the work , we consider linear weingarten surfaces foliated by a uniparametric family of circles in parallel planes . as we have previously said , for the particular case that @xmath14 , that is , @xmath15 , there exist examples of non - rotational surfaces .",
    "we ask for the existence of examples of non - rotational surfaces foliated by circles in parallel planes that satisfy the general relation ( [ w1 ] ) . we prove :    [ t1 ] let @xmath10 be a spacelike surface in @xmath0 foliated by circles in parallel planes . if @xmath16 is a linear weingarten surface , then @xmath10 is a surface of revolution or the surface is part of the family of riemann examples of maximal surfaces .",
    "thus , if the surface is not rotational , then necessarily @xmath15 and the surface is one of the riemann examples .",

    ", @xmath51 is the hyperboloid of two sheets .",
    "so , if @xmath52 is the origin of coordinates , @xmath53 satisfies the equation @xmath54 which is obtained by rotating the hyperbola @xmath55 in the plane @xmath56 with respect to the @xmath57-axis .",
    "this surface is spacelike with mean curvature @xmath58 and with gauss curvature @xmath59 .",
    "moreover it is an umbilical surface and so , it is a linear weingarten surface .",
    "we now describe the surfaces of revolution of @xmath17 .",
    "we study those rigid motions of the ambient space that leave a straight - line @xmath60 pointwised fixed . depending on the axis @xmath60 , there are three types of rotational motions . after an isometry of @xmath17 ,",

    "in particular , there exists a planar curve @xmath65 that generates the surface , that is , @xmath10 is the set of points given by @xmath66 . because in this paper we are interested for spacelike surfaces , the generating curve @xmath67 of the surface must be spacelike .",

    "the surface of revolution generated by @xmath67 is @xmath90    given a family of rotational motions , if we look the orbit that describes a point of @xmath91 under the motions of this family , we will obtain a planar curve that plays the role of a circle in @xmath17 . from the above , and taking into account what happens in euclidean ambient space ,",
    "we give the definition of a spacelike circle in minkowski space @xmath17 .",
    "an orbit of a point under one of the above three groups of rotations of @xmath17 parametrized by a spacelike curve is called a spacelike circle .    from now on ,",
    "we say simply circle instead of spacelike circle .",
    "after a rigid motion of @xmath17 , there are three types of circles , which can viewed as euclidean ( horizontal ) circles , ( vertical ) spacelike hyperbolas and spacelike parabolas .",

    "in this section we prove theorem [ t1 ] . we consider a spacelike surface @xmath128 parametrized by circles in parallel planes . in the proof of the theorem",

    ", @xmath138 ( the axis of revolution would be the straight line @xmath139 ) .",
    "the proof is by contradiction .",
    "this means that the planar curve @xmath140 is not constant , that is , @xmath86 is not a single point and we reparametrize @xmath67 by the arc - length , and thus @xmath141 .",
    "then there exits a smooth function @xmath142 such that @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "in fact , @xmath145 is the curvature @xmath146 of @xmath67 .",
    "equation ( [ 5 ] ) is an expression of type @xmath147 because the family of functions @xmath148 are independent linear , the coefficients @xmath149 and @xmath150 must vanish in all its domain .",

    "the computation of @xmath153 and b@xmath154 gives respectively : @xmath155 since @xmath156 , we obtain @xmath157 : contradiction . therefore , the proof for spacelike planes reduces to consider that @xmath7 in the relation ( [ w1 ] ) .",
    "then the equation ( [ 5 ] ) is @xmath158 and the sum in ( [ 6 ] ) is until @xmath159 , with @xmath160 as @xmath161 and @xmath48 , from @xmath162 we obtain @xmath163 .",
    "this means that the curve @xmath67 is a straight - line and @xmath164 is a constant function .",

    "assume @xmath176 .",

    "in particular , @xmath6 , which it was discarded at the beginning of this section . this contradiction shows the result .      after a motion in @xmath17 we may assume the foliating planes are parallel to @xmath209 . recall that now a circle is a parabola whose axis is parallel to the vector @xmath210 .",
    "if the surface is rotational , the vertex of the parabolas @xmath211 in ( [ rot3 ] ) is given by @xmath86 .",
    "however , in the case that the surface is not rotational , we allow that this vertex belongs the plane @xmath212",
    ". then the surface is parametrized by @xmath213 where @xmath214 and @xmath215 are smooth functions .",
    "the surface @xmath10 will be rotational if the function @xmath216 is constant .",
    "the equation ( [ 5 ] ) writes now as @xmath217 for smooth functions @xmath218 .",
    "if we look ( [ light ] ) as polynomial on @xmath42 , then all coefficients @xmath219 vanish .",
    "assume first that @xmath152 .",
    "then @xmath220 means @xmath221 and so , @xmath222 , that is , @xmath214 is a constant function .",
    "suppose now @xmath7 in the relation ( [ w1 ] ) .",
    "now we use ( [ 5 ] ) and the sum ( [ light ] ) is now until @xmath223 .",
    "we have @xmath224 we assume that @xmath225 ( the reasoning with @xmath226 is similar ) . if @xmath214 is not a constant function , then @xmath227 , with @xmath29 .",
    "putting now in @xmath171 we have @xmath228 as @xmath229 , we obtain a value of @xmath230 , which substituted into @xmath203 gives @xmath231 and so , @xmath232 .",
    "thus ( [ p1 ] ) implies now @xmath233 : contradiction . as conclusion",
    ", @xmath234 is a constant function .",
    "in this section we study rotational spacelike surfaces that satisfy the relation ( [ w1 ] ) . due to the complexity in the general case , and the impossibility to obtain a complete integration of this equation , we focus in ( [ w1 ] ) when @xmath7",
    ". then the weingarten relation writes as @xmath235 we distinguish the classification according the causal character of the axis of revolution .",
    "assume that the axis of revolution is timelike . according to ( [ rot1 ] ) , we parametrize the surface as @xmath236 , with @xmath237 .",

    "for example , for @xmath254 and letting @xmath255 , we have :        we assume from ( [ rot2 ] ) that the surface parametrizes as @xmath25 , with @xmath237 . equation ( [ n0 ] ) writes as @xmath259 letting @xmath244 and @xmath260 as new dependent and independent variables , respectively , we only take the first equation in ( [ s1 ] ) , since the second one is the analogous for @xmath239 .",
    "then it transforms into @xmath261 a first integration leads to : @xmath262 for some positive constant @xmath263 , or equivalently , @xmath264 again , the solutions are given in terms of hypergeometric functions .",
