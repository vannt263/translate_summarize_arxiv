    "this suggests that the progenitors of both grbs and xrfs are related to the death of massive stars and xrfs are the low energy extension of the more `` standard '' grbs .",
    "some empirical relations have been discovered from typical grbs .",
    "it is interesting to verify whether xrf 060218 satisfies these relations as an approach to access its `` standardness '' .",
    "it has been reported that xrf 060218 complies with the isotropic energy vs. spectral peak energy ( @xmath3 ) relation derived from long grbs ( amati et al .",
    "2002 ) and other xrfs ( amati et al . 2006 ) .",
    "the pulses in grb light curves usually display a fast - rise - exponential - decay ( fred ) shape and it has been found that the pulse width is related to the energy of the observational band as @xmath4 ( fenimore et al . 1995 ; norris et al . 2005 ) .",
    "a correlation between the isotropic luminosity and the spectral lag ( @xmath5 relation ) of light curves was also discovered with typical grbs as @xmath6 ( norris et al .",
    "both @xmath7 and @xmath5 relations are related to the structure of light curves .",
    "since most photons of an xrf are in the x - ray band , previous grb missions did not observe the real light curves of xrfs .",
    "this makes it difficult to identify the temporal structure and the spectral lag of xrfs .",
    "xrf 060218 is long and soft , and _ swift _ bat and xrt simultaneously collected the data in the gamma - ray to x - ray bands .",
    "this makes it possible to measure its temporal structure and to examine whether it complies with the same @xmath7 and @xmath5 relations derived from grbs . in this _",
    "letter _ we focus on this issue . throughout the paper @xmath8 km",
    "s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are adopted .",
    "xrf 060218 was detected with the _ swift_/bat on 2006 february 18.149 ut .",
    "it is a long burst , with a duration @xmath12 seconds in the 15 - 150 kev band .",
    "swift slewed autonomously to the burst and the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) and uv / optical telescope ( uvot ) began collecting data 159 s after the burst trigger .",
    "xrf 060218 was an image trigger .",
    "the bat event data lasted only until @xmath13 seconds after the trigger .",
    "the survey data are used to derive the bat light curve .",
    "xrf 060218 is very soft , with most of the emission in the bat band being lower than 50 kev ( campana et al .",
    "2006 ) . in order to obtain a high level of signal - to - noise ratio of the bat light curve , we use the light curve in whole bat band , i.e. , 15 - 150 kev .",
    "the first orbit of the xrt data is fully in the windowed timing ( wt ) mode .",
    "we extract the light curves and spectrum of the xrt data with the xselect package .",
    "the spectrum is grouped with the tool _ grppha _ , and the spectral fitting is carried out with the _ xspec _ package . following campana et al .",
    "( 2006 ) we fit the xrt spectrum in the first orbit with a model combining a black body component with temperature @xmath14 and a cut - off power law ( @xmath15 ) component .",

    "1990 ) for this burst is @xmath16 @xmath17 and the grb host galaxy ( @xmath18 ) is incorporated .",
    "we obtain @xmath19 @xmath20 , @xmath21 kev , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 kev ( corresponding to @xmath24 kev ) , with reduced @xmath25 for 769 degrees of freedom .",
    "we derive the unabsorbed light curves in the 0.3 - 2 kev , 2 - 5 kev , and 5 - 10 kev bands from the xrt data . as reported by campana et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , a thermal component exists , and is likely of different origin ( e.g. the shock breakout emission associated with sn 2006aj ; c.f .",
    "li 2006 ; ghisellini et al .",
    "2006b ) from the non - thermal component .",
    "we therefore subtract the contribution of this component from the observed light curves .",
    "the @xmath14 and the radiation radii ( @xmath26 ) evolve with time during the first orbit .",
    "we read the values of @xmath14 and @xmath26 from campana et al.(2006 ) and calculate the light curves of this component in 0.3 - 2 , 2 - 5 , and 5 - 10 kev bands .",
    "since the temperature of the black body component is below @xmath27 kev , the light curves in the energy band higher than 2 kev is essentially not contaminated by the thermal component . in the 0.3 - 2 kev band ,",
    "the derived light curve of the thermal component continuously increase with time , which could be well fitted by @xmath28 in cgs units .",
    "we thus subtract the contribution of this component from the 0.3 - 2 kev band light curve according to this fitting result .",
    "the derived non - thermal light curves in the three xrt bands as well as the one in the bat band are shown in fig.[lc](a ) . to clearly view the pulse width and spectral lag dependences with energy , we also plot in fig.[lc](b )",
    "the normalized lightcurves .",
    "the characteristics of the light curves along with the average photon energy ( @xmath29 ) of each energy band are reported in table 1 .",
    "one important question is whether the xrt non - thermal emission and the bat emission are of the same origin . in order to clarify this we first study the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the burst using joint bat - xrt data .",
    "since this event is image trigger , the bat event file contains only the data in the first 300 seconds since the bat trigger .",
    "xrt began collecting data 159 seconds after the bat trigger .",
    "we thus only obtain simultaneous observations of the two instruments from 160 to 300 seconds with the event files .",
    "the joint - fit sed in this period is shown in fig.[sed ] , which is well fitted by the bb+cpl model ( campana et al .",
    "2006 ) with the following parameters : @xmath30 @xmath20 , @xmath31 kev , @xmath32 and @xmath33 kev ( corresponding to @xmath34 kev ) , with reduced @xmath35 for 327 degrees of freedom .",
    "the @xmath1 strongly evolves with time , from @xmath36 kev at the beginning down to @xmath37 kev at later times .",
    "this is consistent with that reported by campana et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and ghisellini et al .",
    "( 2006a ) .",
    "the model fitting results are shown in fig.[sed ] .",
    "one can observe that the bat - component is a good extrapolation of the xrt non - thermal component .",
    "this result implies that the non - thermal emissions detected by xrt and bat are of the same origin .      as shown in fig.[lc ] , the light curves in different energy bands can be all modeled by a single fred - pulse .",
    "kocevski et al .",
    "( 2003 ) developed an empirical expression to fit a fred - like pulse , which reads , @xmath38^{-\\frac{r+d}{r+1}},\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the time of the maximum flux ( @xmath40 ) , @xmath41 is the offset time , and @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the rising and decaying power - law indices , respectively .",
    "we fit the light curves with eq.([kocevski ] ) and then measure the pulse width , rising and decaying times at the full - width half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the fitting light curves , and the rising - to - decaying time ratio ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the errors of these quantities are derived from simulations by assuming a normal distribution of the errors of the fitting parameters .",
    "the reported errors are at @xmath45 confidence level .",
    "the results are tabulated in table 1 .",
    "we show @xmath46 as a function of @xmath29 in fig.[fwhm_lag](a ) . apparently the two quantities are correlated . a best fit yields @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath44 parameter ranges from @xmath48 to 0.59 .",
    "it is found that xrf 060218 roughly satisfies the same @xmath49 relation ( fenimore et al .",
    "1995 ; norris et al . 2005 ) and its @xmath44 values are also well consistent with that observed in typical grbs ( e.g. norris et al .",
    "1996 ; liang et al .",
    "2002 ) , although it has a much longer pulse width than other single - pulse grbs .",
    "these results imply that xrf 060218 may be an extension of grbs to the extremely long and soft regime .",
    "the light curves shown in fig.[lc](a ) display a significant spectral lag ( @xmath50 ) , with soft photons lagging behind the hard photons , as usually seen in long grbs ( norris et al .",
    "2000 ; yi et al .",
    "we illustrate this lag behavior with the intensity - normalized light curves in fig.[lc](b ) . the light curves peak at @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 seconds , respectively , in a sequence of high energy band to low energy band as shown in fig . [ fwhm_lag](b ) .",
    "the best fit to the correlation between the peak time ( @xmath55 ) and the average photon energy yields , @xmath56 a simple estimate of the lags between any pairs of the 4 light curves obtains @xmath57 seconds , being consistent with that shown in gehrels et al .",
    "we note xrf 060218 becomes the new record - holder of the long - lag , wide - pulse grbs .",
    "the previous record holder was grb 971208 , with @xmath58 seconds and @xmath59 seconds ( norris et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "we also calculate the lags with the cross correlation function ( ccf ) method .",
    "the errors of lags are evaluated by simulations .",
    "the results are also reported in table 1 .",
    "the lag derived by the ccf method ( @xmath60 ) is strongly correlated with @xmath61 , but is systematically lower from the peak of the ccf without considering the side lobe contribution of the ccf .",
    "a fit to the ccf with a cube or quartic function gives a larger lag by considering the side lobe contribution ( norris et al .",
    "however , this method strongly depends on the artificially - selected range of ccf for the fitting",
    ". since the light curves are a smooth pulse and their lags are significantly larger than the time bin , the peaks of ccfs are robust to estimate the lags . ] than @xmath62 [ fig .",
    "[ liso_lag](a ) ] .",
    "a best fit gives @xmath63 .",
    "the @xmath5 relation was discovered with six bright batse grbs ( norris et al .",
    "2000 ) and the spectral lag was defined by the light curves in the 25 - 50 kev and 100 - 300 kev bands .",
    "we investigate whether the lag behavior of xrf 060218 is consistent with the @xmath64 relation .",
    "since xrf 060218 is a soft xrf and the emission in the 100 - 300 kev band is too weak to derive a light curve , we assume that @xmath65 of the light curve in the 100 - 300 kev band follows the @xmath66 relation ( eq.[t_e ] ) and perform the extrapolation . with the extrapolated @xmath65 we then estimate @xmath67 for the light curves in the 25 - 50 kev ( average energy 30 kev ) and 100 - 300 kev ( average energy 200 kev ) bands . we obtain @xmath68 seconds .",
    "since @xmath60 is more reliable , we use the @xmath69 relation [ fig .",
    "[ liso_lag](a ) ] to derive @xmath70 seconds .",
    "this lag is used in the @xmath71 relation analysis .",
    "using the peak fluxes in the bat and xrt band , we estimate @xmath72 ergs s@xmath9 .",
    "figure [ liso_lag](b ) shows the @xmath73 relation derived by norris et al .",
    "( 2000 ) compared against xrf 060218 as well as two other nearby grbs , 980425 and 031203 .",
    "the data of the previous grbs are taken from norris et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and sazonov et al .",
    "( 2004 ) s are recalculated with the cosmological parameters used in this paper . ] .",
    "the grey band and the two dashed lines mark the best fits at the @xmath45 and @xmath0 confidence level , respectively , and the solid line is the regression line for the 6 grbs that were used to draw the @xmath71 correlation , i.e. @xmath74 ( errors are at the @xmath45 level ) .",
    "we can see that xrf 060218 is definitely inside the @xmath0 region and is marginally at the @xmath45 region boundary .",
    "therefore , the hypothesis that xrf 060218 follows the @xmath71 relation can not be ruled out at the @xmath0 significance level .",
    "we caution that the @xmath50 is inferred from the extrapolation of the @xmath75 relation .",
    "this introduces uncertainties in deriving the lag .",
    "the other two nearby grbs , 980425 and 031203 , are out of the @xmath76 region , which are identified as significant outliers of this relation ( e.g. sazonov et al .",
    "we have investigated the non - thermal emission of xrf 060218 .",
    "the early sed of this event from 0.3 - 150 kev observed by bat and xrt suggests that the non - thermal emission detected by the two instruments are the same component . by subtracting the contribution of the thermal emission",
    "we derive the light curves of the non - thermal emission .",
    "they are composed of a broad single pulse , and the energy dependences of the widths and the rising - to - decaying - time ratio of the pulses are roughly consistent with those derived in typical grbs .",
    "the light curves show significant spectral lags , with a well - defined peak time sequence from high energy band to low energy bands , i.e. @xmath77 .",
    "we infer the spectral lag in the batse bands and find that the hypothesis that this event complies with the @xmath5 relation with typical grbs can not be ruled out at the @xmath0 significance level .",
    "these intriguing facts , along with its compliance with the amati - relation , strongly suggest that grb 060218 is a `` standard '' burst at the very faint , long , and soft end of the grb distribution .",
    "since all these relations concern the temporal and spectral properties of emission , they are likely related to the radiation mechanisms .",
    "the results therefore imply that xrf 060218 and other xrfs may share the similar radiation physics ( e.g. synchrotron or inverse compton scattering in internal shocks , mszros , 2002 ; zhang & mszros 2004 ; piran 2005 ; mszros 2006 ) with harder grbs .",
    "as discovered by norris ( 2002 ) , the proportion of long - lag bursts within long - duration bursts increases from negligible among bright batse bursts to @xmath78 at the trigger threshold , and their peak fluxes are @xmath79 orders of magnitude lower than those of the brightest bursts .",
    "this argues that they are intrinsically under - luminous .",
    "taken together with the fact that three nearby grbs , 980425 , 031203 , and 060218 , are long - lagged and under - luminous , an intuitive speculation is that long - lag bursts are probably relatively nearby ( e.g. , norris et al . 2005 )",
    ". the local grb rate of these grbs thus should be much higher than that expected from the high luminosity grbs ( liang et al .",
    "2006 ; see also cobb et al .",
    "2006 ; pian et al . 2006 ; soderberg et al .",
    "a possible scenario to explain their wide - pulse , long - lag , and under - luminous features is the off - axis viewing angle effect ( e.g. nakamura 1999 ; salmonson 2000 ; ioka & nakamura 2001 ) .",
    "another scenario is that these features are intrinsic , being due to their lower lorentz factors ( kulkarni et al .",
    "1998 ; woosley & macfadyen 1999 ; salmonson 2000 ; dai et al .",
    "2006 ; wang et al .",
    ". they might be from a unique grb population ( liang et al .",
    "2006 ) having a different type of central engine ( e.g. neutron stars rather than black holes ) from bright grbs ( e.g. mazzali et al . 2006 ; soderberg et al .",
