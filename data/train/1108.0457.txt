    "measurements of anisotropic flow in heavy - ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , continue to play a central role in ongoing efforts to characterize the transport properties of the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) produced in these collisions . recently",
    ", considerable attention has been given to extractions of the specific viscosity @xmath4 [ the ratio of viscosity ( @xmath5 ) to entropy density ( @xmath6 ) ] via elliptic flow ( @xmath7 ) measurements .",
    "these extractions indicate a range of 1 - 2 times the conjectured lower bound @xcite for @xmath4 , ( _ i.e. _ @xmath8 ) .",
    "this large uncertainty ( 100% ) is known to be dominated by the uncertainty in model estimates of the initial eccentricity @xcite .",
    "thus , a more precise extraction of @xmath4 requires the development of new experimental constraints .",
    "because of the acoustic nature of flow ( _ i.e. _ it is driven by pressure gradients ) , a transparent way to evaluate the strength of dissipative effects , is to consider the attenuation of sub - horizon sound modes in the plasma . in the presence of viscosity ( @xmath5 ) , sound intensity",
    "is exponentially damped as : @xmath9 @xcite , where the spectrum of initial ( t = 0 ) perturbations of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath10 , can be associated with the harmonics of the shape deformations and density fluctuations of the collision zone ; @xmath11 is the wave number for these harmonics , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the expansion time and the temperature of the plasma respectively . since viscous damping scales as @xmath14 the viscous corrections for the eccentricity driven harmonics @xmath0 ( with wavelengths @xmath15 for @xmath16 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath17 ) , are expected to scale as @xmath18 ; @xmath19 is the transverse size of the collision zone and @xmath20 is the knudsen number @xcite .",
    "the latter is often used to parametrize viscous corrections . the length scale @xmath21 or _",
    "`` viscous horizon '' _ separates the sound wavelengths which are effectively damped out , from those which are not , and @xmath22 is linked to the order ( @xmath23 ) of the highest harmonic which survives viscous damping .",
    "thus , the relative magnitudes of the higher - order harmonics ( @xmath24 ) are expected to provide additional constraints on both the magnitude of @xmath4 and the `` best '' model for eccentricity determinations @xcite . here",
    ", we report new @xmath0 measurements @xcite and investigate their utility as constraints for precision extraction of @xmath4 .",
    "the results presented are derived from @xmath25 au+au events obtained during the 2007 rhic running period .",
    "the fourier coefficients @xmath0 were obtained via ( i ) pair - wise distributions in the azimuthal angle difference ( @xmath26 ) between particles with pseudorapidity separation @xmath27 and transverse momenta @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( respectively ) ; @xmath30 and ( ii ) azimuthal distributions @xmath31 of charged hadrons detected in the phenix central arms at an azimuthal angle @xmath32 , relative to event planes @xmath33 @xcite obtained with three separate detectors : beam - beam counters ( bbc ) , reaction - plane detectors ( rxn ) , and muon piston calorimeters ( mpc ) .",
    "each detector has a north ( south ) component which allows correlation studies between sub - event planes @xmath34 determined at forward ( backward ) rapidity .",
    "the absolute pseudorapidity coverage for these detectors are @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the centrality dependence of the correlation strength @xmath38 for sub - event combinations ( @xmath39 ) involving different event - plane detectors with @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "note that the order @xmath42 is chosen to account for the @xmath1-multiplet of directions ( @xmath43 ) of @xmath34 and the magnitudes for @xmath44 are consistent with zero for all centrality , @xmath42 , and @xmath45 combinations .",
    "positive sub - event correlations are indicated in panels ( a ) and ( b ) for @xmath46 , with sizable magnitudes for @xmath47 and much smaller values for @xmath48 .",
    "the negative correlation indicated in panel ( a ) is due to the well known antisymmetric pseudorapidity dependence of sidewards flow ( @xmath49 ) , as well as momentum conservation .",
    "the expected correlation between @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and that between @xmath51 and @xmath48 are confirmed in panel ( c ) ; they show that @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath48 are correlated with the reaction plane .",
    "an initial state fluctuation origin of @xmath52 [ and hence @xmath53 is well supported by the absence of a correlation between @xmath51 and @xmath52 in panel ( d ) .",
    "the absence of a correlation between @xmath51 and @xmath52 reflects the rather large fluctuations of @xmath52 about @xmath51 and gives a null value for @xmath54 measured relative to @xmath51 @xcite .     vs. @xmath55 for several centrality bins as indicated . ]",
    "figure [ fig2 ] shows a clear growth of @xmath7 from central to mid - peripheral collisions , and a near constancy of @xmath54 and @xmath56 which are strong indicators of the role of initial state fluctuations in establishing the higher harmonics .",
    "it is noteworthy that the ratios @xmath57 and @xmath58 are essentially independent of @xmath55 ( for @xmath59 gev / c ) but do increase rapidly from peripheral to central collisions .",
    "these scaling patterns have been interpreted as an indication that viscous damping for the higher harmonics follow the expected acoustic ( or @xmath18 ) scaling @xcite .",
    "interestingly , these scaling patterns are also reflected in quark number ( @xmath60 ) scaling of particle identified data .",
    "that is , @xmath61 for different particle species , plotted as a function of transverse kinetic energy @xmath62 , gives essentially a single curve as illustrated for @xmath63 in the left panel of fig .",

    "[ fig3 ] compare the centrality dependence of @xmath66 and @xmath67 with several hydrodynamical model calculations @xcite , which demonstrates an essential constraint that the data provide .",
    "panel ( a ) shows good agreement between data and calculations which employ mc - glauber and mc - kln initial eccentricities ( @xmath68 ) paired with viscosity values of @xmath69 = 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the resulting @xmath4 uncertainty ( @xmath70 ) reflect the model dependence of @xmath68 .",
    "differences between the calculations become more apparent for the higher @xmath55 selection shown in panel ( b ) , but the implied uncertainty for @xmath4 remains large .",
    "panels ( c ) and ( d ) demonstrates the utility of @xmath67 as a constraint for disentangling the effects of viscosity and initial conditions ; they indicate excellent agreement with the results from viscous hydrodynamics which employ glauber initial eccentricities and @xmath71 , and rather poor agreement with calculations which employ mc - kln initial conditions and @xmath72 .",
    "the constraining power of @xmath67 stems from the fact that viscous corrections to @xmath0 scale as @xmath73 and the two eccentricity models give similar values for @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "thus , the larger viscosity needed for agreement with the data with mc - kln eccentricities in panels ( a ) and ( b ) , leads to a significant under prediction of @xmath67 in panels ( c ) and ( d ) . in summary ,",
