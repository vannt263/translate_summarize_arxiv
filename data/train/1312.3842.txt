    "the dynamics of an elastic sphere immersed in a viscous incompressible fluid is complicated due to the coupling of the vibrational sound modes of the sphere to the dissipative motion of the surrounding fluid . in the following we investigate",
    "in particular how the translational and rotational velocity of the sphere relax to zero after a sudden impulse or twist . for simplicity",
    "we assume a no - slip condition in the coupling of solid to fluid , but the calculations can be readily extended to the case of perfect slip , or to a mixed slip - stick boundary condition . for a rigid sphere with no - slip boundary condition",
    "the decay of velocity is monotonic , but the velocity of a sufficiently flexible sphere oscillates many times about zero , before finally decaying with a positive and universal algebraic long - time tail .",
    "the frequency - dependence of both the translational and the rotational friction coefficient shows many resonances corresponding to the sound modes of the isolated sphere .",
    "the analytic form of the translational friction coefficient is so complicated that we do not give the explicit expression , but we indicate how it can be derived from a set of four linear equations for four coefficients characterizing the motion of fluid and solid .    we find that for an elastic sphere the added mass vanishes , as in the case of a permeable sphere @xcite . in general ,",
    "the added mass is defined from the high frequency behavior of the friction coefficient , as the coefficient of the behavior linear in frequency . for a rigid sphere",
    "the added mass equals one half of the displaced fluid mass @xcite,@xcite . for an elastic sphere",
    "the friction coefficient tends to a constant as the frequency tends to infinity in the upper half of the complex plane .",
    "the constant is independent of viscosity and mass density of the fluid , but does depend on elastic constants , mass density , and radius of the sphere . at low frequency",
    "the friction coefficient depends only on fluid viscosity and sphere radius .",
    "in particular , the steady - state friction coefficient takes the stokes value .",
    "the frequency - dependent rotational friction coefficient is given by a relatively simple expression .",
    "the added moment of inertia vanishes , as in the case of a permeable sphere @xcite .",
    "again the friction coefficient tends to a constant as the frequency tends to infinity in the upper half of the complex plane .",
    "the constant is independent of the properties of the fluid , but does depend on the properties of the sphere .",
    "the steady - state friction coefficient takes the value derived by kirchhoff for a rigid sphere .",
    "this depends only on fluid viscosity and sphere radius .",
    "the velocity relaxation function follows from the equation of motion for the sphere via the hydrodynamic force and torque exerted by the fluid .",
    "the dependence on time can be calculated by numerical fourier transform of the complex admittance as a function of frequency . due to the coupling to many sound modes",
    "the motion is complicated . the sound modes of the isolated sphere consist of standing longitudinal and transverse sound waves in a sphere with free surface boundary conditions , as well as rayleigh surface modes @xcite .",
    "the jittery motion of the immersed sphere in the long - time regime can be calculated and observed , but is not easily characterized .",
    "the relevance of elasticity to the overall motion of the sphere can be measured in terms of a dimensionless parameter expressing the ratio of characteristic time scales of fluid and solid .",
    "the parameter is proportional to the sphere radius , which indicates that elasticity is particularly important in micro - hydrodynamics .",
    "it is known that continuum hydrodynamics finds application on a surprisingly small length scale @xcite .",
    "it will be of interest to study the motion of small elastic spherical particles in experiment or computer simulation . on account of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem",
    "@xcite the time - correlation function of brownian motion is proportional to the velocity relaxation function , so that the behavior found here can also be seen in brownian motion .",
    "the observation of brownian motion can therefore be used as a tool to investigate the elastic properties of suspended particles .",
    "our study is of particular relevance to soft matter physics .",
    "although young s modulus is of the order of @xmath0 pa for metals , and is more than @xmath1 pa for diamond , it can be many orders of magnitude smaller in soft matter .",
    "one can compare the characteristic time @xmath2 , defined as the ratio of the shear viscosity of the liquid to young s modulus of the solid , with a typical viscous relaxation time @xmath3 .",
    "for a soft solid the time @xmath2 can become of the order of the viscous relaxation time @xmath3 , and then elasticity must be taken into account .",
    "for equal mass density of liquid and solid the ratio of @xmath2 to viscous relaxation time @xmath3 is approximately the square of the dimensionless parameter mentioned above .    for simplicity",
    "we take the fluid to be incompressible .",
    "since in most practical applications the fluid will be water , this should be an excellent approximation . in principle , fluid compressibility can be taken into account @xcite , but at the expense of more parameters and a more elaborate calculation .",
    "we consider an elastic sphere of radius @xmath4 , immersed in a viscous incompressible fluid of shear viscosity @xmath5 and mass density @xmath6 .",
    "the flow velocity of the fluid @xmath7 and the pressure @xmath8 are assumed to satisfy the linearized navier - stokes equations @xcite @xmath9 for @xmath10 .",
    "the flow velocity @xmath11 is assumed to vanish at infinity and the pressure @xmath12 tends to the constant ambient pressure @xmath13 .",
    "the elastic displacement @xmath14 of the sphere is assumed to satisfy the linear equation of motion@xcite @xmath15 for @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the shear modulus , @xmath18 is the compression modulus , and @xmath19 is a uniform time - dependent force density applied to the sphere .",

    "( 2.1 ) is found most easily by a fourier transform with respect to time .",

    "the equations must be solved under the conditions that @xmath34 and @xmath35 tend to zero at infinity , and that the fluid velocity just outside the sphere equals the time - derivative of the displacement at the sphere surface .",
    "in addition the normal - normal and normal - tangential components of the stress tensor must be continuous at @xmath36 .",

    "the stress tensor of the solid is given by @xmath39    we choose coordinates such that the @xmath40 axis is in the direction of the impulsive applied force .",
