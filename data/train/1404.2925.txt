    "the demands of the katrin experiment require an extensive data - management system , described in sec .",
    "[ sec : apparatus : datamanagement ] .",
    "a number of strict requirements guided the fpd - system design .",
    "for example , the pinch magnet helps to complete katrin s primary mac - e filter , and the quality of the fpd - system vacuum affects the performance of the main spectrometer . here , we summarize the most important constraints on the system design , which fall into two categories : electromagnetic ( sec .",
    "[ sec : em_constraints ] ) and vacuum ( sec .",
    "[ sec : mainspec_adapt ] ) .",
    "the katrin spectrometers act as integrating high - pass filters . superconducting magnets guide electrons adiabatically along magnetic field lines , producing a flux that encounters a high electrostatic potential .",
    "electrons with energies below the threshold are reflected toward the source , while higher - energy electrons pass through the analyzing plane at the spectrometer mid - plane , are re - accelerated , and are focused onto the detector .",
    "a ceramic break , located at the downstream exit of the main spectrometer , isolates the fpd system from the retarding potential of the mac - e filter .",
    "the fpd - system pinch magnet forms a part of the mac - e filter for the main spectrometer , and provides the largest magnetic guiding field ( 6  t ) in the entire experiment .",
    "this magnetic - field maximum is located downstream of the spectrometers , rather than upstream , to reduce background . with the maximum field at the detector end",
    ", electrons reflected by the spectrometer will preferentially escape toward the source .",
    "the transverse extent of the electron flux , and therefore the detector diameter necessary to image the entire analyzing plane at the center of the main spectrometer , is determined by the source diameter and by the magnetic - field strengths at the source and at the fpd . while a small detector wafer is desirable , a shallow angle of incidence is not , as it would increase backscattering .",
    "our design therefore takes a moderate field strength , 3.3  t , as the nominal operating condition at the detector location , permitting a trade - off between backscattering and detector background .",
    "this field is provided by a second magnet , the detector magnet , about 1  m downstream of the pinch magnet ; the physical separation between magnets provides space for a calibration system ( sec .",
    "[ sec : apparatus : calibration ] ) that is independent of the main spectrometer .    with a nominal field of 3.3  t at the detector location ,",
    "a detector diameter of 90  mm is required to cover the 191-t  @xmath11 flux tube available from the source , plus a margin of 10% ; with a higher magnetic field at the detector , the source will make a smaller image on the detector .",
    "in order to ensure that the flux tube is fully contained within the vacuum system , the field axis of each magnet must lie within 5  mm of the axis of its cryostat bore .",
    "background in the 18.6-kev region of the endpoint beta - electron signal can be reduced by means of a post - acceleration electrode , whose potential boosts the signal ( and thus the region of interest ) to an energy where the fpd - system background is lower .",
    "it also allows various calibrations with a low retarding potential , such as the in - situ measurement of low - energy background electrons from the main spectrometer .",
    "this electrode fits inside the detector - magnet bore and contains the entire electron flux tube in order to avoid scattering . the detector and most of the readout electronics float at post - acceleration potential .",
    "an additional source of background for an apparatus like the fpd system , which employs strong electrostatic and magnetostatic fields in vacuum , occurs when charged particles confined within a penning trap ( a potential well along a magnetic field line ) ionize residual gas molecules , producing background particles , allowing the formation of unstable plasmas , and possibly causing electrical breakdowns  @xcite .",
    "penning traps are a geometry - dependent phenomenon , related to the configurations of both magnets and electrodes . to help avoid these traps ,",
    "the high - voltage region is surrounded by fused - silica insulation within the vacuum system . to facilitate assembly and allow pumping of the interior spaces ,",
    "this insulation is not one long tube , but a series of three shorter tubes with different diameters .",
    "each silica tube is lined with a pair of stainless - steel sleeves , defining the inner and outer surface potentials .",
    "inner surfaces are held at the post - acceleration potential while the outer surfaces are held at ground potential , confining most of the electric field within the insulator and reducing the probability of breakdowns .",
    "further efforts to eliminate penning traps must rely on field simulations , since the fields can quickly become complex for even a simple electrode - and - magnet configuration and since it is difficult ( and dangerous to the detector ) to experimentally locate penning traps .",
    "we have developed simulation software to perform this task using the robin hood method  @xcite .",
    "our model of katrin s fpd system ( fig .",
    "[ fig : detectorregionpotential ] ) consists of @xmath12 sub - elements .",
    "the computation of the charge - density profile ( fig .",
    "[ fig : detectorregioncd ] ) took @xmath13 real - time hours on the topsail cluster at the university of north carolina , which is comprised of 4160 2.3-ghz em64 t central processing units .",
    "to map penning traps , the algorithm first chooses sampling points within our region of interest and identifies the intersecting magnetic field line .",
    "the program then traverses each such field line , sampling the electric potential along the way ( fig .",
    "[ fig : detectorphiandbfield ] ) .",
    "if a potential well is found , the surrounding voxel is assigned the value of the well depth in ev ( fig .",
    "[ fig : detectorregionptmap ] ) . in the final search for penning traps , we sampled the detector region with @xmath14-@xmath15 voxels ( @xmath16 vertices ) , taking the equivalent of @xmath17 central - processing - unit  hours to compute . the resulting penning - trap map ( fig .",
    "[ fig : detectorregionptmap ] ) demonstrates that , within the sensitive region of the fpd system , there are no penning traps that would contribute to the background via penning discharge . a very weak penning trap exists between the first and second silica tubes in the high - vacuum system , and is probably responsible for the limitation of the post - acceleration potential to 12  kv without breakdown .",
    "since the fpd - system beam pipe couples to the katrin main spectrometer , it must be maintained at a pressure on the order of @xmath18 mbar or less .",
    "we modeled the pressure profile throughout the fpd - system vacuum chamber using the monte - carlo - based molflow program  @xcite , starting from a conservative estimate of @xmath19  mbarls@xmath20@xmath21 for outgassing from the interior of the vacuum system at room temperature .",
    "non - evaporable getter pumps can not be used in the fpd system due to their radioactivity , so cryopumps alone must maintain the vacuum . under these conditions , our model predicts a base pressure of @xmath22  mbar at room temperature , dominated by hydrogen from the stainless steel walls of the vacuum vessel .",
    "section  [ sec : apparatus : vacuum ] reports the pressures attained in the apparatus as built .",
    "an all - metal gate valve with dn250 flanges is placed downstream of the pinch magnet and protects the main - spectrometer and fpd vacuum systems from each other .",
    "the pneumatically operated valve closes automatically if the pressure in either system exceeds @xmath23",
    "a custom - built valve along the beam pipe connecting the main spectrometer to the fpd system allows the temporary separation of the two vacuum systems until the beam pipe can be sealed with an all - metal flange .",
    "this measure permits the systems to be decoupled for spectrometer bakeout .      .",
    "]    the fpd system s two 6-t superconducting solenoids , in separate warm - bore cryostats , were designed and manufactured by cryomagnetics , inc , of oak ridge , tennessee .",
    "figure  [ axialfieldscan ] shows the designed and measured axial fields as functions of axial position .",
    "the cryostats are made of stainless steel to minimize their radioactivity , and a vacuum system ( sec .",
    "[ sec : apparatus : vacuum ] ) and calibration equipment ( sec .",
    "[ sec : apparatus : eandgammasource ] ) are housed between the cryostats and within their bores .",

    "the silicon detector is a pixelated , 90-mm - diameter p - i - n diode with an independent readout for each of its 148  pixels , 146 of which were fully functional during commissioning .",
    "the analyzing plane of the katrin main spectrometer maps directly onto this array ; the segmentation of the detector reduces uncertainties due to variations in the analyzing potential",
    ". the requirements of ultra - high - vacuum compatibility , reliable electrical connections , and low background are jointly met through the use of a novel pogo - pin connection arrangement that isolates the electronics in a separate vacuum system and requires no ceramic carrier for the detector .",

    "the setting and monitoring of apparatus parameters is carried out in a comprehensive slow - controls system based on industrial field - point controllers , while the web - based interface for data management provides near - real - time worldwide access to the data .",
    "background contributions from cosmic rays , internal radioactivity , and the ambient @xmath10 flux are minimized through the use of a scintillator veto ; a layered pb - cu radiation shield ; components selected and assayed for low radioactivity ; post - acceleration to move the signal to an energy where the background is lower ; magnetic - field adjustability to optimize the beam image size ; and discrimination against multi - pixel events during analysis .",
    "the total background in the detector in an optimized 5.5-kev energy window , as measured in karlsruhe without post - acceleration and after offline background - reduction cuts , is @xmath32  mcps . even without post - acceleration ,",
    "this background level results in a figure of demerit that meets the system s commissioning goals , and is nearly low enough for the final katrin measurement .    in late spring of 2013 , the fpd system was successfully connected to the main spectrometer for the first commissioning phase of the katrin spectrometer - detector section .",
