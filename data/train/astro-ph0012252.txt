    "by comparing observations of galaxies in clusters at @xmath7 with those in clusters at @xmath5 , we infer that some environmental effects in clusters have influences on the evolution of the galaxies .",
    "@xcite found that clusters at @xmath7 have a high fraction of blue galaxies in comparison with nearby clusters , and subsequent works have confirmed this trend ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent observations with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) revealed details of the blue galaxies . @xcite and @xcite found that most of the blue galaxies are normal spirals with active star formation . on the other hand ,",
    "observations have shown that the fraction of so galaxies decreases rapidly with redshift in contrast with the normal spirals @xcite .",
    "these suggest that the blue normal spirals observed in high redshift clusters evolve into the non - blue so galaxies observed in nearby clusters . in fact , observations show that in distant clusters there are galaxies in post - starburst phase.@xcite",
    ". these galaxies may be the ones for which star formation activity is dying down .",
    "several mechanisms are proposed that can lead to the color and morphological transformations between galaxy classes in clusters , such as galaxy mergers @xcite , tides by the cluster potential @xcite , and tidal interactions between galaxies @xcite .",
    "one of the strongest candidates is the ram - pressure stripping proposed by @xcite .",
    "if a cluster galaxy moves through hot intracluster medium ( icm ) , it feels ram - pressure from the icm , which is given by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the icm density and @xmath10 is the relative velocity between the galaxy and the icm .",
    "if the ram - pressure becomes large enough , the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the galaxy can not be hold by the gravity of the galaxy and is swept away .",
    "numerical simulations demonstrate that in a cluster environment , the stripping is likely to occur @xcite . in particular , high - resolution three dimensional numerical simulations",
    "show that the ram - pressure stripping is so effective that it removes 100% of the atomic hydrogen content of luminous galaxies within @xmath11 yr @xcite . on the other hand , @xcite investigated the influence of ram - pressure on the star formation activity of a disk galaxy .",
    "they found that just before the atomic hydrogen content is stripped , the star formation rate increases at most a factor of 2 , but rapidly decreases on a timescale of @xmath11 yr after the stripping . after the star formation activity , which mainly occurred in the disk , ceases , the galaxy looks like a s0 galaxy in both color and morphology @xcite .",
    "hi deficient galaxies and galaxies with no strong emission - lines seen in cluster cores support the theoretical predictions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "although ram - pressure stripping alone does not explain the detailed morphological features of s0 galaxies , such as their large bulge to disk ratios or their conspicuous thick disks @xcite , it may be a principal mechanism of the transformation of spirals with active star formation into s0 galaxies with inactive star formation",
    ".    however , most of the previous studies dealt with the ram - pressure stripping of a model galaxy in a given cluster with arbitrary initial conditions .",
    "moreover , they did not take the evolution of cluster structure into account ; as will be seen in ",
    "[ sec : model ] , the structure of high - redshift clusters is different from that of nearby clusters even for the same mass . since it affects the icm density , the velocity of the galaxies , and the efficiency of ram - pressure stripping , it must be considered when we compare the theoretical models with observations of high - redshift clusters . in this paper , we investigate ram - pressure stripping in clusters at various redshifts , which grow according to a hierarchical clustering scenario ; the initial position and velocity of galaxies are given by a spherical collapse model of cluster formation . moreover , since a cluster breaks into smaller progenitors as time goes backwards , galaxies in the cluster might have been affected by ram - pressure stripping when they were in the progenitors before the present - day cluster formed .",
    "thus , we also consider the ram - pressure stripping of galaxies in these progenitors .",
    "since ram - pressure is proportional to the density of icm , the icm distribution of a cluster may be related to the evolution of the cluster galaxies feeling ram - pressure .",
    "x - ray observations of nearby clusters show that their icm distributions are generally different from their dark matter distributions .",
    "in particular , for low temperature clusters , the distributions of icm are significantly flatter than those of dark matter and the icm fraction in their central regions is small @xcite .",
    "a possible explanation of the icm distributions is that the icm has been heated non - gravitationally .",
    "in fact , @xcite indicated that the entropy of the icm in the central regions of low - temperature or less massive clusters is higher than can be explained by gravitational collapse alone , although it is not understood what heats the icm ( e.g. supernovae or agn ) and where the icm is heated , that is , outside or inside clusters .",
    "heating other than the gravity of a cluster makes the icm distribution flatter and different from the dark matter distribution .",
    "thus , we expect that the position where a galaxy suffers from ram - pressure stripping depends on whether the icm of the cluster ( or the gas accreted by the cluster later on ) has been heated non - gravitationally or not . in particular , we expect that the position where ram - pressure stripping occurs is more sensitive to the non - gravitational heating in the past . this is because a cluster breaks into progenitors or less massive clusters as time goes backwards , and because the heat required to explain the observations should have more influence on the icm distributions of the less massive clusters @xcite .",
    "therefore , ram - pressure stripping in the progenitors may tell us when the icm of present - day clusters was heated non - gravitationally ; it will be a clue to the heating sources .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in  [ sec : model ] we describe our models of the dark matter distribution and the icm distribution within clusters , the ram - pressure stripping of a radially infalling galaxy , and the evolution of cluster progenitors . in  [ sec : result ] we give the results of our calculations .",

    "thus , the velocity of the model galaxy has the redshift dependence such as @xmath168 . on the other hand , @xmath169 .",
    "therefore , the ram - pressure is almost independent of redshift or @xmath170 .    in summary , figure  [",

    "thus , the high s0 fraction may be due to the transformation of the field spiral galaxies by ram - pressure stripping .",
    "if this is the case , the transformation by stripping must be rapid .",
    "this is because the infall rate of field galaxies , most of which are blue spiral galaxies , increases with @xmath16 @xcite ; the ram - pressure stripping must convert rather part of the blue spiral galaxies into s0 galaxies in a short time . on the other hand , most of the galaxies in a poor cluster cl  @xmath182 at @xmath183",

    "it is to be noted that in a rich cluster ms  1054 - 03 at @xmath193 , most of the spiral galaxies are red @xcite .    at intermediate redshift @xmath194 , observations show that the fraction of blue galaxies in rich clusters , @xmath41 , is larger than that at @xmath5 @xcite . on the other hand , our model predicts that the fraction of galaxies affected by ram - pressure stripping increases with @xmath16 .",
    "it seems that these contradict to each other , because the ram - pressure stripping suppresses star formation in galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , as is mentioned above , the infall rate of field spiral galaxies is higher at the intermediate redshift in comparison with @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the increase of @xmath41 that occurs in galaxy clusters at the redshift may suggest that the effect of the increase of the infall rate overwhelms the effect of the ram - pressure stripping in snapshots of galaxy population , and that the increase of @xmath41 is not inconsistent with our prediction ; we predict that the for a given mass , ram - pressure stripping at the intermediate redshift is not as effective as that at @xmath174 ( figure  [ fig : m_rstvir ] ) .",
    "moreover , the average mass of the clusters observed at the intermediate redshift is expect to be smaller than that at higher redshift ( @xmath174 ) , because the clusters at the intermediate redshift are nearer to us and easier to be observed . on the other hand",
    ", observations also suggest that the star formation of the infalling galaxies are ultimately truncated in clusters at the intermediate redshift , although there is a contradiction over the way the star formation is suppressed @xcite .",
    "considering that most of the clusters observed at the intermediate redshift are fairly rich , ram - pressure stripping should be fairly effective in the clusters , although it is not as effective as that at @xmath174 ( figure  [ fig : m_rstvir ] ) .",
    "thus , our model appears to be consistent with the truncation of star formation .",
    "moreover , it is qualitatively consistent with the observed transformation of spiral galaxies into s0 galaxies in rich clusters at the intermediate redshift ( see  [ sec : intro ] ) .",
    "except for extremely massive clusters ( @xmath195 ) , figure  [ fig : m_rst ] shows that @xmath196  mpc regardless of redshift @xmath16 and the icm heating .",
    "for nearby clusters at @xmath5 , observations show that the fraction of s0 galaxies increases at @xmath197  mpc @xcite , which appears to be larger than the prediction by our ram - pressure model if the transformation into s0 galaxies is due to ram - pressure stripping .",
    "moreover , for clusters observed at @xmath198 , the fraction of blue galaxies also decreases at @xmath197  mpc @xcite .",
    "if ram - pressure stripping is the main mechanism of the transformation of blue spiral galaxies into s0 galaxies , the observations suggest that some galaxies at @xmath199  mpc have already been affected by the stripping when they were in the progenitors of the clusters before accreted by the main cluster progenitors .",
    "in fact , figure  [ fig : r_stvir ] shows that the ram - pressure stripping in progenitors is effective at least for @xmath200 if the icm is not heated non - gravitationally and it is effective for @xmath201 even if the icm is heated non - gravitationally .",
    "moreover , even if galaxies were inside the stripping radius of the main progenitor at some earlier time , some of them may have been scattered to large apocenter orbits during the merger process of cluster progenitors @xcite .    analyzing observational data of galaxies in rich clusters , @xcite investigated the star formation history of all the galaxies in the central regions of the clusters .",
    "they found that star the formation rate per galaxy mass declines more rapidly than in the field environment at @xmath202 ; it suggests the truncation of star formation in most of the galaxies .",
    "this may imply that ram - pressure stripping has been effective in the clusters or in their progenitors at least for @xmath202 , because the star formation rate of galaxies should decline after the ism , from which stars are born , is stripped .",
    "since figure  [ fig : r_stvir ] shows that the ram - pressure stripping has been effective for @xmath202 for rich clusters regardless of the non - gravitational heating , the results of @xcite are consistent with our predictions .",
    "unfortunately , because of large uncertainty , their results can not constrain the star formation rate of the galaxies in the cluster progenitors for @xmath181 .",
    "thus , we can not discuss the effect of the non - gravitational heating ( figure  [ fig : r_stvir ] ) .",
    "we have studied ram - pressure stripping of galaxies in clusters and their progenitors . in particular , we pay attention to its dependence on redshift and the mass of clusters . as a model galaxy , we consider a radially infalling disk galaxy ; the initial position and velocity are given by a spherical collapse model of structure formation .",
    "since x - ray observations show that the icm of nearby clusters is heated non - gravitationally , we also investigate the effect of the heating on the ram - pressure stripping .",
    "our main findings are the following :    \\1 . for a given redshift ,",
    "ram - pressure stripping of galaxies is more effective in more massive clusters .",
    "this is because the velocity of the radially infalling galaxy increases with the virial mass of the cluster .",
    "if ram - pressure stripping transforms spiral galaxies into s0 galaxies , our model is consistent with the observed relation between galaxy populations and cluster luminosities ( or temperatures ) .",
    "\\2 . for a given mass of clusters ,",
    "ram - pressure stripping of galaxies in the clusters is more effective at higher redshift .",
    "this is because the density of the intracluster medium increases with the redshift .",
    "in particular , at @xmath181 , most of the galaxies radially infalling into the centers of rich clusters are affected by ram - pressure stripping .",
    "the relatively high fraction of s0 galaxies and the abundance of uv - excess galaxies in rich clusters at @xmath174 may be due to the ram - pressure stripping .",
    "the non - gravitational heating reduces the effect of ram - pressure stripping for clusters with @xmath203 at @xmath5 and for those with @xmath204 at @xmath174 .",
    "however , for clusters with @xmath205 , it does not have an influence on the effect of ram - pressure stripping .",
    "if the icm ( or the gas accreted by a cluster later on ) is heated non - gravitationally at @xmath2 , ram - pressure stripping does not occur in cluster progenitors at @xmath171 , because the heat makes the icm fraction of the cluster progenitors small . on the other hand ,",
    "if the icm had not been heated non - gravitationally until @xmath5 , ram - pressure stripping occurs even at @xmath6 .",
    "i am grateful to t. yamada , m. nagashima , i. tanaka , t. kodama , t. tsuchiya , and d. a. dale for useful discussions and comments .",
