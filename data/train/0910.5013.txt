    "the standard model ( sm ) represents the best current understanding of electroweak and strong interactions of elementary particles . in recent years",
    "it has been impressively confirmed experimentally through the precise determination of @xmath0 and @xmath9 boson properties at the cern lep and the stanford linear @xmath2 colliders , and the discovery of the top quark at the fermilab tevatron @xmath10 collider .",
    "a precise measurement of @xmath1 does not only provide a further precisely known sm input parameter , but significantly improves the indirect limit on the higgs - boson mass obtained by comparing sm predictions with electroweak precision data as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ mwmhmt ]    a measurement of @xmath1 can also be extracted from a measurement of the sine squared of the weak mixing angle , @xmath11 , via the well - known relation between the @xmath0 and @xmath9 boson masses , @xmath12 .",
    "the nutev collaboration extracts @xmath1 from the ratio of neutral and charged - current neutrino and anti - neutrino cross sections  @xcite .",
    "their results differ from direct measurements performed at lep2 and the tevatron by about @xmath13  @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ mwave ] .",
    "much effort , both experimentally and theoretically , has gone into understanding this discrepancy .",
    "these efforts include studies of qcd corrections , parton distribution functions  @xcite , and nuclear structure ( see , e.  g. ,  @xcite for an overview ) .",
    "however , the impact of electroweak radiative corrections has not been fully studied yet . in the extraction of @xmath1 from nutev data , only part of the electroweak corrections",
    "have been included  @xcite . since",
    "then the complete calculation of these corrections has been made available in the literature  @xcite , but a realistic , experimental study of their impact on the nutev measurement on @xmath1 has not been performed yet .    in order to remedy this situation we calculated the complete @xmath14 contribution to neutrino ",
    "nucleon scattering including the full muon and charm - quark mass dependence , which has been neglected in previous studies . here",
    "we present first preliminary results of this new calculation with emphasis on the above - mentioned mass effects .",
    "a detailed study , also taking into account more realistic detector resolution effects , is in progress  @xcite .",
    "our calculation of the complete @xmath7 corrections to the neutral - current ( nc ) and charged - current ( cc ) @xmath6 scattering processes ( the tree - level feynman diagrams are shown in fig .  [ tree ] ) follows closely the treatment of @xmath15-channel @xmath0 and @xmath9 production at hadron colliders of  @xcite . the @xmath7 corrections consist of the full set of electroweak one  loop diagrams and real photon radiation from both the external charged fermion legs and the internal @xmath0 boson in the cc process . as usual , they exhibit uv and ir divergences .",
    "uv divergences are canceled by including the counterterms of the on - shell renormalization scheme  @xcite . by applying the two - cutoff phase - space - slicing method  @xcite , we extract the soft and collinear singularities from the real photonic corrections .",
    "we use fermion masses and a fictitious photon mass as regulators for the soft and collinear singularities .",
    "the photon mass dependence cancels in the sum of virtual and real soft - photon radiation , but mass singularities of the form @xmath16 may survive , which arise when the photon is emitted collinear with the charged fermion . in the case of final - state photon radiation , in inclusive observables these mass singularities cancel",
    ". however , mass singularities connected to initial - state photon radiation survive in general .",
    "these need to be absorbed in the parton distribution functions ( pdf ) , which can be done in analogy to gluon radiation in qcd .",
    "finally , the numerical phase space integration was done using monte carlo integration techniques based on the vegas algorithm  @xcite .",
    "after convolution with the quark pdfs , the predictions for the hadronic , electroweak ( ew ) next - to - leading order ( nlo ) cross section for @xmath17 scattering is obtained as follows ( @xmath18 ) : @xmath19 where the parton level cross section consists of the tree - level cross section , virtual , soft and collinear @xmath7 contributions ( including the pdf counterterms ) and the real hard photon radiation contribution .",
    "we performed the calculation with and without including fermion - mass effects and are considering the following two cases :    * all external fermions are considered to be massless and we only keep non - zero fermion masses as regulators of the collinear singularities . * the full muon and charm - quark mass dependence is taken into account , but light external fermions are treated as in the first case .",
    "fermion - mass effects in ew radiative corrections may not be numerically negligible in this process , since the relevant parton - level energy scale ( @xmath20 ) and the fermion masses can be of the same order of magnitude .",
    "this is illustrated below for the example of the @xmath0 self - energy correction ( @xmath21 ) to the cc process shown in fig .",
    "its contribution to the one - loop corrected matrix element at @xmath14 reads @xmath22[\\overline{u}_3 \\gamma^\\sigma ( 1-\\gamma_5 ) u_2].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the renormalized @xmath0 self energy @xmath23 being decomposed in transverse and longitudinal parts , @xmath24 , one finds the following contribution to the nlo matrix element squared ( up to terms of @xmath25 ) : @xmath26 . \\label{sew1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we consider massless fermions for the external legs ( case 1 ) , the second term in eq .   vanishes .",
    "however , for massive fermions ( case 2 ) the longitudinal two  point function contributes to the physical cross section .",
    "since we work in the feynman-t hooft gauge , we also had to include the contributions from the would - be goldstone bosons , which are not explicitly shown here . in the @xmath15-channel @xmath0 production process such as gauge - boson production in drell - yan processes at the tevatron and the lhc ,",
    "@xmath27 is replaced with @xmath28 , so that the second term is usually negligible . in @xmath29-channel deep inelastic scattering",
