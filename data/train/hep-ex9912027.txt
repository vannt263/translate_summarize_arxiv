    "it has now been firmly established that the photon can interact strongly , as though it were a hadron . indeed , two of the first physics results to be published by the hera experiments h1 and zeus were the measurements of the total photoproduction cross section  @xcite .",
    "these confirmed the cross section of the photon to be of order 100  @xmath0b , close to the area of a typical hadron .    of course the total cross section is dominated by peripheral collisions which can not be described in perturbative qcd . in the presence of a hard scale the photon proton cross section factorizes into terms describing the photon and proton structures , and a hard qcd subprocess .",
    "then a perturbative expansion may be applied to determine the subprocess cross section ( for an introduction to the theory of hard photoproduction see michael klasen s contribution to this proceedings ) .    with subsequent data sets h1 and zeus measured the photoproduction cross section for events in the perturbatively calculable regime , i.e. with jets of at least @xmath1  gev  @xcite .",
    "this cross section is naturally much smaller , of the order of 10  nb , however the hadronic nature of the photon is still prevalent .",
    "the hera experiments clearly established two classes of contribution to the photoproduction of jets : the direct process in which the photon itself participates in the hard subprocess and the resolved process in which the photon fluctuates into a hadronic object and one of its partonic constituents participates in the hard subprocess .",
    "for instance , h1 found an excess of energy in the rear direction , over what was expected for direct photoproduction processes  @xcite .",
    "this energy could be attributed to the presence of a photon remnant jet in the resolved photon process .",
    "an unambiguous distinction between resolved and direct processes exists only at leading order ( lo ) . in figures  [ fig : dirres](a ) and",
    "( b ) examples of direct diagrams in lo and next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , respectively , are shown .",
    "figure  [ fig : dirres](c ) shows an example of a resolved diagram at leading order .        clearly , if the outgoing quark line in the nlo direct diagram  [ fig : dirres](b ) has small transverse momentum then this process could as well be represented by the lo resolved diagram  [ fig : dirres](c ) .",
    "therefore some prescription must be introduced in order to make a well - defined distinction between direct and resolved processes .    to this end",
    "the observable quantity @xmath2 has been defined : @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the jet transverse energy and pseudorapidity respectively , @xmath6 is the fraction of the electron s energy carried by the incoming photon , @xmath7 is the incoming electron energy , and the sum runs over the two highest @xmath4 jets within the @xmath5 acceptance . at leading order @xmath8 for direct processes and @xmath9 for resolved processes .",
    "however , @xmath2 is well defined theoretically to any order of perturbation theory ( provided , of course , that the jet - finding algorithm is well - behaved ) .",
    "therefore , a quantitative confrontation of a measurement of a `` direct '' or `` resolved '' photoproduction cross section with a pqcd calculation can be made provided the separation between the direct and resolved regions is made in terms of @xmath2 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : zeus_xgam ] a measured @xmath2 distribution is shown for photoproduction events containing two jets of @xmath10  gev within @xmath11 in the hera lab frame  @xcite .",
    "spectrum for events with @xmath12  gev , compared to the herwig 5.9 and the pythia 5.7 monte carlo predictions .",
    "the direct component from the herwig monte carlo is shown separately as the shaded histogram .",
    "only statistical uncertainties are plotted [ fig : zeus_xgam ] ]    the data show a peak at high @xmath2 values with a broad tail extending to @xmath13 .",
    "the data are compared with the predictions of two parton shower monte carlo programs , herwig  5.9  @xcite and pythia  5.7  @xcite .",
    "the monte carlo calculations implement the qcd matrix elements at leading order only .",
    "the effect of higher order processes is approximated through initial and final - state parton showers .",
    "the programs differ in the choice of evolution variable for the parton shower calculation and also in the technique chosen to convert the final partonic configuration into colourless hadrons .",
    "both are able to provide a good description of the @xmath2 distribution .",
    "the distribution of the herwig events with lo direct photoproduction subprocesses is shown separately as the shaded histogram . the parton showering and hadronizaton phases smear the @xmath2 values such that this distribution is peaked just below one and can extend to the lowest available @xmath2 values .",
    "nevertheless it is plain to see that a sample of events with @xmath14 is essentially of the direct photoproduction type .",
    "zeus and h1 have published several papers in which direct and resolved photoproduction regions are defined based on the @xmath2 observable  @xcite and  @xcite to  @xcite    an important confirmation of the presence of the direct and resolved contributions to photoproduction was provided by the zeus measurement of dijet scattering angles  @xcite .",
    "a two jet final state can be completely specified in its centre - of - mass frame ( up to an arbitrary azimuthal rotation ) by the dijet invariant mass , @xmath15 , and the dijet scattering angle , @xmath16 .",
    "direct photoproduction processes should proceed predominantly through quark exchange ( the diagram shown at leading order in figure  [ fig : dirres](a ) ) . as",
    "the exchanged parton is of spin @xmath17 , at leading order the dijet scattering angle is distributed according to @xmath18 .",
    "in contrast , resolved processes are dominated by the exchange of the integer spin gluon which gives rise to the steeper angular dependence , @xmath19 .",
    "zeus observed a steeper angular dependence for the events with @xmath20 than for those with @xmath21 , as shown in figure  [ fig : zeus_angle ] .",
    "normalized to one at @xmath22 for @xmath23 ( _ black dots _ ) and @xmath24 ( _ open circles _ ) photoproduction . in (",
    "* a * ) , the zeus data are compared to nlo predictions ( _ solid line _ ) and lo predictions ( _ broken line _ ) . in ( * b * ) , the broken line is the pythia distribution and solid line is the herwig distribution .",
    "the inner error bars are the statistical errors , the outer error bars are the sum in quadrature of the statistical and systematic uncertainties ]    this is a compelling observation .",
    "an invariant mass cut of @xmath25  gev has been applied to ensure that the @xmath26  gev requirement does not bias the angular distribution .",
    "moreover , the dijet scattering angle is defined in the centre - of - mass frame of the two jets so the fact that the lower @xmath2 events are boosted more in the proton direction is not responsible for the differences observed in the @xmath27 distributions .",
    "the different @xmath28 distributions for the high and low @xmath2 samples are therefore an unambiguous demonstration of the differing underlying qcd subprocess dynamics .",
    "there is a greater contribution from gluon exchange processes contributing to the @xmath29 sample , than there is contributing to the @xmath21 sample .",
    "this is consistent with the expectation that more resolved photon processes contribute to the @xmath29 sample .",
    "thus it has been established that both direct and resolved processes contribute to photoproduction at hera .",
    "the study of these processes is now providing a fruitful forum for the investigation of strong interactions .",
    "photoproduction processes access the physics involved in the structures of the photon and proton , in the dynamics of hard subprocesses , and in the fragmentation and hadronization of the final state partons .",
    "the structure of the photon is probed in deep inelastic @xmath30 experiments at @xmath31 colliders in just the same way as the structure of the proton is probed in @xmath32 interactions at hera .",
    "these measurements of the photon s structure function , @xmath33 , constrain the quark densities at intermediate probing energy scales . however , the gluon density is not directly constrained in these experiments , nor do the quark density constraints extend to the high energy scale region accessible at hera .",
    "it is in these two areas that the hera experiments have concentrated their efforts .",
    "phenomenological anstze for the parton densities of the photon exist .",
    "these generally involve the assumption that at low probing virtualities , the photon undergoes a quantum fluctuation into a vector meson or an unbound @xmath34 state and this provides the photon s structure . a dglap evolution",
    "is then invoked in order to evolve the parton densities to arbitrary scale , using the @xmath30 @xmath35 data as a constraint .",
    "thus , studies of photoproduction sensitive to the photon s structure test fundamental physical assumptions , in addition to providing a means to investigate the universality of photon structure data obtained through different processes . in sections",
    "[ sec : real ] and [ sec : virtual ] the latest results from h1 and zeus pertaining to the structure of the photon are presented .",
    "perturbative qcd governs the behaviour of the partons emerging from the hard subprocess . as the distribution of the jets of hadrons in the final",
    "state bears a close correspondence to the distribution of the underlying partons , measurements may be designed which are sensitive to the subprocess dynamics .",
    "the differing dijet angular distributions for direct and resolved photoproduction have already been discussed .",
    "as the available luminosity delivered by hera has increased , it has become possible to look for unusual dynamical signatures in high @xmath4 dijet processes , and also to investigate the underlying mechanism of three jet production .",
    "studies of the matrix element dynamics are presented in section  [ sec : matrix ] .",
    "our knowledge is limited about the physics of hadronization , whereby the partons resulting from a collision are converted to colourless hadrons by the inexorable confinement force of qcd .",
    "the hadronization occurs at low momentum transfers where the qcd coupling is much too strong for a perturbative expansion to be relevant .",
    "however , there are experimental results which have provided some information about this interesting area of physics . for instance",
    ", a universality of the hadronization of quarks is supported by the measurements of jet shapes in @xmath32 and @xmath31 collisions  @xcite .",
    "recently , a procedure for measuring jet structure in hadronic collisions has been proposed which is valid for an all - orders calculation in perturbative qcd  @xcite . in this way",
    ", a well - defined comparison of theory and data can be undertaken which begins well within the regime where a perturbative approach should be valid and then approaches the mysterious realm of the very strong hadron producing force .",
    "a measurement of jet substructure using this algorithm is presented in section  [ sec : structure ] .",
    "a measurement which is sensitive to the gluon density of the photon has been made by the h1 collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the gluonic component of the photon dominates at low @xmath36 .",
    "therefore the events must be selected keeping @xmath4 as low as possible and allowing @xmath5 to extend as far forward into the incoming proton direction as possible .",
    "this is a difficult kinematic region experimentally , as the energy - scale uncertainty and angular resolution of the calorimeter are worst here .",
    "there are also theoretical limitations as the contribution from events in which there is a secondary scatter , and the smearing between a partonic and hadronic distribution , increase as @xmath4 lowers .",
    "nevertheless it has been possible to make the measurement with sufficient precision to illustrate the sensitivity of the data to the distribution of gluons in the photon .",
    "figure  [ fig : h1_xgam ] shows @xmath37   is essentially the same quantity as has been called @xmath38 . ] for events containing two jets of @xmath26  gev within @xmath39 .",
    "the data are compared with the predictions of the leading order plus parton shower monte carlo program phojet  @xcite where the predictions including and neglecting the gluons in the photon are shown separately .",
    "although there is a large systematic    .",
    "the data are compared to the prediction of phojet .",
    "the direct photon prediction , and the resolved photon predictions for either quarks are gluons , are shown separately ]    uncertainty affecting the measurement , within the phojet model a significant gluonic contribution at low @xmath40 is required by the data assuming the grv - lo  @xcite parton densities for the photon and proton .",
    "h1 have gone on to subtract the influence of secondary parton scattering and unfold the data to a leading order effective parton density , using the monte carlo model . from this",
    "the modelled quark density has been subtracted to yield the gluon density as a function of @xmath41 where now @xmath41 refers to the fraction of the momentum of the photon which enters the leading order hard subprocess .",
    "this is necessarily a model dependent result ; however it can serve to provide insight into photon structure .",
    "h1 finds that the gluon density rises as @xmath41 decreases .",
    "the zeus analysis of photon structure has concentrated on limiting the data to that kinematic regime in which perturbative qcd should be applicable , without the need for additional model parameters .",
    "dijet events have been selected with @xmath10  gev within @xmath11  @xcite . the @xmath2 distribution for this selection is shown in figure  [ fig : zeus_xgam ] .",
    "the pythia and herwig predictions which are compared with the data in this figure contain no simulation of soft underlying events or of secondary parton scatterings and provide a good description of the data .",
    "also , studies have indicated that hadronization effects in this kinematic regime should be small , at most around 10% .",
    "therefore a strong interpretation of this data within perturbative qcd can be made .    in figure",
    "[ fig : zeus_highy ] the cross section for the @xmath10  gev selection , @xmath42 , is shown in bins of @xmath43 .",
    "the kinematic region is restricted to a narrow @xmath6 range , in order to improve the sensitivity to the photon s structure .     in bins of @xmath44 .",
    "the filled circles correspond to the entire @xmath38 range while the open circles correspond to events with @xmath45 .",
    "the shaded band indicates the uncertainty related to the energy scale .",
    "the thick error bar indicates the statistical uncertainty and the thin error bar indicates the systematic and statistical uncertainties added in quadrature .",
    "the full , dotted and dashed curves correspond to nlo - qcd calculations , using the grv - ho , gs96-ho and the afg - ho parameterizations for the photon structure , respectively . in ( * d * ) the nlo - qcd results for the cross section when @xmath46 and for a particular parameterization of the photon structure are compared ]    the cross section is shown separately for @xmath47 , indicating that the direct process dominates when the jets tend toward the incoming photon direction .",
    "nlo perturbative qcd predictions with the three available photon parton parametrizations  @xcite are compared with the data in this figure .",
    "( note that the calculations have been checked by several different groups of theorists as reported in  @xcite . )",
    "the predictions underestimate the data in the central rapidity region where experimental and theoretical uncertainties are expected to be particularly small .",
    "as previously mentioned , the parton density of the photon is not well constrained by @xmath30 data at these high energy scales .",
    "therefore it is expected that the parton density of the photon may be underestimated in this kinematic regime in the currently available parton density functions of the photon .    in another interesting analysis by h1",
    "the photon remnant jet has been tagged in low @xmath48 events by running a clustering algorithm , requiring exactly four jets in the event and defining the photon remnant jet as that jet closest to the incoming photon direction  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 of the remnant jet was found to be correlated with the @xmath4 of the highest transverse energy jets .",
    "this points to the presence of the anomalous component of the photon s structure whereby the struck parton arises from a @xmath34 splitting of the photon rather than as a constituent of a fluctuation into a vector meson .",
    "the `` remnant jet '' can then , as in figure  [ fig : dirres](b ) , be viewed instead as one of the outgoing partons from a next - to - leading order hard subprocess .",
    "another promising process for constraining the parton density of the photon is prompt photon production , in which an outgoing quark from the hard subprocess is balanced not by a gluon , but by a photon ( see  @xcite for a complete discussion of the contributing diagrams ) .",
    "zeus has published a measurement of the cross section for prompt photon production in association with a jet  @xcite .",
    "a more inclusive measurement , whereby only the prompt photon is tagged without the jet requirement , is free of complications due to the matching of the jet definition in theory and experiment and relatively free of hadronization corrections .",
    "this then , like high @xmath4 production , is an area in which a strong interpretation can be made from the comparision of the data with the predictions of perturbative qcd .",
    "of course the cross section for prompt photon production is suppressed with respect to jet production due to the smallness of the electromagnetic coupling constant and currently the statistics are limited .",
    "nevertheless the technique of prompt photon identification has been refined and a first comparison with the theory indicates a rough agreement  @xcite .",
    "it is expected that as the virtuality of the incoming photon increases , less time will be available for it to develop a complex hadronic structure . to test this assumption ,",
    "h1 has measured the dijet triple differential cross section , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the average jet transverse energy and @xmath51 is the negative of the square of the momentum transfer at the scattered lepton vertex  @xcite . the cross section is presented in figure  [ fig : h1_virt ] as a function     shown as a function of @xmath52 for different regions of @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the scale factors applied to the cross sections are indicated .",
    "the error bar shows the quadratic sum of systematic and statistical errors .",
    "also shown is the herwig model where the direct component is shown as the shaded histogram ]    of @xmath53 in bins of @xmath54 in the range @xmath55  gev@xmath56 and in bins of @xmath51 in the range @xmath57  gev@xmath56 .",
    "the data are concentrated near @xmath58 with a small tail to lower values .",
    "compared with the data are predictions from the herwig model , where the events with a leading order direct subprocess are shown separately by the shaded histogram . looking at fixed @xmath54 , there is clear evidence for the expected suppression of the resolved processes as @xmath59 increases .",
    "however , wherever @xmath60 , the direct processes alone are insufficient to account for the low @xmath53 events .",
    "thus there is evidence for resolved photon processes , even well into the deep inelastic scattering regime , @xmath61  gev@xmath56 .",
    "h1 have extended the analysis in their publication  @xcite and unfolded the data to a leading order effective parton density , @xmath62 , relying on the monte carlo simulation to correct the data for hadronization and higher order effects .",
    "the behaviour of this parton density is consistent with a logarithmic rise with the probing resolution , @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the transverse momentum of the two outgoing partons at leading order .",
    "this is in contrast with the approximate scaling behaviour which has been observed for hadrons and reflects the presence of the anomalous , or @xmath34 splitting term , unique to the structure of the photon .",
    "the effective parton density is also found to exhibit a dependence on the photon s virtuality @xmath51 which is consistent with the expected logarithmic suppression implemented in the existing virtual photon parton density functions . incorporating an earlier measurement of @xmath65 at @xmath66 with these data , a drop in @xmath65 with @xmath51",
    "is indicated .",
    "( to compare the earlier measurement with this one the data have been evolved using the grv  lo parton densities to the same @xmath63 and @xmath36 range . )",

    "this measurement is complementary to the h1 analysis in that the @xmath69 data are analyzed together with the deep inelastic data at @xmath72  gev@xmath56 in a consistent way .",
    "also , making use of an auxiliary small angle electron tagger , the zeus measurement includes data in the important transition region between photoproduction and deep inelastic scattering , @xmath71  gev@xmath56 . from the @xmath67 measurements , similar conclusions can be drawn as in the h1 analysis :",
    "the population of the @xmath2 distribution is suppressed at low values as @xmath51 increases yet there is evidence for a resolved component of the photon even in the deep inelastic scattering regime , @xmath73  gev@xmath56 .    in order to make a precise statement concerning the evolution of the virtual photon parton densities with @xmath51 ,",
    "zeus has measured the ratio of the dijet cross section for @xmath74 to that for @xmath47 in bins of @xmath51  @xcite .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig : zeus_virt ] .",
    "the ratio of resolved to direct cross sections is found to fall with @xmath51 .",
    ", as a function of photon virtuality , @xmath51 .",
    "the inner error bar represents the statistical error and the outer the statistical and systematic uncertainties added in quadrature .",
    "the band represents the systematic uncertainty due to the jet energy scale .",
    "also shown are the predictions of herwig for two different choices for photon parton densities : grv for real photons ( _ full line _ ) and sas  1d ( _ dashed line _ ) which includes a suppression of the photon parton density with increasing photon virtuality .",
    "the lepto predictions are shown for @xmath75  gev@xmath56 ( _ dot - dashed line _ ) ]    in comparison , this ratio within the herwig model is flat for a photon parton density which does not fall with @xmath51 ( grv lo ) and falling for a photon parton density which does ( sas 1d  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the data indicate that the photon parton density is suppressed with @xmath51 in this lo description . furthermore ,",
    "as @xmath51 increases the data tend toward a leading order prediction which does not include any resolved photon contribution ( lepto  6.5.1  @xcite ) .",
    "the influence of the dominant qcd subprocesses on dijet angular distributions for events with @xmath76  gev has been observed , as already discussed . as the integrated luminosity delivered by hera continues to increase",
    ", it is important to re - measure these distributions in the newly accessible kinematic regimes , in order to check for new contributing processes to dijet production . using the 1995 to 1997 integrated data set zeus has measured the @xmath15 and @xmath28 distributions in the kinematic regime @xmath77  gev and @xmath78  @xcite .",
    "the measurement extends to a dijet invariant mass of @xmath79  gev , and the mass and angular distributions are well described by the predictions of perturbative qcd .    for three massless jets , five quantities",
    "are necessary to define the system .",

    "zeus has measured the three - jet cross section in the kinematic regime defined by @xmath90  gev , @xmath91 and @xmath92  @xcite .",
    "( in fact , the events have been further required to have at least two jets with @xmath26  gev and a third jet with @xmath1  gev , however these cuts are largely irrelevant because high @xmath4 values are forced by the energy and angular cuts . )",
    "the measured cross section is well described by  perturbative qcd calculations both in normalization and in the shapes of the @xmath83 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath88 distributions .",
    "the measured angular distributions are of particular interest since they differ markedly from the expectation for three jets distributed evenly over the available phase space , and are therefore sensitive to the underlying physical dynamics .",
    "the @xmath94 distribution , since it is primarily determined by the distribution of the highest energy jet , is similar in three jet production to the distribution of @xmath28 in two jet production .",

    "the dip at @xmath98 and @xmath96 is caused by a loss of phase space at low angles due to the @xmath99  gev requirement .",
    "taking this into consideration , the data indicate a strong tendency for the three - jet plane to lie close to the plane containing the highest energy jet and the beam .    to aid in the development of a mental picture for three jet production ,",

    "pythia predicts a relatively uniform population of the @xmath88 distribution , as shown in figure  [ fig : zeus_psi ] .",

    "this behaviour is well described by the pythia and herwig models . in the models the dominant leading order direct process is @xmath106 while the dominant resolved process is @xmath107 .",
    "therefore , relatively more gluon jets are expected for the more forward boosted resolved photon processes . moreover",
    ", the gluon in the @xmath107 subprocess has a tendency to be the more forward parton , further increasing the gluonic content of forward jets .",
    "the fundamental expectation of qcd that gluons , which have a higher colour charge than quarks , should yield a higher multiplicity of hadrons , is borne out in the models by a higher average subjet multiplicity for gluon jets than for quark jets .",
    "thus the increase of @xmath102 with @xmath5 may be understood to arise from an increasing admixture of gluon jets in the forward direction .",
    "we look forward to an eventual comparison of this data with perturbative qcd calculations .",
    "hard photoproduction events have been used in a variety of analyses in order to further the understanding of the physics of strong interactions . from studies of the structure of the real photon",
    "it has been shown that in a leading order interpretation of the data the gluon density rises as the momentum fraction of the photon accessed in the hard subprocess decreases .",
    "there is also an indication that the quark densities of the real photon may be underestimated at high momentum fractions and for high values of the probing energy scale . a global fit of @xmath30 and @xmath108 measurements should be undertaken to discover whether a parton density can be found which describes all the data .",
    "studies of the structure of the virtual photon have illustrated the expected suppression in the photon s structure as its lifetime decreases .",

    "a measurement of jet substructure has shown the sensitivity of jets produced in hard photoproduction processes to quark and gluon jet differences and revealed their potential to provide insight into the physics of hadronization .",
    "results from photoproduction at hera have progressed from simple manifestations of the photon s hadronic structure , to detailed investigations of that structure and of qcd in general . as the yearly luminosity deliverable by hera continues to increase , and as the dialogue between theorists and experimentalists is continuously strengthened , one may look forward to an even greater variety and quality of physics result to emerge from the investigation of hard photoproduction at hera ."
