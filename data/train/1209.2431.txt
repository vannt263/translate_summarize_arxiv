    "accretes gas from a main sequence companion , and the build up leads to a thermonuclear runaway ( tnr ) in the surface material .",
    "this generates a fireball , leading to the visual brightening that allows us to detect these events .",
    "this is accompanied by the ejection of around @xmath4 m@xmath3 of material at velocities of 200 to 5000 km  s@xmath2 ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * for a recent review ) .",
    "these episodic stellar explosions are commonly detected at optical wavelengths and provide valuable understanding of the nuclear burning and accretion phenomena .",
    "most of the cne follow a maximum - magnitude - rate - of - decline ( mmrd ) relationship , where the time to decay by 2 or 3 magnitudes from optical maximum ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 respectively ) is a reasonable indicator of the absolute magnitude ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as well as providing a distance estimate , this indicates the the underlying mechanism is fairly uniform across different examples .",
    "the rate of decline also defines a speed class  from very fast to slow  and it is evident that the fastest novae are also the most energetic ( being intrinsically brightest and having the fastest ejecta ) .",
    "this suggests a link between the development of the ejecta , the progress of the explosion and the energetics ( including any dependence on dredged up material ) of the tnr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "if these additional peaks are ignored , it seems likely that for v458  vul @xmath8 days , making this a fast nova .",
    "the mmrd relationship gives a distance of 13.5 , 11.6 and 10.0 kpc to v458  vul using @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath9 respectively @xcite .",
    "@xcite identified the star usno - b1.0  @xmath10 as the `` viable progenitor for the nova '' based on its colour and proximity to the nova position ( within @xmath11 ; * ? ? ?",

    "earlier spectra indicated v458  vul to be an fe  ii type nova , whilst later spectra were consistent with an he / n type .",
    "this suggests that , in the spectral classification scheme of @xcite , v458  vul is a hybrid nova @xcite .",
    "x - ray observations initially showed emission consistent with an expanding shock @xcite , before a soft component , reminiscent of rs  oph , came to dominate @xcite with a 12 hour oscillation becoming apparent , as this emission declined over 2008 ( swift nova consortium ) . in rs",

    ".summary of the gmrt observation of v458  vul [ cols=\"<,^ \" , ]     [ table : obs1 ]    obtaining a reliable distance estimate to the nova system is important in determining the physical parameters of the h  i structure . in table",
    "[ table : obs1 ] , the derived parameters for the system are presented assuming different distances to the nova . the columns in table  [ table : obs1 ] are ( i ) assumed distance , ( ii ) size and ( iii ) mass of the h  i shell , ( iv ) dynamical age of the shell for an average radius of @xmath23 assuming an expansion velocity of 10 km s@xmath2 , ( v ) proper motion corresponding to the observed separation of v458  vul from the centre of the h  i shell , and ( vi ) tangential velocity corresponding to a proper motion of 20 mas  yr@xmath2 ( see more on this below ) . note that even if the line width is @xmath1 km s@xmath2 , as we do not know the inclination , we have used a typical value of 10 km s@xmath2 for expansion velocity .",
    "if the expansion velocity on the sky plane is the same as the line of sight expansion velocity , the age will be about factor of two higher .",
    "interestingly , in spite of the significant spatial displacement between the h  i structure and the planetary nebula , and the difference in their estimated ages , their radial velocities are reasonably close ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 km  s@xmath2 respectively ) .",
    "the star usno - b1.0  @xmath10 has been identified as the progenitor of v458  vul by @xcite .",
    "the proper motion of the corresponding star listed by nomad is about @xmath26 mas  yr@xmath2 in right ascension and @xmath27 mas  yr@xmath2 in declination ( with the highest value of the probability estimator assigned for the likelihood that the quoted proper motion is correct ) .",
    "this is roughly @xmath28 mas  yr@xmath2 in the north - west direction . for a distance of 13 kpc ,",
    "the proper motion translates to an unreasonably large value of tangential velocity of @xmath29 au per year i.e. @xmath30 km  s@xmath2 ( see table  [ table : obs1 ] ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the required velocity , to displace the nova by the observed separation of @xmath31 from the centre of the h  i shell over this dynamical timescale , is only @xmath32 km  s@xmath2 or 0.27 mas  yr@xmath2 at 13 kpc ( see table  [ table : obs1 ] ) .",
    "this is the vector sum of the proper motion of the star and the ejecta ( which may be misaligned ; @xcite ) .",
    "so , the proper motion of v458  vul is expected to be smaller than this .",
    "also , v458  vul is centred to within @xmath33 of the 14000 years old planetary nebula @xcite , implying proper motion smaller than 0.07 mas  yr@xmath2 .",
    "it is more likely that the nomad proper motion is spurious for such a faint object ( e.g. , due to issues with the older plates used to derive proper motion ) .",
    "we also examined the possibility that usno - b1.0  @xmath10 is _ not _ the progenitor of v458  vul . at a distance of @xmath34 kpc",
    ", such a progenitor must be fainter than @xmath13 ( @xmath35 for @xmath36 ) .",
    "taking a conservative lower limit of @xmath37 , and using a typical stellar luminosity function @xcite , the average number density of stars with @xmath38 is @xmath39 . considering the position uncertainty to be @xmath40 , the volume , defined by a circle of @xmath11 radius ( on the plane of the sky centred at the nova position ) and a radial distance of @xmath41 kpc ( 2 kpc centred at a distance of 13 kpc ) , is about @xmath42 . within this volume",
    ", the average expected number of progenitor stars with the right @xmath43 is about 0.22 ( 0.62 for @xmath33 radius ) .",
    "the associated poisson distribution probabilities are 0.18 and 0.33 for @xmath11 and @xmath33 respectively . clearly , the possibility of an alternative nova progenitor at a distance of @xmath34 kpc is small .    if the h  i structure has a physical association with the nova , as implied by various pieces of evidence above , then an indirect argument in favour of a smaller distance to the nova is from the estimated mass of the h  i shell . at a distance of 13",
    "kpc , the enclosed h  i mass is @xmath44 m@xmath3 which is too large to be explained as swept - up mass .",
    "if the distance is @xmath45 kpc , the h  i mass may originate from a massive super - agb progenitor .",
    "such progenitors evolve to either neutron stars or massive onemg wds @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the massive ( @xmath46 m@xmath3 ) wd in v458  vul is consistent with this scenario .",
    "if the nomad proper motion , as argued above , is incorrect , based on parameter values in table  [ table : obs1 ] , a distance @xmath45 kpc seems plausible .",
    "it is important to constrain the proper motion of the faint nova progenitor , and if possible find tracers from the nova outburst which would give independent distance estimates , to cross check this suggestion of a smaller distance to v458  vul .",
    "the above discussion has been mainly restricted to the shell - like expanding structure northeast of v458 vul .",
    "however high velocity h  i has been seen over a much larger region around v458 vul .",
    "there are discrete clouds scattered around the nova with the central few arcminutes being devoid of h  i ( see figure  [ fig : fig-1 ] ) .",
    "one possibility is that there is another larger shell which traces the mass loss history at a still earlier evolutionary epoch of the nova binary system .",
    "this large shell ( approximately @xmath47 ) , with longer axis almost parallel to the smaller h  i shell we discussed above , also has the nova off - centred .",
    "moreover , this large shell seems to show weak evidence of expansion with the north / north - eastern parts moving at @xmath48 km  s@xmath2 and the southern parts being close to @xmath49 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "however this needs confirmatory observations especially since gmrt is expected to be missing flux on larger angular scales .",
    "no clear correlation is seen between the h  i and the iras 60 and 100 @xmath50 m dust emission , though the h  i shell appears to be located close to the edge of a dust cloud .",
    "from the above discussion , we conclude that we have detected an expanding shell of cold h  i possibly associated with v458  vul .",
    "if this is the case , it appears to be the remnant of the interaction of the nova system with the ism in its agb phase of evolution , as indicated by its slowing down and its peculiar morphology .",
    "however , at a distance of 13 kpc , the h  i structure would have an unreasonably high mass of 25 m@xmath3 .",
    "there are some indications that the nova is closer than 13 kpc , and further independent constraints on the distance to the nova will be very useful .    finally , it is relevant to mention that a large number of such systems might be distributed in the galaxy .",
    "while we have detected the h  i shell associated with v458  vul , it is likely that there are several such structures which have not been detected in h  i emission either because of the inadequate spectral resolution of such observations , or because they are so far from the central stellar system that the association is not obvious .",
    "more observations targeting such systems may be useful to understand the interaction with the surrounding ism and the mass loss phase of the evolution of classical novae progenitor system .",
    "we thank the staff of the gmrt who have made these observations possible .",
    "gmrt is run by the national centre for radio astrophysics of the tata institute of fundamental research .",
    "we are also grateful to the referee anita richards for a very useful review and for prompting us into substantially improving this paper .",
    "nr thanks m. rupen and s. bhatnagar for many helpful comments , and ngk thanks rajaram nityanada for discussions on proper motion .",
