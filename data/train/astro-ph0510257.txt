    "large - scale optical surveys show that the luminous qso number density peaks at @xmath4 , before which ( in cosmic time ) the qso number density grows rapidly and after which the density steadily decays until the present epoch ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the first indication of a density decline ( with redshift ) at @xmath5 was reported in the pioneering work of @xcite . the palomar transit grism survey ( ptgs ) @xcite",
    "was designed to investigate this possible  redshift cutoff \" , and produced a sample of 90 @xmath6 qsos ; an analysis of the ptgs @xcite ( hereafter ssg95 ) revealed a very rapid growth , by a factor of @xmath7 , of the number density of luminous qsos from @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
    "this result was verified by @xcite using a sample of @xmath10 quasars found in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ?",
    "this redshift cutoff has also been found in the number densities of radio flat - spectrum qsos @xcite .    in the x - ray regime , however , the size of a sample based on the combination of various _ rosat _ surveys , @xcite ( heraafter , sxlf1 ) was not sufficient to accurately probe this `` growth '' phase of the number density of x - ray - selected luminous ( @xmath11 ) qsos .",
    "while this study appears to show a flat number density in @xmath6 , the uncertainties produced by the small number of quasars limited the robustness of the conclusions .",
    "more recent studies including the results from _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ surveys @xcite showed that the number density curve is luminosity - dependent and a trend that as luminosity goes lower , the density peak shifts to lower redshifts ( as some authors call an anti - hierarchical agn evolution and others call a down - sizing of the agn activity ) .",
    "however , these studies did not sample well the high - redshift , high - luminosity regime , in which optically selected qsos show a decline at @xmath12 .    in a recent study based on an updated soft x - ray sample including",
    "_ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ surveys , @xcite ( hereafter sxlf3 ) also measured the number densities in various luminosity bins with a better accuracy over a large range in the redshift - luminosity space .",
    "the study revealed this early `` growth '' of agn number density ( or decline with increasing @xmath13 ) at z@xmath14 for agn / qso luminosities at ( @xmath15 44 - 45 ) .",
    "the results from `` champs '' survey , which was designed to optimally trace the high - redshift , high - luminosity ( @xmath16 ) regime with improved statistics , found that the density curves x - ray selected qsos ( @xmath16 ) declines with increasing redshift at @xmath12 .",
    "this decline is , however , shallower than that seen in optically - selected qsos .    the dependence of the optical to x - ray flux ratio ( customarily expressed by the quantity @xmath1 , the effective spectral index between the rest - frame 2500  and 2 kev ) , where xx is any subscript to @xmath17 . ] on redshift and luminosity has been a key issue in x - ray observations of high - redshift qsos and has important implications for possible differences in the agn evolution traced by x - ray and optical samples .",
    "some authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) found that @xmath1 strongly depends on luminosity , with @xmath18 , and no evidence for any evolution of the x - ray properties with redshift .",
    "@xcite found that variations in @xmath1 depends primarily on redshift .",
    "the dependence may be sensitive to the selection effects , including but not limited to whether the sample is optically - selected or x - ray selected .",
    "@xcite pointed out that such an apparent non - linearity of the luminosity correlation in two bands can arise from the difference in the luminosity variations in the two bands .    in order to investigate the redshift dependence of the optical - to - x - ray luminosity ratios and its impact on the density curves of luminous qsos in x - ray and optically selected samples at @xmath19 ,",
    "we have obtained _ chandra _ observations of six ptgs qsos with redshifts between 2.91 and 2.96 .",
    "this is the era of maximum number density of luminous qsos .",
    "there was practically no systematic observations in x - rays in this redshift regime before .",

    "the original motivation of the program was to compare the mean @xmath1 values of @xmath0 and @xmath22 qsos . in chandra cycle 4 ,",
    "six @xmath0 qsos from the ptgs ( out of 15 qsos proposed ) have been observed .",
    "none of these qsos are broad absorption line ( bal ) qsos .",

    "the core radio loudness @xmath23/f_\\nu [ 4400 $ ] @xmath24 $ ] is also shown , where those with @xmath25 and @xmath26 are divided into radio - quiet qsos ( rrq ) and radio - loud qsos ( rlq ) respectively ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the fluxes are in the object s rest frame , calculated assuming radio and optical spectral indices of @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively .",

    "the only radio - detected qso , pc 1035 + 4747 , has @xmath31 ; this object falls well into the rlq regime .",
    "two of the @xmath30 upper limits ( 1.5 for pc 0041 + 0214 and 1.2 for pc1000 + 4751 ) are above the rqq / rlq border , but their limits are well below the peak of the @xmath30 distribution of rlq .",
    "thus we tentatively classify them as rqqs .",
    "all observations have been made with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ; @xcite ) and the targets aimed at the default position of acis - s with the s3-chip . in all cases except pc 0947 + 5628 , x - ray counterparts have been found within @xmath32 of the cataloged optical center of the target qsos , consistent with the combined systematic error on the absolute astrometries of 1@xmath33 - 2@xmath33 in both the _ chandra _ data products and the ptgs survey .",
    "although the detected x - ray source closest to pc0947 + 5628 was @xmath34 away from the catalogued position of the qso , 6 other x - ray sources in the same acis observation also had optical counterparts at @xmath35 away with practically the same offset directions .",

    "due to low number counts of the involved objects , changes due to further updates of the calibration have negligible effects .",
    "the spectral analyses were made to the pulse - height channels corresponding to observed photon energies of 0.3 - 7 kev .",
    "background level is typically @xmath36 counts in the extraction radius and is thus negligible .",
    "the spectral analysis were made with * xspec 11.2*. in spite of small number of x - ray photons , the negligible background and the use of the * xspec * implementation of the @xcite c - statistics allowed placement of some constraints on the spectral indexes , although there are not sufficient number of photons in any individual spectrum to simultaneously constrain the intrinsic absorption column density .",

    "using @xmath43 @xcite increases @xmath42 by 0.35 .",
    "we also analyzed the summed spectrum from all six qsos . because of the small spread of the redsifts of these qsos , we can analyze the summed spectrum assuming a single redshift .",
    "the response matrix for the summed spectrum was constructed by a source - count weighted mean the 6 matrices .",
    "the galactic column densities @xmath38 of these six qsos are 0.9 , 1.0 , 1.0 , 1.3 , 2.0 and 2.8 .",
    "the fit was made to a model with the sum of three power - laws , with different galactic absorptions of @xmath44 and 2.8 respectively , where the four qsos with @xmath45 were represented by a single column density of 1.0 .",
    "the photon indices of all the three components were set to equal and the ratios of the 3 normalizations were fixed to those of the total source counts of the qsos with @xmath38 of 0.9 - 1.3 , 2.0 and 2.8 respectively .",
    "also an intrinsic absorption component @xmath46 is included with @xmath47 , which is a source - count weighted mean redshift of the sample .",

    "note , however , that the stacked spectrum is dominated by a few brightest sources , with 60% of the photons coming from the two brightest objects .",
    "the quoted error only includes the statistical error of photon counts .",
    "the sampling error is estimated by a bootstrapping method , where the 90% error range was determined by 500 bootstrap runs of a photon - count weighted mean best - fit @xmath37 values .",

    "our underlying assumption is that the variability does not cause a net systematic difference in its effect on the mean @xmath1 between sample a and sample d , separeted in redshift , but not in luminosity .",
    "both are optically selected samples and @xmath58 should be biased towards larger ( more optically luminous ) values than the `` true '' @xmath58 ( i.e. @xmath1 of time - averaged mean optical and x - ray luminosities ) , because optical selection is more likely to pick up the agn when it is more optically - bright , while the x - ray followup of the same object typically gives average x - ray luminosity of the source .",
    "as long as both are selected in the optical and followed up by x - ray , that the slope of the lfs are the same at both redshifts , and that there is no systematic difference in the variability amplitudes of agns with redshift , the effect of this `` variability '' bias should be the equal between sample a and sample d. thus we do not expect that the variabilty bias plays a major role in our analysis on the redshift dependence of @xmath58 .    from a combination of our sample at @xmath0 and @xmath2 qsos observed by _",
