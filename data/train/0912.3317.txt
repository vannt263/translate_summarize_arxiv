    "the lorentz and the cpt ( charge conjugation - parity - time reversal ) symmetries are commonly assumed to be the most fundamental elements in constructing the models of elementary particle physics .",
    "various attempts to break these symmetries have been intensively discussed in the literature .",
    "recently motivated by the pioneering work in condensed matter physics@xcite , hoava has proposed a class of models of non - relativistic quantum field theories @xcite , in which the spatially higher derivative terms are introduced to improve their ultraviolet behaviors .",
    "this theory , when applied to the gravity sector , is power - counting renormalizable and hence potentially ultraviolet ( uv ) complete@xcite , although a strong coupling problem needs to be aware of@xcite .",
    "moreover , a class of non - relativistic yang - mills gauge theories in d+1 dimensions whose free - field limit exhibits quantum critical behavior with gapless excitations and dynamical critical exponent @xmath0 have been studied in ref .",
    "the class of these theories are expected to be engineered from the d - brane configurations of string theory@xcite , and in the large - n limit , they have weakly curved gravity duals .",
    "a general feature of this theory is that , the action does not need the usual diffeomorphism invariance of general relativity , but has a fixed point in the infrared ( ir ) limit which can recover the lorentz invariance as an accident symmetry . as a specific low energy scale presentation of these theories",
    ", a non - relativistic maxwell theory appears to be the most potential one which might be detectable in experiments .",
    "probing for the violation of the lorentz and the cpt symmetries is an important approach to searching for new physics beyond the standard model@xcite . up to now , however the lorentz and the @xmath1 symmetries have passed a number of high precision experimental tests in the ground - based laboratory and no definite signal of their violation has been observed @xcite .",
    "so , the present lorentz and the @xmath1 violating effects , if they exist , should be very small to be amenable to the experimental limits .",
    "in the past several years , there has been a lot of studies on the lorentz and cpt test with the polarization of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) .",
    "one of the examples is to consider a scalar field which couples to the photon chern - simon term @xmath2@xcite .",
    "this interaction is lorentz invariant , however breaks dynamically the cpt and lorentz symmetries during the evolution of the universe when @xmath3 rolls down along a potential and @xmath4 gets a non - vanishing value .",
    "the parity violation , resulted by the rolling cosmological scalar@xcite as well as the gravitational chirality@xcite , leads to the rotation of the cmb photon polarization when propagating in the universe@xcite , and the current cmb data mildly indicates a non - zero value of this rotation angle@xcite . importantly in comparison to the laboratory experiments , using the cmb polarization has been shown to be the most powerful approach to testing the lorentz and cpt symmetries in the photon sector since the cmb photon has travelled a long time ( almost the age of the universe ) .    in this letter",
    "we study the model for a system consisting of a scalar @xmath3 coupled to the photon field in a lifshitz - type non - relativistic maxwell theory and discuss its implications for cmb polarizations .",
    "since the theory has different fixed points at uv and ir limits respectively , our results show that the rotation angle obtained in this model is quite different from what obtained in the usual case . for high energy photons ,",
    "the rotation angle is frequency dependent and this dependence differs from that of faraday rotation , which is a new feature of this model . for low energy photons ,",
    "the rotation angle obtained in this model coincides with the one for a dynamical scalar field coupled to the chern - simons current in the @xmath5 dimensional spacetime .",
    "this letter is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we review very briefly on the cmb polarization and its connection to the cpt test . in section iii",
    "we review also very briefly on the construction of a lifthitz - type theory . in section",
    "iv we present in detail the model with @xmath0 . in section v we study the implications of our model in cmb and calculate the rotation angle of the cmb photon .",
    "section vi is our conclusion and discussions .",
    "in this section we review very briefly how to use the cmb information to constrain the cpt violation . in general",
    "it is convenient to use the stokes parameters to study the cmb polarization . considering a monochromatic electromagnetic wave of frequency @xmath6 propagating in the positive direction of @xmath7 axis , which is described by an electric field @xmath8",

    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 reflect the cmb polarization which can be decomposed into a gradient - like ( @xmath13 ) and a curl - like ( @xmath14 ) component . for the standard theory of cmb , the @xmath15 and @xmath16 cross correlations vanish .",
    "however , with the presence of cpt violation by the interaction terms mentioned above , we could observe a rotation angle @xmath17 on the polarization vector of a photon@xcite .    in the following we",
    "study how the rotation angle affects the cmb power spectra . in a flat frw universe",
    ", we can expand the temperature and polarization anisotropies in terms of spin - weighted harmonic functions , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the unit of the propagation direction , and @xmath20 is the spherical harmonic function .",
    "one can study the gradient - like component and curl - like component by introducing a group of linear combinations of the coefficients @xmath21 and @xmath22 as follows , @xmath23    with the assumption of statistical isotropy , all the cmb power spectra can be defined as the following expressions , @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the temperature @xmath26 and the @xmath13 and @xmath14 modes of the polarization field respectively . to neglect the local fluctuations",
    ", the cmb photons travel through the universe by rotating their polarizations synchronously",
    ". then we obtain the rotation relations of the power spectra as follows , @xmath27 moreover , the @xmath15 and @xmath16 correlations do not vanish , @xmath28 and thus the polarization surface can be rotated as sketch in figure [ fig : sketch ] .",
    "if this rotation angle was observed in experiments , it would be a big challenge to the standard model of particle physics .",
    "in next sections we will discuss how a non - vanishing rotation angle appears in a lifshitz - type non - relativistic electrodynamics .    .",
    "an electromagnetic wave is propagating along the @xmath7 axis which is the horizontal one .",
    "the red arrow denotes the polarization direction . after a period of the propagation",
    ", its direction deviates from the original one . ]",
    "in this section we make a brief introduction to the lifshitz - type non - relativistic theory which is inspired by condensed matter physics@xcite .",
    "we work on a @xmath29 dimensional spacetime , with one time coordinate @xmath30 and @xmath31 spatial coordinates @xmath32 .",

    "therefore , this theory breaks a lorentz symmetry at ultraviolet limit .",

    "eventually , a lagrangian density can be given by @xmath53 and consequently we can learn that in the lifshitz - type theory a lagrangian density of a free field is a sum of kinetic term that involves time derivative and a potential that is derived from the three dimensional euclidean action . any model obtained through",
    "the above process is said to exactly satisfy the _ detailed balance condition_.    one may keep in mind that , we can add some deformations to the lagrangian@xcite if the relevant terms can keep the gauge invariance , symmetry in internal space , and renormalizability .",
    "these terms would bring a little violation of the detailed balance condition , yet is still well - defined .",
    "in this section we build a non - relativistic model describing a scalar field @xmath3 coupled with a photon gauge field @xmath54 in @xmath29 dimensional spacetime .",

    "these terms would bring a little violation of the detailed balance condition , yet is still well - defined . for a maxwell field and a scalar field we considered in this letter ,",

    "we can see that the last three terms in the lagrangian ( [ lagrangian ] ) violate the lorentz invariance explicitly while the send one violates the lorentz invariance dynamically if @xmath97 develops a non - zero time derivative which has been obtained by supposing a scalar field couples to an anomalous @xmath98 current as observed by ref .",
    "moreover , the possible couplings of @xmath99 to the standard model particles induce observable effects and have interesting implications in particle physics@xcite and cosmology@xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "in this section we will study the propagation of the photon described by the lagrangian in the infrared limit ( [ lagrangian ] ) . because @xmath100 is non - dynamical and this theory is gauge invariant",

    "the nontrivial solution requires the matrix of the coefficients has null determinant .",
    "this requirement is explicitly @xmath110 ^ 2~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and so yields , @xmath111 this modified dispersion relation leads to energy - dependent group velocities and will induce the time - delay of photons@xcite , which might be an observable effect in gamma ray burst experiments@xcite .",
    "we can see from above equation that the dispersion relations for left- and right - handed circular polarized components of photons are different .",
    "the polarization angle of the linear polarized photon will be rotated by an angle @xmath17 after a period of propagation@xcite .    in the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe , the rotation angle at high frequency regime (",
    "@xmath112 is quite large ) is given by @xmath113 where @xmath114 is a physical frequency and @xmath115 is the redshift when the photons were emitted . for the cmb ,",
    "the redshift is about @xmath116 .",
    "however , if @xmath112 has already lied in the low frequency regime when the photons start propagations , the rotation angle can be derived by making use of geometric optical approximation as generally discussed in @xcite , @xmath117 this result is similar to the case of cosmological cpt violation as considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the current cmb data mildly indicates a non - zero central value@xcite .",
    "notice that , this rotation angle is frequency dependent for high frequency photons , different from that of low energy photons .",
    "this frequency dependence is different from that of faraday rotation in which the polarization of the photon is rotated when it pass through a magnetic field . in the later case ,",
    "the rotation angle is inversely proportional to the square of the frequency of the photon , in the case here however it is proportional to the square of the frequency .",

    "the philosophy of a lifthitz - type non - relativistic theory with quantum criticality was motivated by a quantum theory of multiple membranes designed such that the ground - state wavefunction of the membrane with compact spatial topology reproduces the partition function of the bosonic string on worldsheet . due to its advantage on power - counting renormalization and non - relativistic peculiarity",
    ", this theory has been awoken and provided plentiful phenomenons when applied in various fields and so attracted a lot of attentions .",
    "for example as pointed out by refs .",
    "@xcite , because of its non - relativistic feature , the gravity sector in the lifshitz - type theory could effectively violate energy conditions and so can lead to a solution of bouncing universe @xcite and the cosmological perturbations in low energy regime form a scale - invariant spectrum @xcite with a potential red tilt@xcite . however , before phenomenological applying this theory into any subjects , we ought to consider whether this theory is discernible for observations .",
    "in this letter we have studied a non - relativistic model for a gauge field coupled with a scalar field , based on the construction of the lifshitz - type theory . specifically , we considered a model of electrodynamics which exhibits anisotropic scaling between time and space with the dynamical critical exponent @xmath0 .",
    "the theory is non - relativistic in essence , and hence the lorentz invariance is violated and can only be recovered in the low energy regime as an approximate symmetry by accident . accompanied with the violation of lorentz invariance , the cpt symmetry is also broken due to an existence of some chern - simons - like terms .",
    "this cpt violation can be viewed as the trans - planckian physics@xcite and lead to the generations of @xmath15 and @xmath16 modes on cmb polarization spectra and a rotation of the polarization of the photon propagated in the universe , and the rotation angle is frequency dependent in uv limit while similar to the case of a dynamical violation in ir limit .",
    "this signature , if detected by future cmb observations with higher precision , would be an important clue to new physics beyond standard model .",
