    "[ intro ] a key element for understanding the complexity and perplexity in high-@xmath3 cuprates , manganites and colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) nanomaterials is the experimental observation of phase separation ( ps ) instabilities at the nanoscale signaled by spin - charge separation and quantum phase transitions ( qpts )  @xcite .",
    "a new guiding principle for the search of new materials with enhanced tc is the proximity to quantum critical points ( qcps ) for spontaneous first order qpts attributed to intrinsic spatial inhomogeneities ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "strong quantum fluctuations dominate thermal fluctuations and affect the classical properties well above absolute zero temperature  @xcite .",
    "the inhomogeneous concentrated system in equilibrium can be well approximated as a quantum gas of decoupled clusters , which do not interact directly but through the grand canonical ensemble , with different electron number per cluster .",
    "our results for possible spatial inhomogeneities are directly applicable to nanoparticles and respective bulk nanomaterials which usually contain an immense number of isolated clusters in contact with a thermal reservoir by allowing electron number per cluster to fluctuate",
    ". the finite - size optimized clusters may be one of the _ few solid _ grounds available to handle this challenging problem in a bottom - up approach  @xcite by defining canonical and grand canonical local gap order parameters in the absence of a long - range order , spin or charge density waves  @xcite .",
    "the ps instabilities and spin - charge separation effects in bipartite hubbard clusters driven by on - site coulomb interaction @xmath4 display qcps which strongly depend on cluster topology  @xcite . in frustrated ( nonbipartite )",
    "geometries spontaneous transitions depend on the sign of the coupling @xmath5 and can occur for all @xmath4 by avoiding qcps ( level crossings ) at finite @xmath4 .",
    "the existence of the _ intrinsic qcps _ and inhomogeneities associated with the ps instabilities , are crucial ingredients of the superconducting ( sc ) and ferromagnetic qpts , providing important clues for understanding the _ incipient microscopic mechanisms _ of pairing instabilities in real space due to coexisting high / low electron ( hole ) or high / low spin up ( down ) densities in high-@xmath3 superconductors ( htscs ) and colossal magnetoresistive ( cmr ) nanomaterials respectively .",
    "however , small systems suffer from finite - size ( edge ) effects , so it is unclear whether the observed instabilities can survive in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "thus , tests on reduced boundary effects are necessary to confirm the picture of local instabilities in larger systems in the so - called  optimized \" betts building blocks ( finite square lattices )  @xcite .",
    "a square infinite lattice is tiled by identical square unit cells containing @xmath6 sites which periodically repeat in the lattice .",
    "for example , @xmath1-site unit betts cell in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is used to fill the whole lattice .",
    "the square units restore basic symmetrical properties of the infinite square lattice and periodicity of clusters partially preserves translational and rotational symmetries of the original lattice . therefore",
    ", betts cells are believed to be the most preferred unit blocks for relieving frustrations over other structures with the same size .",
    "all the betts unit cells can be defined uniquely by two edge vectors  @xcite which represent translational vectors between the nearest two clusters .",
    "the lattice generated by betts unit cells provides useful insights into certain physical aspects of the phase diagram in the @xmath7 model  @xcite . to our knowledge ,",
    "an exact calculation of phase separation and pairing under doping has not been attempted in the betts lattices applied to the hubbard model either with nearest or next nearest neighbors .",
    "different two - dimensional ( @xmath8 ) square structures , defined by the condition @xmath9 with a linear size @xmath6 ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 are integers ) , can be used as plaquettes to extrapolate the results to the infinite square lattice . here",
    "our primary goal is an exact study of critical instabilities in the two - dimensional @xmath1- and @xmath2-site betts ( generated ) lattices .",
    "-site finite unit cell ( block ) repeating periodically fill the entire ( _ infinite _ ) square @xmath8 lattice .",
    "the cells can be defined by edge vectors @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( arrows in the figure ) as defined in ref .",
    "the lattice in two dimensions can be tiled by periodically repeated betts ( isotropic ) unit cells with reduced edge ( boundary ) effects .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] an infinite square lattice has been tiled by @xmath6-site squares with edge vectors @xmath12 and @xmath13 , which represent displacements of one vertex to the equivalent vertex in the neighboring tile with which it shares an edge .",
    "notice that , if the sites are numbered as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , each odd site in the plaquette is surrounded by all the even sites ( as nearest neighbors ) and vice versa .",
    "the betts unit cells take full advantage of the local space group symmetries of the isotropic @xmath8 ( square ) bipartite lattice . the two - orbital hubbard model with p bonding orbitals after elimination of the cu sites can be reduced to a single - orbital hubbard model with the nearest and next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) couplings by allowing holes to move within a given oxygen sublattice .",
    "thus , we consider the minimal hubbard model @xmath14 where summation goes through all lattice sites @xmath6 with coupling integral @xmath15 equal to @xmath5 for the nearest and @xmath16 for the next nearest neighbors .",
    "the lattice frustration with @xmath17 allows study of electron pairing in the absence of electron - hole symmetry .",
    "below , an exact diagonalization technique is used to extract the pairing instabilities and qcps in finite @xmath1- and @xmath2-site cluster - based betts square lattices with periodic boundary conditions . in our previous work ( refs .",

    "the canonical charge gap also describes electron fluctuations between different many - body cluster configurations , @xmath27 with different electron densities , @xmath28 .",
    "the charge fluctuations closely resemble resonant valence fluctuations  @xcite . under certain conditions",
    "the charge gap can be associated with either an excitation ( @xmath29 ) or a binding ( @xmath30 ) energy .",
    "physically , @xmath29 manifests a stable @xmath31 state , while @xmath30 implies a discontinuous spontaneous ps instability , _ i.e. _ , first order transition ( a negative compressibility ) with the generation of @xmath32 and @xmath33 states of an inhomogeneous ( mixture ) of hole - rich and electron - rich phases coexisting with different @xmath11 . here , we focus on one hole off half filling , @xmath34 . at the same time condition",
    "@xmath30 implies delocalization of holes ( electrons ) and pairing , which strongly suggests a possible local ( correlation ) coexistence of pairing with phase separation ( segregation ) rather than their competition . in the negative charge gap region ( @xmath30 ) , the spin pseudogap is nonnegative , _",

    "when the excited state has a higher ( lower ) total spin , the spin gap is positive ( negative ) .",

    "<S> spontaneous phase separation instabilities with the formation of various types of charge and spin pairing ( pseudo)gaps in @xmath0 hubbard model including the _ next nearest neighbor coupling _ are calculated with the emphasis on the two - dimensional ( square ) lattices generated by @xmath1- and @xmath2-site betts unit cells . the exact theory yields insights into the nature of quantum critical points , continuous transitions , dramatic phase separation instabilities and electron condensation in spatially inhomogeneous systems . </S>",
    "<S> the picture of coupled anti - parallel ( singlet ) spins and paired charged holes suggests full bose condensation and coherent pairing in real space at zero temperature of electrons complied with the bose - einstein statistics . </S>",
    "<S> separate pairing of charge and spin degrees at distinct condensation temperatures offers a new route to superconductivity different from the bcs scenario . </S>",
    "<S> the conditions for spin liquid behavior coexisting with unsaturated and saturated nagaoka ferromagnetism due to spin - charge separation are established . </S>",
    "<S> the phase separation critical points and classical criticality found at zero and finite temperatures resemble a number of inhomogeneous , coherent and incoherent nanoscale phases seen near optimally doped high-@xmath3 cuprates , pnictides and cmr nanomaterials .    </S>",
