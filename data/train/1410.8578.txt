    "the main subject of this paper lies at the interface of computable analysis ( @xcite ) and algorithmic randomness ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",

    "this approach can be formalized via identifying exceptional properties with effective null sets . to different types of effective null sets",
    "correspond different notions of algorithmic randomness .",
    "one of the most fruitful areas of research concerned with interconnections between the two subjects is differentiability of effective functions .",
    "the main reason for this is that sufficiently well - behaved functions are almost everywhere differentiable . in this case",
    "the set of non - differentiability points of an effective function forms an effective null set and thus a test for algorithmic randomness .",
    "this makes it possible to characterize different randomness notions in terms of sets of points of differentiability of effective functions .",
    "conversely , sets of points of differentiability for functions of particular classes can be characterised in terms of algorithmic randomness .",
    "the results of this kind are particularly compelling , since they show non - trivial connections between two seemingly distant areas of mathematics .    in recent years",
    ", a number of results of that kind have been published ( for example , see @xcite ) .",
    "most of them are concerned with functions of one variable .",
    "relatively few results are known about effective functions of several variables .",
    "our first result is concerned with lipschitz functions , which are particularly well behaved and enjoy a lot of attentions from mathematicians since they appear naturally in various contexts .",
    "the following classical result is called rademacher s theorem ( see section 3.1 in @xcite ) , it states that lipschitz functions are almost everywhere  differentiable .",
    "suppose @xmath0 is an open subset of @xmath1 and is a lipschitz function .",

    "the question whether the converse of the classical rademacher s theorem holds , that is whether every lebesgue null - set is contained in a set of non - differentiability points of a lipschitz function , has been answered very recently after several decades of work by classical analysts ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the converse holds when @xmath8 and does not hold otherwise .",
    "to characterise differentiability sets of effective functions in terms of randomness in the usual way , those functions must be differentiable almost everywhere , for otherwise the sets of non - differentiability do not form null sets and can not be interpreted as exceptional properties .",

    "suppose @xmath407 .",
    "then we have @xmath408 for all @xmath409 and thus we get    @xmath410    hence , for @xmath400 we have @xmath411 therefore @xmath294 does not exist .    @xmath2 is differentiable almost everywhere .    let @xmath13^n } $ ] .",
    "there are three possible cases :    1 .",
    "@xmath412 does not exist for some @xmath338 , 2 .",
    "@xmath14 belongs to the support of @xmath324 for infinitely many @xmath338 , or 3 .",
    "@xmath14 belongs to the support of @xmath324 for only finitely many @xmath338 and all @xmath412 exist .",
    "note that this implies differentiability of @xmath2 at @xmath14 .",
    "the first case corresponds to a null - set , since every @xmath324 is a.e .",
    "the second case corresponds to a null - set too , since it implies @xmath413 .",
    "the last case implies differentiability of @xmath2 at @xmath14 and it must correspond to a set of full measure since the cases ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are captured by null - sets .",

    "despite the obstacle described in the subsection [ dore_maleva ] , we conjecture that computable randomness , just like on the unit interval , characterises differentiability points of all computable real - valued lipschitz functions . proving",
    "the converse to the effective version of rademacher s theorem ( that is , showing that differentiability of computable lipschitz functions implies computable randomness ) remains an open question of great interest .",
    "there are quite a few results in classical analysis about differentiability of functions of several variables that exhibit lipschitz - like behaviour .",
    "naturally , those results are related to rademacher s theorem .",
    "studying effective versions of those will improve our understanding of interplay between computable analysis and algorithmic randomness . here",
    "we mention two such theorems that we feel are of particular importance :    \\(1 ) alexandrov s theorem ( see 6.4 in @xcite ) states that convex functions are twice differentiable almost everywhere .",
    "convex functions and monotone functions are closely related : on the real line , a function is monotone if and only if it is a derivative of a convex function . for functions of several variables ,",
    "the relation is a bit less straightforward ( see @xcite ) .",
    "recently it has been shown that both twice - differentiability of computable convex real valued functions on @xmath1 and differentiability computable monotone functions on @xmath1 correspond to computable randomness ( see @xcite ) .",
    "\\(2 ) it is known that @xmath88-monotone functions of several variables are a.e .",
    "differentiable ( see @xcite ) .",
    "two of the three steps of our proof in section [ lip_section ] work for @xmath109monotone functions .",
    "the one that does nt work is the one in subsection [ existence_directional_derivatives ] .",
    "it is not known whether computable randomness implies differentiability of @xmath109monotone computable functions , and what randomness notion is induced by a.e .",
    "differentiability of computable @xmath109monotone functions .",
    "on the other hand , our result concerning weak 2-randomness is sharp : weak 2-randomness does characterise differentiability sets of computable a.e .",
    "differentiable functions of several variables .",
    "there are many other similar results in one dimension that characterise differentiability of effective functions in terns of algorithmic randomness .",
    "generalizing those results to higher dimensions ( and , perhaps , to more general spaces ) will provide more insight into interactions between computable analysis and algorithmic randomness .",
