    "the wisconsin h@xmath0 mapper ( wham ) sky survey maps the h@xmath0 emission from the diffuse warm ionized medium with unprecedented sensitivity and coverage ( haffner , reynolds , and tufte 1999 ) .",
    "one of the brightest large regions is the orion - eridanus superbubble .",
    "we have been combining data from many sources for this region to gain a detailed understanding of physical conditions and processes ( heiles , haffner , and reynolds 1999 ) .",
    "here we present our results and analysis of a small portion of this region , the barnard loop ( bl ) .",
    "odell , york , and henize ( 1967 ) developed a coherent physical model based on uv , optical , and radio data .",
    "their uv images are particularly interesting because the uv is dominated by scattered light and allows derivation of dust grain properties ; they are also of historical interest , having been taken by astronauts aboard the gemini 11 spacecraft .",
    "they model bl as an ellipsoid in which the volume density increases roughly as distance@xmath9 , and suggest that the ionized portion of bl is surrounded by a neutral hi shell .",
    "they discuss the density structure as being produced by radiation pressure of light from the central stars pushing on the grains . over a period @xmath10",
    "yr this would produce the observed structure , which should have expansion velocity @xmath11 km s@xmath12 .",
    "we will defer discussion of the kinematics and correspondence with this model to a later paper .",
    "here we restrict ourselves to a detailed analysis of radio , optical , and diffuse ir emission data to determine the physical conditions and dust grain properties in bl .",
    "section  [ barnardradiosection ] analyzes radio continuum surveys at four different frequencies and finds bl to be a thermal ( optically thin free - free ) emitter .",
    "section  [ barnardrjrsection ] combines the radio and wham h@xmath0 data to derive upper limits on electron temperatures .",
    "section  [ absolutecal ] considers a discrepancy between the radio / h@xmath0 temperature and previous temperatures derived from the nii and h@xmath0 lines and derives a correction factor for the absolute intensity scales of the radio and wham surveys .",
    "section  [ individualobjects ] adopts reddenings and turns the upper limits into actual temperatures .",
    "section  [ dirbefits ] combines the dirbe ir , 21-cm line ( hartmann and burton 1997 ) , and radio continuum data to derive the bl electron density , grain temperature , and relative population of very small grains and pah s .",
    "finally , section  [ conclusions ] summarizes our findings .",
    "reich ( 1978 ) provides a very useful history of radio observations of the barnard loop ( bl ) , which we will not repeat here .",
    "he concludes that there are significant background emission fluctuations , and these prevent an accurate determination of the spectral index of the loop itself .",
    "however , haslam and salter ( 1971 ) , studied the bright top portion at 85.5 , 240 , and 408 mhz and found @xmath13 , consistent with a thermal spectrum .    in hopes of narrowing this conclusion",
    ", we examined four surveys of radio continuum emission to determine whether bl is a thermal or nonthermal radio emitter .",
    "these were the 408 mhz survey of haslam et al ( 1983 ) , the 820 mhz survey of berkhuijsen ( 1972 ) , the 1420 mhz survey of reich and reich ( 1986 ) , and the 2326 mhz survey of jonas , baart , and nicolson ( 1998 ) .",
    "the three lower - frequency datasets are available from _ http://www.mpifr - bonn.mpg.de / survey.html_. jonas provided us with the full - resolution version of the 2326 mhz survey .",
    "we were concerned that the surveys might exhibit scale errors .",
    "we addressed this problem by using the @xmath1ori hii region as a calibrator , assuming that it was an optically thin free - free ( thermal ) source with @xmath14 . using this as a calibrator has both good and bad points .",
    "for the good , it is large compared to any of the surveys angular resolution and it is not so bright as to introduce nonlinearities .",
    "however , its low intensity makes its derived flux susceptible to zerolevel and background intensity fluctuations , which are definitely present , particularly in the lower frequency surveys where nonthermal background radiation is brighter . for each survey we calculated the excess brightness of the hii region for four different choices of on and off regions ; our final choice used only the brightest part of the hii region for the on and two immediately adjacent areas for the offs , as shown by the three areas outlined by dashed lines in figure  [ quadradio ] .",
    "we adopted the 2326 mhz survey as a standard and derived the factors required to correct the other surveys to produce the thermal scaling .",
    "for the four choices , these factors ranged from @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 for the 408 , 820 , and 1420 mhz surveys , respectively ; for our final choice illustrated in figure  [ quadradio ] , the factors are @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "the quoted uncertainties are simply half the difference in ranges quoted above and should be overestimates , because the differences occur primarily because of background fluctuations and our final choice has the offs closest to the on .",
    "if the intensity scales of the surveys were identical , these factors would be unity .",
    "the first two have large uncertainties , but nevertheless seem to differ significantly from unity .",
    "the 1420 mhz survey certainly differs significantly from unity .",
    "reich and reich ( 1988 ) find that the 1420 mhz survey needs to be multiplied by 1.55 to agree with the 408 mhz survey ; our derived value of 1.45 differs from this factor by only @xmath21 .",
    "we used these factors to make difference images .",
    "first we multiply each of the three low - frequency surveys by its factor .",
    "then we multiply each survey image by the factor @xmath22 , which converts all the temperatures to the 2326 mhz temperature if the emission is thermal .",
    "finally , we convolve the 2326 mhz image to the same angular resolution and subtract it . the result is a difference image in which departures from the arbitrary and unknown zero - level offset represent nonthermal emission .",
    "if there is any morphological structure in the difference images that looks like the bl , then the loop exhibits nonthermal emission .",
    "figure  [ quadradio ] exhibits the three scaled difference images , together with the 2326 mhz image .",
    "the diagonal cutoffs in the images arise from the declination limits of the surveys .",
    "the dotted half - ring guides the eye to bl and the calibration rectangles illustrate offsets @xmath23 k from each difference image .",
    "all four images exhibit stripes ; they run along the scanning direction and represent zerolevel errors from one scan to another in the original data .",
    "the three lower frequency difference images reveal artifacts and also background intensity fluctuations .",
    "the 1420 mhz difference image , lower left , exhibits broad vertical stripes ; these are zero level errors because they extend all the way to north celestial pole .",
    "the 408 mhz image exhibits fluctuations over a broad angular scale , about @xmath24 the size of the image , or about @xmath25 ; these are not as distinct at 820 mhz and might be partly or wholly spurious .    the @xmath1ori hii region is invisible in the difference images of figure  [ quadradio ] , which serves as a check on our method .",
    "bl is not recognizable in either the 820 or the 408 mhz difference image .",
    "the 408 mhz image does exhibit excess emission @xmath26 k to upper right of center , but this feature has no morphological relationship to bl .",
    "moreover , there is no obvious evidence of this excess in the 820 mhz map , so the structure might be spurious .",
    "bl seems to be dark in the 1420 mhz difference image .",
    "however , the most noticeable dark portions lie on the dark broad stripes , so this appearance may be spurious",
    ".    the calibration rectangles are easily recognizable at 820 and 1420 mhz , while bl is not .",
    "thus , the nonthermal low - frequency emission from bl @xmath27 k. at 2326 mhz , bl s bright horizontal top portion ( bl - top in figure  [ quadoptical ] ) has @xmath28 k and the left vertical portion ( bl - left ) has @xmath29 k at 2326 mhz ; the limit of @xmath23 k means that @xmath30 and @xmath31 of the emission is nonthermal at the lower frequencies . at 1420 mhz",
    "bl might exhibit a deficiency at this level , but this is contrary to nonthermal emission , which has a steeper spectrum than thermal emission .",
    "therefore , these visual estimates of upper limits on nonthermal emission are quite conservative .",
    "one usually derives the spectral index of a morphologically distinct extended feature by making plots of intensities at many positions at one frequency versus those at a different frequency and performing a least squares fit .",
    "instead , for each survey we fit the difference image @xmath32 to the 2326 mhz brightness @xmath33 . for bl - top",
    "we obtained @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 for the 408 , 820 , and 1420 mhz data , respectively ; for bl - left we obtained @xmath37 and @xmath38 for the 408 and 1420 data , respectively .",
    "the significant negative slopes for the 1420 data probably reflect the coincidence of bl with the broad stripes , and the significant positive slope for bl - top at 408 is not revealed in the difference image except as a morphologically inconsistent bright blob . in our opinion ,",
    "these least squares fits are meaningless because of artifacts and nonthermal emission fluctuations in the low frequency images .",
    "we conclude that bl exhibits no recognizable nonthermal emission . for bl - left our conservative upper limit",
    "is that @xmath31 of the 408 mhz emission is nonthermal , and for bl - top @xmath30 .",
    "nonthermal brightness temperatures typically @xmath39 , so at 2326 mhz these limits become @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "in this section we derive the electron temperature by comparing the 2326 mhz and h@xmath0 intensities , assuming that all of the 2326 mhz emission is thermal .",
    "the important quantity for these emission processes is the emission measure @xmath43 ,    @xmath44    where @xmath2 is the _ total _ electron density .",
    "electrons come from both h@xmath6 and he@xmath6 , so @xmath45 , where @xmath46 accounts for the ionized he ; below , we argue that @xmath47 .",
    "figure 1 compares the radio and optical images . to facilitate quantitative comparison of the radio and h@xmath0 emission",
    "we convert the usual intensity units of brightness temperature and rayleighs to identical units that are close to the emission measure , normalizing to @xmath48 and @xmath49 :    [ emboth ] @xmath50    @xmath51    where @xmath43 is in @xmath52 pc , @xmath53 the electron temperature in units of @xmath54 k , and @xmath55 the reddening in magnitudes .",
    "these equations derive from mezger and henderson ( 1967 ) and haffner et al ( 1999 ) , respectively . here",
    "@xmath56 is the observed 2326 mhz brightness temperature and @xmath57 the observed integrated line intensity in rayleighs .",
    "these differ from the true intensities for two reasons .",
    "one is the error in absolute calibration ; we define the intensity scale errors by    [ scaleerror ] @xmath58 @xmath59    the other is angular size , which is discussed below . with these definitions",
    ", we have    [ emmboth ] @xmath60    @xmath61    here we have used the extinction curve of savage and mathis ( 1979 ) .",
    "internal extinction , which occurs within the emitting region itself , is less effective than external extinction because a significant fraction of the extinction is scattering , and internal extinction does not scatter photons away from the observer ( mathis 1983 ) .",
    "we have assumed that the extinction occurs in a foreground cloud sufficiently far from the emitting region that scattered h@xmath0 photons are lost , so that the standard extinction law applies . if our assumption is invalid , then reddening has less effect than above .",
    "combining equations  [ emmboth ] we have    @xmath62    here the subscript @xmath63 means that the temperature is determined by combining radio and h@xmath0 data .",
    "figure  [ quadoptical ] exhibits two sets of the 2326 mhz radio and h@xmath0 optical images side - by - side ; one set exhibits bl and the other set a weak filament .",
    "we delineate four regions with dashed lines : the @xmath1ori hii region ; bl - top , the top bright portion of bl ; bl - left , the left dim portion of bl ; and filament , a weak filament lying near @xmath64 . for each region",
    "we make a least squares fit for coefficients @xmath65 and @xmath66 in the equation    @xmath67    table  [ barnardtable ] presents the results and figure  [ halfa_radioplot ] exhibits plots of @xmath68 _ vs _",
    "@xmath69 for the four regions .",
    "table  [ barnardtable ] also presents the deduced temperatures @xmath70 after multiplying the slopes @xmath66 for the bl and filament entries by @xmath71 as described immediately below .",
    "it is not appropriate to multiply @xmath65 by @xmath72 because a is an offset whose value is determined by the background , whose angular scale exceeds @xmath73 .",
    "equations  [ scaleerror ] are not quite correct because of inadequate angular resolution , otherwise known as `` beam dilution '' .",
    "the optical data integrate over a @xmath74-diameter circle and are spaced by about @xmath74 ; bl and the @xmath1ori hii region are larger than @xmath74 in all dimensions , so no correction is required . however , for objects @xmath75 diameter the 2326 mhz intensities must be corrected upwards by the factor    @xmath76    where @xmath77 is the beam efficiency , @xmath78 the source solid angle , and @xmath79 the solid angle of a @xmath73-diameter circle ( jonas et al 1998 ) .",
    "the @xmath1ori hii region has diameter @xmath80 so there is no correction . using the high - resolution h@xmath0 image of isobe ( 1973 ) , we model bl as a rectangle of dimensions @xmath81 , and we take @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the solid angle of a @xmath84 diameter circle .",
    "the accuracy of @xmath42 depends on the accuracy of the absolute calibrations of the 2326 mhz and h@xmath0 datasets .",
    "absolute calibrations are notoriously difficult so we can not rely on them .",
    "rather , we use other temperature determinations to adjust our results .    here",
    "we consider other temperatures determined by two techniques , both of which compare the [ nii ] @xmath85 and h@xmath0 lines .",
    "one uses the line intensity ratio and one the difference in line width ; we denote these temperatures by @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively .",
    "comparing these lines has the great virtue that they are measured with the same instrument , so systematic errors cancel .",
    "the only significant problem from comparing the [ nii ] and h@xmath0 lines is possible temperature variations along the line of sight .",
    "the [ nii ] line emissivity increases exponentially with temperature , while the h@xmath0 and radio emissivities decrease with temperature ; thus , the [ nii ] line preferentially samples high temperature regions . in a low - density hii region ,",
    "the equilibrium temperature is independent of density .",
    "however , the temperature depends on distance from the star , becoming highest near the edge where the spectrum of ionizing radiation hardens .",
    "for example , models 3 and 4 by rubin ( 1968 ) are not too dissimilar from the @xmath1 ori situation and exhibit variations @xmath88 .",
    "we can get a rough idea of these effects by considering a two - temperature toy model , @xmath89 and 0.80 , with equal emission measures at each temperature .",
    "we show the results in table  [ tmodels ] .    for all entries in table  [ tmodels ] , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "as expected , @xmath92 , but by a modest amount compared to the difference between the physical temperatures of the two regions .",
    "in contrast , @xmath87 depends very sensitively on the relative turbulent velocities in the two regions and can easily lie outside the physical temperature extremes that exist .",
    "we conclude that @xmath87 must be used with caution , unless one can be sure that the nonthermal velocity is constant in the region .",
    "both [ nii ] and h@xmath0 lines have been measured for two of our objects , the @xmath1 ori hii region and bl .",
    "this hii region is excited by the star the o8iii star @xmath1 ori ; such a star has effective temperature 34000 k ( binney and merrifield ( 1998 ) .",
    "the radius of the he@xmath6 ionization zone is about 0.35 the h@xmath6 zone ( osterbrock 1989 ) , so the he@xmath6 volume is only about 0.04 the h@xmath6 volume ; accordingly , we neglect the he@xmath6 and take @xmath93 .",
    "our upper limit is @xmath94 .",
    "the exciting star has reddening @xmath95 mag ( diplas and savage 1994 ) .",
    "if all of this extinction occurs in front of the hii region , then we have @xmath96 .",
    "reynolds and ogden ( 1982 ) measured the [ nii ] and h@xmath0 lines ; applying equation ( 11 ) of haffner , reynolds , and tufte ( 1999 ) gives @xmath97 .",
    "also , reynolds and ogden found @xmath98 from a linewidth comparison ; if the uncertainty were smaller , then the agreement would suggest that the temperature does nt change much along the line of sight .",
    "we adopt the temperature from the intensity ratio , @xmath97 .",
    "the difference is far larger than the uncertainty .",
    "however , the results for the toy model in table  [ tmodels ] suggest that we should expect a difference of a few hundredths .",
    "suppose that the true value of @xmath70 should be a few hundredths smaller than @xmath100 , say 0.54 .",
    "there are two ways to make our derived @xmath70 equal to 0.54 . for one way ,",
    "the effective @xmath55 is not 0.12 mag , but instead the value required to reduce our upper limit of 0.71 to 0.54 ; this would make the effective @xmath101 mag .",
    "this could occur if most of the extinction to the star @xmath1 ori occurs within the hii region itself .",
    "this is highly unlikely : the @xmath1 ori hii region has a total column density to its center @xmath102 @xmath103 ( reich 1978 ) , which corresponds to @xmath104 mag for the normal gas / extinction ratio ( bohlin , savage , and drake 1978 ) .",
    "this is much smaller than the total reddening to the star .    for the other way",
    ", we adjust the intensity scale errors to attain agreement . from equation  [ t4eqn ]",
    "we require @xmath105 , or @xmath106 .",
    "again we take @xmath107 because bl is far from the exciting stars .",
    "our upper limit is @xmath108 .",
    "there is a previous radio determination by gaylard ( 1984 ) , who measured radio recombination lines and continuum intensities at three positions ; the average of his temperatures is @xmath109 .",
    "the agreement between our upper limit and his value is good , which implies that the reddening to bl - top is very low .",
    "reynolds and ogden ( 1979 ) measured the [ nii ] and h@xmath0 lines ; again , applying equation ( 11 ) of haffner , reynolds , and tufte ( 1999 ) gives @xmath110 . also , reynolds and ogden found @xmath111 from a linewidth comparison .",
    "these two temperatures differ by @xmath112 . from our discussion in section  [ toymodel ]",
    "above , we eliminate @xmath113 from consideration and adopt the temperature from the intensity ratio , @xmath110 .",
    "the difference is significant at the @xmath115 level .",
    "however , it seems that there is temperature structure within bl , so the expected difference is perhaps @xmath116 .",
    "thus , we ascribe the larger observed difference to a scale error in @xmath70 and suppose that the true value of @xmath70 should be @xmath117 . if there is no extinction , then we must adjust the intensity scale errors to attain agreement . from equation  [ t4eqn ]",
    "we require @xmath118 , or @xmath119 .",
    "above in section  [ tworegions ] we found two independent values for the ratio of radio to optical correction factors .",
    "they agree well even though their uncertainties are rather large .",
    "we adopt the unweighted average @xmath120 ; the uncertainty does not include the errors in our guesses for the proper differences @xmath121 .",
    "we provisionally assign all of the calibration error to @xmath122 , for several reasons .",
    "firstly , the present h@xmath0 data are not corrected for sky transmission variations , either night - to - night or airmass .",
    "secondly , the h@xmath0 absolute calibration is ultimately tied to the brightness of a @xmath74 diameter region in ngc7000 ( the north american nebula ) , and the absolute intensity of this region is uncertain at the level @xmath123 .",
    "finally , jonas ( 1999 ) has determined the uncertainty in the 2326 mhz intensity to be @xmath124 .",
    "for the remainder of the present paper , we adopt @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "for the ensuing discussion we do not use @xmath70 .",
    "rather , we use values corrected by the factor @xmath127 and denote these corrected values by the symbol @xmath128 . these values are listed in table  [ barnardtable ] .",
    "equation  [ t4eqn ] shows that the values for @xmath129 listed in table  [ barnardtable ] are upper limits to the electron temperature because the reddening @xmath55 can not be negative .",
    "following our discussion above in section  [ lambdao1 ] , we assume that all of the extinction occurs in front of the hii region and adopt @xmath130 . for this choice , our upper limit becomes @xmath131 . by design ,",
    "this is consistent with @xmath97 ( section  [ absolutecal ] ) .",
    "this is considerably smaller than typical temperatures of hii regions near the sun . in particular ,",
    "the ori a and ori b hii regions have measurements of @xmath132 ranging from @xmath133 ( here the subscript @xmath134 means determined from the ratio of radio recombination lines to radio continuum ; see reifenstein et al 1970 , shaver et al 1983 ) .",
    "it is also smaller than the _ predicted _ temperatures : for `` standard '' abundances , osterbrock s ( 1989 ) figure 3.2 should be reasonably representative of the @xmath1 ori hii region and predicts an equilibrium temperature of @xmath135 .",
    "we now discuss this discrepancy between observed and predicted temperatures for the @xmath1 ori hii region .",
    "the temperature of an hii region is governed primarily by the abundances of nitrogen and oxygen .",
    "lowering the temperature from the predicted @xmath135 to @xmath136 requires that the cooling be increased by a factor of 1.3 . to attain the factor 1.3 ,",
    "the [ oii ] and/or [ nii ] abundance must increase by the factor 1.8 .",
    "it is very doubtful that this increase occurs because of an increased gas - phase abundance produced by grain destruction , because meyer et al ( 1997 , 1998 ) find that only @xmath137 of the o and @xmath138 of the n are locked up in grains .",
    "an alternative to the observed temperature being as low as 5700 k is the fraction [ n@xmath6/n ] being lower than unity , because the observed value @xmath97 relies on the assumption that n@xmath6/n = h@xmath6/h ( haffner et al 1999 ) .",
    "in fact , models by sembach et al ( 1999 ) suggest that this assumption is incorrect ; instead , n@xmath6/n = 0.7 h@xmath6/h .",
    "if this is correct , then the observed @xmath100 becomes @xmath139 .",
    "this raises the temperature of the @xmath1 ori hii region and makes it closer to , but still different from , the theoretical prediction .",
    "we do not understand the causes for the smaller temperature of the @xmath1 ori hii region .",
    "following our discussion above in section  [ bltop01 ] , we adopt @xmath140 .",
    "this makes the temperature equal to our upper limit , so @xmath141 .",
    "again , by design this is close to @xmath110 .",
    "our upper limit is @xmath142 .",
    "this is considerably higher than bl - top .",
    "we expect the physical conditions in bl - left and bl - top to be similar because they are part of the same structure ; this implies that the true temperature is lower than our raw measurements imply and that extinction is important . if bl - left has the same temperature as bl - top , then equation  [ t4eqn ] predicts @xmath143 mag .",
    "this set of conditions is entirely in line with the ratio of h@xmath0 to h@xmath144 line intensities , which we denote by @xmath145 .",
    "isobe ( 1978 ) presents a map of this ratio from which we estimate    @xmath146    and a good approximation to the ratio of line intensities ( martin 1988 ) is    @xmath147    these , together with the table  [ barnardtable ] s ratio of the slopes @xmath66 for the two regions , provide an independent estimate of the quantities @xmath148 and @xmath149 $ ] ; we obtain @xmath150 and @xmath151 mag , which agrees quite well with our above results .",
    "we conclude that bl - left has the same temperature as bl - top , @xmath152 .",
    "its reddening @xmath153 mag corresponds to a foreground @xmath154 @xmath103 .",
    "our upper limit is @xmath155 .",
    "the uncertainty is large , but an eyeball examination of figure  [ halfa_radioplot ] persuades us that this value is reliable and is statistically significantly higher than in the other regions .",
    "one spot in this region , @xmath156 , was observed by reynolds and ogden ( 1979 , entry 3 in table 1 ) ; these data give @xmath157 . applying equation  [ t4eqn ] , we find @xmath158 mag .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath159 @xmath103 , which in turn corresponds to a 100 @xmath7 m brightness of 28 mjy ster@xmath12 for the usual ir to hi conversion of schlegel , finkbeiner , and davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "the observed 100 @xmath7 m brightnesses are smaller than this , varying from @xmath160 mjy ster@xmath12 .",
    "this seeming discrepancy is not meaningful because the hi column density is large and , moreover , the ir emission per h - nucleus @xmath161 mjy ster@xmath12 @xmath162 , with the higher ratios correlated with the higher 100 @xmath7 m brightnesses , which implies the presence of h@xmath163 . under these dense conditions , the true column density exceeds that indicated by the ir emission as discussed in section  [ dirbefits ] .",
    "we adopt the reddening required to make @xmath70 match @xmath164 , 0.31 mag .",
    "this weakens the observed brightness by a factor @xmath165 . from figure  [ halfa_radioplot ]",
    ", we see that the observed h@xmath0 brightness is @xmath166 @xmath52 pc ; thus , the unabsorbed brightness @xmath167 @xmath52 pc .",
    "this makes the intrinsic optical brightness of filament @xmath168 the optical brightness of bl .",
    "ir emission traces the total warm / cold column density [ @xmath169 and 21-cm line emission traces the hi column density @xmath170 ; thus the appropriately - scaled difference traces [ @xmath171 . for h@xmath6 , note the important difference between its ir and h@xmath0 ( or radio ) emission : ir traces column density @xmath172 , while h@xmath0 traces emission measure @xmath173 .",
    "this means that the comparison provides @xmath2 .",
    "the important scaling factor is @xmath66 , the ir emission per hydrogen nucleus .",
    "the ir emission peaks near @xmath174 @xmath7 .",
    "global fits at 100 @xmath7 m typically obtain @xmath66 in the vicinity of 0.65 mjy ster@xmath12 @xmath162 ( schlegel et al 1998 ; reach , wall , and odegard 1998 ; heiles , haffner , and reynolds 1999 ) .",
    "here we adopt the somewhat lower value 0.62 of arendt et al ( 1998 ) because they obtained the full dirbe spectral coverage .",
    "let the emission per nucleus in ionized gas be @xmath175 . then , neglecting h@xmath163 , we have    @xmath176    to treat observational data , consider a least - squares fit for the the coefficients a , b , and c in the equation    @xmath177    here @xmath178 is the dirbe data , @xmath170 is the integrated 21-cm line intensity , and @xmath179 is from either the 2326 mhz data or the velocity - integrated h@xmath0 line intensity .",
    "comparing the last term in these equations gives    @xmath180    the radio data are better than the optical data for these fits because they have higher angular resolution and are unaffected by extinction ; their higher noise is unimportant because bl is intense .",
    "the radio and optical data give comparable results . in actual practice",
    "we do not fit equation  [ idealfit ] but instead    @xmath181    from equation  [ emradio ] it is clear that    @xmath182    where the numerical value is for @xmath183 , @xmath107 , and @xmath125 .",
    "reliable results require choosing appropriate regions , specifically ones with small @xmath170 and no h@xmath163 .",
    "high @xmath170 regions are unsuitable for three reasons : ( 1 ) their possible saturation of the 21-cm line makes it an invalid tracer of @xmath170 ; ( 2 ) their associated extinction shields the interior from starlight , making dust grains cooler and reducing the ir emission per h atom , and ( 3 ) their probable associated h@xmath163 provides extra dust unrelated to hi , increasing the ir emission per h atom .",
    "most of bl does not satisfy the low @xmath170 criterion because there are very dense background molecular clouds .",
    "nevertheless , we were able to locate two small portions of bl and its environs where molecular clouds are absent .",
    "these regions are outlined by dashed lines in figure  [ quad_diff ] .",
    "we performed fits at the six relevant dirbe wavelengths .",
    "figure  [ lsfitplot1 ] exhibits the logarithm of the ir emission in mjy ster@xmath12 per @xmath184 , where the subscript means units of @xmath185 @xmath103 ; this is equal to @xmath186 in equation  [ realfit ] .",
    "this figure also shows the global average spectrum determined by arendt et al ( 1998 ) .",
    "our spectrum agrees well with the global one .    at 100 @xmath7 m ,",
    "equation  [ neequation ] gives @xmath187 and @xmath188 @xmath4 for the top and bottom regions , respectively .",
    "these differ by @xmath189 , which we regard as fair agreement , and we adopt the average @xmath190 @xmath4 .    the ratio @xmath191 is the ratio of the h@xmath6 and hi ir spectra ; if this ratio depends on wavelength , then the grain emission spectrum differs for ionized and neutral gas .",
    "figure  [ lsfitplot ] exhibits this ratio as normalized to unity at @xmath192 @xmath7 m .",
    "the h@xmath6 spectrum differs significantly from the hi spectrum .",
    "relative to @xmath192 @xmath7 m , the 60 @xmath7 m points are definitely larger , and the 12 and 240 @xmath7 m points are probably smaller ( the errors are large , particularly at 240 @xmath7 m ) .",
    "our least - squares fit allows us to predict @xmath193 .",
    "thus the difference @xmath194 ( in least - squares terminology , the residual ) is an approximate measure of @xmath195 combined with the deviation of @xmath2 from its average , i.e.    @xmath196 \\ ; .\\ ] ]    there is also a minor contribution from saturation of the 21-cm line .",
    "the lower right - hand quadrant in figure  [ quad_diff ] maps this difference , which depends on two terms  the `` molecular '' and `` ionized '' terms",
    ". the ionized term can be positive or negative : it is negative in regions of large @xmath2 , where a small column density gives bright 2326 mhz emission .",
    "thus , dense hii regions would stand out as deficiencies in figure  [ quad_diff ] if they were not associated with molecular clouds .",
    "however , the dominant contribution to this image is clearly the orion molecular clouds , which produce the large , prominent burned - out bright blob .      above we adopted @xmath197 @xmath4 . the 2326 mhz brightness temperature @xmath198 k , which corresponds to @xmath199 @xmath52 pc .",
    "combining these with @xmath200 gives @xmath201 and path length @xmath202 pc .",
    "this path length is very long : bl is at the distance of orion , about 450 pc , so our 160 pc line - of - sight length is @xmath203 of the total distance .",
    "this , in turn , implies that bl is a cylinder that happens to have its axis accurately pointed towards us .",
    "this is not only deeply unsatisfying , but also at odds with what we would expect from the simple geometrical and physical model of a thick - walled spherical shell .    in the vicinity of the fitted regions ,",
    "bl has radius @xmath204 and apparent thickness @xmath205 ; these translate to lengths @xmath206 and @xmath207 pc .",
    "such a shell has a maximum tangential path length through its edge of @xmath208 pc .",
    "our derived path length exceeds this by a factor of 2.7 ; not only that , it exceeds even the diameter by a factor of 1.6 ! this discrepancy is the geometrical conundrum .",
    "clumping makes the conundrum even worse .",
    "suppose that the line of sight within bl contains clumps that occupy a fraction @xmath209 of the sightline .",
    "this does not affect any of our derived physical parameters , including @xmath210 ; however in this case @xmath210 refers to the length of the line of sight _ within the clumps_. the _ total _ length within which the clumps lie is @xmath211 .",
    "this makes the geometrical conundrum worse by a factor of @xmath209 .    to resolve the conundrum comfortably",
    ", we need to decrease @xmath210 to something less than its maximum of 60 pc . for discussion purposes",
    ", we will assume @xmath212 pc .",
    "this means we need to decrease our derived path length by a factor of 4 .",
    "suppose that ionized regions exhibit more grain emission per @xmath213 than neutral regions ; this means @xmath214 .",
    "this increases @xmath2 by the factor @xmath215 and decreases @xmath210 by the _ square _ of @xmath215 . to resolve the conundrum in a comfortable way",
    ", we need @xmath216 or @xmath217 .",
    "we adopt this as the resolution to the conundrum .",
    "thus , we adopt @xmath218 @xmath4 .",
    "bl has @xmath219 ; thus , @xmath220 .",
    "above in section  [ conundrum ] , we found the geometrical conundrum requires more 100 @xmath7 m ir emission per grain than in hi regions , and we adopted @xmath221 . and in section  [ irspectrum ] , we found the ir spectrum of bl to be different from that of hi .",
    "both the increased 100 @xmath7 m emission and the changed spectrum suggest that the bl grains are warmer than the hi grains . in the remainder of this section",
    ", we will explore this temperature increase .",
    "we shall assume that the _ number _ of 100 @xmath7 m emitting grains per h - nucleus is identical in bl and hi regions .",
    "we perform least square fits of the ir spectrum to determine the big grain temperature @xmath222 . in all fits",
    "we use a @xmath223 emissivity law and weight the points by the inverse square of the uncertainties . in hi regions , the @xmath224 @xmath7",
    "m radiation comes almost exclusively from big grains ( _ bg _ ) and 60 @xmath7 m radiation from very small grains ( _ vsg _ ; dsert , boulanger , and puget 1990 ) .",
    "these are two distinct grain populations and in solving for the temperature of @xmath192 @xmath7 m emitting grains we must consider only the bg s , i.e.  we must use ir intensities for @xmath225 @xmath7 m . for the three hi grain spectra in figure  [ lsfitplot1 ] we obtain @xmath226 k for the ( global , top , and bottom ) regions , respectively .",
    "these refer to hi regions .",
    "the uncertainties on our derived temperatures ( top , bottom ) are large , so below we will use the global @xmath227 k as a reference .    in bl ,",
    "figure  [ lsfitplot ] shows 60 @xmath7 m is much stronger than in hi regions by a factor of 1.9 to 3.4 .",
    "this can occur for two reasons .",
    "one , the population of vsg s is enhanced in bl relative to hi regions .",
    "two , the temperature of bg s is considerably larger in bl than in hi regions .",
    "below , we will least - squares fit the grain temperatures to the ir spectra for the h@xmath6 in bl ( top , bottom ) and exhibit the results in table  [ graintable ] .",
    "the table also displays two important related quantities .",
    "one is @xmath228 , the ratio of the 100 @xmath7 m emissivity at the derived @xmath222 in bl to that in the global hi .",
    "the other is @xmath229 : for a grain emissivity @xmath230 , this is the expected ratio of grain heating ( equal to total grain ir emission ) .    to begin",
    ", we suppose that the enhanced 60 @xmath7 m intensity in bl comes from bg s that are warm enough to overwhelm the vsg emission .",
    "therefore , in this fit we derive @xmath222 by including the amount of 60 @xmath7 m intensity that exceeds what we expect from the the vsg s , i.e.  the 60 @xmath7 m emission above the dotted line in figure  [ lsfitplot ] .",
    "for h@xmath6 in bl ( top , bottom ) we obtain @xmath231 k. these correspond to @xmath232 , which is much larger than the @xmath221 estimate above .",
    "this can be reconciled by making the clumping factor @xmath233 . if the physical path length over which the h@xmath6 is distributed is fixed at 40 pc , then @xmath234 ; if @xmath221 , as we argue above , then we require @xmath235 ^ 2 = ( 11.9 , 4.4)$ ] and the path lengths actually occupied by the h@xmath6 in bl are @xmath236 pc .",
    "this is a high degree of clumping , and we would expect to see considerable small - scale structure of the h@xmath0 emission within bl",
    ". however , the image presented by isobe ( 1973 ) does nt give this impression .",
    "we conclude that the enhanced 60 @xmath7 m intensity in bl does _ not _ come from warm bg s .",
    "we next consider the other alternative , namely that the enhanced 60 @xmath7 m comes from an enhanced population of vsg s . in this fit",
    ", we derive @xmath222 in the usual way , by including only the @xmath225 @xmath7 m data .",
    "for h@xmath6 in bl ( top , bottom ) we obtain @xmath231 k. these correspond to @xmath237 , which agrees well with the @xmath221 estimate above .",
    "these grains require an excess heating rate relative to global hi by factors of @xmath238 .",
    "this excess heating rate is very close to that expected from the added heating by l@xmath0 photons trapped in ionized gas .",
    "spitzer ( 1978 ) shows that this mean intensity of these photons is @xmath239 erg @xmath103 s@xmath12 str@xmath12 .",
    "the isrf is equivalent to a blackbody at 3.14 k ( mathis , mezger , and panagia 1983 ) , or @xmath240 erg @xmath103 s@xmath12 str@xmath12 . for @xmath241 @xmath103 ( section  [ conundrum ] ) , we have @xmath242 , which is close to the excess heating obtained in the above paragraph .",
    "we emphasize that this extra grain heating is a generally - occuring process in all @xmath243 regions that trap l@xmath0 photons ( the `` on - the - spot '' case ) . the h@xmath6 grain heating rate @xmath244 times larger than the hi grain heating rate .",
    "this translates into an increased ir emission per grain .",
    "we much prefer this second alternative because the it is consistent with the @xmath221 estimate obtained from our geometrical argument in section  [ conundrum ] .",
    "also , the increase in @xmath222 is modest and is attained with something close to the expected increase in grain heating rate .",
    "we conclude that the 60 @xmath7 m excess in the h@xmath6 of bl comes from an enhanced population of vsg s .",
    "in contrast , the relative 12 @xmath7 m intensity from bl is smaller than that from the global hi .",
    "this result is strongly suggested from figure  [ lsfitplot ] but , given the uncertainties , not absolutely certain .",
    "the 12 @xmath7 m emission comes from a third population of grains ; many workers , including dsert et al ( 1990 ) , believe they are pah s .",
    "we conclude that , with high probability , the population of pah s relative to bg s in the h@xmath6 gas of bl is smaller than in global hi .    our conclusions ,",
    "then , are that the vsg s are more abundant and the pah s less abundant in bl than in global hi .",
    "this is similar to but firmer than the results of dsert et al ( 1990 ) on the h@xmath6 gas in the california nebula .",
    "clearly , it would be desirable to confirm this trend by studying other hii regions .",
    "in section  [ barnardradiosection ] , we derived the radio spectral index of the barnard loop ( bl ) from large - scale radio surveys at four frequencies .",
    "we eliminated possible scale errors by assuming the hii region @xmath1 ori to be a thermal ( optically thin bremstrahlung ) radio source .",
    "we found bl to have a thermal spectrum , too .",
    "having found the radio emission of bl to be thermal , we could combine the radio and h@xmath0 line data in section  [ barnardrjrsection ] to derive upper limits on the electron temperature ( table  [ barnardtable ] ) for four regions : the @xmath1 ori hii region , two regions in bl , and a high - latitude filament in the wall of the orion - eridanus superbubble . in section  [ absolutecal ]",
    "we discussed two of these regions in detail and compared our temperatures with those previously obtained from nii and h@xmath0 line ratios .",
    "our currently - derived temperatures were lower than the previous ones .",
    "we developed a toy model to explore the effect of temperature structure along the line of sight , and found that one expects the radio / h@xmath0 temperatures to be somewhat smaller than the nii / h@xmath0 temperatures .",
    "however , most of the discrepancy is a result of inaccurate absolute intensity calilbrations .",
    "provisionally , we accepted the 2326 mhz radio survey calibration as accurate ( jonas et al 1998 ) and ascribed all the error to the wham survey data , whose final calibration has not yet been done ; the current wham intensities need to be multiplied by the factor 0.89 .",
    "we discussed the four regions in some detail and adopted reddenings , which enabled us to derive actual electron temperatures ( table  [ barnardtable ] ) .",
    "temperatures in all four regions are somewhat smaller than in the orion nebula and other hii regions near the sun .",
    "in section  [ dirbefits ] we performed least - squares fits of the dirbe diffuse ir intensities to the 21-cm line and radio continuum intensities .",
    "our derived ir spectrum spans @xmath245 @xmath7 m and agrees well with the spectrum from global hi derived by arendt et al ( 1998 ) . in this fit , the ratio of the derived coefficients of the 21-cm line and radio continuum allow one to determine the electron density @xmath2 .",
    "however , our derived @xmath2 is small , requiring a very long path length through the h@xmath0 emitting region , which is inconsistent with the bl morphology and leads to the `` geometrical conundrum '' of section  [ conundrum ] .",
    "the conundrum can be resolved if the h@xmath6 grains emit more ir per h - nucleus than hi grains do .",
    "this , together with the modified ir spectrum from the h@xmath6 gas , is explained in section  [ warmgrains ] by a higher grain temperature in the h@xmath6 than in the hi ( @xmath222 in table  [ graintable ] : hi is the first entry , h@xmath6 the last two entries ) .",
    "the increased grain temperature in the h@xmath6 gas agrees well with that expected from the extra heating produced by trapped l@xmath0 photons .",
    "the h@xmath6 grain heating rate is generally higher than the hi heating rate by a factor @xmath246 .    in bl ,",
    "@xmath3 @xmath4 and @xmath247 k. the pressure is @xmath5 @xmath4 k. in addition , the h@xmath6 grains in bl exhibit excess 60 @xmath7 m emission and deficient 12 @xmath7 m emission , indicating that very small grains ( vsg s ) are more abundant and pah s less abundant in bl than in the global hi .",
