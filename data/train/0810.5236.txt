    "a major test of the large @xmath2 ads / cft correspondence  @xcite is the matching of the spectrum of the scaling dimensions of single trace operators in @xmath0 super yang - mills ( sym ) and the energies of single strings propagating in @xmath1",
    ".    many features of the spectrum of single trace operators can be understood by treating it as a lattice model .",
    "this is most easily understood in the @xmath3 sector , which consists of operators built out of the scalars @xmath4 and @xmath5 . here",
    "the operators can then be mapped to simple spin - chains . as realized by minahan and zarembo  @xcite",
    ", the one - loop dilation operator in this sector equals the hamiltonian of the heisenberg @xmath3 spin - chain .",
    "if we let @xmath4 represent spin up and @xmath5 represent spin down , a ferromagnetic ground state of a chain of length @xmath6 is given by @xmath7 this is a bps state with classical dimension @xmath8 and vanishing anomalous dimension .",
    "non - bps operators can be built out of this ground state by changing some of the @xmath4:s into @xmath5:s . in the spin - chain picture",
    "each such impurity corresponds to a magnon , a single fundamental excitation traveling along the chain with a certain momentum .    for an infinitely long chain , for @xmath9 , the spectrum consists of states with any number of magnons having arbitrary momenta .",
    "the contribution of each magnon to the scaling dimension , the dispersion relation of the magnons , is is related to the t hooft coupling @xmath10 by @xmath11 . ]",
    "@xcite @xmath12    for finite @xmath6 , we need to take into account the periodic boundary conditions . in an integrable system such as the heisenberg spin - chain",
    ", this leads to quantization of the momenta , which now satisfy bethe equations of the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the two - body s - matrix .",
    "hence the finite @xmath6 spectrum is highly dependent on the magnon interactions .",
    "to get a gauge independent operator from a spin - chain state , we need to take a trace . taking into account the cyclicity of the trace",
    ", we will consider only spin - chain states that are symmetric under shifts of the spin sites .",
    "this leads to the level - matching condition @xmath15    the success of this bethe ansatz for the @xmath3 sector relies on the similarity between the one - loop dilation operator in this sector and the integrable heisenberg hamiltonian .",
    "miraculously there are many indications that even the all - loop dilatation operator of the full large @xmath2 @xmath0 sym is integrable .",
    "hence it is possible to describe the full spectrum of single trace gauge invariant operators by a bethe ansatz  @xcite .",
    "however the bethe ansatz is only valid for asymptotically long operators .",
    "the range of the interaction terms in the dilatation operator grow with the loop order .",
    "for short operators finite size corrections are expected to appear in the form of wrapping interactions .",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite analyzed wrapping effects using the thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) .",
    "they found that for an operator of length @xmath16 , wrapping effects will generically appear at @xmath16 loops .",
    "recently much work has been put into calculating these corrections .",
    "the simplest operator with a non - zero anomalous dimension is the konishi operator .",
    "the dimension of this operator has been calculated to four loop order directly from the gauge theory @xcite as well as using tba  @xcite , and the results of these calculations were found to agree perfectly .",
    "by considering string states in @xmath17 we find the duals of operators in the @xmath3 sector of the gauge theory . the r - charge @xmath6 now measures the angular momentum around the sphere .",
    "the simplest solution describes a point - like string spinning around a great circle .",
    "this supersymmetric state with @xmath8 is the dual of the spin - chain ground state .",
    "having identified the dual of the ground state the next step is to search for excitations .",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite considered the limit where @xmath18 with @xmath19 fixed , and showed that the semi - classical fluctuations around the ground state reproduce the leading order gauge theory spectrum in this limit .",
    "another possibility would be to let @xmath9 while keeping @xmath20 large but fixed .",
    "hofman and maldacena  @xcite looked for classical solutions such that the difference @xmath21 remains finite .",
    "they found a solution given by a world - sheet soliton . in space - time , the solution describes a string with end - points fixed on the equator with a constant angular separation @xmath22 , which is interpreted as the momentum @xmath23 of the excitation . using a conformal gauge where the @xmath6 density is constant on the world - sheet , the world - sheet is infinitely large .",
    "the energy of the excited state is @xmath24 which agrees with the large @xmath20 limit of the gauge theory result .",
    "the situation is thus very similar to that of small fluctuations around an infinitely long spin chain .",
    "the giant magnon solution seems to describes an open string in a closed string theory .",
    "however , a single magnon does not describe a physical configuration .",
    "like in the gauge theory , physical states satisfy the level - matching condition . with an infinite world - sheet we can however relax this condition and consider a single magnon .",
    ", single magnon states of momentum the form @xmath25 are physical if treated on a @xmath26 orbifold , see  @xcite . ]",
    "one approach to deriving the giant magnon dispersion relation is by constructing a finite gap solution  @xcite .",
    "a classical solution to the equations of motion of the string is described by a meromorphic function @xmath27 , called the _ quasi - momentum _ , defined on a two - sheeted riemann surface .",
    "the charges of the string depend on the analytical structure of @xmath27 .",
    "the possible singularities are square root branch cuts @xmath28 and logarithmic branch cuts @xmath29 , conventionally referred to as _",
    "condensates_. if @xmath27 has a square root branch cut along @xmath28 it satisfies @xmath30 where @xmath27 is to be evaluated once on each side of the cut .",
    "the quantum numbers of a particular string configuration can be read off from the asymptotic behavior of the corresponding quasi - momentum . the conserved charges @xmath6 and @xmath31 correspond to the isometries of the three - sphere . for solutions made up of giant magnons ,",
    "@xmath31 counts the number of magnon constituents , with @xmath32 corresponding to a fundamental magnon and larger @xmath31 corresponding to magnon bound states .",
    "] , @xmath33 let us now consider a configuration consisting of a single condensate and make the ansatz @xmath34    @xmath27 has a single logarithmic cut between @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the poles at @xmath37 already have the correct residues . to get the right asymptotic behavior as @xmath38 we have to solve the equations @xmath39 solving these equations for @xmath40",
    "gives @xmath41 plugging this back , solving for @xmath21 and setting @xmath42 gives the dispersion relation @xmath43    to better understand how we arrived at this result , we consider an alternative finite gap derivation due to vicedo  @xcite . in this formalism a solution to the classical equations of motion is encoded in terms of a meromorphic differential on a riemann surface .",
    "consider an elliptic , or two gap , solution , a solution with a genus one riemann surface .",
    "this surface can be described as a two sheeted surface with two square root branch cuts connecting the points @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    , @xmath46 and @xmath47 . ]    defining the periods @xmath48 and @xmath47 as in figure  [ fig : ab - periods ] , the differential @xmath49 will be subject to the following periodicity constraints @xmath50 in the singular limit where @xmath51 , the @xmath47 period encircles the endpoint @xmath35 once . to satisfy the periodicity condition , @xmath49 has to have a simple pole of residue @xmath52 at @xmath35 .",
    "the expressions for the global charges in terms of @xmath49 now easily gives the giant magnon dispersion relation  @xcite .",
    "thus a single giant magnon can be seen as a singular limit of an elliptic string state .",
    "hence we have two configurations corresponding to a giant magnon  a single condensate or two cuts sharing endpoints .",
    "as noted by vicedo , the two descriptions are related by @xmath53 transformations , which exchange how the square root branch points are connected to form cuts .",
    "performing such a transformation on a general finite gap solution gives a new solution , which corresponds to the same solution of the equations of motion for the string , provided the @xmath54- and @xmath47-periods of @xmath49 are preserved . to ensure this",
    "we may need to add extra condensates to the transformed solution .",
    "in the previous section , we considered string solutions with one spin infinitely large , corresponding , in conformal gauge , to an infinitely long world sheet . for states with finite spin",
    "we expect the energy to receive finite size corrections , analogous to the wrapping interactions in gauge theory . at large coupling these corrections",
    "are expected to be exponentially suppressed in the string length @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this was confirmed for the magnon by arutyunov _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite who derived an explicit generalization of the giant magnon solution .",
    "they found corrections to the dispersion relation of the form @xmath55 this result was later confirmed by janik and ukowski  @xcite , using the thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) and the related lscher formulas for finite size corrections in two - dimensional quantum field theories .",
    "we can also imagine string states consisting of several magnons .",
    "hofman and maldacena  @xcite showed that for infinite @xmath6 , magnons can scatter against each other with a two - particle s - matrix which agrees with the @xmath56 s - matrix of the gauge theory .",
    "the energy of these multi - magnon states is however simply the sum of the individual magnon energies . in the gauge theory we saw that for finite size states , interaction between the magnons",
    "affected both the allowed sets of momenta and the total anomalous dimension .",
    "hence it would be interesting to see how the magnon interactions effect the spectrum on the string side .",
    "the description of interacting string states is in general a very complicated problem . from the point of view of the finite gap equations , we noted previously that a single giant magnon is a two gap solution .",
    "a state of @xmath57 giant magnons corresponds to a solution with @xmath58 cuts , and will hence be given as a function on a riemann surface of genus @xmath59 , which generally has to be expressed in terms of hyperelliptic functions .",
    "as noted above , the giant magnon in the infinite spin limit can be regarded as a finite gap solution consisting of a single condensate , resulting in a logarithmic resolvent , instead of the expected elliptic form of a generic two gap solution . a state of several magnons is now given by a number of such condensates . to see how this effects the solution",
    ", we note that the only equation that induces interactions between different cuts is eq .  , which describes the discontinuity of @xmath27 along a square root branch cut .",
    "but this equation only involves square root cuts , and hence the many magnon solution is simply a sum of the individual solutions , resulting in an additive total energy , @xmath60 .",
    "a giant magnon could also be described as a singular limit of a two - cut solution . in this picture",
    "we expect finite size corrections to arise when we let the endpoints of the two cuts be very close to each other .",
    "hence we will consider two square root branch cuts with a separation of length @xmath61 between the endpoints . performing an @xmath53 transformation on this configuration we end up with a single condensate @xmath62 with square root branch cuts @xmath63 and @xmath64 of length @xmath61 attached at each end  @xcite , as depicted in figure  [ fig : recut ] .",
    "magnon as a two cut solution ( left ) , and as a condensate with cuts at the ends ( right ) .",
    "the two configurations are related by an @xmath53 transformation . ]    as an ansatz for the resolvent @xmath65 of a set of finite size magnons we write  @xcite .",
    "a very similar construction was also used in  @xcite to calculate finite size corrections at the one - loop level . ] .",
    "@xmath66 the square root cuts of @xmath67 are such that the relative sign in the numerator ( denominator ) changes when we cross @xmath63 ( @xmath68 ) . as a simple check of this ansatz we can let @xmath69 to recover the previous giant magnon resolvent .",
    "since we are interested in the leading order corrections , we make an expansion by setting @xmath70 where @xmath71 is real .",
    "we also need to take into account the back - reaction of @xmath72 by expanding it around @xmath73 . calculating the asymptotic behavior as @xmath74 and @xmath75 and solving the resulting equations iteratively to the second order in @xmath73 by requiring that @xmath76 and @xmath77",
    "receive no corrections , we get the correction will be put to zero .",
    "dyonic magnons with @xmath78 were treated in the same fashion in  @xcite .",
    "this case was also independently treated by hatsuda and suzuki  @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath79    so far there has been no contribution from the interactions between the magnons",
    ". however we still have to determine the parameters @xmath73 and @xmath80",
    ". we will do that by ensuring that the cuts really correspond to square root branch cuts , requiring that they satisfy .",
    "thus we need to calculate @xmath81 for @xmath82 on a cut @xmath63 to the leading order in @xmath73 .",
    "solving the resulting equation for @xmath73 , we get @xmath83 inserting this into the above expression for the correction to the dispersion relation we get the final result @xmath84 the exponential suppression , as well as the pre - factor , agrees with the one - magnon result in .",
    "the correction is changed by the magnon interactions by a multiplicative factor of order one , which is very similar in form to the two magnon scattering phase in  @xcite .",
    "interacting magnons can also be studied using the correspondence between the equations of motions for an @xmath85 sigma model and those of the sine - gordon model .",
    "hofman and maldacena used this to calculate the magnon @xmath86-matrix .",
    "klose and mcloughlin  @xcite considered periodic two - phase solutions to the sine - gordon equation .",
    "these solutions can be interpreted as interacting finite two - magnon solutions .",
    "the resulting solutions turned out to be elliptic , rather than hyperelliptic , which considerably simplified the problem .",
    "the corrections to the dispersion relation perfectly agrees with the one calculated in the previous sections .",
    "the finite size corrections to the multi - magnon energy has also been calculated using a generalization of the lscher rules @xcite . again",
    "the result agree with the finite size calculation .",
    "the spectrum of long operators in @xmath0 sym and for large spin states in the dual string theory is by now well known .",
    "the next step in finding the full spectra is the understanding of the finite size corrections to these states .",
    "the giant magnon can be seen as a fundamental excitation on the string world - sheet , dual to impurities propagating in the spin - chain picture . at infinite @xmath6 the spectra of both theories",
    "consists of states with magnons with arbitrary momenta ( up to level - matching ) .",
    "the magnons may scatter against each other , but the total energy is given as a sum of the energies of the corresponding free magnons .    for finite @xmath6",
    "the dispersion relation of the spin - chain impurities receives wrapping corrections due to virtual excitations travelling around the chain .",
    "in addition the allowed momenta become quantized through a bethe equation .",
    "the interaction between the magnons gives essential contributions to both of these corrections .",
    "the dispersion relation of a single giant magnon gets exponential corrections at finite @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "again these corrections stem from virtual excitations wrapping the world - sheet @xcite .",
    "the energy of a multi - magnon state is however not the sum of the individual energies . in this paper",
    ", the finite - gap calculation of the leading order contribution from magnon interactions has been reviewed .",
    "the resulting order - one factors are related to the two magnon s - matrix .    as in the gauge theory",
    ", we expect the momenta of finite @xmath6 giant magnons to be quantized in terms of the magnon s - matrix .",
    "the exact nature of this quantization remains an unsolved problem .",
    "the solution would deepen the understanding of the relation between the perturbative gauge and string theories .",
