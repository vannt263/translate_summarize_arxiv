    "now that there is more and more compelling evidence that the discovery in the atlas and cms experiments at the lhc is a higgs particle with a mass @xmath8 @xcite , one of the main focuses of particle physics is an understanding of the still elusive nature of dark matter ( dm ) , believed to account for about 26% of the energy content of the universe @xcite .",
    "side by side with observation , models beyond the standard model ( sm ) are devised to account for weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) as plausible candidates for dark matter .",
    "such models range from the sophisticated ones , those bearing intricate underlying symmetries and mechanisms of symmetry breaking , to the more simpler ones , those extending the sm without any particular assumption regarding a deeper structure .",
    "since the findings at the lhc have so far yielded no particular clue as to possible particle structures beyond those of the standard model , it is therefore still consistent to try to recognize dark matter as simple wimps extending the standard model , with no further assumptions as to inner structures .",
    "the simplest of such extensions is a one real electroweak - singlet scalar field , interacting with visible matter only via the sm higgs particle , first proposed by silveira and zee @xcite and further studied in @xcite . in this minimal model , with dm masses lighter than @xmath9 , the higgs would be mainly invisible , which is excluded by the recent measurement of the higgs signal at the lhc @xcite .",
    "also , for dm masses in the range @xmath10 , the model is ruled out by the data from xenon  10 @xcite and cdms ii @xcite , except around the resonance @xmath11 at which the higgs - dm coupling is extremely small .",
    "furthermore , dmmasses between @xmath12 and @xmath13 are excluded in this one - singlet extension by the xenon 100 experiment @xcite .",
    "note that similar conclusions hold also for a complex scalar singlet extension of the sm @xcite .",
    "so , given the difficulties this minimal model has with existing experimental and observational dm data @xcite , we have proposed in @xcite an extension to the standard model with two real electroweak singlets , one being stable , the dm candidate , and the other an auxiliary field with a spontaneously broken @xmath14 symmetry .",
    "based on the dm relic - density and wimp direct detection studies , we have concluded that this two - singlet model is capable of bearing dark matter in a large region of the parameter space .",
    "further constraints on the model as well as some of its phenomenological implications have been studied in @xcite where rare meson decays and higgs production channels have been considered .    in the present work , we further the study of the two - singlet model and ask how high in the energy scale it is computationally reliable .",
    "a  standard treatment is the investigation of the running of the coupling constants in terms of the mass scale @xmath15 via the renorrmalization group equations ( rge ) .",
    "we believe one - loop calculations are amply sufficient for the present task ; higher loops could be considered if the situation changes .    the two standard issues to monitor are the perturbativity of the scalar coupling constants and the vacuum stability of the theory .",
    "these issues were studied in @xcite for the complex scalar singlet extension of the sm , and it was shown that the vacuum - stability requirement can affect the dm relic density .",
    "specific results from such studies depend on the cutoff scale @xmath16 of the theory .",
    "reversely , imposing perturbativity and vacuum stability may indicate at what @xmath16 the two - singlet extension is valid . in the early parts of this work , the second point of view",
    "is adopted , whereas in the later part , the first is taken .",
    "furthermore , up to only recently , it has been anticipated that new physics  such as supersymmetry would appear at the lhc at the scale @xmath17 .",
    "present results from atlas and cms indicate no such signs yet .",
    "one consequence of this is that the cutoff scale @xmath16 may be higher . as we shall discuss",
    ", we find that it can be @xmath18 .",
    "this work is organized as follows .",
    "after this introduction , we recapitulate in section ii the essentials of the two - singlet model necessary for the rge calculations . in section iii , we discuss the running of the scalar coupling constants when we switch off the non - higgs sm particles .",
    "this gives us a first understanding of how high in the energy scale perturbativity is allowed .",
    "it helps also seeing the subsequent effects of the other sm particles .",
    "section iv discusses the full rges .",
    "vacuum stability gets into focus with the higgs coupling constant turning negative at some scale .",
    "the mass scales at which non - perturbativity and non - stability set in are different , and so a choice for @xmath16 has to be made .",
    "section v attempts at finding the regions in the parameter space in which the model is predictive .",
    "in addition to the dm relic - density constraint and the perturbativity - stability criteria deduced from the previous two sections , we impose on the model to be within the current direct - detection experimental bounds .",
    "section vi is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "the model is obtained by adding to the standard model two real , spinless , and @xmath14-symmetric sm - gauge - singlet fields .",
    "one is the dark matter field @xmath19 with unbroken @xmath14 symmetry , and the other an auxiliary field @xmath20 with spontaneously broken @xmath14 symmetry .",
    "both fields interact with the sm particles via the higgs doublet @xmath21 .",
    "using the same notation as in @xcite , the potential function that involves @xmath19 , @xmath22 and @xmath20 is : @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25and @xmath26 and all the coupling constants are real positive numbers ) . ] .",
    "we are interested in monitoring the running of the scalar coupling constants .",
    "a one - loop renormalization - group calculation yields the following @xmath27-functions : @xmath28 as usual , @xmath29 where @xmath15 is the running mass scale , starting from @xmath30 .",
    "the constants @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the sm and strong gauge couplings , known @xcite and given to one - loop order by the expression : @xmath34 where @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , @xmath37 for @xmath38 respectively .",

    "note that we are taking into consideration the fact that the top - quark contribution is dominant over that of the other fermions of the standard model .",

    "there are originally nine free physical parameters .",
    "the two vevs @xmath42 and @xmath45 are fixed , as well as the mass of the physical higgs field @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "also , the physical mutual coupling constant @xmath50 between @xmath51 and @xmath47 is determined by the dm relic - density constraint @xcite , which translates into the condition : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the thermally averaged annihilation cross - section of a pair of two dm particles times their relative speed in the center - of - mass reference frame .",
    "this constraint is imposed throughout this work , together with the perturbativity restriction @xmath54 on its solution .",
    "the remaining free parameters of the model are the physical mutual coupling constant @xmath55 between @xmath2 and @xmath19 , the mixing angle @xmath1 between @xmath2 and @xmath47 , the dm mass @xmath56 , the mass @xmath57 of the auxiliary physical field @xmath47 , and the dm self - coupling constant @xmath58 .",
    "this latter has so far been decoupled from the other coupling constants @xcite , but not anymore in view of ( [ beta - functions - scalars ] ) now that the running is the focus .",
    "however , its initial value @xmath59 is arbitrary and its @xmath27-function is always positive .",
    "this means @xmath60 will only increase as @xmath15 increases , quickly if starting from a rather large initial value , slowly if not .",
    "therefore , without loosing generality in the subsequent discussion , we fix @xmath61 .",

    "indeed , compare fig .",
    "[ rge - dens10_lambda04 - 01_theta-15_tm-6_v2 ] for which @xmath142 and @xmath95 @xmath143 with fig .",
    "[ rge - dens10_lambda04 - 001_theta-15_tm-6_v2 ] .",
    "we see shrunk regions , pushed downward by a few gevs , which is not a substantial relocation .",
    "remember that increasing @xmath3 raises @xmath144 well enough above 1 so that this latter will leave the perturbativity region sooner .",
    "increasing it is also caught up by the relic - density constraint , which tends to shut down such larger values of @xmath3 when the dark - matter mass @xmath56 is large .",
    "the direct - detection constraint has also a similar effect .",
    "in this work , we have studied the effects and consequences of the renormalization group equations at one - loop order on a two - singlet model of cold dark matter that consists in extending the standard model with two real gauge - singlet scalar fields .",
    "the two issues we monitored are perturbativity and vacuum stability .",
    "the former is controlled by the auxiliary - field self - coupling @xmath69 and the mutual coupling @xmath81 between the dark matter and the auxiliary fields .",
    "the latter is controlled by the higgs self - coupling @xmath74 . when the non - higgs sm coupling constants are switched off , all scalar couplings are positive increasing functions of the scale @xmath15 . reintroducing them",
    "flattens the rates for all the scalar couplings and makes the higgs coupling @xmath74 turn negative at some scale .",
    "the mutual couplings @xmath77 ( dm - higgs ) and @xmath72 ( higgs - auxiliary ) stay always well below one , whereas @xmath81 boosts up for larger @xmath56 ( dm mass ) and/or @xmath57 ( auxiliary - field mass ) , dominating over @xmath69 in some regions .",
    "we then have investigated the regions in the space of parameters in which the model is viable .",
    "we have plotted these regions in the ( @xmath145)-plane while varying the physical mutual coupling @xmath55 between the dark matter @xmath19 and the physical higgs @xmath2 , and the mixing angle @xmath1 between @xmath2 and the physical auxiliary field .",
    "we have required that the model reproduces the dm relic density abundance , and that it complies with the measured direct - detection upper bounds  those of the xenon 100 experiment .",
    "we have also imposed the rge perturbativity and vacuum - stability criteria that we deduced from this work together with a maximum cutoff @xmath124 , a scale at which heavy degrees of freedom may start to be relevant , something that could be probed by future colliders .",
    "this analysis has shown that for small @xmath55 and @xmath1 , the auxiliary - field mass @xmath57 is confined to the interval @xmath4 , while the dm mass @xmath56 is confined mainly to the region above @xmath137 ,  with a small showing in the narrow interval @xmath138 .",
    "increasing @xmath1 enriches the existing viability regions without relocating them , while increasing@xmath146 has the opposite effect , that of shrinking them without substantial relocation .",
    "it is pertinent at this stage to comment on the implications of the higgs discovery at the lhc on the possibility of having a light dark matter wimp @xmath19 with a mass @xmath147 , a situation allowed in this two - singlet model .",
    "indeed , on the one hand , for such a light dark matter , the decay channel @xmath148 becomes open , and therefore will lower the number of higgs decays into sm particles . on the other hand ,",
    "the atlas and cms published data on higgs boson searches seem to indicate that the observed boson is sm - like , and so , one expects to have stringent constraints on the parameter space when it comes to light dark - matter masses . in @xcite , a global fit to the higgs boson data that includes those presented at the moriond 2013 conference by the atlas and",
    "cms collaborations @xcite has been performed ; see @xcite for earlier fits . it has been found that any extra invisible higgs boson decay must be bounded by the following condition on the corresponding branching ratio : @xmath149 it turns out that in our two - singlet model , the branching fraction of the invisible width of the higgs boson is smaller than the bound above for @xmath147 . indeed ,",
    "if we take for example @xmath150 used frequently in this work , the ratio @xmath151 is less than @xmath152 , quite consistent with the above current bound .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the two - singlet model is consistent with the current available data regarding the higgs boson searches .    finally , we ask whether the model allows for very light cold dark matter .",
    "below @xmath7 , direct detection puts no experimental bound on the total cross section @xmath131 for non - relativistic elastic scattering of a dark matter wimp off a nucleon target .",
    "such a situation allows for very small @xmath56 regions of viability , but only when @xmath6 is quite large ( @xmath153 and above ) and @xmath1 not too small ( @xmath154 and above ) .",
    "however , for such values of the parameters , the branching fraction of the invisible higgs decay is larger than @xmath155 , which is excluded by the current lhc available data .                c.  bird , p.  jackson , r.  v.  kowalewski , and m.  pospelov , phys .",
