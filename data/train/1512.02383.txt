    "one of the most fundamental features of quantum mechanics is the fact that it is impossible to prepare states that have sufficiently precise simultaneous values of incompatible observables .",
    "the most well - known form of this statement is the position - momentum uncertainty relation @xmath0 , which places a lower bound on the product of standard deviations of the position and momentum observables , for a particle in any possible quantum state .",
    "this relation was first formalised by kennard  @xcite during the formative years of quantum mechanics following heisenberg s discussion of his `` uncertainty principle ''  @xcite .",
    "this `` uncertainty relation '' was quickly generalised by robertson  @xcite to arbitrary pairs of incompatible ( i.e. ,  non - commuting ) observables @xmath1 and @xmath2 into what is now the textbook uncertainty relation .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath2 be two observables and @xmath3=ab - ba$ ] their commutator . if the standard deviations @xmath4 and @xmath5 for a system in the state @xmath6 are defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 $ ] , then robertson s uncertainty relation can be expressed as @xmath9}\\right|.\\ ] ]    these uncertainty relations express a quantitative statement about the measurement statistics for @xmath1 and @xmath2 when they are _ measured many times , separately , on identically prepared quantum systems_. such relations are hence sometimes called _ preparation uncertainty relations _",
    ", since they propose fundamental limits on the measurement statistics for any state preparation .",
    "this is in contrast to heisenberg s original discussion of his uncertainty principle which he expressed as the inability to _ simultaneously measure _ incompatible observables with arbitrary accuracy . as such , quantum uncertainty relations have a long history of being misinterpreted as statements about joint measurements .",
    "it is only much more recently that progress has been made in formalising _",
    "measurement uncertainty relations _ that quantify measurement disturbance in this way , although there continues to be some debate as to the appropriate measure of measurement ( in)accuracy and of disturbance  @xcite .",
    "the recent interest in measurement uncertainty relations has highlighted an oft - overlooked aspect of robertson s inequality  : its _ state dependence_. indeed , the right - hand side of eq .",
    "depends on the expectation value @xmath10}\\right|$ ] , which itself depends on the state @xmath6 of the system and may be zero even for non - commuting @xmath1 and @xmath2 . to illustrate this , consider a spin-@xmath11 particle and measurement of pauli - spin operators @xmath12 .",
    "robertson s inequality gives us @xmath13}\\right|=|\\braket{\\sigma_z}|,\\ ] ] where the right - hand side is zero for any state @xmath14 ( with @xmath15 , and with @xmath16 denoting the identity operator ) , even though for @xmath17 and @xmath18 both @xmath19 and @xmath20 are strictly positive .",
    "robertson s inequalities , like other historical inequalities such as those due to schrdinger  @xcite , therefore often tell us little about the accuracy with which one can prepare a state with respect to two incompatible observables @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "there are two distinct issues with such inequalities : their triviality for certain states , and the state dependence itself .",
    "the first issue can , in some cases , be avoided by considering more complicated expressions or different measures of incompatibility  @xcite .",
    "this approach can be used to give non - trivial state - dependent uncertainty relations , which have the property that they can be experimentally verified without knowing the observables @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and thus are of interest for device - independent cryptography  @xcite . however , one may equally be interested in knowing how accurately one can prepare a state with respect to two given incompatible observables @xmath1 and @xmath2  that is , in characterising the `` minimum uncertainty '' states of a system .",
    "in such a situation , one ideally wants an uncertainty relation that depends on the state of the system only via the ( operationally defined ) measures of uncertainty , which ensures that the relation is an operational statement constraining the uncertainties directly , and can be evaluated without prior knowledge of the system s state .",
    "this is indeed the case , for example , with the position - momentum uncertainty relation described earlier .",
    "it thus makes sense to look for tighter , _ state - independent _ relations capable of addressing these issues , and it is this situation we tackle in this paper .      it has long been known that an alternative form of uncertainty relation can be given by considering the entropies of the observables rather than their standard deviations  @xcite .",
    "it was deutsch who first realised that such entropic uncertainty relations can be used to provide state - independent relations  @xcite , and thus avoid the problems with traditional relations discussed above .    rather than placing lower bounds on the product of variances of two observables @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    ", entropic uncertainty relations generally place bounds on the sum of the entropies of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "although many different entropies can be used to formulate such inequalities , perhaps the most well known one , due to maassen and uffink  @xcite , makes use of the shannon entropy .",
    "if @xmath1 has a spectral decomposition @xmath21 in terms of projectors @xmath22 ( with @xmath23 ) then the shannon entropy of @xmath1 for a system in a state @xmath6 is defined as @xmath24\\log\\big(\\operatorname{tr}[\\rho\\ , p_i]\\big),\\ ] ] which can be seen as a measure of the uncertainty in @xmath1 for the state @xmath6 . following the information - theoretical convention we take the logarithms in base 2 , although any base can be used as long as the choice is consistent .",
    "maassen and uffink s inequality can then be stated as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the maximum overlap between the eigenvectors @xmath27 and @xmath28 of @xmath1 and @xmath2 . the lower bound is thus state _ independent _ , and depends only on the unitary operator connecting the eigenbases of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "although this is a significant conceptual improvement over state - dependent relations , it is not optimal since the bound can not be saturated except for well - chosen @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "many variations and improvements on this relation have been found ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) but , without imposing further restrictions , tight bounds have proved elusive . in the two dimensional case ( i.e. , for qubit measurements ) ,",
    "several papers have improved on this bound  @xcite to determine the optimal lower bound on the sum @xmath29 for arbitrary qubit observables @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "this result was further generalised to a range of higher dimensional systems in ref .",
    "however , these bounds are not tight in the sense that , although there exist states that saturate the bound , there exist pairs of entropy values @xmath30 that satisfy the uncertainty relation but are not permitted by quantum mechanics .    in order to fully characterise the obtainable uncertainties ,",
    "it is thus necessary to consider functions of @xmath31 and @xmath32 beyond their sum ; indeed , there is no _ a priori _ reason why one should only consider entropic uncertainty relations based on the sum @xmath29 .",
    "much more recent work  @xcite has made progress in this direction working with more general rnyi entropies , and presents several conjectures and numerical results beyond two dimensions .",
    "the growth of interest in measurement uncertainty relations has prompted renewed interest in the possibility of state - independent uncertainty relations for the standard deviations of observables , rather than entropic relations  @xcite .",
    "particular attention has been devoted to understanding the simplest case of qubit uncertainty relations , and we continue this line of research in this paper",
    ".    it will be convenient to use the bloch sphere representation .",
    "for the two - dimensional case of qubits , an arbitrary @xmath33-valued observable  a `` pauli observable ''  @xmath1 can be written @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is a unit vector .",
    "similarly , an arbitrary state @xmath6 can be written @xmath37 , where @xmath38 if @xmath6 is a pure state and @xmath39 for mixed states .",
    "busch et al .  @xcite proved two state - independent uncertainty relations for arbitrary pauli measurements @xmath34 and @xmath40 , showing that @xmath41 and @xmath42 although these state - independent relations can be saturated by certain states , neither are tight in the sense discussed in the previous section .",
    "that is , there exist pairs of values @xmath43 which are allowed by the relations but not realisable by any quantum state @xmath6 .",
    "in this paper we aim precisely to provide _ tight _ state - independent uncertainty relations , so as to fully characterise the set of allowed values of @xmath44 , for all possible states @xmath6  which we shall call the `` _ _ uncertainty region _ _ '' . in ref .",
    "@xcite this is done for the case that @xmath45 ( i.e. , for orthogonal spin directions ) , and it was shown that the bound   is tight in this specific case .",
    "the authors further gave a tight relation for three orthogonal spin directions , as well as generalisations , both for pairs and triples of orthogonal spin observables , to higher dimensions , including the asymptotic behaviour , although these higher - dimensional results are not tight .",
    "the restriction to orthogonal spin observables , however , is a rather strong one .",
    "the general case for arbitrary pairs of qubit measurements was completely characterised in  @xcite using geometric methods , in particular the fact that @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the angle between @xmath48 and @xmath36 , etc .",
    "this method leads to the state - independent uncertainty relation only ) , and another version was given , for any fixed value of @xmath49 . with our equivalent version given in eq .",
    "below , it is straightforward to see that   also holds for mixed states . ] @xmath50 although the authors discuss some explicit instances of three - observable relations , their method does not readily lead to a generalised form of three - observable relations .    in this paper",
    "we present a different approach to deriving tight state - independent qubit uncertainty relations .",
    "this approach not only leads to a simpler derivation of the relation  , but is immediately generalisable to give relations for three or more arbitrary observables .",
    "it can also be used for other uncertainty measures beyond standard deviations , such as entropic measures .",
    "this offers a unified approach to completely characterising the possible state - independent uncertainty relations in two - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "we present here a general method to derive tight state - independent uncertainty relations for qubits . the approach is based on the fact that , in the case of a binary measurement @xmath1 , the expectation value @xmath51 contains all the information about the uncertainty in the measurement :",
    "for instance , both @xmath4 and @xmath31 can be expressed as simple functions of @xmath51 .",
    "we will thus start by giving relations characterising the set of allowed values @xmath52 , before translating these relations into ones in terms of standard deviations or entropies .",
    "a formal characterisation of the set of possible uncertainty values was given by kaniewski _",
    "et al . _  in ref .",
    "@xcite for the more general case of binary - valued measurements in arbitrary dimensional hilbert spaces .",
    "although the characterisation they give , which is formulated in terms of expectation values of anticommutators , leads to the results we present in this section ( specifically , lemmas  [ lemma : generalform][lemma_nobs ] below , albeit in a different mathematical framework ) , kaniewski _ et al . _",
    "use it to derive state-_dependent _ entropic uncertainty relations for this generalised scenario which bound the sum of the entropies considered , and are hence not tight in the sense we consider . in this paper",
    "our goal is instead to use this characterisation to derive general forms of tight , state - independent uncertainty relations for qubits .    for simplicity we will only consider below pauli measurements ( with eigenvalues @xmath33 ) , although , as we will discuss in section  [ sec : discussion ] , our results",
    "can straightforwardly be generalised to any projective measurements and even , with a little effort , to binary - valued positive - operator valued measures ( povms ) .",
    "we shall start with the case of two observables , before generalising to any number of measurements .",
    "let us first consider two arbitrary pauli observables @xmath34 and @xmath40 , and define the matrix @xmath53 with @xmath36 and @xmath54 as rows representing the measurement directions . in the bloch sphere representation we have @xmath55={\\mathbf{a}}\\cdot { \\mathbf{r}}$ ] and @xmath56={\\mathbf{b}}\\cdot { \\mathbf{r}}$ ] , so that @xmath57    although @xmath58 is not invertible , one can always find the moore - penrose pseudoinverse @xmath59 such that @xmath60 is an orthogonal projection onto the range of @xmath61 , that is , the subspace spanned by @xmath62  @xcite .",
    "this implies the following crucial lemma , which will be the basis of the uncertainty relations we derive in the following sections .",
    "[ lemma : generalform ] for any pair of pauli observables @xmath34 and @xmath40 with @xmath58 and @xmath63 as defined in eqs .   and  , and @xmath59 the pseudoinverse of @xmath58 ,",
    "every quantum state @xmath64 satisfies @xmath65 where equality is obtained if and only if @xmath48 lies in @xmath66 .    in a more explicit form ,",
    "this inequality implies the following relation for the two expectation values @xmath51 and @xmath67 :    [ lemma_2obs ] for any pair of pauli observables @xmath34 and @xmath40 , every quantum state @xmath64 satisfies @xmath68 in the case where @xmath69 , the first and second inequalities are saturated if and only if @xmath70 and if and only if @xmath6 is a pure state , respectively .",
    "let us choose a basis in the bloch sphere such that @xmath36 and @xmath54 can be written @xmath71 and @xmath72 , and assume first that @xmath69 .",
    "then @xmath58 has linearly independent rows and its pseudoinverse can be obtained using the relation @xmath73 .",
    "we thus have @xmath74 where we see that @xmath60 is a projection onto @xmath66 , as expected .",
    "the first inequality in eq .",
    "is then obtained by squaring eq .  , multiplying it by @xmath75 , and expanding ; like  , it is saturated when @xmath70 .",
    "the second inequality follows directly from @xmath76 , and is saturated when @xmath6 is a pure state .    in the ( trivial ) case",
    "where @xmath77 ( i.e. , @xmath78 ) , one can easily check that the left - hand side of eq .",
    "is @xmath79 so that the relation still holds .",

    "as can be seen , this ellipse becomes a circle for @xmath80 , and degenerates into the line segment given by @xmath82 when @xmath77 .",
    "note also that the first inequality in   characterises concentric ellipses for fixed maximal values of @xmath49 ( see figure  [ fig : avgrelns ] ) .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     figure  [ fig : entropicrelns ] shows the bound given by eq .   in the space of shannon entropies",
    "@xmath83 for @xmath84 and @xmath85 , in comparison to the weaker massen  uffink bound    with the maximum overlap given here by @xmath86  as well as the better , but still not tight , bound given in refs .  @xcite .",
    "one may wonder whether our approach can be generalised to give state - independent uncertainty relations for qutrits or higher - dimensional systems . as we will see , while it remains possible to obtain ( not necessarily tight ) relations on the expectation values of a set of observables , the peculiar geometry of the generalised bloch sphere for qutrits ( and beyond ) , as well as the increased number of eigenvalues of the observables , prevents us from expressing these relations in terms of standard deviations or entropies , as we could do for qubits .    in a @xmath87-dimensional hilbert space",
    "an arbitrary traceless observable @xmath1 can be expressed in terms of a set of @xmath88 traceless hermitian matrices @xmath89 , @xmath90 , which generate the group @xmath91 .",

    "the operators @xmath98 to @xmath99 are the gell - mann matrices , for example . as for the two - dimensional case , taking @xmath100 we can write any traceless observable @xmath1 as @xmath101 and thus represent it by its generalised bloch vector @xmath36 .",
    "an arbitrary state @xmath6 can similarly be written in terms of its generalised bloch vector @xmath48 as @xmath102 where now @xmath103 ( with equality for pure states ) . however , for @xmath104 it is _ not _ the case that _ any _ vector @xmath48 with @xmath105 represents a valid quantum state  @xcite : the set of valid quantum states ( i.e. , the bloch vector space ) is a strict subset of the unit sphere in @xmath87 dimensions .",
    "the expectation value of @xmath1 in the state @xmath6 can still be expressed as @xmath106 , so that lemma  [ lemma : generalform ] , with @xmath58 and @xmath63 defined as before , remains valid for higher - dimensional systems .",
    "this allows one to derive state - independent relations for the expectation values @xmath107 , as we did for qubits in section  [ sec : uncertainties ] .",
    "note that these relations may not be tight , as the vectors @xmath48 saturating   may not correspond to valid quantum states . for _ binary - valued _ measurements ,",
    "is state - dependent for @xmath108 , so it also fails to give the type of state - independent uncertainty relation we would like in this scenario . ]",
    "contrary to the case of qubits however , for @xmath109 one can not directly translate these relations to express them solely in terms of standard deviations or entropies ; indeed , because of the larger number of eigenvalues and of the geometry of the generalised bloch sphere , the expectation value @xmath51 does not contain all the information about the uncertainty of @xmath1 .",
    "for instance , the relation between @xmath110 , @xmath36 and @xmath48 is not simply given by eq .",
    "( where @xmath106 ) , but by @xmath111 where @xmath112 is a @xmath87-dimensional vector with components @xmath113  @xcite .",
    "thus , the uncertainty of @xmath1 for a state @xmath6 no longer depends only on the angle between the bloch vectors @xmath48 and @xmath36 .",
    "furthermore , in contrast to qubit operators , for three - or - more - level systems there are pairs of non - commuting observables that have a common eigenstate and hence can simultaneously have zero variance .",
    "in general , there is no simple analytical description of the bloch space for qudits  @xcite , so it seems implausible to give generalised forms of tight , state - independent uncertainty relations for such systems .    for certain choices of @xmath1 and @xmath2 a complete analysis of the set of obtainable values for @xmath4 and @xmath5 is nevertheless tractable ( at least for qutrits ) , and it is possible to give tight state - independent uncertainty relations .",
    "similarly , for well chosen @xmath1 and @xmath2 a more general higher - dimensional analysis is possible if one is prepared to settle for relations that are not tight . in ref .",
    "@xcite , for example , such behaviour is analysed for angular momentum observables in orthogonal directions . such an approach , however , lacks the generality of the approach possible for qubits , and is necessarily , at least in part ,",
    "by exploiting the relationship between the expectation values of pauli observables and standard measures of uncertainty ( such as the standard deviation ) , we have derived tight state - independent uncertainty relations for pauli measurements on qubits .",
    "these uncertainty relations completely characterise the allowed values of uncertainties for such observables . furthermore ,",
    "we give the bounds on all these relations in terms of the norm @xmath49 of the bloch vector representing the state @xmath114  which is directly linked to the purity of the state  so that , if a bound on this is known , tighter ( partially state - dependent ) uncertainty relations can be obtained ; for pure states @xmath38 and the most general form is recovered .",
    "the approach we take is general and , although we explicitly give tight uncertainty relations for arbitrary pairs and triples of pauli observables , it can be used to give tight uncertainty relations for sets of arbitrarily many observables .",
    "while we have focused on giving these uncertainty relations in terms of the standard deviations and variances of the observables , we showed how these can easily be rewritten in terms of shannon entropies to give tight entropic uncertainty relations , and did so explicitly for pairs of observables .",
    "these relations can furthermore be translated into uncertainty relations for any measure of uncertainty that depends only on the probability distribution , @xmath115 , of an observable @xmath116 for a state @xmath37 , such as rnyi entropies .",
    "indeed , one may reasonably argue that the product @xmath117 is the _ only _ parameter that an uncertainty measure for @xmath1 can depend on , and thus that our approach covers all kinds of preparation uncertainty relations for qubits .",
    "although we have given explicit uncertainty relations only for pauli observables , it is simple to extend them to arbitrary qubit measurements .",
    "to do so , note that one can write any observable @xmath1 in a two - dimensional hilbert space as @xmath118 , with @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "assuming @xmath121 ( as otherwise @xmath1 is simply proportional to the identity operator and one trivially has @xmath122 for all states @xmath6 ) , the observable @xmath123 with @xmath124 is a pauli observable , and we have @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "one can thus give an uncertainty relation involving @xmath1 by writing the corresponding relation that we derived for @xmath127 , and then replacing @xmath128 by @xmath129 and @xmath130 or @xmath131 by the appropriate expression given above ; one can proceed similarly for the other observables in question .",
    "finally we note that , although we have not done so here , it is also possible to go beyond projective measurements and give similar relations for positive - operator valued measures ( povms ) for qubits with binary outcomes .",
    "the two elements of any such povm can be written in the form @xmath132 $ ] , where @xmath133 .",
    "attaching , for simplicity , the output values @xmath33 to the two povm outcomes ( this can easily be generalised ) , we can then define an `` effective operator '' @xmath134 such that the expectation value of the povm outcomes can be simply written as @xmath135 . a similar construction to the one that led to lemma  [ lemma : generalform ]",
    "can thus be used , this time utilising the `` effective operators '' and defining @xmath136 .",
    "lemmas  [ lemma_2obs ] and  [ lemma_nobs ] then still hold , after suitably substituting @xmath51 for @xmath137 ( and similarly for the other observables in the relation ) . to translate these into standard deviations",

    "( for our choice of outcomes , @xmath33 ) @xmath139 , where @xmath4 here is ( in a slight abuse of notation ) the povm standard deviation , not that of the `` effective operator '' , which thus leads to state - independent uncertainty relations for povms .",
