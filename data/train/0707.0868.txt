    "the skyrme model @xcite is a nonlinear effective theory of mesons , specifically pions .",
    "its nonlinearity allows for the existence of topological soliton solutions , labelled by an integer - valued topological charge , @xmath0 .",
    "a quantized skyrmion of topological charge @xmath0 is interpreted as a nucleus with baryon number @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath1 skyrmion was first quantized by adkins , nappi and witten @xcite .",
    "they provided the first calibration of the skyrme model , by fitting the model to the proton and delta masses .",
    "the toroidal @xmath2 skyrmion was quantized in @xcite , and the energies corresponding to the ground state , representing the deuteron , and excited states were calculated .",
    "this analysis was extended in @xcite , to allow the two single skyrmions to separate in the most attractive channel .",
    "this led to a more accurate determination of the mean charge radius , as the deuteron is rather loosely bound .",
    "the interpretation of the nuclei helium-3 and hydrogen-3 ( triton ) as quantized states of the @xmath3 skyrmion was considered by carson @xcite , and the spins and energies were calculated .",
    "this analysis was extended in @xcite by a computation of the static electroweak properties of the quantized skyrmion .    in @xcite",
    ", the @xmath4 skyrmion was semiclassically quantized , and the ground state ( corresponding to the alpha particle ) and first excited state were determined , and their energies calculated . the results , though novel , involved consideration of selected vibrational modes as well as rigid body motion , and are difficult to generalize to higher baryon numbers . here",
    "we will consider the @xmath4 case from a different perspective , which may easily be generalized to higher baryon numbers , and enables us to compute the excitation energies of further excited states .",
    "further results on the allowed spin and isospin states of quantized skyrmions for @xmath0 up to 8 and beyond have been obtained by irwin @xcite , and taken further by krusch @xcite . however , in this work , there were no estimates of the energies of the states .",
    "it is not easy to assess the qualitative success of the skyrme model just from the results for @xmath5 .",
    "the nuclei have the correct spin and isospin quantum numbers , but on the whole the ground states represent nuclei which are too small and too tightly bound .",
    "nuclei with @xmath2 or @xmath3 have no excited states , experimentally , so skyrmion excited states based on rigid body quantization are not meaningful , and one expects them to break up into individual nucleons if further degrees of freedom are included .",
    "there have been a number of developments which make it worthwhile to reassess these results on quantized skyrmions , and it is also possible to extend them to the range of baryon numbers @xmath6 .",
    "first , it has been noted that a reparametrization of the skyrme model is desirable to achieve a better fit to nuclear sizes and related quantities like moments of inertia @xcite .",
    "the skyrme length scale should be roughly doubled , and consequently the dimensionless pion mass parameter also doubled ( to keep the physical pion mass fixed ) .",
    "doubling the pion mass parameter has little effect on the qualitative character of classical skyrmion solutions up to @xmath7 , but for @xmath8 there is a clear difference @xcite .",
    "the stable solutions are no longer the hollow polyhedra found earlier for @xmath0 up to 22 and beyond , but instead more dense structures closer to what one expects for nuclei .",
    "in particular , for @xmath0 a multiple of four , there are stable solutions which look like bound states of two or more of the cubically symmetric @xmath4 skyrmions @xcite .",
    "we shall analyse below the quantum states of the @xmath9 skyrmion , which is made up of two @xmath4 cubes , and compare with the states of nuclei with @xmath9 , including beryllium-8 .",
    "another development is a better understanding of the quantization rules for skyrmions , the so - called finkelstein - rubinstein ( fr ) constraints @xcite , which encode the requirement that a quantized @xmath1 skyrmion is a spin @xmath10 fermion .",
    "the fr constraints combine the symmetry of a skyrmion , for any value of @xmath0 , with the topology of the skyrme model , to constrain the spins and isospins of quantum states . here",
    "the rational map ansatz comes in @xcite .",
    "this gives a separation of variables between the angular and radial dependence of the skyrme field .",
    "true solutions do not exactly exhibit this separation , but they do so approximately .",
    "the ansatz gives a simple closed formula for the angular dependence of a skyrme field , and rotational symmetries are easier to find than if one just has a numerical skyrmion solution .",
    "the optimised rational map ansatz gives good approximations to true solutions up to @xmath7 ( and far beyond for zero or small pion mass ) .",
    "even if it is a poor approximation , it can still be helpful in the numerical search for true solutions , and more importantly here , it is helpful in determining the effect of the fr constraints .",
    "krusch has recently found a simple formula for determining the crucial signs that occur in the fr constraints @xcite .",
    "this formula requires knowledge of the rational map approximating the skyrmion .",
    "the rational map ansatz allows a further simplification , valid to the extent that a skyrmion is well approximated by the ansatz .",
    "kopeliovich noted that the moments of inertia ( both rotational and isorotational ) of a skyrme field described by the ansatz are rather simpler than for a general skyrme field @xcite , since the effect of a rotation is just to rotate the map , leaving the radial profile function invariant .",
    "we simplify kopeliovich s formulae further , taking advantage of the complex analytic character of a rational map , and obtain formulae for the 36 components of the spin / isospin inertia tensor",
    ". these can be accurately evaluated , and it is easy to recognize if certain components vanish because of symmetry . using these moments of inertia , we estimate anew the energies of ground and excited states of quantized skyrmions over the range of baryon numbers @xmath11 , and for the first time those in the range @xmath12 .",
    "the quantization is based on the established method of rigid - body quantization of rotations and isospin rotations .",
    "particularly interesting for us are the states of the @xmath13 skyrmion , since our reparametrization of the skyrme model @xcite was based on the mass and charge radius of the lithium-6 nucleus .",
    "also interesting are the states for @xmath9 , since the double cube @xmath9 skyrmion has not previously been quantized .",
    "a problem for the skyrme model that emerged in the work of irwin @xcite , is that the spin states of the @xmath14 and @xmath7 skyrmions disagree with those of the corresponding nuclei in their ground states .",
    "it has been suggested more than once ( see e.g. @xcite ) that it might be appropriate , for these baryon numbers , to quantize a deformed skyrmion with different symmetry .",
    "this would make sense , especially if the allowed spins were thereby reduced , making the spin energy smaller .",
    "the smaller spin energy might more than compensate the increased classical energy of the deformed skyrmion . in this paper",
    "we are able to quantitatively assess this idea .",
    "for @xmath7 it looks reasonable . a ground state with the correct spin @xmath15 for the lithium-7/beryllium-7 isodoublet",
    "can be obtained , and the previously found spin @xmath16 state interpreted as the observed , relatively low - lying second excited state .",
    "the spin @xmath17 first excited state is still problematic , however .",
    "for @xmath14 the situation is less satisfactory .    in the next section we review the skyrme model , and",
    "briefly describe the recent reparametrization of the skyrme model using the lithium-6 nucleus @xcite .",
    "although this is very important , we show that a reparametrization alone can not solve all the problems of the skyrme model . in section 3",
    "we describe the rational map ansatz for skyrmions .",
    "section 4 deals with the quantization of skyrmions , which proceeds by parametrizing time - dependent solutions through collective coordinates . here",
    ", we recall how the model is fermionically quantized by the imposition of fr constraints . in section 5",
    "we present expressions for the inertia tensors which appear in the formula for the kinetic energy operator , in terms of the approximating rational map .",
    "sections 6 to 13 deal with the energy levels of quantized skyrmions of baryon numbers 1 to 8 respectively . in section 14",
    "we provide a conclusion .",
    "the skyrme model is defined in terms of an @xmath18-valued scalar , the skyrme field @xcite .",
    "it is a low energy effective theory of qcd , becoming exact as the number of quark colours becomes large @xcite .",
    "we call the topological soliton solutions which it admits _ skyrmions_.    the lagrangian density is given by @xmath19[\\partial^\\mu u u^{-1 } , \\partial^\\nu u u^{-1 } ] + \\frac{1}{8 } m_\\pi ^2 f_\\pi ^2\\,\\hbox{tr}\\,(u-1_2 ) \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the skyrme field , @xmath21 is the pion decay constant , @xmath22 is a dimensionless parameter and @xmath23 is the pion mass .    using energy and length units of @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively",

    "field configurations of finite energy must satisfy the boundary condition @xmath30 as @xmath31 .",
    "this compactifies @xmath32 to a 3-sphere of infinite size , and so topologically @xmath33 at a fixed time .",
    "field configurations @xmath34 therefore lie in topological sectors labelled by their topological degree @xmath35 where @xmath36 the degree @xmath0 , which takes integer values , is identified with the baryon number .",

    "the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath21 can be fixed in a number of ways .",
    "it has been common practice to use the set of parameters given in @xcite with the physical pion mass taken into account , specifically @xmath42 in @xcite , the values of @xmath22 and @xmath21 were tuned to reproduce the masses of the proton and the delta resonance .",
    "this parameter set was adjusted to optimise the predictions of the model in the @xmath1 sector at the expense of the @xmath43 sector , which requires @xmath44 .",
    "it is not , therefore , the optimal parameter set globally .    in @xcite",
    ", we proposed that in order for the skyrme model to more closely model nuclear properties , a reparametrization would be desirable .",
    "we performed such a reparametrization by matching the model in the @xmath13 sector with properties of the lithium-6 nucleus , obtaining @xmath45    figure 1 shows graphs of nuclear masses and static skyrmion masses per unit baryon number , using this new parameter set .",
    "the skyrmion quantum energies are not included .",
    "we observe that the graphs intersect at @xmath13 , as expected .",
    "it is clear that it is not possible by a single parameter choice to correctly match nuclear and skyrmion masses for all baryon numbers and this remains the case when the quantum spin and isospin energies are included .",
    "we believe that calibrating the model in the @xmath13 sector is a promising way to describe the properties of nuclei with @xmath46 . for @xmath47",

    "we describe here the ansatz for skyrme fields which uses rational maps between riemann spheres to describe their angular behaviour @xcite .",

    "the additional quantum energy of the spin 2 , isospin 0 state is 2.9mev , which is a very good match to the experimental value of 3mev @xcite .",

    "if found , it could be a new ground state of the lithium-8 nucleus .",

    "it remains worthwhile to find the optimal values of @xmath305 and @xmath404 in the rational map ( [ eq : rmeight1 ] ) .",
    "ideally , the classical mass should not be very far away from the experimental mass of the beryllium-8 ground state which is 7455mev , and the moments of inertia should be comparable with the ones we get from the double cube approach . the second condition is more difficult to achieve since the rational map is defined on a sphere , and can not exactly reproduce a double cube configuration . looking through a range of possible @xmath305 and @xmath404 values we find that the optimal map is given approximately by @xmath405 leading to the following moments of inertia @xmath406 we have recalculated the energies of the states in table 1 , using the kinetic energy operator ( [ eq : firstt ] ) and formulae for the energy levels of an asymmetrical top @xcite .",

    "our current understanding is that the skyrme model provides a description of nuclear physics in which nucleons are partially merged , and their orientations in space and isospace are highly correlated . in a sense",
    ", this is the opposite of a naive shell model , in which nucleons move in a potential , and are to first approximation uncorrelated",
    ". a more realistic model would possibly lie somewhere between these two extremes . allowing the individual skyrmions , or subclusters of skyrmions , to move relative to each other , and performing a quantization of these degrees of freedom , would be a significant refinement to our approach . in so doing , some missing low - lying experimentally observed states of nuclei may appear .",

    "further investigation of the effect of varying the dimensionless pion mass parameter is also warranted .",
    "the length scale of the skyrmions is quite sensitive to this .",
