    "in addition to chaotic attractors , nonattracting chaotic sets ( also called chaotic saddles or chaotic repellors ) are also of great practical importance . in particular ,",
    "such sets arise in the consideration of chaotic scattering , boundaries between basins of attraction , and chaotic transients .",
    "if a cloud of initial conditions is sprinkled in a bounded region including a nonattracting chaotic set , the orbits originating at these points eventually leave the vicinity of the set , and there is a characteristic escape time , @xmath0 , such that , at late time , the fraction of the cloud still in the region decays exponentially at the rate @xmath1 .",
    "the primary focus of this paper will be on studying the fractal dimension of nonattracting chaotic sets and their stable and unstable manifolds .",
    "fractal dimension is of basic interest as a means of characterizing the geometric complexity of chaotic sets .",
    "in addition , a knowledge of the fractal dimension can , in some situations , provide quantitative information that is of potential practical use .",
    "for example , in the case of boundaries between different basins , the basin boundary is typically the stable manifold of a nonattracting chaotic set , and knowledge of the stable manifold s box - counting dimension ( also called its capacity ) quantifies the degree to which uncertainties in initial conditions result in errors in predicting the type of long - term motion that results ( e.g. , which attractor is approached ; see sec . 5 and ref .",
    "@xcite ) . our focus is on obtaining the information dimension of a suitable `` natural measure '' @xmath2 lying on the chaotic set ( see sec . 2 for definitions of the natural measures for nonattracting chaotic sets and their stable and unstable manifolds ) .",
    "the information dimension is a member of a one parameter ( @xmath3 ) class of dimension definitions given by @xmath4 where @xmath3 is a real index , @xmath5 is the grid spacing for a @xmath6-dimensional rectangular grid dividing the @xmath6-dimensional state space of the system , and @xmath7 is the natural measure of the @xmath8 grid cube .",
    "the box - counting dimension is given by ( [ dsubq ] ) with @xmath9 , and the information dimension is given by taking the limit @xmath10 in ( [ dsubq ] ) , @xmath11 in general , the information dimension is a lower bound on the box - counting dimension , @xmath12 . in practice , in cases where @xmath13 and @xmath14 have been determined for chaotic sets , it is often found that their values are very close .",
    "we are specifically concerned with investigating formulae conjectured in ref .",
    "@xcite that give the information dimensions for the nonattracting chaotic set and its stable and unstable manifolds in terms of lyapunov exponents and the decay time , @xmath0 .",
    "these formulae generalize previous results for nonattracting chaotic sets of two - dimensional maps with one positive and one negative lyapunov exponent @xcite , and for hamiltonian systems of arbitrary dimensionality @xcite . in turn , these past results for nonattracting chaotic sets were motivated by the kaplan - yorke conjecture which gives the information dimension of a chaotic attractor in terms of its lyapunov exponents @xcite .",
    "a rigorous result for the information dimension of an ergodic invariant chaotic set of a two - dimensional diffeomorphism has been given by l .- s .",
    "young @xcite , and this result supports the kaplan - yorke conjecture for attractors and the two - dimensional map results of refs . @xcite and @xcite for nonattracting chaotic sets .",
    "furthermore , ledrappier @xcite has proven that the conjectured kaplan - yorke dimension formula is an upper bound on the information dimension of chaotic attractors .",
    "soluble examples for typical systems and numerical experiments tend to support the kaplan - yorke result . on the other hand ,",
    "some specific examples violating the kaplan - yorke formula also exist .",
    "thus , in the kaplan - yorke conjecture they claim that their formula for the dimension applies for `` typical '' systems .",
    "that is , if a specific system violates the formula then by making a `` typical '' arbitrarily small change to the system we create a new system for which the kaplan - yorke formula holds ( this is discussed in refs . @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "specific systems violating the conjecture are called _ atypical _ , and , by ledrappier s result , have dimensions below the kaplan - yorke prediction . the conjectured results of ref .",
    "@xcite for nonattracting chaotic sets are also of this character in that they are also claimed to hold only for `` typical '' systems .",
    "thus , the issue of what constitutes a typical system ( or a typical perturbation of an atypical system ) is central . at present",
    "there is no rigorous formulation of `` typical '' for this purpose .",
    "for this reason it is important to address this question through examples .",
    "one of the purposes of this paper is to do just that . more generally ,",
    "although many examples , both analytical and numerical , exist which support the dimension formula for chaotic attractors , for the case of nonattracting chaotic sets there are virtually no supporting examples ( except for the case of two - dimensional maps with one positive and one negative lyapunov exponent @xcite ) .",
    "this paper provides such examples .",
    "in section 2 we review the results of ref .",
    "we define the _ natural transient measure _ on nonattracting chaotic sets and on their stable and unstable manifolds , and give the conjectured information dimension formulae for these measures .    in section 3",
    "we introduce a noninvertible two - dimensional map with two expanding ( positive ) lyapunov exponents .",
    "this map is simple enough that it can be fully analyzed .",
    "this analysis is especially useful in elucidating certain aspects of the general problem , particularly in relation to the natural transient measure and the role of fluctuation in the finite time lyapunov exponents .    in section 4",
    "we introduce our main example , a hard walled billiard chaotic scattering system in three spatial dimensions . for a particular symmetric configuration of the scatterer , we find ( secs . 5 and 6 ) that the situation is atypical ( i.e. , the conjectured formula does not apply ) , but that deviation of the configuration from the symmetric case immediately restores the validity of the conjectured dimension formula .",
    "section 5 presents numerical results for the dimension in the atypical ( symmetric ) and typical ( asymmetric ) cases obtaining good agreement with theoretical results in both cases .",
    "section 6 gives a theory for the structure of the nonattracting chaotic invariant set present in examples modeling our billiard scatterer .",
    "it is shown that the stable manifold of the invariant set is a continuous , nowhere - differentiable surface in both the typical and the atypical cases .",
    "furthermore , we are able to obtain an explicit formula for the dimension in the atypical case ( this formula is compared to numerical computations in sec . 5 ) .    in sec .",
    "7.1 we present a derivation of the dimension formulae of sec .",
    "2 . although these formulae have been previously derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , the previous derivation assumed a specific type of mapping .",
    "the situation envisioned in ref .",
    "@xcite does not apply to our billiard example .",
    "thus , we are motivated to provide more general arguments for the applicability of the formulae in sec .",
    "2 . in sec .",
    "7.2 we derive a formula for the dimension of the stable manifold of the chaotic repellor found in the typical ( asymmetric ) case .",
    "this derivation shows explicitly where the derivation of the typical formula fails for this nontrival atypical system .    in sec .",
    "8 we present conclusions and further discussion . in particular , we point out that the continuous , nowhere - differentiable surface forming the stable manifold of our billiard example may be amenable to experimental observation in a situation where the billiard walls are mirrors and the orbits are light rays . in general , we comment that we believe that such optical billiard experiments provide a particularly convenient arena for the experimental investigation of different types of fractal basin boundaries .",

    "7 we have provided arguments that are more general than those previously given @xcite for the dimension formulae of sec .",
    "2 .    to conclude , we now offer some discussion on the possible experimental realization of our billiard example .",
    "our point here is that such billiard systems offer a particularly nice way of experimentally realizing and studying basin boundaries . in the past",
    "there have been very few experiments that have attempted to study basin boundaries .",
    "the problem is the experimental difficulty of carrying out the technique used in numerical work : namely , choosing a grid of initial conditions and seeing where each orbit from each initial condition goes . to do this experimentally",
    ", one would have to precisely prepare an initial condition , run the experiment to see where the orbit with that initial condition goes , and do this for each initial condition .",
    "the difficulties with this approach are that it is often not possible to prepare initial conditions either on a fine enough grid or sufficiently precisely to observe small scale basin boundary structures and that running the experiment many times can be time consuming .",
    "( in addition , experimental parameters may drift over the course of the multiple experimental runs . ) nevertheless , in one case @xcite this program was successfully carried out . in that paper",
    "an electrical circuit was used as the experimental chaotic system , and the authors were able to experimentally demonstrate a riddled basin of attraction ( a type of basin for which final outcomes are particularly difficult to predict ; see refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) . in another work ,",
    "cusumano and kimble @xcite have devised a new experimental procedure for studying basin boundaries .",
    "this procedure has advantages over the straightforward method of preparing initial conditions on a grid . using this method , cusumano and kimble",
    "have successfully mapped out basin boundaries for experimental dissipative mechanical systems . to our knowledge , these two works ( and a billiard we discuss below ) are so far the only experimental investigations of fractal basin boundaries .",
    "this is in contrast to the large number of papers that have experimentally realized fractal structure in chaotic attractors .",
    "this disparity in the situations of attracting and nonattracting chaotic sets seems to be largely due to the disparity in the ease of experimental realization for the two cases .",
    "we believe that billiard systems offer a convenient avenue for experimental investigation of the various general types of basin boundaries .",
    "in particular , we suggest an optical realization of chaotic scattering billiards in which the billiard surface is made to be optically reflecting , and light rays play the role of orbits . for the scatterer of sec .",
    ", for example , imagine that we have a tube with cross section as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ellinbox](b ) and mirrored inner walls .",
    "the length of the tube is @xmath505 , where @xmath275 is the major radius of an ellipsoid with a mirrored surface .",
    "imagine that the tube is oriented vertically with its bottom , open end placed on a red surface , and that the ellipsoid is suspended in the tube . in this configuration ,",
    "an observer looking in the top of the tube sees multiple reflections of the red surface that is at the bottom of the tube . since rays whose",
    "directions are reversed retrace the same path , we can think of orbits from initial conditions starting on the retina of the observer s eye passing through his pupil , bouncing around in the scatterer , and then exiting either through the bottom ( red ) or the top ( not red ) .",
    "thus , the observed boundary of the red region is precisely the basin boundary that we have been discussing in secs .",
    "note that to observe that boundary we did not have to prepare many initial conditions and repeat the experiment many times .",
    "rather a single image giving a global picture of the basin can be formed ( replacing the observer s eye by a camera ) .",
    "we have already applied this approach to a chaotic scatterer formed from four mirrored spheres to experimentally study a different general type of basin boundary structure known as a wada boundary @xcite ( a wada boundary is a boundary separating three or more regions such that every boundary point is a boundary point for all regions ) . in the case of our ellipsoid billiard",

    "thus , we have that the information dimension of the stable manifold of the invariant set for the 3d map is @xmath558 where the superscribed circumflex denotes quantities calculated for the natural transient measure of the 3d map , ( [ phieqnagain ] ) and ( [ b3 ] ) . since the information dimension @xmath559 is a lower bound on the box - counting dimension for the map ( [ phieqnagain ] ) and ( [ b3 ] ) , and since the box - counting dimension of @xmath282 for the original 4d map is one plus that for the 3d map ( this follows from the structure shown in fig . [ fig : bb3d ] ) , we have that @xmath560 [ with @xmath559 given by ( [ b4 ] ) ] is a lower bound for the box - counting dimension of @xmath282 for the 4d map .",
    "we emphasize , however , that @xmath560 is different from @xmath341 for the 4d system .",
    "this is because of the difference in the natural transient measures for the 3d and 4d maps .",
    "( in contrast , the box - counting dimensions do not depend on the measures . ) in particular , as shown below , as compared to the 4d map natural transient measure , the natural transient measure for the 3d map more strongly weights @xmath313 values which experience slower repulsion from the invariant set @xmath15 .",
    "to see this we consider the lyapunov exponent corresponding to the evolution of a differential perturbation in @xmath394 which we denote @xmath561",
    ". differentiating ( [ b3 ] ) we have @xmath562 where @xmath563 the determinant of ( [ b1 ] ) , ( [ b2 ] ) , @xmath564 . noting that @xmath565 and comparing ( [ b5 ] ) with ( [ b2 ] ) , we have @xmath566 for points on @xmath282 , @xmath398 decreases exponentially with time ( i.e.",
    ", it approaches the invariant set @xmath15 ) .",
    "hence , @xmath567,\\ ] ] where @xmath568 and @xmath569 with @xmath570 is the expanding @xmath308 , finite - time lyapunov exponent for the 4d system .",
    "the estimate , @xmath571 , in ( [ b7 ] ) follows since , due to the hamiltonian nature of the problem , @xmath572 as @xmath246 .",
    "thus , for a given value of @xmath313 , in the 3d system , the expansion away from the invariant set is at the rate @xmath573 rather than at the rate @xmath569 , applying to the 4d system .",
    "for the example of ( [ analzmap ] ) there are no finite time lyapunov exponent fluctuations [ @xmath574 independent of @xmath26 and @xmath313 ] , so that the 3d and 4d natural transient measures are the same , both are uniform in @xmath313 .    in this case , @xmath576 more generally , the finite time exponents , @xmath569 , fluctuate as @xmath313 varies .",
    "the faster expansion rate away from @xmath15 ( namely @xmath577 ) in the 3d case means that @xmath313 values with slower expansion rates are more strongly weighted .",
    "thus , for a case such as our ellipsoid problem we expect that @xmath578 where @xmath579 is the infinite time lyapuonv exponent for the 3d map measure and for perturbations in @xmath394 .",
