    "the research on dirac materials  @xcite encompasses many areas of physics , ranging from a fundamental theory with ties to particle physics , to concrete sought - after technological applications in materials science . from a theoretical point of view , interacting dirac systems are particularly appealing as a playground for development of novel and applications of known quantum - field - theoretical tools , providing an opportunity for their testing against numerical and experimental results .",
    "graphene@xcite , in particular , at charge - neutrality serves as a prime example of a class of materials where dirac nature of the low - energy excitations emerges naturally from the underlying honeycomb lattice structure , and is further protected by its symmetries .",
    "the presence of sufficiently strong interactions can lead to spontaneous symmetry breaking signaled by the appearance of an ordered ground state .",
    "there is a wide variety of possible ordering patterns determined by small variations of the short - ranged interaction parameters , which have been analyzed by different theoretical approaches , ranging from mean - field calculations to the renormalization group and numerical simulations@xcite .",
    "a large repulsive onsite interaction @xmath3 , for example , exhibits a continuous quantum phase transition from the semimetallic ( sm ) phase into an antiferromagnetic spin - density - wave ( sdw ) state , whereas a nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath4 would induce a conventional charge - density wave ( cdw ) state .",
    "while there is an ongoing debate on whether a pure second - nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath5 can induce a topological mott insulating state@xcite or whether it favors a sublattice charge - modulated state@xcite , it is believed that the interplay between balanced @xmath4 and @xmath5 gives rise to yet another ordered ground state  the kekul valence bond solid ( vbs )  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , this ordering can also emerge from electron - phonon interactions@xcite .",
    "the translation symmetry breaking kekul vbs corresponds to a particular dimerization pattern of the fermions on the honeycomb lattice with a bond - dependent nearest - neighbor hopping amplitude ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : kekule ] ) , and has recently been accessed even experimentally  @xcite .    .,title=\"fig : \" ] .,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "the kekul ordering pattern can be described by a @xmath1 symmetric order parameter that describes breaking of the lattice translational symmetry and the @xmath6 rotational symmetry@xcite .",
    "due to @xmath1 symmetry the cubic terms in the order parameter in the landau - ginzburg ( lg ) free energy are allowed , which generically prevent a phase transition toward the ordered state from being continuous@xcite .",
    "the lg free energy @xmath7 takes the form @xmath8=f_0+r\\ , |\\phi|^2 + g ( \\phi^3+\\phi^{\\ast 3})+\\lambda |\\phi|^4\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 represents the complex - valued order parameter of the vbs , @xmath7 is symmetric under the field transformation @xmath10 and the parameter @xmath11 is used to tune through the phase transition by crossing a critical value  @xmath12 . in the case when the cubic coupling @xmath13 vanishes , the lg theory suggests that the phase transition is of second order , since at @xmath14 a non - vanishing minimum of the lg free energy emerges continuously from the origin at @xmath15 . for a finite  @xmath13 , on the other hand ,",
    "the minimum of @xmath7 jumps discontinuously from @xmath15 to a @xmath16 as @xmath11 goes through its critical value  @xmath17 , i.e. a first - order transition is expected ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : kekule ] ) .",
    "this simple consideration is not sufficient , however , to describe the kekul phase transition when massless fermions are present and coupled to the @xmath1 order parameter .",
    "we study the quantum phase transition of massless dirac fermions toward the kekul vbs within the appropriate gross - neveu - yukawa theory , and in @xmath18 dimensions .",
    "we find that the presence of ( neutral ) dirac fermions tends to reduce the first - order character of the phase transition@xcite , and that closer to @xmath19 dimensions the phase transition may even be rendered continuous@xcite .",
    "however , the values of parameter @xmath2 where this happens are not small , and this possibility seems beyond the realm of control of the @xmath2 expansion .",
    "sizable corrections which may even overturn the conclusion based on the lowest order calculation can generally be expected beyond the one - loop order . adding a @xmath0 gauge field that would couple exclusively to fermions , as the kekul order parameter is electrically neutral , on the other hand",
    ", significantly further reduces the discontinuous nature of the transition , and we find that in its presence the transition may become continuous even at small values of @xmath2 .",
    "the resulting quantum critical behavior in this case is discussed in some detail .",
    "we also present an argument that in the limit of a large number of fermion species the phase transition becomes continuous only for @xmath20 , even if higher - loop terms are included .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "\\(2 ) the charge coupling features a non - trivial fixed point value , when the gauge field propagates in the same @xmath227 dimensions as the matter fields . here , the presence of a finite charge fixed - point coupling also strongly supports the emerging irrelevance of the cubic term at smaller values of @xmath2 . for a small number of fermion flavors , the boundary where the coupling is rendered irrelevant moves close to four dimensions , however , at the cost of the prefactors of the @xmath229 fixed point values growing large .",
    "furthermore , we have carefully discussed the limit of a large number of dirac fermion flavors in the case of vanishing charge , as well as for finite charge in the scenario  ( 2 ) . in this limit",

    "finally , for vanishing charge we have shown that this statement also holds at two - loop order , and provided an argument that suggests that this conclusion continues to hold at arbitrary order in the loop expansion ."
