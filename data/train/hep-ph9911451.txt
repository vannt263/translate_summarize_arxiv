    "november 21 , 1999 + to be published in heavy ion physics    effective chiral theories have become a major conceptual and analytical tool in particle physics driven by the need of a theory to describe the low  energy phenomenology of qcd .",
    "the foundations were formulated originally by weinberg @xcite to characterise the most general s - matrix elements for soft pion interactions and later it was further developed by gasser and leutwyler @xcite .",
    "effective chiral theories have shown to be an adequate framework to treat low ",
    "energy phenomenology @xcite-@xcite , as they reproduce , at lowest order in the chiral expansion , the most important results from current algebras including the low  energy theorems , and at next - to - leading order , they give precise corrections to these results @xcite . they have been widely applied to different problems as meson  meson , meson  baryon , photon ",
    "photon , photon  meson and photon  baryon scattering , photoproduction processes and rare kaon decays @xcite .",
    "the propagation properties of relativistic particles in plasmas at finite temperature is also a subject of increasing interest .",
    "it is well known that the interaction of a particle with a plasma in thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath2 modifies the dispersion relations ( dr ) with respect to the zero temperature situation .",
    "this phenomenon has been extensively investigated for the non - dense plasma case @xcite-@xcite , i.e. when the chemical potential @xmath1 associated to the fermions of the thermal plasma is equal to zero : @xmath5 and @xmath6 . in this case",
    "the fermionic dispersion relations ( fdr ) have been studied for massless fermions in @xcite-@xcite and massive fermions in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the fdr describe the propagation of the fermionic excitations of the plasma ( quasi - fermions and quasi - holes ) through the thermal background .",
    "these excitations are originated in the collective behaviour of the plasma system at low momentum .",
    "on the other hand , dr describing the propagation of the fermionic excitations of a dense plasma at finite temperature can be found in literature @xcite-@xcite .",
    "for the dense plasma case at finite temperature , i.e. @xmath7 and @xmath6 , the fdr have been calculated both for massless fermions in @xcite-@xcite and for massive fermions in @xcite .",
    "these fdr have been calculated in the context of realistic physical models , as for instance , the minimal standard model @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we calculate the dr for quasi  nucleons and quasi  pions propagating in a plasma at finite temperature and",
    "non  vanishing chemical potentials .",
    "the calculation is performed for a @xmath8 effective chiral lagrangian with the chiral symmetry broken into @xmath9 .",
    "this lagrangian , which we introduce in section 2 , describe the strong and electromagnetic interactions of massive nucleons and massless pions .",
    "the calculation is performed using the real time formalism of the thermal field theory @xcite-@xcite in the feynman gauge .",
    "the one  loop dr are calculated at lowest order in the energy expansion and obtained taking the @xmath10 and @xmath11 terms from the self  energy , as shown in section 3 . as an application of the dr obtained , we evaluate the effective masses of the quasi  nucleon and quasi  pion excitations taking the following values : @xmath12150 mev , @xmath13=100 mev and @xmath14 , being @xmath15 the chemical potential for protons ( neutrons ) @xcite .",
    "this evaluation is shown in section 4 , as well as the discussion of the main results and conclusions .",
    "effective chiral theories are founded in the existence of an energy scale @xmath16 at which chiral symmetry @xmath17 , with @xmath18 the number of flavours , breaks into @xmath19 leading to @xmath20 goldstone bosons associated to the @xmath18 broken generators .",
    "these goldstone bosons are identified with the meson ground state octet for @xmath21 , and with the triplet of pions @xcite in the case of @xmath22 .",
    "the chiral symmetry of the lagrangian is broken through the introduction of an explicit mass term for the nucleons .",
    "a general form for a lagrangian with @xmath9 symmetry describing the strong and electromagnetic interactions for massive nucleons and massless pions is @xcite : @xmath23 + { \\cal l}_{\\pi n}-\\frac{1}{4 } f_{\\mu \\nu } f^{\\mu \\nu } , \\label{lag}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 with @xmath25 where the covariant derivative and electromagnetic charge are defined as @xmath26 , \\\\ q & = & \\left (   \\begin{array}{cc } \\frac{2}{3 } & 0 \\\\   0 & \\frac{-1}{3 } \\end{array } \\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 represent the pion , nucleon and electromagnetic fields , @xmath30=93 mev is the pion decay constant , @xmath31 is the electromagnetic coupling constant , @xmath32 is the axial coupling constant , and @xmath33 is the average nucleon mass .    in this section",
    "we calculate the dr for nucleons and pions in the framework of the lagrangian given by ( [ lag ] ) .",
    "we consider the propagation of the nucleonic and pionic excitations in a dense thermal plasma constituted by protons , neutrons , charged pions , neutral pions and photons , being this plasma characterised by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 represents the different fermion species .",
    "the calculation is performed in the real time formalism of the thermal field theory in the feynman gauge .",
    "the real part of the nucleonic and pionic self - energies are evaluated at lowest order in the energy expansion and at one - loop order @xmath36 , considering only the leading contributions in @xmath2 and @xmath37 .",
    "the feynman rules for the vertices at finite temperature and density ( fig",

    "this temperature is of the order of 200 mev as it is indicated by lattice calculations @xcite .      using the feynman diagrams given in fig .",
    "( 2 ) , we calculate the fdr for quasi  protons and quasi",
    " neutrons .    in order to apply a similar procedure to",
    "that followed in @xcite , we first consider the hypothetical case of massless nucleons . in this case , we obtain two solutions : one describing the propagation of quasi - fermions @xmath57 and another one describing the propagation of quasi - holes @xmath58 we observe that if @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
    "then @xmath61 can be interpreted as the effective mass of the quasi - protons ( quasi - neutrons ) , and their expressions are : @xmath62 and @xmath63 for the limit @xmath64 the fdr are : @xmath65 for very high momentum the relations @xmath66 and @xmath67 become the ordinary dr for a massless fermion propagating in the vacuum , i.e. @xmath68 .",

    "this result shows that the chemical potential is associated with the difference between the number of nucleons over anti",
    " nucleons .",
    "the later means that if a dense thermal plasma is characterised by @xmath70 , then the plasma presents an excess of nucleons over anti - nucleons .",
    "now we consider the more realistic case where nucleons are massive . in this case",
    "the fdr are valid for @xmath71 , where @xmath72 mev is the critical temperature of the chiral phase transition in non ",
    "zero hadronic density @xcite .",
    "we observe that @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the rest mass of the proton ( neutron ) and @xmath75 are given by ( [ mp ] ) and ( [ mn ] ) . in the limit @xmath76 the fdr become @xcite : @xmath77    starting from relation ( [ wpn ] ) and equations ( [ mp ] ) , ( [ mn ] )",
    ", we obtain a general expression for the nucleon effective mass splitting @xmath78 : @xmath79      using the feynman rules given in fig .",
    "( 1 ) , we obtain the following dr for quasi - pions : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the effective mass for charged ( neutral ) quasi  pions , and their expressions are : @xmath82 and @xmath83    from ( [ mpicar ] ) and ( [ mpineu ] ) we obtain the pion effective mass splitting @xmath84 : @xmath85",
    "we now give the results of the calculation for the effective masses of quasi  nucleons and quasi  pions .",
    "we have used the following values @xmath86938.271 mev , @xmath87939.566 mev , @xmath88938.919 mev , @xmath12150 mev , @xmath89100 mev , @xmath90200 mev , @xmath910.095 .",

    "temperature effects enter into the effective mass splitting relations ( [ deltam ] ) and ( [ msp ] ) exclusively in the electromagnetic interaction term , which at @xmath120 vanishes . also , in the framework of our model we found that , for the chemical potentials and temperature used , the effective mass on the proton is bigger than the one of the neutron .",
