    "the discovery of the iron pnictides superconductors @xcite has provided a new direction in the studies of high-@xmath5 superconductors . similar to the high-@xmath5 cuprates superconductors , introducing charge carriers ( electrons or holes ) into the parent antiferromagnetic material causes superconductivity .",
    "thus , comparison of the phase diagram of the iron pnictides with that of the high-@xmath5 cuprates is necessary for understanding the mechanism of the superconductivity in the pnictides and the cuprates . in the hole - doped system ba@xmath6k@xmath7fe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( ba122 ) , when the feas plane has as many holes as @xmath8 0.2 per fe atom , @xmath5 does not disappear , different from the high-@xmath5 cuprate .",
    "the end member of the ba122 system kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 , which has 0.5 hole per fe site , shows @xmath1 4 k @xcite .",
    "interestingly , @xmath9as nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) and specific heat studies of kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 have suggested the existence of multiple nodal superconducting gaps rather than a full gap .",
    "also , the electronic specific heat coefficient @xmath10 is as large as @xmath1170 mj / k@xmath12mol @xcite , indicating electron mass renormalization by electron correlation . in order to study the relationship between the electron correlation strength and superconductivity ,",
    "it has been desired to reveal electron energy band dispersions and fermi surfaces ( fss ) in kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 . a previous angle - resolved photoemission study ( arpes )",
    "has revealed that there are hole fermi surfaces ( @xmath3 and @xmath13 ) around the zone center while the electron pockets around the zone corner disappear and change to small hole pockets ( @xmath14 ) due to the heavy hole doping @xcite .",
    "however , three hole fermi surfaces around the zone center predicted by the band - structure calculation has not been resolved .",
    "recently , a de haas - van alphen ( dhva ) study has revealed that the @xmath4 sheet which has a similar size to the @xmath3 sheet exists around the zone center @xcite . furthermore , the dhva study has pointed out the shrinkage of the @xmath3 and @xmath4 sheets and the enhancement of electron mass compared to those predicted by the band - structure calculation . in the present study , in order to reveal the shapes of the fss more precisely in the three - dimensional momentum space , we have performed an arpes study of kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 using high - quality single crystals and various photon energies .",
    "as@xmath0 obtained by arpes .",
    "( a ) spectral weight at @xmath15 in the @xmath16-@xmath17 plane .",
    "fermi momenta @xmath18 ( filled circles ) were obtained by peak positions of the momentum distribution curves .",
    "( b ) comparison of the fss obtained by arpes ( filled circles ) with those predicted by band - structure calculation .",
    "results of band - structure calculation are shown by thick solid lines ( @xmath2= 0 ) and thick dotted lines ( @xmath2= @xmath19 corresponding to the z point).,width=283 ]",
    "arpes measurements were performed at beamline 5 - 4 of stanford synchrotron radiation laboratory ( ssrl ) with a normal incidence monochromator and a scienta ses - r4000 electron analyzer .",
    "the typical energy and angular resolutions used for the present measurements were about 10 mev and 0.3 degree , respectively .",
    "single crystals of kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 were grown from k flux .",
    "samples were cleaved _ in situ _ and measured at a temperature of 15 k in a pressure better than @xmath20 torr .",
    "we have performed the measurements at photon energies from @xmath21=14 to 33 ev .",
    "the in - plane ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) and out - of - plane ( @xmath2 ) momentum are expressed in units of @xmath22 and @xmath19 , respectively , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the electronic band structure of kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 was calculated within the local density approximation ( lda ) by using the full potential lapw ( flapw ) method .",
    "we used the program codes tspace @xcite and kansai-06 .",
    "the experimental crystal structure @xcite including the atomic position @xmath25 of as was used for the calculation .",
    "band dispersions taken with @xmath21=25 ev are shown in fig . [ ek](a ) .",
    "the cut is along the diagonal of the two - dimensional brillouin zone and the image has been obtained by the second derivative of the energy distribution curves .",
    "all the energy bands giving rise to the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 fs sheets predicted by the calculation [ fig.[ek](b ) ] are observed .",
    "particularly , we have clearly observed the @xmath4 band close to the @xmath3 band near @xmath15 , consistent with the dhva result @xcite .",
    "in addition to these bands , we find that another hole - like band exists near the zone center .",
    "since this is not predicted by the bulk band - structure calculation , this band may be due to surface states . by comparing the arpes band dispersions with the band - structure calculation shown in fig.[ek ] ( b ) , the enhancement of electron mass of the @xmath3 band is found to be @xmath26 3 . on the other hand ,",
    "the dispersion of the @xmath4 band strongly deviates from the band - structure calculation , indicating orbital dependent mass renormalization .",
    "figure [ fs2d ] ( a ) shows fermi surfaces in the @xmath16-@xmath17 plane of kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 obtained by arpes .",
    "the overall fermi surface shapes are nearly consistent with those observed in the previous study @xcite . however , several new observations should be remarked .",
    "one is the observation of the @xmath4 sheet which has a similar size as the @xmath3 sheet as already pointed out above .",
    "fermi momenta @xmath18 s obtained by the mdc peak positions show different values between the @xmath16 and the @xmath17 direction .",
    "this can be explained by existence of the two fermi surfaces ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) with different matrix element effects . according to the dhva result @xcite",
    ", the larger hole fermi surface is ascribed to the @xmath4 fermi surface .",
    "another point is that a small fermi surface around the zone center has been observed .",
    "since this fs is not predicted by the band - structure calculation and has nearly two - dimensional dispersions as indicated below , it can be ascribed to surface states .        here",
    ", we compare the fss obtained by arpes with those predicted by the band - structure calculation in fig.[fs2d ] ( b ) .",
    "the fermi surface areas are estimated to be 10.1 , 11.8 , 28.5 and 2.1 % of the brillouin zone for @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , respectively , in good agreement with the results of dhva @xcite .",
    "note that the @xmath3 and @xmath4 fermi surfaces are smaller than those in the band - structure calculation , while the @xmath13 and @xmath14 fss are larger .",
    "this trend may be explained by a theoretical prediction based on inter - band interaction @xcite .    since the ba122 system has three dimensional fss which are predicted by band - structure calculations @xcite and confirmed by arpes @xcite , we have investigated the electronic band dispersions in the @xmath2 direction by changing the excitation photon energy .",
    "figuer [ fs3d](c ) shows spectral weight mapping at @xmath15 in the @xmath16-@xmath2 plane .",
    "@xmath2 has been is determined by assuming an inner potential @xmath27=13ev .",
    "arpes spectra near the zone center taken at @xmath21= 20 ev and 30 ev , corresponding to the cuts in fig .",
    "[ fs3d](c ) , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fs3d ] ( a ) and fig .",
    "[ fs3d](b ) , respectively . from fig .",
    "[ fs3d](c ) , one can see that the observed fermi surfaces are nearly two - dimensional , consistent with the band - structure calculation .",
    "note that the fs of the surface state near the zone center has also two - dimensional character . from figs .",
    "[ fs3d](a ) and [ fs3d](b ) , one can see that the structure @xmath11 0.2 ev below @xmath15 observed for h@xmath28=20 ev moves towards @xmath15 for h@xmath28=30 ev , indicating that the this band is dispersive along the @xmath2 direction .",
    "in fact , normal emission spectra [ fig.[fs3d ] ( d ) ] clearly illustrate a parabolic dispersion along the @xmath2 direction and slightly crosses @xmath15 in the vicinity of the @xmath29 point . from the band - structure calculation ,",
    "this band can be identified as the @xmath30 band . with a mass enhancement factor",
    "@xmath26 3 , this band is also well explained by the band - structure calculation .",
    "in summary , we have observed fss in kfe@xmath0as@xmath0 in three - dimensional momentum space by using arpes .",
    "all fss except for the surface states are qualitatively consistent with the band - structure calculation .",
    "the sizes of the fss are quantitatively consistent with the dhva observation : the @xmath3 and @xmath4 sheets are smaller than those in the band - structure calculation while the @xmath13 and @xmath14 sheets are larger , which may be attributed to electron correlation effects .",
