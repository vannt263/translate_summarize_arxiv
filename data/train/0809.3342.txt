    "one of the initial motivations for pursuing solar neutrino physics was to test our understanding of main - sequence stellar evolution and the standard solar model ( ssm ) . in the past two decades",
    "this goal was put aside , as difficulties in understanding the pattern of solar neutrino fluxes led to the discovery of solar neutrino oscillations .",
    "but because of the precision with which the relevant flavor physics is now known  and because the solar neutrino problem also spurred progress in the nuclear physics of the sun and the development of high - statistics detectors such as super - kamiokande ( sk ) and sno  the use of neutrinos as quantitative solar probe is now a practical possibility .",
    "specifically , this talk summarizes recent arguments by aldo serenelli and me @xcite that a measurement of the cn neutrino flux could test a key assumption of the ssm , the homogeneity of the zero - age main sequence sun .",
    "this assumption , the basis for equating the ssm s primordial core metal abundances to today s surface metal abundances , may now be in some degree of conflict with observation : recent 3d modeling of photospheric absorption lines has led to a downward revision in the metal content of the solar convective zone @xcite , altering helioseismology in the upper radiative zone , where the temperature @xmath0 2 - 5 @xmath1 10@xmath2 k @xcite . in this region c , n , o , ne , and ar are partially ionized and particularly o and ne have a significant influence on the radiative opacity .",
    "a quantitative comparison between the sun s surface and core abundances could prove useful in understanding the chemical evolution of other gaseous bodies in our solar system , whose interiors are not as readily probed .",
    "the galileo and cassini missions found significant metal enrichments in the h / he atmospheres of jupiter and saturn , e.g. , abundances of c and n of @xmath0 four times solar for jupiter and @xmath0 4 - 8 for saturn @xcite . planetary models that take account of these data show that the gaseous giants are very significant solar - system metal reservoirs .",
    "the metal excess in these planets , estimated to be @xmath3 , is very similar to the depletion that would be needed in the convection zone to bring the photospheric abundances and helioseismology into agreement .",
    "serenelli and i raised the possibility that a two - zone sun resulted from a process in which the last @xmath0 1% of nebular gas was scoured of its metals by the process of planetary formation , then deposited on the early sun to dilute the convective zone .",
    "the need for two mechanisms to burn hydrogen was recognized in the pioneering work of bethe and collaborators .",
    "the first , the pp - chain , dominates energy production in our sun and other low - mass main - sequence stars and can be considered a primary process in which the chain s  catalysts , \" deuterium , @xmath4he , and @xmath5be/@xmath5li ( the elements participating in the steps leading to @xmath6he ) , are synthesized as the chain burns to equilibrium .",
    "but the sharper temperature dependence of a second mechanism , the cno bi - cycle , is needed to account for the structure of more massive main - sequence stars . unlike the pp - chain , the cno bi - cycle ( fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] ) is a secondary process : the catalysts for h burning are the pre - existing metals .",
    "thus the cno contribution to energy generation is proportional to stellar metalicity .",
    "the cn - cycle , denoted by i in fig .",
    "[ fig : two ] , operates in the sun .",
    "the cycle conserves the number abundance , but alters the distribution of metals as it burns into equilibrium , eventually achieving equilibrium abundances proportional to the inverses of the respective rates .    ,",
    "measured in units of 10@xmath5 k. the results are normalized to the pp - chain energy production at the sun s center and to solar metalicity , assuming equilibrium burning .",
    "the sharper cn - cycle dependence on temperature is apparent . if approximated as a power law t@xmath7 , @xmath8 ranges between @xmath0 19 and @xmath0 22 over the range of temperatures typical of the sun s hydrogen - burning core .",
    "the dot marks the point corresponding to the sun s center , t@xmath9 1.57.,width=604 ]    while responsible for only @xmath0 1% of solar energy generation , the cn cycle produces measurable neutrino fluxes .",
    "the slowest , rate - controlling reactions in the cn cycle are @xmath10n(p,@xmath11 ) and @xmath12c(p,@xmath11 ) .",
    "the latter has reached equilibrium over most of the solar core .",
    "in fact , the rapid burning of @xmath12c , as the cycle seeks equilibrium at the start of the main sequence , likely drives convective mixing of the early solar core for @xmath13 y. in contrast , the @xmath10n lifetime is shorter than the age of the sun only in regions where @xmath14 , which corresponds to @xmath15 in today s sun , or equivalently the central 7% of the sun by mass . consequently , over a significant portion of the outer core , @xmath12c has been converted to @xmath10n , but further reactions are inhibited by the @xmath10n(p,@xmath11 ) bottleneck .",
    "the bsp08(gs ) ssm @xcite  which employs recent updates of metal abundances and of the @xmath10n(p,@xmath11 ) s - factor  finds a modest cn - cycle contribution to solar energy generation of 0.8% and corresponding neutrino fluxes @xmath16 @xmath17 the ranges reflect conservative abundance uncertainties as defined empirically in @xcite .",
    "the first reaction is part of the path from @xmath12c to @xmath10n , while the latter follows @xmath10n(p,@xmath11 ) .",
    "thus neutrinos from @xmath18o @xmath19 decay are produced in the central core : 95% of the flux comes from the cn - equilibrium region , described above .",
    "about 30% of the @xmath20n neutrinos come from outside this region , primarily because of the continued burning of primordial @xmath12c : this accounts for the somewhat higher flux of these neutrinos .",
    "the ssm makes several reasonable assumptions , including local hydrostatic equilibrium ( the balancing of the gravitational force against the gas pressure gradient ) , energy generation by proton burning , a homogeneous zero - age sun , and boundary conditions imposed by the known mass , radius , and luminosity of the present sun .",
    "it assumes no significant mass loss or accretion .",
    "the homogeneity assumption allows the primordial core metalicity to be fixed to today s surface abundances .",
    "corrections for the effects of diffusion of he and the heavy elements over 4.57 b.y . of solar evolution are included , and generally been helpful in improving the agreement between ssm predictions and parameters probed in helioseismology .",
    "the ssm postulate of a homogeneous zero - age sun is based on the assumptions 1 ) that the early pre - main - sequence sun passed through a fully convective , highly luminous hayashi phase , mixing the sun ; and 2 ) that no chemical differentiation in the gas accreted onto the sun occurred after this phase , when the sun develops a radiative core distinct from the convective surface zone .",
    "solar surface abundances are known , determined from analyses of photospheric atomic and molecular spectral lines .",
    "traditionally the associated atmospheric modeling has been done in one dimension , in a time - independent hydrostatic analysis that incorporates convection via mixing - length theory . but much improved 3d models of the solar atmosphere have been developed recently to treat the radiation - hydrodynamics and time dependence of this problem .",
    "this 3d analysis led to a revision in solar metalicity from the previous standard , z=0.0169 @xcite , to z=0.0122 @xcite , thus altering ssm predictions .",
    "hereafter we denote these as the gs and and ags abundances , respectively .    the predictions of solar models that use the gs solar composition , the most up to date of which is the bps08(gs ) @xcite but including also the bp00 @xcite , bp04 @xcite and bs05(op ) @xcite models , are in excellent agreement with helioseismology . but those computed with the revised abundances are in much poorer agreement , with discrepancies exceeding 1% in the region just below the convective zone ( r @xmath21 ) . associated properties of the ssm , such as the depth of the convective zone and the surface he abundance , are also now in conflict with helioseismology .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the discrepancies are significantly above measurement and solar model uncertainties .",
    "the reduced core opacity also lowers the ssm prediction of the temperature - dependent @xmath22b neutrino flux by about 20% : the predicted @xmath22b flux using the gs abundances and opacity project @xcite opacities ( model bps08(gs ) ) is 5.95 @xmath1 10@xmath2/@xmath23s , which drops to 4.72 @xmath1 10@xmath2/@xmath23s when ags abundances are used ( model bps08(ags ) ) .",
    "these results can be compared to the @xmath22b neutrino flux deduced from the ncd - phase sno data set of [ 5.54 @xmath24 ( stat ) @xmath25 ( sys ) ] @xmath1 10@xmath2/@xmath23s @xcite .",
    "it has been recognized for many years that a measurement of the cn - cycle solar neutrino flux would , in principle , determine the metalicity of this core zone , allowing a comparison with abundance determined from the solar atmosphere . in the past",
    "several years new developments have occurred that may make such a measurement practical :    * accurate calibrations of the solar core temperature by sno and sk ; * tight constraints on the oscillation parameters and matter effects that determine the flavor content of the cn and @xmath22b neutrino fluxes ; * recent measurements of the controlling reaction of the cn cycle , @xmath10n(p,@xmath11 ) , that have significantly reduced the nuclear physics uncertainties affecting ssm predictions of cn - cycle fluxes ; and * new ideas for high - counting rate experiments that would be sensitive to cn - cycle neutrinos , and from which reliable terrestrial fluxes could be extracted .",
    "the analysis of @xcite , which examined whether cn neutrino experiments could place a significant constraint on the solar core s primordial metalicity , used previous ssm work in which the logarithmic partial derivatives @xmath26 for each neutrino flux @xmath27 are evaluated for the ssm input parameters @xmath28 , @xmath29 }   \\over \\partial \\ln{\\left [ \\beta_j / \\beta_j(0)\\right]}},\\ ] ] where @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote the ssm best values .",
    "this information , in combination with the assigned uncertainties in the 19 @xmath28 of the ssm , then provides an estimate of the uncertainty in the ssm prediction of @xmath27 .",
    "in particular , crucial to the current analysis is the dependence @xcite on the mass fractions ( measured relative to hydrogen ) of different heavy elements , @xmath32 having this information not as a function of the overall metalicity @xmath33 , but as a function of the individual abundances , allows one to separate the `` environmental '' effects of the metals in the solar core from the special role of primordial c and n as catalysts for the cn cycle . by environmental effects we mean the influence of the metals on the opacity and thus the ambient core temperature , which controls the rates of neutrino - producing reactions of both the pp - chain and cn cycle .",
    "in @xcite the temperature - dependent @xmath22b neutrino flux was used to calibrate the environmental effects of the metals and of other ssm parameters , thus isolating the special cn - cycle dependence on primordial c+n",
    ". this primordial abundance can be expressed , with very little residual solar model uncertainty , in terms of the measured @xmath22b neutrino flux and nuclear cross sections that have been determined in the laboratory .",
    "the partial derivatives allow one to define the power - law dependencies of neutrino fluxes , relative to the ssm best - value prediction @xmath30 @xmath34^{\\alpha(i , j ) } \\label{eq : prod}\\ ] ] where the product extends over @xmath35 ssm input parameters .",
    "this expression can be used to evaluate how ssm flux predictions will vary , relative to @xmath30 , as the @xmath28 are varied .",
    "alternatively , the process can be inverted : a flux measurement could in principle be used to constrain an uncertain input parameter .    the baseline ssm calculation used in @xcite ,",
    "bps08(ags ) @xcite , employed the recently determined ags abundances for the volatile elements c , n , o , ne , and ar , rather than the previous gs standard composition .",
    "it should be noted that ags includes a downward revision by 0.05 dex of the si photospheric abundance compared to gs and , accordingly , a similar reduction in the meteoritic abundances .",
    "the partial derivatives needed in the present calculation are summarized in tables [ table : one ] ( solar model parameters and nuclear cross sections ) and [ table : two ] ( abundances ) .",
    "the ssm estimate of uncertainties in the various solar neutrino fluxes @xmath27 can be obtained by folding the partial derivatives with the uncertainties in the underlying @xmath28 . in particular , it is convenient to decompose eq .",
    "( [ eq : prod ] ) into its dependence on solar parameters and non - cn metals , nuclear s - factors , and the primordial c and n abundances , @xmath36^{\\alpha(i , j ) }   \\prod_{j    \\in   \\mathrm{\\{nuclear\\ } } }    \\left [    { \\beta_j   \\over    \\beta_j(0 ) } \\right]^{\\alpha(i , j ) }   \\prod_{j \\in   \\mathrm{\\{c , n\\ } } }   \\left [ { \\beta_j   \\over \\beta_j(0 ) } \\right]^{\\alpha(i , j ) } \\label{eq : prod2}\\ ] ] where the first term will be designated the `` environmental '' uncertainty ",
    "ssm solar parameters and metal abundances that primarily influence neutrino flux predictions through changes they induce in the core temperature . these are , respectively , the uncertainties in the photon luminosity @xmath37 , the mean radiative opacity , the solar age , and calculated he and metal duffusion ; and the fractional abundances of o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , and fe .",
    "the estimated 1@xmath38 fractional uncertainties for the these parameters are given in @xcite .",
    "the abundances of mg , si , s , and fe are meteoritic , while those of the volatile elements c , n , o , ne , and ar are photospheric .",

    "the last term is the contribution of the primordial c and n abundances . as table [ table : two ] shows , pp - chain neutrino fluxes are relatively insensitive to variations in these abundances , as the heavier nuclei like fe have a more important influence on the core opacity .",
    "but the expected , nearly linear response of the @xmath20n and @xmath18o neutrino fluxes to these abundances is apparent .",
    "these are the abundances we would like to constrain by a future measurement of the @xmath20n and @xmath18o solar neutrino fluxes .",
    "such a measurement begins to be of interest if these abundances could be determined with an accuracy significantly better than 30% .",
    "were one to vary the 11 ssm parameters designated as `` environmental '' according to their assigned uncertainties ( taking them to be uncorrelated ) , a 7.5% ssm net uncertainty in @xmath45 would be obtained .",
    "this uncertainty would be one of dominant ones in the analysis of present interest .",
    "but , as discussed in @xcite in more detail , these environmental uncertainties influence neutrino fluxes through their impact on the core temperature , regardless of the details of which parameters are varied .",
    "consequently , there are strong environmental correlations between different neutrino fluxes , allowing one to form ratios of fluxes that are much less sensitive to environmental effects .",
    "furthermore these correlations remain valid for parameter variations far outside accepted ssm uncertainties .",
    "this is illustrated in the ssm monte carlo tests represented in fig .",
    "[ fig : three ] .",
    "one finds that a flux ratio such as @xmath46 where the exponent @xmath47 is taken from the fit shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : three ] , is much less sensitive to environmental uncertainties than either the numerator or denominator separately .",
    "this is apparent from the entries in tables [ table : one ] and [ table : two ] .",
    "as @xmath48 can be taken from sk and sno measurements , most of the environmental uncertainty in predicting @xmath49 can be eliminated .",
