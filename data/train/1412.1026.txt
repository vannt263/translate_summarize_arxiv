    "the effective one- or two - dimensional dirac equation describes surprising variety of physical systems .",
    "it appears in effective models of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the quantum field theory @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , in the andreev approximation of the bogoliubov - de gennes equations of superconductivity @xcite , or in the effective description of the low - energy charge carriers in graphene and related carbon nanostructures @xcite . in all these scenarios ,",
    "the explicit solution of dynamical equations is desirable .",
    "however , it can not be found rather frequently due to analytically intractable form of interaction .",
    "here , the importance of exactly solvable models comes out . despite their family",
    "is rather limited , they can be adjusted to the required physical situation by variety of methods .",
    "unitary transformations in quantum mechanics are convenient tool for making calculations more feasible , however , they are usually not considered to have much physical importance as the unitarily equivalent quantum systems provide the same physical predictions .",
    "nonetheless , the unitary transformation can relate two systems whose physical interpretation is substantially different from each other . as an example , let us mention the free massless dirac particle on the real line whose hamiltonian reads @xmath0 .",
    "the unitary transformation @xmath1 gives rise to the operator @xmath2 that can be interpreted as the hamiltonian of dirac fermion in carbon nanotube in presence of a scalar potential @xmath3 .",
    "the relation between @xmath4 and @xmath5 has a nontrivial physical impact here ; it explains the absence of backscattering of dirac quasiparticles on impurities in carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "two quantum systems related by unitary transformation have the same energy spectrum ; they are _",
    "isospectral_. all the relevant properties of the transformed system can be effortlessly obtained from the initial model .",
    "similar advantage is offered by the supersymmetric quantum mechanics , where the unitary equivalence is generalized by the intertwining relation @xmath6 and its conjugate . instead of unitarity",
    ", the intertwining operator @xmath7 , known also as darboux transformation , satisfies @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a ( polynomial ) function of the initial hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "this transformation was discussed in @xcite for the one - dimensional dirac operators where explicit formulas for @xmath5 satisfying the intertwining relations for a fixed @xmath4 and @xmath7 were provided .",
    "the scalar potential is invariant with respect to the darboux transformation @xmath7 , i.e. it has the same form in both @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the spectra of @xmath5 and @xmath4 are identical up to a finite number of energy levels ; the systems are _ almost isospectral_. the dirac hamiltonians @xmath4 and @xmath5 intertwined by @xmath7 describe different interactions in general .",
    "for instance , @xmath5 can represent the hamiltonian of radially twisted carbon nanotubes whereas @xmath4 is associated with a twist - free nanotubes , see @xcite .",
    "we aim to construct the new , solvable , one - dimensional dirac hamiltonian that would describe dirac fermions in graphene in presence of an inhomogeneous electromagnetic field .",
    "the procedure should allow us to modify the scalar potential and to introduce or maintain a constant mass term .",
    "the initial and the transformed hamiltonians do not need to be isospectral .",
    "we are rather interested in the systems where the isospectrality of @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( @xmath10 ) is generalized by the _ spectral isomorphism _ , defined in terms of a real function @xmath11 ,",
    "@xmath12 the construction will be divided into two independent steps .",
    "the first step comprises of the special unitary transformation whereas the second one allows us to modify the spectrum of the operator globally , introducing spectrally isomorphic systems in a simple way .",

    "the pseudo - spin distinguishes two triangular sublattices of the hexagonal lattice .",
    "the mass term @xmath16 makes the two sublattices inequivalent ; it is absent in the suspended graphene but can appear when the graphene sheet is posed on a substrate , e.g. on the crystal of hexagonal boron - nitride @xcite .",
    "we will focus on the settings with translational invariance in one direction .",
    "we suppose that the pseudo - magnetic and magnetic field have nonvanishing @xmath17-component only , @xmath18 @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 . for convenience",
    ", we will work with the rescaled coordinates @xmath23 , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are dimensionless quantities and @xmath27 has dimension of length ( it can be identified with the magnetic length @xmath28 for instance ) .",
    "after the substitution and separation of variables @xmath29 , the equation ( [ h ] ) can be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are dimensionless quantities .",
    "we used suggestively the tilded notation in ( [ tildehh ] ) as we shall construct solvable hamiltonians of this type .",
    "let us take a generic one - dimensional dirac operator @xmath4 , @xmath35 with real , sufficiently smooth , functions @xmath3 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 do not vanish simultaneously .",
    "we are looking for a `` gauge '' transformation @xmath38 that would change @xmath4 to @xmath5 of ( [ tildehh ] ) , @xmath39 we take @xmath38 as an element of the @xmath40 group , @xmath41 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 are real and continuous functions .",
    "transformation of the kinetic term of @xmath4 results in the following expression @xmath44\\partial_{x}+\\dots.,\\ ] ] where the dots represent the terms without derivative .",
    "we require the coefficient at the derivative to be constant .",
    "it can be satisfied by the following simple ansatz for @xmath38 , @xmath45 substituting this expression into ( [ tildeh ] ) , we get @xmath46 the mass term @xmath47 is required to be a non - negative constant .",
    "it can be achieved by @xmath48 where the functions @xmath49 and @xmath50 are fixed as @xmath51    the functions ( [ gauge ] ) have to be real .",
    "one can check , @xmath52 , @xmath53 . then",
    "the argument of the square root in @xmath54 is real if and only if @xmath55 . the left - hand side is always positive .",
    "whenever @xmath56 , the right - hand side is negative and the inequality is satisfied .",
    "for @xmath57 , the inequality is satisfied again as it reduces to @xmath58 .",
    "the same conclusion can be obtained for @xmath59 . ]",
    "that this requirement is satisfied whenever @xmath60 .",
    "besides , the gauge transformation @xmath38 has to be continuous .",
    "otherwise , it would introduce discontinuities into the wave functions .",
    "as @xmath61 and @xmath62 are continuous , we can analyze the continuity of @xmath49 and @xmath50 in the @xmath63-plane , taking @xmath61 and @xmath62 as two independent variables .",
    "the function @xmath64 has discontinuity at @xmath65 for @xmath66 whereas @xmath67 has discontinuity at @xmath65 for @xmath68 , see fig.[fig01 ] for illustration .",
    "hence , the continuous gauge transformation @xmath38 can be constructed as long as the values of @xmath61 and @xmath62 of the seed hamiltonian avoid one of the indicated discontinuities at least . substituting ( [ gauge ] ) into ( [ potentials ] ) , we get @xmath69    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     addition of the mass term into",
    "the two gap hamiltonian @xmath70 opens an additional central gap in the spectrum of @xmath71 that corresponds to the three - gap system , see fig .",

    "this is underlined by the fact that its potential term solves the corresponding nonlinear equation of the ablowitz - kaup - newell - segur ( akns ) hierarchy . defining @xmath72",
    ", it solves @xmath73 @xmath74 where @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",
    "let us notice that both the two - gap hamiltonian @xmath70 and the three - gap operator @xmath71 have a nontrivial integrals of motion represented by a higher - order differential operators with matrix coefficients .",
    "their existence emerges as a consequence of ( [ akns ] ) , see e.g. @xcite for details on their generic construction .",
    "the unitary transformation allows to construct dirac hamiltonian with the oscillating electromagnetic field .",
    "the transformation ( [ gauge ] ) is well defined ( the functions @xmath49 and @xmath50 are continuous and real ) since we take @xmath77 and @xmath61 is bounded .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath5 has the following potential terms @xmath78 in dependence on the parameters @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath47 , the two potentials can acquire remarkable variety of profiles , see fig .",

    "for instance , the vector potential can exhibit only mild oscillations around a non - zero constant that are negligible in comparison to the amplitude of the electrostatic potential , see fig .",
    "[ lame1]b ) . this system can be seen as an approximation of the setting where dirac particle travels in the @xmath81 periodic array of electrostatic barriers with the momentum @xmath82 parallel to the barriers .",
    "the small , periodic fluctuations of @xmath83 in our model facilitate solution of the stationary equation that would nt be analytically solvable for constant @xmath84 .",
    "when @xmath85 , the reflection symmetry of the scalar potential @xmath86 is spoiled , see fig .",

    "instead , the potential seems to be odd with respect to the reflection within the finite intervals determined by two consecutive extrema of the potential .",
    "in the article , we focused on the construction of solvable dirac operators with inhomogeneous vector and scalar potential , and constant ( possibly vanishing ) mass .",
    "the core of our results represents the unitary transformation ( [ g ] ) , ( [ gauge ] ) that brings a generic one - dimensional dirac operator into the required form .",
    "we illustrated its application on the special class of solvable models that are based on the mass - less , solvable dirac operator with pure vector potential .",
    "we showed that solvability of these systems is not compromised by addition of the mass term , yet the spectrum changes globally and gives rise to the spectral isomorphism ( [ ee ] ) between the systems .",
    "the constructed models were used in description of dirac fermions in graphene in presence of an inhomogeneous electromagnetic field .",
    "we presented solvable models where the particle experiences localized as well as periodic electromagnetic barrier .",
    "the two settings with localized barrier proved to be good approximation for magnetic field induced either on the edge of the magnetized film ( [ morse ] ) or by a magnetized strip of finite width ( [ scarfspec ] ) . in case of the periodic array of barriers ,",
    "the system with two gaps in the spectrum served as the initial `` seed '' system .",
    "we constructed a spectrally isomorphic hamiltonian with three spectral gaps and discussed some its peculiar properties , e.g. its relation to the akns hierarchy of integrable systems ( [ akns ] ) .",
    "the presented procedure is complementary to the existing methods , namely to the darboux transformation @xcite .",
    "the latter one can transform an initial dirac operator into an ( almost ) isospectral hamiltonian with altered vector potential and mass term .",
    "the presented unitary transformation can set the mass to a constant and induce an inhomogeneous scalar potential .",
    "it can provide the new isospectral partners of the recently discussed dirac systems with reflection - less potential @xcite , @xcite or inhomogeneous magnetic fields @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is worth noticing that a different approach to construction of solvable systems described by dirac equation was developed in @xcite .",
    "there , a transformation involving analytic continuation of parameters was discussed that allowed to get new solvable dirac operators from the known ones with , in specific manner interchanged , vector and scalar potentials .",
    "it would be interesting to consider spectral isomorphism for generic finite - gap systems .",
    "in particular , it should be understood how the procedure , which maps an @xmath87gap hamiltonian to an @xmath88-gap one , is reflected by the associated equations of the akns hierarchy , or manifested in the structure of ( lax ) integrals of motion associated with the finite - gap hamiltonians . in this context",
    ", the results on of the hidden nonlinear supersymmetry of the finite - gap systems could be particularly useful @xcite .    as the operator @xmath89 represents a schrdinger operator with matrix potential ( the antidiagonal terms with first derivative",
    "can be transformed out be an additional unitary transformation ) , the presented procedure can be beneficial for analysis of these nonrelativistic systems that are of growing interest recently @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the presented construction was primarily aimed at derivation of explicit exactly solvable models .",
    "however , it can be utilized for qualitative analysis as well .",
    "the hamiltonians @xmath71 were discussed qualitatively in @xcite , where a set of sufficient conditions for existence of bound states was derived . with the use of the unitary transformation ( [ gauge ] ) , those qualitative results are directly applicable on a class of operators @xmath5 with inhomogeneous vector and scalar potential .",
