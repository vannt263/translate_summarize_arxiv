    "to simplify , we restrict our description to the case of three particles relevant to this article , a generalization to an arbitrary number of particles is straightforward . it is plausible that in a system of coordinates @xmath67 for the center of mass    @xmath68    and the two relative positions @xmath69    a diagonal matrix structure is a good choice . in these coordinates the center of mass is separated and we introduce the gaussian width parameter @xmath70 for its motion .",

    "this transition is discussed in more detail in the next two sections .",
    "it is also expected that the worst approximation in the low - temperature limit is obtained by the 1pd - fg ansatz . as was mentioned in sec.[sec : frozen_gaussian ] the diagonal width matrix does not treat the free center of mass motion correctly .",
    "this manifests itself as a large deviation of the mean energy from the correct value for @xmath105 .",
    "the energy calculated with the diagonal frozen gaussian width matrix increases for temperatures below @xmath106 , and this is definitely wrong .",

    "more interesting , however , is the comparison of the 2p - fg and the sp - tg propagators .",
    "as reported in previous investigation of larger clusters @xcite the single - particle thawed gaussian approximation shows results for the mean energy and the specific heat which are qualitatively in agreement with the full matrix case .",

    "however , as can be seen in fig.[fig : r10](a ) the description of the mean energy of the sp - tg and the 2p - fg methods is of similar quality at very low temperatures .",
    "this is a remarkable finding since the evaluation of the single - particle thawed gaussian propagator is more expensive than the frozen gaussian due to the need to propagate the width matrix elements in time .",
    "by contrast , the specific heat curve of the 2p - fg propagator is closer to that of the 1pd - fg than to the two thawed gaussian approximations which agree very well with each other .",
    "it seems that in the temperature region around the transition from the bound to the dissociated cluster , a thawed gaussian can provide a better description .",

    "here , down to a temperature of @xmath110 the two thawed gaussian approximations and the 2p - fg propagator provide almost identical results .",
    "the lines lie on top of each other both for the mean energy and the specific heat .",
    "only the 1pd - fg values deviate a bit from the three other methods .    in summary",
    ", we can state that the thawed gaussian propagator with a full matrix provides the best approximation which deviates in the low - temperature limit only slightly from the exact result and almost reaches the ground level for @xmath111 . in all cases in which the high accuracy of the full matrix thawed gaussian propagator is not required or in which the integration of the equations of motion for the width parameters of a full matrix is too expensive",
    ", the frozen gaussian ansatz with two parameters ( 2p - fg ) seems to be the best choice .",
    "it provides the same quality of results as the single - particle thawed gaussian propagator but is much easier to evaluate since no integrations of parameters of the width matrix are required .      before discussing the dissociation process in more detail we have to investigate the influence of the confining sphere on the mean energy and the specific heat .",
    "while often a very restrictive value of the confining radius @xmath90 is chosen@xcite , our calculations demonstrate that its value significantly affects the thermodynamic properties of the clusters unless large values , drastically exceeding a few ngstrms , are used .",

    "[ fig : r_values](b ) ] , which , as was discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : results_comparison ] , describes the quantum behavior correctly .",
    "the values @xmath115 , and @xmath98 have already been used in ref .  .",
    "the qualitative behavior of these three curves differs strongly .",
    "in particular , the mean energy for @xmath116 shows a significant increase of the slope for temperatures above @xmath117 . in ref .",
    "this was regarded as an indication that this radius allows for a total fragmentation of the cluster .",
    "however , the mean energy for higher temperatures reveals that this is not fulfilled completely .",
    "we included the line for @xmath118 in the figure , which corresponds to three free particles .",
    "the mean energy for the restriction @xmath119 does not reach that line even at @xmath120 .",
    "however , for the weaker restrictions @xmath121 one can observe that actually a total fragmentation takes place and that for @xmath122 the energy is identical to that of three free particles . in fig .",
    "[ fig : r_values](a ) we also included the line @xmath123 with the potential minimum @xmath124 .",
    "this line corresponds to the classical expectation at low temperatures for the internal rotations and oscillations of the trimer plus the energy of the free center of mass .",
    "even though the behavior at very low ( @xmath125 ) and high temperatures ( @xmath126 ) agrees well for all confinements @xmath127 the transition itself obviously depends more critically on the value of @xmath90 .",
    "it is clear that a confining radius @xmath116 is too restrictive and does not describe the cluster correctly .",
    "a significantly larger confining radius @xmath128 is required . for the largest confining radii used in fig .",
    "[ fig : r_values ] we observe convergence , i.e. , a further expansion of the confining sphere does not change the results significantly .",
    "we note that it becomes increasingly difficult to converge the monte - carlo integrations for the classical and the 2p - fg partition function for increasing @xmath90 .",
    "similarly , the large error bars in the path - integral monte carlo calculation of ref .   indicate that in their computations a radius of @xmath116 was already challenging .",
    "nevertheless , the results presented in fig .  [ fig : r_values ] demonstrate that the added effort of increasing @xmath90 beyond @xmath129 is essential .",
    "the necessity for a thorough investigation of the correct boundary conditions is already known from classical investigations of atomic clusters .",
    "etters and kaelberer @xcite demonstrated the negative influence of too restrictive boxes on the classical average energy .      the cluster at a confinement of @xmath130 can be regarded as converged with respect to @xmath90 .",
    "the artificial confinement does not have a further noticeable influence on the thermodynamic properties .",
    "this allows us to discuss the features observed in the mean energy and the specific heat in more detail .",
    "additionally , the various gaussian propagators used to obtain the quantum properties agree with each other to a high precision , so that we may consider them as converged in the sense that the choice of gaussian method has no further influence .",
    "as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : r32 ] the qualitative behavior in the quantum and classical cases is almost the same .",
    "the cluster is bound at low temperatures , shows a relatively sharp transition , and is completely dissociated for temperatures @xmath131 .",
    "for very low temperatures the classical mean energy exhibits the expected behavior @xmath132 [ cf .  also fig .",
    "[ fig : r_values](a ) ] for the system ( free center of mass , rotations and oscillations of the internal degrees of freedom ) , whereas the fc - tg mean energy ( best approximation , see sec .",
    "[ sec : results_comparison ] ) converges to a value close to that of the ground level .",
    "further differences between the classical and quantum mechanical results are found in the transition region .",
    "it is shifted to slightly lower temperatures in the quantum calculations as compared to the classical .",
    "all quantum calculations show a maximum of the specific heat at @xmath117 , while the classical maximum is at @xmath133 .",
    "one reason for this shift is the presence of the zero point energy in the quantum system . as is already obvious in fig .",
    "[ fig : r_values ] the classical and quantum results agree very well in the high - temperature limit , since both trend to the case of three free particles .",
    "thus , we conclude that the transition observed in the cluster of three argon atoms is a classical phenomenon .",
    "the only difference between classical and quantum mechanics is in the temperature at which the transition occurs .",
    "we note that etters and kaelberer @xcite reported a `` liquid - gas transition '' identified by the absence of bounded atom configurations in a classical investigation of the system with `` free - surface boundary conditions '' , i.e. , without a confining sphere , at @xmath134 , which is in good agreement with our results .",
    "our finding of a classical - like complete dissociation of the trimer in one step differs from the conclusions of prez de tudela et al.@xcite . while the mean energy in the calculations of ref",
    ".   for @xmath116 shows a larger and larger slope for increasing temperatures up to @xmath135 we observe already a decrease of the slope for temperatures @xmath136 .",
    "the difference relative to the path - integral monte carlo calculations becomes even more pronounced in the specific heat .",
    "prez de tudela et al .",
    "@xcite report that they find an  apparent \" maximum which evolves with the radius @xmath90 of the confinement and appears slightly below @xmath137 for @xmath116 .",
    "the absence of an unambiguous maximum was seen as an indication for structural changes of the cluster instead of a proper `` phase transition '' .",
    "although the dissociation of the cluster is not fully achieved for such a strong confinement , it is clear from the gaussian methods used in this article that already for @xmath116 a pronounced peak in the specific heat indicating the dissociation of the system at @xmath138 is present ( cf .",
    "[ fig : r10 ] ) . describing",
    "the cluster with a weaker confinement correctly reveals the unambiguous dissociation without intermediate structural modification as discussed above .    the very low temperature found for the dissociation of the cluster may also be important for rare gas clusters in general .",
    "as was already discussed@xcite , even for a confining sphere with @xmath139 , the transition temperature of @xmath140 is lower than temperatures discussed for structural transformations or a `` melting '' of clusters .",
    "features indicating such changes have , e.g. , been found beyond @xmath141 for argon @xcite . if one considers that the dissociation temperature is actually even lower ( @xmath142 , c.f .",
    "[ fig : r32 ] ) , one necessarily concludes that it is wrong to ignore the influence of the confining sphere on such properties . in larger neon clusters ( @xmath1 and",
    "@xmath2 ) features in the mean energy or the specific heat which were related to structural changes , have been reported between @xmath143 and @xmath144 @xcite .",
    "these temperatures are lower than the dissociation found here , however , one may expect that at least a partial dissociation can set in much earlier in larger clusters since they contain higher energies . in the numerical simulations @xcite the confining radii",
    "are chosen such that no atom can leave the cluster during the time evolution .",
    "our results indicate that such a constraint might be too restrictive and lead to incorrect conclusions .",
    "a partial or full dissociation can influence structural transformations and may even set in before structural changes of an artificially confined cluster can occur .",
    "in the present article we investigated the argon trimer by means of semiclassical gaussian approximations to the boltzmann operator .",
    "we introduced a new matrix structure for a frozen gaussian variant of the imaginary time propagator which is capable of correctly dealing with the free center of mass motion of a cluster of atoms in cartesian coordinates . with this matrix structure",
    "we were able to show that the frozen gaussian propagator is , in spite of its simplicity , competitive with numerically more expensive thawed gaussian variants .",
    "in particular , the frozen gaussian method provides the same quality thermodynamic results as the so - called single - particle thawed gaussian propagator , which in addition to the time - dependent variables of the frozen gaussian requires the time evolution for the elements of a block - diagonal width matrix .",
    "this is especially true in the low - temperature limit , where quantum effects become important and the form of the semiclassical approximation is supposed to have the largest influence .",
    "our results suggest that the frozen gaussian ansatz with two parameters ( 2p - fg ) introduced in this article is the method of choice in all cases in which the higher accuracy of the full matrix thawed gaussian propagator is not required or in which the integration of the equations of motion for the width parameters of a full matrix is too expensive .    the evaluation of the mean energy and the specific heat for the cluster of three argon atoms demonstrated that a previous investigation of the system @xcite used too restrictive confinements to describe the dissociation behavior of the system correctly . above @xmath145",
    "the cluster directly dissociates into three free atoms , as is evident from the gaussian calculations presented in this article .",
    "this dissociation is almost purely classical , the influence of quantum mechanics is only found in a convergence to the ground state energy instead of the classical potential minimum for @xmath105 and in a slight shift of the three - body dissociation transition to higher classical temperatures ( @xmath146 ) which we attribute to the zero point energy of quantum mechanics .",
    "the clear and pronounced transition found in this article supports the conclusion of ref .   that the dissociation of the atoms from the cluster is important when reconfigurations of the internal structure are considered .",
    "our results strongly indicate that the confinement to very small spheres usually applied in the calculation of the partition function and values deduced from it @xcite might be too restrictive to fully understand the low - temperature behavior of the clusters .",
    "the dissociation can set in before structural changes or a melting can be observed . to make a clear statement on this question",
    "it is necessary to advance the investigations done here to clusters with higher numbers of atoms . in particular , the cases of @xmath147 @xcite , @xmath148 @xcite , @xmath1 @xcite or @xmath2 @xcite examined recently are of special interest .    on the technical side , it is known that both the frozen and thawed gaussian propagators used here are , in the framework of a generalized time - dependent perturbation theory @xcite , the lowest order approximations in a series converging to the exact quantum propagator @xcite .",
    "higher orders can help to understand the thermodynamic properties better and to verify the results obtained here with a higher accuracy .",
    "furthermore , the corrections obtained by the evaluation of higher order terms provide objective access to the quality with which the gaussian approximations reflect the quantum effects in the system studied .",
    "they are the topic of current studies ."
