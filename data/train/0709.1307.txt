    "the most popular method for differential gene expression detection in two - sample microarray studies is to compute the t - statistics .",
    "the differentially expressed genes are those whose t - statistics exceed a certain threshold .",
    "recently , due to the realization that in many cancer studies , many genes show increased expressions in disease samples , but only for a small number of those samples .",
    "the study of @xcite shows that t - statistics has low power in this case , and they introduced the so - called  cancer outlier profile analysis \" ( copa ) .",
    "their study shows clearly that copa can perform better than the traditional t - statistics for cancer microarray data sets .",
    "more recently , several progresses have been made in this direction with the aim to design better statistics to account for the heterogeneous activation pattern of the cancer genes . in @xcite",
    ", the authors introduced a new statistics , which they called outlier sum .",
    "later , @xcite proposed outlier robust t - statistics ( ort ) and showed it usually outperformed the previously proposed ones in both simulation study and application to real data set .    in this paper",
    ", we propose another statistics for the detection of cancer differential gene expression which have similar power to ort when the number of activated samples are very small , but perform betters when more samples are differentially expressed .",
    "we call our new method the maximum ordered subset t - statistics ( most ) . through simulation studies we found the new statistics outperformed the previously proposed ones under some circumstances and never significantly worse in all situations .",
    "thus we think it is a valuable addition to the dictionary of cancer outlier expression detection .",
    "we consider the simple 2-class microarray data for detecting cancer genes .",
    "we assume there are @xmath0 normal samples and @xmath1 cancer samples .",
    "the gene expressions for normal samples are denoted by @xmath2 for genes @xmath3 and samples @xmath4 , while @xmath5 denote the expressions for cancer samples with @xmath3 and @xmath6 . in this paper , we are only interested in one - sided test where the activated genes from cancer samples have a higher expression level .",
    "the extension to two - sided test is straightforward .",
    "the usual t - statistics ( up to a multiplication factor independent of genes ) for two - sample test of differences in means is defined for each gene @xmath7 by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the average expression of gene @xmath7 in normal samples , @xmath10 is the average expression of gene @xmath7 in cancer samples , and @xmath11 is the usual pooled standard deviation estimate @xmath12 the t - statistics is powerful when the alternative distribution is such that @xmath13 all come from a distribution with a higher mean . @xcite",
    "argues that for most cancer types , heterogeneous activation patterns make t - statistics inefficient for detecting those expression profiles .",
    "they defined the copa statistics @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the @xmath16th percentile of the data , @xmath17 is the median of the pooled samples for gene @xmath7 , and @xmath18 is the median absolute deviation of the pooled samples .",
    "the choice of @xmath16 in ( [ copa ] ) depends on the subjective judgement of the user .",
    "the use of @xmath19 and @xmath20 to replace the mean and the standard deviation in ( [ t ] ) is due to robustness considerations since it is already known that some of the genes are differentially expressed .    in ( [ copa ] )",
    ", only one value of @xmath21 is used in the computation .",
    "a more efficient strategy would be to use additional expression values .",
    "let @xmath22 be the outliers from the cancer samples for gene @xmath7 , where @xmath23 is the interquartile range of the data .",
    "the os statistics from @xcite is then defined as @xmath24 more recently , @xcite studied ort statistics , which is similar to os statistics .",
    "the important difference that makes ort superior is that outliers are defined relative to the normal sample instead of the pooled sample .",
    "so in their definition , @xmath25 by similar reasoning @xmath19 in os is replaced by @xmath26 and @xmath27 by @xmath28 , where @xmath26 and @xmath29 are the medians of normal and cancer samples respectively .    in both os and ort statistics ,",
    "the outliers are defined somewhat arbitrarily with no convincing reasons . to address this question ,",
    "we propose the following statistics that implicitly considers all possible values for outlier thresholds .",
    "suppose for notational simplicity that @xmath30 are ordered for each @xmath7 : @xmath31 if the number of samples where oncogenes are activated were known , we would naturally define the statistics as @xmath32 when @xmath33 is not known to us , one would be tempted to define @xmath34 but this does not quite work since obviously @xmath35 for different values of @xmath33 are not directly comparable under the null distribution that @xmath36 . for example , when @xmath37 , we have @xmath38>0 $ ] while @xmath39=0 $ ] .",
    "this observation motivates us to normalize @xmath35 such that each approximately has mean @xmath40 and variance @xmath41 .",
    "this can be achieved by defining @xmath42 $ ] and @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the order statistics of @xmath1 samples generated from the standard normal distribution",
    ". then we can define @xmath35 as : @xmath45 so that @xmath35 has mean and variance approximately equal to @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively .",
    "finally we can define our new statistics ( called most ) as @xmath34 with most , we practically consider every possible threshold above which @xmath5 are taken to be outliers . in this formulation , the number of outliers is implicitly defined as @xmath46    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "some simulations are carried out to study most , and compare its performance to os , ort , copa , and t - statistics .",
    "for copa , we choose to use the @xmath47th percentile in its definition as in @xcite .",
    "we generate the expression data from standard normal with @xmath48 . for various values @xmath49 , which is the number of differentially expressed cancer samples",
    ", a constant @xmath50 is added for differentially expressed genes .",
    "we simulated @xmath51 differentially and non - differentially expressed genes , and calculated the roc curves from them by choosing different thresholds for gene calls .",
    "figure [ roc1 ] and [ roc2 ] plots the roc curves for some combinations of @xmath33 and @xmath50 . for @xmath52 and @xmath33 small ,",
    "all five statistics behave similarly with t - statistics performing the worst .",
    "as @xmath33 increases , t becomes better and os and copa begin to lose power . for @xmath53 and medium to large @xmath33 ,",
    "the performance of most is only worse than t and better than other statistics .",
    "smaller @xmath33 in this case basically leads to roc curve that is close to a @xmath54 line for all statistics since the signal @xmath53 is too weak in this case , so we do not show these results . for @xmath55 and small @xmath33 ,",
    "most is better than ort , copa and t , and in this situation only os is competitive with most .",
    "larger @xmath33 in this case will produce nearly perfect roc curves for all statistics , and thus those results are also omitted . besides roc curves , we have also tried examining the possibility of using ( [ k ] ) for estimating the number of differentially expressed samples @xmath33 , but so far have been unable to get a reasonable estimate out of it .    from the above simulations",
    ", we judge that our new estimate most is at least as good as other previously proposed statistics , sometimes much better .",
    "thus it is a valuable tool for detecting activated genes in many situations .    as an example of real data application ,",
    "the data from @xcite is publicly available from http://data.cgt.duke.edu/west.php .",
    "the microarray used in the breast cancer study contains 7129 genes and 49 tumor samples , 25 of which with no positive lymph nodes identified and the other 24 with positive nodes . similar to @xcite , we take the log transformation of the expressions after normalizing the data .",
    "we apply most to the data and compare it to the t - statistics by computing the fdr using the sam approach ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fdr ] plots the fdr versus the number of genes called significant . for this example , most seems to perform a little better than t - statistics , although the difference is too small to be of any significance .",
