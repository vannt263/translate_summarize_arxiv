    "the assumption @xmath277 implies that @xmath278 . along the same lines as above and in theorem  [ th : decay ]",
    "it follows that @xmath279 and @xmath280 and consequently @xmath281 , similar for @xmath282 .",
    "thus if the window ( i.e.  pulse shape ) @xmath1 satisfies the properties of corollary  [ cor : tight ] the orthogonalization procedure   yields a function that is in the same space ( in the same _ algebra _ ) as the function @xmath1 , and the quality of decay does not change . also yields a characterization of the decay properties of paraunitary modulated filter banks . ]    for a window @xmath1 with exponential decay ( in time and frequency ) it has been shown that @xmath255 also has exponential decay ( see  @xcite for a proof for @xmath38 , this result has later been extended to @xmath0 , cf .",
    "however , similar to the dual window , in general the exponent for the decay of @xmath255 will be smaller than for @xmath1 .",
    "since the gaussian is optimally localized in the time - frequency plane , in the sense that it minimizes the uncertainty principle , it is interesting to note that for @xmath283 the function @xmath255 has only exponential decay in time and frequency , cf .",
    "thus we certainly loose some time - frequency localization in this case , although the resulting function @xmath255 still has exponential decay .",
    "thus it seems there exists a large class of windows whose time - frequency localization properties are not affected by applying  .",
    "this is however only half of the truth , since in the considerations above we have ignored any constants that come into play .",
    "this is acceptable from an asymptotic - analysis viewpoint , but not for applications .",
    "consider for example the following situation .",
    "take a window @xmath1 with exponential decay in time and frequency and assume that @xmath284 constitutes a frame for @xmath249 .",
    "then for any @xmath285 there exists an @xmath216 such that for @xmath286 @xmath287 since @xmath288 for @xmath289 ( see  @xcite for a mathematically precise formulation ) .",
    "but of course @xmath290 leads to an unacceptable large loss of capacity for ofdm , already @xmath291 seems to be prohibitive in this context .",
    "on the other hand , if we let @xmath292 , then @xmath255 and @xmath2 will become increasingly `` ill - localized '' in the time - frequency plane ( since in the limit case @xmath247 we are confronted with the balian - low theorem ) , although from theory we know that @xmath255 has exponential decay as long as @xmath249 . however , as pointed out earlier , this decay involves a constant @xmath293 that depends on the ratio of the frame bounds . since @xmath294 for @xmath292 it follows that @xmath295 .",
    "thus for applications such as ofdm the exponential - decay property of @xmath2 and @xmath255 quickly becomes meaningless for @xmath296 close to 1 .",
    "if we choose a well - localized window , there is a trade - off between increasing @xmath296 and increasing the frame bound ratio @xmath297 . hence a correct formulation from a practical viewpoint of the",
