    "plasmonics encompasses the science and technology of plasmons which are the collective oscillations of electrons mainly in metals . in particular ,",
    "the coupling of plasmons with photons give rise to a hybrid quasiparticle known as the surface plasmon - polariton ( also called surface - plasmon )  @xcite , which can propagate along metal surfaces . as a result",
    ", light can be coupled to , and propagate through structures that are much smaller than it s wavelength .",
    "thus , plasmonics enables the subwavelength photonics  @xcite and bridges it to electronics at nanoscale and offers promising applications in nano - optics and electronics such as lasing , sensing @xcite .",
    "+ in this context , the coupling between the surface plasmon polaritons and the dielectric waveguide modes is of interest for integrated optoelectronic applications .",
    "much effort has been devoted to understand and enhance this coupling in guided mode geometries  @xcite and in layered systems  @xcite . in particular , a recent work describes the resonant interaction model between the surface - plasmons on a metal surface and a soliton in a nonlinear dielectric medium .",
    "@xcite in that model , the interaction depends on , and hence can be controlled by the soliton amplitude which leads to coupled surface - plasmon ",
    "soliton modes , and provides a novel way of manipulating the surface plasmon propagation .",
    "motivated by this study , we propose in this paper that a weakly coupled nonlinear dielectric waveguide surface - plasmon system can be formulated as a new type of ` dielectric waveguide  surface - plasmon josephson junction ( dwsp - jj ) ' and investigate its dynamics within the model introduced in ref .  @xcite .",
    "this formulation enables a remarkable connection between this optical system and the well - known josephson - junction dynamics of bose - einstein atomic condensates  @xcite and opens a new perspective to quantum plasmonics , where novel quantum optical phenomena can be realized and utilized via coupling to surface plasmons .",
    "@xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : theory ] , the theoretical model is introduced .",

    "this intuitive model consists of the co - propagating optical soliton and surface - plasmon ( sp ) electric fields along a metal - dielectric interface  @xcite .",
    "the nonlinearity in the dielectric is assumed to be confined at a distance , @xmath1 , from the metal interface such that the surface - plasmon propagation retains linearity , and the weak coupling between the soliton and sp - fields can be treated perturbatively .",
    "assuming translational invariance in the @xmath2 direction , and choosing @xmath3 as the propagation direction , the total electric field of the coupled system is written in the form , @xmath4 } , \\label{eq : totalfield}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 are the surface - plasmon and soliton amplitudes , multiplied by the respective transverse profiles with @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the propagation wavevector is @xmath8 whereas @xmath9 is the surface - plasmon wavevector .",
    "the nonlinearity parameter of the dielectric medium is @xmath10 .",
    "this product ansatz for the lateral and longitudinal field profiles reduces the system to essentially a one - dimensional problem , where the amplitudes @xmath5 obey the following coupled oscillator equations , that are written in the dimensionless coordinate @xmath11    @xmath12    here , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the propagation constants .",
    "the coupling parameter is given by @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the rationale of this functional form is that the lateral tail of the soliton field , which depends on the soliton amplitude @xmath16 , acts as a source to excite the surface plasmons . substituting @xmath17 and employing the slowly varying amplitude approximation , the following set of equations",
    "are obtained for the amplitudes @xmath18    @xmath19    in eq .",

    "@xcite we observe that the dwsp - jj equations would reduce to that of the bjj model for a constant coupling parameter @xmath40 provided that the other parameters are scaled accordingly .",

    ", an isolated sjj can exhibit coherent cooper - pair oscillations only at very small amplitudes  @xcite . by virtue of the oscillating current ,",
    "the sjj is generally discussed in terms of a rigid pendulum analogy .",
    "on the other hand , the bjj dynamics resembles to that of a nonrigid pendulum with length - dependent angular momentum ( @xmath36 )  @xcite .    in the bjj ,",
    "the double - well trap is created by a laser field barrier that divides a single trapped condensate in two parts .",
    "hence , the asymmetry of the wells ( @xmath43 , as well as the barrier height ( i.e. coupling ) is controlled _ externally _ by the laser field . the coupling can further be modulated temporally by the laser beam .    to this end",
    ", we stress that the presence of @xmath36-dependent nonlinear coupling in dwsp - jj implies fundamentally different dynamical features from the bjj and sjj models , particularly in certain parameter regimes , as discussed in the next section .",

    "equation  ( [ eq : dwsp_jj_z ] ) shows that the fixed points occur at ( @xmath44=@xmath45 ) or ( @xmath44=@xmath46 ) with the respective population imbalance values determined from @xmath47    we investigate the range @xmath48 , and @xmath49 including the resonant coupling ( @xmath50 )  @xcite . for the scaled distance parameter",

    "for @xmath61 ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3](a ) ) , the zero - phase and @xmath0-phase modes exhibit similar behavior , with rigid - pendulum type closed - orbit oscillations at small amplitudes and anharmonic closed - orbit oscillations at large amplitudes .",
    "the running phase trajectories consists of @xmath62 plateau connected by a population inversion occuring close to @xmath63 points .",

    "this is expected since the coupling parameter @xmath70 remains small . on the other hand , a surface - plasmon dominant initial population ( @xmath71 )",
    "is still effectively `` strong coupled '' since the coupling parameter can be close to unity even though @xmath51 is large ( see eq .",

    "[ fig:7](b ) ) , the asymmetry in @xmath36 induced by the dynamical coupling parameter is prominent . qualitatively speaking , the dwsp - jj acts like a double - well trap bjj system , where the barrier height ( i.e. the coupling ) between the two wells depends on the population of one well ( i.e. the soliton amplitude ) .",

    "in particular , the absorption loss of the surface - plasmon will be relevant and may alter the phase portrait substantially for strong loss .",
    "nevertheless , the qualitative features of the present analysis are still providing insight and reveal intriguing properties that can be observable under weak dissipative conditions .",
    "in this work , we proposed a weakly coupled optical - soliton and metal surface - plasmon system as a novel type of josephson junction and investigated its dynamical properties .",
    "we have found that the coupling parameter that depends on the soliton amplitude allows rich dynamical features , different than that observed in bosonic josephson junctions .",
