    "<S> using realistic wave functions , the proton - neutron and proton - proton momentum distributions in @xmath0 and @xmath1 are calculated as a function of the relative , @xmath2 , and center of mass , @xmath3 , momenta , and the angle between them . for large values of @xmath4 and small values of @xmath5 , both distributions are angle independent and decrease with increasing @xmath3 , with the @xmath6 distribution factorizing into the deuteron momentum distribution times a rapidly decreasing function of @xmath3 , in agreement with the two - nucleon ( 2n ) short range correlation ( src ) picture . when @xmath3 and @xmath2 are both large , the distributions exhibit a strong angle dependence , which is evidence of three - nucleon ( 3n ) src . </S>",
    "<S> the predicted center - of - mass and angular dependence of 2n and 3n src should be observable in two - nucleon knock - out processes @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> realistic many - body calculations ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite ) show that a mean field approach , though describing very successfully many properties of nuclei , breaks down when the relative distance @xmath8 between two generic nucleons `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' is of the order of @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> in this region nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) motion exhibits src , arising from the interplay between the short range repulsion and the intermediate range tensor attraction of the nn potential . as a result of such an interplay , </S>",
    "<S> the two - nucleon density distribution strongly deviates from the mean field distribution , in that whereas the latter has a maximum value at zero separation , the former almost vanishes at @xmath10 , increases sharply with increasing separation , overshoots at @xmath11 the mean field density , and coincides with it at larger separations . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed structure of src depends upon the spin - isospin state of the nn pair , as well as upon the value of the pair center - of - mass ( cm ) coordinate @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the study of src represents one of the main challenges of nowadays nuclear physics , since the detailed theoretical and experimental knowledge of the short range structure of nuclei , could provide decisive answers to longstanding fundamental questions , such as the formation and structure of cold dense nuclear matter , the origin of the emc effect , the role of quark - gluon degrees of freedom in nuclei ( see e.g. @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> src generate high momentum components , which are lacking in a mean field approach , and give rise to peculiar configurations of the nuclear wave function in momentum space @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , if nucleons `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' become strongly correlated at short distances , the local configuration ( in the nucleus cm frame ) characterized by @xmath13 , @xmath14 , dominates over the average mean field configuration @xmath15 , which is the configuration when the high momentum nucleon is balanced by all of the remaining @xmath16 nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if a correlated nucleon with momentum @xmath17 acquires a momentum @xmath18 from an external probe and it is removed from the nucleus and detected with momentum @xmath19 , the partner nucleon should be emitted with momentum @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> such a qualitative picture is strictly valid only if the cm momentum of the correlated pair was zero before nucleon removal and , moreover , if the two correlated nucleons leave the nucleus without interacting between themselves and with the nucleus @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , recent experimental data on nucleon knockout from carbon using protons @xcite , @xcite and electron @xcite projectiles , have shown that the removal of a proton from the nucleus in the range of @xmath22 is almost always accompanied by the emission of a neutron carrying momentum equal to @xmath23 , with a momentum spread in agreement with a gaussian motion of the cm of the correlated pair in the nucleus , as predicted long ago in ref . @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> whereas experiments demonstrating the presence of src in nuclei and their basic mechanism have eventually been performed , detailed information through the periodic table of their isospin , angular and cm dependencies is still to come . </S>",
    "<S> a partial relevant progress has however already been done by demonstrating @xcite , in qualitative agreement with the experimental data on @xmath24c , that the strong correlations induced by the tensor force lead to large differences in the @xmath25 and @xmath6 distributions at moderate values of the relative momentum of the pair . </S>",
    "<S> such a result has been confirmed in a recent thorough analysis @xcite of the relative ( integrated over the pair cm variables @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) two - body densities and momentum distributions , and their detailed dependence upon the spin - isospin states . </S>",
    "<S> as for the angular and cm dependencies of src , in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the focus was on the two - body momentum distributions integrated either over the cm or the relative momenta , whereas in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the cm dependence of the relative momentum distributions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 has been investigated in a particular angular configuration , namely when @xmath28 and @xmath29 are parallel . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> the results of calculations for arbitrary mutual orientations of @xmath28 and @xmath30 , are presented and several universal features of src will be demonstrated . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations were performed with nuclear wave functions @xcite obtained from the solution of the schrdinger equation containing realistic nn interactions , namely the @xmath31 @xcite and @xmath32 @xcite interactions . </S>",
    "<S> we will compare our results with a preliminary analysis of data on @xmath33he from the cebaf large acceptance spectrometer ( clas ) collaboration at jlab  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the summed over spin and isospin two body momentum distributions of a nucleon - nucleon pair is defined as follows    n^nn(_1,_2)= ddd^d^ e^i_1(_1-_1^ ) e^i_2(_2-_2^ ) ^(2)_nn(_1,_2;_1^,_2^ ) [ 2bmomdis ]    with    ^(2)_nn(_1,_2;_1^,_2^)=_m _ jm^*(r_1,r_2,r_3 ... </S>",

    "<S> given the formula above , the momentum distribution integrated over the cm coordinate , @xmath41 , and the one integrated over the relative momentum , @xmath42 , can be obtained , but a more important property , considered in this letter , is the dependence of the     and @xmath25 pairs in @xmath0 normalized to unity , _ vs. _ the relative momentum @xmath2 , for fixed values of the cm momentum @xmath3 and two orientations of them : @xmath43 ( _ broken curves _ ) and @xmath44 ( _ symbols _ ) . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite are reproduced , namely at small values of @xmath2 the @xmath6 and @xmath25 momentum distributions do not appreciably differ , with their ratio being closer to the ratio of the @xmath6 to @xmath25 pairs , whereas at @xmath63 the dominant role of tensor correlations makes the @xmath6 distributions much larger than @xmath25 distribution , with the node exhibited by the latter filled up by the @xmath64 wave in the @xmath6 two - body density ; ( ii ) @xmath65 , plotted _ vs. _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 , decreases with increasing values of @xmath3 ; ( iii ) starting from a given value of @xmath2 , which for @xmath46 is @xmath66 , and increases with increasing @xmath3 , the @xmath6 distribution changes its slope and becomes close to the deuteron distribution ; ( iv ) in the region ( @xmath67 ) , @xmath68 becomes @xmath39-independent , , which means that @xmath69 ; for @xmath6 pairs , one @xmath70 , where @xmath47 is the deuteron momentum distribution and the only a - dependence is given by @xmath71 ; the factorized form for @xmath6 pairs describes the 2n src configuration , when the relative momentum of the pair is much larger than the cm momentum ; ( v ) at high values of the cm momentum , of the same order of the ( large ) relative momentum , more than two particles can be locally correlated , with a resulting strong dependence upon the angle and the breaking down of factorization , as clearly shown by fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] for @xmath72 . according to our preliminary results @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> all of the above remarks appear to hold also for complex nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> let us now discuss in detail the factorized form of the momentum distributions for @xmath6 pairs . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we will consider the ratio @xmath73 and its isospin dependence , presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] , and the cm momentum distribution @xmath51 , presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> these two figures tell us , first of all , that the constant value exhibited by the @xmath48 , @xmath49 ratio at @xmath74 , is unquestionable evidence that in this region the dependence upon @xmath2 of the two body momentum distribution @xmath75 is the same as the deuteron one ; secondly , they also tell us that the difference between the ratios for @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the region @xmath76 equals exactly the difference between the values of the cm momentum distributions at @xmath46 , shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] ; as a consequence , if we divide the dotted lines by the corresponding values of @xmath77 , we obtain @xmath78 for both nuclei . concerning the different behavior of @xmath79 for @xmath0 and @xmath1 at @xmath80 , this is due to the different binding associated with the cm motion : in @xmath0 the third uncorrelated particle is weakly bound , with a long asymptotic tail , resulting in a sharp peak at @xmath46 ; thus the more rapid fall off of the cm momentum distributions of @xmath0 leads , with respect to the @xmath1 case , to the wider separation of the curves corresponding to various values of @xmath3 presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . in @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> the overall average density can already be described by a mean field approach , so that the realistic calculation leads , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] , to a result which is practically the same as the one obtained in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite within a model based upon the mean value of the kinetic energy in a shell model picture . as for the experimental ratio presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] , it should be pointed out that whereas this quantity represents a nice confirmation of the dominance of tensor correlations , it can not provide information about the increase or decrease of the two - body momentum distributions with the increase of the cm momentum , since the @xmath25 and @xmath6 distributions may both increase or decrease at the same time , leaving the ratio almost unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> a discriminating quantity would be the ratio of @xmath6 ( or @xmath25 ) pairs in correspondence of two values of the cm momentum . as a matter of fact </S>",
    "<S> , it can be seen from fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] that such a ratio at e.g. , @xmath46 and @xmath81 , is predicted to be a large positive number .    to sum up </S>",
    "<S> , a clear physical picture of the motion of a pair of nucleons embedded in the nuclear medium arises from our calculations . in the region </S>",
    "<S> @xmath82 , @xmath83 , the motion of @xmath84 pairs is governed by 2n src , characterized by a decoupling of the cm and relative motions ; for a @xmath6 pair , the latter is described by the deuteron momentum distribution and the former is governed by the average mean field motion . </S>",
    "<S> some aspects of this picture have already been experimentally confirmed @xcite , whereas some others , e.g. the cm dependence of two nucleon momentum distributions , need proper experimental investigations . </S>",
    "<S> this picture of a locally correlated pair , with the relative motion being practically a - independent , with the a - dependence given only by the cm motion , would be of great usefulness in various fields where src correlations have been recently shown to play an important role , such as high energy hadron - nucleus @xcite and nucleus - nucleus scattering @xcite , deep inelastic scattering @xcite , the equation of state of nuclear @xcite and neutron @xcite matters . </S>"
