    "are less settled .",
    "several predictions of continuum theories @xcite for time and wavelength dependence of the decay exist , where differences are mainly due to the different treatment of the singularity in the surface free energy that emerges for the orientation below the roughening temperature @xmath2 .",
    "experiments @xcite where surface diffusion prevails , show trapezoidal profiles with flat tops and bottoms , a feature qualitatively reproduced by several continuum approaches @xcite .",
    "simulations below @xmath2 are severely hampered by the slow decay kinetics , a problem somewhat less important for evaporation dynamics .",
    "furthermore for @xmath3 lattice effects play a role which are not present for @xmath4 and which are not taken into account in the continuum theory . to suppress these effects , larger systems need to be simulated .",
    "the scope of this article is to present new monte carlo simulations for the case of evaporation dynamics , which are able to test the predictions of continuum theory . in chapter",
    "ii we introduce a modified version of the hypercube stacking model @xcite for the case of a two dimensional surface . in chapter iii",
    "we recall the results of continuum theory for a bunch of straight steps and compare them to simulations at @xmath0 . in chapter",
    "iv we show how one can modify the continuum theory for periodic grooves to get agreement with our @xmath0 simulations and discuss another recent attempt to this problem . in chapter",
    "v we give a conclusion of our findings .",
    "appendix a briefly describes the core part of our modifications of the hypercube stacking model .",
    "we use the hypercube stacking model of forrest and tang , which is a solid on solid model of the @xmath5 surface of a simple cubic crystal as described in @xcite .",
    "originally blte and hilhorst @xcite considered an anti - ferromagnetic ising model on a triangular lattice with anisotropic couplings @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the limit @xmath9 .",
    "they noted already that in two dimensions each ising - spin configuration can be mapped on a sos height configuration . in the isotropic case @xmath10 considered in @xcite",
    "each configuration is a ground state of an anti ferromagnetic ising model with one frustrated bond per triangle and the corresponding sos model can be considered as temperature independent @xmath11 or as being at infinite temperature @xmath12 but @xmath13 .",
    "all possible surface configurations have the same energy , since the number of broken nearest neighbor bonds is conserved .",
    "dynamics can be imposed by assigning the same rate @xmath14 to all evaporation and condensation events allowed by the sos restriction .",
    "spin flips which maintain the condition of having one frustrated bond per triangle correspond to adding or removing an atom without violating the sos condition .",
    "+ we now introduce next - nearest - neighbor interactions of strength @xmath15 . if an atom is removed from the surface the surface energy changes by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the difference in the number of broken next - nearest - neighbor bonds and @xmath18 is the number of next - nearest - neighbors in the same layer .",
    "thus the total surface energy is proportional to the number of broken next - nearest - neighbor bonds .",
    "we impose the usual metropolis rates    @xmath19    with @xmath20 for an evaporation event and    @xmath21    for a condensation event .",
    "note that these rates fulfill detailed balance . + as shown in detail in @xcite the spin representation of the model can be programmed very efficiently by using a multi - site coding algorithm , where each spin is coded by a single bit of an integer variable and the dynamics is incorporated via logical operations on the integers . in this type of algorithm",
    "we can also incorporate the next - nearest - neighbor interactions between surface atoms as will be shown in some detail in appendix a. we use four dynamical sub - lattices as in @xcite for the evolution of the height profile .",
    "the active sub - lattice is chosen at random and each evaporation or condensation event on that sub - lattice allowed by the sos restriction takes place with the metropolis rate @xmath22 of the event determined by eqs .",
    "( [ 0a ] ) and ( [ 0b ] ) with @xmath23 .",
    "our generalization of the model of @xcite leads to a fast and memory saving implementation of a solid on solid model , which we use in the sequel to study the decay of surface corrugations consisting of many steps .",
    "we should note that , due to the multi - site coding , where we use each bit of a random number to update one spin , the values of @xmath24 , and therefore the available temperatures , are restricted to @xmath25 with @xmath26 integer and @xmath27 odd integer between @xmath28 and @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the best performance of the algorithm is achieved for small @xmath26 since @xmath30 random integers are needed for each update of the spins stored in one integer .",
    "the cases @xmath31 ( corresponding to @xmath0 and @xmath32 ) need only one random number per update for the rate @xmath23 while @xmath33 ( corresponding to @xmath34 ) needs already four , namely one for @xmath23 and three for @xmath35 .",
    "after completion of this work we became aware of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the same kind of model ( interpreted as a fcc crystal ) with different rates is studied for periodic grooves at a temperature @xmath36 ( corresponding to @xmath33 ) .",
    "+ in the sequel we concentrate on the case @xmath0 .",
    "then evaporation or condensation events can take place only at @xmath37 steps since adding or removing an atom there does not increase the number of broken bonds .",
    "decay kinetics is slowed down considerably by this choice , but as an advantage nucleation of islands or holes on terraces is entirely absent .",
    "this simplifies the comparison to continuum theory , since now the mobility of the surface is proportional to the kink density .",
    "the @xmath37 steps are rough even at @xmath0 due to the random update of growth and evaporation sites and the interaction between steps in this limit is purely entropic .",
    "we study the relaxation of two different initial profiles , a train of equidistant @xmath37 steps separating two plane @xmath5 surfaces ( step geometry ) and a periodic sinusoidal corrugation of wavelength @xmath38 .",
    "for the second we grow an initial profile that satisfies @xmath39 ( where @xmath40 denotes the integer part of the argument ) on a flat surface of size @xmath41 so that the steps of the profile do have @xmath37 orientation . for the original model which is effectively at @xmath32 we recover the well known results of mullins @xcite valid above the roughening transition .",
    "to describe the flattening of a profile under evaporation dynamics with a continuum theory we use the usual assumption that the profile evolution minimizes the free energy of the surface in the most direct way : @xmath42 here @xmath43 is the mobility of a surface of slope @xmath44 and the free energy @xmath45 of the surface is given by the integral over the free energy @xmath46 per unit projected surface area .",
    "below the roughening transition @xmath46 is written as @xcite @xmath47 with @xmath48 for purely entropic step repulsion .",
    "@xmath49 describes the energy of the @xmath5 surface , @xmath50 is the step free energy which contributes proportional to the step density @xmath51 and the @xmath52 term describes step step interactions . now",
    "the wedge singularity of the @xmath50 term at @xmath53 leads to a @xmath54-function singularity in ( [ 1 ] ) . in the case of evaporation dynamics well below @xmath2 , where thermally activated nucleation is negligible and",
    "the whole dynamics is due to step motion , the mobility of a surface is proportional to the step density @xcite @xmath55 since nucleation is an activated process , it is entirely absent in our @xmath0 simulations and eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) is valid even for a driven surface . now",
    "the vanishing mobility at @xmath53 for the high symmetry orientation cancels the @xmath54-function singularity in ( [ 1 ] ) leading to @xcite @xmath56 for the step geometry @xcite the scaling ansatz @xmath57 gives @xmath58 and leads to a barenblatt solution @xcite for the slope @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are constants determined by the initial condition and @xmath63 denotes the positive part of the bracket . since eq .",

    "the topmost curves are data for 45 steps on a @xmath77 lattice up to @xmath70 with @xmath78 , averaged over 100 independent runs .",
    "the middle set gives the same information for 22 steps on a @xmath79 lattice with @xmath71 averaged over @xmath80 runs and the lowest set are the differentiated data of figure 1 .",
    "the curves of figure 2 nicely approach the ellipses of the barenblatt solution ( [ 5 ] ) and a good fit can be achieved with @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( from top to bottom ) in agreement with @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the slight skewness in the initial condition ( due to computational convenience ) vanishes in course of time , indicating that the barenblatt solution is attractive also for asymmetric initial profiles .",
    "the singularity of eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) for @xmath53 is smeared out by the fluctuations of the rightmost and leftmost steps .",
    "furthermore one can resolve the mean positions of the individual steps , as is seen best for the 11 step data .",
    "similar features have been observed recently @xcite for two steps with surface diffusion dynamics .",
    "for periodic surface grooves eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) leads to a solution that predicts a non parabolic sharpening of the profile tips proportional to @xmath85 @xcite that was observed neither in previous @xcite nor in the present simulations .",
    "as pointed out by rettori and villain @xcite the decay of the profile tips proceeds via the shrinking of islands formed by the two topmost meandering steps , which annihilate each other on contact .",
    "this process induces a nonzero mean kink density at the tips of the profile and hence the mobility does not vanish for @xmath53 . in this case",
    "we expect the wedge singularity of eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) to be rounded to an analytical function with nonzero @xmath86 .",

    "provided that @xmath43 contains no @xmath38 dependence eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) is independent under the rescaling @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "thus the data for a set of initial profiles with the same slope but different wavelengths @xmath38 should collapse on a single scaling curve under the rescaling .",
    "note that the first two terms in ( [ 6 ] ) are positive while the third one is negative . in the sequel we restrict the discussion to the interval",

    "( [ 3 ] ) is valid and the third term dominates , the first term is of the same magnitude as the second . by neglecting the first term in eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) we get @xmath97 now the singularity in the free energy is not canceled by a vanishing mobility and gives rise to a @xmath98 function in @xmath99 .",
    "bonzel and preuss @xcite smoothened the wedge singularity and solved the resulting eq .  numerically in the case of surface diffusion .",
    "this leads to qualitatively correct results but introduces additional parameters . as required by the thermodynamic stability of neighboring surface orientations with @xmath100 , @xmath89 is strictly increasing and therefore invertible .",
    "so we can transform the singular eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) into a well defined free boundary problem @xcite by using @xmath101 instead of @xmath66 as the independent variable .",
