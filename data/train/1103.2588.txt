    "to obtain a detailed physical understanding of the events that shaped the galactic disc , we must examine its individual stars .",
    "the chemical abundances as measured from stellar photospheres can be indicative of the conditions of a star s birth site .",
    "different chemical elements are synthesized during different stages of stellar evolution and distributed to the interstellar medium via supernova explosions or stellar winds . by studying the abundances of these elements we can estimate the frequency and importance of each synthesis process .",
    "therefore the chemical abundance patterns within the disc stars can be regarded as a fossil imprint and hold key information of the events that took place during the disc s formation and evolutionary history .",
    "the long term goal of galactic archaeology is to reconstruct the original star - forming events of the galaxy . employing the technique of chemical tagging @xcite to disc stars ,",
    "one can identify now dispersed ancient stellar aggregates , the building blocks of the galactic disc .",
    "+ candidates for such fossil stellar aggregates are moving groups and superclusters , where their stellar members are unbound but share a common motion around the galaxy .",
    "analogous to stellar streams in the galaxy halo which are remnants of merged satellites , old moving groups and superclusters may represent the ancient stellar building blocks of the disc .",
    "a strong advocate for the reality of these groups was olin eggen , who identified several moving groups and superclusters ( eggen 1958  1998 ) . with the availability of the hipparcos catalogue of parallaxes and proper motions it became possible to study these substructures in unprecedented detail .",
    "several studies have analysed the hipparcos catalogue and re - identified the classical groups as well as found new ones @xcite .",
    "essentially , all of these studies have focused purely on the dynamical / kinematical nature of the substructures in the disc .",
    "+ thus moving groups and superclusters provide disc substructures that can be identified through kinematics . however , it is not yet clear if all , or indeed the majority , of these substructures actually originate from star forming clusters that have or are in the process of being dispersed .",
    "such substructures can equally well be the result of the dynamical interaction between the stars in the field and the central bar or the spiral structure of the milky way .",
    "therefore not all kinematically defined disc substructures represent the debris of a single star formation event .      the existence of a dispersed kinematically defined group of stars associated with the hyades open cluster was proposed by @xcite , as part of a larger star - forming event , where the outer cluster stars have dispersed into the hyades supercluster , leaving only its core members in the present day hyades open cluster . the existence of the kinematically defined hyades supercluster is well established observationally ( e.g. in hipparcos , rave and geneva - copenhagen survey ) , where a concentration of stars are found at u @xmath0 -40  and v @xmath0 -20  in the @xmath1 velocity plane",
    "throughout this article we adopt the direction of the u - velocity as positive towards the galactic centre . however , many studies suggest that this over density of stars consists of a mixture of field stars that have been resonantly swept up by a passing spiral wave and is not the results of a dispersed stellar aggregate @xcite .",
    "+ with kinematical information alone it is difficult to address the reality of dispersed stellar aggregates .",
    "the dissipative formation and dynamical evolution of the galaxy means much of the kinematical information is limited to the last event of scattering , where the original kinematical information has been modified as a result of latter events .",
    "therefore only the most recent events can be traced with kinematics , masking the initial identity .",
    "however the chemical information in the form of elemental abundances of individual stars remains preserved .",
    "present day open clusters are chemically homogeneous @xcite , which demonstrates that the stars natal chemical composition is unaltered .",
    "therefore , along with kinematical information , chemical probing of moving groups and superclusters offers the possibility to determine their initial identity .",
    "detailed abundance study of the hr1614 moving group @xcite demonstrated its member stars are chemically homogeneous and clearly distinguishable from the disc field stars , indicating that it is a dispersed relic of an earlier star - forming event ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* for the case of wolf 630 moving group ) .",
    "conversely , an example of a dynamically defined group is the hercules stream , which is not chemically homogeneous and its abundance patterns are not distinguishable from the field stars @xcite .",
    "when inspected in velocity space alone , both the hr1614 moving group and the hercules stream satisfy the requirements for a dispersing cluster remnant , while chemical probing shows that they have very different origins .",
    "these examples demonstrate that chemical information is essential to identify dispersed group members , and that dynamical information alone can not be used to uncover the true history behind any co - moving group of stars in the disc . + despite the wealth of information obtainable via chemical probing , elemental abundance analysis of the kinematically defined moving groups are lacking in the literature , possibly due to the larger effort required to measure accurate abundances . in this paper",
    "we present high resolution elemental abundances for a sample of proposed hyades supercluster stars and examine its possible origins .",
    "assuming that the hyades supercluster is part of larger structure produced by a dissolving star formation site , we can expect that the site would dissolve along a dispersion orbit .",
    "these paths along which a gently disrupting system would dissolve , can be approximated by closed ellipses when viewed from a frame rotating at the local value of @xmath2 - @xmath3 where @xmath2 is the local angular velocity of rotation near the sun and @xmath4 is the epicyclic frequency .",
    "the stars move clockwise around these ellipses with angular velocity approximately @xmath3 and gradually spread out around them . in this work ,",
    "the adopted velocity of hyades supercluster stars near the sun was u = -40 , v = -17 consistent with the currently accepted motion of the hyades open cluster and the corresponding over - density regions seen in the geneva - copenhagen survey .",
    "+ @xcite observed low latitude k giant stars from the michigan catalogue @xcite in the expected direction of the hyades supercluster dispersion orbit .",
    "the observations were carried out using the coude spectrograph on the mt stromlo observatory 74inch telescope . the data of r @xmath0 20,000 centred at 5200@xmath5 were cross - correlated against template spectra to derive metallicities and radial velocities .",
    "wilson found a concentration of stars in the abundance range -0.2 to -0.1 lying close to the hyades dispersion orbit loci in the radial velocity - longitude plane , which he interpreted as being stars associated with the dispersing hyades systems . the currently accepted hyades open cluster metallicity is [ fe / h ] = + 0.13 dex based on high resolution abundances @xcite . while we can not accurately compare high resolution fe abundances with the early metallicity derivations due to likely zero - point offsets",
    ", it is interesting that a concentration of stars was found along the dispersion orbits in this metallicity bin . + we selected stars likely to be dispersing hyades supercluster stars based on wilson s results for high resolution observations .",
    "our analysis will test the hypothesis of the disrupting system discussed above .",
    "we also targeted f - type probable member stars as published in @xcite , which had hipparcos identification .",
    "table [ sample ] lists the ids , co - ordinates , v magnitude and colour for all observed stars . in the last column of table [ sample ]",
    ", e98 indicates stars selected from @xcite and w indicates those selected from wilson s thesis . +    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we obtained high resolution spectra of 45 proposed hyades supercluster members , which were selected based on early estimates of the targets metallicity and position along the expected dispersion orbit of the hyades supercluster , as well as f - type hipparcos stars from @xcite .",
    "the observing results showed that only 26 stars were suitable for detailed abundance analysis .",
    "the abundance distribution showed a double - peaked distribution , with two clear clustering of stars around solar metallicity and around hyades open cluster metallicity .",
    "+ four of the stars with hyades open cluster metallicity also shared similar abundance patterns , with the star - to - star scatter within 0.05 across all elements except for na , s , sc , co , zn and zr .",
    "possible deviations due to stellar evolutionary effects as well as larger abundance uncertainty in this analysis make these six elements less reliable for chemical tagging than the other elements analysed in this study .",
    "further , the four stars abundances for ba , la and ce match the abundances observed in the hyades open cluster .",
    "these heavy elements are produced predominately via the slow neutron capture process , where the likely sites of formation are type ii supernova explosion .",
    "therefore the heavy element abundances are not modified during the lifetime of the giant and sub - giant stars we have studied , and the measured abundances should represent the abundance levels laid out during the stars birth in a proto - cluster cloud . + examining the space velocities of our targets revealed that our sample stars are within @xmath6 20  of the hyades open cluster v velocity .",
    "those velocity outliers are most likely to be non - members of the kinematically defined hyades supercluster . applying both kinematical and chemical criteria , we find four stars are likely dispersed members from an earlier hyades star - forming event .",
    "these four stars share hyades - like kinematics and chemical abundances , but spatially they are located away from the hyades open cluster",
    ". therefore these four stars are clearly supercluster members , rather than open cluster members . the rest of the stars are either non - members of the supercluster , or they are kinematically members of a co - moving group , but are otherwise unrelated to the hyades star - forming event .",
    "+ the presented results are primarily a test of the hyades cluster disruption hypothesis of @xcite .",
    "we find @xmath015% of his sample are supercluster members based on kinematics and chemical abundances .",
    "our study only included one slow rotating star from @xcite , hence we are unable to test the validity of his sample . from our results , we conclude that the kinematically defined hyades supercluster is made up at least partly of dispersed hyades cluster stars",
    ". further study of the hyades supercluster , especially targeting kinematically defined dwarf stellar members is encouraged .",
    "gds would like to thank f. primas for the use of the stellar parameters for the hyades open cluster dwarfs based on a new hyades open cluster abundance analysis in preparation ."
