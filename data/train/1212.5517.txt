    "many markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods are based on the metropolis ",

    "let us recall this well - known sampling technique .",
    "let us consider a target probability distribution on @xmath5 with density  @xmath6 .",
    "starting from an initial random variable @xmath7 , the metropolis ",
    "hastings algorithm generates iteratively a markov chain @xmath8 in two steps . at time @xmath9 ,",
    "given @xmath10 , a candidate @xmath11 is sampled using a proposal distribution with density @xmath12 .",
    "then , the proposal @xmath11 is accepted with probability @xmath13 , where @xmath14 here and in the following , we use the standard notation @xmath15 . if the proposed value is accepted , then @xmath16 otherwise @xmath17 .",
    "the markov chain @xmath8 is by construction reversible with respect to the target density @xmath6 , and thus admits @xmath6 as an invariant distribution .",
    "the efficiency of this algorithm highly depends on the choice of the proposal distribution @xmath18 .",
    "one common choice is a gaussian proposal centered at point @xmath19 with variance @xmath20 : @xmath21 since the proposal is symmetric ( @xmath22 ) , the acceptance probability reduces to @xmath23 metropolis  hastings algorithms with symmetric kernels are called random walk metropolis ( rwm ) .",
    "another popular choice yields the so called metropolis adjusted langevin algorithm ( mala ) . in this case , the proposal distribution is a gaussian random variable with variance @xmath20 and centered at point @xmath24 ( in particular , it is not symmetric )",
    ". it corresponds to one step of a time - discretization with timestep @xmath25 of the ( overdamped ) langevin dynamics : @xmath26 which is ergodic with respect to @xmath27 ( here , @xmath28 is a standard @xmath1-dimensional brownian motion ) .    in both cases ( rwm and mala ) ,",
    "the variance @xmath25 remains to be chosen .",
    "it should be sufficiently large to ensure a good exploration of the state space , but not too large otherwise the rejection rate becomes typically very high since the proposed moves fall in low probability regions , in particular in high dimension .",
    "it is expected that the higher the dimension , the smaller the variance of the proposal should be .",
    "the first theoretical results to optimize the choice of @xmath25 in terms of the dimension @xmath1 can be found in @xcite .",
    "the authors study the rwm algorithm under two fundamental ( and somewhat restrictive ) assumptions : ( i ) the target probability distribution is the @xmath1-fold tensor product of a one - dimensional density : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 , and ( ii ) the initial distribution is the target probability ( what we refer to as _ the stationarity assumption _ in the following ) : @xmath32 the superscript @xmath1 in the markov chain @xmath33 explicitly indicates the dependency on the dimension @xmath1 .",
    "then , under additional regularity assumption on @xmath34 , the authors prove that for a proper scaling of the variance as a function of the dimension , namely @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a fixed constant , the markov process @xmath37 ( where @xmath38 denotes the first component of @xmath39 ) converges in law to a diffusion process : @xmath40 where @xmath41 here and in the following , @xmath42 denotes the integer part ( for @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) and @xmath46 is the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "the scalings of the variance and of the time as a function of the dimension are indications on how to make the rwm algorithm efficient in high dimension .",
    "moreover , a practical counterpart of this result is that @xmath36 should be chosen such that @xmath48 is maximum ( the optimal value of @xmath36 is @xmath49 with @xmath50 ) , in order to optimize the time scaling in  ( [ eq : cas_eq ] ) .",
    "this optimal value of @xmath36 corresponds equivalently to a constant average acceptance rate , with approximate value @xmath51 : for this choice of @xmath36 , in the limit @xmath1 large , @xmath52 notice that the optimal average acceptance rate does not depend on @xmath53 , and is thus the same whatever the target probability .",
    "thus , the practical way to choose @xmath25 is to scale it in such a way that the average acceptance rate is roughly @xmath3 .",
    "similar results have been obtained for the mala algorithm in @xcite . in this case , the scaling for the variance is @xmath54 , the time scaling is @xmath55 and the optimal average acceptance rate is @xmath56 .",
    "there exists several extensions of such results for various metropolis ",
    "hastings algorithms , see @xcite , and some of them relax in particular the first main assumption mentioned above about the separated form of the target distribution , see @xcite .",
    "extensions to infinite dimensional settings have also been explored , see @xcite .",
    "all these results assume stationarity : the initial measure is the target probability . to the best of the authors knowledge , the only works which deal with a nonstationary case are @xcite where the rwm and the mala algorithms are analyzed in the gaussian case and @xcite . in the latter paper , the target measure",
    "is assumed to be absolutely continuous with respect to the law of an infinite dimensional gaussian random field and this measure is approximated in a space of dimension @xmath1 where the mcmc algorithm is performed .",
    "the authors consider a modified rwm algorithm ( called preconditioned crank  nicolson walk ) started at a deterministic initial condition and prove that when @xmath57 tends to @xmath58 as @xmath1 tends to @xmath59 ( with no restriction on the rate of convergence of @xmath57 to @xmath58 ) , the rescaled algorithm converges to a stochastic partial differential equation , started at the same initial condition .",
    "the aim of this article is to discuss extensions of the previous results for the rwm and the mala algorithms , _ without assuming stationarity_. the main findings are the following .    concerning the rwm algorithm , in the companion paper @xcite , we prove that , using the same scaling for the variance and the time as in the stationary case ( namely @xmath60 and considering @xmath61 ) , one obtains in the limit @xmath1 goes to infinity a diffusion process nonlinear in the sense of mckean ( see equation ( [ edsnonlin ] ) below ) .",
    "this is discussed in section  [ sec : rwm ] .",
    "contrary to ( [ eq : cas_eq ] ) , this diffusion process can not be obtained from the simple langevin dynamics @xmath62 by a deterministic time - change and its long - time behavior is not obvious . in section  [ sec : rwm_longtime ] , we first prove that its unique stationary distribution is @xmath63 . assuming that this measure satisfies a logarithmic sobolev inequality , we prove that the kullback ",
    "leibler divergence of the marginal distribution at time @xmath64 with respect to @xmath63 converges to @xmath58 at an exponential rate . in section  [ sec : optim_rwm ] , we discuss optimizing strategies which take into account the transient phase . roughly speaking , the usual strategy which consists in choosing @xmath36 ( recall that @xmath60 ) such that the average acceptance rate is constant ( with value between @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) seems to be a very good strategy .",
    "this is numerically illustrated in section  [ sec : numerics ] .",
    "concerning the mala algorithm , the situation is much more complicated .",
    "the scaling to be used seems to depend on the sign of an average quantity ( see section  [ sec : mala_practice ] ) .",
    "in particular , the scaling @xmath54 which has been identified in @xcite under the stationary assumption is not adapted to the transient phase .",
    "it seems difficult to draw any practical recommendation from this analysis .",
    "this is explained with details in section  [ sec : mala ] .",
    "in this section , we state the diffusion limit for the rwm algorithm , and explain formally why this result holds . a rigorous proof can be found in @xcite .",
    "we consider a random walk metropolis algorithm using gaussian proposal with variance @xmath60 , and with target @xmath6 defined by ( [ eq : pi ] ) .",
    "the markov chain generated using this algorithm writes : @xmath65 with @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a sequence of independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) normal random variables independent from a sequence @xmath68 of i.i.d .",
    "random variables with uniform law on @xmath69 $ ] .",
    "we assume that the initial positions @xmath70 are exchangeable ( namely the law of the vector is invariant under permutation of the indices ) and independent from all the previous random variables .",
    "exchangeability is preserved by the dynamics : for all @xmath71 , @xmath72 are exchangeable .",

    "let @xmath77 be the linear interpolation of the markov chain obtained by rescaling time ( the characteristic time scale is @xmath78 ) .",
    "this is the classical diffusive time - scale for a random walk , since the variance of each move is of order @xmath78 .",
    "let us define the notion of convergence ( namely the propagation of chaos ) that will be useful to study the convergence of the interacting particle system @xmath79 in the limit @xmath1 goes to infinity .",
    "let @xmath80 be a separable metric space .",

    "let us now present formally how ( [ edsnonlin ] ) is derived .",
    "first , let us explain how the scaling of @xmath57 as a function of @xmath1 is chosen .",
    "the idea ( see @xcite ) is to choose @xmath57 in such a way that the limiting acceptance rate ( when @xmath2 ) is neither zero nor one . in the first case",
    ", this would mean that the variance of the proposal is too large , so that all proposed moves are rejected . in the second case ,",
    "the variance of the proposal is too small , and the rate of convergence to equilibrium is thus not optimal . in particular , it is easy to check that @xmath57 should go to zero as @xmath1 goes to infinity .",
    "now , notice that the limiting acceptance rate is : @xmath135 where @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "the formula ( [ eq : accept_rwm ] ) is obtained by explicit computations ( see @xcite , proposition  2.4 ) . from this expression , assuming a propagation of chaos ( law of large numbers ) on the random variables @xmath138 , one can check that the correct scaling for the variance is @xmath60 in order to obtain a nontrivial limiting acceptance rate ( see @xcite , section  2.3 ) .    using this scaling",
    ", we observe that , for a test function @xmath139 , @xmath140 we compute ( by conditioning with respect to @xmath141 ) : @xmath142 where @xmath143 denotes the empirical distribution associated to the interacting particle system .",
    "the equation ( [ eq : drift ] ) is again a consequence of explicit computations ( see @xcite , equation ( a.3 ) ) , and the fact that the remainder is of order @xmath144 requires a detailed analysis ( see @xcite , proposition  7 ) .",
    "likewise , for the diffusion term , we get @xmath145 to obtain ( [ eq : diff ] ) , we again used an explicit computation ( see @xcite , equation ( a.5 ) ) .    by plugging ( [ eq : drift ] ) and ( [ eq : diff ] ) into ( [ eq : gen_inf ] )",
    ", we see that the correct scaling in time is to consider @xmath146 such that @xmath147 ( diffusive timescale ) , and we get : @xmath148 where @xmath123 is defined by ( [ deflmu ] ) .",
    "this can be seen as a discrete - in - time version ( over a timestep of size @xmath78 ) of the martingale property ( [ eq : martingale ] ) .",
    "thus , by sending @xmath1 to infinity , assuming that @xmath149 converges to the law of @xmath150 , we expect @xmath151 to converge to a solution to ( [ edsnonlin ] ) . for a rigorous proof , we refer to @xcite .",

    "hence , @xmath175 is a stationary probability distribution for the stochastic differential equation ( [ edsnonlin ] ) .",
    "let us now prove the uniqueness of the invariant measure .",

    "assume @xmath177 .",
    "since @xmath178 and @xmath179 , the stochastic differential equation ( [ edsnonlin ] ) with @xmath7 distributed according to the density @xmath176 reduces in this case to @xmath180 which does not admit a stationary distribution .",
