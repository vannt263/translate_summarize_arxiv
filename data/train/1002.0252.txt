    "quantum spin chains play a fundamental role in the study of many - body systems and quantum phase transitions .",
    "these phenomena take place at zero temperature , that is in a purely quantum regime , and are induced by the variation of an internal parameter causing a critical change in the ground state due to level crossing in the energy spectrum @xcite . in recent years , a renewed interest in quantum phase transitions has been developed to understand the behavior of entanglement near the critical point @xcite .",
    "on the contrary , the study of interactions between spins and light is considered as the starting point to introduce the framework of open systems , where the appearance of dissipation and decoherence can be understood @xcite .",
    "a prototypical example is the so - called spin - boson model @xcite , consisting of a single spin interacting with a multimode electromagnetic radiation , modeled as distribution of quantum harmonic oscillators . here",
    ", we discuss the case where a series of spins ( arranged in an isotropic @xmath0 chain ) interacts with one or more bosonic modes .    despite the importance of spin systems",
    ", they are not always directly accessible experimentally , and efficient experimental quantum simulation methods are needed to study their properties .",
    "it has been shown that spin chains can be efficiently simulated using internal and external degrees of freedom of trapped particles @xcite .",
    "in particular , arrays of laser - cooled trapped ions seem to be very promising from an experimental point of view .",
    "ions can be trapped with high spatial accuracy , and their internal states can be manipulated with high precision by means of the interaction with electromagnetic fields .",
    "the first experimental evidence of coupling between two - level systems , consisting in the transition from paramagnetic to ferromagnetic order in a two - spin quantum ising model has recently been reported @xcite .",
    "furthermore , ion traps offer the possibility of engineering spin - boson coupling @xcite . since spin chains are also important for practical applications , like quantum communication protocols @xcite , their simulation would allow estimation of the decoherence effects which derive from the interaction with the environment @xcite .",
    "as said before , we propose a model which allows to observe the phase transition in an isotropic @xmath0 spin chain coupled with external boson modes .",
    "the model we introduce in the following is exactly solvable .",
    "the phase transition manifests itself in a nonanalytical variation of the amplitude of the bosonic field . in correspondence of this change ,",
    "the chain acquires a finite magnetization .",
    "the physical implementation of this model can be done within the framework of trapped ions discussed before .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ ii ] we first introduce the general argument of simulation of spin chains with trapped ions .",
    "then , we show how it is possible to simulate a particular model , consisting of a chain of spins in contact with a bosonic environment .",
    "the critical properties at zero temperature of this model are discussed in sec .",
    "[ iii ] , while in sec .",
    "[ iv ] we study the phase diagram at finite temperature in the case of a single slowly oscillating phonon . finally , in sec .",
    "[ v ] we present our conclusions .",
    "as shown in refs . @xcite and @xcite , coulomb chains in linear paul traps can simulate spin - spin interactions .",
    "an effective spin - spin hamiltonian emerges as the result of the interaction of the internal ( electronic ) states of ions with the phononic degrees of freedom generated by coulomb repulsion .",
    "the total hamiltonian includes a phonon bath ( @xmath1 ) , a state - dependent force produced by a set of lasers along the directions @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , and an effective magnetic field that can be generated by forcing transitions between the internal ion states ( @xmath4 ) . in units of @xmath5 ,",
    "we have ( see @xcite ) @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the annihilation operator of the @xmath8 vibrational mode in the @xmath9 direction of the phonon bath due to the coulomb repulsion , @xmath10 are the laser forces , @xmath11 is the displacement , with respect to its equilibrium position , of ion @xmath12 in direction @xmath9 , and @xmath13 is the effective magnetic field . expressing the coordinates in terms of collective modes through the matrices @xmath14 , @xmath15 a spin - spin hamiltonian is obtained after the application of a suitable canonical transformation @xmath16 , introduced to eliminate @xmath3 : if @xmath17 the total system hamiltonian turns out to be @xmath18 where @xmath19 , the coupling parameters @xmath20 are function of @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is a residual term that can be neglected at low temperatures or by using highly anisotropic traps @xcite . a particular case of eq . ( [ eqn : heff ] ) is represented by the isotropic @xmath0 chain in the presence of a transverse field , numerically studied in ref . @xcite .    here",
    ", we show that a different interpretation of the unitary transformation allows us to obtain other kinds of phase transitions , involving , for instance , the interaction between spins and bosons . a possible way to do that consists in applying different transformations along the three axes .",
    "in fact , by limiting the transformation given before to the directions @xmath23 and @xmath24 , through @xmath25 we obtain @xmath26 here , the correction @xmath27 can be neglected in the same limit of @xmath22 . in the case of a spatially homogeneous array ,",
    "we can drop the dependence from the ion position in both @xmath28 and in @xmath20 . moreover , if the coulomb interaction can be considered as a perturbation with respect to the trapping potential ( stiff limit ) , the trapping frequencies can be tuned to obtain relevant spin - spin coupling only between nearest neighbors @xcite . along the transverse direction , a boson displacement can be applied to eliminate the term @xmath29 . as a result ,",
    "@xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "the last term is a constant that translates all the energies , and the fields @xmath32 can be set to zero . by fixing the external magnetic field @xmath33",
    ", we arrive to @xmath34 it is worth noting that , since the mutual distance between the ions makes any direct spin - spin interaction negligible , the spins we introduced are effective two - level systems that , because of the unitary transformation , are not trivially related to the original internal degrees of freedom of the ions .",
    "nevertheless , the bosonic variables do refer to the real phonon modes along the @xmath35 direction , so their measurement appears to be the natural way to get information about the overall system .",
    "to describe the critical properties of this model , let us first discuss the simpler single - mode version . by assuming @xmath36 , the hamiltonian is @xmath37+\\omega   a^{\\dag}a+\\frac{g}{\\sqrt{n}}(a^{\\dag}+a)\\sum_{l=1}^n\\sigma_{l}^{z},\\label{acca}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the total number of spin , and where periodic boundary conditions are imposed .",
    "as it is useful to work with adimensional quantities , we use @xmath20 as energy unit and define the rescaled phonon frequency @xmath39 as well as the bare coupling constant @xmath40 . using this notation",
    "the hamiltonian reads @xmath41+\\gamma   a^{\\dag}a+\\sqrt { \\frac{\\lambda \\gamma } { n}}(a^{\\dag}+a)\\sum_{l=1}^n\\sigma_{l}^{z}.\\label{acca_ad}\\ ] ] to diagonalize it , first we introduce the jordan - wigner transformation @xcite , defined by @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , mapping spins into spinless fermions . then , the fourier transform @xmath45 allows us to write , in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "fermions can be decoupled from the bosonic degree of freedom by applying the displacement operator @xmath48}$ ] such that @xmath49 , @xmath50 being an operator in the fermionic space . since @xmath51=0 $ ] , fermions are not transformed into polarons because of the application of @xmath52 .",
    "moreover , it is immediately seen that @xmath53=1 $ ] .",
    "this displacement replaces the boson vacuum with a coherent state whose amplitude is determined by the transverse component of the total spin .",
    "the final hamiltonian is @xmath54^{2}. \\label{hd}\\ ] ] adding the boson displacement @xmath52 to @xmath55 and @xmath56 of sec .",
    "[ ii ] amounts to building the total @xmath57 of ref .",
    "@xcite for a particular choice of parameters .",
    "if one disregards the term @xmath58 , the hamiltonian [ hd ] can now be interpreted as a @xmath59 spin chain with short - range coupling along the radial direction and axial long - range coupling .",
    "these kinds of interaction ranges are realistic , since radial modes can mediate nearest - neighbor spin - spin interactions ( stiff limit ) , and transverse modes are known to generate long - range interactions ( soft limit ) . while the range of interactions along the transverse direction depends only on the number of ions and",
    "can not be manipulated by means of laser fields , the stiff limit in the radial direction can be reached by increasing the trapping frequencies @xcite .",
    "performing the unitary transformations in two separate steps helped us to interpret this model in terms of the coupling with a real phonon . without performing the two steps separately",
    ", we could not discuss the spin - boson phase transition .    at first sight",
    ", @xmath60 is similar to that of the @xmath61 chain in a transverse field @xcite , whose hamiltonian in the jordan - wigner space would be @xmath62 .",
    "while the latter model has the @xmath63 symmetry , since it is invariant under rotations around the @xmath35 axis , the hamiltonian ( [ acca ] ) has an additional symmetry , also being invariant under the action of the operator @xmath64}$ ] .",
    "the @xmath63 symmetry implies , in the language of fermions , that eigenstates of @xmath65 have a fixed number of particles .",
    "the symmetry @xmath66 could be broken , for instance , by adding a displacing bosonic field , @xmath67 , and then sending it to @xmath68 .",
    "the average value of @xmath67 can be assumed as an order parameter to study the breakdown of @xmath66 .",
    "since we are interested in the implementation in an array of ion traps , finite - size effects should be taken into account .",
    "a detailed analysis of @xmath69 models in finite cycles has been made in several papers @xcite . in our model , after the jordan - wigner transformation , the hamiltonian becomes @xmath70 where @xmath38 is assumed to be an even number and where @xmath71 .",
    "its possible eigenvalues are @xmath72 .",
    "note that @xmath73 is a measure of the parity of the number of particles of each state .",
    "since @xmath74=0 $ ] , all eigenstates of @xmath75 have definite parity , and we can proceed to a separate diagonalization of @xmath75 in the two subspaces corresponding to @xmath76 . then ,",
    "if we introduce the two new hamiltonians @xmath77 , the complete set of eigenvectors of @xmath75 will be given by the odd eigenstates of @xmath78 and the even eigenstates of @xmath79 .",
    "the choice of @xmath80 or @xmath81 amounts to having , respectively , periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions .",
    "this implies that @xmath79 and @xmath78 are diagonalized through two fourier transforms which differ from each other because of the set of allowed values of @xmath82 .",
    "if half - integer values ( @xmath83 ) are used to diagonalize @xmath79 , in the case of @xmath78 we have @xmath84 .",
    "now , the displacement operator @xmath52 can be introduced , and a structure formally identical to that given in eq .",
    "( [ hd ] ) can be done for both @xmath79 and @xmath78 , with the proper choice of @xmath82 .",
    "the ground state of the bosonic part can be identified as the vacuum state of the operator @xmath85 , and it corresponds , in the original representation , to a coherent state of amplitude equal to the average value of the operator @xmath86 calculated on the fermionic ground state , whose structure is now enlightened .",
    "since both @xmath79 and @xmath78 are exactly solvable , their spectra can be calculated by measuring the energy of all possible configurations , obtained adding the desired number of fermions .",
    "the energy of a state with @xmath87 particles is @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a string representing the occupation of different modes .",
    "the sum is extended only to the values of @xmath82 where a particle is present . for large values of @xmath90 ,",
    "the first term will be larger than the sum , unless @xmath91 is very small .",
    "the ground state corresponds to the sequences which maximize @xmath92 , that is , to @xmath93 or @xmath94 , and it is twofold degenerate . in fact , both the state @xmath95 and the state @xmath96 have energy equal to @xmath97 . here",
    "the state @xmath98 is , in the original fermion - boson representation ( before the application of @xmath52 ) , the tensor product of the fermionic vacuum and of a coherent bosonic state of amplitude @xmath99 , while in @xmath100 the fermionic system is fully occupied , and the boson coherent state has amplitude @xmath101 .",
    "as @xmath90 decreases , the two terms in eq .",
    "( [ mm ] ) start to compete with each other .",
    "let us call @xmath102 the value such that @xmath103 .",
    "since , by symmetry , @xmath104 , we limit out consideration @xmath105 . it can be shown that , if @xmath106 , then @xmath107 .",
    "in other words , the first ground - state level crossing takes place between @xmath98 ( or @xmath100 ) and a state with @xmath108 particles .",
    "this transition occurs at the value of @xmath109 determined by @xmath110 in the thermodynamic limit , performed replacing the sum with an integral , we obtain @xmath111 . as a consequence of the half - filling , @xmath112 , and the boson part is left in its vacuum .",
    "this state can be written as @xmath113 .    by further decreasing @xmath90 , no other transitions are observed .",
    "then the state @xmath114 is the hamiltonian ground state for every @xmath115 .",
    "it is worth noting that both @xmath114 and @xmath116 ( or @xmath117 ) are eigenstates of @xmath118 . in any case , eigenstates of @xmath119 are excitations . in fig .",
    "[ energie ] , we plot the lowest energy levels for a chain of eight spins .",
    "the transition @xmath120 is observed .    while @xmath114 is an eigenstate of the symmetry operator @xmath66 ,",
    "this is not true in the case of @xmath98 and @xmath100 .",
    "in fact , @xmath121 . the possibility of obtaining a coherent emission of light on the bosonic mode is inherently linked to the breakdown of the hamiltonian symmetry , since the only coherent state which is also an eigenstate of @xmath122}$ ] is the vacuum . while symmetry breaking takes place independently of the system size ( the number of spins ) , only in the thermodynamic limit does a true phase transition take place , since the hilbert spaces that can be built up starting from @xmath98 and @xmath100 become unitarily nonequivalent .     as a function of @xmath90 for a chain of 8 spins .",
    "both the energy and @xmath90 are measured in units of @xmath20 or @xmath123 ( we assume @xmath124 ) . for",
    "any given number of particles , only the lower level is plotted .",
    "the solid green line represents the energy of @xmath98 and @xmath100 , while the solid black line corresponds to @xmath114 .",
    "as we can see , there is only one transition , occurring at @xmath125 .",
    "all energies derived from numbers of fermions different from @xmath126 are excitations .",
    "specifically , the dotted green line represents the energy of the one - particle state , the dotted red line is for the two - particle state , and the dotted black line corresponds to the three - particle state . due to the particle - hole symmetry ,",

    ", they are correct only in the thermodynamic limit , while in the case of finite size , as in the example in fig .",
    "[ energie ] , corrections to the energy levels are expected .",
    "actually , the structure of eigenfrequencies giving rise to the phase transition from @xmath128 to @xmath114 can be observed also in the case of a very short open chain ( @xmath129 ) .    in the presence of multimode radiation , hamiltonian ( [ htilde ] ) can be recovered modifying hamiltonian ( [ acca ] ) in the following way @xmath130 + \\sum_n\\gamma_n a^{\\dag}_n a_n\\nonumber\\\\&&+\\sum_n\\sqrt{\\frac{\\lambda_n \\gamma_n}{n}}(a_n^{\\dag}+a_n)\\sum_{l=1}^n\\sigma_{l}^{z},\\label{accamm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and it is subject to the symmetry @xmath131}$ ] .",

    "the two degenerate ground states are @xmath140 and @xmath141 , while for @xmath142 the non degenerate half filled ground state is @xmath143 .    to clarify the proposal , we comment on the preparation scheme needed to observe phase transitions in this system .",
    "as mentioned in @xcite , the procedure consists in initialization to the state @xmath144 , and then adiabatic switching of the spin - spin couplings .",
    "this process is repeated several times for different ratios of @xmath145 , while the phase transition is detected through fluorescence of the ions internal levels , as experimentally realized in @xcite . here",
    ", we also need to perform motional ground - state cooling as far as axial degrees of freedom are concerned .",
    "the possible errors in simulating this model with trapped ions comes from the canonical transformation and @xmath146 , where the error is quantified by the boson displacements and the mean phonon number ( given by temperature ) of the neglected transverse modes . therefore they have to be cooled down too @xcite .",
    "in this section we analyze the phase transition at finite temperature in the so - called adiabatic limit ( @xmath147 ) with a single coupled mode .",
    "this limit corresponds to the case of a very slowly oscillating phonon and it is asymptotically exact at high temperatures . the adiabatic hamiltonian is obtained by neglecting the kinetic energy of the phonon and treating the coordinate as a parameter @xmath148+\\frac{\\nu^2}{4 \\lambda}+ \\frac{\\nu}{\\sqrt{n}}\\sum_{l=1}^n\\sigma_{l}^{z},\\ ] ] where we introduced the adimensional coordinate @xmath149 .",
    "the hamiltonian is a isotropic @xmath0 model in an external field , parametrically dependent on @xmath150 , it can be diagonalized in the same way as described previously and reduced in two blocks corresponding to odd and even pseudofermion occupation number @xmath151 with @xmath152 $ ] .",

    "the phase diagram obtained is plotted in fig . [",
    "fig : ph_diag ] .",
    "the experimental procedure to measure the phase transition is exactly as in the zero - temperature case .",
    "the radial vibrations should be cooled , while the axial degrees of freedom can be prepared in a `` thermal state '' .",
    "the temperature of this state can be controlled by reducing the power of the laser ( resolved sideband ) cooling mechanism . to raise it further",
    ", the power of the doppler laser cooling has to be tuned .",
    "we still expect to observe an abrupt change in fluorescence properties , as in the zero - temperature case , since for moderate temperatures the coherent state @xmath161 becomes thermal , but the mean number of phonons does not disappear abruptly . according to fig .",
    "[ fig : ph_diag ] , the order parameter value should change as a function of @xmath162 .",
    "to resume , we have shown that a system of trapped ions can be mapped into an isotropic @xmath0 chain interacting with phonons , following the scheme in ref .",
    "@xcite . modifying the original canonical transformations needed to write a spin - spin hamiltonian ,",
    "the vibrational degrees of freedom along a fixed direction are coupled with the effective spins the other degrees of freedom are mapped onto .",
    "the resulting model is exactly solvable and exhibits a quantum phase transition , due to the breaking of a symmetry which takes into account both the spin and the boson degrees of freedom . in this phase , phonons are in a coherent state with finite amplitude . since the phonons refer to the real ionic vibration and not to an effective quantity , phase transition detection should be possible using state - of - the - art techniques .",
