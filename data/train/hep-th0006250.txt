    "although it is considered that a scalar field has not been observed in nature as a fundamental field its use as such is very frequent in the modern literature , particularly in elementary particles , field theory and cosmology . here we will apply to the scalar field the concepts and results developed in the reference @xcite , referred here as the paper i , where the concept of a discrete field was introduced and its wave equation and its green s function discussed . the standard field and its formalism , which for a distinction , we always append the qualification continuous ,",
    "are retrieved from an integration over the discrete - field parameters .",
    "remarkable in the discrete field is that it has none of the problems that plague the continuous one so that the meaning and origin of these problems can be left exposed on the passage from the discrete to the continuous formalism .",
    "although the motivations for the introduction of a generic discrete field in paper i have being made on pure physical grounds of causality , a deeper discussion about its physical interpretation have been left for subsequent papers on specific fields .",
    "this discussion will be retaken here with the simplest structure of a field , the scalar one .",
    "it would be a too easy posture to see the discrete scalar field as just an ancillary mathematical construct devoid of any physical meaning , and this vision could be re - enforced with the discrete field being just a point propagating with the speed of light .",
    "the idea of a point - like field may sound weird at a first sight but this represents the same symmetry of quantum field theory where fields and sources are equally treated as quantized fields .",
    "here it is seen from a reversal and classical perspective .",
    "besides , point - like objects was never a novelty in physics and one of the major motivations of the , nowadays so popular , string theory is of avoiding @xcite infinities and acausalities in the fields produced by point sources , a problem that do not exist for the discrete field , according to the reference @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it could look peculiar , considering the still doubtful existence of a fundamental scalar field , that it be the one picked for discussing attribution of physical reality to a discrete field .",
    "this usual strategy of considering the simplest problems first , even if just as a preliminary academical exercise , produced however , unexpected bonus .",
    "it turns out from the discrete field analysis that the scalar field is , necessarily , the gravitational field of general relativity , whose character of a second - rank tensor is assured by the way the scalar field is attached to the definition of the metric tensor . after decoding the physical meaning of the scalar field sources one is led to the unavoidable conclusion that there is no place , in this context , for the existence of any other fundamental scalar field .",
    "this has deeper implications , discussed at the end of the paper .",
    "this paper is structured in the following way .",
    "section ii , on the sake of a brief review of the mathematical definition of discrete fields , is a recipe on how to pass from a continuous to a discrete formalism , and vice - versa . the discrete scalar field , its wave equation , its lagrangian and its energy tensor are discussed in section iii and the consequences of discrete interactions for the mathematical description of the physical world in section iv .",
    "calculus ( integration and differentiation ) which is based on the opposite idea of smoothness and continuity , has its full validity for describing dynamics restricted then to a very efficient approximation in the case of a high density of interaction points , as turns out to be the great majority of cases of physical interest .",
    "this seems to be an answer to the wigner s pondering @xcite about the reasons behind the unexpected effectiveness of mathematics on the physical description of the world .",
    "it is argued in section v , after analysing the results of the section iv , that the scalar field must necessarily describe the gravitational interaction of general relativity .",
    "section vi brings the conclusions .",

    "all the information contained in the new action ( [ da1 ] ) can be incorporated in the old action ( [ a ] ) , without the mass term , with the simple inclusion of the constraint ( [ hplane ] ) ar s_p = d^4xd(+f.x)\\{^__-(x,)(x , ) } , as the very restriction to the hyperplane ( [ hplane ] ) by itself implies on the whole recipe ( [ recipe ] ) .",

    "but as it will be made clear in section v , there is no point on considering a massive discrete scalar field because any discrete scalar field must be associated to the gravitational field of general relativity .",

    "@xmath52 and @xmath53 do not contribute @xcite to @xmath54 except at @xmath55 as a further consequence of the field constraints .",

    "it is justified naming @xmath61 a discrete field because although being a field it is not null at just one space point at a time ; but it is not a distribution , a dirac delta function , as it is everywhere and always finite .",
    "its differentiability , in the sense of having space and time derivatives , is however assured by its dependence on @xmath28 , a known , supposedly continuous spacetime function .",
    "it is indeed a new concept of field , a very peculiar one , discrete and differentiable ; it is just a finite point - like spacetime deformation projected on a null direction , with a well defined and everywhere conserved energy - momentum .",
    "it is this discreteness in a field that allows the union of wave - like and particle - like properties in a same physical object , which implies @xcite finiteness and no spurious degree of freedom ( uniqueness of solutions ) .",
    "from eq . ( [ afv ] )",
    "we see that the field @xmath61 is given , essentially , by the charge at its retarded time , i.e. the amount of scalar charge at @xmath32 , the event of its creation .",
    "@xmath61 has a physical meaning in the sense of having a content of energy and momentum when and only when @xmath63 .",
    "so , the emission or the absorption of a scalar field is , respectively , consequence or cause of a change in the amount of scalar charge on its source .",
    "this is so because emitting or absorbing a scalar field requires a change in the state of its source which is so poor of structure that has nothing else to change but itself , and this is fundamental for determining the scalar charge nature . the picture becomes clearer after recalling that one is dealing with discrete field and discrete interactions implying that the change in the state of a field source occurs at an isolated event .",

    "the naive use of dasdd q = q()(-_z ) , would be just an insistence on an unappropriate continuous formalism , besides artificially introducing infinities where there is none .",
    "it means that one must replace time derivatives by finite differences finitedif q ( ) and a proper - time integration by a sum over the interaction points on the charge world line .",
    "the existence and meaning of any physical property that corresponds to a time derivative must be reconsidered at this fundamental level .",
    "velocity ( @xmath65 exists as a piecewise smoothly continuous function ( discontinuous at the interaction points ) . acceleration ( @xmath66 ) and derivative concepts like force ( @xmath67 ) , power ( @xmath22 ) , etc rigorously do not exist .",
    "we must deal with finite differences , respectively , the sudden changes of velocity ( @xmath68 ) , momentum ( @xmath69 ) and energy ( @xmath70 ) : reciped so , calculus ( integration and differentiation ) in a discrete - interaction context becomes useless for a rigourous description of fundamental physical processes .",
    "but in practice such a strictly discrete calculus is not always feasible . what effectively counts is the scale determined by @xmath71 , the time interval between two consecutive interaction events , face the accuracy of the measuring apparatus .",
    "the question is if @xmath71 is large enough to be detectable , or how accurate is the measuring apparatus used to detect it .",
    "the density of interaction points on the world line of a given point charge is proportional to the number of point charges with which it interacts .",
    "let one consider the most favourable case of a system made of just two point charges . as the argument is supposedly valid for all fundamental interactions one can take the hydrogen atom in its ground state for consideration , treating the proton as if it were also a fundamental point particle .",
    "the order of scale of @xmath71 for an electron in the ground state of a hydrogen atom is given then by the bohr radius divided by the speed of light @xmath72 which corresponds to a number of @xmath73 interactions per period ( @xmath74 is the fine - structure constant ) or @xmath75 interactions / cm .",
    "so , the electron world line is so densely packed with interaction events that one can , in an effectively good descriptions for most of the cases , replace the graph of the figure 1 by a continuously smooth curve .",
    "the validity of calculus in physics is then fully re - established as a consequence of the limitations of the measuring apparatus .",
    "the wigner s questions@xcite about the unexpected effectiveness of mathematics in the physical description of the world is recalled .",
    "the answer lies on the huge number of point sources in interaction ( a sufficient condition ) , the large value of the speed of light and the small ( in a manly scale ) size of atomic and sub - atomic systems , which indirectly is a consequence of h , the planck constant .",
    "although @xmath71 may not be measurable , at least with the present technology , the discrete formalism is justified not for replacing the continuous one where it is best , which is confirmed by high precision experiments @xcite but mostly for defining and understanding its limitations .",
    "there are , besides this very generic justification , many instances of one - interaction - event phenomena , like the compton effect , particle decay , radiation emission from bound - state systems , etc , where discrete interactions are the natural and the more appropriate approach .",
    "these are , of course , all examples of quantum phenomena , but primarily because quantum here implies discreteness .",
    "a discrete field with discrete interactions not only requires a proper quantum context but it makes easier and natural the passage from the classical one .",
    "this is being discussed in the companion paper@xcite .",
    "discrete - continuous transition    it would be interesting to have a framework where this change from continuous to discrete interaction and vice - versa could be formally realized in a simple and direct way .",
    "one can deal with them considering the behaviour under a derivative operator of @xmath76 which is the mathematical description of the interaction discreteness .",
    "then one must require that , symbolically dk ( -_i):=__i , with @xmath77 the kronecker delta _ _ i= with the meaning that at the points where the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ dk ] ) is not null , which are the only relevant ones , @xmath28 must be treated as a discrete variable and that the operator @xmath78 must be seen as ( or replaced by ) just a sudden increment @xmath79 and not as the limit of the quotient of two increments .",

    "a real field always corresponds to a sudden change in its source state at its retarded time .",
    "if there is no change the field is not real , in the sense of having zero energy and zero momentum . having no physical attribute it corresponds to the pure  gauge field \" of the continuous formalism .",
    "it takes an external agent on the scalar source to cause a change @xmath84 on its charge @xmath85 ; a positive @xmath84 means that a scalar field @xmath21 has been absorbed whereas a negative one means an emission .",
    "therefore , a discrete scalar field carries itself a charge @xmath84 and can , consequently , interact with other charge carriers and be a source or a sink for other discrete scalar fields .",
    "it carries a bit of its very source , a scalar charge ; it is an abelian charged field . on the other hand a new look at equations ( [ psf ] ) and ( [ ac ] ) reveals that @xmath86 describes the energy content of the field .",
    "so , the source of a discrete scalar field is any physical object endowed with energy which corresponds then to the scalar charge .",

    "this implies that the discrete scalar field satisfies the principle of equivalence and that all physical objects interact with the scalar field through its energy - tensor .",

    "so , @xmath21must necessarily be connected to the gravitational field .",
    "having necessarily energy for source implies on an important consequence of uniqueness , of excluding the existence of any other distinct fundamental discrete scalar field as it must necessarily be taken as the gravitational field .",
    "moreover , as energy is not a scalar , the symmetry between discrete fields and sources , both taken as fundamental fields , implies also that there is no fundamental scalar source representing an elementary field ; it must be a scalar function of a non - scalar fundamental field , like the trace of an energy tensor , for example .",
    "this lets then explicit a known symmetry of nature : the four fundamental interactions are described by gauge fields having for sources vector currents ( schematically , @xmath87 ) , of their respective charges @xmath85 , including gravity since the energy tensor is just a current of its charge , the four - vector momentum .",

    "the point is that for gravity it is extremely doubtful that it could make an experimentally detectable difference .",
    "it is not a novelty that , considering the small strength of the gravitational coupling this interaction is irrelevant for physical systems involving relatively few fundamental elements .",
    "observe that even a gravitational aharanov - bohm - like experiment @xcite would require the gravitational field of a macroscopically large object , like the earth .",
    "the sufficient condition for a high density of interaction points is assured and justifies continuous descriptions of gravity , of which general relativity is undoubtedly the best proposal @xcite .",
    "moreover the undectability of discrete gravity is tantamount to the unobservability of the minkowski spacetime . at this level of approximation",
    "the minkowski spacetime becomes the local tangent space of a curved space - time and @xmath12 is a generator of the local hypercone in the tangent space .",
    "this would lead to full general relativity in accordance to a general uniqueness result @xcite that any metric theory with field equations linear in second derivatives of the metric , without higher - order derivatives in the field equations , satisfying the newtonian limit for weak fields and without any prior geometry must be exactly einstein gravity itself .",
    "this reminds again the already mentioned @xcite derivation of general relativity from flat spacetime but now with the distinctive aspect that the effective riemann space comes not from a consistency requirement but as an approximation validated by a recognized limitation on the present experimental capacity . on the other hand , the knowledge of a supposedly true discrete character of all fundamental interactions ,",
    "gravity included , is a permanent reminder of the limits of such a continuous approximative description , irrespective of how good their results fit with experiments .",
    "the idea of an essential continuity of any physical interaction allows unlimited speculations that will always go beyond any level of possible experimental verifications which brings then the risk of not being able of distinguishing the reign of possibly experimentally - grounded scientific research from plain philosophical speculation or even just fiction . a discrete gravitational interaction ,",
    "even if not experimentally detectable , still for a long time to come , may just make sense of existing theories as it has historically happened with all new discreteness introduced in the past , like the ideas of molecules , atomic transitions , and quarks , for example .",
