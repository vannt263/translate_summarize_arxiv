    "the forthcoming ten petawatt laser systems , vulcan-10pw in the united kingdom ( 300 j , 30 fs ) and apollon in france ( 150 j , 15 fs ) , will pave the way to the exawatt eli project aiming to reach intensities in excess of @xmath1 .",
    "this will lead to unexplored laser - matter scenarii , characterized by coupled plasma and quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) processes . in order to enhance these novel effects",
    ", a favourable configuration relies upon the interaction of the laser pulse with counter - propagating , multi - gev electrons . at laser intensities",
    "up to @xmath2 , the electron dynamics enters the so - called radiation - dominated regime characterized by strong production of high - energy photons via nonlinear compton scattering . interacting back with the laser field",
    ", these photons can lead to efficient production of @xmath3 pairs ( via the breit - wheeler mechanism ) . the resulting dense pair plasma , beyond its fundamental interest ,",
    "can potentially modify the overall laser - plasma interaction @xcite .",
    "the importance of qed effects on a relativistic electron of mass @xmath4 , charge @xmath5 and energy @xmath6 , and on a photon of energy @xmath7 , both interacting with a monochromatic plane wave @xmath8 , depends on the respective lorentz - invariant quantum parameters : @xmath9^{1/2 } , & & \\chi_{\\gamma } = \\frac{\\gamma _ \\gamma}{e_s } \\left [ \\left(\\mathbf{e_{\\perp } } + \\mathbf{c}\\times \\mathbf{b}\\right)^2 \\right]^{1/2 } , \\label{eq : etachi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is the schwinger field beyond which the electromagnetic field can no longer be treated classically .",
    "the energy distribution of the production rate of photons is given by @xcite @xmath11 , \\label{eq : dnsync_dtdgammae}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the fine structure constant , @xmath13 the compton length and @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "for @xmath15 ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) , large numbers of photons are emitted , each taking away a small fraction of the electron energy .",
    "the emission process can be therefore treated classically and modelled as a continuous damping reaction . by constrast , in the quantum regime , for @xmath18 ( @xmath19 )",
    ", fewer photons are emitted , but their energies can be comparable to that of the electron , leading to strong recoils and discontinuous trajectories .",
    "finally , for high - energy photons ( @xmath20 ) interacting with the laser field , the energy distribution of the probability to decay into @xmath0 pair is given by @xcite @xmath21 } .",
    "\\label{eq : dnpm_dtdgamma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath22 refers to the energy of the created electron .",
    "particle - in - cell ( pic ) codes are efficient tools for simulating the kinetic evolution of plasmas subjected to intense electromagnetic waves @xcite .",
    "the pic code calder has been enriched with physical models describing photon and pair generation . in the pic description ,",
    "particles are represented by super - particles with given density , shape and momenta .",
    "radiative and qed models are applied on the super - particles and we similarly define the notion of super - photons generated during the emission process . in the classical radiative regime ,",
    "the model considered is based on sokolov s scheme for radiation damping @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the lorentz force vector and @xmath25 .",
    "the radiated power is calculated using the quantum equation ( [ eq : dnsync_dtdgammae ] ) : @xmath26    in the quantum radiative regime , the monte carlo ( mc ) description is well - suited to treating the stochastic character of the photon generation @xcite .",
    "this is valid provided that the field is uniform and quasi - static during the emission process .",
    "propagating electrons are assigned an optical depth @xmath27 , evolving with time according to the field and the electron energy , @xmath28 in the mc algorithm , a discrete photon is emitted when @xmath29 , where the total optical depth @xmath30 is sampled from @xmath31 with @xmath32 0,1]$ ] a uniform random number .",
    "the photon quantum paramater @xmath33 is calculated by inverting @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the the photon cumulative distribution function and @xmath36 $ ] is a new random parameter .",
    "the photon is emitted to the direction parallel to the electron velocity with wave vector @xmath37 ( since the angular spread is @xmath38 ) .",
    "the electron momentum @xmath39 therefore becomes @xmath40 a similar mc scheme is applied to the super - photons to model pair creation using the probability function ( [ eq : dnpm_dtdgamma ] ) .",
    "each photon is assigned an optical depth @xmath41 and a randomly sampled final one @xmath42.when @xmath43 , the super - photon is deleted and a @xmath3 pair is created at the current position . solving @xmath44 gives the newly - created electron quantum parameter @xmath45 , @xmath46 being randomly calculated in @xmath470,1\\right]$ ] and @xmath48 the cumulative distribution function associated to the pair generation .",
    "the positron quantum parameter is @xmath49 . as the mc radiative model leads to the generation of many low - energy photons unable to decay into pairs and prejudicial for the numerical efficiency ( most notably in configurations prone to pair cascading )",
    ", we usually restrict the creation of super - photons to energies above @xmath50 .",
    "moreover , we have worked out a coalescence scheme ensuring energy and momentum conservation on average .",
    "as a test simulation , we consider the photon and pair generation by electrons of initial energy @xmath51 in a constant magnetic field @xmath52 .",
    "the initial quantum parameter is equal to @xmath53 .",
    "the initial synchrotron frequency and radius are respectively equal to @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "we define @xmath56 the energy distributions of the positrons , electrons and photons , respectively .",
    "the time evolution of the latter can be described by the following set of equations @xcite @xmath57    ) and ( [ eq : spc_th2 ] ) ( top).,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    ) and ( [ eq : spc_th2 ] ) ( top).,scaledwidth=87.0% ]    the time evolution of the total energy , density and averaged quantum parameter is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : time_diag_group ] for each species .",
    "figure [ fig : spc_group ] displays the corresponding energy distributions . very good agreement is obtained between the numerical solutions of eqs . ( [ eq : spc_th1 ] ) and ( [ eq : spc_th2 ] ) and the mc - pic simulations .",
    "the interaction starts in the quantum regime .",
    "the firstly created photons have an energy close to initial electron energy , @xmath58 .",
    "consequently , the radiated energy significantly grows during the first rotation at the expense of the electron energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : time_diag_group]a ) .",
    "the average photon quantum parameter is close to @xmath59 ( fig [ fig : time_diag_group]c ) , which is favourable for pair production . in turn , newly generated particles radiate their energy away , hence leading to pair cascading ( fig .",
    "[ fig : time_diag_group]b ) .",
    "when entering the semi - classical regime , the production rate of positrons tends to stabilize since the average photon energy drops below the pair creation threshold ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "radiation losses , originally responsible for pair creation , now only act as a cooling mechanism . note that in the quantum regime , the stochasticity , intrinsic to the qed processes stretches the electron energy spectrum , whereas in the semi - classical regime , radiation losses tend to shrink it back .",
    "we have presented the implementation in a pic code of the photon and pair generation via the compton scattering and breit wheeler processes .",
    "these physical models will be used in forthcoming papers to study a number of laser - plasma scenarii at ultra - relativistic intensities .",
