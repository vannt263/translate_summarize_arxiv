    "a triangulation is a decomposition into triangles . in this paper",
    "we are interested in triangulations of point sets in the euclidean plane , where the input is a set of points in the plane , denoted @xmath10 , and a triangulation is defined as a subdivision of the convex hull of @xmath10 into triangles whose vertices are the points in @xmath10 .",
    "it is a well - known fact that @xmath11 points in the plane can have many different triangulations . for most application domains ,",
    "the choice of the triangulation is important , because different triangulations can have different effects .",
    "for example , two important fields in which triangulations are frequently used are finite element methods and terrain modeling . in the first case ,",
    "triangulations are used to subdivide a complex domain by creating a mesh of simple elements ( triangles ) , over which a system of differential equations can be solved more easily . in the second case ,",
    "the points in @xmath10 represent points sampled from a terrain ( thus each point has also an elevation ) , and the triangulation provides a bivariate interpolating surface , providing an elevation model of the terrain . in both cases , the shapes of the triangles can have serious consequences on the result . for mesh generation for finite element methods",
    ", the aspect ratio of the triangles is particularly important , since elements of large aspect ratio can lead to poorly - conditioned systems .",
    "similarly , long and skinny triangles are generally not appropriate for surface interpolation because they can lead to interpolation from points that are too far apart .    in most applications , the need for _ well - shaped _",
    "triangulations is usually addressed by using the _ delaunay _ triangulation .",
    "the delaunay triangulation of a point set @xmath10 is defined as a triangulation where the vertices are the points in @xmath10 and the circumcircle of each triangle ( that is , the circle defined by the three vertices of each triangle ) contains no other point from @xmath10 .",
    "the delaunay triangulation has many known properties that make it the most widely - used triangulation .",
    "in particular , there are several efficient and relatively simple algorithms to compute it , and its triangles are considered _ well - shaped_. this is because it maximizes the minimum angle among all triangle angles , which implies that its angles are  in a sense_as large as possible_. moreover , when the points are in general position ( that is , when no four points are cocircular and no three points are collinear ) it is uniquely defined .",
    "however , this last property can become an important limitation if the delaunay triangulation is suboptimal with respect to other criteria , independent of the shape of its triangles , as it is often the case in applications .    to overcome this limitation , gudmundsson et al .",
    "proposed _ higher order delaunay triangulations _",
    "they are a natural generalization of the delaunay triangulation that provides well - shaped triangles , but at the same time , flexibility to optimize some extra criterion .",
    "they are defined by allowing up to @xmath0 points inside the circumcircles of the triangles ( see figure  [ fig : figorders ] ) . for @xmath12 ,",
    "each point set in general position has only one higher order delaunay triangulation , equal to the delaunay triangulation . as the parameter @xmath0",
    "is increased , more points inside the circumcircles imply a reduction of the shape quality of the triangles , but also an increase in the number of triangulations that are considered .",
    "this last aspect makes the optimization of extra criteria possible , thus providing triangulations that are a compromise between well - shaped triangles and optimality with respect to other criteria .    ) . center : an order-@xmath13 triangulation ( with useful-1 , non - delaunay , edges in gray ) .",
    "right : an order-@xmath14 triangulation , with order-1 triangles in light gray and order-2 triangles in medium gray . ]    therefore the importance of higher order delaunay triangulations  lies in multi - criteria triangulations .",
    "their major contribution is providing a way to optimize over a  hopefully large  class of well - shaped triangulations .",
    "a particularly important subclass of higher order delaunay triangulations  are the _ first order delaunay triangulations _",
    ", that is , when @xmath15 .",
    "it has been observed that already for @xmath15 , a point set with @xmath11 points can have an exponential number of different triangulations  @xcite .",
    "this , together with the fact that for @xmath15 the shape of the triangles is as close as possible to the shape of the delaunay triangles ( while allowing more than one triangulation to choose from ) , make first order delaunay triangulations especially interesting .",
    "in fact , first order delaunay triangulations  have been shown to have a special structure that facilitates the optimization of many criteria  @xcite .",
    "for example , it has been shown that many criteria related to measures of single triangles , as well as some other relevant parameters like the number of local minima , can be optimized in @xmath16 time for @xmath15 . in a recent paper  @xcite , van kreveld et al .",
    "studied several types of more complex optimization problems , constrained to first order delaunay triangulations .",
    "they showed that many other criteria can be also optimized efficiently for @xmath15 , making first order delaunay triangulations  even more appealing for practical use .    for larger values of @xmath0 ,",
    "fewer results are known .",
    "the special structure of first order delaunay triangulations  is not present anymore , which complicates exact optimization algorithms .",
    "several heuristics and experimental results have been presented for optimization problems related to terrain modeling , showing that very small values of @xmath0 ( @xmath17 ) are enough to achieve important improvements for several terrain criteria  @xcite .    however , despite the importance given to finding algorithms to optimize over higher order delaunay triangulations , it has never been studied before how many higher order delaunay triangulations  there can be in the first place . in other words , it is not known what the minimum and maximum number of different triangulations are , as functions of @xmath0 and @xmath11 , not even for the simpler ( but  in practice  most important ) case of first order delaunay triangulations .",
    "the problem of determining bounds on the number of higher order delaunay triangulations  is of both theoretical and practical interest .    from a theoretical point of view",
    ", determining how many triangulations a point set has is one of the most intriguing problems in combinatorial geometry , and has received a lot of attention ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "higher order delaunay triangulations  are a natural and simple generalization of the delaunay triangulation , hence the impact of such generalization on the number of triangulations is worth studying .    from a more practical point of view , knowing the number of triangulations for a given @xmath0 gives an idea of how large the solution space is when optimizing over this class of well - shaped triangulations . ideally , one expects to have many different triangulations to choose from , in order to find one that is _ good _ with respect to other criteria .    up to now",
    ", only trivial bounds were known : every point set has at least one order-@xmath0 delaunay triangulation , for any @xmath0 ( equal to the delaunay triangulation ) , and there are point sets of size @xmath11 that have @xmath18 triangulations , already for @xmath15 . in this paper",
    "we present the first non - trivial bounds on the number of higher order delaunay triangulations . given the practical motivation mentioned above , we are mostly interested in results that have practical implications for the use of higher order delaunay triangulations",
    ". thus low values of @xmath0 are our main concern .",
    "our ultimate goal  achieved partially in this paper  is to determine to what extent the class of higher order delaunay triangulations  ( for small values of @xmath0 , which has the best triangle - shape properties ) , also provides a _",
    "large _ number of triangulations to choose from .",
    "[ [ results ] ] results + + + + + + +    we study lower and upper bounds on the number of higher order delaunay triangulations , as well as the expected number of order-@xmath0 delaunay triangulations for uniformly distributed points .",

    "first we show that the lower bound @xmath21 is tight .",
    "in other words , there are arbitrarily large point sets that have a single higher order delaunay triangulation , even for large values of @xmath0 .",
    "next we show that , for first order delaunay triangulations , @xmath22 .",
    "since these extreme cases do not describe an average situation when higher order delaunay triangulations  are used , we then study the number of higher order delaunay triangulations  for a uniformly distributed point set .",

    "these points are initially placed on a circle @xmath89 that goes through @xmath90 , as shown in the figure ; they are sorted from top to bottom .",
    "the second group comprises @xmath0 points @xmath91 , placed very close to each other on a circle @xmath92 through @xmath90 , as shown in the figure .",
    "in addition , we must also make sure that the points @xmath91 are close enough to @xmath90 in order to be contained inside @xmath93 .",
