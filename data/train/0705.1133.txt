    "recently phenix published measurement of direct photons in different centrality ranges in @xmath1 au+au collisions up to @xmath2=14gev / c.@xciteat the high @xmath2 range , direct photons are produced in initial parton - parton scatterings , quark - gluon compton scattering @xmath3 and quark - antiquark annihilation @xmath4 which are well described by perturbative quantum chromodynamics(pqcd ) .",
    "the direct photon yield is determined through the comparison of the inclusive photon yield to the expected yield of background photons from hadronic decays .",
    "the comparison is done in terms of the ratio of @xmath5 , or in short @xmath6 since many systematic errors such as energy scale uncertainties cancel .",
    "the photon excess then can be expressed directly as a double ratio of measured photons per @xmath7 to the expectation from hadronic decays , @xmath8 .",
    "the double ratio in fig .  [ publishresult ] indicates that there is a significant direct photons signal for @xmath9 and it is consistent with the binary scaled pqcd model calculation from p+p collisions.@xcite apparently , the direct photons production is in direct contrast to high @xmath2 hadrons suppression observed in au+au collisions.@xcite    at low @xmath10 range where a significant fraction of direct photons is expected to come from the thermalized medium of deconfined quarks and gluons , the measurement is very challenging .",
    "these so - called thermal photons carry information about the initial temperature of the quark gluon plasma(qgp ) .",
    "but the huge background from @xmath7 decay and the relatively large systematic uncertainties at low @xmath10 limit our ability to make any statement about this direct photon source .    in order to improve and understand the direct photon production in the low and medium @xmath2 range ,",
    "phenix has already carried out several new analysis techniques on run4 au+au @xmath1 dataset , including using low mass dielectron pairs from internal conversions@xcite and external photon conversions in the beam pipe.@xcite unlike conventional direct photon method with the emcal , these two new techniques both take the advantages of the excellent capabilities of the phenix detector to measure electrons . due to the excellent resolution of charged particles at low momenta , a significant measurement for @xmath11 was achieved(see fig .  [ conversion ] ) .",
    "the method presented here still uses photon candidates from emcal and conventional double ratio technique but instead of measuring @xmath7 yield in the double ratio of @xmath12 , we measure @xmath13 which are photons from @xmath14 decay by reconstruction of photon pairs invariant mass . in this new method",
    "we will have to compare @xmath15 for inclusive photons in data with the corresponding one for hadronic decay photons , which we can obtain from monte - carlo simulation .",
    "since @xmath16 and @xmath13 are basically the same physics quantities , many correction factors such as detector efficiency and acceptance cancel out explicitly and so do the systematic uncertainties introduced by these factors .",
    "the data presented in this proceeding were collected during the 2004 au+au @xmath1 run of rhic by the phenix experiment .",
    "the emcal in the two central arms ( @xmath17 ) is used to obtain the raw inclusive photon candidate .",
    "the emcal consists of two subsystems : six sectors of lead - scintillator sandwich calorimeter(pbsc ) and two sectors of lead - glass cherenkov calorimeter(pbgl ) . in this analysis",
    ", we only use the pbsc part and events with the vertex @xmath18 from the collision center .",
    "that leaves us about 700 million minimum bias events after various quality assurances .",
    "a series of stringent pid cuts are applied on photon - like clusters in the emcal based on the time - of - flight(tof ) and the shower profile(@xmath19 ) .",
    "furthermore , charged particle contamination is removed by associating clusters in the emcal with charged hits in the pad chambers(pc3 ) positioned directly in front of emcal so it provides a clean photon sample .",
    "a minimum @xmath2 cut of @xmath20 is also applied .      in each event , these clean photons @xmath21 are combined with photons reconstructed in the emcal under loose pid cuts(@xmath19 & tof & @xmath22 but without pc3 veto ) and their invariant mass is calculated , generating a foreground of physics pairs .",
    "the combinatorial background is removed by event - mixing technique , which creates uncorrelated photon pairs from different events .",
    "the mixed event spectra is normalized to the corresponding real photon pair invariant mass distributions below(@xmath23 ) and above(@xmath24 ) the @xmath7 peak then subtracted from the foreground .",
    "[ peakextraction ] shows normalized background together with foreground(left ) and subtracted foreground(right ) for clean photon @xmath2 range from @xmath25 to @xmath26 .",
    "a gaussian plus second - order polynomial function is used here to fit the @xmath7 mass peak since there is still some background residual left beneath the peak after subtraction .",
    "so the contribution from @xmath14 tagged as @xmath27 can be determined by interpolating the gaussian fit .",
    "@xmath28    the number of clean photons and the contribution tagged as coming from @xmath7 decay are measured as a function of @xmath2 of clean photons . as eq .",
    "[ eq : inclusive ] indicates , the measured yield of clean photons @xmath21 depends on the reconstruction efficiency @xmath29 and the geometry acceptance @xmath30 . since charged tracks are removed by the pc3 veto cut , a hadron contamination correction mostly coming from neutron and antineutron has to be applied where @xmath31 is the ratio of the remaining hadrons to all clusters that satisfy the clean photon s pid cuts . the tagged photon yield @xmath32(eq .",
    "[ eq : piontag ] ) has an additional dependence on the loose - pid - cuts photons efficiency @xmath33 , the conversion correction @xmath34 and the conditional probability @xmath35 to find a loose - pid - cuts photon in the phenix acceptance , given that its @xmath7 partner clean photon is already reconstructed and accepted(see section [ simulation ] ) .",
    "therefore , by calculating the ratio between @xmath21 and @xmath32 , the efficiency and acceptance for clean photons are explicitly canceled out .",
    "the loss of @xmath32 due to photon conversion @xmath36 is corrected and the conversion correction is estimated by the material budget between the collision vertex and the pc3 in front of the emcal .",
    "the conversion material in run 4 has been estimated around @xmath37 and it is slightly different among different detector areas .",
    "since we use a tagging method to measure clean photons from @xmath7 decay , only loose - pid - cuts photons are affected due to the conversion loss .",
    "therefore a correction factor of @xmath38 is applied .      a similar ratio between the hadronic decay photon yield @xmath39(eq .",
    "[ eq : calculated ] ) and the tagged photon yield from @xmath7 decays @xmath32(eq .  [ eq : calculatedpiontag ] ) can be calculated from simulations where the acceptance @xmath30 is canceled again .",
    "@xmath40    the decay photon calculations are determined by a fast monte - carlo simulation of @xmath7 and @xmath41 decays .",
    "the phenix measured @xmath7 spectrum@xcite is used and the @xmath41 distribution is calculated based on @xmath42-scaling .",
    "the normalization factor of @xmath43 at high @xmath2 is used.@xcitethe emcal energy resolution of @xmath44 is applied and a detailed description of the emcal active areas from data are used in the simulation . from the eq .",
    "( [ eq : calculated ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : calculatedpiontag ] ) we will have @xmath45 on the left side of eq .",
    "[ simulationratio ] @xmath46 is a straightforward physics quantity of excess photons contribution from other hadronic sources than @xmath7 and depends only on the @xmath47 ratio and @xmath48 decay branching ratio .",
    "so after applying the conditional probability @xmath35 which is depends on @xmath7 decay kinematics and the emcal active areas , the ratio @xmath49 can be directly compared to the measured one .    in order to estimate the reconstruction efficiency @xmath50 of loose - pid - cuts photons , a pisa ( phenix integrated simulation application ) simulation of single particles with the complete phenix setup based on the geant package",
    "is conducted .",
    "the data from the simulation then is merged with the emcal data from the real events . by reconstructing the properties of these embedded particles , the occupancy effect of the detector in au+au collisions can be estimated . after including all the loose - pid - cuts , the efficiency is determined to be around @xmath51 independent of @xmath2 beyond the minimum @xmath2 cutoff of @xmath20 .",
    "the hadron contamination contribution @xmath31 is also calculated with a full pisa simulation .",
    "@xmath7 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are generated as input particles by using the actual phenix measured spectra.@xcitethe spectrum of @xmath55 is estimated based on measured proton and antiproton cross sections . for clean photons @xmath21 since most of charged tracks are removed by the pc3 veto cut , the neutron and antineutron contamination is dominant and it is largest around @xmath2 of @xmath56 due to the contribution from annihilating antineutrons",
    ". then it is effectively reduced by the shower shape cut and becomes negligible above @xmath57 , which is less than @xmath58 .",
    "the comparison of the ratio of measured @xmath59 and calculated @xmath60 is essentially the same as the double ratio shown in fig .",
    "[ publishresult ] .",
    "any significant excess of the double ration beyond unity indicates a direct photon signal . @xmath61    the preliminary run4 au+au results , in fig .",
    "[ finalratio ] , show minimum bias double ratio @xmath62 by using this new @xmath7 tagging method compared with run2 published result and run4 preliminary result from conventional method .",
    "the main sources of systematic errors are the uncertainties in the @xmath32 yield extraction and the hadron contamination correction @xmath31 , which gives a final systematic error on the double ratio at the level of @xmath63 .",
    "all results agree with each other within the error bar . for @xmath64 ,",
    "the tagging method result offers a significant direct photon measurement above 1 . but for @xmath2 below @xmath56 it is still limited by systematic errors .",
    "compared with conversion methods mentioned in section  [ introduction ] it has smaller statistical error and has the ability to extend to mid @xmath2 range .",
    "with the extended statistics provided by the rhic 2004 au+au run and this new powerful techniques to extract direct photon in medium and low @xmath2 range , a significant direct photon signal can be measured and results agree with phenix published result and several other new independent methods including internal and external conversion .",
    "these promising measurement with improved systematic uncertainties indicates that for @xmath65 direct photon yield is lying above nlo pqcd expectation and suggests a possible thermal photon emission ."
