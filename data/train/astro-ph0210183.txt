    "the combination of strong submm emission and an extended ly@xmath2 cloud is somewhat surprising , given the propensity for dust to absorb ly@xmath2 photons , although it has been seen before ( chapman et al .",
    "2001 , 2002b ) .",
    "taniguchi & shioya ( 2001 ) have suggested that this phenomenon arises from an extended super - wind driven by a highly - obscured star - burst , the wind then shocks and ionizes the gas halo which surrounds the system .",
    "this model can explain several properties of these ly@xmath2 halos ( although other processes are also feasible , see chapman et al .",
    "2001 and francis et al .",
    "2001 ) and hence deserves continued investigation , in particular studying the kinematics of the extended ly@xmath2 emission around smmj17142 + 5016/#18 using an integral - field spectrograph on an 8-m class telescope to confirm the dynamical signatures of a super - wind .",
    "many of the characteristics of smmj17142 + 5016/#18 are shared with other well - studied scuba galaxies ( ivison et al .",
    "1998 , 2000a ) : a disturbed morphology , an sed dominated by dust - reprocessed radiation , spectral signatures of a narrow - line agn and extended ly@xmath2 emission . the disturbed appearance of # 18 sets it apart from the other ( typically - compact ) ly@xmath2-selected galaxies and agn around 53w002 , and suggests that , as in local ulirgs , it is the tidal disturbance of the gas reservoir within the galaxy due to a gravitational interactions which is the root cause of the enhanced activity we see ( chapman et al .",
    "yamada et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have argued that the ly@xmath2-selected galaxies around 53w002 have characteristics similar to those seen in the wider lyman - break population , suggesting that perhaps on - going major mergers are the events which set scuba galaxies apart from the broader population of star - forming systems at high redshifts .",
    "however , the presence of multiple components on 520kpc scales in @xmath111% of the lyman - break population ( lowenthal et al.1997 ) , along with the lack of significant submm emission from the majority of lyman - break galaxies ( chapman et al .",
    "2000 ) , indicate that the picture is not that simple .    although the exact trigger of the ultraluminous activity may be ambiguous , it is also true that the power source for this behavior is similarly difficult to identify .",
    "the presence of an agn in smmj17142 + 5016/#18 obviously provides the opportunity for some fraction of its far - infrared luminosity to come from agn - heated dust but , as with @xmath15 ulirgs , it is difficult to disentangle the contributions from star formation and agn - heating to the overall sed .",
    "the existence of a large mass of dust , @xmath112m@xmath7 , suggests that massive star formation has occurred in this galaxy , while the lack of x - ray detections for the general scuba population ( almaini et al.2002 ) , along with the constraints on agn luminosities from a few well - studied scuba galaxies ( e.g.  frayer et al .",
    "1998 ; bautz et al.2000 ) both hint that only rarely does the agn completely dominate the bolometric output from typical , luminous submm - selected sources . sensitive _",
    "chandra _ x - ray observations will help to resolve this issue for smmj17142 + 5016/#18 , while _ sirtf _ mid - infrared observations will be key to disentangling the contributions from the agn to the far - infrared emission from this galaxy . more generally , it is clear from the frequency of weak agn in scuba galaxies that some of the gas from the large disturbed reservoirs in these systems does find its way onto the central black hole and given the easy availability of this fuel , the relatively modest luminosity agns which result may indicate that the black holes are of comparatively low mass ( or suffer complex dust obscuration ) .    while the submm luminosity of smmj17142 + 5016/#18 sets it apart from the typical lyman break galaxy ( chapman et al .",
    "2000 ) , its relative brightness in the optical / near - infrared wavebands also distinguishes it from the other three submm sources in this field .",
    "all of these lack obvious counterparts to @xmath113 and are undetectable in our radio map , although they should be detected close to the 3-@xmath31 limit of our radio map if they follow the mean carilli & yun ( 2000 ) relation and lie at @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , if these scuba galaxies inhabit the same structure as smmj17142 + 5016/#18 they must have lower dust temperatures ( this will decrease their radio / far - infrared flux ratios , making them fainter in the radio ) and are also likely to be more obscured .",
    "we speculate that these characteristics could arise if these submm sources lack the agn which is seen in smmj17142 + 5016/#18 .",
    "alternatively , several ( or all ) of these sources could be unrelated to the structure around 53w002 and may lie at higher redshifts .",
    "unfortunately the limits placed on the sensitivity of the radio map of this region by the presence of 53w002 means that improved radio positions for these other submm sources are unlikely to become available in the near future .    from the current census of star formation activity in the structure around 53w002",
    "it appears that smmj17142 + 5016/#18 may be the dominant contributor ( at least compared to the ly@xmath2-selected population ) .",
    "we can thus estimate a crude lower limit to the star formation density in this region , taking the rate calculated above and assuming smmj17142 + 5016/#18 is the only ultraluminous galaxy in the entire structure , which conservatively contains a volume of @xmath114mpc@xmath115 ( k99 ) , giving a star formation density of @xmath116m@xmath7yr@xmath9mpc@xmath14 . even allowing for a significant contribution from the agn to the bolometric luminosity ,",
    "this is still one to two orders of magnitude higher than the mean star formation density at this epoch ( smail et al .",
    "this is a higher contrast than the 2@xmath117 over - density of ly@xmath2 emitters in this region ( several of which are also agn , k99 ) and suggests that vigorous , obscured star formation may be enhanced in the protocluster environment .",
    "finally we note that the confirmation of a luminous scuba galaxy residing in a protocluster environment strengthens their associated with the formation phase of the massive ellipticals , which dominate rich clusters at the present - day .",
    "the identification of this scuba source adds an ultraluminous infrared galaxy to the diverse zoo of galaxies inhabiting this structure at @xmath91 , which now includes an ultraluminous narrow - line agn , a powerful radio galaxy , two broad - line agn and a large population of ly@xmath2-emitting galaxies .",
    "if these various types of activity are related through a single evolutionary cycle , then environments such as that studied here may provide the best insights into the details of their relationships .",
    "we have identified the first , spectroscopically - confirmed scuba companion to a high - redshift radio galaxy .",
    "this is smmj17142 + 5016/#18 , which lies 330kpc ( @xmath118 ) and @xmath119kms@xmath9 offset in velocity from the steep - spectrum radio galaxy 53w002 at @xmath1 .",
    "the restframe optical morphology of this galaxy is strongly reminiscent of other well - studied scuba galaxies , showing merger / tidal features ( ivison et al .",
    "1998 , 2000a ) .",
    "we present an ohs near - infrared spectrum of this galaxy , which probes the restframe optical spectral properties , as well as a number of long - wavelength constraints on the form of its sed .",
    "these show that smmj17142 + 5016/#18 is a radio - quiet , narrow - line agn with a bolometric luminosity of @xmath120l@xmath7 and an inferred star formation rate of @xmath8m@xmath7yr@xmath9 .",
    "the galaxy is also surrounded by an extended emission - line halo ( seen in ly@xmath2 and h@xmath2 ) .",
    "these halos are being uncovered in an increasing number of dusty , star - forming galaxies at high redshifts and may signify the presence of starburst - driven super - winds in these systems ( chapman et al .",
    "2001 , 2002b ; taniguchi & shioya 2000 ) .",
    "these intense winds and the strong radiation fields produced by this activity will have profound consequences for the evolution of any other galaxies in close proximity to the scuba galaxies .",
    "we thank harald kuntschner and graham smith for undertaking the ingrid observations of this field , fumihide iwamuro and toshinori maihara for obtaining the ohs spectra of smmj17142 + 5016/#18 , clare jenner for help with the scuba survey and ian waddington for the nicmos imaging .",
    "we are indebted to all staff members of the subaru telescope , naoj , who helped with the ohs observations .",
    "we thank the referee for their quick and concise report .",
