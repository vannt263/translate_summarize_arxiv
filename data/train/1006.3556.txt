    "in a study using deep mid - infrared imaging , we found a very low level of star formation activity in the pipe nebula ( @xmath0  @xmath1 , 130  pc , @xcite ) , with an upper limit of only 21 candidate ysos in the entire cloud @xcite .",
    "this survey was most sensitive to young stellar objects ( ysos ) with infrared excesses and presumably in the earliest stages of evolution .",
    "a population of more evolved class iii ysos , i.e. , diskless young stellar objects without infrared excess ( e.g. , @xcite ) , if present , would have important implications for the cloud .",
    "most importantly , such a population would lead to an increased estimate of the region s star - formation efficiency and would also indicate that the molecular cloud is more long - lived than otherwise thought .",
    "class iii objects can be identified by their x - ray emission .",
    "while this technique has been known for some time ( e.g. , @xcite ) , it has been strengthened by the analysis of the chandra orion ultra - deep project which produced a statistically well defined description of the x - ray properties of ysos @xcite .",
    "furthermore , class iii objects have been studied in _ spitzer _ infrared surveys of other nearby ( @xmath2120160  pc ) star - forming regions .",
    "@xcite targeted 83 class iii sources in the taurus , lupus , ophiuchus , and chamaeleon star - forming regions at 24  @xmath3 m , detecting all 83 but identifying excesses in only 5 .",
    "@xcite also used c2d data to study 102 spectroscopically identified class iii sources in the lupus and ophiuchus regions , detecting 80% of them at 24  @xmath3 m ( 82/102 ) at a sensitivity comparable to our data and with distances of about that of the pipe . requiring mid - infrared ( mips ) as well as x - ray detections",
    "thus provides better constraints on class  iii source populations than any of these two datasets alone could provide , and we use this additional constraint in our analysis of the pipe nebula .    in this study",
    ", we first use the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) as the only available means to search the entire pipe nebula complex for x - ray  active stars .",
    "we then study three regions of particular interest using higher - sensitivity data obtained by the x - ray satellite xmm-_newton_. the latter satellite has considerably more collecting area and is sensitive to harder x - rays than rosat , allowing observations of more extincted sources .",
    "we use xmm-_newton _ to probe three prominent regions in the pipe nebula complex in more detail ; barnard 68 ( b68 ) , barnard 59 ( b59 ) , and the pipe molecular ring in the bowl of the pipe @xcite , in the following referred to as the pmr . while b59 is known to contain a cluster of ysos @xcite , the entire bowl area has been found to be devoid of protostars @xcite , even though the average extinction in that area is at levels of visual extinction higher than those of b59 .",
    "the pipe region is seen in projection against the galactic bulge , providing an enormous background source density , particularly at near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "therefore , we have to compare the density of x - ray sources inside and outside of the identified dense core population ( from @xcite ) to estimate the local density of background x - ray sources . in the following ,",
    "we use the same extinction criterion in defining the ` on - core ' regions that was also used by @xcite : these regions have a minimum optical extinction , @xmath4(sub)@xmath5  mag , in an extinction map in which a slowly varying background has been removed @xcite .",
    "we have used the same criterion in our _ spitzer _ study @xcite . for purposes other than defining the on - core regions , we use the total extinction map computed by @xcite .",
    "the pixel size of the extinction maps is @xmath6 .",
    "looking for possible class  iii objects , we select x - ray sources with 2mass counterparts in these regions , requiring @xmath7 band detections .",
    "we then use their x - ray properties as well as _",
    "irac and mips data to better characterize them . finally , to further constrain any population of class  iii sources , we combine the x - ray source selection with detections at 24  @xmath3 m from our sensitive _",
    "spitzer_-mips study @xcite .",
    "to cover the entire pipe nebula complex , we make use of the rosat all - sky survey in the form of the bright source catalogue @xcite and the faint source catalogue @xcite . the observations for this survey were carried out in 1990/91 with the position - sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) , in the energy range of 0.12.4  kev .",
    "the x - ray satellite xmm-_newton _ has observed the pipe nebula region several times .",
    "here , we analyze three particular observations , targeting the prominent extinction cores b59 , fest 1 - 457 , and b68 .",
    "the latter region was observed for 51  ksec on september 27 , 2002 ( 07:1921:00  ut , median filter , observation i d 0152750101 ) , followed by observations of the two other regions on august 29 , 2004 : fest 1 - 457 ( 06:1919:53  ut , 53  ksec , thin filter , observation i d 0206610201 ) and b59 ( 21:5310:14(+1 )  ut , 49  ksec , thin filter , observation i d 0206610101 ) . all of these observations have been processed as part of the 2xmmi catalog @xcite .",
    "note that pipeline products like spectra and light curves for all catalog sources can be downloaded from a dedicated website .",
    "the good time intervals for these observations amount to observing times of 48.2  ksec for b59 , 43.8  ksec for the pmr , and 44.8  ksec for b68 .",
    "the energy range accessible to xmm-_newton _ and used for the 2xmmi catalog is wider than the one of rosat ; it spans 0.212  kev . in the following",
    ", we mainly work with this catalog , but we have also reprocessed the data using sas 8.0.0 to subsequently run our own source detection using the sas task ewavelet .",
    "we also employ the sas task especget to produce x - ray spectra of selected sources . for this purpose",
    ", we mostly use the epic - pn data only , rather than epic - mos data , apart from the unresolved sources [ bhb2007 ] 1&2 @xcite which are so far off - axis ( @xmath8 ) that they are only detected with the epic - mos detectors .",
    "typically , spectra were extracted from areas with a radius of 25@xmath9 and similarly sized , nearby background regions .",
    "the only exception is the close pair [ bhb 2007 ] 6 & 7 , where we chose a radius of 10@xmath9 in an attempt to separate the two components .",
    "the task especget produces the corresponding ancillary response and response matrix files .",
    "spectra were finally binned with minimum bin sizes of 20 counts .",
    "fits were carried out using the ciao tool _",
    "sherpa _ , v3.4 @xcite .",
    "in order to assess the infrared spectral energy distributions of selected sources , we have performed aperture photometry on _",
    "spitzer_-irac data covering the region , most notably observation ids 5132288 , 14089472 , and 14090496 . for this purpose ,",
    "we have used pipeline pbcd data from the _ spitzer _ archive .",
    "the typical aperture radius was 3 image pixels with an annulus for background subtraction with inner and outer radii of 10 and 20 pixels .",
    "we have additionally used _",
    "spitzer_-mips data as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the area covered in our mid - infrared survey ( * ? ? ? * fig .",
    "8) contains 44 rosat all - sky survey sources , i.e. , 12 and 32 sources from the bright and faint source catalogues , respectively .",
    "the locations of these sources are shown in figure  [ fig_rosat ] , overlaid on an extinction map of the pipe nebula . given typical @xmath10 positional uncertainties of @xmath11 , it is nearly impossible to reliably identify near - infrared or optical counterparts to rosat x - ray sources in this region with its high density of background sources , simply due to confusion . while this is somewhat easier at mid - infrared wavelengths due to the lower source density in this wavelength range , all 36 sources whose 3@xmath12 error circles are located entirely within the mips source detection coverage have one or more mid - infrared counterparts at 24  @xmath3 m .",
    "eight additional sources have error circles that only partly overlap with the area where mips source detection was performed .",
    "note that the error circle of only one rosat source ( 1rxs j173319.3255416 ) overlaps with the on - core regions and all but two of the sources have zero extinction in the extinction map where the extended structure has been removed ( see above ) .",
    "their median total extinction is @xmath13  mag . correlating the source list with catalogs using simbad shows that two of these rosat sources have been identified as x - ray binaries , two as hipparcos stars ( at 54 and 149  pc , respectively ) and one as an rs  cvn binary .    to assess the completeness of the rosat all - sky survey for our purposes , we determine the limiting unabsorbed x - ray luminosities for different levels of foreground extinctions .",
    "the limit of six source counts in the faint source catalog corresponds to a limiting count rate of 0.02s@xmath14 with the typical exposure time of 300s in this area .",
    "we can now simulate x - ray sources with a given spectrum to find the limiting unabsorbed x - ray fluxes and in turn the luminosities corresponding to this count rate limit . using the portable , interactive multi - mission simulator ( pimms , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we determine such unabsorbed x - ray luminosities for sources using simulated raymond - smith thermal plasma spectra with temperatures of @xmath15  mk . while the median total visual extinction from our extinction map for the 44 rosat sources is @xmath162.4mag , we calculate the limiting luminosities also for @xmath160,5 , and 25  mag , the maximum of our total extinction map ( which constitutes only a lower limit for the actual maximum extinction in the cluster ) .",
    "the visual extinctions can be converted into absorbing hydrogen column densities using the empirical relation @xmath17[@xmath18@xmath19[mag ] ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . conservatively assuming a plasma temperature of 1  kev ( e.g. , *",
    "* ) , the limiting luminosities are log(@xmath20)=29.5 , 30.2 , 30.7 , and 32.3ergs@xmath14 for the given visual extinctions ( in rising order ) , assuming a distance of @xmath21pc .",
    "note that the high - extinction regions cover only a minute fraction of the complex .",
    "we can now make use of the cumulative x - ray luminosity distribution functions derived for the pms population of the orion nebula cluster @xcite , to assess the completeness of the rosat data for g , k , and m pre  main - sequence stars .",
    "the limiting unabsorbed x - ray luminosity that we have determined for the median foreground extinction of @xmath13mag corresponds to a completeness of @xmath22% for g and k stars and @xmath23% for m stars . for @xmath24mag ,",
    "the completeness diminishes to @xmath25% for g and k stars and close to zero for m stars while without foreground extinction , the numbers are @xmath26% completeness for g and k stars and @xmath27% for m stars .    a significant subset of the selected rosat sources can be expected to be located in the galactic bulge against which the pipe nebula is projected , to be of extragalactic nature , or to be in the foreground . to assess this aspect , we determine the source density in the pipe and in neighboring regions ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_rosat ] ) .",
    "the overall rass source density in the region covered in our mid - infrared survey , where we find 44 rass sources , is 3.29 sources per square degree .",
    "however , it turns out that the rass source density in the pipe nebula is _ lower _ than in the immediately surrounding regions .",
    "our pipe nebula total extinction map covers nearly 49 square degrees which is about 3.7 times more than the area covered in the mid - infrared survey ( see figure  8 in @xcite ) .",
    "this area contains a total of 199 rass sources . in the immediate surroundings of the high - extinction regions inside the infrared survey area ,",
    "we thus find a rass source density of 4.37 sources per square degree .",
    "this source density is a good measure of the contaminant source density in this region since the median total extinction of the rass sources inside the infrared survey area ( @xmath13  mag ) and the median extinction for rass sources in the remainder of the area covered by the extinction map ( @xmath28  mag ) are very similar . extrapolating from the source density in the surroundings",
    ", we would expect to find 58.4 sources in the infrared survey area , but we only find 44 of which six are known to be unrelated to the pipe nebula .",
    "the poisson error ranges of these two numbers do not overlap .",
    "it appears likely that the source density in the pipe nebula is lowered by the partial extinction of a distribution of background sources , for example in the galactic bulge or extragalactic sources , by the molecular cloud .",
    "this effect is difficult to quantify since it depends on the intrinsic source spectra , e.g. , on whether a given class of sources is rather soft and therefore more susceptible to extinction .",
    "however , while in our total - extinction map of the pipe nebula and its surroundings , 11.5% of the pixels are of extinctions @xmath29  mag , only 6.8% of the rass sources in the same area are affected by the same amount of extinction , as derived from the same extinction map , consistent with a picture in which we do not detect the most heavily extincted sources .",
    "without sufficient information about optical or infrared counterparts , we can only make use of the x - ray source properties for further characterization .",
    "for the rosat sources , leaving aside the potentially variable count rates , these are primarily the two standardized hardness ratios hr1 and hr2 @xcite , ranging from 1 to + 1 .",
    "similar to , e.g. , infrared colors , the hardness ratios provide a crude characterization of spectral properties in the absence of actual spectra .",
    "the second ratio probes harder x - ray emission within the rosat band than the first hardness ratio . however , among the 44 rosat sources selected here only six have hardness ratios hr1 and hr2 with errors of @xmath30 .    in order to judge even these few hardness ratios",
    ", we need a reference region .",
    "since the taurus star - forming region is of about the same size , mass and distance as the pipe nebula , we compare our sample with a correlation of taurus pms stars and the rosat all - sky survey , using the listing of all known taurus pms stars by @xcite .",
    "while this list is not complete , it provides us with a representative comparison sample .",
    "conservatively using 2@xmath12 error circles errors would yield 24 sources , while a 3@xmath12 search radius yields 56 sources .",
    "the median 2@xmath12 search radius is @xmath31 .",
    "] , there are 46 rass sources encompassing at least one pms object from this taurus list .",
    "this overall number of sources is similar to the results of the rosat taurus survey by @xcite . out of these 46 sources ,",
    "29 have hardness ratios with reasonable errors @xmath30 . in fig .",
    "[ fig_rosat_2 ] , we show a plot of the two hardness ratios for the pipe and the taurus samples .",
    "while the latter sources delineate the same region of the diagram that @xcite found to be occupied by class  ii and iii objects , only about half of the pipe sources are in that region , although the overall numbers are very low .",
    "unfortunately , pms objects are not the only source class with predominantly positive hardness ratios : x - ray binaries fall onto the same area of the hardness ratio diagram ( e.g. , @xcite ) . to show only one example : while both the only rosat source in the on - core region and the brightest rosat source in our sample have hr1=hr2=1 , the latter is a previously known x - ray binary that is unrelated to the pipe nebula . as a further complication , the intrinsic hardness ratios of background sources are affected by foreground extinction .",
    "the hardness ratios therefore do not provide significant further constraints for our purposes .    in summary ,",
    "the rosat source density in our pipe nebula mid - infrared survey area is lower than in the immediate surroundings ; 39 of 44 sources remain unidentified .",
    "the on - core regions contain at most a single rass x - ray source .",
    "of all 44 sources , their median total extinction is @xmath162.4mag , only six have hardness ratios of sufficient quality to compare them to taurus pms objects , and only about half of them fall onto the same region of the hardness diagram as the taurus sources , even though that parameter space of hardness ratios is not unique to pms sources .",
    "we conclude that likely _ none _ of the rass sources located toward the pipe nebula are class iii ysos . to substantiate this result",
    ", we take a deeper x - ray look at three high - extinction regions in the pipe nebula using xmm-_newton_.      as noted above , all of the xmm-_newton _ observations considered here have been processed as part of the 2xmmi catalog @xcite .",
    "we use this catalog to search for x - ray sources with 2mass-@xmath7 band counterparts , particularly in the on - core regions .",
    "mips and irac data allow us to subsequently study the seds of identified sources in more detail .",
    "only one rosat source is located within the fields of view of the three xmm-_newton _ observations ( 1rxs  j172236.0235938 near the southern edge of the b68 field ; it is compatible with the position of a 2xmmi source ) .      in a first step ,",
    "we exclude low - quality detections from the x - ray sources listed in the 2xmmi catalog for the three different observations . after a visual check ,",
    "we exclude five sources listed as likely spurious .",
    "out of 297 initially listed sources , this leaves 292 .",
    "only a minor filtering of detection likelihoods has been applied ; we conservatively use a minimum detection likelihood of srcml=8 , as provided by the 2xmmi catalog ( where the minimum detection likelihood reported is srcml=6 ) .",
    "we exclude 17 sources that were detected as extended objects , identified by their catalogued extension likelihood .",
    "these two steps of filtering leave 251 x - ray sources .",
    "the distribution among the three observations is as follows : 112 of these sources are located in the field of view of the b68 observation , 101 in the field of b59 , and 38 in the pmr",
    ".    any list of x - ray detections will likely include background sources in the galactic bulge , and we note that the three fields covered by _",
    "xmm_-newton cover a total of 43704 2mass sources .",
    "we therefore again separate parts of the analysis into on - core and off - core regions .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the on - core regions cover different fractions of the three fields of view .",
    "while these fractions are 49% and 39% for b59 and the pmr , respectively , only 14% of the b68 field of view consists of on - core regions .",
    "the average total extinction in the three fields of view , as measured in our total extinction map , is highest in the pmr ( @xmath32  mag ) , followed by a similarly extincted b59 ( @xmath33  mag ) and a quite different b68 area at only @xmath34  mag .",
    "in contrast to the other two regions , there is virtually no extinction surrounding the b68 core .",
    "these basic properties of the three fields as well as results of the subsequent analysis are summarized in table  [ tab_2xmmi_sel ] .    among the x - ray properties ,",
    "we only make use of the x - ray count rates in the following .",
    "the significant extinction influences the intrinsic hardness ratios of background sources so that hardness ratios from reference regions can not be directly applied . as we have seen in the discussion of rosat data , it is nearly impossible to identify pms objects based on their x - ray hardness ratios alone .",
    "therefore , the x - ray hardness ratios provided by the 2xmmi catalog do not allow us to constrain source classes .      in a second step in our search for candidate class  iii sources , we only select x - ray sources with 2mass counterparts and , more specifically , @xmath7-band detections .",
    "to define a cutoff @xmath7 band magnitude , we use the fact that 90% of the unique 2mass counterparts to the taurus pms sources listed by @xcite have @xmath35  mag , using all cases where the source is within the 3@xmath12 2mass error circle . while the source density in the pipe nebula region is very high due to its projection against the galactic bulge",
    ", we can thereby at least eliminate some x - ray sources without sufficiently bright nir counterparts .",
    "note that the total number of 2mass sources fulfilling this @xmath7 band cutoff criterion is still 7630 for the three pointings .",
    "for every 2xmmi source selected thus far , we have extracted the x - ray positions corresponding to the three observations that we consider and we look for 2mass counterparts in the 3@xmath12 error circles as quoted by the 2xmmi catalog or @xmath36 , depending on whether an acceptable astrometric correction was obtained . among the datasets considered here , the smaller error applies only to the b59 observation .",
    "the infrared counterparts of two known ysos in b59 , imaged as bright sources at large off - axis angles ( @xmath8 ) and including one potential unresolved double x - ray source , lie just outside the total 3@xmath12 error circles as listed in the 2xmmi catalog .",
    "we therefore assume a systematic error of @xmath37 for b59 instead of @xmath38 . ] .",
    "the radius of the median 3@xmath12 error circle is @xmath39 where the values range between @xmath40 and @xmath41 . starting with the list of 251 x - ray sources , we thus find 46 x - ray sources with 2mass counterparts of @xmath35  mag .",
    "one of the sources has two suitable 2mass counterparts in the search radius in which case we choose the one closer to its x - ray position .",
    "note that the positions of 10 out of these 46 x - ray sources are also compatible with weaker 2mass sources .",
    "given the high 2mass source density in the target regions , we can now assess the possibility of chance alignments , i.e. , the number of 2mass sources above our @xmath7 band cutoff that we would find if both the x - ray search areas and the 2mass sources were randomly distributed across the fields of view . a summarized in table  [ tab_2xmmi_sel ]",
    ", we would globally expect about 17 of the 46 selected sources to be chance alignments .",
    "not differentiating between on- and off - core regions , only the number of selected sources in the b59 and b68 fields is significantly above the expected number of such chance alignments .    to find out whether any of the 46 selected x - ray sources with near - infrared counterparts , including the subgroup of 13 sources in the on - core regions , have spectral energy distributions indicative of their yso status , we have obtained _ spitzer _ mid - infrared aperture photometry for these sources , using the four irac bands in addition to our previously discussed mips 24@xmath3 m data . while any candidate class iii sources might simply show photospheric seds , we here primarily look for previously missed excess sources .",
    "all selected x - ray sources in on - core regions and most in the off - core regions were covered in all irac bands and at 24  @xmath3 m and 70  @xmath3 m ( mips ) .",
    "apart from the known ysos , all x - ray sources with nir counterparts and _ spitzer _ photometry were subsequently fitted using the online sed fitter by @xcite to check both yso models and extincted stellar photosphere fits .",
    "the model fits reveal that all but one of these sources have seds that can be reasonably explained by stellar photospheresm flux is significantly brighter than photospheric ( the source is undetected at 70  @xmath3 m ) .",
    "this source is outside of , but close to the pmr on - core region . ] .",
    "the extinction derived from these sed fits is , in most cases , lower than the estimate based on the extinction map by 12  mag , indicating that the objects are located inside the cloud . in the case of source 5 ( 2xmmi  j171117.5272535 ) , the sed fit requires an extinction of only @xmath42  mag while the corresponding pixel of the extinction map indicates @xmath43  mag .",
    "a fit to the x - ray spectrum supports a low absorbing column density upper limit for the extinction of @xmath44  mag , using the above - mentioned conversion . ] , as do the soft hardness ratios of this source , as catalogued .",
    "this source , therefore , probably is a foreground star .      to better constrain potential candidate ysos ,",
    "we can apply a lower limit to the x - ray fluxes , knowing that x - ray counterparts to any ysos would be relatively bright x - ray sources , at least in extinction - free regions .",
    "we thus exclude all sources with unabsorbed x - ray fluxes that are lower than those derived from the x - ray luminosities of 90% of the orion pms m - stars @xcite , i.e. , @xmath45 ergs@xmath14@xmath46 . in order to determine the unabsorbed x - ray flux for a given source",
    ", we use pimms to convert the total count rate ( 0.212kev ) , conservatively assuming that the spectrum is thermal plasma emission that can be explained by a 1  kev apec model and the extinction from the total extinction map . using this criterion",
    ", we can exclude nine low - extinction ( and off - core ) objects of the 14 sources in the b68 field , reducing the sample to a total of 37 x - ray sources with 2mass counterparts .",
    "the x - ray sources in the surroundings of the b68 core appear to be unrelated to the cloud .    of these 37 sources ,",
    "23 sources are located in the b59 field , 9 in the pmr , and 5 in the b68 field .",
    "a view of the three x - ray datasets and the selected sources is shown in figures  [ fig_xmm_b59 ] , [ fig_xmm_pmr ] , and [ fig_xmm_b68 ] . among these",
    "are 13 sources in the on - core regions of b59 ( 12 ) and the pmr ( 1 ) , with none in the on - core regions of the b68 field .",

    "the difference between b59 and the pmr is striking , given that both are comparable in overall extinction and amount of on - core regions covered .    among the 13 x - ray sources with 2mass-@xmath7 counterparts in the on - core regions of b59",
    ", there are 7 previously identified ysos from @xcite , not differentiating [ bhb2007 ] 1 and 2 which are unresolved in the xmm-_newton _ data due to the large off - axis angle .",
    "additionally , [ bhb2007 ] 7 appears to have a weak x - ray counterpart that is not listed in the 2xmmi catalog , but was identified in our wavelet source detection .",
    "one x - ray detected yso  [ bhb2007 ] 20  is located outside of the on - core region , and the deeply embedded protostar [ bhb2007 ] 11 , while x - ray  detected , is filtered out due to its weak 2mass counterpart . in the innermost ,",
    "most deeply embedded part of the _ spitzer_-identified young cluster @xcite , no new candidate members were detected .",
    "however , a 2mass source south of [ bhb2007 ] 6 and 7 ( not among the identified ysos ) was found to have a weak , soft x - ray counterpart .",
    "the x - ray properties of the known ysos in b59 are discussed in more detail in section  [ sec_b59 ] .",
    "since we undoubtedly again detect background sources in the galactic bulge next to putative sources in the cloud as well as foreground sources , we again analyze the density of x - ray sources in the on - core and the off - core regions . in b68 ,",
    "all x - ray sources with nir counterparts lie in off - core regions ; this is not the case in b59 and the pmr . in the absence of a class  iii source population in the pipe region",
    ", we would expect to find a source density that is lower than or equal to the source density in the off - core region due to the additional extinction . in b59 , with its known cluster of ysos , we find that the source density in the on - core regions is indeed slightly higher than the source density in the surrounding off - core regions ( 52% of the x - ray sources with nir counterparts lie in the on - core regions which cover 49% of the field of view ) . in the pmr , in striking contrast , we find that only 11% of these sources are in the on - core regions even though these cover 39% of the field of view .",
    "note that the source density in b59 turns into an underdensity without the counterparts of known ysos .",
    "this comparison of x - ray source densities in the on - core and off - core regions shows that there is no indication for a significant , previously unknown population of pms objects .    in the on - core regions of the xmm-_newton _ observations",
    ", we therefore find an upper limit of 6 new evolved ysos since this is the number of x - ray sources with appropriate @xmath7-band counterparts , not counting the known ysos .",
    "however , the fact that the two regions with any detections in the on - core regions , b59 and the pmr , both show underdensities with respect to the surrounding background source densities ( not taking into account the known ysos in b59 ) suggests that a more realistic upper limit is closer to zero .",
    "a more stringent upper limit results when additionally requiring detections at 24@xmath3 m , assuming that this selects @xmath47% of the class  iii sources ( @xcite , see above ) .",
    "apart from the known ysos , only two x - ray sources with @xmath7-band detections in the on - core regions have 24@xmath3 m counterparts , both of them in b59 , suggesting an upper limit of only a handful of class  iii sources . the combination of the three selection criteria ( 2mass , x - ray flux , and mips detection ) selects at least two thirds of any class  iii population",
    ".    finally , we can additionally give strict upper limits for any evolved yso population in the three entire fields to account for any more distributed populations .",
    "for this purpose , we can not treat the off - core source density as entirely unrelated to the cloud .",
    "while we have found that all sources in the b68 and ring fields can be explained by a combination of chance alignments and weak background sources , there are 23 selected x - ray sources in the b59 area when only 3.5 would be expected from chance alignments . subtracting the expected number of chance alignments and the number of known ysos among the selected sources ( 7 ) , we derive an upper limit of @xmath48 new candidate ysos in the entire b59 xmm-_newton _ field .",
    "note that among the selected sources , the field contains six detections at 24  @xmath3 m apart from the known ysos , again suggesting a more modest upper limit for any additional more evolved ysos .",
    "these sources would be in addition to the upper limit of 15 previously known candidate ysos in b59 @xcite .",
    "in addition to the analysis in the previous section , which focused on finding candidate ysos other than the ones already known from mid - infrared imaging , we now take a more detailed x - ray look at the sample of ysos identified by @xcite , using _",
    "it turns out that half of their sources have x - ray counterparts ( table  [ tab_brookex ] ) .",
    "note that [ bhb2007 ] 1 and 2 are far off - axis in the xmm-_newton _ data and detected as a relatively bright unresolved x - ray source . as corroborated by near - infrared spectroscopy ( covey et al .",
    "2010 , _ subm . _ ) , sources [ bhb2007 ] 5 and 17 probably are background giants and remain undetected in x - rays .",
    "the sources [ bhb2007 ] 3 , 4 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , and 19 remain undetected in x - rays as well .",
    "while [ bhb2007 ] 3 , 4 , 12 , and 19 are located in chip gaps of the epic - pn detector , they are covered by the two mos imaging detectors . while the sources may be hidden by higher foreground extinction",
    ", they could also be the lowest - mass members with the lowest x - ray luminosities .",
    "the fact that we detect one of the most deeply embedded sources , [ bhb2007 ] 11 , indicates that high extinction may not be the dominant reason for these non - detections .",
    "as listed in table  [ tab_brookex ] , nine sources have sufficient x - ray counts on the epic - pn chip to warrant a closer look at their x - ray spectra .",
    "fits to these spectra were obtained using absorbed single - temperature apec hot - plasma emission in _ sherpa _ with a fixed setting of the metal abundances to 0.3 times the solar value .",
    "the spectra can be reasonably well fitted with such a model setup and the derived plasma temperatures are on the order of several 10@xmath49  k. the derived absorbing column density can be empirically translated into magnitudes of visual extinction ( see section  [ sec_rosat ] ) .",
    "the resulting values indicate extinction at levels consistently and considerably lower than the values derived from the extinction map ( see table  [ tab_brookex ] ) . however , while the extinction map traces the entire extinction along the line of sight toward the background sources , the x - ray extinction measures the extinction toward the respective source .",
    "this indicates that the detected sources are located toward the front of the cloud and the undetected sources may indeed be hidden by higher foreground extinction .",
    "we have also extracted x - ray light curves for these sources .",
    "[ bhb2007 ] 9 , 13 , and 16  all located in the inner cluster  show conspicuous flares , likely of coronal origin , corroborating their classification as ysos .",
    "we note that two of the brightest x - ray sources in the b59 field , with more than 3000 counts each , are located in the off - core area .",
    "these are 2xmmi j171149.9272050 and 2xmmi j171214.1272140 . both have optical , near- and mid - infrared ( irac ) counterparts , and the latter source has a 24@xmath3 m counterpart .",
    "their seds look like stellar photospheres ( unextincted for 2xmmi j171149.9 and @xmath50  mag in the case of 2xmmi j171214.1 ) , even though the 24@xmath3 m point of xmmi j171214.1 falls below a fit .",
    "compared to extinction map estimates @xmath51  mag and @xmath52  mag , the low extinction as derived from the seds indicates that the sources are located in front of the cloud .",
    "the effective temperatures derived from the sed fits are on the order of 3500  k , i.e. , these sources might be active m dwarfs .",
    "2xmmi j171149.9 shows two flares in its x - ray lightcurve , indicative of coronal activity , while 2xmmi j171214.1 only shows slow variation .",
    "the x - ray spectra of both sources indicate very low levels of extinction , consistent with the sed results .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of 2xmmi j171214.1 can be well fitted by absorbed single - temperature hot - plasma emission while more than one component would be needed for 2xmmi j171149.9 .",
    "note that in both cases , also the x - ray to optical flux ratios would be consistent with an identification as m dwarfs .",
    "a third bright x - ray source in the southern part of the b59 field , 2xmmi j171153.2273607 does not have an optical or 2mass counterpart and is only covered in two irac bands ( 1 and 3 ) ; it is also not covered at 24@xmath3 m ( note that it seems to have a counterpart in the two irac bands ) .",
    "we have used x - ray data to probe the pipe nebula complex for signs of a population of class  iii pre - main sequence stars . such a population would have been missed by our previous work using mid - infrared excess emission to identify ysos . to survey the entire complex ,",
    "the only complete dataset is the relatively shallow rosat all - sky survey . due to the nearby location of the pipe nebula , however , the absolute sensitivity of these data is still meaningful since we would expect about half of a population of g and k pms stars to be detected .",
    "we find a deficit rather than an excess of rosat x - ray sources in the pipe nebula relative to its immediate surroundings .",
    "this finding is consistent with the x - ray population being dominated by background sources in the galactic bulge , partly extinguished by the foreground pipe nebula .",
    "only a single rosat source has an error circle that overlaps with one of the previously identified extinction cores , i.e. , at most one rosat source is associated to the on - core regions .    in a more detailed look ,",
    "we analyze three archival xmm-_newton _ pointings of prominent regions in the pipe nebula , encompassing b59 , the pmr , and b68 .",
    "we analyze the infrared seds of all x - ray sources with near - infrared counterparts ( @xmath35  mag ) in the on - core regions ( plus most in the off - core regions , limited by data availability ) and find that all sources in the on - core regions and all but one source in the off - core regions can be explained by extincted stellar photospheres . among these three observations ,",
    "the known cluster of ysos in b59 is the only region where the density of x - ray sources in the on - core regions is indeed higher than the background source density . without the known ysos",
    ", b59 also shows an underdensity of sources in the on - core region , indicating that there is no significant yso population beyond the sources that are already known .",
    "roughly half of the previously known _",
    "spitzer_-identified ysos have x - ray counterparts with typical spectra ; some show clear signs of variability .    in the on - core regions of the xmm-_newton",
    "_ observations , we have found an upper limit of 6 evolved ysos since this is the number of x - ray sources with @xmath7-band counterparts , not counting the known ysos . however , the fact that the two regions with any detections in the on - core regions , b59 and the pmr , both show underdensities with respect to the surrounding background source densities ( not taking into account the known ysos in b59 ) suggests that a more realistic upper limit is closer to zero .",
    "a more stringent upper limit results when additionally requiring detections at 24@xmath3 m .",
    "only two sources in the on - core regions of b59 and only four more sources in the b59 field fulfill that criterion .",
    "we therefore conclude from the available x - ray data that there is no indication of an extended population of class iii objects in the pipe nebula , corroborating the previously stated lack of star formation activity .                      ,",
