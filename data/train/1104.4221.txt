    "it is recognized that the corotation resonance where the rotation velocities of galactic matter and density waves , responsible for spiral arms coincide , plays an important role in the galactic evolution and the value of the corotation radius is one of the fundamental galactic parameters . in literature",

    "we propose a new approach to evaluation of the corotation radius in our galaxy .",
    "the method is based on the statistical analysis of oxygen radial distribution in the galactic disc ( notice that martin & roy 1995 and scarano et al .",
    "2010 also mentioned the importance of the corotation effects in analysis of abundance gradient in external galaxies ) .",
    "oxygen was used since it is mainly produced by sne ii which are strongly concentrated in spiral arms .",
    "hence it is the most pure indicator of spiral arms influence on the formation of radial abundance pattern in the galactic disc .    as an observed material ,",
    "we use the data on oxygen distribution derived by andrievsky et al .",
    "( 2002 a , b , c ) and luck et al .",
    "( 2003 , 2006 ) over cepheids .",
    "being bright and very young objects with precise distances , these stars give reliable information about abundances of heavy elements , close to the one in interstellar medium , in the significant part of the galactic disc .",
    "the main finding of the above papers is that the radial distribution of metallicity in the galactic disc is _ bimodal _",
    ", i.e. there is a rather steep gradient in the inner part of the disc at @xmath4 kpc and a plateau - like distribution for @xmath5 kpc and up to about 10 kpc ( the solar galactocentric distance @xmath6 kpc ) .",
    "hence , there is a bending in the slope of the distribution at @xmath7 kpc .",
    "the above fine structure in the radial abundance distribution is very important .",
    "it indicates that in the galactic disc the distribution formation is caused by some non - trivial process .",

    "they show that the bending in the slope of oxygen distribution is associated with the corotation resonance",
    ". however , in our previous papers we fitted the theory to the observations `` by eyes '' .",
    "now we propose a statistical method for the deriving of the corotation resonance location by means of analysis of oxygen distribution along the galactic radius .",

    "to fit the observations we minimize the variance @xmath13 over @xmath12 :    @xmath14^{ob}_i - [ x / h]^{th}_i)^2,\\ ] ]    here the summation is taken over all @xmath15 points of galactocentric radius where the abundances of the element were measured , @xmath16 is the number of observational data , @xmath17 is the number of the sought - for free parameters .",
    "unfortunately , @xmath8^{th}(r)$ ] can not be represented by any analytical or , at least , approximating formula .",
    "the theoretical abundance is derived as a numerical solution of a system of equations , the solution being dependent on a particular set of the free parameters . in our approach",
    ", there are 2 target free parameters ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "to find them the following method is used : we solve numerically the equations of oxygen synthesis varying the coordinates of @xmath12 - vector within some regions and compute a net of @xmath19 .",
    "after that we construct the surface @xmath20 as a function of the two free parameters and find the minimum ( @xmath21 ) which determines the best set of the sought - for parameters .    to estimate the free parameters errors the confidence region",
    "was constructed : according to draper & smith ( 1981 ) the confidence contour is determined by the intersection of the surface @xmath19 with the horizontal plane at level :    @xmath22,\\ ] ]    where @xmath23 is fisher s @xmath23-statistics and the 95% level of confidence was adopted .",
    "the equations which describe the evolution of oxygen synthesis in the galactic disc are as follows ( details see in acharova et al . 2005 and 2010 ) :    @xmath24    @xmath25    @xmath26    where @xmath27 are surface densities correspondingly for interstellar gas and stars , @xmath28 is the density of oxygen in interstellar medium , @xmath29 is the fraction of oxygen ( hence @xmath30 = log ( z / z_{\\odot}$ ] ) ) , @xmath31 is the star formation rate ( sfr ; @xmath32 , @xmath33 is a normalizing coefficient ) , @xmath34 is salpeter s initial mass function with the exponent of -  2.35 ( stellar masses @xmath35 are in solar units ) , @xmath36 is the rate of oxygen synthesis , @xmath37 is the infall rate of intergalactic gas on to the galactic disc , @xmath38 is the radial velocity of gas within the galactic disc averaged over the galactic azimuth , @xmath39 is time ( in gyr ) , @xmath40 is the life - time of a star of mass @xmath35 on the main sequence , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 is the mass of stellar remnants ( white dwarfs , neutron stars , black holes ) .",
    "the infall rate of intergalactic gas on to the galactic disc is described as @xmath44 with the radial scale @xmath45 kpc ( marcon - uchida et al .",
    "2010 ) which is an intermediate value between @xmath46 and @xmath47 kpc usually used in galactic nuclear synthesis modeling ( e.g. , naab & ostriker 2006 ; fu et al . 2009 ; schnrich & binney2009 ) .",
    "constants @xmath48 and @xmath49 are defined below .",
    "we made experiments with various abundances of the infall gas from @xmath50 to @xmath51 . in accordance with",
    "lacey & fall ( 1985 ) our final abundances weakly depend on the exact value of @xmath52 if @xmath53 .",
    "below we demonstrate the results for @xmath50 which is slightly less than the mean content of heavy elements in halo stars ( @xmath54 , prantzos 2008 ) .",
    "the enrichment rate of interstellar medium by oxygen is represented as follows : @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the mass ( in solar units ) of ejected oxygen per one snii explosion ( tsujimoto et al .",
    "1995 ) , @xmath57 is the rate of sneii events @xmath58 the factor @xmath59 describes the influence of spiral arms on radial oxygen pattern formation and is represented by the expression : @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the angular rotation velocity of galactic disc , @xmath62 is the angular rotation velocity of spiral density waves ( recall that whereas the galactic matter rotates differentially , i.e. @xmath61 is a function of @xmath10 , galactic density waves rotate as a rigid body , @xmath63 , the corotation radius @xmath0 is determined from equation @xmath64 ) , @xmath65 is the constant of the rate of oxygen synthesis , @xmath66 is a cut - off factor : @xmath67 if @xmath10 is contained between the inner and outer lindblad resonances and @xmath68 otherwise . in our computations ,",
    "we use the rotation curve based on clemens ( 1985 ) data adjusted for the scale @xmath69 kpc .    the last term in parentheses in equation ( 5 )",
    "describes the turbulent radial diffusion of heavy elements . to derive the diffusion coefficient @xmath70 we use the simple gas kinetic approximation ( mishurov et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the above system of equations may be divided into 2 groups : _",

    "ii ) _ the `` chemical '' equation ( 5 ) of oxygen synthesis .",
    "the target 2 free parameters , @xmath62 and @xmath65 , enter only the equation ( 5 ) .",
    "hence , the first group of equations can be solved independently of the last equation .",
    "therefore , the algorithm of solving the above equations is as follows .    at first step ,",
    "independently of equation ( 5 ) we solve equations ( 3,4 ) by means of lelevier method ( potter 1973 ) and find the time evolution of the radial profiles of gaseous and stellar densities , @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( simultaneously sfr , @xmath73 is derived ) . to perform this part of modelling",
    ", we have to specify a value of the time - scale of gas infall on to the galactic disc , @xmath48 , and adopt an expression for @xmath74 .",
    "after that , the constants @xmath33 and @xmath49 , entering these group of equations , are obtained by fitting the normalising conditions that at present epoch ( @xmath75 gyr - the age of galactic disc ) and solar position stellar and gaseous densities have to be equal to : @xmath76 m@xmath77 and @xmath78 m@xmath77 ( haywood et al . 1997 ) .",
    "taking into account that the part of stellar remnants is of the order of 10% of @xmath79 ( our experiments confirm this supposition ) we have that at present time and solar galactocentric distance summary density has to be about 54 m@xmath80 pc@xmath81 - a value close to marcon - uchida et al .",
    "however , below we also discuss other normalising conditions .",
    "at the second step , we solve the chemical equation ( 5 ) for a set of @xmath62 and @xmath65 ( as boundary conditions we demand that the solution has to be finite at the galactic centre and the galactic disc edge which we dispose at @xmath82 kpc ) . repeated this procedure we find the minimum of @xmath83 , hence estimate the best values for @xmath62 and @xmath65 , then compute their errors as it was described in sec .",
    "2 . at last",
    "we derive the location of the corotation resonance @xmath0 .",
    "in what follows we examine 2 limiting cases for @xmath48 : @xmath84 gyrs  _ rapid disc formation _ , and @xmath85 gyrs  _ slow disc formation_. for the radial gas flow 3 models were studied .. ]    \\1 ) no radial flow of gas : @xmath86 ( _ models m20 and m70 _ correspondingly for the above two rates of disc formation ) .",

    "in significant part of galactic radii current gaseous density distributions happen to be close to the observed ones and profiles derived by portinari & chiosi ( 2000 ) , fu et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , naab & ostriker ( 2006 ) and schnrich & binney ( 2009 ) . comparing the distributions",
    "we can not prefer a certain model only on the basis of density profile ( models m2o and m7o have holes in the galactic centre but they do not describe oxygen radial distribution well ) .    ; _ dashed - dotted line _ - for @xmath94 ; _ dashed line _ - for @xmath95 ; _ solid line _ for @xmath96 gyr .",
    "]    so , we need some additional arguments which enable us to make a choice among various scenarios of galactic disc formation .",
    "such information comes from observations : according to sancisi & fraternali ( 2008 ) and bregman ( 2009 ) current rate of total ( integrated over the galactic disc ) gaseous mass falling on to the galactic disc is of the order of 0.1 - 0.2 m@xmath80 yr@xmath88 whereas the total star formation rate is @xmath97 m@xmath80 yr@xmath88 ( robitaille & whitney 2010 ) although one can meet a higher level of sfr @xmath98 m@xmath80 yr@xmath88 ( hartmann 2007 ) .",
    "the above values may be considered as global normalisations which are complementary to the particular ones at solar position .    in table 1",
    "we give the computed total rate of forming stars , @xmath99 , and infall gas mass , @xmath100 at the present epoch . from the table",
    "one can see that only models of rapid galactic disc formation ( @xmath3 gyr ) demonstrate low current infall rate , @xmath101 m@xmath80 yr@xmath88 , and sfr at level @xmath102 m@xmath80 yr@xmath88 , the both quantities fit the above observed values .",
    "scenarios of slow disc formation ( @xmath103 gyr ) lead to greater current sfr , @xmath104 m@xmath80 yr@xmath88 , but they require the infall rate of the order of magnitude higher than that observed by sancisi & fraternali ( 2008 ) and bregman ( 2009 ) . obviously , one should be prudent in such estimates since future observations could discover such a huge amount of baryonic matter falling on to the galactic disc .",
    "but at the moment we do not have such data , at least for our galaxy .",
    ".constants @xmath49 ( m@xmath80 pc@xmath81 gyr@xmath88 ) and @xmath33 ( m@xmath105 pc gyr@xmath88 ) ; integrated rates of gas infall , @xmath106 , and star formation rate , @xmath107 ( m@xmath80 yr@xmath88 ) and minimal @xmath108 derived in various models + [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     let us look at the problem from another angle .",
    "there is a belief that star formation is mainly fuelled by the gas infall on to the galactic disc .",
    "hence , the total rates of gas infall and star formation should be close to each other in order to the interstellar gas not to be consumed due to star formation .",
    "but as we wrote above , at present epoch in our galaxy the total star formation rate is at least 5 times higher than the one of gas infall .    to explain this problem , in fig .",
    "2 we show evolution of the ratio of gas infall rate on to the galactic disc to star formation rate , @xmath109 , with time as a function of @xmath10 for 4 models . from the figure",
    "it is seen that , at each moment of time there is a region in the galactic disc where @xmath110 .",
    "this means that the interstellar gas is not fully consumed in the galaxy ( from fig .",
    "1 one can also see that the gaseous density is not equal to zero at any galactocentric radius ) .",
    "besides , as it was expected , in scenarios with gas radial inflow the region , where @xmath110 , is shifted closer to the galactic centre .",
    "indeed , gaseous density decreases with galactocentric radius , star formation rate also decreases with @xmath10 .",
    "hence , due to interstellar gas radial inflow the region with depressed star formation rate moves closer to the galactic centre and this results in the ratio @xmath109 increase .",
    "in addition gas radial inflow replenishes the inner part of the galactic disc with building material for star formation fuelling .",
    "so , as we can see , at each epoch of galactic evolution the reserve of gas forms into the galactic disc and it fuels star formation process .    . here",
    "a reserve of gas is formed for the future star formation . ]",
    "how should we change the normalisations of the current gaseous and stellar densities at solar distance in order to obtain the global star formation rate at level , say , @xmath111 m@xmath80 yr@xmath88 ?",
    "our experiments give the following results . in scenario of rapid galactic disc formation ( @xmath112 gyr ) and",
    "no gas radial inflow , gaseous and stellar densities happen to be unrealistically large : @xmath113 m@xmath80 pc@xmath81 ; @xmath114 m@xmath80 pc@xmath81 albeit the rate of gas infall @xmath115 m@xmath80 yr@xmath88 ( in case of gas radial inflow like in models `` b '' @xmath11660 m@xmath80 pc@xmath81 ; @xmath117",
    "m@xmath80 yr@xmath88 however @xmath118 keeps at very high level @xmath119 m@xmath80 pc@xmath81 ) . in scenario of slow galactic disc formation ( @xmath120 gyr ) and no gas radial inflow",
    "we have : @xmath121 m@xmath80 pc@xmath81 ; @xmath122 m@xmath80 pc@xmath81 but the rate of gas infall @xmath123 m@xmath80 yr@xmath88 is of the order of magnitude higher than the observed value ( if we take into account gas radial inflow like in models `` b '' we derive : @xmath124 m@xmath80 pc@xmath81 ; @xmath125 m@xmath80 pc@xmath81 but @xmath126 m@xmath80 yr@xmath88 again is too high ) .",
    "perhaps such situation can be implemented in some galaxies but it is not supported by observations for our galaxy .",
    "there is one additional argument in favour of rapid disc formation scenario : according to allende prieto ( 2010 ) and zasov & silchenko ( 2010 ) galactic discs were formed rapidly , at least last 8 gyr their sizes did not change significantly .",
    "despite the conclusion made in the previous section below we give the results for all the above models .",
    "so , at the next step we solve the chemical equation ( 5 ) , compute the variance @xmath13 and find its minimum which determines the best values of @xmath62 and @xmath65 ( to catch the minimum of the variance we varied @xmath62 and @xmath65 in a wide region : @xmath127 km s@xmath88 kpc@xmath88 ; @xmath128 gyr . ) .",
    "as an observed material we use the data of oxygen distribution along the galactic radius , derived over cepheids , which were averaged within bins of 0.5 kpc width ( see acharova et al . 2005 ; 2010 ) . the corresponding distribution is drawn in fig . 3 at step 0.25 kpc in the region from 5.25 up to 10 kpc ( in total , the number of observed points is @xmath129 ) .",

    "4 , we show an example of the surface @xmath132 for model m20 .     in case of m20 . for better visualisation",
    "we draw the figure `` bottom up '' .",
    "the best estimates for the parameters are : @xmath133 km s@xmath88 kpc@xmath88 ; @xmath134 gyr . ]    to estimate the errors of the sought - for free parameters , we compute the section of the above surface by the horizontal plane at @xmath135 ( see equation ( 2 ) , in our case the value of fisher s statistics happens to be @xmath136 , draper & smith 1981 ) . the section is demonstrated in fig . 5 by the shaded figure for model m20 .",
    "its ellipse - like border delineates the confidence region .",
    "the semi - axes of the ellipse give the errors .",
    "the results of variance computations are shown in table 1 .",
    "consider them in more detail .     from fig . 4 by the horizontal plane @xmath137",
    "this region determines the confidence one at probability level 95 % ( see sec .",
    "its border gives the estimate of the parameters errors : @xmath138 ; @xmath139 km s@xmath88 kpc@xmath88 . ]    first of all , by means of fisher s statistics analysis the significance of gas radial inflow inclusion into consideration can be estimated . to do that we have to compare models `` a'',``b '' and `` o '' with the ones without gas radial inflow separately for the above two scenarios of galactic disc formation .",
    "the result is as follows .",
    "_ i _ ) in scenario of slow disc formation the best model is m7b .",
    "other models have significantly higher values of @xmath108 and they are to be rejected .    _ ii _ ) in scenario of rapid disc formation two models , m20 and m2b , have the same values of @xmath140 , other ones should be rejected .",
    "however , we can not decide between m20 and m2b : the null hypothesis ( @xmath86 ) can not be rejected . in other words , in this scenario inclusion of the gas inflow is insignificant .",
    "so , below we discuss two models - m20 and m7b .",
    "let us compare them and test the null hypothesis that the corresponding variances do not differ significantly against the alternative one that they do .",
    "for this , according to martin ( 1971 ) we should check if the value @xmath141 lies in the range : @xmath142 ( @xmath143 is the significance level and we adopt that the degrees of freedom are approximately the same in the both alternatives ) . from table 1",
    "we derive @xmath144 , whereas for @xmath145 @xmath146 ( draper & smith 1981 ) .",
    "hence , the above inequality is satisfied and we conclude : the difference between models m20 and m7b is undetected statistically ( on the basis of available observational data of oxygen radial distribution and a rather simple theoretical approach ) . at the moment ,",
