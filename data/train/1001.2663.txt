    "loop quantum gravity @xcite and its symmetry reduced analog , known as loop quantum cosmology @xcite have experienced over recent years a dynamical progress . in particular ,",
    "an application of the latter to the studies of a simplest ( isotropic ) models of an early universe have shown that the quantum nature of the geometry qualitatively modifies the global picture of its evolution .",
    "namely , the big bang singularity is dynamically resolved as it is replaced by a so called big bounce @xcite which connects the current ( expanding ) universe with a contracting one preceding it .",
    "the results initially obtained numerically for the flat isotropic model with massless scalar field @xcite were shown to be general features of that model @xcite and next extended to more general matter fields @xcite and topologies @xcite as well as to less symmetric systems : anisotropic @xcite and some classes of the inhomogeneous ones @xcite . also , although the theory originates from the canonical framework , a connection with the _ spin foam _",
    "@xcite models was made through the studies of the path integral in lqc @xcite as well as the analysis of the cosmological models within the spin foam models themselves @xcite .",
    "another avenue of extensions is the perturbation theory around the cosmological solutions @xcite .",
    "the elements of its mathematical structure of lqc , which was initially formulated in @xcite , were investigated in detail @xcite .",
    "in addition to the studies performed on the genuine quantum level , there is a fast growing number of works employing a classical effective formulation of the dynamics @xcite , which often provides qualitatively new predictions @xcite .",
    "the methods of lqc were also applied , with various levels of rigor , outside of the cosmological setting , in particular in description of black hole solutions @xcite and spherically symmetric spacetimes @xcite .",
    "there exist also studies of different prescriptions within the polymeric quantization @xcite as well as of the connection between lqc and the noncommutative geometry @xcite .",
    "the effects predicted by lqc were also applied for the regularization of the cosmological models not originating from the polymer quantization @xcite .",
    "the prediction of the bounce and the existence of the branch of the universe evolution preceding it have raised an interesting question : provided that the expanding post - bounce branch is semiclassical , what can we deduce about the pre - bounce one ? does it have to be necessarily semiclassical or can it be completely dispersed and not possible to describe by any classical metric ? the preliminary studies performed in context of the simplification of lqc and presented in @xcite seemed to favor the latter possibility . however more detailed analysis performed in the framework of the so called _ solvable lqc _ @xcite have shown , that for the states satisfying quite mild semiclassicality assumptions for one of the branches the possible growth of the dispersion through the bounce is severely limited @xcite . in consequence , within considered class of the states",
    "the semiclassicality at the distant future implied the semiclassicality in the distant past @xcite .    the latter results , although firm , strongly rely on the analytic solvability of the studied model , thus are difficult to extend to the original formulation of it @xcite as well as to more general settings , for which one could not a priori exclude the loss of semiclassicality through the bounce @xcite . finding a definitive answer to the question posed above requires construction of the method , which is sufficiently flexible to be adaptable to the situations , where the analytical studies fail .",
    "we introduce such method in this article , next applying it to two simple examples of flat models with massless scalar field as the sole matter content : @xmath0 an isotropic friedman - robertson - walker universe , and @xmath1 an isotropic sector of a bianchi i model quantized as specified in @xcite . in both cases",
    "our technique allows to derive certain ( strong ) triangle inequalities involving the dispersions of ( the logarithms of ) the total volume and the scalar field momentum .",
    "the inequalities are general , valid for all the physical states admitted by the model . in the case",
    "@xmath0 they imply an exact preservation of the semiclassicality , whereas in @xmath1 an analogous result is only partial , as it does not involve all the degrees of freedom describing the anisotropic system .",
    "the treatment we introduce here is based on the observation , that the structure of the evolution operator in lqc implies that for each physical state ( in certain sense ) there exists the geometrodynamical ( wheeler - dewitt ) one , which is its large scale limit in either strict @xcite or approximate @xcite sense .",
    "furthermore in a large class of the models the structure of the physical hilbert space of each geometrodynamical theory describing the limit admits a decomposition onto equivalents of klein - gordon plane waves either incoming from or outgoing to an infinite volume .",
    "since the wdw limits of lqc states are formed out of `` standing waves '' coupling both the incoming and outgoing ones , one can perceive the lqc evolution as a scattering process , which transforms the wdw incoming state ( contracting universe ) onto the outgoing one ( expanding ) .",
    "known properties of the limit allow to explicitly determine the scattering matrix and thus to relate the properties of the incoming and outgoing states .",
    "the procedure is explained in detail in section [ sec : scatter ] through an application to the cases @xmath0 and @xmath1 listed above .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first , in sec .",
    "[ sec : frame ] we briefly introduce the main aspects of the lqc framework used to characterize considered models , as well as its wdw analog .",
    "next , in sec .",
    "[ sec : limit ] we analyze in detail the exact wdw limit of lqc states , which is next used in sec .  [ sec : scatter ] to construct the scattering picture mentioned in the previous paragraph .",
    "that picture is then employed in sec .",
    "[ sec : triangle ] to the analysis of the dispersions of the incoming / outgoing wdw states , which allows in turn to derive the triangle inequalities relating them .",
    "we also show there ( sec .  [ sec : tr - rel ] ) , that the dispersions of the outgoing / incoming components of the wdw limit equal the dispersions of a genuine lqc state in the asymptotic future and past , thus extending the inequalities to these quantities .",
    "we conclude with section [ sec : concl ] with the discussion of the main results as well as the possibilities of their extensions to more general settings . in order to make the presentation of the studies clearer to the reader , some details of the mathematical studies as well as the details of the numerical analysis used in the article",

    "is referred to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "since the considered systems are constrained ones , they are quantized via dirac program , which consists of the following steps : kinematical quantization ignoring the constraints , promoting the constraints to quantum operators and finding the physical hilbert space built out of the states annihilated by the quantum constraint . in accordance to this procedure",

    "the requirement for our theory to mimic the properties of lqg and the discreteness of the area operator @xmath48 there forces us to fix the physical area @xmath49 of this loop as the @xmath50st nonzero eigenvalue of @xmath48 , which is the unique physically consistent choice for that technique @xcite .",

    "the first step in the generalization of the model presented in previous section is an extension to the flat bianchi i model , describing the universe with the same matter content and topology , which however while being still homogeneous is not necessarily isotropic .",
    "its ( preliminary ) analysis within lqc has been initiated in @xcite .",
    "later more detailed analysis of its kinematics and dynamics was performed in @xcite and @xcite ( see also @xcite for a vacuum case ) , although the quantization prescription used there is not applicable to the noncompact cases @xcite .",

    "the consequence of the above observation is , that at least to some extent those of the aspects of the bianchi i model , which are related exclusively to the behavior of the isotropic degrees of freedom , can be investigated via an isotropic model constructed via averaging over anisotropies and equivalent to the slqc one described in sect .",

    "it was shown in sec .  [",
    "sec : limit ] that the basis functions spanning the lqc physical hilbert space admit certain wdw limits . given",
    "that one can define a wdw limit of any physical state by replacing the basis functions in with the limits @xmath150 defined via .",
    "this operation defines a relation between the lqc physical hilbert space and the wdw one , which in terms of the spectral profiles can be written as follows @xmath236 where @xmath138 spans the entire real line .",

    "they represent the universe which is , respectively , contracting to big crunch singularity and expanding from the big bang one .",
    "the entire lqc dynamics can be thus seen as the specific kind of `` transition '' between the contracting wdw universe ( represented by @xmath238 ) to the expanding one ( denoted as @xmath239 @xmath240 in consequence , looking at the evolution `` from the infinity '' ( in the configuration space or in cosmic time ) one can interpret the evolution as the process of scattering of the contracting geometrodynamical universe .",
    "the form of the limit immediately allows to write down the scattering matrix @xmath241 which form encodes in particular the fact , that the contracting universe totally `` reflects '' into the expanding one @xmath242 this picture allows to address in a quite natural and intuitive way the questions regarding the relation of the properties of the pre bounce branch ( universe in the asymptotic past ) and the post bounce one ( asymptotic future ) .",
    "in particular , we will apply it in the next section to determine how much the bouncing universe can disperse in the distant future of the bounce in comparison to the initial spread in its distant past .    when considering the above picture one has to remember that , although the lqc basis functions converge to the combinations of the wdw ones , this is not necessarily the truth for the general physical states , as the convergence of the bases is not uniform with respect to @xmath138 . nonetheless , once the attention is restricted just to the states localized with respect to the observable @xmath243 defined analogously to ( that is of the finite dispersion in @xmath138 ) the uniformity is restored and the wdw limit is defined in the precise sense .",
    "this fact is used for example in sec .",
    "[ sec : triangle - wdw ] where the expectation values and dispersions of the lqc states are related with the ones of its wdw limit .",
    "the scattering picture can obviously be constructed in the context of any lqc model in which the basis functions converge explicitly to the wdw ones , like for example the models with the positive cosmological constant @xcite or the bianchi i ones @xcite .",
    "the applicability is however not restricted just to such systems .",
    "in particular the models featuring the classical recollapse , like @xcite , in lqc admit a quasi - periodic evolution . for those models",
    "it is also possible to build a correspondence between the lqc and wdw states , since the basis elements of @xmath67 converge to their wdw analogs also there .",
    "the new difficulty in these cases is the fact that , as the spectra of the lqc evolution operators are discrete while the wdw ones are continuous , the direct analog of the transformation leads to the wdw states of the zero norm .",
    "this problem can be circumvented by introducing an appropriate interpolation of the discrete spectral profile of an lqc state .",
    "the wdw state constructed this way represents a single epoch ( between the bounces ) of the evolution of the lqc one . however , since such interpolations are not defined uniquely , there is no direct @xmath244 correspondence between the loop states and their `` limits '' .",
    "one can however choose the interpolations which reproduce the expectation values and the dispersions of the relevant observables at least approximately .",
    "this way it is possible build the wdw states well mimicking one epoch of the loop universe evolution .",
    "it happens however at the cost of relaxing the relations between the physical parameters corresponding to them to approximate ones , without explicit convergence of their values .",
    "the reason for that is two - fold :    a.   nontrivial corrections due to interpolation of the discrete spectral profile , and b.   the fact that the basis elements of the lqc physical hilbert space converge to their ( rescaled ) wdw analogs only asymptotically , thus obviously beyond the classical recollapse point .    despite this",

    "in particular this method is well suited to address the question , how the parameters ( for example dispersions ) can change between the epochs .",

    "let us define its decomposition onto the incoming @xmath247 and outgoing @xmath248 components such that the spectral profiles corresponding to them equal @xmath249 where @xmath250 is a heaviside step function .",
    "denote the subspaces of @xmath140 formed by these components as @xmath251 respectively .",
    "on each of these components one can consider an action of the observables @xmath252 defined by .",
    "their expectation values and dispersions equal respectively    [ eq : trajs]@xmath253    where @xmath254 and for any observable @xmath255 we define @xmath256 .",
    "the main question we would like to address here is whether there exists the relation between @xmath257 and @xmath258 and what is its form .",
    "the answer to the former is certainly true as the transformation unitarily maps @xmath259 in the following way @xmath260(k ) = e^{-2\\alpha(|k|)}\\tilde{\\ub{\\psi}}^+(-k ) , \\\\    & u:\\ub{\\hil}^+_{\\phy } \\to \\ub{\\hil}^-_{\\phy } , \\end{split}\\ ] ] thus the expectation values and dispersions in are related as follows    [ eq : exp - trans]@xmath261u \\rangle_{+ } , \\\\",

[ sec : phases ] .",
    "namely , by the definition of the dispersion we can bound the term under consideration via @xmath265 which is true for any value of @xmath266 . here we choose it to be @xmath267 upon that choice , applying the property of @xmath234 we can bound the left - hand side of as follows @xmath268 finally , knowing the relation @xmath269 we can express the right - hand side of via the dispersion of the wdw analog of the observable , which corresponds just to a logarithmic scalar field momentum @xmath270 , where @xmath271 .",
    "the result is @xmath272 where @xmath273 the righthand equality is here a direct consequence of the form of operator ( multiplication operator in @xmath138 ) and the transformation .",
    "one can easily see , that the role of @xmath257 and @xmath258 can be exchanged .",
    "the only modification induced by this operation will be the exchange @xmath274 . in consequence ,",
    "is supplemented by the inequality @xmath275 thus both these inequalities and can be understood as the triangle inequalities .",
    "note that to arrive to above inequalities we have not assumed any semiclassicality conditions in any epoch of the state evolution , neither we required the state to be peaked about any trajectory .",
    "the relations hold for every element of @xmath67 .",
    "it is also worth noting , that although , are formulated in terms of the dispersions of the logarithmic observables @xmath116 and @xmath276 , for the states semiclassical ( sharply peaked ) in any epoch of the evolution ( pre or post bounce ) these quantities can be approximated via analogous `` linear '' ones : @xmath277 , @xmath278    [ eq : lin - obs]@xmath279    in consequence the inequalities , can be reformulated in terms of them at least on the semi - heuristic level ( or in precise sense under certain additional assumptions imposed on the form of the state ) .",
    "this is not however the aim of the article , as we intended to find a relation which is maximally general while remaining precise .    at this point one",
    "has to be aware of an important subtlety related to the description method applied hare .",
    "namely , the considered observables are the geometrodynamical observables acting on the asymptotic states ( wave packets ) , not the exact lqc observables acting on the lqc states .",
    "therefore one may in principle worry , that due to some wild behavior of the lqc basis functions near the bounce point there might be some residual contributions to the results ( expectation values , dispersions ) of the scattering picture essentially invalidating found inequalities , once applied to exact lqc observables .",
    "on the other hand , the studies of @xcite performed for `` linear '' observables",
    "@xmath280 show , that at least for the slqc prescription the lqc dispersions indeed approach the ones of wdw limits .",
    "this suggests that the problematic corrections mentioned above are not sufficient to distort the main results .",
    "indeed , one can confirm this expectations in quite general setting using the relation of the norms of lqc state and its wdw limit derived in appendix  [ app : norms ] .      to show it let us focus our attention to just one limit , say in the distant past .",
    "due to the symmetry of the system the reasoning is immediately applicable also to the distant future one . also , since the relation is of physical interest only when @xmath281 stay finite we restrict our studies to the states @xmath65 which are localized in the weak sense , that is for which the expectation values and dispersions of the components @xmath282 of their wdw limit are finite ( for finite @xmath27 ) .    the forms , of the lqc and wdw states and the relation between @xmath65 and its limit given by and imply immediately that @xmath283 on the other hand , via the mapping these physical norms can be expressed as the appropriate kinematical norms on the surface @xmath284 , which are given by and respectively .",
    "this allows us to define the _ partial norms _ @xmath285 as the restrictions of , to those points in the domains which satisfy @xmath286 for + and @xmath287 for - respectively .",
    "consider now an arbitrary small @xmath288 and select the point @xmath289 such that @xmath290 .",
    "next define the function @xmath291 using this function as a separator we can define the _ partial dispersions _",
    "@xmath292 of the observables @xmath116 per analogy to the partial norms , that is restricting the domains of summation to the sets @xmath293 , @xmath294 respectively . in the similar way we define the dispersions @xmath295 of analogous observable acting on the state @xmath247 .",
    "they obviously sum up to the complete norms and dispersions    @xmath296    where @xmath297 is the dispersion of an observable and @xmath258 is defined via . using the known asymptotic behavior of the basis functions we can compare the limits of these dispersions as @xmath298 .",
    "let us start with @xmath299 . applying the numerical estimate and taking into account ,",
    "that the state @xmath65 is localized in @xmath278 we can write the asymptotic behavior of the wave function ( for large negative @xmath27 ) @xmath300 where the remnant @xmath301 has the bound independent of @xmath27 .",
    "this , together with the fact that the value @xmath302 depends only on @xmath303 and the convergence of the sum over the relevant part of @xmath304 and integral over the domain @xmath305 implies    [ eq : ndp - conv]@xmath306    on the other hand , the localization of @xmath247 in @xmath252 and the fact , that @xmath307 implies that @xmath308 where the right - hand side equality is the consequence of the left - hand side one and .",
    "furthermore , from that and follows @xmath309 combining together , , and , taking into account , that the part of @xmath65 contributing to the norms and dispersions is supported on @xmath310 , estimating the partial dispersion by the partial norm @xmath311 }   |\\ln|v|-\\bar{x}(\\phi)|\\ ] ] and applying we get @xmath312 this result , together with , , and finally implies @xmath313 due to symmetry of the system , repeating the above reasoning for the limit @xmath314 and the wdw component @xmath248 we obtain the convergence in the asymptotic future @xmath315 where @xmath316 is defined via .",
    "thus , provided the considered lqc state @xmath65 has finite dispersion in @xmath278 , the triangle inequalities , apply also to the asymptotic past and future limits of the dispersions of lqc states .",
    "in this article we introduced the interpretation of an evolution of a universe described via loop quantum cosmology as the scattering process of the geometrodynamical ( wheeler dewitt ) one . using this picture we analyzed certain properties of the bounce in the model of a flat isotropic universe with the massless scalar field as well as in the isotropic sector of its generalization to the homogeneous but anisotropic spacetimes ( bianchi i ) . in these cases",
    "the lqc evolution is a process of transition of an ever - contracting ( incoming ) wdw universe into an ever - expanding ( outgoing ) one per analogy with the klein - gordon wave packet coming from the infinity , interacting with the nontrivial potential and being reflected in a scattering process back to infinity .",
    "the process is described by a scattering matrix , which explicit form was found and of which properties were investigated in detail .",
    "these properties were used to compare the dispersions of the observables @xmath252  scaled logarithmic volume at given `` moment '' of a scalar field ( an internal time ) of the incoming and outgoing states .",
    "it was proved that the dispersions satisfy certain triangle inequalities ( [ eq : triangle1 ] , [ eq : triangle2 ] ) involving also the spread of the logarithmic value of a scalar field momentum @xmath317 .",
    "the derived inequalities are : @xmath0 exact and , @xmath1 general , as they hold for _ any physical state _ admitted by the model .",
    "these results were immediately extended to the infinite past and future limits of the dispersions of true observables acting on the genuine lqc states , as it was shown , that these dispersions converge in the asymptotic past and future to the appropriate dispersions of the , respectively , incoming and outgoing wdw states considered in the scattering picture .",
    "this convergence happens for every state on which the dispersion @xmath318 of @xmath278 is finite .",
    "the result reported above immediately implies that once the incoming state is semiclassical ( that is it is sharply peaked in @xmath252 and @xmath317 ) so is the outgoing one and vice versa . in consequence _",
    "any physical _ universe of finite @xmath318 semiclassical in the infinite past is also _ always _ semiclassical in the infinite future .",
    "this conclusion is a precise confirmation as well a generalization of the results of @xcite as it @xmath0 holds for any physical state satisfying just a very reasonable condition of the finiteness of @xmath318 , @xmath1 is valid also for the prescriptions different that slqc and which in particular are not exactly solvable , @xmath319 extends immediately also to the isotropic sector of the bianchi i model quantized in @xcite .",
    "in addition to confirming the robustness of the recall picture for the simplest models , the presented work constitutes the development of a new methodology , which application is not restricted to exactly solvable models .",
    "our method uses only the structure of the physical hilbert space and asymptotic properties of its basis , none of which have to be controlled analytically .",
    "the only relevant requirement for application is sufficiently good control over states in the geometrodynamical analog of the lqc model under study .",
    "this allows in particular to easy extend our studies to more complicated isotropic models admitting well defined wdw limit , for example the ones with positive cosmological constant . for such models by construction",
    "our method seems to be better suitable to investigate asymptotic behavior ( very large size ) of the universe than the ones using the hamburger decomposition @xcite , as in this regime they reach the limit of their applicability @xcite .",
    "presented methodology can be extended also to any system , in which one , while not having a good control over the large @xmath40 limit of the lqc state , one still can verify the semiclassicality preservation of its wdw analog . there , instead of comparing the incoming and outgoing components @xmath282 of the wdw limit at @xmath192",
    ", one can compare them in the limit @xmath320 , where they usually converge to the plane waves characteristic for the model we studied in this article .",
    "such comparison alone is not sufficient to give any useful information about actual dispersions in context of lqc , however it provides a controllable bridge between the wdw components .",
    "then , once we are able to control ( bound ) the growth of dispersions along the evolution of the wdw states , we can use this bridge to relate the dispersions at large @xmath40 of @xmath247 and @xmath248 .",
    "such method seems to be viable for example in the case of the universe with massive scalar field ( i.e. the inflaton @xcite ) .",
    "there , the wdw model is much easier to handle as , in opposition to the lqc one , it admits a good internal clock , evolution along which is generated by a self - adjoint operator .    in certain , less precise sense an extension can be made also in the case of the recollapsing models .",
    "there however , as in the physically interesting domain ( universe sizes not bigger than the size at the recollapse ) the wdw limit of the state only approximately approaches the genuine lqc one and the real convergence happens already for the `` tails '' of the wave function , the parameters ( like dispersions ) of the wdw limits can resemble the analogous ones of lqc state only approximately , without actual convergence .",
    "therefore any found relation between the dispersions of the components of the limit can provide analogous relation for the lqc state only at the approximate level , up to some finite corrections . to get exact relations , like the triangle inequalities derived here , the precise estimates on those corrections need to be made . on the other hand ,",
    "the presented scattering interpretation is well fit to investigate in systems featuring quasi - periodic dynamics the phenomena like spontaneous coherence in some epochs of the universe evolution .",
    "the methodology described in this article can be applied not only to the isotropic models , but also to the less symmetric ones .",
    "examples of such are bianchi i models : vacuum ones or admitting the scalar field .",
    "in particular the analysis of the latter model , quantized via the methods of @xcite and @xcite will be presented in @xcite . there",
    ", the semiclassicality preservation has a slightly weaker sense , as , due to nontrivial dispersion relation @xmath321 only the relative logarithmic observables @xmath322 have well defined finite limits as @xmath323 .",
    "the results describing the semiclassicality preservation in the vacuum case ( quantized as in @xcite ) are already presented in @xcite . there , due to subtleties related with the choice of an emergent time the analogs of triangle inequalities contain additional terms , thus the relations are weaker than in the case with the scalar field .",
