    "the calculations with the realistic forces ( paris force , argonne v14 force ) indicate that the isoscalar pairing gap in the symmetric nuclear matter is 3 times larger than the isovector one @xcite .",
    "the potential problem stems from the transition from realistic to effective interaction : the extremely strong @xmath3 pairing emerges essentially from the fact that with respect to the @xmath10 channel , dominated by the central force , the tensor force is acting additionally .",

    "an additional challenge lies in the fact that the strength of the effective isoscalar @xmath3 @xmath2-pairing is not known , and thus has to be defined by the comparison with experimental data .",

    "the isovector mean - field theory @xcite is used for the study of rotating properties of the @xmath6 nuclei in the present manuscript .",
    "this theory assumes that there is no isoscalar @xmath13pairing , but takes into account isovector @xmath13pairing and isospin symmetry conservation .",
    "the later feature , treated in strong coupling limit , is a clear advantage of this approach since it is ignored in other studies .",
    "an additional advantage is the fact that standard mean field models with only @xmath10 like - particle pairing can be employed .",
    "the basis modification of these theories lies in adding the isorotational energy term @xmath17 to the total energy . since , however , all low - lying rotational bands in even - even @xmath0 nuclei have isospin @xmath7 , this term vanishes . on the level of accuracy of the standard mean - field calculations ,",
    "the restoration of the isospin symmetry ( which takes care of the t=1 @xmath2 pair field ) changes only the energy of the @xmath8 states relative to the @xmath7 states @xcite . with this in mind , the rotating properties were studied by means of the cranked relativistic hartree - bogoliubov @xcite ( crhb ) theory .    at high spin , the impact of @xmath10 pairing is negligible and consequently it can be neglected .",
    "in such situation , the isospin broken at low spin by isovector pairing is conserved automatically @xcite .",
    "thus , the high spin ( @xmath18 ) states are systematically studied by means of the cranked nilsson - strutinsky ( cns ) @xcite and the cranked relativistic mean field ( crmf ) @xcite approaches , which assume zero pairing . the standard set of nilsson parameters @xcite",

    "which physical observables of rotating nuclei may present evidence for the existence of the @xmath3 @xmath2 pair field is addressed in the present manuscript .",
    "the size of the moment of inertia , the frequencies at which the pairs of particles align their angular momentum ( band crossing frequencies ) , deformation properties , and unexpected mixing of configurations with a different number of quasiparticles have been discussed in the literature as possible indicators of @xmath2-pairing in rotating @xmath6 nuclei @xcite .",
    "in recent experiment @xcite , previously observed bands were extended to an excitation energy of @xmath3124 mev and angular momentum of 30@xmath32 , new side band has been observed and the lifetimes of high - spin states were measured for the first time .",

    "@xcite predicted that the @xmath3 @xmath2-pairing generates such enhancement .",
    "an important aspect of this study is the fact that all theoretical calculations ( partially published in ref .",

    "the irregularities seen in @xmath37 of the band b at @xmath38 mev ( see fig .  2 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) may be explained as due to the crossing ( or interaction ) of the [ 3,3]a and [ 3,3]b configurations .    however , a number of factors favor the assignment of the [ 3,3]a configuration to the band 2 .",
    "an analysis of the relative energies of experimental high - spin bands in @xmath39kr and @xmath40br shows that they are better described in the cns calculations with the standard set of the nilsson parameters as compared with the ones employing a80 parameters .",

    "side band has been observed in ref .",
    "it is linked to the ground state band by the 1685 and 1653 kev transitions of unknown multipolarity .",

    "all observed high - spin bands would have the same parity - signature contrary to theoretical results obtained in the cns and crmf calculations which suggest the presence of near - yrast rotational sequences of negative parity ( see fig .",

    "[ kr72-qt ] compares measured transition quadrupole moments of observed bands with the ones of assigned configurations .",
    "starting from the [ 2,2 ] configuration ( band 4 ) , subsequent additions of the @xmath21 particle(s ) increase the transition quadrupole moment .",
    "this trend is seen both in calculations and in experiment .",

    "experimental data on transition quadrupole moments are also available for @xmath39kr @xcite and @xmath9rb @xcite . these data ( both absolute values and relative changes in @xmath43 ) agree reasonably well with the results of the cns , crmf , and crhb calculations ( see refs .",

    "in addition , available data on transition quadrupole moments of superdeformed rotational bands in @xmath53cu @xcite and @xmath45zn @xcite are well reproduced in similar calculations .",
    "thus , one can conclude that _ no enhancement of quadrupole deformation in the @xmath0 nuclei ( which is expected in the presence of the @xmath3 @xmath2-pairing @xcite ) as compared with the one obtained within the framework of isovector mean field theory is required in order to reproduce experiment . _",
    "the progress in understanding of @xmath2-pairing requires better knowledge of different components of like - particle pairing . the investigation of the impact of the coulomb exchange term on the pairing field , within the framework of the hartree - fock - bogoliubov approach based on the gogny force , found a considerable decrease of the proton pairing energies due to a coulomb anti - pairing effect @xcite .",

    "the similarity of the proton and neutron single - particle spectra ( apart from some constant shift in absolute energies by the coulomb energy ) in the @xmath0 nuclei leads to the fact that proton and neutron pairing energies are almost the same for proton and neutron subsystems in calculations which do not contain a coulomb exchange term ( as is the case with crhb calculations , see fig .  [ pairing ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the alignment ( paired band crossing ) of proton and neutron pairs takes place at the same rotational frequency in such calculations ( see fig .  [ coulomb ] ) , which in turn leads to only one bump in the dynamic moment of inertia .",
    "however , if the predictions of ref .",
    "@xcite are correct then the proton pairing energy should be considerably smaller than that due to the neutrons , and it is reasonable to expect that this fact will result in an alignment of proton and neutron pairs at different frequencies , which would manifest itself in a double peaked shape for the dynamic moments of inertia .    fig .",
