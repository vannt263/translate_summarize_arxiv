    "<S> [ fig : tnrlocal2](d ) , which is built by connecting together @xmath97 of the initial tensors @xmath20 into a ring . at criticality , </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of eigenvalues of @xmath2 is also given in terms of the scaling dimensions @xmath1 of the theory @xcite , @xmath98 the detailed , one - to - one relation between the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix @xmath2 , made of tensors @xmath20 , and of the transfer matrix @xmath0 , which was obtained after applying a local scale transformation to the network made of tensors @xmath20 , is a highly non - trivial manifestation of local scale / conformal invariance in the continuum @xcite , whose derivation is reviewed in @xcite section e. we regard tnr s ability to accurately reproduce this relation on the lattice as strong evidence that it has properly implemented the local scale transformation .    </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that other coarse - graining transformations , such as tensor renormalization group ( trg ) and generalizations @xcite , can also be applied locally . </S>",
    "<S> however , most of these methods do not thoroughly remove short - range entanglement , failing to explicitly recover global scale invariance at criticality @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the logarithmic local scale transformation would produce a linear map @xmath51 that depends on the scale @xmath67 and from which we can not extract the scaling operators and their scaling dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we thus conclude that the ability of tnr to correctly implement local scale transformations can be traced back to its proper removal of short - range entanglement .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we have mostly focused on a local scale transformation of the plane that leaves a puncture at the origin untouched , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : tnrlocal1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we have also briefly considered a local scale transformation that leaves two punctures untouched , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : otherlst](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> one can of course consider many other local scale transformations on the lattice . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , by leaving the whole @xmath18 axis of the plane untouched , we can map the upper half plane into the hyperbolic plane . </S>",
    "<S> this was done in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where a tensor network representation of the statistical partition function @xmath3 of a classical system in two space dimensions was converted into a multi - scale entanglement renormalization ansatz ( mera ) @xcite representation of the ground state of the dual quantum theory in two space - time dimensions .    </S>",
