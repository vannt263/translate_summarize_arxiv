    "unfortunately , the resulting equations need to be approximated .",
    "typical approximations involve the use of finite - order perturbation theory ,  @xcite where the contour - ordered negf is approximated by a finite number of diagrams ; or partial resummation schemes , like the @xmath0 approximation ,  @xcite where one class of diagrams ( or a few of them ) is `` summed to infinite order . '' since there are infinitely many such classes , each containing an infinite number of diagrams , both finite - order pt and `` infinite - order '' resummation schemes are tentative at best .",
    "furthermore the negf equations and their approximations are nonlinear integral equations which require a self - consistent solution ,  @xcite thus making their numerical solution very demanding from a computational perspective .",

    "for the sake of simplicity , we will use the fock only scba ( fock - scba ) as a prototype of self - consistent partial resummation approximation which , as illustrated in fig .",

    "nevertheless , we expect our insights to be useful for the calculation of quantities under other more involved ( but equally uncontrolled ) self - consistent resummation schemes .",
    "@xcite while pt _ per se _ is , at best , an intrinsically weakly - interacting approach , its combination with a carefully crafted analytic continuation function ( acf ) can yield accurate results far beyond the weakly interacting limit , even allowing the calculation of intrinsically non - perturbative quantities from low - order pt .",

    "a comparison with both pad approximants and standard iterators reveals that hypergeometric resummation outperforms both of these approaches . in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we discuss these results and argue that the self - consistent `` sunset '' series has a generally finite radius of convergence and that its divergence is due to a branch - cut in an abstract plane of complex values for the electron - phonon interaction strength parameter .",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the central objects  @xcite of negf formalism are the one - particle contour - ordered gf , @xmath4 , and self - energy @xmath5 $ ] .",
    "the latter is a functional of @xmath4 that takes into account the effect of interactions and , in practice , needs to be approximated .",

    "the time arguments are located on the keldysh - schwinger contour , consisting of two counter - propagating copies of the real - time axis ( the forward branch extending from @xmath11 to @xmath12 and the backward branch extending from @xmath12 to @xmath11 ) , which is the hallmark of the negf formalism . using the short - hand notation , we can also rewrite eq .   as @xmath13^{-1}\\,.\\ ] ] the dyson equation must be solved for @xmath4 and is explicitly self - consistent , thereby calling for an iterative scheme .",
    "the standard iteration proceeds as follows : one approximates @xmath14 and calculates @xmath15 $ ] to build a new approximation @xmath16^{-1}$ ] , then one approximates @xmath17 and evaluates @xmath18 $ ] . this procedure is then repeated typically according to the expression @xmath19^{-1}\\,,\\ ] ] until @xmath20 and @xmath21 ( or the relevant expectation values calculated from them ) differ by less than some prescribed tolerance .",
    "this iterative procedure does not guarantee convergence and often requires convergence acceleration schemes , such as linear and pulay mixing which typically need to be carefully combined with a preconditioning scheme like nieminen - kerker  @xcite or direct inversion of the iterative subspace  @xcite without , again , guaranteeing convergence .",
    "the appeal of self - consistent approaches over simpler forms of pt ( to be discussed below ) is based on the relationship between conservation laws and self - consistency  @xcite  it is well known that by choosing a conserving self - energy approximation , the expectation values calculated from the self - consistent @xmath4 will obey whatever conservation laws they ought to obey , i.e. the fully self - consistent @xmath4 is a conserving gf . however , as pointed out by baym ,  @xcite full self - consistency is by no means a necessary condition for conservation laws to be obeyed_a perturbation expansion in powers of the interaction strength will also be conserving at each and every order , provided that one chooses a conserving self - energy and keeps all the resulting terms at each order_.  @xcite in contrast , an approximation like @xmath22 obtained by setting @xmath23 in eq .",
    "above is therefore not conserving because it misses some of the second - order diagrams owing to the fact that the perturbative expansion for the negf is not a geometric series [ as incorrectly assumed in eq .  ] .",
    "while conserving , perturbative approximations are valid only for weakly interacting systems and break down very rapidly as the interaction gets stronger than the radius of convergence of the perturbative expansion  @xcite .",
    "thus , being `` conserving '' is not a good enough reason to choose an approximation for @xmath24 . on the other hand , as we will demonstrate , being `` perturbative '' is not a good enough reason to discard an approximation .",
    "in fact , critically reflecting on the basis of self - consistent approximations in mbpt is likely to raise some tough questions : it appears that the limit of validity of this method is , strictly speaking , identical to that of the underlying perturbation series .",
    "the reason for this is the neglect of  or the need to approximate ",
    "vertex corrections ,  @xcite which are present already at the second order in pt in the form of a first order vertex .",
    "if one measures the accuracy of an approximation by the fraction of feynman diagrams it accounts for , one readily sees that at high orders essentially all the feynman diagrams include high - order vertex diagrams .",
    "@xcite any form of self - consistent pt is an infinite - order approximation where , by including a finite - order approximation to the vertex , one is summing an error to infinite order .",
    "@xcite but @xmath24 is supposed to correct @xmath9if the error is not small compared to the correction then self - consistent mbpt is not applicable ; if it is small then a finite - order , perturbative approach is likely to be equally applicable .",
    "accordingly , we see no fundamental reason for self - consistent mbpt to be favored over simpler forms of pt  if it works its perturbation series will , most likely , also work .",
    "@xcite    nevertheless , the use of self - consistent mbpt may be justified to some extent .",
    "when a convergent self - consistent approximation is obtained it is typically _",
    "regularized _ ,",
    "i.e. , it is free from the absurdly large values that one obtains from finite - order pt outside its radius of convergence",
    ". there are also more mundane reasons  we would like to have as many approximations as possible in our toolbox .",
    "analytic continuation and resummation techniques may be very helpful in this respect because , as shown below , they may provide substantial convergence acceleration relative to state - of - the - art self - consistent solvers , which are based on the combination of eq .   with mixers and preconditioner .",
    "an alternative to eq .   is to compute the perturbation series for the negf , which is conserving if @xmath24 is a conserving approximation , and compute expectation values from it .",
    "this yields a perturbation expansion for the expectation value .",
    "the perturbation expansion for the expectation value can then be analytically continued as analytic continuation naturally preserves the conservation laws .",
    "let us begin by considering ( say ) an interacting many electron system , where the interaction is mediated by the exchange of bosons and described by the usual feynman diagrams . to each vertex at the edges of a bosonic propagator we ascribe a parameter @xmath25 which controls the interaction strength .",
    "the perturbation expansion of @xmath4 in powers of @xmath26 up to order @xmath27 is then given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the expansion coefficients that do not depend of @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , perturbative negfs are polynomials in @xmath26 , as illustrated for fock - scba in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig0 ] .    a simple expression for @xmath30 in terms of @xmath24 is @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 contains all the ( proper ) self - energy diagrams with @xmath35 bosonic lines . furthermore if , like in the case of the scba , @xmath24 is a linear functional of @xmath4 then @xmath36 $ ] : in this case it is straightforward to iterate eq .   a couple of times . for @xmath23",
    "we get @xmath37 ; for @xmath38 we get @xmath39 , and so on .",
    "clearly we are getting the full perturbative expansion ",
    "terms coming from self - consistency ( like @xmath40 ) and terms coming from @xmath1-derivability ( like @xmath41 ) . therefore , as discussed in ref .",
    ", @xmath30 is actually conserving , albeit not fully self - consistent .",
    "indeed , @xmath42 contains a finite number of diagrams , while the fully self - consistent @xmath4 contains an infinite number of them . the diagrammatic representation of @xmath43 in fock - scba is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig0 ] .    as pointed out above",
    ", one could now take the sequence of @xmath42 apply to it some sequence transformation such as pad or shanks .",
    "unfortunately , as @xmath22 demonstrates , that does not typically lead to conservation laws .",
    "instead these transformations can indeed be used as analytic continuation formulas , but on the sequence of expectation values obtained from the sequence of @xmath42 .",
    "we can view @xmath22 as the 0/1 pad approximant to the negf whose perturbation expansion is in general an unphysical geometric series that breaks conservation laws ",
    "it misses , for instance , the @xmath41 discussed above .    in negf theory ,",
    "any one - electron expectation value , @xmath44 , is a functional of the negf , @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "one can then evaluate the expectation value of an observable using @xmath42 obtained from eq .",

    "in fact , increasing @xmath27 for @xmath53 will only make things worse  the calculated expectation value either grows without bound or oscillates wildly between large negative and positive numbers .",
    "@xcite    however , sequence transformations  @xcite like the pad technique can actually accelerate convergence .",
    "for instance , given @xmath56 and @xmath57 , we can build the @xmath58 pad approximant @xmath59 as well as the 0/2 pad approximant .",
    "if instead we have the sequence of expectation values up to @xmath60 , we can build , e.g. , @xmath61 pad approximant , but the equation is too long to be written here .    it has been shown  @xcite that by buiding a pad table of expectation values one can achieve substantial convergence acceleration relative to the standard technique of calculating the sequence of @xmath62 $ ] . however , there are some clear limitations ",
    "pad resummation approximates the exact expectation value by a rational functions of @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , the denominator of a given pad approximant may vanish for specific values of the device parameters , rendering the approximation unusable and requiring the computation of higher orders in the perturbation expansion .    ultimately , the root cause of the divergence of a perturbation expansion is a singularity in an abstract plane  @xcite of complex values of @xmath25 ( the physical values are located on the real axis ) .",
    "pad approximants are able to describe the case where the convergence - limiting singularities are poles .",
    "but the singularity structure could also be a branch cut ( a dense line of poles ) , and in such cases pad approximants lack the necessary analytic structure to describe the physical @xmath25-dependence , thus converging very slowly with perturbation order . in problems where convergence is limited by a branch cut , pad approximants quite literally attempt to reconstruct the cut by putting poles next to each other .",
    "@xcite accordingly the pad sequence should converge slowly , if at all , for those cases .",
    "simple low - order approximants able to account for both branch - cut and poles should be advantageous",
    "the combination of mbpt and analytic continuation of the expectation values calculated from it is a very promising and not widely explored approach to the computation of nonequilibrium properties of quantum many - body systems .",
    "it is naturally conserving and may well be a better option than the more standard methods , based on eq .  .",
    "unfortunately , in typical sequence transformations such as shanks or pad , one approximates the @xmath25-dependence of the expectation value by a rational function of @xmath25 .",
    "therefore it is highly advisable to develop resummation techniques able to deal with both rational and non - rational functions of @xmath25 , as well as with both poles and branch cuts in the complex @xmath25-plane .",
    "here we put forward hypergeometric functions , in particular gauss @xmath3 hypergeometric function , as tools for analytic continuation of expectation values calculated from mbpt .",
    "there are various reasons for this particular choice of analytic continuation functions : they are flexible and very general , including many other functions ( such as binomials , exponentials , square roots , bessel functions , ... ) as particular cases ; they are able mimic both cuts and poles and , thus , can naturally model the two main types of convergence - limiting singularity structures ; their taylor expansions are known , allowing one to build hypergeometric approximants in a fashion akin to pad approximants .    here",
    "we discuss two possible approaches to hypergeometric resummation .",
    "we first describe the hypergeometric approximant put forth in ref .  , and then introduce an alternative approach based on the ratio test of series convergence . in the first case",
    ", we seek approximations of the form @xmath63 while in the second case , one is lead to approximations of the form @xmath64 here @xmath65 and @xmath66 parameters are to be determined from the perturbation coefficients for @xmath44 , in a way that is fashioned after pad resummation , by equating order - by - order the taylor series for the hypergeometric approximants with the perturbation expansion for the observable . fixing the parameters of both of these hypergeometric approximants",
    "requires four orders of pt .",
    "thus , in the former approach one needs to determine the coefficients @xmath67 , while in the latter one needs the first order correction @xmath68 , as well as the next three corrections , @xmath69 , in order to determine @xmath70 .",
    "let us commence by recalling the construction of the hypergeometric approximant in ref .  .",
    "first , the perturbation series for the expectation value of the observable under consideration is normalized by dividing it by its unperturbed value @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "the taylor series for @xmath73 is @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a so - called pochhammer symbol , defined in terms of euler gamma function . to obtain the @xmath65 that determine the hypergeometric approximant ,",
    "one equates each order in the asymptotic series for @xmath3 with the corresponding term in the perturbation expansion for @xmath44 , resulting in a set of four ( non - linear ) equations with four unknowns @xmath67 @xmath76 because the equations are non - linear , multiple solutions are possible . in the numerical example given below , however , two solutions were found , corresponding to the same hypergeometric function ( see also ref .  ) .",
    "once the @xmath65 have been obtained one has a hypergeometric approximant of the form given by eq .  .",
    "the hypergeometric function plays the role of a @xmath25-dependent multiplicative factor which modulates the non - interacting expectation value bringing it , hopefully , in close agreement with the interacting result .",
    "another flavor of hypergeometric resummation is inspired by the ratio test of series convergence . a useful way to know in many instances whether a series converges or not is the ratio test  one just needs to look at the ratio between consecutive expansion coefficients in the perturbation series for the expectation value , @xmath77 .",
    "if the ratio goes to a finite constant as @xmath78 then the radius of convergence is not zero .",
    "let us then assume the radius of convergence to be not zero and approximate the ratio @xmath79 between consecutive coefficients by a rational function  a diagonal pad approximant @xmath80 here the coefficients @xmath81 and @xmath82 are to be determined from pt by calculating @xmath79 for @xmath83 and solving the resulting equations for @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",

    "this technique is computationally much more efficient than standard iterators or resummation based on widely used pad approximants . in this section",

    "this observation can be substantiated by means of feynman diagram counting argument insired by ref .  .",
    "to understand hypergeometric resummation , it is useful to imagine that the electron - boson interaction strength @xmath25 is a complex parameter with both real and imaginary parts . in our example",

    "the perturbation expansion for @xmath192 converges inside a circle @xmath193 and diverges in the annulus @xmath194 , where @xmath50 can be zero .",

    "pad approximants are able to account for poles , but they are not well - suited to mimic branch cuts , unless one computes them to very large order . in pad resummation branch cuts are replaced by a string of poles .",
    "the higher the order of the pad approximant , the larger the number of poles used for the description of the branch cut and infinitely many poles are needed to precisely reproduce a branch cut . in contrast",
    "gauss @xmath3hypergeometric functions have a built - in branch cut , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fig6](a ) and  [ fig : fig6](b ) , and are also able to model poles .",

    "[ fig : fig6 ] we show imaginary part of the current @xmath195 $ ] in the complex @xmath25 plane , as given by both hypergeometric approximants and the 1/1 and 2/2 pad approximants .",
    "clearly the hypergeometric approximants have a branc cut along the imaginary-@xmath25 axis , while the pad approximants have poles along the imaginary axis .",
    "the imaginary part of the hypergeometric approximants changes its sign discontinuously across the imaginary-@xmath25 axis .",
    "in contrast , pad approximants do not have the ability to model branch cut , but instead accumulate poles along the imaginary axis as more orders of perturbation theory are used .",
    "therefore when the convergence - limiting singularity is a branch cut , pad approximants require many more orders of perturbation theory to be as accurate as fourth - order hypergeometric resummation .",
    "it should be noted that so far we have been able to infer the presence of the branch cut in @xmath192 _ a posteriori _ through comparison with the fully self - consistent solution .",
    "one naturally wonders whether it would be possible to infer the presence of the branch cut _ a priori_. to see this we apply a counting argument , originally put forth in ref .",

    "hypergeometric approximants are very flexible functions able to adapt to both cuts and poles .",
