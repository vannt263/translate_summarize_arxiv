    "baados , silk and west pointed out that a rapidly rotating black hole may act as a particle accelerator to arbitrarily high energy  @xcite .",
    "we call this acceleration mechanism the baados - silk - west  ( bsw ) mechanism or bsw process .",
    "there are several discussions on the bsw process  @xcite . from a purely relativistic point of view",
    ", it is suggested in  @xcite that an arbitrarily high energy collision induced by the bsw process implies that an extremal kerr black hole is linearly unstable .",
    "if we consider the free - fall test particles with an arbitrarily small mass from the far region , we expect that the gravity induced by those test particles will be well described by a linear perturbation around the background spacetime .",
    "if one of the test particles has the fine - tuned angular momentum for given energy such that the bsw process works well , an arbitrarily high energy particle collision can occur near the horizon . in principle , the center of mass  ( cm ) energy can be as large as the mass energy of the background black hole , where such intense gravity can not be described by a linear perturbation around the background black hole .",
    "thus , it seems that we can construct a perturbation which can be described by a linear perturbation around an extremal kerr black hole initially , but it can not be after time evolution , so that an extremal kerr black hole is linearly unstable .",
    "recently , it is shown that the second - order derivative of a test field on the horizon of an extremal black hole blows up in late times if the test field has a nonzero value on the horizon as an initial condition  @xcite .",
    "unlike in the case of a nonextremal black hole , the test field can stay on the horizon for a long time and grow up . in this sense",
    ", an extremal black hole has an instability on the horizon .",
    "we would like to point out that there are some analogies between these two instabilities , both of which imply that the extremal black hole horizon is linearly unstable .",
    "first , it seems that both phenomena come from the vanishing surface gravity of the extremal horizon . in this case ,",
    "an observer on the horizon does not feel gravitational force , and hence a particle or a field can stay in the vicinity of the horizon .",
    "note that it is essential for the bsw process that there exists a geodesic particle which stays in the vicinity of the horizon .",
    "next , a wave with sufficiently short wavelength behaves like a test particle .",
    "so , there should be a natural analogy between the dynamics of test particles and test fields .",
    "therefore , we suggest that there is a close relationship between the bsw process and the instability of fields on extremal black holes .",
    "according to the previous works  @xcite , for an arbitrarily high energy particle collision to occur by the bsw process , we need to impose at least two conditions : ( i ) the black hole horizon is extremal and ( ii ) the parameters of either of the two colliding particles are fine - tuned .",
    "we can derive these two conditions by imposing that a particle can asymptote to the event horizon in infinite proper time .",
    "the condition ( ii ) is known as the critical particle condition which is a relation among energy , angular momentum and electric charge of the particle  @xcite . since both the radial velocity and the acceleration of such a particle asymptote to zero",
    "as it approaches the horizon , i.e. , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the proper time of the particle and @xmath2 is the radius of the horizon , we might regard this condition as `` force balance '' conditions in an approach to the horizon .",
    "it is proposed that the critical particle condition can be naturally realized if we consider an innermost stable circular orbit  ( isco ) particle . in the case of a near extremal kerr black hole ,",
    "the radius of the isco is close to the horizon and such a particle satisfies @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the vicinity of the horizon which is similar to the conditions  ( [ eq : forcebalance1 ] )  and  ( [ eq : forcebalance2 ] ) .",
    "if we consider a collision between an isco particle and another free - fall particle around an extremal kerr black hole , an arbitrarily high energy particle collision can also occur in the extremal limit as shown in  @xcite .",
    "we can expect that there is a relation between the approach of the isco to the horizon and the bsw process .    in this paper , to understand the nature of the bsw process deeper , we study high energy particle collision around higher dimensional extremal black holes .",
    "the effective potential for the radial coordinate @xmath5 roughly has the form of @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the mass of the black hole and @xmath8 is the conserved angular momentum for a particle in a @xmath9-dimensional spacetime .",
    "the first term is the gravitational potential and the second term is the potential of centrifugal force . in higher dimensions @xmath10 ,",
    "the power of gravitational force @xmath11 is not greater than that of centrifugal force @xmath12 . in that case , the effective potential does not have a local minimum ; namely , there is no stable circular orbit in contrast with four dimensions .",
    "if the existence of isco is important for the bsw process , we can expect that high energy particle collision can not occur around higher dimensional extremal black holes . on the other hand , recently , it was shown that there are linear instabilities of test fields on the horizon of higher dimensional extremal black holes  @xcite .",
    "if there exists an analogy between instabilities of the test field and the bsw process , we can expect that a high energy particle collision can also occur in higher dimensions .",
    "there is also a discussion for the case of charged particles around an extremal reissner - nordstrm black hole , which can be considered as a similar system for a free - fall test particle around an extremal kerr black hole  @xcite . in this case",
    ", we can understand the critical particle condition for a radially moving charged particle as the force balance between gravitational force and coulomb force . in the case of higher dimensions , we can expect high energy collision between two charged particles can also occur around an extremal charged black hole .",
    "this is because gravitational force and coulomb force have the same power law of radial distance in higher dimensional spacetimes , and the situation is the same as the four - dimensional case .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "since a field with a short wavelength behaves like a test particle , there holds analogies between the phenomena of test particles and fields .",

    "one can expect that the analogy between the bsw process and the test - field instability may hold even if the gravitational backreaction is taken into account .",
    "it is left as a future work to check this analogy because we currently have a quite limited knowledge about the fate of the bsw process in the presence of the gravitational backreaction  @xcite .    while this paper was being prepared for submission , an interesting paper  @xcite by abdujabbarov  _ et al .",

    "we point out , however , that as is noted in  @xcite , @xmath350 and @xmath351 in the case of @xmath348 and @xmath116 do not correspond to a regular horizon but to a naked conical singularity .",

    "<S> we study high energy particle collisions around higher dimensional black holes . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the center of mass energy can be arbitrarily large in the vicinity of the event horizon like the baados , silk and west  ( bsw ) process in four dimensions if the following two conditions are satisfied : ( i ) the horizon is extremal and ( ii ) the parameters of either of the two colliding particles are fine - tuned , which is called a critical particle condition . we also show that a test particle which satisfies the critical particle condition can reach the event horizon from a distant region for a simple case . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the relation between the bsw process and the linear instability of test fields around extremal black holes , the latter of which has been recently found by aretakis  @xcite . </S>"
