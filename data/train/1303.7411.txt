    "few decades ago , artificial atoms emerged timidly in the realm of quantum optics as potential photon sources , eventually alternative to their well established natural counterpart @xcite .",
    "nowadays , due to progress in material fabrication and characterization techniques , they have become not just plausible , but in cases even more suitable for both , basic research and technological applications .",
    "one outstanding example is the initially unambiguous and now impressively diaphanous observation of dressed states in self assembled quantum dots @xcite .",
    "this makes nanostructured qubits ( nq ) most attractive systems for doubly dressing endeavors @xcite .    on the other hand , key properties of optoelectronic systems and devices such as emission [ absorption ] frequencies and intensities ,",
    "are directly determined by the local density of optical states ( ldos ) ; which basically describes how efficient a system is to emit [ absorb ] photons at some particular energy . in those devices ,",
    "the ldos is set by the electronic density of energy states , so that reduction in the dimensionality rises sharpness in the ranges of optically accessible energies .",
    "these changes achieve a limit when all the spacial dimensions are comparable to the wavelength associated to the confined charge carriers ( 0d systems ) , case in which the ldos distribution consists of dirac deltas ( actually narrow lorentzians , as in high quality nqs ) @xcite .    in this work , a size - independent method to control the ldos of a 0d semiconductor emitter is described ; thus providing an indeed realizable scheme to generate photonic subbands of tunable width from fully discretized states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows ; first a general formulation to describe slightly detuned double driven nqs and simulate their resonance fluorescence spectra , is presented .",
    "then , special attention is paid to the monochromatic double dressing case in which photonic subband generation is demonstrated . in the last part",
    "an analytical expression is derived for the relevant case under study , and conclusions are drawn .",
    "the nq is modeled as a semiconductor quantum dot ( qd ) with well defined vacuum and s - type exciton states , separated by energy @xmath0 , under continuous stimulus by two lasers of frequencies @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively [ see figure 1(a ) ] .",
    "the total hamiltonian for the two distinguishable fields interacting with the exciton in the dot , in the jaynes - cummings framework reads    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the rising part of the dot dipole transition operator , @xmath5 is the dot - field coupling , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) are the number of photons and photon annihilation operators for the laser a ( b ) , respectively @xcite .",
    "@xmath10 is an offset than allows the energy reference to be chosen at convenience .",
    "currently , highly confined quantum dots exhibit typical neutral exciton excitation energy at the ev scale @xcite , so that detunings @xmath11 and @xmath12 at the order of terahertz or even far infrared , can be considered much smaller than the resonance frequency @xmath13 .",
    "let us assume @xmath14 and take as basis the triple direct product between the energy eigenstates of the dot and each of the fields , i.e. @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 it can be noted that if the coupling @xmath5 is artificially turned off , for every fixed integer @xmath18 all states with @xmath19 and @xmath20 , alongside of all states with @xmath21 and @xmath22 ; generate a cluster with @xmath23 eigenenergies ranging from @xmath24 ( corresponding to @xmath25 ) to @xmath26 ( corresponding to @xmath27 ) .",
    "now , if the coupling effects are taken into account , the off diagonal non zero terms are    @xmath28    and their corresponding complex conjugates .    for a given @xmath29 , we can rewrite the basis elements in the form @xmath30 , which emphasizes the number of photons in the laser b as compared to the total of photons .",
    "we introduce the label @xmath31 for the elements of the basis in the corresponding cluster ; i.e. @xmath32 .",
    "thus we can notate by @xmath33 the basis of a determined subspace with total number of photons @xmath29 ( see inset in fig .",
    "1 ) . the index @xmath31 is related to the number of photons in the laser b and to the qd state through    @xmath34    once the hamiltonian in eq . ( 1 ) is written in the basis @xmath33 , it can be numerically diagonalized to obtain @xmath23 eigenvalues with their corresponding eigenvectors .",
    "we represent with @xmath35 the orthonormal basis formed by the eigenstates of the coupled system ; that is    @xmath36    the coefficients @xmath37 , are directly obtained from the columns of the unitarian matrix @xmath38 that diagonalizes the hamiltonian , in such a way that @xmath39 ( where @xmath40 is diagonal ) .",
    "they evidently represent the projection of the states of the uncoupled basis on the eigenvectors of the coupled system .",
    "when two lasers with specified powers are applied on the dot , the numbers of photons in lasers a and b interacting with the dot states are set ; let us say @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "this means that the optically accessible states of the coupled system are those in which the specific state @xmath44 , is part of the superposition .",
    "hence , under such conditions the ldos of the coupled system associated to the reference state @xmath45 , is    @xmath46    we are interested in the strong coupling regime , where the rabi splitting as compared to the qd emission linewidth is large enough to allow steady exciton population . in this case the inelastic part of the light - matter scattering is the dominant one @xcite , and the emission intensity in a particular frequency @xmath47 will be proportional to the transition rate of the system releasing a photon of energy @xmath48 . if the transformation @xmath49 is known [ and consequently the ldos @xmath50 , the fluorescence spectrum can be obtained from the fermi golden rule ( fgr ) @xcite .",
    "namely    @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the interaction matrix element in which the lowering operator turns the initial state @xmath53 into the final state @xmath54 , and @xmath55 stands for the availability of the final state in the @xmath56 transition .    in order to include the finite exciton lifetime for simulating realistic spectra , the dirac delta distribution in the fgr can be replaced by a lorentzian distribution @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the @xmath56 transition spectral linewidth ( wigner - weisskopf approximation ) @xcite    for an experimentally set total number of photons  @xmath29 \" , the dominant emitting transitions are those from initial states in the cluster corresponding to the subspace @xmath59 to final states in the cluster corresponding to the subspace @xmath29 .",
    "the relevant matrix element are then those of the form    @xmath60    where the  @xmath61 \" in the coefficients of the final states has been omitted because the elements of the transformation @xmath49 are all real .    considering the action of the operator @xmath62 , the correspondences shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq-3 ] ) , and the orthonormality of the basis @xmath33 ; the required dipole transition matrix elements can be expressed in the compact form    @xmath63",
    "[ fig1 ]    from this point we focus on the resonant monochromatic double dressing case , in which @xmath64 .    given this condition , eq .",
    "( [ eq-1 ] ) for each subspace becomes a tridiagonal matrix with constant diagonal term @xmath65 ( a manifold with degree of degeneracy @xmath23 , if the @xmath5 coupling is turned off ) .",
    "this resembles a closest - neighbor tight - binding hamiltonian with position depending hopping @xcite , whose diagonalization straightaway renders formation of energy bands .",
    "therefore , analogously to the pass from completely discretized atomic states to band structures in crystals ; it is natural to expect a drastic change in the ldos , evolving from fully discretized levels to quasi - continuous photonic subbands .    figure 1(b ) depicts the manifolds formed due to the presence of the two lasers .",
    "the couplings between levels are presented in a analogous way to the hopping terms in a first - neighbor model for one dimensional atomic chains .",
    "diagonalization of this hamiltonian [ see inset in figure 1(b ) ] produces @xmath23 eigenenergies ( @xmath66 ) which are distributed symmetrically around @xmath67 , along the interval @xmath68 .",
    "figure 2(a ) shows a graphical representation of the matrix transformation @xmath49 which diagonalizes the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( 1 ) in the resonant monochromatic double dressing case , while figure 2(b ) presents the ldos as function of the energy and number of photons in the laser b ( for a given @xmath69 ) .",
    "they clearly illustrate how the band structure appears as a direct consequence of the presence of laser b , so that the well defined side peaks ( mollow triplet @xcite ) turn into energy sidebands as the number of photons in that laser increases ( upper and lower subbands , respect to the initially degenerated eigenenergy @xmath70 ) .",
    "[ fig2 ]    in the purely radiative decay limit , for an exciton lifetime @xmath71 , the spectral linewidths are respectively ; @xmath72 for a transition between the upper - upper and lower - lower subbands ( central peak ) , and @xmath73 for a transition between the upper - lower and lower - upper subbands ( side peaks ) @xcite .",
    "for the sake of physical insight and simplicity in calculations , an analytical approximation to obtain the transformation coefficients from well known functions can be pursued .    to do this , for the @xmath29-th manifold we change the basis to symmetric and antisymmetric combinations of the elements of the original one ; i.e. @xmath74 . because the manifold has odd number of states , the last one in the original basis ( @xmath75 ) is intentionally left unpaired for ordering the new basis in reference to it .    in this new basis , the dot - field interaction matrix element @xmath76 , can be further evaluated to obtain    @xmath77    if the new basis is ordered in the form @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , the hamiltonian takes the explicit form    @xmath79    in the above matrix , the effects of the laser a on the qd are contained in the diagonal , where energy splittings of magnitude @xmath80 are observed between the symmetric and antisymmetric combinations @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "taking aside the diagonal part @xmath83 , the diagonalization of the remaining matrix ( @xmath84 ) delivers the energy modifications caused by the laser b on the dressed states of the coupled system qd - laser a. those eigenvalues and eigenvectors define the energy spectrum and ldos of the double driven qd , symmetrically distributed around @xmath85 and @xmath86 ( upper and lower energy subbands ) .    matrix @xmath84 can be seen as composed by four equally sized blocks , plus the row and column corresponding to the state @xmath87 .",
    "the off - diagonal terms in the top - right and bottom - left blocks ( off - diagonal blocks , responsible of the mixing between the diagonal ones ) , increase in absolute value as their position are closer to the matrix center , i.e. @xmath88 .    hence , for the system in the limit @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( in which laser a is much more intense than laser b and then mixing effects between blocks are negligible ) ; the eigenvectors from diagonalization of @xmath84 are a superposition of the new basis according to    @xmath91    where the coefficients @xmath92 are to be associated to a set of orthonormal functions .    since the off - diagonal elements in the top - left [ bottom - right ] block , located exclusively right above and below the matrix diagonal , have the same structure as those of the operator @xmath93 [ @xmath94 written in the eigenbasis of the number of photons operator ( @xmath95 ) @xcite ; in this limit the matrix elements of the transformation that diagonalizes @xmath84 can be obtained in good approximation from the harmonic quantum oscillator eigenfunctions @xmath96 @xcite .",
    "this is    @xmath97    with @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) , a dimensionless continuum parameter which multiplied by @xmath100 becomes the eigenenergy corresponding to the eigenvector @xmath101 .",
    "the functions are explicitly    @xmath102    where @xmath103 is the @xmath104-th order hermite polynomial @xcite .",
    "for the relevant transitions between each of the two subbands in the @xmath59 and @xmath29 manifolds , there are four possibilities : transitions between the upper ( lower ) subbands , alongside with transitions from the upper @xmath59 ( lower @xmath59 ) subband to the lower @xmath29 ( upper @xmath29 ) one .",
    "the dipole transition matrix elements become @xmath105 and @xmath106 , respectively ; where the transition energy has been also shifted to make @xmath107 .    on the other side , the normalized ldos for the reference number of photons @xmath42 as function of the energy of the transition final state ( @xmath108 ) ,",
    "is now given by    @xmath109    figure 3 shows the ldos as function of the emission frequency normalized to the coupling @xmath5 , for different numbers of photons in the laser b. it is worth noting how the ldos has absolute maxima at values close to @xmath110 , respectively @xcite . for frequencies more separated from the reference ( @xmath111 ) , it decays rapidly to zero ; setting an approximate width for the subbands of two - times the rabi splitting associated to the laser b.    under these considerations , the fgr yields for the emission spectrum    @xmath112   \\hspace*{1ex } \\rho_{m}(e_f ) \\hspace*{1ex } l(\\hbar\\omega + e_f - e_i,\\gamma_{i , f } ) \\hspace*{1ex } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    which after insertion of eq .",

    "( [ app-1 ] ) and the analytical approximation of eq .",
    "( [ app-2 ] ) . in the upper frame , for a @xmath117 close to the value of the coupling constant @xmath5 ( i.e. the exciton lifetime is large enough respect to the rabi oscillation periods defined by the laser intensities )",
    "; it is clearly appreciated how the mollow side peaks of the single excitation laser case evolve into sidebands , reflecting the energy band formation under the double dot - field coupling .",
    "markedly the subband width increases with the number of photons in the laser b.    in other words , due to the second driving field , well defined peaks spread into optically active regions ; then exhibiting similarities with ldos proper of higher dimensionality systems @xcite .",
    "when @xmath117 is substantially larger than @xmath5 , the effects of the second laser become less noticeable and useful .",
    "this because in the time dominion , the short exciton lifetime inhibits coherent rabi oscillations making almost irrelevant the presence of laser b. this sensitivity of the system to the ratio between @xmath5 and @xmath117 provides a way to estimate the order of magnitude of the dot - field coupling .",
    "figures 4(a ) and 4(b ) , evidence that the analytical approximation behind eq .",
    "( [ app-2 ] ) , as long as the value of @xmath118 is not close to one , works ostensibly well even for a moderate number of photons .",
    "the main discrepancy is found around the subband edges , where the exact calculation predicts slight asymmetry due to the finite nature of the gilbert subspaces .",
