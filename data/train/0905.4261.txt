    "over the past decade there have been numerous experimental and theoretical studies in atomic , molecular and optical physics  @xcite and in quantum information science  @xcite focusing on the interaction of gas - phase neutral atoms with static or electromagnetic fields projected by planar micro- or nanofabricated structures .",
    "the tight dimensional control that can be achieved via modern lithographic techniques generally enables new regimes of performance and scalability in integrated atomic devices , which hopefully can be used to further the success of recent technology breakthroughs such as chip - scale atomic clocks  @xcite and magnetometers  @xcite .    in many such scenarios  in particular those exploiting strong coupling of trapped atoms with optical fields confined in photonic waveguides or resonators  robust and accurate localization of atoms near solid surfaces emerges as a critical requirement .",
    "indeed , the prospect of tight control over atomic ensembles alone has driven much of the development of integrated atomic platforms .",
    "often atomic localization is achieved by `` scaling down '' trapping techniques first developed in free - space , as in the manipulation of neutral atoms by magnetic field gradients created by current - carrying microwires  @xcite or by optical dipole forces induced by the evanescent tails of confined laser fields  @xcite .",
    "robust and conceptually simple , these techniques typically improve in strength and efficiency as the atoms are brought closer to the defining structure(s ) .",
    "however , bulk surface effects become dominant at short distances . for small values of the atom - surface separation @xmath2 ,",
    "energy potentials for optical dipole traps and magnetostatic microwire traps are roughly proportional to @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , whereas van der waals potentials have a much stronger variation @xmath5 .",
    "hence many integrated atomic systems are expected to exist in an awkward regime where atoms are kept close to trap - defining structures to achieve tight potentials , but not so close that van der waals effects become problematic . in the context of cavity quantum electrodynamics ( cavity qed ) with monolithic dielectric resonators",
    "this can be a particularly significant compromise , as it generally precludes realization of the strongest possible atom - photon coupling parameters , which would require stable placement of atoms nearly in contact with the resonator surface .",
    "for this reason and others  @xcite , van der waals interactions can thus become a limiting factor in the achievable performance of a wide range of integrated atomic devices , and we are motivated to investigate new approaches to atom manipulation that can compete with the strong onset of common @xmath6 surface effects .",
    "it may be anticipated that such approaches will rely on the physics particular to atoms in the near field of bulk structures , rather than the reapplication of techniques developed _ in vacuo_.    a reasonable first step in this direction could be to explore the design of trapping schemes that attempt to exploit serendipitous aspects of the atom - surface interaction .",
    "for example , the demonstration of a _ positive _ van der waals energy shift of a particular excited state of cs over an oriented sapphire crystal that is orders of magnitude larger than typical , attractive van der waals potentials  @xcite suggests a possible means of surface - specific manipulation of atoms . if the van der waals , repulsive character of an excited atomic state may be accessed appropriately in the near - field of a surface , it would provide a valuable tool for the efficient localization of atoms very close to structures of interest .",
    "the anomalous van der waals perturbation demonstrated in @xcite arises from the off - resonant coupling of an atomic transition to a surface polariton resonance in the sapphire crystal , suggesting that analogous and potentially improved phenomena could be accessed in alternative systems chosen or even created using modern methods and insights from materials science and nanofabrication .    in this article",
    "we describe and analyze ( through numerical simulations ) a scheme for using off - resonant coupling of gas - phase atoms to surface polariton resonances in a surface near field to produced van der waals-_enhanced _ optical potentials . in section [ interactions ]",
    "we summarize previous work that connects atom - surface van der waals effects to a perturbative interaction with surface field modes .",
    "then in section [ mirrors ] we describe a general approach to harnessing these effects with laser fields to produce surface enhanced optical potentials .",
    "section [ example ] illustrates this approach with simulations of specific systems based on @xmath0k and a planar indium tin oxide ( ito ) surface . and in concluding , we mention some possible paths toward engineering general , useful van der waals interactions .",
    "qed interactions between atoms and/or bulk materials have been analyzed in many contexts over almost 80 years ( e.g. @xcite ) , but this section will largely summarize relevant results in work by wylie and sipe @xcite ( whose perspective we adopt throughout the article ) as they naturally highlight the importance of surface excitations in producing anomalous van der waals effects .",
    "an atom near a macroscopic structure experiences effects often dominated by the perturbing interaction of the atomic dipole and radiation field @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the atomic dipole operator and @xmath9 is the transverse displacement field operator at the atom s position .",
    "thus , just as atomic level shifts and the spontaneous decay of excited states arise from interactions with radiation modes in a vacuum , van der waals effects are produced by similar physical processes , with contributions from a near field , planar surface .",
    "for example , in a purely semi - classical description , an excited atomic dipole near an interface will have a reaction to the reflected portion of its own induced radiation field .",
    "as the amplitude of the reflected field at the atom s position increases , so do these reactive , surface - induced effects .    without having to specify any geometry or optical properties of the system yet",
    ", the energy shift of atomic level @xmath10 may be approximated by second order perturbation theory @xmath11 where @xmath12 indicates the principal part , the summation is over field states @xmath13 and @xmath14 and atomic states @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the energy eigenvalue for un - perturbed field or atomic state @xmath17 , @xmath18 denotes an assumed thermal distribution of the field , and the summation over vector components @xmath19 and @xmath20 is implied . also , the transition rate from atomic state @xmath10 to @xmath15 is given by fermi s golden rule @xmath21 we introduce the correlation functions @xmath22\\rangle\\theta(t)\\nonumber\\\\ \\tilde{\\alpha}_{\\alpha\\beta}^a(t ) & = & i\\hbar^{-1}\\langle a|[\\mu_\\alpha(t),\\mu_\\beta(0)]|a\\rangle\\theta(t),\\label{correlation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are interaction picture operators with respect to @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the heaviside step function , and also specify their fourier transforms : @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "describe the linear response of operator expectation @xmath29 , given a perturbation proportional to @xmath30 . and ,",
    "from linear response theory , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the generalized susceptibilities for the field and the atom .",
    "in particular , @xmath27 may be identified with the expected displacement field induced by an oscillating _ classical _ dipole , and @xmath28 the polarizability of the @xmath31 atomic state by the field .",
    "the fluctuation - disspation theorem , a zero temperature approximation ( appropriate for optical frequencies at room temperature ) , and the analytic properties of the susceptibilities allow eqs . and to be written @xmath32 where @xmath33 .",
    "one of the advantages of this approach is that the contribution to @xmath27 from an interface may be simply added that of free space by the superposition principle , and therefore the surface effects can be considered separately from the ( formally divergent ) free space effects . from here on , we make this separation and only consider the effects from field modes emanating from the surface . the first term on the rhs of eq . , @xmath34 ,",
    "may be associated with the polarization energy of the atom due to quantum fluctuations in these surface modes , in analogy to the lamb shift in free space .",
    "as the term integrates the susceptibilities over imaginary frequencies , this shift is always real , usually negative  -level s contribution to @xmath34 carries the sign of @xmath35 , as is suggested from eq . .",
    "thus for downward transitions , @xmath34 will be positive , but the net shift will often be negative because @xmath36 for any interface that is moderately reflective at @xmath37 ( see eq . [ de_nf ] ) . ] , and generally insensitive to resonances in the environment , giving rise to the familiar , attractive van der waals potential for ground state atoms .",
    "this is in contrast to the last term in eq . , @xmath38 , which arises from the residue of the principal part integration in eq .",
    "this term has none of the analytic constraints of the first term : it may be either positive or negative , and is highly sensitive to environmental resonances near @xmath39 . due to the zero temperature field assumption",
    ", this residue exists only for _ excited _ atomic states , which may be degenerate with other states of the atom plus field .",
    "as it originates from global energy degeneracies , this term admits a semi - classical physical interpretation of the energy associated with an atomic dipole interacting with the _ in phase _ portion of its own , expected reflected field .",
    "similarly , eq .   may be viewed in analogy to the dephasing rate of an excited dipole from the interaction with the _ out of phase _ portion of the expected reflected field .",
    "the atomic polarizability can be shown to be @xmath40 while the field susceptibility may be constructed from a plane wave decomposition of the reflected electromagnetic field produced by an oscillating dipole above a particular surface .",
    "to specify now some general aspects of the system , the interface is assumed to be translationally invariant in the @xmath41 plane ( see figure [ fig : dipole_interface ] ) which gives @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the components of the vacuum wave vector at the transfer region - vacuum interface perpendicular and parallel to @xmath46 , respectively , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the s- and p - polarized electric field vectors in the vacuum for upward @xmath49 and downward @xmath50 propagating fields , @xmath51 are the fresnel coefficients of the transfer region for the respective polarizations , and @xmath52 is the height of the atom above the surface of the transfer region .     the assumed geometry of an oriented atomic dipole in vacuum at height @xmath52 above a planar , transfer region interface that separates an underlying bulk substrate with dielectric constant @xmath53 from the vacuum . adapted from @xcite.,width=240 ]    although surface interactions are typically considered in the near field limit , which leads to a dramatic simplification of @xmath27 , eq . is especially useful for engineering considerations , as it directly connects the effects on the atom by the surface with an intuitive picture of the dipole interacting with all possible , reflected surface modes at frequency @xmath54 . in particular , if the fresnel coefficients are large over a large range of @xmath44 at an atomic transition frequency @xmath39 , the corresponding effects described by eq . and the last term of eq . will be likewise large and carry the sign of the integrated fresnel coefficients .",
    "the common case of an atom above a bulk substrate ( no transfer region ) with separations @xmath55 may be considered by taking the near - field limit ( @xmath56 ) in eq . .",
    "in this limit , the fresnel coefficients become @xmath57-independent , and the integral may be simply evaluated : @xmath58 where the final `` image factor '' is the familiar , `` quasi - static , '' p - polarized fresnel coefficient of the interface ( and all other @xmath27 components are @xmath59 ) . in this limit ,",
    "all surface modes coupling to the atom are evanescent ( re@xmath60 ) , and therefore bound to the surface .",
    "resonant surface excitations in _ all _ @xmath44 modes are excited by the atom as @xmath61 , leading to a divergent response in @xmath38 and @xmath62 .",
    "significantly , an anomalously large , _ positive _ , van der waals - like energy shift of excited atomic states may be realized by off - resonant coupling to these surface excitations in the near field as @xmath63 .",
    "an intuitive explanation for this effect is that the atomic dipole may interact with a near field image dipole ( without retardation ) that because of material resonances is both larger than and @xmath64-shifted from the image dipole in an ordinary reflector .",
    "for example , consider a drude metal with the dielectric function @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the metal s plasma frequency and @xmath67 the electron collision rate .",
    "using @xmath68 , the real part of the image factor in eq .",
    "reaches a minimum of @xmath69 when @xmath70 .",
    "compared to @xmath71 , image factor for a perfect conductor , this minimum coefficient has the opposite sign and is far larger in magnitude when @xmath72 . the corresponding imaginary part of the minimum image factor is @xmath73 , which notably also diverges for a `` dissipation free '' metal , @xmath74 .",
    "an excited atom with a _ downward _ transition frequency near @xmath75 in the near field of this drude metal will experience a positive energy shift proportional to @xmath76 that will dominate @xmath34 when @xmath72 .",
    "also , the spontaneous emission rate of that particular transition will likewise be enhanced by a factor of order @xmath77 , proportional to @xmath76 .",
    "the flexibility of @xmath38 suggests that a resonant material interface may be used to engineer the energy potential of an atom in its near field . however , to do so we are required to find a suitable means of accessing these _ excited _ state effects , while keeping the atomic heating from spontaneous emission manageable .",
    "previously used to measure the attractive van der waals potential for alkali atoms near transparent dielectrics @xcite , optical atom mirrors could provide a simple platform to study and begin to exploit anomalous interactions of atoms and surface polaritons . in a traditional optical atom mirror , an evanescent , coherent field",
    "is produced by total internal reflection of a laser beam from a planar , vacuum - dielectric interface ( see figure [ fig : atom_mirror ] ) .",
    "if the frequency of the laser is far blue - detuned from a ground state transition , an atom approaching the evanescent field experiences a repulsive optical dipole force proportional to the intensity of the field : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the rabi oscillation frequency the atom would undergo at the dielectric surface if the laser was on resonance , @xmath80 is the detuning of the field from the transition frequency , and @xmath81 is the field amplitude decay rate ( typically of order the angular wave number of the laser ) . for sufficiently large @xmath82 , this optical potential may repel incident , cold thermal atoms ( e.g. falling in vacuum under the influence of gravity ) with minimal heating from spontaneous emission .",
    "the inclusion of van der waals effects adds an attractive , @xmath83 , potential associated with the red - shifting of the atomic ground state ( as measured in @xcite ) , but also modifies the laser detuning as both ground and excited states are perturbed .",
    "these surface - induced modifications to the optical potential may be used to produce van der waals-_enhanced _ optical potentials , where the repulsive energy is derived from the laser fields , but the spatial variation of the potential carries the sharp character of the surface interactions : as the van der waals , @xmath83 , modifications occur predominantly in the near field where the un - perturbed @xmath82 is roughly linear , the enhancement will be sharply peaked . as a simple example ,",
    "if the excited state experiences a very large , positive van der waals shift from coupling to resonant surface excitations , the field detuning will decrease faster than the red - shifting of the ground state . in the perturbative regime ,",
    "@xmath84 , the van der waals contributions to the potential are @xmath85 and so an appropriately large and positive @xmath86 will provide a steep ( @xmath83 ) and repulsive @xmath87 . also note that the probe need not be evanescent in this case to achieve near field repulsion .",
    "however , it is important to recognize that this system will also experience an enhanced rate of spontaneous emission in the near field @xmath88 , which will be comparable to the optical potential enhancement if @xmath89 , as suggested in the end of section [ interactions ] .",
    "although this necessarily increases the heating rate , surface - induced spontaneous emission enhancement can sharply redistribute atomic populations in the near field @xcite to advantageous effect .",
    "for example , enhanced emission may `` turn off '' target optical dipole transitions and thus quench dipole forces .",
    "if a ground state atom experiences balanced attractive and repulsive optical dipole forces at moderate atom - surface separations @xcite , greatly enhanced spontaneous emission on the `` attractive '' dipole transition can produce a net repulsive force in the surface near field , producing a sharp barrier and preventing collisions with the surface .",
    "as this general approach is particularly valid when spontaneous emission enhancement dominants any energy level shifts , its application may be particularly useful when the stability of atomic transitions is required .",
    "moreover , in comparison , to other `` repulsive '' van der waals interactions that rely on the reflection of atomic wavepackacts from steeply attractive van der waals potentials @xcite , both approaches outlined above are designed to manipulate the classical center of mass , and thus may be performed with atoms with relatively small de broglie wavelengths .    more accurate and general optical forces for thermal atoms",

    "typically , the internal state of the atom relaxes much faster than the external parameters change ( i.e. the velocity of the atom times the spatial derivative of the coefficients in eq .",
    "is much less than @xmath62 ) . in such regimes ,",
    "use of @xmath101 to estimate the force on the atom as a function position may be justified .",
    "to associate an internal atomic state to a force on the center of mass ( cm ) motion of the atom , we adopt a semi - classical approximation that assumes quantized internal dynamics ( eq . ) , but classical cm dynamics .",

    "similarly , it is straightforward to show that the steady state heating rate of the atom due to isotropic spontaneous emission is @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the mass of the atom .",

    "thus , strong resonant interactions with common bulk materials are likely to occur in multiply - excited states of alkali atoms , which have strong , @xmath114 m wavelength transitions @xcite . however , working with these highly excited atomic states is often very difficult .",
    "for example , although the resonant van der waals interaction of the cs @xmath115 ( 12-@xmath116 m ) transition and oriented crystal sapphire is very large @xcite , an even partially excited @xmath117 state will populate so many lower - lying levels through spontaneous emission @xcite that construction of an enhanced optical potential is difficult both to model and achieve .    however , there are combinations of common materials and convenient alkali states that admit a significant interaction without large complications from the multi - level atomic structure .",

    "as a function of time , the ( instantaneous position - dependent ) force eigenstate populations @xmath134 are presented in the left figure .",
    "purple ( cyan ) lines represent 1.178@xmath116 m ( 767 nm ) spontaneous emission events , which instantly project the @xmath0k atom into the @xmath120 ( @xmath121 ) state .",
    "the right figure depicts the force expectations @xmath162 over the same time interval . because our particular choice of measurement projects the system into an atomic eigenstate , rather than an energy eigenstate , the internal states @xmath134 undergo rapid and ( roughly ) coherent evolution between spontaneous emission events , giving rise to oscillations in the expected force on the atoms .",
    "although the exact evolution is specific to the system , separation , and choice of measurements in the simulation , it is important to note how each photon count abruptly ends the previous form of schrdinger - like evolution and initiates a new form , characteristic of the type of count that occurred .",
    "thus we see that in addition to the random momentum kick from photon scattering , spontaneous emission also gives rise to fluctuations in the dipole force that , although averaged over in the steady state potential eq .",
    ", should be considered another source of heating . however",
    ", this insight also provides a clear picture of how spontaneous emission rates can effect the _ time - averaged forces _ on the atom : the total , time - averaged force may be estimated from the relative frequency of the spontaneous emission events and the time - averaged force of the schrdinger - like evolution they initiate ( over a characteristic time interval ) .",

    "while figure [ fig : drop ] suggested the validity of @xmath164 at a single position ( the classical turning point ) over many trajectories , figure [ fig : ss_vs_traj ] suggests the steady state potential for a single trajectory over a wide range of separations .     left : effective , steady state optical potentials with @xmath165 that exhibit a near field potential minimum .",

    "as depicted in figure [ fig : trap ] .",
    "quantum trajectory simulations of atoms initially at rest at the potential minimum suggest a mean trapping time of 20@xmath116s before heating effects eject the atom ( figure ) , whereas ito * potentials produce no such trapping and lose atoms within @xmath116s. although these trapping times are modest in this ( non - optimized ) potential , they are long compared to many fast atomic processes that characterize near - field atomic systems ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "traps and barriers with significantly lower heating rates would be possible for systems with anomalous van der waals interactions that are an order of magnitude or more larger than the ground state perturbations ( e.g. effects on the order of demonstrated in cs and sapphire interactions @xcite ) .",
    "although encouraging that significant surface - repulsion enhancement appears experimentally plausible with anomalous van der waals effects of only moderate strength ( predicted using published atomic and material data ) , many of the specific results of the previous section are of course limited to the case of @xmath0k and carefully prepared ito surfaces  @xcite ( although , in addition to the surface resonance emphasized here , the unique optical and electrical properties of ito suggest a potential utility in integrated atomic systems in general ) . although attractive pairings of alkali atoms and common materials are limited by an apparent dearth of high quality surface polariton resonances in the near infrared  @xcite ,",
    "engineering useful resonances with even simple surface patterning is a distinct possibility .",
    "guided in particular by eq .",
    ", it is straightforward to recognize and analyze how construction of a transfer region ( figure  [ fig : dipole_interface ] ) with planar thin films  @xcite , gratings @xcite , or even material dopants @xcite could be used to perturb the dispersion of surface excitations , tuning them to useful atomic transitions .",
    "this line of research would naturally compliment current investigations that leverage similar effects using plasmonics to enhance and collect the spontaneous emission from embedded dipoles  @xcite .",
    "harnessing surface effects for strong , near field manipulation of gas - phase atoms would enable integrated atomic systems and ( at least in this implementation ) employ an interesting intersection of fundamental qed , atomic physics , material science and surface polaritonics .",
    "although exceptional , anomalous van der waals effects admit an intuitive physical picture ( section  [ interactions ] ) that should facilitate their generalization . and as suggested by section  [ example ] , the effects need not be large for significant enhancement of near field potentials , and efficient steady state analysis may be reasonably accurate",
    ". however , we emphasize again that the identification of a broad class of surfaces with resonant excitations tunable to atomic transitions would open the door to general application of van der waals - enhanced optical dipole potentials for atoms .",
    "estimating the influence of a surface on atomic states is complicated , even in the near field where the field susceptibilities may be approximated by eq . .",
    "in this limit , with a simple planar interface , the energy shifts and spontaneous emission enhancement are @xmath166 we can therefore break up our calculation into separate parts : the dipole transition strengths , @xmath167 , and the image factors , @xmath168 and @xmath169",
    ".    we will neglect any atomic hyperfine structure and assume an isotropically prepared atomic dipole for calculation and conceptual clarity .",
    "the widths of @xmath170 features will be on the order of .1ev , while typical alkali hyperfine splittings are only of order 10ghz or less @xcite .",
    "thus image factors should not vary significantly between hyperfine states .",
    "however , these splittings are of order the energy scales of typical laser rabi frequencies and detunings .",
    "moreover , atomic dipole moments vary greatly between different hyperfine spin projections .",
    "a more thorough analysis of @xmath167 should be considered in any experimental implementation .    under these approximations",
