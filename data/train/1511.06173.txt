    "<S> .    nevertheless , analytical results on cover times are scarce . </S>",

    "<S> this constitutes the central result of this paper . </S>",
    "<S> its derivation relies on the fact that the distribution of the global first - passage time @xmath17 to a given target site is asymptotically an exponential of mean @xmath16 for non compact random walks @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> several comments are in order . </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) the result of equation ( [ dist ] ) unveils the universal dependence of the distribution of the partial cover time on both the random walk process  through only the global mean first - passage time to a single target  , and the geometry of the domain  through only its volume @xmath0 ( using that @xmath16 asymptotically depends on the geometry only through @xmath0 @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) the result of equation ( [ dist ] ) reveals a deep connexion with order statistics , already pointed out in the mathematical literature for regular random walks @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , equation ( [ dist ] ) is the limit distribution of the @xmath18 largest among @xmath0 independent identically distributed random variables in the large @xmath0 regime ( gumbel universality class ) . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , in the case @xmath3 , the full cover time can easily be seen as the largest among the first - passage times @xmath19 of the searcher to site @xmath20 , where @xmath21 covers all sites of the domain . </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ dist ] ) indeed yields in this case ( @xmath22 ) the classical gumbel law . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , the partial cover time @xmath23 can be seen as the @xmath18 largest among the @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> what we find here is that in the case of non compact exploration , the @xmath24 are asymptotically independent in the large @xmath0 regime . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) the result of equation ( [ dist ] ) provides in particular an explicit determination of the mean partial cover time @xmath25 in the large @xmath0 regime , where @xmath26 denotes the polygamma function of order @xmath27 , and which is in agreement with exact results obtained for the full cover time in the particular case of brownian walks on periodic lattices @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( iv ) beyond the mean , the variance of the partial cover time can be determined and is given asymptotically by @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to a reduced variance @xmath29 , which shows that the amplitude of the relative fluctuations slowly decays with the domain size . </S>",
    "<S> ( v ) the distribution of related observables can be readily deduced from this approach , and depends on the search process only through the global mean first - passage time @xmath16 to a given target in the domain for a single searcher . </S>",
    "<S> for example the distribution of the random cover time , defined above as the time needed to visit @xmath2 _ given _ sites of a domain of @xmath0 sites @xcite , is obtained in the limit @xmath30 by taking @xmath22 in equation ( [ dist ] ) ( gumbel law ) , with the new rescaled variable @xmath31 ( see si ) . in turn , in the important case where @xmath27 searchers explore the domain simultaneously , the distribution of the partial cover time is also given by equation ( [ dist ] ) , with the new rescaled variable @xmath32 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now confirm these analytical results by monte carlo simulations of most of the models of random search strategies invoked in the literature : brownian random walks , persistent random walks , lvy flights and lvy walks , intermittent random walks , and random walks on complex networks . </S>",
    "<S> figures ( [ fig1 ] ) and ( [ fig2 ] ) reveal excellent quantitative agreement between the analytical predictions and the numerical simulations . the prediction of equation ( [ dist ] ) unambiguously captures the mean , variance , and entire distribution of partial and full cover times ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig1 ] ) and ( [ fig2 ] ) ) , as well as random cover times and cover times for @xmath27 searchers ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig2 ] ) ) , as shown by the data collapse of the numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that the very different nature of these examples demonstrates that the range of applicability of our approach , which mainly relies on the non compact property of the random trajectory of the searcher , is wide . </S>",
    "<S> note that even for @xmath33 persistent random walks , which are in fact marginally compact , both the mean and variance of cover times are quantitatively predicted by our approach in the large domain size limit , provided that the persistence length minimizes the global mean first - passage time for a target @xmath16 , as analyzed in @xcite .    in practice </S>",
    "<S> , the question of minimizing the cover time in order to optimize the efficiency of the search process is crucial . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis reveals that the mean cover time ( either random or partial ) is minimized exactly when the global mean first - passage time @xmath16 for a _ single target _ is minimized ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig3 ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , in the case of persistent random walks and intermittent random walks , which have been shown to minimize @xmath16 ( either by tuning the persistence length of the persistent random walk or the duration of the scanning phase of the intermittent random walk ) , we find that mean cover times can also be minimized . for lvy walks , </S>",
    "<S> the celebrated optimization of the target encounter rate for a lvy index @xmath34 ( defined through the jump length distribution @xmath35 for @xmath36 large ) has been obtained and discussed only for a distribution of infinitely many so - called revisitable targets ( which reappear at the same position after being found ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the global mean first - passage time to a single target in confinement , which by definition involves a non revisitable target , has been left aside . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , we find that @xmath16 ( see also @xcite ) , and therefore the mean cover time , can be minimized by adjusting the persistence length for all @xmath37 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig3 ] ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> this optimal strategy , which does not require revisitable targets , is therefore very different from the above mentioned optimal strategy obtained for infinitely many revisitable targets . </S>",
    "<S> all together , these results shed new light on the role of persistent , intermittent and lvy strategies in the optimization of search processes , and clearly points towards their robustness . </S>"
