    "general elements of @xmath15 are non - singular , but @xmath15 contains a 1-dimensional sub - family of rational curves with nodes or cusps .    for any @xmath16 ,",
    "the linear system @xmath17 is a pencil consisting of del pezzo surfaces of degree 1 .",
    "since @xmath9 is the complete intersection of any 2 elements of @xmath17 , the blow - up @xmath18 has a natural projection @xmath19 , which is a mori fibration in del pezzo surfaces of degree 1 .",
    "let us note that if @xmath9 has a node , the corresponding @xmath20 has the simplest double point ( given by the equation @xmath21 in some local coordinates ) , and if @xmath9 has a cusp , @xmath20 has a unique singular point of type @xmath22 .",
    "we recall that , by definition , a birational map @xmath23 between two mori fibrations @xmath24 and @xmath25 defines the same mori structure ( or that @xmath26 and @xmath27 are birational over base ) , if    * in case @xmath28 , there exists a birational map @xmath29 such that @xmath30 , * in case @xmath31 ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 are @xmath34-fano varieties ) , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are isomorphic to each other ( whence @xmath35 ) .",

    "the previous results were re - proved in a more regular way , and finally the following assertion was achieved : if a linear system @xmath41 without fixed components has a maximal singularity at @xmath42 , then either @xmath42 is a curve from @xmath15 , or @xmath42 is the singular point of some @xmath16 for the corresponding maximal valuation on @xmath0 given by a weighted blow - up of type @xmath43 , @xmath44 , in nodal case and @xmath45 in cuspidal case ( theorem 3.1 in @xcite ) .    in order to complete proving theorem [ main_th ] , we have to exclude maximal singularities over points of @xmath0 and , if @xmath41 has a maximal singularity along @xmath16 , jump onto @xmath46 . on @xmath20 ,",
    "one needs to show that the strict transform of @xmath41 must not have super - maximal singularities , and then we are done .",

    "we see that @xmath655 , the strict transform of @xmath566 cuts out the minimal section @xmath634 on @xmath51 .",
    "the strict transforms of the curves @xmath565 and @xmath341 intersect @xmath51 at two points that lie outside of the minimal section and does not lie in the same fiber .",
