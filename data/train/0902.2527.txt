    "<S> the studies on the vortex solutions of the fluid systems are useful not only in fluid ( including atmospheric and oceanic ) dynamics but also in many other physical fields including the condense matter , plasma physics , nuclear physics , astrophysics and cosmology @xcite .    in this paper , rich types of steady modes for rotating stratified flows </S>",
    "<S> have been obtained because of the entrance of some arbitrary functions . </S>",
    "<S> though there are also abundant circulations in the nature such as the hurricanes , tornados , ocean circulations etc . , we hope that experimental scientists will find some of exact modes mentioned in this letter . </S>"
