    "however , there appears to be no comprehensive raw data treatment for transmission experiments , especially in the ucn range , so far described , and no theoretical model yet to explain the scattering cross section behavior .",
    "the research presented here proposes both a raw data treatment and a theoretical explanation of the scattering cross sections @xcite .",
    "ucns are neutrons slow enough to be reflected from suitable materials under any angle of incidence .",
    "this allows for their confinement in material bottles , which significantly increases interaction and observation times .",
    "typically , ucns are defined to have a kinetic energy of @xmath2350nev or less . in our research ,",
    "neutrons with an energy lower than 1000nev are regarded as ultracold , for this is the maximum energy of the neutron spectrum supplied by the ucn source (  turbine \" ) at ill @xcite .",
    "ucns are used predominantly in the study of fundamental physics principles , such as the free - neutron lifetime @xcite , the search for a possible nonzero neutron electric dipole moment ( nedm ) @xcite , and the validity of newton s law of gravity on the micrometer scale .",
    "the former two experiments are valuable tools to test the standard model of particle physics and its extensions or even to discover physics beyond the standard model .",
    "another research project benefiting from the use of ucns is the measurement of the neutron @xmath3-decay asymmetry @xcite , which helps us to understand the spin and flavor structure of the nucleon . at present , statistics are the main limiting factor of these experiments . significantly higher ucn fluxes will allow a considerable increase of these experiments accuracy . to date , ill s turbine is the most intense ucn source , while solid deuterium converters are promising to increase the maximum possible flux in the near future @xcite . for further references and the history of ucn science ,",
    "see the books of ignatovich @xcite and golub @xcite .",
    "due to the nuclear spin of the deuteron ( @xmath4=1 ) the homonuclear diatomic deuterium molecule exists in two symmetry configurations ( also called _ species _ )  _ ortho _ ( with an even rotational quantum number @xmath5 ) and _ para _ ( odd @xmath5 ) @xcite .",
    "in order to suppress neutron up - scattering from the rotational relaxation @xmath5=1@xmath60 , the _ ortho_-deuterium concentration was maximized ( i.e. , to @xmath7 ) in previous experiments examining the viability of deuterium and deuterated substances as ucn converters @xcite . in our experiment",

    "the sample cell consisted of an aluminum alloy ( almg3 ) torus closed by two windows machined from aluminum ( almg3 , 0.3 mm thick ) .",

    "this resulted in a disk - shaped liquid deuterium sample of 40 mm diameter and 3 mm thickness .",
    "indium wire was used as a cryogenic sealant .",
    "placed inside a vacuum cylinder , the sample cell was cooled by a sumitomo closed - cycle liquid - helium cryostat ( 1.5w at 4k ) from below and the deuterium was inserted through a feed line on its top .",
    "a resistive heater in the base of the sample cell was used for sample temperature control .",
    "the two thin - film resistance temperature sensors were located inside the torus immediately above and below the sample volume , respectively .",

    "the latter was custom designed and consisted of two movable polyethylene grids with a trapezoidal opening function of 7ms fwhm and was operated in vacuum at 8hz ( about 1/16 duty cycle ) .",
    "a trigger actuated the chopper and synchronized it with the detector .",
    "the total flight path inside a tube coated with polyethylene on the inside was 263 mm long .",
    "a cascade detector @xcite ( based on @xmath18b ) with around 90% detection efficiency for ucns was mounted at the end of the experimental setup .",
    "the detector was continuously flushed with an ar - co@xmath19 ( 90:10 ) gas mixture under ambient pressure and an acceleration voltage of 1200v was applied .",
    "up until now , theoretical models of coherent and incoherent scattering of slow neutrons in deuterium have been based on semi - empirical models of the scattering law @xmath20 ; for an example see bernnat _",

    "the thermal de broglie wavelength is small compared to the geometrical diameter of the particle  @xcite . for deuterium @xmath33 .",

    "the two scattering laws need to be convolved in order to yield the correct scattering law @xmath45 in the liquid state .",
    "we approximate the gaussian as a delta function , because it has a significantly smaller hwhm than the quasi - elastic diffusion peak .",
