    "when the bose  einstein condensate ( bec ) of alkali metal atoms was discovered in 1995  @xcite , some of the immediate issues to be clarified were whether this system exhibits quantum coherence and whether it shows superfluidity , similar to that of superfluid @xmath0he .",
    "quantized vortices are manifestations of these properties and their realization has been one of the main research topics of experimental bec physics since its discovery  @xcite . in general , the existence of stable vortices and other topological objects is attributed to an order parameter manifold with nontrivial homotopy groups supporting these objects  @xcite .",
    "methods to create vortices in becs by so - called topological phase imprinting have been proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite and these proposals were later experimentally realized by several groups  @xcite .",
    "in addition to vortex creation , an extension of this method into a non - trivially three - dimensional scenario  @xcite has been used in the experimental creation of a dirac monopole in the synthetic magnetic field of a spinor bec  @xcite .",
    "other methods to create vortices include the utilization of moving laser beams  @xcite , rotating trap potentials  @xcite , laguerre  gauss beams  @xcite , and merging multiple condensates  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the topological phase imprinting method is that it creates vortices deterministically at a desired location and almost all atoms in the condensate acquire the desired angular momentum .",
    "the operating principle of a vortex pump  @xcite is based on sequential application of the topological phase imprinting protocol , thus increasing the winding number by @xmath1 for each vortex pumping cycle , where @xmath2 is the quantum number of the hyperfine spin .",
    "conventionally , various vortex pumping methods resorts to adiabatic control of the system to imprint local berry phase  @xcite . hence , rapid pumping gives rise to errors owing to unwanted nonadiabatic transitions , eventually leading to the degradation of the pump . on the other hand ,",
    "a vortex with a large winding number is dynamically unstable into splitting into multiple single - quantum vortices  @xcite , motivating faster vortex pumping .",
    "the stability of the large - winding - number states has been studied  @xcite , as well as their splitting dynamics  @xcite .",
    "importantly , the counter - diabatic ( cd ) protocol  @xcite , which is sometimes referred to as assisted adiabatic population transfer or shortcut to adiabaticity  @xcite , can generate the same state as the corresponding adiabatic dynamics in shorter time .",
    "therefore , it can be utilized to overcome several problems in adiabatic quantum control , for example , in cases in which the population transfer efficiency is limited by decoherence , three - body losses , and external noise in the control parameters of , e.g. , isolated atoms and molecules  @xcite , spin chain systems @xcite , bose  einstein condensates  @xcite , and electron spin of a single nitrogen - vacancy center in a diamond  @xcite .",
    "very recently , the cd protocol was also found to speed up the topological phase imprinting method  @xcite .",
    "however , vortex pumping using the cd protocol has not been reported to date .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that the cd quantum control , assisted by an optical plug , can accelerate the vortex pump , and hence create a large - winding - number state in a short time .",
    "this also serves to reduce the atom loss from the trap .",
    "we consider a spin-1 bec consisting of @xmath3rb atoms in an optical trap with a three - dimensional quadrupole field present .",
    "the parameters in the simulations are set to experimentally feasible values according to refs .",
    "in addition , we introduce an optical plug along the symmetry axis of the condensate to prevent transitions between the hyperfine spin states during the fast magnetic field ramp .",
    "we study the fidelity of the vortex creation and the state of the condensate for up to 20 vortex pumping cycles by numerically integrating the three - dimensional multi - component gross  pitaevskii equation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we analyze single vortex creation ramps with the cd quantum control .",
    "we consider four cases : linear and nonlinear ramps with and without the cd field .",
    "we compare the performance of these schemes to show that the nonlinear ramp with the cd protocol assisted by an optical plug yields the highest fidelity .",
    "furthermore , the effect of the condensate aspect ratio on the vortex creation fidelity is studied . in sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , we apply the results obtained in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] to vortex pumping .",
    "detailed density and phase profiles are studied for nonlinear ramps with the cd field .",
    "section  [ sec:4 ] is devoted to conclusions .",
    "the mean - field order parameter of the spin-1 bec is represented in the basis of the @xmath4-quantized spin states , @xmath5 , as @xmath6 , where the subscript in each spinor component denotes the magnetic quantum number along @xmath4 .",

    "the dynamics of the mean - field order parameter are solved in three dimensions employing the gross  pitaevskii ( gp ) equation @xmath11\\psi({{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r $ } } } , t),\\label{eq : hamiltonian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the external optical potential is given by @xmath12 , the harmonic part is @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the optical plug potential defined in the cylindrical coordinate system @xmath15 .",

    "imprinting scheme considered , we employ an external magnetic field consisting of a three - dimensional quadrupole field with an additional bias field along @xmath4 defined as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the strength of the gradient field and @xmath34 is the bias field component along @xmath4 . we have further defined @xmath35 .",
    "let us consider an atom at a point @xmath36 at time @xmath37 .",
    "in the presence of the magnetic field @xmath38 , considering only the zeeman term in the hamiltonian , @xmath39 , we have three eigenstates corresponding to the weak - field - seeking state ( wfss ) which has the highest energy , the neutral state ( ns ) with zero energy , and the strong - field - seeking state ( sfss ) which has the lowest energy . in the @xmath4-quantized basis",
    ", these eigenstates are represented as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the total magnetic field strength .",
    "in contrast to the earlier work in ref .",
    "@xcite , here we consider an optically trapped condensate and the magnetic field is primarly used only to control the spin state .",
    "hence , we are free to choose also the magnetically untrapped sfss as the initial state . under a strong bias field",
    "we have @xmath42 at the location of the atoms , and consequently the state is approximately @xmath43 .",
    "as the bias field is adiabatically ramped to a large negative value , such that @xmath44 , the state transforms into approximately @xmath45 .",
    "the appearance of the azimuthal dependence in the phase factor can be attributed to the accumulation of the berry phase during the adiabatic change of the bias field  @xcite .    while the bias field is inverted , there appears a space - time point where the magnetic field and hence zeeman energy gap between the eigenstates vanishes . near this point ,",
    "transitions from sfss to ns and wfss take place .",
    "however , atoms in the sfss are naturally repelled from the location of the magnetic field zero , which suppresses such transitions . due to this reason",
    ", we take sfss as the initial state in most of our simulations .",
    "additionally , we employ the optical plug in some of the simulations to further diminish the atom loss and to stabilize the resulting multi - quantum vortex  @xcite .      in an adiabatic process ,",
    "the populations in the instantaneous eigenstates of the time - dependent hamiltonian remain constant .",
    "if the system is not driven slow enough , transitions between the quantum states takes place .",
    "counter - diabatic protocol can be used to designate an auxiliary term in the hamiltonian to overcome the requirement of slow driving . in the cd protocol",
    ", the auxiliary term removes the nonadiabatic transitions and hence generates the same final state as the adiabatic process .",
    "@xcite    the dynamics of a spin-1 system in the presence of a changing magnetic field are described by the zeeman hamiltonian @xmath46 .",
    "the auxiliary hamiltonian provided by the cd scheme in this case is given by @xmath47 , where the so - called cd field reads @xmath48 .",
    "@xcite    in the following , we may approximate @xmath49 .",
    "thus the cd field in the topological vortex imprinting method , according to protocol in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bfield ] ) , assumes the form @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes the temporal derivative of the bias field .",
    "hence , the required external magnetic field including the cd field is thus @xmath52 .",
    "it is also possible to solve the cd field without setting @xmath53 , but it turns out to be of complex form and not likely conveniently realizable within the current experimental equipment .",
    "furthermore , we make the approximation @xmath54 in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : cd ] ) due to the requirement @xmath55 imposed by the maxwell s equations .    implementing",

    "the quadrupole field strength is linearly ramped on in the beginning of the simulations and off at the end of the simulations with the bias field kept constant .",
    "the ramp times for setting the quadrupole field on and off are both roughly 0.06 ms .",

[ fig : timedependence ] as a function of the ramp time @xmath59 .",
    "the effect of the cd field is most dramatic for brief ramps , i.e. , when the bias field is controlled in a nonadiabatic manner . for @xmath100  @xmath97s , both linear and nonlinear ramps without the optical plug",
    "give essentially the same result : the cd field improves the fidelity from almost zero to 0.1 and 0.3 for slightly and moderately oblate condensates , respectively . at longer times , @xmath101 , nonlinear ramp yields slightly higher fidelity since the zero of the field moves more slowly in the condensate region .",
    "the optical plug further enhances the fidelity for all ramp times , since the atoms are repelled from the path of the field zero .",

    "this is the case regardless whether we choose to include the cd field in the creation process or not . without the cd field",

    "in contrast , if @xmath105 is varied , the effective condensate width changes . due to the increase in the effective width , also the region",

    "after 20 cycles , the cd protocol yields an orbital angular momentum of approximately @xmath133 and @xmath134 with the initial conditions corresponding to wfss and sfss , respectively .",
    "this is a clear improvement compared with the case without the cd protocol , for which approximately @xmath135 is reached at the ninth cycle and @xmath136 is reached at the end of the twentieth cycle , for the initial conditions corresponding to wfss and sfss , respectively . in an ideal case , a 20-cycle vortex pumping process yields orbital angular momentum of @xmath137 , since each cycle provides an additional @xmath138 .",
    "this value is not achieved due to the nonadiabatic transitions occurring at every cycle between the different zeeman eigenstates .",
    "thus , the evolving state is a combination of wfss , ns , and sfss .    for wfss as an initial state , in the case without the cd field , the orbital angular momentum starts increasing roughly at the ninth cycle when sfss becomes the dominant state . for sfss as an initial state , it remains as the dominant state throughout the 20-cycle process .",
