    "the fractional differentiation and integration ( also called fractional calculus ) is a notion almost equally old as the ordinary differential and integral calculus .",
    "naturally , each a bit more gifted student who has just understood what is the first and second derivative can ask the question : _ well , but what is for example 1.5 - fold derivative ?",
    "_ there are several ways how to answer such a question .",
    "an excellent review on the theory of arbitrary order differentiation ( generally of complex order ) including also interesting historical notes and comprehensive list of references to original papers ( more than thousand items ) is given in the recently published monograph @xcite .",
    "some new results were presented also in the recent conference @xcite dedicated to this topic .",
    "the fractional calculus has also plenty of applications , see also e.g. @xcite,@xcite,@xcite and citations therein .",
    "possible use in quantum mechanics and the field theory is discussed in @xcite . recently ,",
    "fractional derivative was mentioned also in @xcite as a particular case of pseudo - differential operators applied in non - local field theory .    apparently , the general prescription for a definition of fractional derivative is using of some representation of ordinary _",
    "n - fold _ derivative ( primitive function ) which can be in some natural way interpolated to _",
    "n - non  integer .",
    "_ actually , following the mentioned monograph , all the known approaches are always somehow connected with some of the following relations .",
    "\\1 ) the well known formula for _ n - fold _ integral @xmath0 allows the substitution of @xmath1 by some real @xmath2 in this way fractional integration is introduced .",
    "then fractional derivatives can be obtained by ordinary differentiation of fractional integrals .",
    "this is the basis of the construction known as riemann - liouville fractional calculus .",
    "let us note , that in this approach resulting function even in the case of fractional derivatives in general depends on the fixing of the integration limit @xmath3 on the right hand side of ( [ i1 ] ) .",
    "\\2 ) the cauchy formula for analytic functions in some region of the complex plane @xmath4 in principle enables generalization to fractional derivatives , nevertheless the direct extension to _ non - integer _ values of @xmath1 leads to difficulties arising from multivaluedness of the term @xmath5 and the result also depends on the choice of the cut and integration curve .",
    "\\3 ) analytic continuation of derivative ( integral ) of exponential and power function @xmath6 obviously these relations allow to define fractional derivatives of the functions which can be expressed as linear combinations of power and exponential functions .",
    "also this approach is not completely consistent , as can be illustrated by fractional derivative of exponential function expanded to the power series @xmath7 but for @xmath8 _ non integer _",
    "@xmath9 so the task of extrapolation of integer derivative order to arbitrary one has not the unique solution .",
    "the approach proposed in this paper is based on the fractional derivative of the exponential function ( [ i3 ] ) entering the fourier transform of a given function . on this basis in sec.2 explicit form of the kernel of fractional derivative operator is deduced . in sec.3 the composition relation for the derivative operator is proved .",
    "the generalization of the case of the functions on the real axis to the case of function on the complex plane is done in sec.4 , which is concluded by theorem summarizing the results .",
    "the last section is devoted to the discussion of some consequences following from the theorem and to a comparison with the known approaches as well .",
    "let @xmath10 be a function having fourier picture @xmath11 @xmath12 then let us create the function @xmath13 and define @xmath14 the function @xmath15 can be formally expressed @xmath16 now let us calculate the integral ( [ eq3 ] ) , which depends on the way of passing about the singularity @xmath17 and choice of the branch and cut orientation of the function @xmath18 . for the beginning let us assume the cut is given by the half line either @xmath19 or @xmath20 . for complex functions",
    "@xmath21 we shall accept the phase convention @xmath22 i.e. it holds @xmath23 let us define @xmath24 if we accept phase convention ( [ eq6 ] ) for @xmath18 in the integral ( [ eq7 ] ) , then the uncertainty of phase of the expression ( [ eq7 ] ) is involved only in the factor @xmath25 \\pi ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath1 is any integer number . within arbitrariness given by ( [ eq8 ] ) the functions @xmath26 , @xmath27 do not depend on the cut orientation and it holds @xmath28{ll } d_{+}^\\alpha ( w)=0 & \\qquad   { \\rm for\\ } w<0 \\\\ d_{-}^\\alpha ( w)=0 & \\qquad { \\rm for\\ } w>0 , \\end{array}\\ ] ] which is evident from the corresponding integrals having the paths closed in infinity - for @xmath29 in upper ( lower ) half - plane .",

    "this substitution ensures absolute convergence of both integrals in ( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "next let us make in ( [ eq10 ] ) further substitution @xmath35 in this way instead of @xmath36 we get functions depending also on @xmath37 @xmath38 .\\ ] ] we assume      @xmath41 function values @xmath42 @xmath43 are considered values of one complex function @xmath44 in the two different points . according to the cut orientation of @xmath44 one can get either @xmath45 @xmath46 or @xmath45 @xmath47 .",
    "cut of the function @xmath44 is assumed @xmath48 latter on we shall come back to these assumptions and judge how they affected our result .",
    "assumptions concerning the cuts of @xmath18 , @xmath44 correspond to phases or to the intervals of phases of variables @xmath49 and correspondingly to phases of the variable @xmath50 .",
    "all considered possibilities are summarized in tab.[tb1 ]       the integrals of the all combinations summarized in the table can be expressed like ( [ a3 ] ) , @xmath52 if we denote @xmath53 then using identities ( [ a6a]),([a7 ] ) the sum ( [ a9 ] ) can be evaluated .",
    "the results are given in the last column of tab.[tba2 ] .",
    "let us compare the corresponding rows in upper and lower part of the table . obviously for any @xmath54",
    "one can write @xmath55 and equally for @xmath56 so far we have assumed ( [ a2 + ] ) , however using identity @xmath57 we can enlarge validity of ( [ a14 ] ) to any @xmath58 @xmath59 in this way we have proven the composition relation ( [ eq58 ] ) .",
