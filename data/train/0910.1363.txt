    "the study of various types of agn can provide insight into their origin and evolution .",
    "agn are classified according to their optical emission lines as type-1 or type-2 .",
    "type-1 agn have an unobscured  view of the hot accretion disk and broad emission lines originating from fast moving clouds that surround a supermassive black hole .",
    "type-2 objects are known as obscured  agn , because no broad lines or continuum emission from the accretion disk are observed , yet the spectra still show narrow emission lines similar to those of the type-1 objects .",
    "the interpretation of the differences between type-1 and type-2 quasars ( the most luminous agn ) remains an open issue .",
    "the orientation - based unification scheme proposes the two types of objects are intrinsically the same , but appear different observationally due to the presence of an obscuring torus of dust close to the central power source ( see antonucci 1993 ) .",
    "type-1 objects are seen from an orientation which allows an unobscured view of the central source .",
    "this allows the broad line region of the quasar to be observed .",
    "however , type-2 objects are seen through the dusty torus material , which hides the central continuum source and broad - line region .",
    "evidence that this model is at least partly correct comes from observations of polarized broad - line emission in galaxies classified as type-2 quasars ( e.g. ,  zakamska et al .",
    "but this model does not provide insight into the origin of quasar activity .",
    "an alternative model proposes that quasar activity is triggered by galactic mergers and evolves through an obscured stage @xcite . as the galaxies merge , gas and dust are stirred up , triggering quasar activity and star formation .",
    "initially the quasar would be obscured by the dust , but over time will become unobscured as dust and gas are blown away from the nuclear region by quasar and/or supernovae driven winds and radiation pressure .",
    "indeed , several host galaxy studies have been made which show that luminous agn are hosted by massive , mainly spheroid - dominated galaxies , with a significant fraction , but not all , showing signs of a relatively recent merger and associated star formation ( e.g. ,  dunlop et al .",
    "2003 ; canalizo et al . 2007 ;",
    "bennert et al .",
    "thus the evolution model predicts that the host galaxies of type-2 quasars should have more recent star forming activity than those of type-1s .",
    "although the discovery of polarized broad lines is a powerful argument in favor of the orientation - based model , it does not rule out an evolutionary link .",
    "the obscuring dust in a host galaxy would be apparent in its observed sed .",
    "dust close to the agn would be heated by the central power source and would thermally re - radiate in the mid - ir ( 100 - 1000k ) , dominating the rest - frame sed from @xmath02 - 40 .",
    "this high temperature dust emission makes the mid - ir seds of both optically - obscured and optically - unobscured agn quite distinct from those of either normal or starburst galaxies , whose dust temperatures are always @xmath1 100k . by modeling the various components of the seds , we can compare the relative amounts of `` cool '' , warm , and hot  dust emission present in the host galaxies .",
    "this will give us some idea of what mechanism dominates the heating of the dust ( star formation or agn ) , and how much of a role orientation might play in the observed seds .",
    "in this paper , we present modeled fits to the seds of a sample of type-1 and type-2 quasars of similar redshift and luminosity .",
    "@xcite presented preliminary fits to the type-2 quasars in this paper .",
    "we also measure the objects far - ir luminosities , pah luminosities , and estimate their star formation rates .",
    "we then compare the results with starburst galaxies .",
    "we describe the sample selection in  2 , and the observations and reductions in  3 . in ",
    "4 we present the analysis and results including our modeling procedure and resultant spectra , a color - color diagram , and star formation rate ( sfr ) calculations . finally , we summarize our results in  5 . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt the cosmological parameters of h@xmath2=71 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 , @xmath4=0.27 and @xmath5=0.73 .",
    "quasar surveys are now highly effective at finding quasars on the basis of their optical colors , provided they are not reddened or only lightly reddened by dust . with surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) ( schneider et al .",
    "2003 ) , 2df ( croom et al . 2004 ) , and combo-17 ( wolf et al .",
    "2003 ) , a census of such objects across the full range of quasar luminosities and redshifts out to z @xmath0 6 is largely complete .",
    "only recently have radio - quiet type-2 quasars been found in substantial numbers .",
    "however , there is still no consensus on how the dust - obscured quasars are related to the unobscured population . in particular",
    ", it is difficult to select matched samples of type-1 and type-2 objects with which to perform such studies . by using _",
    "data from the extragalactic first look survey ( xfls ) , we have been able to construct samples of type-1 and type-2 quasars matched in mid - ir luminosity and redshift .",
    "@xcite showed that quasars occupy a distinct sequence  of a _ spitzer _",
    "irac color - color plot ( their fig .  1 ) .",
    "follow - up spectroscopy of a sample of mid - ir selected agn and quasar candidates showed that about 2/3 of agn selected in this manner may be sufficiently obscured by dust in the optical to be missing from optically - selected quasar samples @xcite .",
    "we selected six type-2 quasars and six type-1 quasars ( see table  [ targets ] ) from the 1 mjy 8 @xmath6 m flux - limited sample of @xcite , with similar mid - ir colors and 5.8  luminosities .",
    "these objects are approximately matched in mid - ir luminosity .",
    "our modeling ( see  [ modeling ] ) shows they have mid - ir power - law luminosities within a factor of five from each other .",
    "furthermore , the observed frame 24  luminosities of the type-1 and type-2 quasars are not statistically different from each other .",
    "it is important that the sample be matched in luminosity , since the quasar luminosity will affect the rate at which dust and gas is removed from the nuclear region .",
    "we supplement data from the _ spitzer _ extragalactic first look survey ( xfls ) @xcite with targeted observations in the 70  and 160  using the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ) .",
    "each of our targets was detected at the 24  wavelength in the _ spitzer _ xfls .",
    "five of our targets were detected in the 70  xfls mosaic , and we measured the 70  fluxes for two other targets directly from the xfls mosaic image .",
    "the remaining five targets of our sample were not detected in the 70  xfls mosaic and so required targeted observations .",
    "we observed each of these targets for 500 seconds .",
    "all of the targets were observed with the mips 160  band for 2000 seconds each .",
    "the photometric data were reduced through the standard _ spitzer _ mips pipeline .",
    "we used the post basic calibrated ( post - bcd ) filtered mosaic images to measure the flux of each target .",
    "the pixel scales of the post - bcd mips images are 4 arcsec pixel^-1^ at 70  and 8 arcsec pixel^-1^ at 160  .",
    "we also observed each target using the short - low and long - low resolution modes with the _ spitzer _ infrared spectrograph ( irs ) .",
    "the spectra were reduced through the standard _",
    "spitzer _ pipeline .",
    "we manually masked the bad pixels in the background subtracted spectra ( difference between nodded exposure positions ) using the idl program irsclean .",
    "we then extracted the spectra using the standard point source extraction in the _ spitzer _ spice software tool , and combined the individual spectra to create a continuous mid - ir spectrum for each target .",
    "lastly we included photometry measured from our mips data ( table [ targets ] ) and data available for our targets from sdss , 2mass and _ spitzer _ irac observations ( table [ mphot ] ) to produce an observed frame sed that ranges from optical through the infrared .",
    "we used the daophot package in iraf to measure the 70  and 160  fluxes of our targets .",
    "for the 70  measurements we examined each image individually and determined the best aperture and sky annulus that maximized the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we then applied aperture corrections from the _ spitzer _ space telescope mips data handbook , and compared the measured flux to a 3@xmath7 limit obtained by measuring the noise in the image .",
    "each of our 12 targets was observed in the 160  mips band , though many of our targets were not detected at this wavelength .",
    "we chose an example image with a strong detection and determined the aperture and sky annulus sizes that maximized the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we used those parameters while measuring the other images with bright detections .",
    "the same procedure was used for the images with targets that were not detected .",
    "we then compared the measured fluxes of each of the targets to the 3@xmath7 limit determined from the noise in the image .",
    "five of the 12 targets have fluxes less than the 2@xmath7 noise limit , and we count them as non - detections .",
    "five other targets have fluxes @xmath82@xmath7 , and only one has 160  flux @xmath83@xmath7 .",
    "the remaining target is discussed following .",
    "the target sdss 1711 + 5855 required special attention , because there was a bright object near the target .",
    "we fit a psf using several other bright objects in the image , then subtracted sources from the image leaving only our target .",
    "we then measured the flux of sdss 1711 + 5855 from the subtracted image .",
    "this procedure was successful at 70 , but our attempts at removing the extra source at 160  resulted in an image with significant residuals .",
    "therefore , we only report an upper limit measured from the combined flux of the objects at 160 .",

    "these classifications are dominated by seyferts , starbursts , and ulirgs , respectively .",
    "our type-1 quasars have spectra most similar to the 1a classification of galaxies by spoon et al .",
    "the variation of silicate absorption strengths in the type-2 spectra of our sample is also consistent with that seen by @xcite , who study a sample of optically selected type-2 quasars from the sdss .",

    "interpreted this correlation to indicate that the silicate dust resides in the host galaxy , and not the nuclear region .",
    "the objects of @xcite show no correlation , and they propose this could be a difference in samples due to selection biases based on luminosity .",
    "we modeled the seds of our sample from the optical out to the far - ir .",
    "we used available sdss and 2mass photometry , irac bands 1 and 2 ( 3.6  and 4.5 , respectively ) photometry @xcite and our _ spitzer _ irs mid - ir spectra and mips photometry .",

    "the modeling code is described by @xcite .",
    "modifications to the code to enable modeling of the type-2 objects in our sample were briefly described by @xcite . here",
    "we provide a fuller description of the modeling , and the additional modifications required to fit the type-1 objects .",
    "the modeling is phenomenological in nature due to the current lack of a good physical understanding of the nature and geometry of the dust emitting regions , particularly in the mid - ir , thus many of the parameters do not have a direct physical interpretation .",
    "nevertheless , we considered the effort worthwhile as it allows an empirical breakdown of the contributions of starlight , hot dust emission from the agn , and cooler dust emission .",

    "( 1 ) a single stellar population from @xcite with an age of 5 gyr to represent the evolved stellar population . ( 2 ) a power - law component for the mid - ir emission , with an exponential cutoff at short wavelengths to represent dust sublimation , and a fermi function cutoff at long wavelengths designed to match the sed shape of the least star - forming object in the sample of type-2s , sst 1721 + 6012 .",
    "the functional form used was :    @xmath10    where the normalization , @xmath11 , power - law index @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( a proxy for the sublimation temperature ) are allowed to vary , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 were fixed at @xmath16hz and @xmath17hz , respectively ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the planck and boltzman constants , respectively )",
    ". the galactic center extinction curve of @xcite was then applied to this continuum to fit any silicate absorption feature .",
    "( 3 ) a warm dust component to represent the small grain emission from hii regions , represented by a power - law with fixed high and low frequency cutoffs :    @xmath20    this component is poorly constrained in most of the fits , so @xmath21 was fixed at a typical value of two ( e.g.  sajina et al .",
    "the high and low frequency cutoffs , @xmath22 and @xmath23 were set to @xmath24hz and @xmath25hz , respectively .",
    "( 4 ) a thermal modified blackbody model for the far - infrared emission :    @xmath26    for most objects , we fixed the temperature of this component , @xmath27 , to 45k , because of the uncertainty in our 160  photometry .",
    "@xmath28 was fixed at 1.5 .",
    "in addition , the pah model described in @xcite was added when evidence of pah emission was seen , and sst 1721 + 6012 had a silicate emission profile added , whose shape was approximated by that of the extinction curve .    for the type-1 quasars , component ( 1 ) was replaced by an sdss composite quasar spectrum .",
    "as the composite of @xcite  suffers from noticeable host galaxy contamination at the long wavelength end , we constructed a new composite by subtracting the continuum from the composite of vanden berk et al . , and adding the residual emission line composite to a new continuum constructed using line - free sed points from the composite of @xcite .",
    "most type-1 objects also required an extra near - infrared component to match the seds .",
    "this `` very hot '' component was modeled as a 1000 k modified blackbody ( eq .  [ fireq ]  with @xmath29 ) .",
    "the physical origin of this component is unclear , but it is most likely due to hot dust close to the sublimation radius ( e.g.  netzer et al .",
    "@xcite show that the strength of this component correlates with quasar luminosity .",
    "we do not find this to be true for our sample , but note that @xcite have a much larger sample size spread over a range of luminosities .",
    "the modeling results for the type-1 objects are presented in fig .",
    "[ type1s ] , and the results for the type-2 objects are presented in fig .",
    "[ type2s ] .",
    "several differences between the type-1 sample and the type-2 sample are immediately apparent from the fitting results .",
    "the type-1 objects have a strong optical quasar component that can extend significantly into the mid - ir .",
    "the 1000 k component is significant in all six type-1s and also contributes to the mid - ir .",
    "three of the six type-1 object seds showed no evidence of the warm small grain dust power - law emission .",
    "the type-2 object seds are dominated in the mid - ir by hot dust with no contribution from the optical stellar light and no evidence for the 1000 k component . also present in the mid - ir portion of the type-2 objects",
    "is a variety of pah emission and silicate absorption .",
    "five of the six type-2 objects have significant contributions to the mid and far - ir from the warm small grain dust power - law .",
    "sst 1721 + 6012 was the only type-2 not fit well with this component .",
    "we note that the results of the fitting procedure for the object sst 1724 + 5915 underestimate both the observed amount of pah emission and the far - ir emission .",
    "this is likely due to the large amount of silicate absorption also present in the spectrum of the object .",
    "in particular the 9.7  absorption feature can affect the shape of the 7.7  pah feature , making it difficult to fit with an empirical template .",
    "we include the data in our subsequent analysis , but note that star formation rates derived from the far - ir emission and the pah emission likely underestimate the true star formation of this object ( see  [ sfrs ] ) .",
    "we averaged the modeled type-1 seds and type-2 seds to highlight the differences between the two samples .",
    "we first normalized the sed of each target at 24  to ensure each object had equal weight . by chosing to normalize at 24",
    "we can compare the relative amounts of hot and cool dust in the averaged seds .",
    "though at 24 , extinction is still present , it is significantly reduced compared to shorter wavelengths .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ average ] that on average type-2 objects show more pah emission , more silicate absorption and more far - ir emission than type-1 objects .",
    "in addition , while the very hot 3  bump is clear in the type-1 spectrum , no bump is seen in the type-2 spectrum .",
    "we note the caveat that the type-1 and type-2 objects could have equivalent amounts of pah emission if that emission were significantly diluted by a strong mid - ir continuum in type-1 objects .",
    "the important question is if these observed differences could arise solely due to orientation effects . in that scenario",
    "the optical through mid - ir light is absorbed and re - radiated in the far - ir . to test this , we integrated the optical through far - ir fluxes of the normalized and averaged spectra and found them to be identical .",
    "these results are consistent with the orientation hypothesis , though the geometry and distribution of the obscuring dust can not be proved from this simple test .",
    "furthermore , under the orientation hypothesis , the dust tori of the type-1 and type-2 quasars should have the same intrinsic luminosities .",
    "our modeling results show that the tori of the type-2 quasars are slightly more luminous than the tori of the type-1 quasars , though the difference is not statistically significant .",
    "this may be a result of our mid - ir selection technique , as those wavelengths are still somewhat affected by extinction . in the next section",
    "we examine the pah emission and the star formation contribution to the far - ir emission to gain more insight into whether the far - ir emission is different between the two objects .",

    "if taken at face value , these numbers indicate that some of the cool far - ir emitting dust is heated by agn emission instead of stellar emission .    in table",

    "we calculated sfrs in two different ways .",
    "first , we converted the integrated warm and cold dust components of our model into sfrs using the @xcite calibration for starburst galaxies :    @xmath37 = 4.5 \\times 10^{-44}l'_{fir}~[erg~s^{-1}]\\ ] ]    although our objects have ir luminosities similar to those of ulirgs , their sfrs are lower than those of typical ulirgs .",
    "this is because some of the ir luminosity of our objects is due to agn - heated dust , and we explicitly exclude this component when calculating sfrs .",
    "the sfrs of our sample are instead typical of lirgs , which can range from @xmath38 m@xmath39 yr@xmath3 ( e.g. ,  sanders et al .",
    "we find that the type-2 objects show higher sfrs on average ( 92 m@xmath39 yr@xmath3 ) than the type-1 objects ( 67 m@xmath39 yr@xmath3 ) .",
    "however , the scatter is large , and the object with the lowest sfr is a type-2 , sst 1721 + 6012 .",
    "we also independently calculated the sfr from the pah emission .",
    "this can be done by predicting a far - ir luminosity based on the pah luminosity .",
    "we integrated our scaled pah template to measure the pah luminosity of each object in our sample .",

    "\\(3 ) our averaged and normalized modeled spectra show that type-2 quasars exhibit more far - ir emission than type-1 quasars .",
    "the excess is roughly equivalent to the deficit in the optical with respect to the type-1 quasars , which is consistent with the orientation hypothesis . in this scenario",
    "the increased far - ir emission arises from obscuring dust that is reradiating absorbed light .",
    "\\(4 ) we measured l@xmath31 by integrating our scaled template for each object .",
    "we compared the typical l@xmath31 to l@xmath30 ratio of our sample to that of starburst galaxies that have had l@xmath31 measured in a similar manner as the method we used . within our sample",

    "considering our overall sample , we found that the ratio is smaller than for the starburst galaxies @xcite .",
    "this result suggests some far - ir emitting dust can be warmed by the central agn rather than by young stars .",
    "however , a more direct comparison between agn and starburst galaxies using larger samples would be needed to further quantify the amount of agn - heated far - ir emitting dust .",
    "\\(5 ) we calculated the sfrs of our sample using two methods .",
    "first we integrated the warm small grain and cool modified blackbody emission ( excluding all other components ) of the modeled seds and used the @xcite relation to calculate the sfrs .",
    "we also converted the l@xmath31 to l@xmath32 @xcite to measure the sfrs based on the pah emission only . in each case",
    "the type-2 objects had higher sfr on average than the type-1 objects . however , the difference is not significant given the scatter .",
    "\\(6 ) we integrated our modeled seds from @xmath44  and found that seven of the 12 can be considered ulirgs ( log(l@xmath45l@xmath35 ) @xmath46 ) , while four others have log(l@xmath34/l@xmath35 ) @xmath47 .",
    "the sole exception is sst 1721 + 6012 , which has log(l@xmath45l@xmath35 ) @xmath48 .",
    "while our sample appears to have ir luminosities similar to ulirgs , the quasars exhibit sfrs more typical of lirgs .",
    "we found the agn can heat most of the dust in the mid - ir and even some in the far - ir .",
    "thus measuring sfr in quasars from the full @xmath44  sed overestimates the amount of dust warmed by young stars and the true sfr .",
    "\\(7 ) the modeling results suggest that type-1 quasars can have mid - ir fluxes that have significant contributions from the optical power - law and 3  bump .",
    "this 3  component is not required for the type-2 seds , and the hot dust most likely originates near the sublimation radius of the agn .",
    "if this component is present in the type-2 quasars , it must be at least partially obscured by cooler dust , either a dusty torus or dust in the host galaxy .",
    "@xcite showed that the host galaxies of the type-2 quasars have a range of inclinations . therefore ,",
    "the obscuration of the 3  bump , if it is intrinsically present , should be from material close to the nucleus and independent of galaxy orientation .",
    "while our analysis does not distinguish definitively between orientation and evolution based unification schemes , it does directly address the dust content , ongoing star formation in the host galaxies and the agn contribution to the far - ir emission .",
    "our results are consistent with the orientation hypothesis , but we can not rule out an evolutionary connection . the star formation based on pah measurements is a larger contributor to the far - ir luminosity than the agn for type-2 objects compared to type-1 objects . this difference is only suggestive due to the scatter of both l@xmath31 and l@xmath30 in our sample and could arise from intrinsic differences in the bolometric luminosities of the objects . the l@xmath31/l@xmath30 ratio in both type-1 and type-2 quasars is lower than that of starburst galaxies , suggesting that some emission in the far - ir is from dust heated by the agn and not star formation .",
    "this is an area for continued research , as our analysis was based on few objects .",
