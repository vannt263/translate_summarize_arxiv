    "<S> pacs numbers : 05.45.pq , 02.30.-f , 71.30.+h , 71.55.jv    anomalous transport in non - periodic structures is due to intricate quantum interferences which may also lead to localization of wave functions . </S>",
    "<S> another possibility is ballistic motion , mainly related to periodic structures . </S>",
    "<S> here we consider transport properties in nearest - neighbours tight - binding models in  @xmath0 whose general hamiltonian @xmath1 is given by @xmath2 with  @xmath3 and potentials @xmath4 generated by some non - periodic substitution sequences .    among the characterizations of ( de)localization and transport we single out the ( average ) moments of the `` position '' operator @xmath5 and the ( average ) return probability @xmath6 in relations  ( [ moments ] )  and  ( [ return ] ) it is implicitly assumed that the initial condition is @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> both quantities @xmath8 and @xmath9 have strong physical appeal and in some cases are attainable to theoretical and numerical investigations . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that the return probability was one of the first quantities considered in the seminal paper by anderson on localization in disordered structures  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it has been found that for large @xmath10  @xcite @xmath11 localization should be characterized by vanishing exponents @xmath12 and @xmath13 , ballistic motion by @xmath14 , while anomalous transport by @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> notice that @xmath16 is related to the direct conductivity via the anomalous drude formula  @xcite .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we consider potentials @xmath17 in  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) generated by some substitution sequences and compute the exponent for the decay of the return probability as a function of the degree of randomness of those sequences . </S>",
    "<S> as it will be seen later , in most cases  @xmath13 can not be obtained directly from numerical integration of the time - dependent schrdinger equation ; namely , the standard fitting procedure given by equation  ( [ exponents ] ) works only for the well - investigated case of fibonacci potentials ( to be defined below ) . </S>",
    "<S> we then propose an alternative approach , based on the energy spectral decomposition of the initial quantum state , which not only is able to retrieve the known fibonacci results but permits us to exhibit an effective exponent also for other non - periodic substitution potentials such as thue - morse , rudin - shapiro , paperfolding and period doubling ( see below for their precise descriptions ) . </S>",
    "<S> the main conclusion will be that there is no perfect correspondence of the exponent ruling the algebraic decay of the return probability and the degree of randomness of the own substitution sequences , as one expects based on general considerations ( i.e. , more random the sequence smaller such exponent ) . </S>",
    "<S> now we proceed to the details of the points just outlined , including a justification for the choice of  @xmath13 as our exponent of interest </S>",
    "<S> .    the rage theorem and wiener lemma give direct physical meaning to the standard types of spectra , i.e. , point and continuous ( absolutely and singular ) in the sense that one of their corollaries is that for continuous spectra @xmath18 and @xmath19 , while for point spectra @xmath20 ; it is left room for @xmath21 even for point spectra due to the tail of eigenfunctions and domain intricateness  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the determination of such exponents is a quantitative step from rage and wiener lemma which , by its turn , is still related to deep spectral quantities , i.e. , generalized dimensions of the ( positive ) spectral measures associated to the initial state  @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> it has been rigorously proven that @xmath23 is bounded from below by the information dimension @xmath24  @xcite ( all dimensions are related to the corresponding spectral measure ) and also conjectured that @xmath25 ( @xmath26 denotes the fractal dimension of the spectrum ) . </S>",
    "<S> in an interesting paper guarneri and mantica  @xcite have presented examples of homogeneous fractal spectral measures , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , with generalized dimensions @xmath27 for any @xmath28 , for which @xmath23 is not constant and no simple exact relation seems to hold between the thermodynamics of the spectrum and the exponent @xmath12 , so that `` multiscaling does not require multifractality ''  @xcite ; this was called quantum intermitency in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> see  @xcite for some recent results on a particular class of systems and other references .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , it was rigorously proven  @xcite that the exponent  @xmath13 ruling the algebraic decay of the return probability equals the correlation dimension  @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that such relation supposes the limit defining the dimension  @xmath29 does exist . </S>",
    "<S> see also  @xcite where this relation was first proposed in the context of anomalous diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we have selected the return probability , its corresponding exponent  @xmath13 and correlation dimension  @xmath29 , as the main tools for analyzing our systems .    </S>",
    "<S> relevant examples of anomalous diffusion are generated by almost - periodic potentials @xmath17 ; an important class of such potentials is given by @xmath17 induced by non - periodic ( primitive ) substitution sequences  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these sequences form a convenient laboratory for the study of anomalous transport since in all rigorously analyzed cases they generate singular continuous spectra for the tight - binding model  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , although the own spectral types of substitution sequences are not equal ; for example , fibonacci ( fcc ) , paperfolding ( pf ) and period doubling ( pd ) substitution sequences have point autocorrelation measures , thue - morse ( tm ) has singular continuous autocorrelation measure , and the autocorrelation measure of rudin - shapiro ( rs ) substitution sequence is absolutely continuous . </S>",
    "<S> although all these sequences are almost periodic , their spectral properties characterize them qualitatively from `` ordered to random '' since periodic and quasiperiodic sequences have pure point autocorrelation measures ( as fcc , pf and pd do ) , whereas independent random sequences have absolutely continuous autocorrelation measures ( as rs does ) . </S>",
    "<S> the tm sequence lies in an intermediate place . </S>",
    "<S> it is also worth noting that all these sequences give rise to strictly ergodic dynamical systems with zero topological and generalized entropy  @xcite .    due to different degrees of randomness of the substitution sequences </S>",
    "<S> , it was expected differences in the spectral properties of the corresponding tight - binding hamiltonians  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , but as already commented above all rigorously studied cases have presented singular continuous spectrum  @xcite ( the rs case is an important open problem  @xcite ; the pf case is also open ) . </S>",
    "<S> our main goal in this letter is to investigate whether the spectral character of the sequence generating the potential is responsible for different physics through details of the return probability behaviour . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we consider potentials @xmath17 in  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) generated by the five non - periodic sequences fcc , pf , pd , tm and rs . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13 can be computed either from numerical integration of the time - dependent schrdinger equation , and then fitting a straight line on @xmath30 , or directly computing @xmath29 from its definition ( which also involves a straight line fitting  see below ) . however , as already anticipated , we have faced problems in linear fittings in both procedures ( except for the well - investigated case of fcc potentials ) and we propose a pragmatic approach to get such exponents which is able to recover the fcc known results .    </S>",
    "<S> now we present the rules describing the sequences we use to generate @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> fcc , pd and tm sequences are constructed with an alphabet of two letters @xmath31 through the substitutions @xmath32 @xmath33 beginning with @xmath34 and applying successively the substitution rules , non - periodic sequences are obtained ; e.g. , the thue - morse sequence is given by @xmath35 the rs and pf sequences can be obtained with an alphabet of four letters @xmath36 , the substitutions @xmath37 @xmath38 and then the identifications @xmath39 and @xmath40 in both cases ; the first elements of the rs sequence are @xmath41    we then use these substitution sequences to define our potentials @xmath17 ; we take @xmath42 if the @xmath43-th letter of the sequence is @xmath34 and @xmath44 in case it is @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> there are standard ways to extend the potential for negative values of  @xmath43  @xcite , but we avoid such issue by taking a finite sample of @xmath46 sites , with @xmath47 , and using the initial wavefunction  @xmath48 . in this way we construct the almost - periodic substitution potentials @xmath49 and investigate  @xmath13 as function of the degree of randomness of the potential and its intensity @xmath50 .    </S>",
    "<S> it is known that fcc , pd and tm generate potentials whose spectra of  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) are singular continuous for all @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the case of rs has been numerically investigated in  @xcite indicating point spectrum for @xmath52 and mixed spectrum , i.e. , point and singular continuous , for @xmath53 ( notice we use a scale for the potential values which is different from  @xcite ) . for hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) with pf potential it is only known that its spectrum has no absolutely continuous component , since it is primitive  @xcite ; from a rigorous point of view the lack / presence of eigenvalues in this case is also an open question .    </S>",
    "<S> the case of fcc hamiltonian has also been considered in  @xcite and a good agreement between the value of @xmath13 from numerical integration of schrdinger equation and @xmath29 was found . </S>",
    "<S> let s recall the definition of @xmath29 associated to a spectral measure  @xmath54 and how it is usually estimated  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . for @xmath55 let @xmath56 denote the open ball of centre @xmath57 and radius  @xmath58 and set @xmath59 the correlation dimension of  @xmath54 is given by the limit @xmath60 if this limit does not exist one defines  @xmath61 and  @xmath62 via @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the latter remark is important here since we have found numerical indications that the limit in the definition  ( [ d2 ] ) does not exist for general substitution potentials . in numerical practice </S>",
    "<S> we have a finite basis approximation for  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) whose spectrum is composed of eigenvalues  @xmath65 ; then we divide the energy range into boxes  @xmath66 of length  @xmath67 , approximate @xmath68 and get @xmath29 from the linear fitting of @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath70 is the projection of the initial wavefunction  @xmath22 on the eigenvector with eigenvalue  @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> we have used these procedures to recover  @xmath29 and  @xmath13 found in  @xcite for the  fcc case as illustrated in figure  1 . </S>",
    "<S> however such techniques do not work for substitution potentials distinct from fcc ( as far as we have checked ) , since no clear region with linear behavior is found in the plots @xmath69 and @xmath71 , as exemplified in figure  2 for the pd potential with @xmath72 . </S>",
    "<S> we suspect this behaviour is an indication that the limits defining the scale exponents @xmath29 and @xmath13 are not well defined in such situations ; then we propose a pragmatic approach to extract effective exponents @xmath29 by selecting a particular value  @xmath73 of @xmath67 . before presenting our approach </S>",
    "<S> we stress we have also tried to get well - defined exponents by site averaging on samples beginning at locations @xmath74 , but quite similar behaviours were found .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin our argument with the remark that if @xmath67 is smaller than the least eigenvalue spacing ( we just ignore the possibility of degenerate eigenvalues in this argument ) then @xmath75 which resembles the so - called inverse participation ratio ( which does not depend on  @xmath67 ) ; this also gives a physical interpretation for @xmath29 . as a naive first guess for </S>",
    "<S> an effective exponent one could try to use @xmath76 instead of @xmath77 , but the exact value of @xmath67 to be used in an approximation to  ( [ d2 ] ) is not clear at all . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical determination of @xmath29 involves the limit @xmath78 ; finite basis approximations preclude this limit and also too small values of @xmath67 are meaningless , despite the inverse participation ratio interpretation . </S>",
    "<S> for sufficient small values of @xmath67 we have @xmath79 we suggest to pick @xmath73 as the smallest value of @xmath67 such that the l.h.s </S>",
    "<S> . of  ( [ divisao ] ) considerably deviates from  @xmath80 , so still keeping track of @xmath77 and also the inverse participation ratio interpretation in operation . </S>",
    "<S> then we estimate the effective  @xmath29 as  @xmath81 given by @xmath82 let s be more precise on how we have picked up  @xmath73 in practice . by using double precision ( 16 digits ) in our code </S>",
    "<S> , we adopted that after diagonalization we can numerically resolve the spectral quantities with 8 digits , i.e. , half of the number of digits of the code precision , so that  @xmath73 is given by the smallest value of  @xmath67 such that @xmath83 or , equivalently , the smallest  @xmath67 such that @xmath84 we remark that in most cases  @xmath73 can also be obtained directly from visual inspection , as in figure  2b , and the precise value  @xmath85 is not so relevant since in general  @xmath77 has a pronounced jump at  @xmath86 .    </S>",
    "<S> we have tested our approach in the fcc case and have got very good agreement with the computed values of @xmath29 from our linear fittings and the values reported in  @xcite . in figure  2b </S>",
    "<S> we show a typical curve used to estimate @xmath73 , and in figure  3 we compare the values of the exponents @xmath13 and @xmath29 as calculated in figure  1 and also the matching values of @xmath81 from equation  ( [ epsstar ] ) for the fcc case . from now on we use this procedure to estimate the exponents  @xmath81 for the other substitution hamiltonians  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) considered here .    </S>",
    "<S> its now time to discuss our numerical results and details of their implementations . </S>",
    "<S> the return probability @xmath9 was calculated by direct diagonalization of the hamiltonian and eigenfunction expansion of the initial state ; we used bases of size  @xmath87 and checked some results with bases of size  @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> the initial condition was always concentrated on the centre of the basis  @xmath89 and we have followed its time evolution until time  @xmath90 for which the modulus of the amplitude at one of the border sites reaches  @xmath91 . for the calculation of  @xmath29 we have considered subdivisions of the spectrum in subintervals of size  @xmath67 ranging from the least eigenvalues spacing ( we disregarded multiple eigenvalues ) up to  @xmath92 . we could seldom conceive a linear behaviour in such  @xmath93 plots in both  @xmath29 and  @xmath13 cases in order to extract faithful exponents , so that we were left with the task of finding  @xmath73 and computing only  @xmath94 .    in figure  4 we present a summary of our main numerical results , i.e. , the values of  @xmath94 for some substitution potentials as function of the potential intensity  @xmath50 . since we are not aware of any complete rigorous spectral classification for hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) in the cases of  rs and pf sequences , </S>",
    "<S> we have also used  @xmath90 as indication of any possible ( de)localization transition ; this is the reason for the restriction of the rs case to  @xmath95 ; for all substitution sequences we have found  @xmath96 for  @xmath97 , but for rs  @xmath90 jumps from  @xmath98 for  @xmath99 to  @xmath100 for  @xmath101 , which characterizes absence ( at least numerically ) of extended states . if non - localized states are present their `` amounts '' suffer a drastic reduction at  @xmath102 so that we have not detected them . recall that in  @xcite it is argued that all states of rs hamiltonian should be localized for  @xmath103 .    since no such sharp transition in  @xmath90 </S>",
    "<S> was found for the pf hamiltonian , its values of  @xmath94 are close to the corresponding values for pd , and both substitution sequences have point autocorrelation measures , we conjecture that the pf hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) has singular continuous spectrum for  @xmath104 ( maybe also for any @xmath105 ) as pd hamiltonian does  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> besides the above conjecture we see from figure  4 that for all sequences the exponent  @xmath94 decreases as  @xmath50 increases ( as physically expected ) . </S>",
    "<S> since different exponents were found despite the proven singular continuous spectra of fcc , tm and pd hamiltonians , we see that  @xmath94 is able to discern these operators . </S>",
    "<S> the values of  @xmath94 for the rs are very close to the tm case , but in principle one would not expect this since the autocorrelation measure of the rs sequence is lebesgue measure ( the same for random sequences ) . notice that the spectral classification of the underlying sequence generating the potential does not reflect exactly in  @xmath94 , since these values for pf and pd are below the corresponding ones for tm and rs , the latter sequences being considered `` more random '' than the former ones . </S>",
    "<S> notice , however , that for the most popular sequences fcc , tm and rs we have found agreements with the classification through the sequence spectral type , i.e. , this order implying decreasing values of  @xmath94 </S>",
    "<S> .    the higher values of the exponents for rs compared to pd indicates that the presence of extended states mixed with numerically found localized states  @xcite does not necessarily imply lower exponents  @xmath94 .    </S>",
    "<S> summing up , we have found that for substitution potentials in general the dynamical exponent  @xmath13 and the correlation dimension  @xmath29 are difficult to be obtained from direct linear fittings ( at least with the basis sizes we used ; we suspect this is a consequence of the quantum intermitency and multiscaling in time of the dynamics  @xcite ) and we have proposed  @xmath94 as an effective exponent , which has recovered  @xmath29 in the cases it can be directly obtained . </S>",
    "<S> we then computed  @xmath94 for some substitution potentials and have not found a complete qualitative agreement with the spectral type of the substitution sequences themselves , i.e. , more random the sequence smaller  @xmath29 . only for rs </S>",
    "<S> we have got indications of a spectral transition from extended ( critical ) to localized states , although its values of  @xmath94 are higher than those for pd and pf cases .      </S>",
