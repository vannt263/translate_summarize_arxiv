    "the cranked shell model ( csm ) approach @xcite accounts well for the overall systematics of bandcrossing phenomena in rapidly rotating medium and heavy mass nuclei . in this model",
    "the protons and neutrons move independently in a fixed rotating potential . as a consequence of this assumption ,",
    "the alignment of a pair of neutrons with the rotational axis occurs at the same rotational frequency for different proton configurations .",
    "however , recently substantial deviations from this simple picture have been reported using the csm approach in the high - spin study of nuclei near @xmath0 @xcite and for nuclei with aligning neutrons and protons occupying the same intruder subshell @xcite . these deviations , concerning the crossing between the g - band and the s - band in the even - neutron systems referred to as the ( ab)-crossing , include :    * the crossing in the odd - proton nuclei",
    "is considerably delayed as compared to the neighboring even - even nuclei , * in the case of @xmath0 even - even nuclei , the ( ab)-crossing is substantially delayed as compared to the neighboring @xmath1 .",
    "[ f : crossex ] summarizes the experimental evidence .",
    "the observed delay of the neutron alignment has been attributed to an increase of the deformation induced by the odd high-@xmath2 proton .",
    "this mechanism has first been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite as the possible origin of the delayed @xmath3 neutron backbend if an @xmath4 proton is present .",
    "it has been substantiated by systematic calculations of the equilibrium deformations for bands with an odd - proton in the @xmath5 , @xmath4 and @xmath3 orbitals ( cf . e. g. @xcite ) . though being in the right order of magnitude , the calculations tend to underestimate the experimental shifts .",
    "the p - n residual interaction has been invoked to be responsible for the remaining discrepancy @xcite . in a study of a qq- type p - n interaction acting in the particle - hole channel ref .",
    "@xcite finds only very small shifts . in the pesent paper",
    "we further investigate the role of the residual interaction .",
    "at variance with ref .",
    "@xcite , we use a short range force and calculate the exact solutions for the model system of interacting protons and neutrons in a @xmath2 shell , exposed to a deformed potential .    the strong short - range proton - neutron ( p - n ) attraction probes the relative orientation of the high-@xmath2 orbitals , because of their strongly anisotropic , torus like density distributions .",
    "it favors the anti parallel ( @xmath6 ) and the parallel ( @xmath7 ) coupling of a p - n pair , the energies being comparable .",
    "since there are many low-@xmath8 pairs available , they tend to form a correlated state ( p - n pairing ) .",
    "processes in which the high-@xmath2 particles change their relative orientation should be good means to study these aspects of the p - n interaction . in this manuscript",
    ", we investigate a special kind of such reorientation , the alignment of a pair of neutrons with the axis of rotation . by means of a shell model calculation",
    "it will be demonstrated that the rotational frequency at which the neutron alignment occurs changes when additional protons are present and that the frequency shift are sensitive to the p - n interaction and the correlations it generates .",
    "it will also be shown that the p - n interaction causes a delay of the first double - bandcrossing in @xmath0 model systems studied as compared to cases with @xmath9 which may be related to the delayed bandcrossing observed in @xmath0 nuclei @xcite .",
    "in our model the protons and neutrons in a @xmath2-shell interact via a delta force and move in the deformed rotating potential generated by the nucleons outside the @xmath2-shell .",
    "the model hamiltonian is the same as used in refs .",
    "@xcite , where one may look for the details , and is given by @xmath10 - g \\sum_{i < j } \\delta(|\\hat r_i-\\hat r_j|).\\ ] ] the first term is the deformed quadrupole field where @xmath11 is related to the deformation parameter @xmath12 by @xmath13 in units of the coupling strength @xmath14 of the delta force .",
    "the second , cranking term describes the uniform rotation about the x - axis with the frequency @xmath15 and the third term is the interaction .",
    "the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian are found by numerical diagonalization .",
    "they can be classified by the isospin and the signature ( symmetry with respect to @xmath16 ) which are conserved by the model hamiltonian .",
    "we would like to point that the present model predictions should only be considered as qualitative indications of the physics expected from more realistic studies .",
    "the major restriction of our model is that we consider only few particles occupying the intruder subshell with rest of the nucleons giving rise to a deformed potential .",
    "the assumption that the nucleons outside the intruder shell do not take part in the correlations generated by the short range residual interaction seems to be the most serious restriction of the model . since we choose a realistic value of the deformation for a given nucleus and estimate the number of particles occupying the high-@xmath2 orbital by looking at the realistic nilsson diagrams , the estimates of the frequency where the rotational alignment occurs should be qualitatively right . as a consequence of the restriction to a single @xmath2-shell , the total angular momentum is underestimated .",
    "this is of little importance , because we study the _ frequency _ of the alignment processes , which will not be changed by the missing angular momentum from the nucleons outside the @xmath2-shell .",
    "[ f : crossdef11 ] shows the expectation value of the @xmath17 component of the angular momentum calculated by assuming a deformation @xmath18 of a well deformed nucleus .",
    "the situation with few protons and neutrons occupying the @xmath5 shell is studied .",
    "the alignment of a pair of neutrons with the axis of rotation ( x ) , caused by the coriolis force , shows up as the step like rise of the angular momentum from small values to about 10 .",
    "it corresponds to the crossing of g- band with the neutron s - band , where the inflection point defines the crossing frequency .",
    "it is seen that the presence of the odd proton delays the alignment of the neutron pair . as demonstrated by fig .",
    "[ f : crossex ] both in the @xmath5 and in the @xmath3 shells a similar delay of the crossing frequency is seen for the combination ( @xmath19 ) . the estimated number of protons and neutrons in the high-@xmath2 shell , denoted by @xmath20 and @xmath21 , must be compared with @xmath22 and @xmath23 of the calculations , respectively .",
    "[ f : crossdef9 ] demonstrates that for near symmetric filling of the @xmath24 shell ( @xmath25 ) and ( @xmath26 ) the crossing frequency in the odd - a nuclei lies below the first crossing in the even - even nuclei ( @xmath27 ) , which corresponds to the simultaneous alignment of protons and neutrons @xcite .",
    "this inversion of the order of the bandcrossings seems to be seen in the br- and kr - isotopes , as illustrated by fig .",
    "[ f : crossex ] .",
    "the figure also shows that the inverse ordering for near symmetric filling as compared to asymmetric filling can be attributed to a delay of the crossing in the even even @xmath0 nuclei as compared to the ones with @xmath9 @xcite , which is stronger than the delay in the odd-@xmath22 system .",
    "the features discussed in the previous section reflect a systematic tendency that is illustrated in fig . [",
    "f : f72jx ] and [ f : f72momi ] , showing @xmath28 and @xmath29 for the @xmath30 shell .",
    "( we have chosen @xmath30 shell since the dimensions of the matrices to be diagonalized are lower and a systematic study is possible . )",
    "the alignments show up as peaks in @xmath31 .",
    "we are interested in the alignment of a pair of @xmath30 neutrons , which is displayed in lower panels of the figs . for the pure neutron @xmath32 and @xmath33 cases .",
    "if there were no p - n correlations , the frequency at which these alignments appear would not change with the number of protons .",
    "however , this is not seen .",
    "instead , the critical frequency for the neutron alignment first grows with the number of added protons .",
    "the shift reaches its maximum when @xmath34 and then decreases when @xmath22 becomes larger than @xmath23 .",
    "of course , the role of @xmath23 and @xmath22 could be exchanged .",
    "qualitatively , one may ascribe the progressive delay of the crossing to p - n correlations that disfavor the simultaneous alignment of protons and neutrons ( e. g. the presence of p - n pairs with a low @xmath8 ) , generated by the attractive p - n interaction .",
    "the more protons are added the stronger the correlations become , until @xmath34 .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the character of the p - n interaction between the aligned protons and neutrons changes from attractive to repulsive when @xmath22 exceeds @xmath23 , because the character of the aligned configuration changes from particle - like to hole - like .",
    "this shifts the p - n correlations to the highly excited states , whereas the yrast states are not much modified by the p - n interaction .",
    "the shift of the crossing frequency is a consequence of the @xmath35 part of the @xmath36-interaction . the dashed dotted line in fig .",
    "[ f : f72jx ] shows a calculation where the @xmath37 part of the @xmath36-interaction has been removed .",
    "the function @xmath28 almost coincides with the one calculated with the full force .",
    "the question if the p - n correlations that cause the shifts belong to the particle - hole channel or the particle - particle channel ( or to both ) can not be decided on the basis of the shell model calculations . for this , comparisons with mean field calculations are necessary , which will be addressed in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we state here only the existence of strong p - n correlations of the @xmath35 type between nucleons in the same @xmath2-shell , which cause a delay of the first bandcrossing .",
    "a delay of the onset of the bandcrossing for @xmath38 has recently been observed in the kr isotopes @xcite ( cf .",
    "[ f : crossex ] ) .",
    "it is suggested in the paper that the delay may be a consequence of @xmath37 pair correlations .",
    "as already mentioned , the dashed dotted line in fig .",
    "[ f : f72jx ] shows a calculation where we have switched off the @xmath37 part of the interaction .",
    "it is seen that the results are almost the same as for the full force , i.e. the @xmath37 correlations do not influence the alignment significantly in the present model analysis and it is interesting to see whether this conclusion will hold in a realistic study .    comparing in figs .",
    "[ f : f72jx ] and [ f : f72momi ] the alignment of the odd - proton in the @xmath39 system with the one in the @xmath40 one notices also the the alignment of an odd - proton is hindered by the presence of neutrons in the same @xmath2-shell .    in the previous work",
    "@xcite it was mentioned that strong p - n correlations can alter the bandcrossing substantially and the double - bandcrossing can occur below the individual proton and neutron crossings .",
    "however , most of the analysis was performed in the spherical approximation and the dominant component of the p - n interaction which changes the bandcrossing was not fully explored .",
    "it is shown in the present work using the proper deformed basis that it is @xmath35 component of the n - p interaction which is responsible for the particle number dependence of the bandcrossing .",
    "this is in accordance with a recent mean field study @xcite of the @xmath2-shell model system , which attributes the delay of the crossing frequency in the even - even @xmath0 system to the @xmath35 monopole pair field .",
    "it is clear from the present simple model study that the alignment of high-@xmath2 nucleons with the rotational axis is sensitive to the p - n interaction .",
    "the alignment of one kind of particles is delayed when the other kind of particles is present in the same @xmath2-shell .",
    "the effect reaches its maximum for @xmath0 and is a consequence of @xmath35 correlations between protons and neutrons . for @xmath34 the crossing frequency in the even system is higher than for asymmetric filling .",
    "the experimentally observed delay of the first backbend in @xmath34 even - even @xmath41kr can be attributed to these correlations .",
    "the experimentally observed delay of the first backbend in even - neutron nuclei by the presence of an odd - proton in the same @xmath2-shell could be a combination of these correlations and the change of deformation induced by the odd - nucleon . by measuring the deformation and/or calculating it one may try to disentangle the two effects and probe the p - n correlations .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that while the results of the present model analysis seem to point into the right direction they should not be compared with the experimental data in a quantitative form .",
    "it would be quite interesting to study the effects in more realistic shell model configuration spaces .",
