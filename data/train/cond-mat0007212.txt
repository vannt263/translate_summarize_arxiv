    "the interactions in the ising model or in the equivalent one - component lattice gas may then be understood to have arisen , or to have been altered , through the mediation of the particles occupying the decorated sites ( cells ) .",
    "in particular , the correlation functions between the particles occupying the primary cells , which would be those of the underlying ising model or one - component lattice gas , may be understood to have resulted from such mediation .",
    "this is then analogous to the circumstance in recent lattice models of hydrophobic interactions @xcite , in which the solvent - mediated potential of mean force between solute molecules is obtained in terms of the correlation functions of the pure solvent . in the present work",
    "the potentials of mean force between occupants of the primary cells in a class of decorated - lattice - gas models with closed - loop solubility curves @xcite are calculated and interpreted in terms similar to those in the lattice models of hydrophobic interaction @xcite .",

    "we start with a brief review of a version of _ mermin s decorated lattice model _ @xcite , fig .  1 , that describes a liquid mixture that possesses upper and lower critical solution points and a closed - loop temperature - concentration coexistence curve @xcite .",

    "the only interaction takes place between the molecules in adjacent primary - secondary cells .",
    "this interaction is defined to be 0 unless adjacent primary - secondary cells are occupied by molecules of different types , and its value then depends only on the orientation of the molecule in the secondary cell . for each primary - secondary neighboring",

    "this quantity is a measure of orientational ordering of the system .",
    "note that the orientations of molecules in primary cells do not enter the expression for the partition function and therefore are isotropic everywhere in the phase diagram .",
    "since every secondary - primary cell neighboring pair where the cells are occupied by opposite species and secondary cell occupants point to the primary cell comes with a factor @xmath28 , there is no need to introduce any auxiliary multipliers :    @xmath29    the structure of this expression is similar to that of ( [ ijk ] ) ; it gives the probability of finding a particular ordered primary - secondary - primary string multiplied by the average number of such strings .    to get the corresponding intensive quantity @xmath30",

    "similarly , the primary - secondary - cell correlation function @xmath75 is expressed through the following average : @xmath76 here @xmath5 and @xmath20 are the primary cells between which the secondary cell @xmath77 is situated .",
    "it follows that the primary - secondary cell correlation function of the decorated lattice model can be expressed through the energy - magnetization ( 3-point ) correlation function of the underlying ising model and various 2-point correlation functions .",
    "finally , for the primary - secondary cell potential of mean force @xmath78 , one obtains : @xmath79 .",
    "a similar approach shows that the secondary - secondary cell correlation function and potential of mean force for the decorated lattice model can be expressed through energy - energy ( 4-point ) , energy - magnetization ( 3-point ) and 2-point correlation functions .    because of the generic nature of mermin s decorated lattice model , these results are applicable for lattices in arbitrary dimension @xmath12 with various coordination numbers @xmath23",
    "using the formal mapping of the correlation functions of the decorated lattice model onto the correlation functions of an ising spin system , we perform computations of the 2- and 3- body potential of mean force in two dimensions .",

    "the dashed line marks the concentration @xmath84    despite the fact that the correlation functions for the ising model are available analytically in the form of series expansions ( see , for example , @xcite ) , we found it more convenient to generate them each time directly using monte carlo simulations .",
    "we used metropolis and wolff algorithms @xcite with the lattice size varying from @xmath85 to @xmath86 .",
    "all the results presented below were averaged over the whole system and over 200 configurations ; configuration were considered different if there were separated by about 10 flips for each spin in the wolff algorithm . the correlation functions and potentials of mean force",
    "were measured along the lattice ( `` normal '' ) unit vectors ( @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) and along the main diagonal @xmath89 .",
    "we found that in general the results for `` normal '' and `` diagonal '' measurements are very similar .",
    "an example is in figure 3 , where the two - body potential of mean force is shown .",
    "the dashed curve is a result of the superposition of normal and diagonal plots , with normal and diagonal points occurring at integer and @xmath90integer lattice separation .",
    "the potentials of mean force @xmath91 and @xmath92 were calculated for the temperatures corresponding to the widest point of the phase diagram ( @xmath93 , @xmath94 ) , and also for the two temperatures corresponding to the intersections of the dashed line and the coexistence curve in fig .  2 , at both of which there is the same minority species concentration @xmath95 ( @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) .",

    "for the three - body potential , we chose the two simplest configurations : in the first one , particles 1 , 2 , and 3 lie on a straight line with the distance @xmath102 between particles 1 and 2 being equal to the distance between particles 2 and 3 . in the second configuration particles 1 , 2 , and 3 form a right triangle in which the legs 1,2 and 1,3 are of equal length @xmath102 .",
    "we are mainly interested in the question of how well the effective 3-body interaction is approximated by the sum of the three pair interactions .    in fig .",
    "5 we present a plot of the difference between the sum of the three pair potentials and the true 3-body potential for a linear configuration , @xmath103 . since all potentials @xmath91 and @xmath92 are negative for any @xmath102 , one can observe that the sum of the three pair interactions clearly overestimates ( the absolute magnitude of ) the true 3-body potential .",
    "however , unlike in some one - dimensional models of hydrophobic interactions @xcite , this overestimate is less ( in absolute value ) than the interaction between the furthermost particles , 1 and 3 . to show that , a plot of the corresponding two - body potential @xmath104 is presented in the same fig .",
