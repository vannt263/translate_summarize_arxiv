    "quantum mechanics is famously plagued by certain conceptual problems , the resolution of which drive attempts to understand the theory .",
    "these attempts have resulted in the appearance of a diverse number of interpretations of quantum mechanics - ideas about how to relate mathematical objects from the theory to some picture of ( or viewpoint regarding ) physical reality .",
    "somewhat incredibly , there is still not even a consensus on precisely which features of quantum mechanics are the source of these conceptual problems .",
    "one approach that has been advocated is to simply deny the need for understanding quantum mechanics in terms of a metaphysical picture of reality at all .",
    "we will have nothing to say about such a dismissive approach in this paper .",
    "however , if , as will be assumed here , it is desirable to understand quantum mechanics in a realistic framework , then many possibilities arise .",
    "the simplest realistic approach is to simply assert that the quantum state itself is in one - to - one correspondence with reality .",
    "this , as einstein and others have emphasized @xcite , entails accepting a view of physical reality with arguably quite undesirable features ( e.g. violent nonlocality , discontinuous dynamics , ambiguous emergence of a classical ontology etc . ) .",
    "our goal in this paper is to lay out and expand upon a framework and a language in which ( almost ) any theory attempting to correlate quantum mechanics to a picture of reality can be formulated .",
    "this framework , first introduced in @xcite , includes the just - mentioned possibility that the quantum state _ is _ the state of reality .",
    "however , as emphasized in @xcite , it also includes possibilities wherein the quantum state is supplemented by some `` hidden variables '' . regardless of whether there are such hidden variables besides quantum states , it is possible that one might be able to interpret the quantum state _ epistemically _ @xcite - that is , in terms of probability distributions over some space ( see @xcite for explicit examples of such an epistemic construction ) . if a theory for the reality underpinning quantum mechanics can be formulated in the general terms we propose then we refer to it as an _",
    "ontological model_. following @xcite , the `` true states of reality '' posited by the model will be called `` ontic states '' .",
    "the terminology is chosen to emphasize that while such theories are not necessarily ` _ _ hidden _ _",
    "variable theories ' , they do attempt to formulate a picture of physical reality consistent with quantum mechanics .",
    "although one might not expect an ontological model to precisely follow the laws of classical mechanics , there are certain features , commonplace in classical physics , that one would hope could be retained - for instance , conservation laws and locality .",
    "amazingly , bell s theorem @xcite shows that locality must be abandoned in any theory whatsoever that describes our universe @xcite , including , of course , any ontological model .",
    "this feat of generality rested on bell s ability to abstract generic features possessed by all realistic models .",
    "consolidating and extending such generality is one goal of the ontological model formalism that we build upon . besides nonlocality",
    ", the other primary non - classical feature which any attempt at explaining quantum mechanics in a realistic framework must contend with is _",
    "contextuality_. contextuality , first considered for quantum mechanics by kochen and specker @xcite and then extended to deal with arbitrary theories by spekkens @xcite , is much less understood and appreciated than nonlocality .",
    "increasing the generality of the ontological model formalism also works towards a second goal of this paper ; to elucidate the precise manner in which contextuality must manifest itself in all such models .",
    "in addition to the above motivations , which originate from foundational considerations , a second series of motivations for this research stem from practical issues in the field of quantum information theory .",
    "precise formulations of a spectrum of realistic theories potentially underpinning quantum mechanics are of use to work in this field , regardless of their metaphysical consequences .",
    "such formulations allow us to probe and elucidate those features of quantum mechanics distinguishing it from classical realistic theories - the theories upon which all of classical information theory is predicated .",
    "while the role of quantum nonlocality ( and entanglement in particular ) in distinguishing quantum and classical information theory has been much speculated upon , contextuality has received far less attention in this regard @xcite .",
    "we believe this neglect to be a serious mistake .",
    "furthermore , aaronson @xcite has recently discussed how one can define complexity classes in terms of the increased computational power one might expect if one were able to access individual ontic states ( and obtain more information about a system than the quantum formalism itself allows ) .",
    "we show in sec .",
    "[ sec : example_aaronsonmodel ] how the theories considered by aaronson can be expressed in the ontological model formalism . in particular , it then becomes clear that not all ontological models yield the computational advantages that aaronson identifies .",
    "the paper begins in sec .",
    "[ sec : om_intro ] by presenting the ontological model formalism as it can be applied to quantum systems . in the next section a variety of ontological models , chosen to illustrate the breadth of possibilities ,",
    "are discussed .",
    "these models include the two famous examples from bell s papers @xcite , kochen and specker s non - contextual model of a qubit @xcite , aaronson s model @xcite , a model ( due to beltrametti and bugajski ) which takes the quantum state itself as real @xcite , and some interesting models of aerts @xcite .",
    "it will quickly become clear that the formalism of sec .",
    "[ sec : om_intro ] needs some augmentation , particularly if we want to be able to discuss the physical reality of preparation and measurement devices themselves ( as any posited realistic theory of the whole universe should ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ont_meas_prep ] we therefore undertake formulating such an extension , and find that several interesting new possible features arise which can distinguish different ontological models .",
    "we then turn to a deeper examination of how ontological models deal with the kochen - specker theorem . in doing",
    "so we identify a property we term _ deficiency _ , which all ontological models possess , and which forms the subject of sec .",
    "[ sec : deficiency_intro ] .",
    "deficiency involves the explicit breaking of the symmetry between preparations and measurements that is enjoyed by quantum mechanics ( e.g. that a preparation of a quantum state can be achieved by a projective measurement onto that state of a suitable system . )",
    "we also show how deficiency elucidates the fact that measurements in an ontological model must be disturbing .",
    "the formalism of quantum mechanics is well known and relatively unambiguous , but opinions are varied on just what this formalism is meant to describe , i.e. how it corresponds in some sense to reality .",
    "one of the most popular views is the operational one @xcite ; wherein the only concern of the theory is to reproduce outcomes of various experimental procedures employed by a scientist .",
    "the question of how quantum mechanics relates to reality is then taken to be outside the theories scope .",
    "this approach to quantum theory is one of two views that are commonly held ( often implicitly ) .",
    "the other frequently maintained position is that reality is _ completely _ described by the quantum state - so that within its domain of validity it is the end of the story .",
    "this is implicitly a realistic view , and therefore one that will be incorporated in the ontological model formalism . unless otherwise stated , when referring to quantum mechanics we will always have in mind an operational interpretation of the theory .",
    "if it is to be experimentally verified , any such operational theory needs to be able to describe the paradigm illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : prepmeas ] .",
    "a system @xmath2 , initially interacts with a preparation device @xmath3 which is configured according to some macroscopically determinable setting @xmath4 .",
    "this setting is manipulated in order to alter what the state of @xmath2 will be as it leaves @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath2 then travels towards a measurement device and @xmath5 . ] , @xmath5 , configured according to some setting @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath5 will then register some particular outcome dependent on both the state of @xmath2 and the setting @xmath6 .    ' paradigm for operational theories . ]",
    "we can ( for our purposes ) define operational quantum mechanics by how it determines measurement statistics within this kind of @xmath7 scenario ,    quantum mechanics is a theory that describes fig .",
    "[ fig : prepmeas ] by associating a density operator @xmath8 ( on a suitably chosen hilbert space @xmath9 ) with a preparation procedure @xmath4 , and a positive operator valued measure ( povm ) @xmath10 with the measurement procedure @xmath6 , there being one ` povm effect ' , @xmath11 for each of the possible measurement outcomes .",
    "the quantum prediction for the probability of the @xmath12 outcome in @xmath6 occurring conditioned on a preparation @xmath4 is then given by the born rule , @xmath13 .",
    "of course , special cases of this formalism are that quantum mechanics associates rays @xmath14 with pure state preparations and projection operators with sharp ( rank one ) measurements , which can be thought of as ` testing ' whether or not a system is in a particular pure state .    quantum mechanics , defined in this operational way ,",
    "is exceedingly successful at reproducing observed statistics , but it does nt give us any picture of what `` really '' goes on inside a system when experimental procedures are performed on it .",
    "in newtonian mechanics one deals with measurements , preparations and evolutions of a particle s position , and this position is posited to be ever - existing , simply revealed to us by measurement , so the theory is quite clear on how its predictions relate to reality . in comparison ,",
    "quantum mechanics deals with transformations of state vectors and no prior relation is specified between these state vectors and reality .",
    "a realistic view of quantum mechanics adds to this picture with the aim of providing a link between the quantum mechanical formalism and an underlying reality .",
    "there is of course no unique way in which one might achieve this kind of realistic interpretation , and in fact many such constructions have been given to date , the most famous surely being bohmian mechanics @xcite .",
    "in bohmian mechanics the quantum state of a particle and a specification of its position are taken to correspond directly to elements of the ` underlying reality ' .",
    "other attempts at realistic constructions can be found in @xcite we provide a more detailed consideration of a representative selection of these constructions ( and show how they can be expressed in the formalism we use ) in sec .",
    "[ sec : example_models ] .    to identify features common to these realistic constructions",
    "we would like a general language which allows us to abstract away the specific details of any one particular realistic view .",
    "we use the term ontological model to refer to a very natural , although non - exhaustive , formalism which does just this job . for the remainder of the paper",
    "we will implicitly restrict our attention to those realistic constructions expressible in this formalism .",
    "] , referring to them as _ ontological models _",
    "@xcite . so what will a general ontological model look like",
    "? any such model should pick up precisely where operational quantum mechanics leaves off , and specify just what it is that a quantum state allows us to infer about the real state of a system .",
    "the model can then be filled out by considering how each of the operations in fig .",
    "[ fig : prepmeas ] are taken to act on these hypothesized _ real states _ of the system .",
    "we would expect that acting a preparation procedure @xmath3 on a system @xmath2 would configure @xmath2 so that it possesses some particular real state after the preparation .",
    "a measurement procedure @xmath5 would then correspond to some kind of interaction with @xmath2 - an interaction tailored to be such that @xmath5 registers one or another measurement outcome dependent on the prior real state of @xmath2 .",
    "an ontological model quantifies these realistic notions , by introducing a set @xmath15 of _ ontic states _",
    "@xmath16 to be associated with @xmath2 .",
    "these constitute a complete description of whatever reality the model takes to underpin the system , so that a specification of @xmath16 is a complete description of any attributes that @xmath2 might possess .",
    "the precise form taken by @xmath15 will depend on the particular ontological model under consideration and the nature of the underlying reality that it introduces . in the simplest possible realistic interpretation",
    ", we can take quantum states to be direct and complete descriptions of reality .",
    "then we obtain an ontological model in which the ontic state space @xmath15 is precisely equal to the projective hilbert space of @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath17 .",
    "more generally however it might be the case that @xmath18 .",
    "then either the quantum state is not a complete description of reality and must be supplemented by extra ` hidden ' variables ( @xmath19 ) , or the quantum state does not play a realistic role at all ( @xmath20 ) , and must simply represent our _ state of knowledge _ of the real state of @xmath2 .",
    "for example , in bohmian mechanics , elements of @xmath15 consist of a specification of the system s quantum state _ and _ a specification of the system s position and therefore @xmath15 takes the form of a cartesian product @xmath21 .",
    "so the state space @xmath15 provides a description of the real state of the _ system _ , @xmath2 . preparation and measurement devices @xmath3 and @xmath5 ,",
    "ultimately being physical systems , should also be describable in terms of their own set of ontic states .",
    "however , the ontological model formalism has traditionally been restricted to a realistic description of @xmath2 alone , simplifying matters by treating @xmath3 and @xmath5 as external to the theory . in sec .",
    "[ sec : contextuality_interp ] we show how to extend the ontological model formalism to also provide ontological treatments for these devices , allowing us to consider a wider class of models and affording an insight into the manifestation of contextuality in realistic theories . for now , however , we will restrict our attention to the traditional formulation of providing a realistic description of the _ system _ only .    in this simplified picture (",
    "wherein we neglect ontological descriptions of @xmath3 and @xmath5 ) how does an ontological model quantify preparations and measurements in terms of operations on the real states of the _ system _ , @xmath2 ?",
    "in general , performing a preparation with setting @xmath4 will result in the system @xmath2 being prepared in some particular ontic state @xmath22 . simply knowing",
    "@xmath4 may , however , be insufficient information to deduce precisely which @xmath16 a system is in .",
    "thus , in general , an ontological model will associate a probability distribution @xmath23 over @xmath15 with preparation procedure @xmath4 .",
    "this distribution encodes our _ epistemological uncertainty _ as to the precise ontological configuration of @xmath2 , and so we refer to it as an _",
    "epistemic state_. note that since a system must be described by _",
    "@xmath22 we will require that ,    @xmath24    associating @xmath0 with a probability distribution is obviously compatible with the notion of quantum states having no direct relation to the ontic states , but it is also consistent with quantum states being taken to be precisely the ontic states themselves . to allow for this we need only take @xmath17 and write @xmath25 with @xmath26 being the dirac delta function and @xmath27 the unique ontic state associated with preparation settings consistent with @xmath0 .",
    "hence the view where quantum states are taken to be complete descriptions of reality can easily be expressed in the ontological model formalism . in the next section",
    "we will see an explicit example of a model that achieves this .",
    "consider now a measurement wherein @xmath5 is configured according to some setting @xmath6 .",
    "the outcome of this measurement will be determined by the ontic state @xmath16 of the system and how it interacts with @xmath5 ( a point which we elaborate on in sec .",
    "[ sec : contextuality_interp ] ) .",
    "now the most general possibility is that @xmath16 might only _ probabilistically _ determine a measurement outcome .",
    "following @xcite , we refer to models wherein even a complete description of reality only allows one to make probabilistic predictions , as being _ outcome indeterministic_. conversely if the ontic state @xmath16 of @xmath2 is sufficient to completely determine a measurement s outcome then we call the model _ outcome deterministic_. to allow for both these possibilities we therefore represent the @xmath12 outcome of a measurement performed according to @xmath6 by a distribution @xmath28 over @xmath15 , telling us the probability that a given @xmath22 will yield the @xmath12 outcome .",
    "we refer to such distributions as _ indicator functions _ ( considered as functions of @xmath16 ) . in outcome deterministic models , @xmath29 - so that the indicator functions are idempotent , i.e. we have @xmath30 for all @xmath16 . where might the probabilities appearing in outcome indeterministic models arise from",
    "? there are two possibilities .",
    "firstly they could occur because of our failure to take into account the precise ontological configurations of either @xmath3 or @xmath5 , a possibility which we address in sec .",
    "[ sec : contextuality_interp ] .",
    "alternatively it could be that the probabilities are an inherent property of the reality described by the model , so that even if one had complete knowledge of the configuration of the whole universe , one would be unable to make any certain statements about the system s future configuration .    since one or the other outcome of any measurement @xmath6 must occur - no matter what @xmath16 describes @xmath2 - we have , @xmath31 the settings @xmath4 and @xmath6 will play a crucial role in many of our discussions .",
    "clearly different settings @xmath4 can describe situations in which @xmath3 is set - within an operational quantum mechanical description - to prepare a system according to different density operators .",
    "similarly , different settings @xmath6 can describe cases where @xmath5 is set to implement different povm measurements . however , there are also many distinct settings of @xmath3 and @xmath5 consistent with a quantum mechanical description given by the _",
    "same _ density operator or povm .",
    "the settings will then specify different instances of some other extraneous property of @xmath3 or @xmath5 .",
    "we will later see that there exist quantitative extraneous properties which , although not altering the povm implemented , must alter the indicator function used by an ontological model . thus the quantum mechanical povm description of a measurement can actually be thought of as being a function @xmath32 of the measurement setting of @xmath5 - in that each povm corresponds in general to a certain _ set _ of settings of @xmath5 .",
    "hence although specifying @xmath6 will uniquely fix a povm @xmath33 , knowledge of only @xmath33 may be insufficient to completely determine @xmath6 .",
    "the full setting , @xmath6 , of @xmath5 is referred to as the _ measurement context _ ( a term we define in more detail later ) .",
    "hence , fully specifying the measurement context may require stating not just a povm @xmath33 , but also some ` extra ' information which completely determines @xmath5 s setting as defining a measurement setting .",
    "strictly speaking of course , we mean to say `` a measurement setting that is described _ in quantum mechanics _ by a povm @xmath33 '' . ] .",
    "so although we may occasionally write @xmath34 , we should really make explicit the precise setting @xmath6 by writing either @xmath35 or ( if we still want to make clear the povm ) , @xmath36 .",
    "similarly , a density operator @xmath37 may be compatible with many preparation settings @xmath4 , and so although we will often write epistemic states as @xmath38 , we should really express them in the form @xmath39 or @xmath40 .",
    "to summarize then , for the purposes of this paper , we can define an ontological model by the following criteria ,    an ontological model posits an ontic state space @xmath41 the probability of the ontic state being @xmath16 , given the preparation procedure @xmath4 is denoted by a probability distribution which we refer to as an _ epistemic state _ , @xmath42 .",
    "the probability of measurement outcome @xmath43 occurring given that the ontic state is @xmath16 and the measurement procedure was @xmath6 is given by an indicator function , written @xmath35 ( with @xmath30 in outcome deterministic models ) .",
    "we then demand that a successful ontological model of quantum mechanics should reproduce the required statistics by satisfying , @xmath44    seen from the viewpoint of an ontological model , a quantum mechanical picture of reality generally corresponds to a coarse - graining over the ontic states . by explicit construction",
    ", all ontological models will yield the same statistical predictions at this coarse - grained ` quantum level ' . in many models ,",
    "complete knowledge of the ontic configuration of a system would lead one to make predictions differing in some way from those of quantum theory .",
    "serious advocates of ontological models might claim that the reason we do not see these deviations from quantum predictions is because our current experiments are still too ` coarse - grained ' to be able to operate on the level of individual ontic states .",
    "another possibility , is that ontological models might inherently exhibit a restriction such that maximal possible knowledge of a system s ontological configuration is always _ incomplete _ knowledge @xcite .",
    "the ontic states describing a system would then , to some extent , be ` inherently unknowable ' .",
    "although such a restriction - of - knowledge principle has been shown to have the potential to reproduce many characteristic features of quantum mechanics @xcite , it is not a _ necessary _ feature of all ontological models .",
    "even though manipulation of individual ontic states is potentially forbidden ( either technologically or inherently ) , we will still have occasion to consider the predictions that a model would be able to make if we hypothetically were somehow able to prepare and distinguish between individual ontic states .",
    "in particular we will find it useful to refer to a kind of equivalence between models , which we define as follows ,    an ontological model @xmath45 is said to be * ontologically equivalent * to a second model @xmath46 if all statistics predicted by @xmath46 are exactly reproduced by model @xmath45 , even in cases where one is able to perform preparation and measurement procedures that distinguish between individual ontic states . [ def : ont_equiv ]",
    "the formalism that we have described so far is sufficient to describe many existing ontological models . however , there exist models which lie outside of its scope because of the way that they treat the measurement apparatus . in this section",
    "we present some examples of ontological models that show both the utility and limitations of the standard ontological model formalism .",
    "the limitations we encounter will act as motivations to generalize the formalism , a task we undertake in sec .",
    "[ sec : ont_meas_prep ] .",
    "the model of beltrametti and bugajski @xcite is essentially a thorough rendering of what most would refer to as an orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics .",
    "the ontic state space postulated by the model is precisely the projective hilbert space , @xmath17 , so that a system prepared in a quantum state @xmath47 is associated with a sharp probability distribution over @xmath15 , @xmath48 where we are using @xmath47 interchangeably to label the hilbert space vector and to denote the ray spanned by this vector .",
    "@xmath27 denotes the unique ontic state associated with the quantum state @xmath47 .",
    "thus the model posits that the different possible states of reality are simply the different possible quantum states .",
    "quantum statistics are reproduced by assuming that the probability of obtaining an outcome @xmath43 of a measurement procedure @xmath6 depends indeterministically on the system s ontic state @xmath16 as , @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the quantum state associated with @xmath22 , and where @xmath51 is the povm that quantum mechanics associates with @xmath6 .",
    "it follows that , @xmath52 and so the quantum statistics are trivially reproduced .",
    "if we restrict consideration to a system with a two dimensional hilbert space then @xmath15 is isomorphic to the bloch sphere , so that the ontic states are parameterized by bloch vectors of unit length , which we denote by @xmath53  the bloch vector associated with the hilbert space ray @xmath47 is denoted @xmath54 and is defined by @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the vector of pauli matrices and @xmath57 denotes the identity operator .",

    "( [ bb1 ] ) then simplifies to , @xmath60 where for brevity , we denote the indicator function @xmath61 associated with a projector @xmath62 as @xmath63 .",

    "aaronson then went on to consider the computational complexity of simulating models from this class .",

    "the outcome that would occur in a measurement of basis @xmath84 can then be inferred from the outcome in basis @xmath85 by the association that @xmath81 makes between elements of @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",

    "a specification of the preferred basis states from @xmath85 must be supplemented by specifying the system s quantum state .",

    "the epistemic states of aaronson s models take the form , @xmath89    that @xmath0 must also play an ontological role becomes clear from the indicator functions implied by aaronson s models .",
    "these are determined by the elements of the model s stochastic matrices .",
    "for example , suppose that one wishes to perform a measurement in a basis @xmath84 on a system in state @xmath0 .",
    "then , recalling aaronson s construction , we should rotate @xmath0 with the unitary @xmath90 .",
    "the probability of obtaining an outcome @xmath91 given that the initial ontic state from @xmath85 was @xmath92 is simply given by the @xmath93 element of the stochastic matrix @xmath94 ( where we use the subscript @xmath95 to denote the basis state from @xmath85 which leads us to infer an outcome @xmath91 ) . hence the indicator function associated with outcome @xmath91 ( i.e. with the projector @xmath96 ) is given by , @xmath97    note that because we must implement a rotation @xmath81 in order to perform our measurement in the preferred basis , and because the stochastic matrix associated with such a rotation necessarily depends on the quantum state @xmath98 , then the indicator function is also dependent on the system s state as well as the basis state from @xmath85 .",
    "thus we see that the most complete description that the model can give of measurement outcomes requires specifying the system s quantum state , not just the particular @xmath99 .",
    "therefore the quantum state itself must play an ontological role need not take an ontological role , but since it defines an epistemic distribution over the preferred basis @xmath85 , then perhaps it only introduces an epistemic component to the indicator functions , thus changing their statistics without playing an ontic role .",
    "however , this is not possible as one can simply see by noting that the _ amplitudes _ of a state in some fixed basis are not sufficient to completely parameterize its position in hilbert space , and so this kind of epistemic dependence of @xmath100 on @xmath0 would not confer enough information about @xmath0 to allow @xmath100 to fully reproduce the quantum statistics . ] .",
    "these choices for epistemic states and indicator functions reproduce the quantum statistics as required , @xmath101 where in the last line we have used the constraint on @xmath80 given in ( [ aaronson_qmstat ] ) and the fact that @xmath90 .",

    "clearly , access to ontic states from the beltrametti - bugajski model will not increase one s computational power beyond that possible with standard quantum mechanics .",

    "the model he introduced is outcome deterministic and valid for quantum systems described by hilbert spaces of any dimensionality .",
    "the ontic states @xmath15 of bell s first model can be written as the cartesian product of two subspaces , @xmath103 .",

    "as it stands , bell s second model can be comfortably expressed in the standard ontological model formalism .",
    "however , a slightly modified version of this simple model shows the limitation of the traditional formalism . in the above model the probabilistic nature of the quantum statistics derives from an uncertainty in the preparation of a system s ontic state ( as can be seen from eq .",

    "but it is also possible to reformulate the model so as to move this epistemic uncertainty into a lack of knowledge of how the _ measuring device _ is configured .",
    "such a possibility can not be conceived of within the traditional ontological model formalism , which only postulates ontic states for the system .",
    "clearly one needs to extend the formalism to include new ontic states @xmath149 from a new ontic state space @xmath150 that act as a complete physical description of @xmath5 .",
    "we will show in sec .",
    "[ sec : ont_meas_prep ] how one can introduce such an extension whilst still reproducing quantum mechanical predictions .",
    "it is also worth noting that , as in aaronson s models , the measurement devices in both of bell s models exhibit a dependence on the preparation device s setting , but a dependence that is mediated through the system s ontic state .",
    "our final example model is the strongest motivation for the extension we outline in the next section .",
    "aerts has studied ontological models which are entirely incompatible with the standard ontological model formalism , since they explicitly treat the measurement device at an ontological level .",
    "we will consider the model given by aerts in @xcite for spin-@xmath102 quantum systems .",
    "this model attempts to reproduce the quantum statistics through a rule for distributing small spheres of charge on a unit sphere .",
    "the preparation of a system @xmath2 having spin along a direction @xmath151 is represented in the model by the placement of a small sphere carrying a fixed positive charge @xmath152 at point @xmath151 on the unit sphere .",
    "the charge @xmath152 is in fact arbitrary , and therefore a complete description of @xmath2 is given by @xmath151 alone .",
    "thus the ontic state space @xmath15 of the system is isomorphic to the set of points on the surface of the unit sphere and we can write the ontic state pertaining to @xmath2 as @xmath64 .",
    "if the preparation device @xmath3 prepares a pure quantum state with bloch vector @xmath54 , then the epistemic state describing @xmath2 will be , @xmath153    a measurement of the system s spin along an arbitrary direction @xmath141 is represented by placing another two small spheres at positions @xmath154 , joined by a straight rigid rod passing through the origin .",

    "if the charge @xmath152 ends up moving towards the sphere at position @xmath141 then an outcome of spin - up along @xmath141 is declared .",

    "now note that there is no epistemic uncertainty in the ontological configuration of the _ system _ @xmath2 ; if one knows @xmath4 then one also knows the ontic state ( see ( [ aerts_epistemic ] ) ) . therefore ,",
    "as in the beltrametti - bugajski model , the model must implement indeterministic indicator functions over @xmath15 that directly mimic the quantum statistics that one expects when measuring the spin along @xmath141 of a system prepared according to @xmath54 ,    @xmath160    where @xmath161 is the angle between the vectors @xmath70 and @xmath141 .",

    "the beltrametti - bugajski model does not specify the nature of the indeterminism appearing in its indicator functions .",

    "it is clear from the description we have already given that aerts model provides more structure to the operation of @xmath5 , structure that we need in order to be able to distinguish it from the beltrametti - bugajski model . to quantify this structure",
    "we will need to create the extension of the ontological model formalism that we also found lacking in our discussion of the bell model .",

    "[ sec : ont_meas_prep ] we will return to aerts model in detail , distinguishing between two different possible manifestations of outcome determinism which we term micro and macro - determinism ( originally alluded to in sec .  [ sec : om_intro ] ) .",
    "our discussion so far has been greatly simplified by considering preparation and measurement devices as external objects not thoroughly treated by the theory , much as in an operational view of quantum mechanics .",
    "this approach of only associating an ontic state space @xmath15 with the system @xmath2 , has been the traditional approach for discussing ontological models .",
    "let us now suppose that we provide @xmath3 and @xmath5 ( which , after all , are also physical systems ) with the same ontological treatment as @xmath2 , by introducing two new sets of ontic states , @xmath162 and @xmath163 . the ontic states from these sets describe the complete configurations of @xmath3 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "recall that the settings @xmath4 and @xmath6 denote configurations of the devices when they are set to perform certain preparation or measurement procedures .",
    "there are many different ontological configurations of @xmath5 that we could imagine being consistent with it still performing the same measurement and thus being set according to the same @xmath6 .",
    "for example , if we simply changed the color of the paint on @xmath5 then its ontological configuration - being its _ complete _ description - would change , but of course the measurement it performs , and thus the setting @xmath6 describing it , would not be expected to change",
    ". therefore we can think of settings of @xmath3 and @xmath5 as defining subsets of their ontic state spaces .",
    "we denote the equivalence classes of ontic states consistent with settings @xmath4 and @xmath6 ( possibly implemented according to some context and [ def : prepcontext ] that we shortly give for preparation and measurement contexts show that , strictly speaking , _ any _ change of the ontic configuration @xmath149 of @xmath5 corresponds to a change of measurement context .",
    "thus even apparently trivial changes , such as the color of the paint on @xmath5 , actually constitute different measurement contexts",
    ". however , we will be interested in changes of @xmath5 s configuration that allow one to prove measurement contextuality , and in general such contexts will correspond to macroscopic alterations of @xmath5 s state . generally then , a measurement context will define a subset of ontic states contained within the set @xmath164 associated with a given setting @xmath6 . ] ) by @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "one thing worth noting about this idea of ` setting subsets ' is that subsets corresponding to different settings of either @xmath3 or @xmath5 will necessarily be disjoint ; @xmath167 and @xmath168 for @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "this should be true since knowledge of the ontic state of a device ( being a complete specification of its realistic description ) allows us to completely and _ uniquely _ infer the device s setting .",
    "how do preparation and measurement procedures on a system @xmath2 appear in terms of @xmath171 and @xmath150 ? performing a measurement on @xmath2",
    "involves an interaction between the ontic states of @xmath2 and @xmath5 , an interaction ultimately allowing an observer to infer pre - measurement information about the ontic state of @xmath2 from some macroscopic property of @xmath5 .",
    "similarly , a preparation of @xmath2 corresponds to an interaction between ontological configurations of @xmath2 and @xmath3 . clearly then , the occurrence of measurement and preparation procedures in an ontological model are crucially dependent on how the model relates @xmath172 , @xmath15 and @xmath173 . in order to be clear about what assumptions we make about such relations we will begin with a very general picture - one in which the three ontic state spaces do not even individually exist - and gradually refine it by applying appropriate assumptions on how they can interact .",
    "eventually we arrive at a formalism in which the ontological role of @xmath5 ( and @xmath3 ) within the standard formalism from sec .",
    "[ sec : om_intro ] is clear .",
    "the most general possible description of @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath5 is one in which the three systems are represented by a single non - separable reality , so that we can not even talk about individual systems @xmath3 , @xmath2 , @xmath5 or their individual ontic state spaces .",
    "then the best we can do is to speak of a single ` global ' ontic state space @xmath174 , containing ontic states @xmath175 which describe a configuration of the whole @xmath176 scenario .",
    "we then have epistemic states @xmath177 encoding the probability of preparing a particular @xmath178 given some settings @xmath4 and @xmath6 of @xmath3 and @xmath5 .",

    "the statistical predictions of such a model are given by ; @xmath180    note that we do not write @xmath179 as depending on @xmath6 since here we are allowing for the more general case , where the indicator function not only depends on the _ set _ of ontic states defined by a setting @xmath6 , but potentially on _ individual _ ontic states themselves - albeit non - separable ones , @xmath175 .",
    "in such non - separable models it is hard to build any intuitive picture of reality whatsoever , with even the concepts of system , preparation and measurement devices making little sense .",
    "consequently , all existing models assume a _",
    "separable _ picture of reality for @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath5 .",
    "this amounts to the assumption that the ` global ' ontic state space of the three systems can be written as a cartesian product of ontic state spaces for each individual system , @xmath181 , so that @xmath182 .",
    "models employing this assumption are constrained to reproduce quantum statistics according to , @xmath183    where we adopt the shorthand @xmath184 .",
    "the model thus now employs epistemic states @xmath185 and indicator functions @xmath186 which treat @xmath3 , @xmath2 and @xmath5 as having separate ontic states .",
    "thus we have arrived at a formalism incorporating models in which indicator functions are dependent on the settings of both the _ preparation _ and measurement devices .",
    "this formalism allows for cases where , unlike bell s second model and those considered by aaronson , a dependence on @xmath4 is not simply mediated through the ontic states of @xmath2 .",
    "in fact eq .  ( [ seperable ] ) can describe cases of even greater generality , wherein measurement outcomes are dependent on individual ontic states of @xmath3 and @xmath5 , not just the _ sets _ of ontic states defined by their settings .",
    "( [ seperable ] ) employs single joint distributions over the ontic states from all three systems , implicitly allowing for the possibility that there is a _ statistical _ dependence between the ontic states of each system .",
    "there are a few reasonable assumptions that we can make about the statistical relations that might exist between the systems .",
    "the validity of these assumptions can ultimately be called into question , but in fact our motivation for using the formalism is precisely so that we can study the ways in which such assumptions may _ fail _ to do justice to our universe .",
    "the hope is that we can pinpoint precisely which assumptions are the troublemakers .    in most models ,",
    "the configuration of a preparation device is taken to only indirectly affect the outcome of any measurement via its influence on the system @xmath2 . our second assumption ( after separability ) , is therefore a statistical independence between @xmath5 and @xmath3 .",
    "then not only are the ontic configurations of the two devices independent of each other , but furthermore the outcome of a measurement exhibits no _",
    "direct _ statistical dependence on the preparation device s ontic state - any such dependence having to be mediated through @xmath2 . under this assumption ,",
    "( [ seperable ] ) becomes , @xmath187    where in the second line we have marginalized over the dependence on the @xmath188 , which ( given our most recent assumption ) only appeared within the epistemic state @xmath185 .",

    "the epistemic states and indicator functions of aerts model are as given in ( [ aerts_epistemic ] ) and ( [ aerts_indicator ] ) . the key difference between the model of beltrametti - bugajski and that of aerts lies in the way that aerts model treats the measurement device , since it introduces an ontic state space for @xmath5 .",
    "the ontological configuration of @xmath5 consists of a specification of the arrangement of negatively charged spheres constituting the device . to completely specify this arrangement requires stating the orientation of the rod holding the spheres and the value of @xmath157 $ ] determining the charge held by the spheres .",

    "knowledge of @xmath158 is crucial in order to determine a measurement outcome , and upon marginalizing @xmath235 over @xmath225 we obtain an _",
    "indeterministic _ indicator function .",
    "thus we see a mechanism by which a determinism - apparently inherent as seen from the traditional ontological model formalism - can actually arise from an _ epistemic _ uncertainty regarding the precise configuration of a measurement device .",
    "this possibility has been investigated in rigorous mathematical detail by coecke @xcite .",
    "so far we have developed a way of describing reality according to ontological models , but that does little to tell us what _ kind _ of reality any particular ontological model might describe .",
    "this information is expressed by the structure of its ontic state space , @xmath15 . remarkably , there exist arguments constraining the structure of _ any _ realistic interpretation of quantum mechanics ( including ontological models ) to possess certain properties , such as nonlocality ( bell s theorem @xcite ) and contextuality ( the kochen specker theorem @xcite ) . as described in the introduction ,",
    "a key motivation for studying ontological models is to identify such properties .",
    "thus a pertinent question is how known properties are manifested within the ontological model formalism , a question which we address in this section for the case of contextuality .",
    "contextuality has been the subject of much debate ( see @xcite and @xcite for contrasting views ) and @xmath236 years after its inception it is still not clear what its necessity can teach us about realism in quantum mechanics . after reviewing the idea of contextuality we will use our extension to the ontological model formalism ( from sec .",
    "[ sec : ont_meas_prep ] ) to show how it is specifically manifested within these models .",
    "we are led to conclude that contextuality , as it stands , can be implemented as a very intuitive and unsurprising dynamical constraint .",
    "but the effect of contextuality on ontological models can be more subtle , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : deficiency_intro ] we will show how it implies a property which we call deficiency . as we discuss in sec .  [",
    "sec : deficiency_interp ] , deficiency prevents a natural relationship between preparations and measurements in quantum mechanics from being carried over to ontological models .",
    "we consider this to be one case in which contextuality can quantitatively be seen to give rise to unexpected behavior .",
    "contextuality has a long history , beginning in 1967 , when kochen and specker ( ks ) @xcite first introduced a notion which , following @xcite , we refer to as _ _ traditional contextuality _ _ and [ def : prep_contextuality_om ] ( originally introduced in @xcite ) . ]",
    "consider performing a projective measurement @xmath1 on a system .",
    "in a two dimensional hilbert space such a projector can be uniquely implemented by a measurement procedure with outcomes corresponding to @xmath0 and @xmath237 ( where @xmath238 ) . however , in a hilbert space with dimension greater than two , there is no unique way to physically implement such a projector onto a single quantum state @xmath0 . in an @xmath114 dimensional hilbert space ( @xmath239 ) one implements @xmath1 as part of an @xmath114 outcome pvm , where each outcome corresponds to one of @xmath114 orthogonal basis states .",
    "since there are a continuum of @xmath114 dimensional bases containing the vector @xmath0 , there exist a continuum of pvm measurements that can realize the projector @xmath1 .",
    "ks refer to the different pvms that contain a given rank one projector @xmath1 as the _ contexts _ of that projector .    in any outcome _ deterministic _ and realistic view of nature ( regardless of whether or not it can be formalized in terms of an ontological model ) , a projector @xmath115 is at all times assigned a definite outcome ` value ' , @xmath240 , even before it is measured .",
    "ks considered the possibility that a realistic outcome deterministic theory might have to ` change its mind ' about whether a value @xmath226 or @xmath227 is associated with a projector @xmath115 dependent on which pvm is used to implement it .",
    "such a dependence is what we refer to as _ traditional contextuality _ ;    an outcome deterministic ontological model is said to be * traditionally contextual * ( tc ) if there exists at least one projection operator , @xmath115 , such that the pre - determined outcome @xmath241 associated with @xmath115 is dependent on which pvm is used to implement it .",
    "[ def : moc ]    tc therefore tells us that specifying that a measurement device is configured to measure a projector @xmath115 is not sufficient in order to uniquely identify the ` real ' value assigned to the result of its measurement .",
    "rather we must specify the whole pvm that we would set @xmath5 to measure .",
    "incredibly , ks managed to show that tc , so defined , must be possessed by all outcome deterministic realistic theories reproducing the ( experimentally verified ) predictions of quantum mechanics .",
    "we reproduce their ingenious proof in appendix [ app : ks ] , translated into the language of the ontological model formalism .",
    "in one sense , ks s proof of tc is extremely general .",
    "associating a pre - existing value @xmath241 to a projector @xmath115 is a requirement of any realistic outcome _ deterministic _ theory and therefore tc is defined ( and proven by ks to be necessary ) for _ any _ such theory , not only those that can be expressed in the ontological model formalism .",
    "there are however , a few shortcomings of tc . definition",
    "[ def : moc ] only applies to systems described in quantum mechanics by a hilbert space of dimension greater than or equal to @xmath242 .",
    "furthermore , it applies only to outcome _",
    "realistic theories .",
    "yet as was emphasized by bell @xcite and discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : om_intro ] , an assumption of outcome determinism is quite distinct from one of realism .",
    "another shortcoming of tc is that changing the pvm implementing a projector is not the only change of @xmath5 s setting that quantum mechanics predicts should leave measurement outcome statistics unaltered .",
    "for example there are many different ways of convexly decomposing elements of a given povm measurement can be convexly decomposed in terms of a set of other povms @xmath243 , if each of its effects can be written in the form @xmath244 with @xmath245 forming a valid probability distribution . ] , each of which provides a different experimental arrangement in which one could physically measure the same povm elements .",
    "thus there are several reasons why tc appears a somewhat restricted notion of contextuality , and one is led to wonder whether it is possible to generalize the idea .",
    "such a generalization was provided by spekkens in @xcite . to begin with",
    ", one can broaden the definition of a measurement context @xcite ,    the possible * contexts * of the outcome of a measurement performed by device @xmath5 are all those measurement settings @xmath6 which do not alter the frequency of the outcome when the measurement is performed on any particular preparation of a system @xmath2 .",
    "[ def : context ]    different measurement procedures in quantum theory will give the same outcome statistics so long as they are all described by the same povm element .",
    "_ any _ different settings @xmath6 resulting in an outcome being described in quantum mechanics by the same povm ( although perhaps written in another form ) are therefore , according to our above definition , different _ contexts _ of that outcome .",
    "we have already mentioned measurement contexts associated with different pvms realizing a given projector , and different convex decompositions of a povm . by definition [ def :",
    "context ] there are clearly innumerable other possible contexts .",
    "the macroscopic nature of @xmath5 ensures that there are a multitude of degrees of freedom one can manipulate whilst effectively leaving the measurement operation of the device un - altered .",
    "of course many of these contexts would be hard to formally quantify , and we restrict our consideration to those contexts that can be described in a meaningful manner .",
    "we can use definition [ def : context ] to introduce a generalized notion of _ measurement contextuality _ for both outcome deterministic and _ _",
    "in__deterministic ontological models @xcite ,    an ontological model is said to be * measurement non - contextual * if it only associates a single indicator function @xmath34 with a given povm element @xmath11 , regardless of its context .",
    "conversely a model is said to be * measurement contextual * if the indicator function that it assigns to @xmath11 depends on its context , i.e. if there exist @xmath246 such that @xmath247 ( with @xmath6 and @xmath248 representing different measurement contexts of the povm effect @xmath11 ) .",
    "[ def : meas_contextuality_om ]    according to this new definition , measurement contextuality is a non - equivalence of a model s mathematical representations of those measurements which quantum mechanics treats as being operationally identical .",
    "as we noted previously , one can conceive of many different measurement contexts and an ontological model could potentially exhibit measurement contextuality with respect to any of them .",
    "therefore we must take care to specify with respect to which context we might consider measurement contextuality at any given time . as shown in @xcite , kochen and specker s tc",
    "is now seen to be a special case of this generalized measurement contextuality .",
    "specifically , tc corresponds to ` measurement contextuality with respect to the choice of pvm ' in models that exhibit outcome determinism for projective measurements .",
    "in fact , following @xcite , we can widen our concept of contextuality even further by adapting definition [ def : context ] to apply to _",
    "preparations_. we define a preparation context as follows ,    the possible * contexts of a preparation * performed by device @xmath3 are all those preparation settings @xmath4 of @xmath3 which prepare a system @xmath2 in states all yielding identical measurement statistics for any particular measurement performed on them .",
    "[ def : prepcontext ]    preparations that are described in quantum theory by the same density operator always yield the same measurement statistics",

    ", there are many ways one could vary @xmath4 without altering the density operator describing the measurement .",
    "for example , there are many different ways of convexly decomposing a mixed state density operator @xmath37 .",
    "each of these provide a distinctly different probabilistic preparation procedure realizing @xmath37 , but yet all result in the same statistical predictions for any measurement .",
    "thus different convex decompositions of a density operator form different contexts of a preparation .    definition [ def : prepcontext ] puts us in a position to consider the possibility of _ preparation contextuality _ within ontological models @xcite ,    an ontological model is said to be * preparation non - contextual * if it only associates a single epistemic state @xmath38 with a given density operator , @xmath37 , regardless of the preparation context .",

    "to see this , note that in the beltrametti - bugajski model a convex decomposition @xmath252 of a mixed state @xmath37 into a set of pure states corresponds to an epistemic state @xmath253 ( see lemma [ lem : mu_convex_relation ] in appendix [ app : elementary_results ] for a justification ) . clearly then",

    "as before , the hemispherical supports of these distributions are such that , @xmath276 and ,    @xmath277    thus @xmath278 , and we see that in some cases the ks model implements measurement contextuality by having an indicator function s _ support _ depend on the measurement context .",
    "having seen these examples , one might wonder to what extent ontological models _ must _ exhibit these generalized kinds of contextuality .",
    "in fact spekkens has shown in @xcite that any ontological model associating deterministic indicator functions with projective measurements must exhibit measurement contextuality with respect to different convex decompositions of a povm .",
    "furthermore , any model must exhibit preparation contextuality with respect to different convex decompositions of a density operator .",
    "thus the epistemic states and indicator functions that an ontological model associates with certain preparations and measurement outcomes must change dependent on the context that realizes them .",
    "it is worth noting that , although it was the case in the ks model , such a dependence does not necessarily require the _ supports _ of epistemic states or indicator functions to change .",
    "i.e. we may not necessarily have a change in _ which _ ontic states could have been prepared by a preparation or might produce a given measurement outcome .",
    "instead it could be that only the non - zero _ probability assignments _ are altered for some context - independent set of ontic states .",
    "the case is , however , more clear - cut within those ontological models that are outcome deterministic .",
    "then measurement contextuality requires that indicator functions _ must _ change their supports since deterministic indicator functions only assume values of @xmath226 or @xmath227 .",
    "any change in their assignments amounts to a change of support !",
    "although the kinds of measurement and preparation contextuality introduced in definitions [ def : meas_contextuality_om ] and [ def : prep_contextuality_om ] are the only kinds of contextuality typically considered , there is another interesting possibility . recall that acarinoses s indicator functions are dependent on the quantum state that a system is _ prepared _ in , and therefore are dependent on the preparation setting @xmath4 .",
    "these models thus introduce the possibility of a strange kind of contextuality in which the indicator function associated with a _ measurement _ is dependent on the setting used for a system s _ preparation_. in aaronson s model this kind of contextuality is somewhat trivial , since @xmath4 is in fact an ontic state , so it is entirely natural for the indicator functions to be dependent on the setting of @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , as was seen in sec .  [",
    "sec : ont_meas_prep ] , most models implicitly assume a lack of direct statistical dependence between @xmath3 and @xmath5 , so this strange contextuality will only ever apply to a small subset of ontological models .",
    "in definition [ def : moc ] we gave a mathematical definition of tc , and in definitions [ def : meas_contextuality_om ] and [ def : prep_contextuality_om ] we generalized the notion to preparation and measurement contextuality .",
    "but we still lack a clear picture of exactly what it is that these ideas of contextuality really mean in our ontological model formalism - what kind of structure might they enforce on the ontic state space @xmath15 and its dynamics ?",
    "understanding this is crucial for us to even begin to judge to what extent contextuality , like nonlocality , goes against our intuition and might fundamentally prohibit a realistic view of the quantum world .",

    "it is clear that , since the definition of this property relies crucially on assigning definite values to projective measurements , it can only make sense in outcome _",
    "deterministic _ ontological models .",
    "we therefore temporarily restrict ourselves to such cases .",
    "but even under a deterministic restriction our ontological model formalism does not explicitly talk about ` assigning outcomes ' to measurements , as definition [ def : moc ] does .",
    "rather our formalism employs indicator functions ; assigning outcomes dependent on the ontic state of @xmath2 . how then can we import tc into our formalism ?    there are two ways that tc can be manifested within an ontological model .",
    "consider a system @xmath2 , described in quantum mechanics by a three dimensional hilbert space .",
    "suppose that this system actually resides in an ontic state @xmath16 and that we use a device @xmath5 to perform a projective measurement @xmath279 on @xmath2 .",

    "hence _ in order for the outcome assigned to @xmath282 to be dependent on the pvm setting ( as required by tc ) , our model must ensure that the inclusion of @xmath16 in @xmath285 is dependent on this setting_. we explicitly derive this requirement in appendix [ app : ks ] , where we recreate the original ks argument for tc in the ontological model language ( associating a deterministic indicator function @xmath286 with a projective measurement @xmath115 , as opposed to a ` value assignment ' , @xmath241 ) .",
    "clearly there are two ways in which the inclusion of @xmath16 in @xmath287 could change ; either by changing @xmath287 or by changing @xmath16 .",

    "bell s first model however , being an outcome deterministic model for hilbert spaces having dimension greater than @xmath301 , is bound by the kochen specker theorem to exhibit tc .",
    "one might therefore speculate at the possibility of some kind of relationship between tc and deficiency .",
    "in fact we will shortly show that any model exhibiting contextuality for projective measurements ( of which tc is the only known quantified example ) must exhibit deficiency .",
    "first however , we must take a moment to define deficiency more rigorously . in the brief introduction",
    "presented above , we referred to there being a single epistemic state @xmath302 associated with a preparation @xmath0 , and a single indicator function @xmath303 associated with a projective measurement @xmath1 .",
    "the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : conextuality_intro ] showed that in some cases one can not get away with only associating a single indicator function with @xmath1 .",
    "rather , tc implies that to unambiguously specify an indicator function one will also need to specify the context of a measurement .",
    "it is also a possibility ( although it has not yet been proven to be a necessity ) that more than one epistemic state could be associated with a given _ pure _ state preparation @xmath0 , depending on the setting @xmath4 used to prepare it . thus referring to deficiency as meaning @xmath304 is somewhat ambiguous . with respect to which contexts",
    "do we need this expression to hold ?",
    "accordingly , we adopt a refined idea of deficiency .",
    "an ontological model will be said to _ not _ be deficient if @xmath305 for all @xmath306 , where @xmath4 , and @xmath6 denote full specifications of the device s settings , including their context .",
    "note that such an equality between supports is the only possibility in a non - deficient model , since we show in lemma [ lem : lemma_mu_lt_xi ] of appendix [ app : elementary_results ] that the epistemic states and indicator functions of any model must always satisfy @xmath307 .",
    "thus we rigorously classify ontological models as deficient by the following criteria ,    an ontological model is said to be * deficient * if there exists a pure quantum state @xmath0 for which we have , @xmath308 for * some particular * @xmath4 and @xmath6 .",
    "[ def : deficiency ]    in terms of the quantum formalism , deficiency states that the set of ontic states possibly describing a system prepared in a quantum state @xmath0 can not be the same as those ontic states triggering a positive outcome for a measurement @xmath1 .",
    "it is quite simple to show that tc implies deficiency , so that any proof of the necessity of tc in ontological models implies the necessity of deficiency as a simple corollary .",
    "any ontological model capable of describing systems of dimension greater than @xmath301 must be deficient in the sense of definition [ def : deficiency ] .",
    "[ thrm : deficiency ]    the proof of this theorem proceeds in two parts . we first present a simple argument showing that any outcome _",
    "ontological model must be deficient .",
    "following this we complete the proof by showing that deficiency must also apply to all outcome deterministic models , so long as tc holds .",
    "first then , consider outcome indeterministic models , and suppose for a reductio ad absurdum , that deficiency does _ not _ hold .",
    "then there would exist some quantum state preparation @xmath0 and associated projective measurement @xmath1 for which the model employs epistemic states and indicator functions satisfying , @xmath309 for all @xmath4 and @xmath6 .",
    "now since we expect that a system prepared in a state @xmath0 should _ always _ pass a projective measurement test @xmath1 then we require , @xmath310    however , since @xmath302 is a normalized probability distribution over @xmath15 ( see eq .",
    "( [ mu_norm ] ) ) then we can only satisfy ( [ psi_meas_psi ] ) by having @xmath311 for all @xmath312 .",
    "but if deficiency does not hold then this would also imply that @xmath311 for all @xmath313 - i.e. that @xmath303 is a _",
    "indicator function , contrary to our initial assumption .",
    "thus we conclude that if a model is outcome indeterministic then it must be deficient .",
    "now we turn to outcome deterministic ontological models . for another reductio ad absurdum",
    ", we again consider an ontological model that is not deficient , so that again ( [ no_deficiency ] ) holds .",
    "now fix a preparation setting @xmath4 .",
    "( [ no_deficiency ] ) then implies that we will have , @xmath314    and thus , @xmath315    for _ any _ two measurement settings @xmath169 .",
    "but recalling definition [ def : meas_contextuality_om ] , eq .",
    "( [ nodef_violatecontext ] ) has shown that , @xmath316    and so , @xmath317    but we know from the kochen specker argument ( reproduced in appendix [ app : ks ] ) that there exists some @xmath0 and some settings @xmath6 , @xmath248 for which tc can be proven to occur in any outcome deterministic ontological model of quantum mechanical systems having dimension greater than @xmath301 .",
    "thus we deduce from ( [ moc_imply_def ] ) that any such outcome deterministic ontological model must be deficient .",
    "we have trivially been able to show that any outcome indeterministic model must be deficient .",
    "but the possibility remains that outcome deterministic models of @xmath301 dimensional quantum systems may not be deficient .",
    "this is because theorem [ thrm : deficiency ] shows that deficiency results when deterministic indicator functions are dependent on the measurement setting @xmath6 .",
    "this occurs when a model exhibits tc , which it can not if it describes a two dimensional system . but deficiency can also follow if deterministic indicator functions are dependent on the _ preparation _ setting of a system , @xmath4 .",
    "as we noted in sections [ sec : example_aaronsonmodel ] and [ sec : example_bell2 ] , both aaronson s model and bell s second model - through their choice of ontic state space - exhibit a dependence of @xmath5 on @xmath4 , and indeed we can see that both these models are deficient . for example , in the case of bell s second model , @xmath318 ( where @xmath319 is the hemisphere of @xmath106 centered on @xmath54 ) , so that epistemic states are restricted to have their supports over only one element @xmath320 , determined by their preparation setting @xmath4 .",
    "the indicator functions however , due to their dependence on the system s quantum state ( i.e. @xmath4 ) , have the larger support @xmath321 , where we have written @xmath322 to make clear the implicit dependence of @xmath142 on @xmath143 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : example_bell2 ] ) .",
    "this support includes @xmath323 as the special case @xmath324 , since then @xmath325 .",
    "thus deficiency is achieved because of @xmath326 s dependence on @xmath107 , i.e. on @xmath4 .",
    "one might also be led to think of deficiency as an implication of tc ( since for outcome deterministic models it is the existence of tc that ensures deficiency ) .",
    "but we have also trivially managed to show that deficiency must exist in outcome indeterministic ontological models , for which tc can not possibly be exhibited .",
    "thus deficiency actually holds for a wider class of ontological models than tc .",
    "we have seen that for a large class of ontological models the set of ontic states possibly describing a system prepared in a quantum state @xmath0 can not be the same as those ontic states triggering a positive outcome for a measurement @xmath1 .",
    "but what implications does this deficiency have ?",
    "how would a deficient ontological model behave ?",
    "we now attempt , through an analogy , to describe the operational implications of deficiency , and show that it is in some sense a surprising property of ontological models .",
    "of course arguments like this that intend to address ` intuitiveness ' or ` surprisingness ' are highly subjective , but regardless of how it is read , the analogy we provide below nevertheless gives some picture of the behavior of deficient ontological models .",
    "crucial to our definition of deficiency is that we implicitly hold there to be an association between a quantum preparation @xmath0 and a quantum measurement @xmath1 , warranting a comparison of the associated epistemic states and indicator functions .",
    "this is of course motivated by the fact that @xmath1 is the unique rank one measurement for which the born rule yields an outcome probability of @xmath227 for a system prepared according to @xmath0 .",
    "understanding the role of this association in an ontological model is key to understanding deficiency . to this end , we digress into a simple analogy from classical physics .",
    "imagine a toy system consisting of a small ball @xmath327 , and suppose that a complete description of the ball is given by a specification of its position .",
    "the ball is a completely classical object , and so it will always have some definite position regardless of whether or not it is observed .",
    "suppose that the possible preparation and measurement procedures that one can perform on @xmath327 are defined by boxes fixed at definite positions in space .",
    "preparing @xmath327 ` according to a box @xmath328 ' implies that @xmath327 is known to reside at some definite but unknown position within @xmath328 immediately after the time of preparation .",
    "the boxes thus represent a restriction on our ability to know the exact position at which @xmath327 is placed during a preparation .",
    "similarly suppose that the measurements that we can perform on @xmath327 are restricted to being performed ` according to some box @xmath329 ' .",
    "by this we mean that the outcome of such a measurement would tell us only whether or not the ball resided within that box , but not its exact position .",
    "this ` box - world ' is in many ways analogous to our ontological model constructions .",
    "the position of @xmath327 - being a complete description of the ball system - is analogous to our system ontic states @xmath22 and the boxes @xmath328 and @xmath329 are representative of the _ supports _ of epistemic states and indicator functions over @xmath15 .",
    "now scientists living in box - world , perhaps through some perverse historical accident , have come to adopt a theory that they refer to as the ` box - o - centric ' theory .",
    "in this theory it is asserted that _ there is no ball _",
    "@xmath327 , and no concept of real positions at all - only the abstract concept of a box .",
    "such a theory , wherein we talk only about boxes , is very strange , since , although the concept of a box exists , there is no notion of ` being contained ' within a box , and furthermore ( since box - o - centrics do not find position to their taste ) no way in which to distinguish between boxes in terms of the positions at which they reside .",
    "we mentioned above how we associate a quantum preparation @xmath0 and projective measurement @xmath1 because of the probabilities obtained through the born rule .",
    "suppose that a box - o - centric scientist wanted to similarly try and associate box preparations and measurements .",
    "now a box - o - centric advocate is unable to compare the positions of two boxes as a reference for such associations , since she does not believe in such concepts .",
    "thus the only way a box - o - centric could identify a measurement as being a measurement _ of _ box @xmath330 would be in a way analogous to how we identify @xmath1 as a measurement of @xmath0 in quantum mechanics .",
    "that is , test whether that measurement always gives a positive outcome when performed on systems prepared according to box @xmath330 .",
    "a box satisfying this criterion would , as far as the scientist is concerned , be the best candidate box for performing a measurement of box @xmath330 .",
    "thus box - o - centrics are restricted to only compare boxes in an operational fashion .",
    "but box - o - centrics are not the only scientists in box - world , there are also box - realists , who heretically believe that positions exist . they propose that @xmath327 always resides somewhere , regardless of the fact that box - world scientists are somehow condemned to only ever possess incomplete information about its position .",
    "now these box - realists , who have no qualms with positions , would naturally hope that preparation and measurement boxes which had previously been identified with each other by box - o - centrics would _ actually _ be equal - i.e. enclose the same positions .",
    "then whenever a measurement of box @xmath330 had been performed , it really would have been telling us that @xmath327 had been prepared with a position inside the box @xmath330 .",
    "we can level a similar hope at quantum mechanics ; that upon introducing the idea of ontic states , a measurement @xmath1 will remain associated with a preparation @xmath0 . by this",
    "we mean that we would like the ontological description to be such that any system yielding a positive outcome for @xmath1 will have been described by an ontic state that a preparation @xmath0 could have left it in .",
    "i.e. we would hope that @xmath331 . since @xmath1 is the best measurement that quantum mechanics provides for testing whether a system is in a state @xmath0",
    ", our proof of deficiency shows that _ there is no quantum measurement that would allow us to deduce with certainty whether the * ontological configuration * of a system was compatible with a preparation @xmath0_. so deficiency tells us that the real description introduced by an ontological model can not , as we might have hoped , maintain the operational association we make between preparations and measurements in quantum mechanics .",
    "any such realistic theory must instead exhibit a more complicated structure .",
    "one can also use deficiency to restrict the dynamics an ontological model implements upon measurement . for every state , there are occasions when a measurement of the projector onto that state will necessarily induce a disturbance of a system s ontic state . to help show this ,",
    "denote , @xmath332 deficiency shows that there exist states @xmath47 such that @xmath333 .",
    "it will also be helpful to note that for any @xmath334 one can always find a state @xmath98 such that @xmath16 falls in the support of its epistemic state .",
    "furthermore , since its epistemic state has a finite overlap with @xmath335 , this state @xmath98 will neither be equal , nor orthogonal to @xmath0 .",
    "now the update rule that quantum mechanics specifies when obtaining an outcome @xmath336 of some pvm performed on a system in state @xmath337 is , @xmath338 one might expect that the analogous update rule in a deterministic ontological model would be , @xmath339 which essentially ` projects ' the system s epistemic state onto the support of @xmath303 .",
    "however , this non - disturbing update rule must fail in deficient ontological models because deficiency requires @xmath16 to be disturbed upon measurement , as we now show .",
    "suppose that we implement the preparation of a system in some quantum state by filtering the results of a measurement on the system .",
    "for example , assuming a von neumann collapse rule , a preparation of a system @xmath2 in state @xmath0 can be effected by performing a pvm measurement , @xmath340 , containing the rank one projector @xmath1 , on @xmath2 and then post - selecting only those systems that yield the outcome corresponding to @xmath1 . the systems that will survive this measure - and - filter procedure and be prepared in state @xmath0 are thus those yielding the outcome @xmath1 of @xmath340 .",
    "therefore any system described by an ontic state satisfying @xmath341 will successfully be prepared in state @xmath0 by this method .    now",
    "naturally , we require that the ontic state of any system said to be prepared in a state @xmath0 should satisfy @xmath342 .",
    "but as we noted previously , a system can be configured according to an ontic state @xmath334 , such that the measure - and - filter procedure will prepare it in state @xmath0 , but yet it does not satisfy the associated requirement @xmath342 .",
    "measurements in a deficient model must employ some kind of ontic state dynamics to rectify this inconsistency , and consequently eq .  ( [ updaterule_om ] ) can not correctly describe the measurement process in ontological models . whilst one can give much simpler proofs to show that realistic theories must provide such a disturbance on measurement , our derivation shows explicitly how disturbance can be related to the contextual nature of a theory .",
    "we have outlined how one can increase the scope of an existing formalism for realistic theories to include models that consider measurement procedures in more detail .",
    "an often debated topic is whether or not contextuality is a truly surprising requirement of ontological models . in sec .  [",
    "sec : contextuality_interp ] we have shown how our quantitative description of measurement devices allows contextuality ( to the extent that it is normally considered ) to be realized as a reasonable dynamical constraint on the interaction of a system and measurement device . however , as we stressed previously , this leaves open the possibility that these constraints might , under further investigation , take on a more pathological form . indeed , in sec .  [ sec : deficiency_intro ] we went some way in this direction by arguing that deficiency - the fact that one can not faithfully associate measurements with a given preparation - provides at least one aspect of contextuality which is manifestly not so reasonable . if nothing else , we see this as evidence that there is more to be said about contextuality , and that judgement of its implications should be reserved until one can quantitatively analyze its effects in more depth .    addressing problems from quantum information using a realistic approach to quantum mechanics can be a powerful tool , a fact highlighted by aaronson s work on complexity and hidden variables . using the ontological model formalism",
    ", we have characterized those models to which his results apply .",
    "another key motivation for our study of ontological models is to quantify the conceptual problems of quantum mechanics relative to a realistic framework .",
    "crucially , we see the utility of a realistic approach as being able to highlight these problems in a familiar language , regardless of whether the approach satisfactorily solves them . essentially , our motivation is to see what properties a realistic theory must possess in order to reproduce quantum mechanics . in this paper we have tried to build on this approach by going some way to quantitatively clarifying the status of contextuality and introducing the property of deficiency .",
    "much work remains to be done in order to fully understand the requirements of any realist theory reproducing quantum mechanics , but there has been evidence @xcite to show that this approach may indeed be a fruitful one .",

    "the argument that kochen and specker ( ks ) used @xcite to prove that any realistic theory must exhibit traditional contextuality ( tc ) involves a remarkable geometric construction which we now outline .",
    "ks did not derive their proof using the formalism we introduced in sec .  [",
    "sec : om_intro ] , but instead worked in a simpler ( yet more restrictive ) formalism wherein they simply consider assigning a definite outcome value @xmath343 to any projective measurement @xmath115 .",
    "we now review their proof within our ontological model approach , allowing us to directly see traditional contextuality s repercussions for these theories .",
    "the argument begins by considering a specific set , @xmath344 , of @xmath345 states pertaining to a quantum system @xmath2 described by a three dimensional hilbert space .",

    "the spectacular resulting graph , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ksgraph ] , can be considered an ` orthogonality map ' of the set @xmath346 .",
    "the elements of @xmath346 are taken to define a set of @xmath345 projective measurements that one could performed on a @xmath242 dimensional quantum system , @xmath347 .",
    "an element @xmath348 represents a test for whether a system is in the state @xmath349 .",
    "an outcome deterministic ontological model introduces a set of @xmath345 indicator functions @xmath350 , which are distributions over the ontic state space of @xmath2 .",
    "these are taken to be in one - to - one correspondence with the set @xmath340 of projectors .",
    "we restrict our attention , as ks did in their original argument , to outcome deterministic ontological models can be applied to outcome indeterministic models . ] .",
    "therefore , when evaluated at some fixed , but otherwise arbitrary ontic state @xmath351 , each element of @xmath352 will specify an assignment of either @xmath226 or @xmath227 to its corresponding projector from @xmath340 .",
    "equivalently , we can think of each element of @xmath352 as specifying , for each @xmath351 , an assignment of @xmath226 or @xmath227 to each vertex in fig .",
    "[ fig : ksgraph ] .",
    "the task at hand for an ontological model is to perform these binary assignments to graph vertices in a way consistent with the predictions of quantum theory .",

    "[ fig : ksgraph ] as either _ red _ ( for an assignment of value @xmath226 ) or _ green _ ( for an assignment of value @xmath227 ) . the task faced by an ontological model is then to color the vertices of fig .",
    "[ fig : ksgraph ] in a way consistent with quantum mechanics .",
    "but just what are the restrictions that quantum theory imposes on such a coloring ?",
    "having defined their coloring scheme , ks derive a set of three _ coloring constraints _ , which are imposed on any coloring of fig .",

    "any two connected vertices must be colored so that both of them are not green .",

    "thus each triad defines a pvm measurement on @xmath2",
    ". lemmas [ lem : xi_pvm_span_lambda ] and [ lem : xi_pvm_disjoint ] together imply that one and only one of the triad of ( assumed indeterministic ) indicator functions associated with a pvm can assign a value of @xmath227 for any given @xmath22 .",

    "[ fig : ksgraph ] which belong to more than one triad , and the geometrical part of the ks argument implicitly needs to assume that one does not alter the color assigned to such a vertex dependent on which triad it is considered to reside in .",

    "in particular , they implicitly arise in our derivation of lemmas [ lem : xi_pvm_span_lambda ] and [ lem : xi_pvm_disjoint ] which are crucial in deriving the coloring constraints ( [ colouring_constraints ] ) .",
    "there are several simple relations between the epistemic states and indicator functions of any ontological model which can be seen to follow almost immediately from the definitions of these distributions . in this appendix",
    "we outline those relations which are of use to us in the main text .",
    "the epistemic state @xmath302 associated with a preparation of state @xmath0 must have a support contained entirely within the support of the indicator function @xmath303 associated with a projective measurement @xmath1 , @xmath354 [ lem : lemma_mu_lt_xi ]    quantum mechanical statistics tell us that a system prepared according to @xmath0 should _ always _ pass a test @xmath1 , since @xmath355 . an ontological model attempts to reproduce this result through the integral , @xmath356 where we have made use of the fact that the integral over @xmath15 will only be non - zero within @xmath357 . noting that @xmath358 and recalling the normalization constraint ( [ mu_norm ] ) on @xmath302 we see that this integral can only take the required value of @xmath227 if it includes the whole of @xmath359 .",

    "<S> studying the extent to which realism is compatible with quantum mechanics teaches us something about the quantum mechanical universe , regardless of the validity of such realistic assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> it has also recently been appreciated that these kinds of studies are fruitful for questions relating to quantum information and computation . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by this , we extend the _ ontological model formalism _ for realistic theories to describe a set of theories emphasizing the role of measurement and preparation devices by introducing ` hidden variables ' to describe them . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate both the ontological model formalism and our generalization of it through a series of example models taken from the literature . </S>",
    "<S> our extension of the formalism allows us to quantitatively analyze the meaning contextuality ( a constraint on successful realistic theories ) , finding that - taken at face - value - it can be realized as a natural interaction between the configurations of a system and measurement device . </S>",
    "<S> however , we also describe a property that we call deficiency , which follows from contextuality , but does not admit such a natural interpretation . loosely speaking </S>",
    "<S> , deficiency breaks a symmetry between preparations and measurements in quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> it is the property that the set of ontic states which a system prepared in quantum state @xmath0 may actually be in , is strictly smaller than the set of ontic states which would reveal the measurement outcome @xmath1 with certainty . </S>"
