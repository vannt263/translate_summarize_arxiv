    "in the past decade there has been much interest in the hydrodynamics of relativistic conformal field theories ( cfts ) , largely due to the ads / cft correspondence between ( quantum ) gravitational theories on asymptotically anti - de - sitter ( ads ) spacetimes in @xmath0 dimensions and cfts in @xmath1 dimensions @xcite . in @xcite it was shown explicitly that the @xmath1-dimensional cft hydrodynamics equations are dual to the gravitational field equations describing the evolution of large scale perturbations of the @xmath0-dimensional black brane .",
    "this has been dubbed the fluid - gravity correspondence .",
    "it has been noticed that this correspondence naturally completes the picture of the old membrane paradigm @xcite of the 1980 s , where black hole horizons are thought of as being analogous to fictitious viscous fluids . in this case , however , the dynamics of the entire spacetime is encoded holographically into the fluid living at the boundary of the spacetime and not at the event horizon @xcite .    on the other hand , at least in some circumstances",
    ", the horizon membrane paradigm can be modernized within the context of hydrodynamics as an effective field theory and the fluid - gravity correspondence .",
    "the starting point is an equilibrium solution containing a timelike killing vector field and a stationary causal horizon .",
    "this solution is associated with a thermal state at uniform temperature .",
    "a general thermal state out of equilibrium is described by an inhomogeneous black hole , which is not an exact solution . however , when a hydrodynamic limit exists , we can work in a derivative expansion , assuming that there is no singularity at the horizon . in @xcite",
    "we applied this approach to the event horizon of a boosted einstein - yang - mills black brane in an asymptotically ads spacetime . at lowest orders in derivatives ,",
    "the set of einstein and maxwell equations projected into the horizon surface describe the hydrodynamics of a cft with anomalous global non - abelian charges . here",
    "we will briefly describe the formalism used in @xcite and show how it can be applied to the simplest case of an uncharged black brane @xcite .",
    "in the bulk spacetime , we choose coordinates of the form @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath3 are coordinates on the horizon @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 is a transverse coordinate , with @xmath6 on the horizon .",
    "@xmath7 is a null covector tangent to the @xmath4 .",
    "when raised with the metric , it gives a vector field @xmath8 which is both normal and tangent to the horizon , and tangent to its null generators . in components",
    ", we have @xmath9 .",
    "the pullback of @xmath10 into @xmath4 is the degenerate horizon metric @xmath11 .",
    "its null directions are the generating light - rays of @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath12 . the lie derivative of @xmath11 along @xmath13 gives us the shear / expansion tensor , or `` second fundamental form '' : @xmath14 we can write a decomposition of @xmath15 into a shear tensor @xmath16 and an expansion coefficient @xmath17 : @xmath18 we found it is convenient raise indices with @xmath19 , which is the inverse of any matrix @xmath20 of the form @xmath21 here we introduced the superfluous scalar field @xmath22 for later convenience : it will turn out that a matrix of the form coincides at leading order with the metric @xmath23 associated with the hydrodynamic dual .",
    "since @xmath11 is degenerate , one can not use it to define an intrinsic connection on the null horizon , as could be done for spacelike or timelike hypersurfaces .",
    "the bulk spacetime s connection does induce a notion of parallel transport in @xmath4 , but only along its null generators .",
    "this structure is not fully captured by @xmath11 ; instead , it is encoded by the extrinsic curvature , or",
    "weingarten map @xmath24 , which is the horizon restriction of @xmath25 : @xmath26 one can show that given an arbitrary @xmath20 of the form , @xmath24 can be written as : @xmath27 @xmath28 is the  surface gravity \" , which measures the non - affinity of @xmath13 .",
    "the covector @xmath29 encodes the degrees of freedom in @xmath24 which are independent of @xmath11 . in the hydrodynamics",
    ", these degrees of freedom will roughly correspond to the velocity and temperature fields .    in their usual form ,",
    "the gauss - codazzi equations involve the divergence of a hypersurface s extrinsic curvature .",
    "our null horizon , however , does not possess an intrinsic connection , and a covariant divergence of @xmath24 can not be defined .",
    "the solution is to define a tensor _ density _ constructed out of @xmath24 in the following manner @xcite : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a scalar density equal to the horizon area density .",
    "it turns out that the horizon - intrinsic covariant divergence @xmath32 is uniquely defined . using this divergence ,",
    "the null gauss - codazzi equation can be written as @xmath33 } - v\\partial_\\mu\\theta , \\label{eq : gc_basic}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined the area entropy current @xmath34 .",
    "this is the form we we will use for calculations .",
    "the vacuum einstein equations with negative cosmological constant can be expressed as @xmath35 these equations have the homogeneous ( boosted ) black brane solution @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "@xmath13 is normalized @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the horizon quantities defined in the above section can be expressed in terms of the bekenstein - hawking entropy density @xmath40 and the hawking temperature @xmath41 @xmath42 where the superscript zero anticipates inhomogeneous corrections .",
    "consider again the configuration , but with @xmath43 slowly varying functions of @xmath3 rather than constants .",
    "we will interpret this @xmath3-dependence by treating these quantities as fields on the brane s horizon @xmath4 .",
    "various quantities and equations can be expanded order by order in powers of the small @xmath44 derivatives .",
    "we use the symbolic small parameter @xmath45 to count these powers .",
    "we will refer to the power of @xmath45 involved as the `` order '' of a quantity or an equation .",
    "in general , with @xmath3-dependent parameters will not be a solution of the field equations .",
    "our analysis will take place on the event horizon @xmath4 of the exact inhomogeneous solution . in the configuration with inhomogeneous @xmath43 ,",
    "the hypersurface @xmath46 is null , and does nt intersect the singularity .",
    "it is therefore an event horizon for the zeroth - order solution , and a zeroth - order approximation for the horizon of the corresponding exact solution . for the corrected solution",
    ", we will still use coordinates so that @xmath6 on @xmath4 .",
    "the gauss - codazzi equation reads at first order , @xmath47 } =   o(\\varepsilon^2 ) .",
    "\\label{eq : gc_1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] plugging in the zeroth - order values , and using the thermodynamic identities @xmath48 and @xmath49 , we rearrange the equation to get the conservation of a perfect fluid stress tensor @xmath50 for the black brane one can show that @xmath51 , so the fluid is conformal , as expected .",
    "now we want to consider the gauss - codazzi equations at second order .",
    "obviously , before we write down these equations , we must consider the possible first - order corrections to the horizon ansatz .",
    "first of all , at viscous order in hydrodynamics there is naturally an ambiguity in definition of the fluid four - velocity .",
    "we make the ( somewhat non - standard , but here natural ) choice that the four - velocity is the direction of the entropy velocity ; that is we fix the direction of the entropy velocity @xmath13 and the magnitude of the entropy density @xmath52 by requiring that they have the values in eq . without corrections .",
    "due to this condition , the correction to @xmath11 must be transverse to @xmath13 and traceless with respect to @xmath53 .",
    "we will find that the precise form of @xmath54 is otherwise irrelevant to the constraint equations .",
    "let us now turn to the @xmath29 component of the extrinsic curvature . for our uncharged black brane , the most general correction to @xmath29 reads @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are functions of @xmath52 .",
    "the requirement for the constraint equations to take the form of conservation laws will place restrictions on these functions . to start , we note that the horizon s first - order shear / expansion tensor can be derived directly from the zeroth - order metric via . using the ideal equations",
    ", one finds that @xmath58 and @xmath59 . where @xmath60 is the fluid shear tensor @xmath61 .",
    "let us now evaluate the second order pieces of the gauss - codazzi equation . plugging in , and using the ideal order hydrodynamics equations we find @xmath62 the first two terms can contribute to a relativistic conservation law equation .",
    "however , the last does not and therefore we must set @xmath63 . as a result , at second - order ,",
    "the gauss - codazzi equations have the form @xmath64 which are the relativistic hydrodynamics equations for a conformal fluid with shear viscosity @xmath65 .",
    "it is remarkable that in our analysis the dynamics of the null horizon does not encode an arbitrary hydrodynamic system : once the choices discussed above are made , the transport coefficients are uniquely determined . specifically , the shear viscosity , the bulk viscosity ( and in general , other quantities like conductivity , see @xcite ) are fixed by the null hypersurface equations to specific functions of state , while for a general fluid they may be arbitrary ( under the restriction of positive semi - definiteness ) .",
    "note however that in relation to membrane paradigm picture of @xcite , our construction can not capture all the dynamics of the theory at higher orders in the hydrodynamic @xmath45 expansion . nevertheless , to viscous order",
    "we are able to obtain the hydrodynamics of the boundary fluid by working with the equations for the null horizon .",
    "the reason is that we parametrized the membrane equations in terms of the thermodynamic variables associated with the boundary fluid and required the metric @xmath66 to match the boundary metric ( in this case @xmath53 ) . in principle",
    ", one can also write the equations in terms of variables associated with a generic @xmath67 hypersurface , thereby obtaining the hydrodynamics of those surfaces as described in @xcite .",
