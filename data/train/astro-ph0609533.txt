    "w49b ( g43.3 - 0.2 ) has the highest radio surface - brightness of all mixed - morphology supernova remnants ( snrs ) in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "snrs exhibiting centrally - filled x - rays inside an edge - brightened radio shell are referred to as mixed - morphology @xcite .",
    "a number of models have been proposed for mixed - morphology supernova remnants @xcite ; these models were designed to explain the larger ( i.e. older ) snrs by invoking interactions with a denser - than - average interstellar medium . the very high radio brightness and the x - ray properties of w49b",
    "make it a compelling object to study in detail , because it may be fundamentally different from other remnants of its class .",
    "high resolution x - ray spectra of w49b @xcite revealed elemental abundances enhanced in heavy elements , suggesting that w49b was the product of a type ia explosion .",
    "however , a subsequent study of absorption @xcite shows that w49b is at the same distance as the star forming region w49a ( 11.4kpc , * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , long wavelength radio observations @xcite suggest that w49b is absorbed by h@xmath2 gas and is in a high pressure ( @xmath3@xmath4 ) region of the galaxy , again associating the remnant with the w49a complex . but at this distance , w49b would have to have a massive progenitor , more akin to a type ii supernova .",
    "thus we have an observational inconsistency : w49b has enhanced iron abundances which are characteristic of a type ia supernova , yet it is located in a star forming region and more likely a result of a core - collapse explosion .",
    "recently , @xcite completed a study of w49b with xmm - newton , where they concluded that the x - ray emission arises in a high - metallicity collisionally - ionized plasma , with a temperature gradient from west to east .    in this _",
    "we present near - infrared narrow line imaging (  [ ir.sec ] ) , which we compare to our spectral analysis of _ chandra _ archival data (  [ chandra.sec ] ) . in  [ discussion.sec ]",
    "we interpret our results as evidence that w49b was created inside a wind - blown bubble within a molecular cloud .",
    "we also include two very different interpretations of our observations : ( 1 ) in  [ grb.sec ] we interpret our observations as consistent with a jet - driven explosion ( i.e.  gamma - ray burst ) ; and in  [ sn.sec ] we interpret our observations as the result of a traditional supernova explosion inside a complex cavity .",

    "the wirc is a 2048@xmath62048 rockwell hawaii - ii nir detector mounted at the f/3.3 prime focus , resulting in an 8.7  field of view with 0.25  pixels .",
    "we observed w49b with 4 filters ( see table  [ wirc.tab ] ) : two narrow line filters and two continuum filters in the 1.62.2@xmath0 m window .",
    "the purpose of the k@xmath10 continuum observation was to search for synchrotron emission from w49b , which was not observed . with each filter , we alternated observing on and off our source , with each on - source observation located at a slightly different position , well sampling our object as well as the nearby off - source sky .    because the wirc is a new instrument",
    ", we developed our own iraf package to implement the following procedure independently for each filter : ( 1 ) we subtracted off the median dark image with corresponding frame times from each image , and corrected for the non - linear response of the detector ; ( 2 ) we pixel - by - pixel median averaged our off - source images , with the highest two values rejected to eliminate stars , to form a _",
    "sky image _ ; ( 3 ) we subtracted the _ sky image _ off of each of our source images ; ( 4 ) we divided this image by a _",
    "standard flat _",
    "derived from the linear response of each pixel ; ( 5 ) we subtracted a single median off - source background level ; ( 6 ) we corrected for cross - field flux bias ; ( 7 ) we applied a world coordinate system to our images using the 2mass point - source catalog ; ( 8) we flux - calibrated our images using the 2mass point - source catalog ; ( 9 ) we mosaicked our images ; ( 10 ) we resubtracted the ambient background level ; and ( 11 ) we applied a final calibration using the 2mass point - source catalog .",
    "the photometric uncertainty was @xmath37% for the spectral line observations , and @xmath36% for k@xmath10 , and primarily limited by stellar confusion noise .",
    "the total narrow - band infrared flux densities are 30jy ( mag=3.4 , l=1@xmath6@xmath11erg / s ) in h@xmath5 and 61jy ( mag=3.1 , l=3@xmath6@xmath11erg / s ) in [ feii ] .",
    "we used these values to estimate the mass of fe@xmath2 ions and h@xmath5 molecules using multilevel excitation models and a wide range of physically - reasonable excitation conditions , including : all path lengths shorter than the remnant diameter ; all reasonable temperatures for the observed ionization state ; and pressures less than 1000 times the typical interstellar value ( also see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , the mass of fe@xmath2 must be between 0.2 and 20 @xmath12 , with the lower and higher masses corresponding to electron ( temperature , density ) of ( 1000 k , 8000 @xmath13 ) and ( 700 k , 1600 @xmath13 ) , respectively . for h@xmath5",

    "moreover , notice from table  [ parameters.tab ] the overall trend toward higher metallic abundances in the _ center _ , _ jet _ and _ eastern shell _ , as opposed to the outer regions of w49b .",
    "this same trend can be seen in images of the dominant he - like and h - like emission lines ( si , s , ar , ca , fe and ni ) , which are shown in fig .",

    "we also extracted a 4 - 6kev continuum image , which is morphologically similar to the si , s , ar and ca images .",

    "these mass estimates are also shown in table  [ parameters.tab ] .",
    "note that these fits imply a total x - ray - emitting fe mass on the rough order of @xmath93 . also , note that despite the clear abundance difference between west and east , the total fe mass is approximately symmetrical between the east and the west .",
    "the data presented here imply that w49b is the result of an unusual explosion of a massive or super - massive star .",
    "the barrel - shaped structure , as seen in the 1.64@xmath0 m [ feii ] emission , is also seen in the high - pass - filtered radio maps of @xcite , suggesting that the location of warm gas is correlated with high magnetic field .",
    "we interpret these as coaxial circular rings of enhanced density structures , such as is common in wind - blown bubbles ( e.g. ngc6888 , * ? ? ?",
    "most importantly , the [ feii ] emission defines the rotation axis of the progenitor star ; which is inclined by 70  from the line of sight . note that the [ feii ] emission arises from much cooler gas than the x - ray .",
    "we interpret the fe@xmath94 gas ( [ feii ] emission ) to be material from the progenitor s strong winds , while we interpret the h - like fe ( x - ray fe lines ) to most likely arise from ejecta ( as discussed below in  [ grb.sec ] ) .",
    "the h@xmath5 emission clearly shows a bow - shock structure in the southeast , emanating from the point of contact between the x - ray `` jet '' (  [ chandra.sec ] ) and the shell .",
    "the shock appears to have traveled a distance of 1.9pc inside the molecular gas , the thickness of the southeastern h@xmath5 emission . assuming that the molecular cloud is uniform density",
    ", the shock speed must be less than 40km / s in order to not dissociate the h@xmath5 .",
    "this velocity is consistent with an x - ray shock velocity of 1150 km s@xmath95 multiplied by @xmath96 , where n@xmath97 is a density inferred from x - ray gas of 1 - 3.5 @xmath13 , and @xmath98 is an h@xmath5 gas density of 3000 @xmath13 ; note the velocity is inversely proportional to square root of the density ratio .",
    "the complication with this interpretation is that it would take a 40km / s shock 45,000 years to travel the 1.9pc that is the apparent thickness of the h@xmath5 shell .",
    "thus , either : ( 1 ) the remnant actually is 45,000 years old ; ( 2 ) the thickness of the h@xmath5 shell is much less than 1.9pc ; or ( 3 ) the shock is moving much faster than 40km / s .",
    "each of these possibilities have their own implications : ( 1 ) a 45,000 year old remnant would have required a larger explosion energy and containment by the cavity to have such a high current x - ray temperature ; ( 2 ) complex projection effects would need to be invoked to significantly reduce the distance the shock had to travel in the molecular gas ; and ( 3 ) a magnetic precursor could propagate faster without dissociating the molecular hydrogen .",
    "elaborating on scenario ( 3 ) , we can estimate the ionization fraction in the molecular cloud by assuming that the h@xmath5 is excited by a magnetic precursor propagating at the ion - magnetosonic speed ( @xmath99 ) , as in the cygnus loop @xcite and some herbig - haro objects ( e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "if we also assume equipartition between the magnetic and gas pressures , an age of about 2000 years , and a sound speed of about 3km / s (  [ ir.sec ] ) , the ionization fraction in the molecular cloud would be @xmath100 , because @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the ion mass density .    the chandra (  [ chandra.sec ] ) and xmm - newton @xcite data show ni overabundances and concentrated fe at the _ center _ , which also support an explosion of a massive or super - massive star .",
    "we explore two viable interpretations for this morphology and chemical structure . the first interpretation (  [ grb.sec ] ) is that w49b resulted from a jet - driven explosion producing the _ jet _ , chemical structure and h@xmath5 bow shock structure . the alternative interpretation (  [ sn.sec ] ) is that the explosion was itself symmetrical , but rather the jet structure is the result of interactions between the shock and an enriched interstellar cloud .",
    "a mild consensus has formed regarding the nature of long / soft gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) : they are the result of massive stellar collapse which produces a highly collimated relativistic blast wave along the poles of the rotation axis of the core of the progenitor star as it collapses to form a black hole @xcite .",
    "this conical blast wave will continue moving forward until it becomes semi - relativistic , at which point it will start expanding perpendicular to the jet @xcite .",
    "this model has been applied successfully to the light curves of grb afterglows , explaining the sharp steepening of the light curve when the shock slows down and @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the lorentz factor of the blast wave and @xmath105 is the opening half - angle of the jet , which are believed to be @xmath310  on average @xcite .",
    "the distance that the jet travels , the _ jet - break distance _ , depends on the mass it sweeps - up , but this is typically a few parsecs .",
    "( at a distance of 11.4kpc , the length of the _ jet _ region is about 4pc , which would be w49b s observed jet - break distance . )",
    "the frequency of observed grbs is approximately one per @xmath106 years per galaxy @xcite .",
    "however , we only observe a fraction of the explosions @xmath107 due to beaming effects , where @xmath108 , increasing the rate to about one per 100,000 years per galaxy , assuming the canonical 10  opening angle .",
    "thus , depending on the length of time the distinguishing characteristics remain intact , it is possible that at least one remnant of a jet - driven explosion could be found in the milky way .",
    "these explosions result from the most massive stars , so they should occur within the molecular clouds which formed them @xcite .",
    "given that the most massive stars go through phases of high mass - loss rate ( e.g.  lbv phase ) and fast stellar winds ( e.g.wolf-rayet phase ) , one would also expect their remnants to be located inside bubbles within molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "therefore , the distinguishing characteristics of a remnant of a jet - driven explosion inside a massive star should include the following : ( 1 ) a double t - shaped structure , which traces the path of the bipolar jets ; ( 2 ) a higher abundance of heavy elements than a typical type ii snr , because the jet originates from inside the iron core ; ( 3 ) a supermassive progenitor with strong stellar winds ; and ( 4 ) the nonexistence of a neutron star .",
    "evidence for these include : ( 1 ) the double t - shaped structure is observed in the x - ray images ( see figures [ 3color.fig ] and [ xray_lines.fig ] and the figures in * ? ? ? * ) and the radio maps @xcite ; ( 2 ) _ chandra _ (  [ chandra.sec ] ) and _ xmm - newton _ @xcite",
    "both observe an overabundance of ni and fe in the _ center _ and _ jet _ regions ; ( 3 ) the infrared images show evidence for past stellar winds interacting with a dense circumstellar medium as would be expected from a supermassive progenitor ; and ( 4 ) there is no evidence for a neutron star in the _ chandra _ data .",
    "when the star collapses , the resulting twin - jets emerge from the poles leaving behind material from the stellar core , thus explaining the enhanced abundances in the _ center _ , _",
    "jet _ and _ eastern shell _ regions (  [ chandra.sec ] , * ? ? ?",
    "the jet continues until it encounters enough mass to slow to semi - relativistic speeds ( i.e.  it _ breaks _ ) , which will happen at the bubble wall , if not before , because of the large density of the molecular cloud .",
    "this will result in both a transmitted shock into the dense bubble and a reflected shock back into the cavity .",
    "the morphology of w49b ( fig .",
    "[ 3color.fig ] ) suggests that the southeastern jet broke at the bubble wall , while the northwestern jet broke before hitting the bubble wall .",
    "this interpretation would explain the clear morphological structure of the southeastern jet , as well as the more complex northwestern jet .",
    "this hypothesis also explains the relative brightness of the western [ feii ] emission compared to the x - ray , implying cooler gas in the west as observed here and by @xcite .",
    "this is also consistent with the observed @xmath109co map of @xcite , which shows more molecular gas to the north and west of w49b than the south and east .",
    "moreover , an early western jet - break would also dilute the ejecta , explaining the lower abundances in the west compared to the east  yet there should be about the same fe mass overall , which is observed ( tab.[parameters.tab ] ) .",
    "an issue to consider is the short cooling time of [ feii ] , which requires a continuous heating source for the fe@xmath2 gas .",
    "thus , either the fe@xmath2 shell is currently being shocked , or it is gaining energy from the adjacent x - ray emitting hot plasma .",
    "the thermal energy currently contained in the x - ray plasma is much greater than the thermal energy in fe@xmath2 ( only about 10@xmath110 ergs ) so this seems plausible .",
    "an isotropic explosion inside a wind - blown bubble could also produce these observations , assuming a unique structure of the surrounding medium .",
    "the obvious problem , however , is the clear bipolar structure in the infrared data images .",
    "a solution may be a strong and ordered magnetic field , which is consistent with w49b s high radio surface brightness , the radio and [ feii ] hoop morphology , and the possible magnetic precursor in the h@xmath5 cloud .",
    "the x - ray jet morphology and abundance variations could possibly be explained under this model by postulating a metallically enriched clump of fast moving ejecta which was overtaken by one of the supernova shocks .",
    "the shock would break up the clump , spreading the material in a line parallel to the shock velocity .",
    "thus the resulting density enhancement would be elongated radially , and have an overabundance of heavy elements .",
    "@xcite compare w49b to the snr g292.08 + 1.8 , which has an apparently similar x - ray morphology , but has been interpreted to contain a disk or torus of material viewed edge - on @xcite .",
    "we disfavor this interpretation for w49b , because the axis of the torus would need to be perpendicular to the axis of the bipolar wind structures presented here , so they could not have been caused by the same progenitor star .",
    "another advantage of the supernova model is that w49b s abundances are more consistent with the 25m@xmath111 models of @xcite than their 40m@xmath111 hypernova models @xcite .",
    "however , given the infancy of detailed grb models in 2003 , and the more important chemical morphology , we believe this argument to be weak .    this interpretation has the advantage that traditional supernova explosions , inside complex cloud regions , are common well - known occurrences .",
    "on the other hand , its primary flaw is that it posits particular cloud configurations to explain particular morphological structures .",
    "we have presented evidence that w49b resulted from the explosion of a supermassive star , inside a wind - blown bubble , which is in turn interior to a dense molecular cloud .",
    "we have also given two interpretations for its morphological and chemical structure , each explanation require a set of extreme initial conditions .",
    "one interpretation assumed that the axially - symmetric structure is caused by the explosion mechanism , resulting in the conclusion that w49b was a jet - driven explosion akin to the current model of long / soft gamma - ray bursts .",
    "the other interpretation assumed that the same observations were rather dominated by complex cloud and magnetic field structures , and that the explosion could have been a standard isotropic supernova explosion .",
    "additional observations would also be useful , especially in order to understand complete yields of nucleosynthesis with infrared spectroscopy by complementing the yields of the x - ray gas , and to independently map out the molecular cloud structure surrounding w49b .",
