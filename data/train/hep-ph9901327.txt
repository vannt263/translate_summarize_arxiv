    "the final state interaction ( fsi ) in the nonleptonic @xmath0 decay has been an important unsolved issue in connection with the search of direct cp violations . unlike the short - distance fsi",
    ", the long - distance fsi has not been understood well enough even qualitatively .",
    "the experimental data of the @xmath5 decay clearly show that the fsi phases are large in the @xmath6 decay modes@xcite .",
    "opinions divide as to how strong the fsi is in the @xmath0 decay .",
    "some theorists have suggested that the long - distance fsi should be small at the mass scale of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "but others have obtained large fsi phases by numerical computations based on various dynamical assumptions and approximations . according to the latest data ,",
    "the fsi phases are tightly bounded for @xmath7 and a little less so for @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10@xcite .",
    "however , the tight bounds are closely tied to smallness of the so - called color - suppressed modes .",
    "is the smallness of the fsi phases special only to those sets of modes for which the color suppression occurs ? if it is more general , where does transition occur from large fsi phases to small fsi phases in terms of the mass scale of a decaying particle ?",
    "although the process is not a weak decay , the @xmath2 decay falls between the @xmath5 decay and the @xmath0 decay in terms of energy scale . since the time scale of the strong and electromagnetic decay processes of @xmath2 is much shorter than that of the long - distance fsi , the decay interactions of @xmath2 act just like the weak interactions of the @xmath5 and the @xmath0 decay as far as the long - distance fsi is concerned . for this reason ,",
    "analysis of the @xmath2 decay amplitudes provides one extrapolation from the @xmath5 mass toward the @xmath0 mass . among the two - body decay modes of @xmath2 , most extensively measured are the @xmath11 modes .",
    "a detailed analysis of those decay amplitudes with broken flavor su(3 ) symmetry found a large relative phase of fsi ( @xmath12 ) between the one - photon and the gluon decay amplitudes@xcite .",
    "since there are many independent su(3 ) amplitudes for the @xmath11 decay , the analysis involved one assumption of simplification on assignment of the fsi phases .    in this short paper , we shall study the @xmath1 decay modes of @xmath2 which are much simpler in the su(3 ) structure .",
    "the result of analysis turns out clearer and more convincing .",
    "once the asymptotic behavior of the electromagnetic form factors is incorporated in analysis , the current data favor a very large fsi phase difference between the one - photon and the gluon decay amplitudes .",
    "in order to formulate the fsi , it is customary to separate interactions into three parts , the decay interaction , the rescattering interaction , and the hadron formation interaction .",
    "separation between the second and the third can be done only heuristically at best , not at the level of lagrangian .",
    "one way to circumvent this ambiguity and see general properties of the fsi is to break up decay amplitudes in the eigenchannels of the strong interaction s - matrix : @xmath13 an observed two - body final state can be expanded in the eigenchannels with an orthogonal matrix as @xmath14 where the superscript `` in '' stands for the incoming state . in terms of the `` in '' and `` out '' states , the s - matrix of eq.([eigenchannel ] ) can be expressed as @xmath15 .",
    "when the effective decay interactions @xmath16 , in which we include all coefficients , are time - reversal invariant , the decay amplitude for @xmath17 is given in the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the decay amplitude into the eigenchannel @xmath20 through @xmath16 ; @xmath21 and @xmath22 is real . contains a short - distance fsi phase , which is transferred into @xmath23 in eq.([6 ] ) . ]",
    "two interactions are relevant to the @xmath2 decay .",
    "for the one - photon annihilation , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the vector field of @xmath2 .",
    "for the gluon annihilation , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a vector function of the gluon field tensor @xmath28 and its derivatives which is calculated in perturbative qcd . when the terms from the same decay interaction are grouped together , eq.([general ] ) takes the form , @xmath29 where @xmath30 we emphasize here that the net fsi phase @xmath23 of @xmath31 depends on @xmath16 through @xmath32 even for the same state @xmath33 when more than one eigenchannel is open . specifically in the @xmath2 decay",
    ", @xmath23 is different between the one - photon and the three - gluon decay amplitude even for the same isospin state .",
    "if the fsi is strong in the @xmath2 decay , a large phase difference @xmath34 can arise .",
    "our aim is to learn about @xmath35 from the decay @xmath36 .",
    "one feature of the @xmath37 is particularly advantageous to our study : there is no su(3 ) symmetric decay amplitude for the gluon decay .",
    "charge conjugation does not allow a @xmath1 state to be in an su(3 ) singlet state of @xmath38 .",
    "therefore the @xmath1 final states through the gluon decay must be in an octet along the su(3 ) breaking direction of @xmath39 .",
    "since the leading term of the three - gluon decay is su(3)-breaking , the one - photon process competes with the otherwise dominant gluon process , making it easier to determine a relative fsi phase through interference .",
    "the @xmath2 amplitudes are parametrized in terms of the reduced su(3 ) amplitudes , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , as follows : @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the @xmath46 flavor matrices of the @xmath47meson octet and @xmath48)/2 .",
    "@xmath40 is for the gluon decay while @xmath41 and @xmath42 are for the one - photon annihilation and the su(3 ) breaking correction to it , respectively .",
    "breaking to the one - photon annihilation @xmath49 has the same group structure as @xmath40 . ]",
    "no * 10 * or @xmath50 representation of @xmath1 arises from multiple insertions of @xmath39 alone .",
    "charge conjugation invariance amounts to antisymmetrization in @xmath51 , which forbids the * 27 * -representation of @xmath1 .",
    "we have normalized each reduced amplitude such that sum of individual amplitudes squared be common .",
    "the decay amplitudes for the observed modes are listed in table 1 in this parametrization .",
    "also listed are the absolute values of the measured amplitudes@xcite after small phase - space corrections are made .",
    "if the flavor su(3 ) is a decent symmetry , @xmath42 must be a fraction of @xmath41 .",
    "knowing the magnitude of typical flavor - su(3 ) breakings , let us allow @xmath52",
    "the one - photon annihilation amplitudes @xmath41 and @xmath42 describe the electromagnetic form factors too .",
    "we have some theoretical understanding of their asymptotic behaviors . according to the perturbative qcd analysis@xcite",
    ", the leading asymptotic behavior of the form factor for meson @xmath53 is given by @xmath54^{\\gamma_i } } \\biggr ) ,              \\label{asym}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the decay constant of @xmath56 , @xmath57 is the qcd coupling , and @xmath58 are positive constants .",
    "@xmath59 approaches a real value as @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , the one - photon amplitudes @xmath41 and @xmath42 have a common phase ( = 0 ) in this limit : @xmath61 since @xmath62 , we expect @xmath63 .",
    "the physical picture of this inequality is obvious in the spacelike region of @xmath64 : difference between @xmath65 and @xmath66 is @xmath67 _ vs _ @xmath68 in the valence quark content .",
    "the @xmath68 quark , being a little heavier , is harder in momentum distribution inside @xmath65 than the @xmath67 quark is inside @xmath66 .",
    "this leads to a stiffer form factor for @xmath65 than for @xmath66 , though an accurate theoretical estimate of @xmath69 is not possible for finite @xmath64 . with @xmath70 , @xmath71 as @xmath72 . combining eq.([ratio ] ) with eq.([arg ] ) , we obtain @xmath73 .",
    "when we keep the nonleading logarithmic terms , there is a small relative phase between @xmath41 and @xmath42 ; @xmath74^{1+\\gamma_1}}\\biggr).\\ ] ] we may ignore it since it can be treated as a correction to the symmetry - breaking correction term @xmath42 .",
    "if it happens that vector resonances of light quarks exist just around the @xmath2 mass , the form factors would not be asymptotic at this energy . if such high mass resonances should have a substantial branching into the @xmath1 channels",
    ", the nonleading logarithmic terms would add up to a nonnegligible magnitude in eq.([asym ] ) . in this case the phases of @xmath41 and @xmath42 would not be small .",
    "one may wonder about whether a mass splitting of the resonances might generate a large phase difference between @xmath42 and @xmath41 .",
    "however , the widths of such resonances , if any , would be so broad at such high mass that the mass splitting effect would be largely washed out . and @xmath41 .",
    "] therefore we expect that the phase equality of eq.([arg ] ) should hold in a good approximation . in our numerical analysis",
    "we shall set the phases of @xmath41 and @xmath42 to a common value and impose the condition of @xmath75 at @xmath76 : @xmath77      if we attempt to fit the data with the leading terms @xmath40 and @xmath41 alone without fsi phases , the result is unacceptable .",
    "the fit of the minimum @xmath78 is obtained for @xmath79 and @xmath80 leading to @xmath81 for only three data .",
    "we then include @xmath42 to fit the data . if we ignored the constraint of eq.([constraint ] ) , the amplitudes could be fitted with @xmath82 this set of numbers would give @xmath83 contrary to @xmath84 .",
    "when we include the constraint @xmath85 , the fit of the best @xmath78 is back to @xmath86 of @xmath81 . the same poor fit with @xmath40 and @xmath41 alone .",
    "it is fairly obvious why we can not fit the data .",
    "looking up the parametrization in table i , we see that without phases the @xmath87 amplitude must be larger in magnitude than sum of the @xmath88 and the @xmath89 amplitude for @xmath90 .",
    "the measured values badly violate this inequality .",
    "the natural recourse is to introduce fsi phases for the amplitudes .",
    "we first try with @xmath40 and @xmath41 alone . defining the relative fsi phase between @xmath40 and @xmath41 by @xmath91 we can fit the amplitudes with @xmath92 where @xmath35 is defined between @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the attached uncertainty comes from the experimental errors of the branching fractions , which are treated as uncorrelated here . since we determine @xmath35 through @xmath95 which is sensitive to small experimental errors near @xmath96 , the uncertainty in eq.([thefit ] ) turns out to be a little larger than one might expect from those of the branching fractions .",
    "one may wonder how much @xmath35 can be reduced by adding the breaking term @xmath42 with the constraint of eq.([constraint ] ) .",
    "the result is plotted in fig.1 .",
    "dependence of @xmath35 on the ratio @xmath97 is very mild : @xmath35 decreases slowly and monotonically from @xmath98 at @xmath99 to @xmath100 at the edge of the allowed range , @xmath101 .",
    "even if the fsi phases of @xmath41 and @xmath42 are left independent , it is fairly obvious that we can not fit the data with small values for all phase differences under the constraint @xmath102 .",
    "we have thus come to the conclusion that the fsi phase difference between the one - photon and the gluon decay amplitudes is very large , as large as @xmath98 . for this magnitude",
    ", it must come mostly from the long - distance fsi .",
    "our conclusion of large fsi phases has a profound implication in the @xmath0 decay .",
    "the important input leading to this conclusion is that the electromagnetic form factor of @xmath65 does not fall faster than that of @xmath66 .",
    "while it is very reasonable in perturbative qcd , we can in principle test this postulate in experiment . just measure the ratio of the one - photon annihilation cross sections for @xmath103 and @xmath87 off the @xmath2 peak .",
    "we do not have good data on the ratio @xmath104 off the peak .",
    "experiment requires time and a good @xmath105 separation .",
    "a measurement will certainly have a great impact on the issue of the long - distance fsi in heavy particle decays .",
    "the magnitude of measured cross sections will also tell how close the form factors are to their asymptotic limits and therefore how small the phases of @xmath41 and @xmath42 are .",
    "even a value of the unseparated ratio @xmath106 off the peak will throw in one more input in the analysis .",
