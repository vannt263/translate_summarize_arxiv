    "this led the authors to use a fitting procedure that does not involve fitting of a straight line and even to consider the possibility that the exponent @xmath28 might not exist in these non - fibonacci systems .",
    "in this work we fit the power law  ( [ eq : delta ] ) to the calculated values of @xmath85 ( for many values of @xmath86 equidistant in the logarithmic scale ) by fitting of the expression @xmath87 in all intervals containing @xmath86 values spanning at least one decade in @xmath79 ( for easier comparison , this corresponds to a change in @xmath82 of at least @xmath88 in the plots ) , and selecting among the obtained fits of @xmath28 those that have @xmath89 values closest to @xmath90 .",

    "there is , however , a small curvature in the dependence of @xmath96 on @xmath82 for the crossover times inbetween regimes ( i ) and ( ii ) as well as ( ii ) and ( iii ) .",

    "the obtained values for @xmath29 are independent of the dimensionality , which we have linked to the properties of the inverse participation numbers .    even though these results are certainly related to the product structure of the quasiperiodic systems studied here , it is quite possible that they describe some features of generic higher - dimensional quasiperiodic systems .",
    "in particular , we found an exact relation among the exponent @xmath28 and corresponding exponents @xmath170 of the dynamics of the projection onto subintervals of the spectrum of a wave packet initially localized at a single site , and compared the dynamics of wave packets in the silver - mean quasiperiodic tiling constructed from about @xmath133 of the total number of states near various energies in the band with a study of generalized quasiperiodic rauzi tilings in ref .",
    ". there seems to be a similarity between the two in so far that wave packets of states near the band edge are spreading much faster than those made out of the states near the band center .",
    "however , while in the latter work dynamics of these wave packets is , respectively , ballistic and anomalously diffusive , we find that the dynamics is , respectively , anomalously diffusive and , for the wave packets made out of band - center states , slower than any anomalous diffusion .                                  c.  tang and m.  kohmoto , phys .",
