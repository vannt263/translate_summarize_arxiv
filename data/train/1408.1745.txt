    "in large classes of particle - physics models , there exist massive long - lived particles .",
    "even though they may not be accessed by the currently available colliders , information about those particles may be obtained from astrophysical and cosmological observations .",
    "if they are produced in the early universe and also if they decay in or near the present epoch , their decay products may affect the fluxes of high - energy cosmic rays , resulting in constraints on their relic densities , lifetimes , decay modes , and so on .",
    "in addition , models with long - lived particles have been attracted attentions to explain the results of cosmic - ray observations @xcite . in particular , implications of the decay processes into @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and ( anti- ) proton have been extensively studied .    with the successful detections of high - energy cosmic - ray neutrino events at icecube @xcite ,",
    "our understanding about the cosmic - ray neutrino flux is also significantly improving .",
    "in particular , the icecube collaboration claims that the cosmic - ray neutrino flux in the sub - pev to pev region is well above that of expected backgrounds , which suggests a new source of high - energy cosmic - ray neutrinos . after the icecube results are released , it has been discussed that the decay of heavy particles may be responsible for the icecube events @xcite . for other explanations for the icecube result , including astrophysical ones ,",
    "see the review @xcite and the references therein .",
    "importantly , the lifetime of the long - lived particle ( potentially ) responsible for the icecube events can be either longer or shorter than the present cosmic time .",
    "in particular , the present authors have argued that the decay of a long - lived particle ( called @xmath4 ) in the past can be the origin of the high - energy neutrinos observed by icecube @xcite .",
    "we call this scenario `` early - decay scenario , '' in contrast to the ones with decaying dark matter . in the previous study",
    ", we have calculated the neutrino flux originating from the decay of @xmath4 for the case where the neutrino scattering processes with background neutrinos are negligible ( which is the case when the decay of @xmath4 occurs at the epoch of @xmath5 , with @xmath6 being the redshift ) , and have pointed out that the icecube events may be well explained in this scenario .    in this paper , we extend our previous study and discuss astrophysical and cosmological constraints on the early - decay scenario .",
    "we pay particular attention to the effects of the neutrino scattering processes with background neutrinos , which are not completely taken into account in our previous study .",
    "we calculate the flux of cosmic - ray neutrinos originating from the decay of @xmath4 .",
    "then , comparing the result with the observed cosmic - ray neutrino flux , we derive an upper bound on the primordial abundance of @xmath4 . in addition , photons and charged particles are also produced in association with the neutrino scattering processes ; they result in the spectral distortion of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and the change of the light - element abundances produced by the big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) , from which we obtain an upper bound on the abundance of @xmath4 . for the study of the constraints from the cmb distortion , we take into account the present bound ( cobe / firas @xcite ) , or the expected bound in the future ( for example , pixie @xcite and prism @xcite ) . in our study , we will not specify the detailed particle - physics model which contains the candidate of @xmath4 , but we perform our analysis as general as possible .",
    "we discuss the constraints on the scenario using the properties of @xmath4 , i.e. , its lifetime , energy distribution of the final - state neutrinos ( which is assumed to be monochromatic in this paper ) , and its primordial relic density .",
    "we also discuss the implication of the icecube result in light of the early - decay scenario .",
    "in particular , it may be possible that the neutrino excess in sub - pev region and the possible cutoff around pev are simultaneously explained if we take into account the effect of the neutrinos scattered by the background neutrinos .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : effects ] we discuss the evolution of the neutrino flux originating from the massive decaying particle @xmath4 .",
    "the effects of the produced neutrinos on the cmb distortions and the light - element abundances are also explained there .",
    "then , in the following section , we give constraints on the primordial relic density of @xmath4 using the observation of the cosmic - ray neutrino flux , the cmb distortions and the light - element abundances produced by the bbn . in sec .",
    "[ sec : implication ] we discuss possible interpretations of the recent icecube high - energy neutrino events in our scenario .",
    "the final section is devoted to the conclusions and discussion .",
    "let us first discuss the evolution of the neutrino flux produced by the decay of the parent particle @xmath4 .",
    "once produced , the neutrinos propagate in the expanding universe scattering off background particles ( in particular , neutrinos ) .",
    "then , in order to obtain the neutrino flux in @xmath7-th flavor , @xmath8 , which is related to the number density of the @xmath7-th flavor neutrino as @xmath9 , we solve the following boltzmann equation : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the expansion rate of the universe , and @xmath12 is the source term .",
    "in addition @xmath13 is the scattering rate , and @xmath14 is the ( differential ) neutrino production rate with @xmath15 and @xmath16 being the energies of initial- and final - state neutrinos .",

    "thus , we take @xmath19 . in our calculation , the effect of the neutrino oscillation is taken into account by introducing the `` transition probability '' @xmath20 .",
    "we approximate that the flavors are fully mixed in the case where the time scale of the neutrino oscillation ( i.e. , @xmath21 or @xmath22 ) is shorter than the mean free time ( i.e. , @xmath23 ) , and that the effect of the neutrino oscillation is negligible in the opposite case .",

    "if a sizable amount of neutrino propagated from the epochs of 1 or 2 to the present epoch without being scattered , we would fail to include the effects of neutrino oscillation during the propagation .",
    "however in reality , @xmath33 for @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the optical depth of neutrino defined in eq .",

    "we also note here that the prism experiment may provide another accurate probe of the @xmath136- and @xmath56-parameters . in @xcite",
    ", it is claimed that the sensitivity of the prism experiment can be as good as @xmath204 , where @xmath205 is the total amount of the energy release from decaying particles , which may correspond to a better sensitivity than the pixie experiment . with detection sensitivities other than eqs .   and",
    ", the value of @xmath180 required for the detection of the signal can be obtained by rescaling the values shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pixie ] .",
    "so far , we have assumed that @xmath4 dominantly decays into neutrinos .",
    "if electromagnetic particles are efficiently emitted by the decay of @xmath4 , however , we should also consider constraints from these decay products .",
    "we briefly comment on such a case although it is beyond the scope of our study . when @xmath206 , the electromagnetic particles produced by @xmath4 contribute to the @xmath56-type and @xmath136-type distortions or the dissociation processes of the light elements after causing the electromagnetic cascade discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : evol ] . for @xmath207 ,",
    "the neutrino scattering processes are so efficient that the neutrinos produced by @xmath4 also induce the electromagnetic cascade . as a result ,",
    "if the same amount of neutrinos and electromagnetic particles are produced by @xmath4 , the constraint on @xmath80 due to the distortion of the cmb spectrum or the light - element abundances is expected to be more - or - less unchanged for such a parameter region . for @xmath208 , however , the constraint from electromagnetic particles due to the distortion of the cmb spectrum or the light - element abundances is stronger than that from neutrinos .",
    "when @xmath209 , on the contrary , electromagnetic particles produced by @xmath4 may change the ionization history , which also gives the constraint on the injection of electromagnetic particles @xcite .",
    "in this section , we discuss the implications of the early - decay scenario for the explanation of the origin of the high - energy cosmic - ray neutrinos observed by the icecube collaboration .",
    "recently , the icecube collaboration has published the results of their three - year observation of high - energy neutrinos @xcite .",
    "they detected three high - energy neutrino events ( nicknamed as bert , ernie , and big bird ) with the deposited energy of @xmath210 .",
    "the number is well above the expected background .",
    "in addition to the pev neutrino events , the icecube collaboration detected 34 events in the energy region of @xmath211 , thus finding 37 events in total . considering that the expected background is @xmath212 from cosmic - ray muons and @xmath213 from atmospheric neutrinos in this energy region @xcite , this gap suggests a new source of the energetic cosmic - ray neutrinos .",
    "the icecube collaboration claims that the per - flavor flux of @xmath214 in the energy region of @xmath215 is consistent with the detected 37 events .",
    "it is also claimed that , if the unbroken @xmath216 power law spectrum is adopted , additional 3.1 events is expected above @xmath217 , while no event is observed in this energy region .",
    "one possibility is that the neutrino spectrum obeys @xmath218 power law with the cutoff at the energy slightly above @xmath219 @xcite .    because the origin of the high - energy cosmic - ray neutrino flux is yet unknown , we pursue the possibility that the decay of an exotic particle is responsible for it .",
    "we will see that the three pev neutrino events at icecube can be well explained in the present scenario .",
    "in addition , we will also see that @xmath216 power law with the cutoff at a few pev may be realized , since the neutrino flux at the energy higher than the position of the peak is exponentially suppressed .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ic ] , we show the present neutrino flux for two sample points , which are given by    * sample point 1 ( left panel ) : @xmath220 , * sample point 2 ( right panel ) : @xmath221 .    the neutrinos produced by @xmath4 are very transparent for the case of the sample point 1 . on the contrary , for the sample point 2",
    ", a sizable amount of the initial neutrinos produced by @xmath4 is scattered and the secondary neutrinos also contribute to the present neutrino flux . in both sample points ,",
    "the flux is @xmath222 at around pev , so they may explain the icecube pev events .",
    "in the right panel in fig .  [",
    "fig : ic ] , one can also see that the energy dependence of the flux is close to @xmath216 for @xmath223 .",
    "therefore , with the parameters of our choice , there is a possibility to explain all the icecube events in the energy region of @xmath224 in the present scenario .",
    "it should be , however , noted that the optical depth @xmath57 is very sensitive to @xmath133 and @xmath123 in the parameter region near the sample point 2 .",
    "therefore , the shape of the present neutrino flux strongly depends on these parameters . requiring that the flux obeys a power law of @xmath225 in the energy region of @xmath226 , for example",
    ", @xmath126 should be tuned with the accuracy of @xmath227 assuming that @xmath228 .",
    "we emphasize here that , in order to realize the @xmath218 power law , the neutrino scattering processes should become efficient , which predicts sizable @xmath136 ( or @xmath56 ) . in the sample point 2 , for example ,",
    "@xmath229 ( and @xmath230 ) .",
    "such a value of the @xmath136 parameter is close to or within the reach of the expected sensitivity of the pixie and the prism experiments .",
    "hence if the icecube events in the energy region of @xmath224 are explained in the present scenario , the future experiments may have a chance to see the cmb spectral distortion .    here",
    ", we also point out that in order to explain the icecube events in the present scenario , @xmath84 can not be arbitrary large .",
    "we found that , for @xmath231 , the flux of @xmath232 can not be obtained without conflicting the current observational constraints .",
    "thus the mass of @xmath4 responsible for the icecube events should be smaller than @xmath233 .    finally , we comment on the angular dependence of the neutrino flux . in the early - decay scenario ,",
    "the neutrino flux is isotropic , which is consistent with the icecube result . on the contrary",
    ", it has also been discussed that the decay of dark matter may explain the icecube events @xcite .",
    "in such a scenario , the galactic contribution dominates and large fraction of the energetic neutrinos is expected to come from the direction of the galactic center . denoting the angle between the galactic center and the direction of the neutrino as @xmath31 , the flux from @xmath234 is roughly twice as large as that from @xmath235 at the peak of the flux @xcite .",
    "future observations on the angular dependence may help to distinguish the scenarios with @xmath236 and the ones with @xmath237 .",
    "in this paper , we have studied the cosmological implications of high - energy neutrino injection from the decay of a massive particle @xmath4 .",
    "when considering high - energy neutrinos in the early universe , the scattering processes with background neutrinos are important .",
    "we have numerically followed the evolution of the high - energy neutrino flux including such neutrino scattering effects , and calculate the present neutrino flux .",
    "importantly , even only via the weak interaction , energetic neutrinos with @xmath238 can effectively scatter off background neutrinos at @xmath239 .",
    "such scattering processes affect the shape of the cosmic - ray neutrino spectrum , as well as produce cmb distortions by the emission of photons and charged particles .",
    "we have derived the upper bounds on the yield variable @xmath180 as a function of the energy @xmath84 of the neutrino emitted from the @xmath4 decay and @xmath240 , using observational bounds on the high - energy cosmic - ray neutrino flux and the cmb spectral distortions .",
    "we have seen that the former gives more stringent bound for the case where the neutrino emission occurs when @xmath241 . in particular , for @xmath242 , the neutrino scattering processes are irrelevant , and the upper bound on @xmath180 depends only on the combination of @xmath188 ; in such a case , we found that the bounds are      on the other hand , for @xmath251 , bbn gives a stronger bound . with the current accuracy ,",
    "the cmb bound is less stringent than the bbn bound .",
    "however , with the sensitivity of the future experiments , pixie and prism , for example , the upper bound from cmb observation is expected to be improved by about three orders of magnitude , which will give stronger bound than the bbn .",
    "we have also considered the possibility that the pev neutrino events recently observed by icecube originate from the decay of @xmath4 .",
    "we have seen that the three pev neutrino events ( bert , ernie , and big bird ) can be well explained within this scenario .",
    "in addition , we have seen that , when the decay of @xmath4 occurs at @xmath252 and the initial energy of neutrino produced by the decay of @xmath4 is @xmath253 , we have a possibility to realize an @xmath216 power law neutrino spectrum with a cutoff at @xmath254 pev , which is suggested by the icecube results ; for such a scenario , @xmath126 should be tuned with the accuracy of @xmath255 . in addition , future observation of the cmb may be able to detect the distortion of the cmb spectrum caused by the decay of @xmath4 .",
    "we emphasize here that the mass of @xmath4 responsible for the pev neutrino events can be as large as @xmath256 , if @xmath257 ( which corresponds to @xmath258 ) .",
    "in other words , the icecube experiment can probe the physics at the energy scale much higher than pev .",
    "one of the examples of the new physics containing the candidate of the massive particle @xmath4 is the model with peccei - quinn symmetry @xcite because the natural scale of the peccei - quinn symmetry breaking is @xmath259 .",
    "another possibility can be a messenger sector in gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking model @xcite .",
    "more discussion about particle - physics models with the candidates of the massive particle @xmath4 is found , for example , in @xcite .",
    "therefore , the future icecube experiment can shed light not only on astrophysical sources of cosmic - ray neutrinos , but also on high - energy particle - physics .    _ acknowledgements _ : one of the authors ( t.m . ) is grateful to the mainz institute for theoretical physics ( mitp ) for its hospitality and its partial support during the completion of this work . r.j",
