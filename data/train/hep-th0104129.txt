    "the idea of superspace enlarges the spacetime points labelled by the coordinates @xmath0 by adding two plus two anticommuting grassmannian coordinates @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the spinor indices ) .",
    "thus the coordinates on superspace are @xmath5 and for brevity we introduce @xmath6 .",
    "ordinary anticommuting coordinates @xmath7 are abstract grassmannian numbers .",
    "nevertheless the following question should be asked : can the grassmannian coordinates have some physical meaning  ? in this paper",
    "i would like to show that a physical meaning can be given in terms of an indefiniteness inherent at every point of spacetime .",
    "what kind of indefiniteness can be incorporated in spacetime ?",
    "we assume that such an indeterminacy can appear in quantum gravity on the level of the spacetime foam .",
    "the notion of the spacetime foam was introduced by wheeler for describing the possible complex structure of spacetime on the planck scale @xcite .",
    "it is postulated that the spacetime foam is a cloud of quantum wormholes with a typical linear size of the planck length .",
    "schematically in some rough approximation we can imagine the appearing / disappearing of quantum wormholes as pasting together two points with a subsequent break ( see , fig.[fig1 ] ) . in our approach",
    "we deliberately neglect the following information  : * _ whether two points @xmath8 and @xmath0 are connected by a quantum wormhole or not . _ *    in such an approximation we have an indeterminacy for each spacetime point .",
    "we can say that in this approximation the spacetime foam in quantum gravity is described in some effective manner  : quantum minimalist wormholes are approximated as an indefiniteness inherent in every spacetime point .",
    "our assumption is that grassmannian coordinate @xmath7 describes the indefiniteness ( the loss of information ) of our knowledge about two points @xmath0 and @xmath8  : we do not know if these points are connected by a quantum minimalist wormhole or not ( see , fig.[fig3 ] ) @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the designation for the identification procedure ; @xmath11 ; @xmath12 ; @xmath13 are the pauli matrices ; @xmath14 are the matrix indices ; @xmath15 is the spacetime index ; @xmath16 is the space index @xmath17    such an interpretation of @xmath7 is similar to the interpretation of spin : in certain situations we do not know the value of the @xmath18  projection of spin @xmath19 or @xmath20 . in pauli s words spin is `` a non - classical two - valuedness '' or in the context of this paper it is an `` indefiniteness '' ( `` indeterminacy '' ) . in modern terms `` non - classical two - valuedness '' is spin and it can be described only using spinors .",
    "this comparison allows us to postulate that the above - mentioned indeterminacy connected with the spacetime foam ( pasting together / cutting off of points ) can be described using spinors .",
    "let us introduce the scalar product for spinors @xmath21 and @xmath22 as ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath23 for the scalar product should imply @xmath24 but @xmath25 hence @xmath26 this means that @xmath27 _",
    "i.e. _ the components of a spinor describing the above - mentioned indefiniteness are anticommuting grassmannian numbers .",
    "these arguments allow us to say that * _ the indefiniteness can be described using anticommuting grassmannian coordinates .",
    "in this subsection i would like to remind some definitions from ref .",
    "let us define an operator @xmath28 : it is an operator which identifies two points @xmath29 and @xmath30 or another words this operator creates a minimalist wormhole ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "it makes no sense to identify these points @xmath31 twice , therefore we have the following property @xmath32 let us introduce weyl fermion @xmath33 with the standard anticommuting relations @xmath34",

    "@xcite we have the following relation between minimalist wormhole and weyl fermion @xmath35 let us introduce an operator @xmath36 which moves a mouth of a wormhole from point @xmath29 to point @xmath37 @xmath38      in this subsection i would like to connect a modification of the operators @xmath28 and @xmath39 introduced by smolin with the grassmanian coordinates .",
    "let we have an operator @xmath40 describing a quantum state in which the space with two points @xmath29 and @xmath30 fluctuates between two possibilities : points @xmath31 * either * identified * or * not .",
    "let the operator @xmath40 like to the previous smolin s definition ) has the following property @xmath41 we should note that    * we do not here define the indices @xmath42 ; * @xmath43 and the matrixes @xmath44 we will define later .    the solution of eq .",
    "we search in the form @xmath45 from eq s and we have @xmath46 this equation has the following two simplest solution .",
    "the first is @xmath47 it means that @xmath48 is an undotted spinor of @xmath49 representation of sl(2,*c * ) group . @xmath50",
    "the second solution is the same but only with the replacement @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xmath53 in this case @xmath54 is a dotted spinor of @xmath55 representation .",
    "more concretely we have @xmath56 such two - valuedness forces us to introduce both possibilities : @xmath57 .",
    "now we would like to introduce an infinitesimal operator @xmath58 ( like to smolin ) of a displacement of the wormhole mouth @xmath59 here @xmath60 is an infinitesimal grassmannian number .",
    "therefore we have the following equation for the definition of @xmath58 operator @xmath61 this equation has the following solution @xmath62 for the proof , see appendix [ app ] .",
    "after this we can say that @xmath63 are the grassmanian numbers which we should use as some additional coordinates for the description of the above - mentioned indefiniteness inherent at every spacetime point .",
    "such approach can give us an excellent possibility for understanding of geometrical meaning of spin-@xmath64 .",
    "wheeler @xcite has mentioned repeatedly the importance of a geometrical interpretation of spin-@xmath64 .",
    "he wrote : _ the geometrical description of @xmath64-spin must be a significant component of any electron model _ ! in this connection it should be note that friedman and sorkin @xcite for the first time have shown that the three manifold with non - trivial topology can have the quantum states of the gravitational field with half integral angular momentum .",
    "in this approach * superspace is an effective model of the spacetime foam , _",
    "i.e. _ some approximation in quantum gravity*. the indefiniteness connected with the creation / annihilation of quantum minimalist wormholes is described by grassmannian coordinates ( see , fig.[fig3 ] ) . in this interpretation",
    "an infinitesimal grassmannian coordinate transformation is associated with a displacement of the wormhole mouth , _ i.e. _ with a change of the identification procedure ( see , fig.[fig4 ] ) @xmath65 here the identification procedure @xmath66 is described by the operator @xmath67 . in this case",
    "the grassmannian coordinate transformation has a very clear geometrical sense : it describes a displacement of the wormhole mouth or it is the change of the identification prescription .",
    "it is necessary to note that in ref .",
    "@xcite there is a similar interpretation of the grassmanian ghosts : they are the jacobi fields which are the infinitesimal displacement between two classical trajectories",
    ".    in this geometrical approach supersymmetry means that a supersymmetrical lagrangian is invariant under the identification procedure , _",
    "i.e. _ * _ the corresponding supersymmetrical fields must be described in an invariant manner on the background of the spacetime foam . _ *",
    "i am very grateful for doug singleton and richard livine for the comments and fruitful discussion .",
    "for the proof of eq .",
    "we shall calculate an effect of the @xmath69 operator on the @xmath70 operator . on the one hand we have @xmath71 here @xmath72 . on the other hand @xmath73 where @xmath74 therefore we have @xmath75 it means that the operator @xmath76 with the shifted wormhole mouth is equivalent to the change of the grassmanian coordinate @xmath77 ."
