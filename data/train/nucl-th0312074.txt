    "electromagnetic form factors have played a crucial role in understanding the structure of composite particles .",
    "a particularly important composite particle is the nucleon , which forms the basis upon which all matter is built .",
    "studies of the structure of the nucleon with electromagnetic probes begun in the late 50 s and early 60 s when hofstadter and collaborators demonstrated that the nucleon was not point - like with a ( proton ) root - mean square radius @xmath6 fm . in the 1970",
    "s many experiments were performed , showing that the neutron was a complex particle with a negative r.m.s .",
    "radius and @xmath7 ( gev / c)@xmath8 in 1973 , it was suggested that the nucleon has a two component structure with an intrinsic part with form factor @xmath9 and a meson cloud parametrized in terms of vector mesons , @xmath10 . in the late 1970 s",
    "the non - relativistic quark - model was used to describe the properties of hadrons .",
    "it was soon realized that this model can not describe form factors in a consistent way .",
    "also in the late 1970 s , qcd emerged as the theory of strong interactions . in a perturbative approach , p - qcd ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the form factors can be derived , yielding the large @xmath11 behavior of the nucleon form factors to be @xmath12 .  in the 1980 s",
    ", experimental groups noted that all form factors , except @xmath13 , could be described by the empirical dipole form @xmath14 these observations culminated in the slac experiment ne11 on the ratio @xmath15  that appeared to be consistent with scaling up to @xmath16 ( gev / c)@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "however , in 2000 - 2002 experiments performed at tjnaf @xcite , @xcite using the recoil polarization method have shown the astounding result that the ratio of proton electric to proton magnetic form factor decreases dramatically with @xmath17 inconsistent with scaling . in the first part of this article , the present situation on electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon in the space - like region will be reviewed .",
    "for relativistic systems , one has access to the time - like part of the form factors .",
    "studies of this part begun in the late 60 s and early 70 s through processes @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the first positive result on the time - like form factors of the proton was obtained in 1972 at  frascati @xcite .",
    "several other experiments where subsequently performed culminating in the fermilab experiment e835 @xcite . in 1998",
    "the first measurement of the neutron time - like form factor was reported @xcite .",
    "this measurement appeared to be in disagreement with simple quark model extensions to large @xmath11 , where @xmath20 . in the second part of this article ,",
    "the present situation on the time - like electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon will be reviewed .",
    "two basic principles play a crucial role in the analysis of electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon .",
    "the first of these is relativistic invariance .",
    "this principle fixes the form of the nucleon current to be @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the so - called dirac and pauli form factors and @xmath24 is the anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "this symmetry is expected to be exact .",
    "the second is isospin invariance .",
    "although this symmetry is not exact , being of dynamical origin , it is expected to be only slightly broken in a realistic theory of strong interaction .",
    "isospin invariance leads to the introduction of isoscalar , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and isovector , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , form factors , and hence to relations among proton and neutron form factors .",
    "the observed sachs form factors , @xmath29 and @xmath30 can be obtained by the relations @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "these relations also satisfy another constraint , namely the kinematical constraint @xmath33 this constraint is of crucial importance in the time - like region , while playing a minor role in the space - like region .",
    "different models of the nucleon correspond to different assumptions for the dirac and pauli form factors . in 1973",
    "@xcite a model of the nucleon in which the external photon couples to both an intrinsic structure , described by the form factor @xmath9 , and a meson cloud , treated within the framework of vector meson ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 ) dominance , was suggested . in this model",
    "the dirac and pauli form factors are parametrized as @xmath36 \\\\",
    "f_{1}^{v}(q^{2 } ) & = & \\frac{1}{2}g(q^{2})[(1-\\beta _ { \\rho } )",

    "the best fit was obtained for @xmath37 .",
    "this form will be used in the remaining part of this talk . before comparing with the data ,",
    "an additional modification is needed . in view of the fact that the @xmath38 meson has a non - negligible width",
    ", one needs to replace @xmath39 where @xmath40 ^{1/2}\\ln \\left ( \\frac{\\sqrt{4m_{\\pi } ^{2}+q^{2}}+\\sqrt{q^{2}}}{2m_{\\pi } } \\right ) . \\ ] ]    this replacement is important for small @xmath11 , although , because of the logarithm dependence of the @xmath41 cut expressed by the function @xmath42 , its effect is felt even at moderate and large @xmath11 .      by using the coupling constants given in table 1 of @xcite @xmath43 an intrinsic form factor with @xmath44 ( gev / c)@xmath45 , standard values of the masses ( @xmath46 gev@xmath47 gev@xmath48 gev ) , and a @xmath38 width @xmath49 gev , one can calculate the ratio @xmath50 .",
    "the result is shown against the new data @xcite , @xcite in fig.1 .",
    "the agreement is astonishing .",

    "the nucleon has both an intrinsic structure ( presumably three valence quarks ) and additional contributions ( presumably @xmath56 pairs ) .",
    "( the complex nature of the nucleon resulting from electromagnetic form factors is in accord with results obtained by the @xmath57 collaboration @xcite , where the additional , non @xmath58 , components were attributed to gluons . )",
    "an estimate of the spatial extent of the intrinsic region ( where the fundamental quarks sit ) can be obtained from the value of @xmath59 in the intrinsic form factor . the r.m.s . of this distribution",
    "is @xmath2 fm , much smaller that the proton r.m.s",
    ". radius @xmath60 fm .",
    "the zero in the _ electric _ form factor is a consequence of the two term structure of eq.(2 ) , in particular of the fact that the second term is multiplied by @xmath61 any model with a two term structure will produce results in qualitative agreement with data . indeed",
    "three of the descriptions considered in @xcite , a soliton model @xcite , and two relativistic constituent quark models @xcite , @xcite have this structure and produce results in qualitative agreement with experiment .",
    "also the introduction of relativity in non - relativistic quark models goes in the direction of reducing the ratio @xcite . to discriminate between various models",
    "it is necessary to find precisely at which value",
    "the zero occurs .",
    "the agreement between theory and data for the proton form factors is not limited to the ratio @xmath62 consider the magnetic form factor , @xmath63 .",
    "for convenience of display , normalize it to the so - called dipole form factor , @xmath64 .",
    "the data @xcite , @xcite , @xcite in the interval @xmath65 ( gev / c)@xmath1 are plotted in fig.2 .",
    "they show an ondulation , crossing the value one at @xmath66 ( gev / c)@xmath1 and again at @xmath67 ( gev / c)@xmath1 .",
    "the calculation is in excellent agreement with the data , with crossing points at precisely the same values @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( gev / c)@xmath1 .",
    "the observed ondulation is proof that vector meson ( with masses @xmath70 ( gev / c)@xmath1 ) components are important . without @xmath38 meson component , the form factor should behave smoothly ( see fig .",

    "however , the situation here appears to be similar to the situation for the proton form factors previous to the experiments of jones et al @xcite and gayou et al @xcite .",
    "i consider first the region @xmath73 ( gev / c)@xmath1 .",
    "an analysis ( 2001 ) of recent experiments by j. golak et al @xcite and by h. anklin et al @xcite shows that the new data for @xmath74 points to an ondulation with crossing point at @xmath68 ( gev / c)@xmath1 as predicted by isospin invariance , and eq.(2 ) .",
