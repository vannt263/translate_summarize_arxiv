    "a set of ccsn nucleosynthesis models is calculated from a progenitor @xmath1 , @xmath2 star ( * ? ? ? * p13 hereafter ) . the simulation of the ccsn explosion includes the fallback prescription by @xcite ( model 25d ) .",
    "the initial shock velocity beyond fallback is @xmath3 , which corresponds to a total explosion energy of @xmath4 . after the end of the central c burning ,",
    "the convective he shell becomes unstable and eventually h from above the shell is ingested into the he - rich region .",
    "the onset of core o burning completely deactivates the convective shell until the sn explosion , leaving he - rich shell material with about 1.2% of h. the occurrence of mergers between different stellar zones in massive stars is known from the literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for h mixed into the he shell ) , but its effect on pre- and post - explosive nucleosynthesis has never been investigated before .",
    "the ingestion of h into hotter layers needs to be simulated with multi - dimensional hydrodynamics because one - dimensional hydrostatic models lose their predictive power @xcite . in the absence of realistic 3d - hydrodynamics simulations , a qualitative analysis of the effect of residual h during explosive he burning",

    "together with model 25d from p13 we consider five new models : 25d - h5 , 25d - h10 , 25d - h20 , 25d - h50 and 25d - h500 ( models set d ) .",
    "these models share the structure and ccsn explosion of 25d , but the amount of h in the he shell is reduced by a factor of 5 , 10 , 20 50 and 500 respectively compared to model 25d . in p13 , the ccsn model with the most extreme conditions is the @xmath5 , @xmath2 model , with @xmath6 sn explosion . the bottom of the c - rich c / si zone reaches a peak temperature 3.3 times higher than that in the 25d model ( 2.3@xmath710@xmath8 compared to 0.7@xmath710@xmath8 ) .",

    "the 25t - h model produces the lowest / ratios , due to large contributions from radiogenic from ( fig.[fig : abundances_models ] ) .",

    "the 25d and 25d - h5 models show ratios lower than observed , and dilution with normal material is needed .",
    "most of graphites show the well - known signature of n isotopic equilibration or contamination @xcite . our predictions for c and n ratios might also provide a solution for mainstream sic grains with /@xmath19100 , not reproduced from low - mass asymptotic giant branch star models @xcite . whether these grains could have condensed from sn ejecta needs to be explored .    in fig.[fig",

    "therefore , c - rich mixtures from the c / si , o / nova , and he / c zones of the models 25t - h , 25t - h5 , and 25t - h10 can potentially reproduce for the fist time the highest / ratios observed in sic - x and ld - graphite grains , consistently with the observed / ratio . in the upper - right panel",

    "* ) , which does not include h - ingestion and has ccsn conditions similar to those of the 25 t models (  [ sec : models_description ] ) . as discussed in @xcite , in the most -rich layers",
    "there is negligible amount of oxygen left and minor mixing with normal material can yield a close - to - normal o isotopic composition .",
    "the effect of the h ingestion is to destroy and increase , moving the theoretical curves for the he / c zone from the lower - right quadrant to the upper - right .",
    "unfortunately , a large fraction of graphites show o isotopic equilibration or contamination , in particular for graphites with the lowest / ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , making a meaningful comparison between grain data and models difficult .",
    "the 25d models seem to be more compatible with sic - ab grains ( fig.[fig : iso_grains ] ) . in fig.[fig : al26_o18_deltasi29 ] , lower panels , we compare isotopic ratios of ab and nova sic grains with theoretical curves for 25d models .",
    "ab grains with / lower than solar are on average more -rich . a nova grain and",
    "the ab grains with the highest enrichment are compatible with our models , while most of them require some dilution with material of close - to - normal composition .",
    "this is consistent with an observed trend of / inversely proportional to the al abundance .",
    "theoretical predictions for / and / ( not shown in the figure ) and c isotopic ratios seem to be consistent with ab and nova grains .",
    "previously applied sn mixing schemes considered matter from the he / n zone to account for low / together with high / in sn grains ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , in contrast to our 25 t and 25d models , those calculations do not provide in sufficient quantities .",
    "the possibility of having large concentrations of , and in the he / c zone makes it easier to fit the observed ratios within the constraint of a c - rich mixture in mixing models .",
    "the peculiar isotopic abundances discussed in the previous sections are relevant for galactic chemical evolution ( gce ) . while presolar sn grains found in meteorites only condensed from ccsne that exploded at most several hundred million years before the formation of the sun @xcite , h - ingestion events in the he shell are expected to happen more frequently in low - metallicity stars .",
    "about 15% of sic - x grains and 53% of ld graphite grains show lower than solar c isotopic ratios ( see presolar grain database ) .",
    "therefore , we could argue that at least 15 - 50% of the he - shell material ejected from ccsne was exposed to h ingestion .",
    "we explored the impact of h ingestion on the nitrogen inventory in the galaxy .",
    "intermediate - mass stars can largely account for the nitrogen abundance in the solar system ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "spectroscopic observations , on the other hand , have shown that massive stars are the most important suppliers of primary nitrogen in the early galaxy @xcite .",
    "recent gce models underestimate the abundance of in the sun by more than a factor of four @xcite .",
    "models of fast rotating massive stars can explain the observed production of primary @xcite , but not the missing @xcite . this contrasts with observations of low / ratios at high redshift , which suggests a massive star origin for ( @xmath21n/@xmath22n=@xmath23 at z=0.89 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while novae are a controversial source of at much later timescales @xcite .",
    "we tested this scenario using the gce model presented in @xcite , constructed with the gce code getool @xcite .",
    "we assume that the yields of all ccsne with initial mass @xmath24 carry the n isotopic ratio of model 25t - h ( /=20 ) , and apply the prediction of model 25d for stars with initial mass @xmath25 ( /=434 ) .",
    "since n is a primary product of h ingestion and is not affected by the initial metallicity of the star , we used the same solar yields for ccsne of all metallicities .",
    "the gce of the n isotopic ratio is shown in fig.[fig : n_ratio_gce ] , in comparison with the baseline case . with the extreme assumptions mentioned above",
    ", we obtain an n isotopic ratio more than four times _ lower _ than in the sun .",
    "furthermore , our large production of and in the he shell of ccsne changes the gce results at low metallicities .",
    "we can not rigorously quantify the impact of stellar yield uncertainties and gce uncertainties in fig.[fig : n_ratio_gce ] due , in part , to the limitations of current stellar models .",
    "therefore , these results are meant to be illustrative rather than definitive .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations of h - ingestion in massive stars are needed to produce more robust stellar yields to quantify the role that these events play in providing a source of nitrogen , and in particular of , throughout the galaxy .",
    "major effects can also be expected for other isotopes , above all .",
    "we presented new explosive nucleosynthesis calculations for the he shell in ccsne of massive stars .",
    "the main goal of this work is to study the nucleosythesis impact of the possible presence of h in the he shell , due to h ingestion before the sn shock reaches these layers .",
    "we explore a large range of explosion conditions ( a factor of 3.3 change in the peak temperature of the sn shock , and a factor of 100 in the peak density ) , and of the h abundance ( 0.002%@xmath19x@xmath26@xmath191.2% ) with simplistic 1d sn simulations .",
    "our calculations have identified the ccsn conditions to explain puzzling signatures in c - rich presolar grains .",
    "although comparisons of these conditions to the observations can be used to constrain the nature of the supernova explosion , quantitative results require more detailed calculations .",
    "for example , the multidimensional structure generated by the h - ingestion can not be properly represented by 1d - hydrostatic models .",
    "the yield results are sensitive to the peak density and temperature and 3d - hydrodynamics simulations of the h ingestion are needed to quantitatively predict this pre - shock structure . with such detailed models , the features in the c - rich grains can be used to constrain the nature of the ccsn explosion and of sn - shock propagation producing these yields ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we explored the impact of our models on the gce of the n isotopic ratio , showing that h ingestion in massive stars can be an important source of and in particular of , affecting the solar n isotopic ratio .",
    "to investigate this idea in more detail , massive star simulations with mixing assumptions that allow h - ingestion events are needed .",
