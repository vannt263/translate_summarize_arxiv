    "ultracold atoms in the optical lattice ( ol ) have been eagerly studied since the experimental realization of bose - einstein condensates@xcite and quantum degenerate fermi gases@xcite .",
    "their high controllability and visibility render the systems suitable for the investigation of quantum vortices@xcite , force detector@xcite , quantum simulator@xcite , artificial gauge field@xcite , and so on . in particular ,",
    "a great deal of attention has been drawn to the bose-(fermi-)hubbard model@xcite , which revealed a plethora of novel quantum phases in relatively deep ol potentials .",
    "in contrast , the dynamics of ultracold atoms in rather shallow ols may be investigated by analogy to the electrons in crystals .",
    "the energy band structure , namely a general consequence of the periodic potential , naturally plays an important role in coherent manipulation of the matter waves .",
    "pulse - like modulation of the ol amplitude allows us to selectively excite subsets of atoms in specific quasimomentum states .",
    "bloch oscillations@xcite and landau - zener ( lz hereafter ) transitions  @xcite were observed in the past in ultracold atomic systems in ol in the presence of a constant force .",
    "these facts suggest that interferometric techniques for splitting and recombining the wave packets are feasible .",
    "recently , there is a revival of interest in atoms in the combined potential of the parabolic potential and the optical lattice ( parabolic ol hereafter )",
    ". one interesting feature of the system is that some of the eigenstates are spatially localized far away from the center of the parabolic potential@xcite .",
    "it is suggested that this kind of spatially localized eigenstates ( referred to sles ) be used and controlled as quantum registers@xcite with precision .",
    "the recent bec experiment done in aarhus achieved an efficient population transfer of atoms to localized states and a wave packet manipulation in the following way@xcite .",
    "first , excite bec by lattice amplitude modulation and thus create wave packets in a higher energy band .",
    "and then after a few milliseconds of free propagation , de - excite the atoms by another amplitude modulation at such a timing that the final wave packet is concentrated in a spatial region where the trap and ol are energetically balanced .",
    "the following two conditions are necessary for a large population transfer to occur , be it excitation or de - excitation , namely a large spatial overlap and the energy conservation , of which the latter means the equality of the modulation frequency and the energy difference between the initial and final states ( divided by @xmath1 ) .",
    "the aarhus group inferred the motion of the wave packet using a simple semiclassical method@xcite and neglecting the atom - atom interaction .",
    "their estimates agreed qualitatively but not quantitatively with the experimental results .",
    "moreover , when the net excitation energy exceeds the height of the optical lattice , there is no satisfactory theoretical analysis .",
    "this work is motivated by this current situation .",
    "we focus on the excitation followed by the free wave packet propagation since this sequence contains the gist of the aarhus experiment .",
    "importantly , we use parameter values drawn from the actual experiment . in doing so , we consider non - interacting bosonic systems in a one - dimensional parabolic ol , and reveal how the amplitude modulation pulse affects futures of the band population as a function of time .",
    "most importantly , it must be stated that the spatial variation of the parabolic trap is so gentle and slow in comparison to the spatial oscillations of the ol that the trap affects the periodicity of the ol very adiabatically .",
    "the energy band structure thus plays a crucial role .",
    "a most enlightening result of our investigation is that a simple rabi model adapted to the bloch energy band structure applies ; its reliability is unexpectedly high .",
    "this suggests that the amplitude modulation may be treated in analogy with radiation fields , thus known techniques in quantum optics are applicable except for a slight difference in selection rules .",
    "we shall treat the amplitude modulation of the ol as if it were the `` _ radiation field _ '' .    in order to interpret our numerical results , we found it effective to extend the semiclassical theory originally applied to the wave packet motion of fermions in a parabolic ol in ref .",
    "such theory gives a useful guideline and language for understanding the dynamics if somewhat imperfect .",
    "in the aarhus experiment , the excited wave packet gets accelerated under the influence of the parabolic potential .",
    "this fact leads , on the one hand , to the high order bragg diffraction and , on the other , to the landau - zener transition at band gaps . to digress on the second of these two effects",
    ", the energy gap between two neighboring bands generally decreases with increasing band index .",
    "when the band gap becomes negligibly small , the lz transition rate reaches 100% .",
    "however , in the parameter regime of the actually conducted experiments , the lz transition rate departs from this limiting value .",
    "we employ the simple semiclassical theory to estimate the high - order bragg diffraction and the lz transition in sect .",
    "[ ss : bloch - lz ] .",
    "it is well - known that the atom - atom interaction , represented as the nonlinear term in the gross - pitaevskii equation , plays an important role in ultracold bosonic systems .",
    "however , the experimental results of aarhus@xcite show that the nonlinear term affects the major dynamics of the wave packet in a rather insignificant manner . and , the wave packet dynamics shows very complicated features even in the linear case because the parabolic potential modifies the usual bloch band picture .",
    "hence , it would make sense to analyze complexities due to nonlinearity in reference to the linear case .",
    "the ideal single - particle treatment carried out here is intended to give a good starting point for analyzing experiments with a variable interaction strength@xcite .",
    "this paper thus focuses on the linear system foregoing the examination of nonlinear effects , a future endeavor .",
    "incidentally , the atom - atom interaction could be tuned to 0 anyhow by adjusting the fano - feshbach resonance position by an external magnetic field@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ sect : system ] outlines the system and its theoretical model , and gives some additional background about the experiment .",
    "[ sect : numerics ] discusses the numerical results of the population transfer with single and two - color excitation .",
    "[ sect : subsequent ] discusses the analysis of the dynamics of the wave packet after the excitation process .",
    "[ sect : conclusions ] concludes the paper .",
    "this paper uses recoil energy @xmath2 for the unit of energy , recoil momentum @xmath3 for the unit of ( quasi-)momentum , lattice constant @xmath4 for the unit of length and rescaled time @xmath5 for the unit of time . here",
    "@xmath1 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 correspond to the planck constant , wave length of the optical lattice , and mass of the particle , respectively .",
    "experimental creation and detection of wave packets@xcite consists principally of three independent manipulations , namely initial state preparation , excitation or deexcitation with amplitude modulation , and free propagation on top of either band - mapping or _ in situ _ observation .",
    "the time - dependence of the hamiltonian derives solely from the amplitude modulation , so that the preparation and free propagation of a wave packet require the knowledge of the static eigenstates .",
    "thus , we begin with the description of a mathematical model system based on the combined potential of a parabolic trap and an optical lattice to exhibit main characteristics of the system@xcite .",
    "these theoretical features correspond closely to experimentally detected wave packets .",
    "the experimental procedures will be thus presented in the second half , sect .",
    "[ ss : experiment ] for making our theoretical motivation clear .",
    "the general hamiltonian reads @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the height of the optical lattice and the frequency of the parabolic potential , respectively . in this paper , we consider the following rescaled hamiltonian @xmath11 where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 denote the rescaled position @xmath15 , the rescaled optical lattice height @xmath16 , and the rescaled parabolic trap strength @xmath17 , respectively with @xmath18 .",
    "please keep in mind that in figures to be shown later , the zero of the energy is set conveniently to the minimum eigenenergy in each case .",
    "let us remark in passing , several groups are working on the wave packet creation and detection ; their experimental parameter values are rather similar@xcite .",
    "all the values in this paper are set equal to those of the aarhus experiment@xcite .",
    "the hamburg group s values are also shown for reference.(see table [ table : parameter ] . )",
    ".typical values of the parameters for aarhus@xcite and hamburg@xcite experiments .",
    "parameters converted for numerical analysis are also shown .",
    "( the hamburg group varies @xmath10 and s , so that only their representative values are shown . ) [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table : lz - pop ]",
    "in this paper , we investigated dynamics of ultracold bosonic atoms in a parabolic ol system .",
    "one purpose is to numerically produce coherent matter wave packets , and the other is to study their subsequent evolution in time . the production is experimentally effected by modulating the amplitude of the optical lattice , thus exciting the atoms coherently , and then halting its modulation for a certain period of time .",
    "the experiment then lets the wave packets propagate freely in time .",
    "we analyzed the time dependence of the band population during the production of wave packets , and found that the current experimental laser intensity is in the so - called strongly - coupled regime with atoms in an optical lattice . using the language of quantum optics",
    ", we introduced the single - q rabi model to account for the bloch band population .",
    "simple calculations indeed showed good agreement with rigorous numerical calculations .",
    "we also considered the two - color excitation procedure in a most straightforward way imaginable , and observed indeed enhancement in wave packet production .",
    "energy band structures caused by the periodic optical lattice potential lead to band gaps . here two interesting phenomena of the lz transition and bragg reflection occur simultaneously .",
    "the well - known semiclassical formula for the lz transition probability is verified in this work to yield reasonable estimates for the lz process .",
    "thus the combined effects of the bragg reflection and the lz transition lead to a seemingly complicated time - evolution of the wave packet . such complex manifestation of wave packets suggest paradoxically that a suitable control of the optical lattice parameters may enable us to manipulate matter waves at will .    the motivated task of this paper is thus complete . for possible future directions , investigation of the access and",
    "the life time of sles@xcite comes immediately to our minds . from the theoretical viewpoint",
    ", one needs to consider both encoding and decoding of information together .",
    "these two tasks should proceed in tandem to check if purported aims may be fulfilled .",
    "the interesting issue is the effect of non - linear term because it modifies the bloch band picture , _",
    "e.g. _ the lz transition probability shows asymmetric features between lowest and 1st excited band@xcite . the parabolic ol system will be a good example for investigating the asymmetric lz transition in higher band with position dependent acceleration .",
    "also the features of soliton solution may be investigated with the system .",
    "in addition to the nonlinearity , the dimensionality is an interesting issue as well . in the present work ,",
    "the analysis works very well with a quasi-1d system , _",
    "i.e. _ the tight confinement in all but the direction of the ol",
    ". however , there is no guarantee that it works well in the case of a realistic 3d system .",
    "moreover , to analyze the real experiments , the experimental initial conditions need to be recreated .",
    "this knowledge is currently incomplete , so that theoretically simulating various initial states may yield valuable information .",
    "the parabolic ol system is said to have a wide variety of applications , not limited to registering quantum information . in the case of fermionic atoms ,",
    "the amplitude modulation can create a particle - hole pair in analogy with photoconductivity  @xcite . in the hamburg experiment  @xcite , a variation in particle - hole recombination rate",
    "was observed as a function of the scattering length .",
    "numerous other manifestations of the atom - atom interactions can be expected in the current experimental setup .",
    "much to be explored on the basis of the insights gained from the present linear system .",
