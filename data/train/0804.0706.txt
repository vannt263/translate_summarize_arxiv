    "in  @xcite matveev defined for any compact 3-manifold @xmath1 a non - negative integer @xmath10 , which he called the _ complexity _ of @xmath1 .",
    "the complexity function @xmath11 has the following remarkable properties : it is additive under connected sum , it does not increase when cutting along incompressible surfaces , and it is finite - to - one on the most interesting classes of 3-manifolds .",
    "namely , among the compact 3-manifolds having complexity @xmath11 there is only a finite number of closed @xmath12-irreducible  ones and a finite number of finite - volume hyperbolic ones ( with cusps and/or with compact geodesic boundary ) .",
    "the complexity of a closed @xmath12-irreducible  3-manifold is then precisely the minimal number of tetrahedra needed to triangulate it , except when its complexity is @xmath13 , _",
    "i.e. _  when it is @xmath14 , @xmath15 or @xmath16 .    the problem of computing ( or at least estimating ) the complexity of @xmath1 naturally arose .",
    "for the closed case , martelli and petronio developed a theory of decomposition of closed @xmath12-irreducible  3-manifolds  @xcite .",
    "the decomposition is made along tori and klein bottles ( as in the jsj decomposition ) in such a way that the complexity of the original manifold is the sum of the ( suitably defined ) complexities of the building blocks ( called bricks ) .",
    "the bricks carry an extra structure given by a finite set of trivalent graphs , each contained in a boundary component so that the complement is a disc .",
    "these graphs are fundamental because they affect both the definition of the complexity of bricks and the reassembling of bricks .",
    "this theory seems to be very useful for the computation / estimation process .",
    "martelli and petronio  @xcite used the orientable version of it to list closed irreducible orientable 3-manifolds of complexity up to 9 , and then martelli  @xcite used it to get the list up to complexity 10 .",
    "moreover , in  @xcite , martelli and petronio gave estimations on the complexity of closed 3-manifolds .",
    "there are many reasons making this theory feasible , at least in the orientable case up to complexity 10 : for instance , there are very few bricks with respect to closed manifolds , they must satisfy many topological restrictions ( so the search of bricks is easier than that of closed manifolds ) , they can be assembled ( to produce closed manifolds ) in a finite ( small ) number of ways , and the decomposition into bricks seems to be a refinement of the jsj decomposition ( so it is easy to give a `` name '' to the manifolds obtained by assembling bricks ) .",
    "the main objects of the decomposition theory are the 3-manifolds with marked boundary .",
    "a 3-manifold with marked boundary is a pair @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a compact 3-manifold whose ( possibly empty ) boundary is made up of tori and klein bottles , and @xmath2 is a trivalent graph that is a spine of @xmath3 .",
    "the main tools used in the decomposition to work on 3-manifolds with marked boundary are the standard skeleta .",
    "a standard skeleton of a 3-manifold with marked boundary @xmath0 is a standard sub - polyhedron @xmath4 of @xmath1 such that @xmath5 coincides with @xmath2 and with @xmath6 , and such that @xmath7 is a spine of @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is a ball ) .",
    "we remark that standard skeleta are viewed up to isotopy .",
    "these objects may seem less natural than those used by turaev and viro in  @xcite , _ i.e. _  the standard spines @xmath4 of @xmath1 such that @xmath5 coincides with @xmath2 and with @xmath6 .",
    "however , standard skeleta are very useful when one wants to glue two 3-manifolds with marked boundary along the boundary by identifying the trivalent graphs , because after the gluing the skeleta unite and form a standard skeleton of the manifold with marked boundary obtained . on the contrary , the spines used by turaev and viro would unite and form a spine of the manifold minus a ball .    in this paper",
    ", we will deal with the problem of deciding how different standard skeleta of a 3-manifold with marked boundary are related to each other .",
    "we will prove that the classical set of moves for standard spines of 3-manifolds ( _ i.e. _  the mp - move and the v - move ) does not suffice to relate to each other any two standard skeleta of a 3-manifold with marked boundary .",
    "the reason is that these moves are very `` local '' , _",
    "i.e. _  the portion of the skeleton involved in the move is contained in a `` small '' ball .",
    "a first solution to this problem is to use the l - move , a generalisation of the v - move .",
    "however , this suffices only for a particular class of 3-manifolds with marked boundary .",
    "we will define an object for each standard skeleton of a 3-manifold with marked boundary that is invariant under mp - moves and l - moves .",
    "this object is the main ingredient for giving a condition on the 3-manifold with marked boundary that tells whether the mp - move and the l - move suffice to relate to each other any two standard skeleta of the 3-manifold with marked boundary .    if @xmath1 has @xmath17 boundary components , an _ octopus _",
    "@xmath18 in @xmath1 is the image ( viewed up to isotopy ) of an embedding of the cone on @xmath17 points such that the preimage of each boundary component of @xmath1 is exactly one endpoint of the cone .",
    "note that any two omotopy equivalent octopuses can be obtained from each other by means of changes of crossings .",
    "instead , a modification of the homotopy type of an octopus needs a more drastic move .",
    "if @xmath4 is a standard skeleton of @xmath0 , we consider the ideal triangulation dual to @xmath7 ; the edges dual to the regions in the boundary components of @xmath1 form an octopus defined unambiguously from @xmath4 .",
    "the main point is that the octopus of @xmath4 is invariant under mp - moves and l - moves",
    ".    we will prove that if in a 3-manifold with marked boundary there is only one octopus , the mp - move and the l - move suffice to relate to each other any two standard skeleta of the 3-manifold with marked boundary .",
    "for the 3-manifolds with marked boundary that do not fulfil this condition , we give three other moves that can change the octopus : the cr - move , the -move and the -move .",
    "they are particular types of the so - called disc replacement moves , which have been defined by matveev ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the first one is `` local '' and allows us to change a crossing of the octopus .",
    "we will prove that if any two octopuses of a 3-manifold with marked boundary can be obtained from each other by changes of crossing , then any two standard skeleta of the manifold can be related to each other by mp - moves , l - moves and cr - moves .",
    "for the universal case , we will use the non - local -moves , which allow us to change the octopuses arbitrarily , and we will prove that the mp - move , the l - move and the -moves suffice to relate to each other any two standard skeleta of a generic 3-manifold with marked boundary .    as a corollary , we will get that disc replacement moves ( indeed , only some of them that we will call disc - replacements ) suffice to relate to each other any two standard skeleta of a 3-manifold with marked boundary .",
    "throughout this paper , @xmath1 will be a fixed compact connected 3-manifold with ( possibly empty ) boundary made up of tori and klein bottles .",
    "we will adopt an `` embedded viewpoint '' , _",

    "<S> a 3-manifold with marked boundary is a pair @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a compact 3-manifold whose ( possibly empty ) boundary is made up of tori and klein bottles , and @xmath2 is a trivalent graph that is a spine of @xmath3 . </S>",

    "<S> , we will prove that the classical set of moves for standard spines of 3-manifolds ( _ i.e. _  the mp - move and the v - move ) does not suffice to relate to each other any two standard skeleta of a 3-manifold with marked boundary . </S>",
    "<S> we will also describe a condition on the 3-manifold with marked boundary that tells whether the generalised set of moves , made up of the mp - move and the l - move , suffices to relate to each other any two standard skeleta of the 3-manifold with marked boundary .    for the 3-manifolds with marked boundary that do not fulfil this condition , we give three other moves : the cr - move , the -move and the -move . </S>",
    "<S> the first one is local and , with the mp - move and the l - move , suffices to relate to each other any two standard skeleta of a 3-manifold with marked boundary fulfilling another condition . for the universal case </S>",
    "<S> , we will prove that the non - local -move and -move , with the mp - move and the l - move , suffice to relate to each other any two standard skeleta of a generic 3-manifold with marked boundary .    as a corollary </S>",
