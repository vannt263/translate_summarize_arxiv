    "the radiative cooling time for the x - ray emitting gas in galaxy clusters is inversely proportional to the gas density , and as the inner regions of galaxy clusters have high electron densities ( @xmath4 @xmath5 ) , the cooling time is short compared to the cluster age ( @xmath6hubble time ) .",
    "however , the signatures of cooling and cold gas predicted due to such short cooling times are in stark contrast with observations in different wavebands ( @xcite ) .",
    "the discrepancy is the so called cooling flow problem ( @xcite ) .",
    "the lack of cooling in cluster cores suggests an efficient energy injection mechanism that offsets cooling losses . some plausible heat sources are jets / bubbles powered by central agn ( active galactic nuclei ",
    "accretion powered supermassive black holes ; for a review , see @xcite ) , thermal conduction from large radii ( e.g. , @xcite ) , heating by dynamical friction and turbulence driven by infalling galaxies and subhalos ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the most promising of these sources is agn jets and bubbles .",
    "observations indicate that the agn blown radio bubbles and x - ray cavities ( @xcite )  indicative of mechanical energy input in central regions of galaxy clusters  have power comparable to the core x - ray luminosity .",
    "although non - feedback sources may be energetically sufficient , the core must be heated by a globally stable mechanism such as agn feedback ( stellar feedback is insufficient ) that can keep up with efficient cooling .",
    "the plasma in the icm is magnetized with the magnetic field strength of order @xmath7 @xmath8 g ( @xcite ) . while the plasma @xmath9 ( the ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure ) is high and the magnetic force on large scales is negligible",
    ", magnetic fields fundamentally alter the transport properties of the icm .",
    "the coulomb mean free path in the core is @xmath10 kpc , @xmath11 to 12 orders of magnitude larger than the proton / electron larmor radius .",
    "particles move and diffuse along the local magnetic field direction .",
    "thus , heat and momentum transport is only along the local magnetic field lines . given that the mean free path is much smaller than the core size ( @xmath6 10 kpc ) , we use braginskii conductivity along magnetic field lines and do not consider the effects of small scale instabilities ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the question of how small scale instabilities affect dynamics and thermodynamics at macroscopic scales is not fully resolved and is subject of intense research ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , the simplest interpretation of the solar wind data suggests that it is fine to use a collisional ( spitzer - hrm ) value of thermal conductivity for scales as big as one - third of the mean free path @xcite .",
    "self - consistent simulations with magnetic fields and anisotropic thermal conduction are especially important given the wide range of theoretical predictions for the effective conductivity of the icm ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "we only consider anisotropic thermal conduction but not anisotropic viscosity ; the viscous diffusion time is @xmath11 times longer than the thermal diffusion timescale ( few 100 myr ) and the viscous effects are expected to be subdominant ( @xcite ) .",
    "see , however , @xcite who emphasized that braginskii viscosity corresponds to a large pressure anisotropy that excites the larmor radius scale mirror and firehose instabilities , and as stressed earlier , their influence on macroscopic scales is theoretically not well understood . as with thermal conduction , we choose the simplest model for the icm viscosity ; namely , we ignore it as it is small .",
    "we emphasize that while the viscosity parallel to field lines is small , the perpendicular viscosity is completely negligible",
    ". therefore , perpendicular velocity is totally unaffected by viscosity , unlike in an isotropic fluid .",
    "anisotropic conduction in the core where the temperature increases with radius leads to a buoyancy instability ( the heat - flux driven buoyancy instability , hbi ; @xcite ) that rearranges magnetic field lines perpendicular to the radial direction , thus shutting off thermal transport to the core from outer radii ( @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to affecting the global thermal properties , anisotropic thermal conduction also affects the local thermal instability in the core . with isotropic thermal conduction , scales smaller than the field length ( scale at which the heat diffusion timescale equals the thermal instability timescale ) do not condense ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , if thermal conduction is anisotropic , thermal instability is not suppressed perpendicular to the field lines and long filaments directed along magnetic field lines , at scales larger than the field length , can condense ( @xcite ; more so if magnetic field lines are tangled or form closed loops ) .    motivated by the observed thermal balance in cluster cores ,",
    "recent hydrodynamic simulations have studied cluster cores in rough thermal balance ( @xcite ) .",
    "these simulations , using different codes and setups , have found that local thermal instability can lead to the formation of multiphase gas only if the ratio of the cooling time ( @xmath12 the thermal instability timescale for a constant heating rate per unit volume ) and the free - fall time ( @xmath13^{1/2}$ ] ; @xmath14 is the acceleration due to gravity ) is smaller than a critical value .",
    "this critical value is @xmath15 for spherical systems such as galaxy clusters .",
    "the observations of extended cold atomic filaments in cluster cores are consistent with this criterion ( fig .",
    "11 in @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the @xmath16 state of the hot gas is expected to provide a rough upper limit on the density of hot gas in halos with different masses ( @xcite ) .",
    "ratio by a factor of two ; given the approximations in our simulations and uncertainties in interpreting x - ray data , however , the existence of a threshold is more important than its precise value . ]",
    "most of the previous work did not include thermal conduction and magnetic fields . given the importance of local thermal instability and a large thermal conductivity in the magnetized icm",
    ", studies of cooling and heating with thermal conduction and magnetic fields are warranted .",
    "we do just this in the present paper .",
    "our main result is that while isotropic thermal conduction at the spitzer value suppresses condensation in the core even when @xmath17 , this criterion is essentially unchanged with the more realistic anisotropic thermal conductivity .",
    "thus , the implications of hydrodynamic models ( @xcite ) should hold for the magnetized plasma in massive dark matter halos .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 is a description of our numerical setup , largely based on @xcite ( hereafter ) but including magnetic fields and thermal conduction . in section 3",
    "we describe our results . in section 4",
    "we discuss the astrophysical implications of our study .",
    "this paper extends the work in by including magnetic fields and thermal conduction ( both isotropic and anisotropic ) . like that work",
    ", the background gravitational potential is given by a static nfw profile ( @xcite ) .",
    "most of our runs use a cluster - mass halo with @xmath18 and @xmath19 kpc ( see eq .",
    "[ 4 ] in ; group and massive cluster runs presented at the end correspond to @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively ) .",
    "the initial conditions consist of the icm in hydrostatic equilibrium but with small ( maximum @xmath22 ) isobaric density perturbations .",
    "the entropy profile of the icm ( following @xcite ; @xmath23 has a core entropy @xmath24 ) is specified as the initial condition . unless specified otherwise , all parameters are identical to .",
    "we use the zeus - mp code ( @xcite ) in spherical geometry for our cluster simulations .",
    "the inner and outer radii for cluster simulations are 1 kpc and 200 kpc , respectively ; for other halos the inner and outer radii are scaled with the halo mass .",
    "outflow boundary conditions are used at the inner radial boundary and reflective boundary conditions are applied at the outer radial boundary .",
    "this outer radial boundary condition is different from and found to be more robust than the inflow boundary condition used there .",
    "outer boundary conditions should not affect the results since the halo gas is in thermal balance and multiphase gas condenses much inside the outer boundary .",
    "reflective ( periodic ) boundary conditions are applied in the meridional ( azimuthal ) direction .",
    "since magnetic field geometry in galaxy clusters is largely unconstrained , we try split - monopole ( @xmath25 ) , azimuthal ( @xmath26 ) , and tangled initial magnetic field geometries .",
    "the tangled ( divergenceless ) magnetic field is generated by taking the curl of a vector potential .",
    "the cartesian components of the vector potential are chosen to have fourier amplitudes @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the absolute value of the wavenumber .",
    "the minimum and maximum wavenumbers in each direction are @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "the fourier components are added with random phases .",
    "the magnitude of the vector potential is smoothly reduced toward poles ( @xmath31 ) and outer radii ( mainly to avoid magnetically dominated regions close to poles that can severely reduce the cfl timestep ; exact form of magnetic field structure should not affect the results ) . the field strength at 1 kpc is chosen to be @xmath32 g , in rough agreement with the observed field strengths .",
    "the radial magnetic field runs are carried out using 2-d axisymmetric simulations with a resolution of @xmath33 .",
    "the tangled magnetic field simulations are carried out in 3-d with a resolution of @xmath34 .",
    "since the results of azimuthal magnetic field simulations are very similar to the simulations without thermal conduction ( as expected and as shown in @xcite ) , we do not discuss them further .",
    "radiative cooling is included using the cooling function in eq .",
    "( 12 ) of @xcite .",
    "observations and simulations with uniformly distributed feedback heating in ( see also jet simulations of @xcite ) suggest that cluster cores reach approximate thermal balance .",
    "therefore , we impose strict thermal balance at all radii using a heating term ( which mimics feedback heating and depends on radius and time ; see eq .",
    "[ 6 ] in ) in every radial shell .",
    "this setup is very idealized , but the model of local thermal instability in global thermal balance captures some of the key features of cool core clusters ; e.g. , no cold gas can condense out of the hot icm if the cooling time is too long compared to the free - fall time . unlike in , heating / cooling due to thermal conduction is included in imposing thermal balance .",
    "( thus , heating term can , in principle , be negative ! however , this is not very common since radiative cooling dominates over conductive heating . )",
    "this heating term corresponds to a constant heating rate per unit volume .",
    "we do not try any other form of the microscopic heating rate because this choice results in @xmath35 and a good match with observations ( see fig .",
    "11 in @xcite ) .",
    "we include thermal conduction , both isotropic and anisotropic ( along local magnetic field direction ) .",
    "the thermal conductivity ( @xmath36 ) is normalized to the spitzer value ( eq .",
    "11 in @xcite ) .",
    "anisotropic thermal conduction along magnetic field lines is implemented explicitly using the method of @xcite .",
    "thermal conduction is implemented via subcycling ; we reduce the local conductivity ( if needed ) such that the number of subcycles at any time is not too high compared to its initial value .",
    "a high number of subcycles means that the conductive time across the grid cell is much shorter than the sound crossing time ; this ordering ( and thus the dynamical significance of conduction ) is maintained even when we locally limit conductivity .",
    "the conduction step becomes prohibitively slow if we do not reduce the local conductivity because very hot plasma is created intermittently when cold gas condenses out .",
    "thermal conduction must be implemented implicitly if we want to perform high resolution simulations with realistic thermal conduction ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; we plan to implement this in future .",

    "our hbi - suppressed value using realistic field strengths and geometries is consistent with @xcite , but clearly shows that agn feedback is necessary to prevent catastrophic cooling in cores .",
    "voit and collaborators ( @xcite ) have argued , by comparing core radius and the field length , that cool core clusters show cold multiphase filaments because field length is smaller than the core radius . while this idea is plausible , it ignores the interplay of local thermal instability and gravity , which suppresses the growth of thermal instability .",

    "field criterion is also not a necessary condition because all scales perpendicular to the local magnetic field direction are locally thermally unstable with anisotropic conduction , and this is evidenced by the lack of influence of anisotropic thermal conduction on the condensation of cold gas from the hot icm ( figs .",

    "it is a coincidence that both @xmath43 and the field criteria give similar core entropy ( @xmath24 ) for cluster mass halos .",
    "comparing multiphase cooling in different halos should help distinguish between these two criteria .",
    "one can also test this physics in other systems where cooling , heating and gravity are key players such as the base of the solar corona .",
    "@xcite has shown that the ratio @xmath43 can become @xmath70 at radii @xmath71 and this ( @xmath72 ) is the scale at which phenomena related to cooling , such as coronal rain are observed ( note that strong coronal magnetic fields play a major role in shaping these structures ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , the field length for the coronal plasma is @xmath73 , much bigger than the scales of observed condensations .",
    "the interplay of anisotropic thermal conduction and turbulence has been implicated for the observed bimodality ( in terms of core entropy and cooling times ; @xcite ) of galaxy clusters ( @xcite ) .",
    "the idea is that the hbi shuts off thermal conduction when turbulence is weak and is unable to overcome effective stable stratification due to hbi , leading to a global catastrophe checked by strong agn feedback . on the other hand",
    "if turbulence is strong ( @xmath74 km s@xmath75 ) , magnetic field lines are isotropic and allow significant heat flux into the core leading to thermal balance without significant agn feedback .",
    "while this is a promising explanation , it is not the only one .",
    "one can imagine the observed bimodality as a natural outcome of cold mode feedback ( @xcite ) .",
    "initially the cooling time is short and it triggers massive cold accretion .",
    "excessive feedback heating raises entropy and the cooling time of the icm , and quenches massive accretion in the cold phase .",
    "slowly , after a long cooling time , the cooling cycle can begin again .",
    "thus in this model , clusters are expected to show a bimodal core entropy distribution , corresponding to a cool core state prone to forming multiphase gas and a non - cool - core state with a long cooling time ( see , e.g. , fig . 15 in ) .",
    "thus , the observed bimodality does not necessarily constrain thermal conduction and turbulence in the icm .",
    "the sharpness of the observed cold fronts , buoyant bubbles and small scale kelvin - helmholtz rolls observed in galaxy clusters argue for a suppressed / anisotropic thermal conduction ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we show that the observations of cold gas in different mass halos can also constrain global thermal conduction in cores of galaxy clusters .",

    "<S> we examine the role of thermal conduction and magnetic fields in cores of galaxy clusters through global simulations of the intracluster medium ( icm ) . in particular , we study the influence of thermal conduction , both isotropic and anisotropic , on the condensation of multiphase gas in cluster cores . </S>",
    "<S> previous hydrodynamic simulations have shown that cold gas condenses out of the hot icm in thermal balance only when the ratio of the cooling time ( @xmath0 ) and the free - fall time ( @xmath1 ) is less than @xmath2 . since thermal conduction is significant in the icm and it suppresses local cooling at small scales , it is imperative to include thermal conduction in such studies . </S>",
    "<S> we find that anisotropic ( along local magnetic field lines ) thermal conduction does not influence the condensation criterion for a general magnetic geometry , even if thermal conductivity is large . </S>",
    "<S> however , with isotropic thermal conduction cold gas condenses only if conduction is suppressed ( by a factor @xmath3 ) with respect to the spitzer value .    </S>",
