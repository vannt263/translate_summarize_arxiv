    "luminous maser emissions in the @xmath2 22 ghz line of water have now been detected from more than 20 active galaxies , a list of which is given in table 2 of the recent review by moran , greenhill & herrnstein ( 2000 ) . in almost every case where the size of the emission region has been determined interferometrically ,",
    "the water maser emission has been found to originate primarily within a parsec- or subparsec - sized region that is coincident with the active nucleus of the galaxy , suggesting that active galactic nuclei are the energy sources that ultimately power the observed water maser emission . in several sources ,",
    "the geometry is strongly suggestive of a circumnuclear accretion disk ( e.g. miyoshi et al.1995 ) .",
    "theoretical models for the collisional excitation of water masers ( e.g. de  jong 1973 , neufeld & melnick 1991 ) place requirements on the physical conditions in the emitting region . luminous water maser emission is favored by molecular hydrogen densities , @xmath3 , in the range @xmath4 , water abundances , @xmath5 , and gas temperatures @xmath6",
    "k. a minimum temperature requirement is imposed both by the excitation requirement for the maser transition and by the fact that water abundances are significantly enhanced at temperatures @xmath6  k by the reaction @xmath7 followed by @xmath8 ( e.g. elitzur & de  jong 1978 ; neufeld , lepp & melnick 1995 ) .",
    "an additional requirement is that the gas temperature must significantly exceed the temperature of the radiation field at mid- to far - infrared wavelengths : thus some energy source that directly heats the circumnuclear gas in active galaxies is needed to explain the observed water maser emission .",
    "x - rays from the active nucleus ( neufeld , maloney & conger 1994 , hereafter nmc94 ) , shock waves within a circumnuclear accretion disk ( maoz & mckee 1998 ) , and viscous heating ( desch , wallin & watson 1998 , hereafter dww98 ) have all been proposed as the energy source responsible for heating the masing gas .",
    "detailed models for water masers in x - ray heated gas have been presented by nmc94 , who considered the water maser emission as a function of depth into an x - irradiated slab .",
    "those models showed that the physical and chemical conditions within x - ray heated gas are conducive to the excitation of water masers , and that  given reasonable assumptions about the nature of the circumnuclear emission region ",
    "x - ray heating could account for the typical luminosities of water masers observed in agn .",
    "collison and watson ( 1995 , hereafter cw95 ) subsequently made the important point that for certain parameters the maser emission can be significantly enhanced by the absorption of non - masing far - infrared water lines by dust , a process not included by nmc94 .",
    "since agn are known to exhibit significant and rapid variability ( e.g.  ulrich , maraschi , & urry 1997 ) at optical , ultraviolet , and particularly x - ray wavelengths ( e.g.  mushotzki , done & pounds 1993 ) , maser models that invoke x - ray heating naturally raise the question of how the water maser emission would respond to changes in the incident x - ray and bolometric fluxes .",
    "this question , to be addressed this letter , is also strongly motivated by observations of cooordinated maser variability in ngc 1068 that have been reported recently by gallimore et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . in  2 below",
    ", i present the results of a general parameter study for the equilibrium maser emission from a warm dusty medium . in ",
    "3 , i consider how the maser emission responds to changes in the illuminating x - ray flux or in the dust temperature within the masing medium . in  4 ,",
    "the results are discussed with specific reference to the water masers in ngc 1068 .",
    "the collisional excitation of water masers within a warm dusty medium has been modeled by wallin & watson ( 1997 ) in the limit where the medium is optically thick to far - infrared continuum radiation . as previously pointed out by cw95",
    ", this limit often applies to circumnuclear gas in agn , given the continuum dust opacities typically present ( draine & laor 1993 ) . the effect of continuum opacity is to place a lower limit on the escape probability for non - masing far - infrared transitions of water , allowing maser emission to occur even at great depths within a circumnuclear disk or gas cloud and enhancing the cooling rate due to far - infrared water emissions ( dww98 ) .    in the limit where the medium is optically thick to far - infrared continuum radiation ,",
    "the water level populations are determined solely by the local conditions and are dependent on the gas temperature , @xmath9 , the dust temperature , @xmath10 , the h@xmath0 density , @xmath11 , and the water abundance @xmath12 .",
    "since water abundances @xmath13 are predicted for regions of luminous water maser emission , i have constructed a grid of models for fixed @xmath14 that span a broad region in the three dimensional parameter space defined by @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "the water level populations are given by the usual equations of statistical equilibrium ( e.g. cw95 ) , with the rates for all radiative processes diminished by an escape probability @xmath15 ( \\ln [ e + \\pi^{-1/2 } \\alpha_{ij}^{-1}])^{1/2 } $ ] , where @xmath16 is the ratio of dust continuum opacity to line center opacity for the transition from @xmath17 to @xmath18 ( hollenbach & mckee 1979 , cw95 ) .",
    "for consistency with the previous work of cw95 , we assume a continuum absorption coefficient of @xmath19 for wavelengths @xmath20 and @xmath21 for @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the density of h nuclei . for comparison , the probability of escape from a semi - infinite plane parallel slab is @xmath24^{1/2})^{-1}$ ] in the limit where the line center optical depth @xmath25 ( hollenbach & mckee 1979 ) .",
    "comparing these expressions , we find that dust absorption dominates the effective escape of far - infrared water emissions for dust optical depths @xmath26 , corresponding to column densities of h nuclei , @xmath27 .",
    "following neufeld & kaufman ( 1993 , hereafter nk93 ) , i solved the equations of statistical equilibrium for 179 rotational states of ortho - water , adopting the collisional rate coefficients of green , maluendes & mclean ( 1993 ) for transitions among the lowest 45 states and a simple extrapolation for transitions involving states of higher energy . the assumed line width , defined as velocity shift needed to reduce the opacity from its peak value by a factor e , was @xmath28 .",
    "once the statistical equilibrium equations have been solved , the cooling rate due to water emissions and the rate of maser emission under conditions of saturation may be obtained straightforwardly ( e.g. neufeld & melnick 1991 ; nk93 )",
    ". the results i obtained for the maser emissivity are in good agreement with those presented previously by wallin & watson ( 1997 ) .",
    "if the gas is in thermal equilbrium , then the required heating rate is equal to the cooling rate , which  for the conditions of relevance here  is dominated by water cooling and gas - grain collisional cooling ( neufeld et al .",
    "1995 ) . using the gas - grain cooling rate adopted by dww98 and the water cooling rate obtained above , i computed the equilibrium heating rate , @xmath29 , and used it in place of @xmath9 as one of the three dependent variables .",
    "figure 1a shows a contour plot of the gas temperature , @xmath9 , and the maser efficiency , @xmath30 , as function of @xmath10 and @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath32 is the rate at which maser photons are emitted per unit volume , the superscript 0 indicating that the results apply to the case where the dust optical depth is large ( watson & wallin 1997 ) and the subscript sat indicating that the maser emission is assumed to be saturated .",
    "the heating rate , @xmath29 , is defined following the notation of maloney , hollenbach & tielens ( 1996 , hereafter mht96 ) as the heating rate per hydrogen nucleus ( with units erg s@xmath33 ) .",
    "the maser efficiency @xmath34 is thus the fraction of the input power that emerges as 22 ghz maser radiation .",
    "the results shown in figure 1a apply to a fixed molecular hydrogen density @xmath35 .",
    "as required by the second law of thermodynamics , figure 1 shows that @xmath36 in the limit @xmath37 .",
    "there is a minimum value of the heating rate ( defined by the curve @xmath38 ) below which @xmath39 is insufficient to support a population inversion .",
    "the vertical line at @xmath40 represents the _ maximum _ x - ray heating rate that can be sustained without the gas being dissociated ( nmc94 ) .",
    "thus the region for luminous maser action within an x - ray heated medium lies to the right of the curve @xmath38 , to the left of the line @xmath41 , and above the curve @xmath42  k ( the latter requirement being needed for consistency with the large water abundance of 10@xmath43 that has been assumed ) . figure 1b presents analogous results to those in figure 1a , but now @xmath34 and @xmath9 are shown for a fixed dust temperature ( 500  k ) as a function of @xmath3 and @xmath44 .",
    "results shown in figure 1 apply to conditions of thermal equilibrium .",
    "the effects of changing the heating rate and dust temperature can now be considered .",
    "the timescale for the gas to re - establish thermal equilibrium after a change in the heating rate or dust temperature is given by @xmath45 @xmath46 /   10^{-28 } \\rm erg\\,cm^3\\,s^{-1})^{-1 } \\",
    ", yr.$ ] let us first consider the effects of changing the heating rate . on timescales greater than @xmath47 , an increase in the heating rate increases the difference between the gas and dust temperatures and increases the rate of maser emission .",
    "the response is then conveniently characterized by the logarithmic derivative @xmath48 , which is plotted in figure 2 ( dashed curve ) for @xmath49 and @xmath50  k. except for small values of @xmath29 close to the threshold for maser action , the derivative @xmath51 lies within a factor of 2 of unity , implying that changes in the heating rate are accompanied by comparable fractional changes in the maser emission rate .",
    "the results plotted in figure 2 are premised on assumptions of constant density and water abundance . the density is only expected to change on a dynamical timescale , which is typically much longer than @xmath47 .",
    "the molecular fraction , @xmath52 , only changes on the x - ray ionization timescale , which is given ( mht96 ) by @xmath53 / 10^{-28 } \\rm erg\\,cm^3\\,s^{-1 } ) ^{-1 } \\ , yr$ ] and is a factor @xmath54 greater than the cooling timescale . even if the molecular fraction is constant , however , the water abundance can change in response to changes in the temperature .",
    "this effect , the inclusion of which lies beyond the scope of the present study , is unlikely to be important except when the gas temperature lies close to the threshold for rapid water production ( @xmath55  k ) or when the x - ray ionization rate lies close to the threshold for molecular dissociation .",
    "if the heating rate varies , the gas temperature and maser emissivity @xmath32 can not respond on timescales any shorter than @xmath47 .",
    "however , @xmath32 _ can _ vary on timescales shorter than @xmath47 if the dust temperature changes rapidly .",
    "the thermal inertia of the dust grains is negligible , so the timescale on which the dust temperature can change is controlled by the diffusion time for the far - infrared continuum radiation , given by @xmath56 ^ 2    \\,[n({\\rm h}_2 ) / 10^{9 } \\ , \\rm cm^{-3}]^{-1 } \\ ,",
    "yr$ ] , where @xmath57 is the distance below the irradiated surface of the cloud and @xmath58 ( assumed @xmath59 ) is the corresponding optical depth at far - infrared wavelengths .    under circumstances where the dust temperature varies on timescales shorter than @xmath47  as it might in response to variations in the incident bolometric flux from the agn , for example ",
    "the gas temperature remains constant but the maser emissivity varies as a result of changes in the difference between the gas and dust temperatures , @xmath60 .",
    "the response is now characterized by the derivative @xmath61 , the subscript @xmath9 indicating that the gas temperature is held constant .",
    "the dotted curve in figure 2 shows the value of this derivative , again for the case where @xmath49 and @xmath50  k. two features of this curve are particularly noteworthy .",
    "first , the value of @xmath61 is always negative because @xmath62 decreases as @xmath10 increases .",
    "second , @xmath61 can become much larger than unity for small values of @xmath29 .",
    "this behavior occurs because the maser emissivity is primarily controlled by @xmath62 ; a small fractional change in @xmath10 causes a large fractional change in @xmath62 when @xmath63 .",
    "the results presented in figures 1 and 2 can now be discussed with reference to recent observations of the seyfert galaxy ngc 1068 .",
    "gallimore et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have recently reported that two maser features in ngc 1068 , symmetrically placed in doppler velocity about the systemic velocity of the host galaxy , flared simultaneously with a rise time of at most 22 days . given the emission region structure elucidated by earlier vlba observations ( greenhill & gwinn 1997 ) , the velocities of the maser features involved suggest that they are symmetrically located at distance @xmath64 pc on either side of the nucleus . unless the simultaneity of the flares is entirely happenstance , they were presumably coordinated by a signal that propagated from the nucleus .",
    "the results presented in figure 2 suggest two possible mechanisms for how the maser flares might be coordinated : ( 1 ) variations in the central x - ray luminosity , @xmath65 , might simultaneously change the heating rates in the masing regions ; or ( 2 ) variations in the intrinsic bolometric luminosity , @xmath66 , might simultaneously change the dust temperature .",
    "unfortunately , the average x - ray and bolometric luminosities are rather uncertain for ngc 1068 , since the central source is obscured even for hard x - rays ; i adopted the estimates of pier et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , who compiled observations obtained over a wide range of wavelengths and assumed that 1% of the total intrinsic luminosity is reflected towards us .",
    "these estimates of the luminosities imply a 1  100  kev x - ray flux @xmath67 at the distance of the flaring masers and a characteristic dust temperature @xmath68  k. expressions given by mht96 then imply an x - ray heating rate @xmath69 at column density @xmath70 below the irradiated surface of the maser emission region . for column densities greater than @xmath71 ,",
    "thomson scattering becomes important and increases the effective column density appearing in the above equation for @xmath29 by a factor @xmath72 .    in figure 3 ,",
    "relevant constraints are plotted to the normal , the column density @xmath70 refers to the shielding column density , the timescale @xmath73 is reduced by a factor sec@xmath74 , and the dust temperature should be reduced by a factor @xmath75 .",
    "an additional assumption is that dust absorption dominates the removal of far - infrared line photons , requiring @xmath76 . ] as a function of @xmath3 and @xmath70 .",
    "molecules are present above and to the right of the line @xmath77 .",
    "maser action can occur below and to the left of the curve @xmath38 .",
    "the observed variability can be driven by changes in the x - ray heating rate for parameters to the left of the line @xmath78  yr ; or alternatively by changes in the dust temperature for the region to the left of the line @xmath79  yr and to the right of the line @xmath78  yr . in either case , the minimum required h@xmath0 density for a variability timescale of 0.05  yr is @xmath80 . in figure 4 ,",
    "the derivatives @xmath81 and @xmath82 are shown for several values of the density . since the dust temperature increases as @xmath83 , the latter derivative is given by @xmath84 .",
    "figures 3 and 4 indicate that the simultaneous flaring of the two maser features in ngc 1068 could plausibly be coordinated _ either _ through variations in the heating rate _ or _ through variations in the dust temperature .",
    "the former mechanism would be unique to x - ray heating whereas the latter might apply in principle even if shock heating or viscous heating were responsible for the maser emission .",
    "observationally , the mechanisms might be discriminated by searching for correlations between the maser emission and x - ray and bolometric luminosities , although in the case of ngc 1068 the fact that we observe only reflected radiation from the nucleus will introduce uncertain delays that will be difficult to remove .",
    "maser variability induced by a varying x - ray heating rate will be characterized by a positive correlation with @xmath65 ( with a time delay determined by the different light travel times , of course ) , while variability induced by a varying dust temperature will be characterized by a negative correlation with @xmath66 .",
