    "the chain of harmonic oscillators maintained out of equilibrium by means of stochastic heat reservoirs , is one of the few systems for which the nonequilibrium invariant state has been obtained rigorously @xcite .",
    "however , due to the lack of any phonon scattering mechanism , its heat conductivity @xmath1 diverges linearly with the size of the chain .",
    "consequently , the fourier s law of heat conduction @xmath2 , relating the heat flux @xmath3 with the imposed temperature gradient @xmath4 does not hold . as a matter of fact",
    ", the integrability of the harmonic chain makes impossible for the system to support a temperature gradient .",
    "it was already recognized by debye that the presence of nonlinearities in the dynamics is a necessary condition for the occurrence of a _ normal transport _ ,",
    "i.e. a finite heat conductivity in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , years later fermi , pasta and ulam would found that nonlinear dynamics does not necessarily induces a statistical behaviour @xcite .    in the last decade ,",
    "numerical simulations and analytic arguments have contributed to clarify the role of nonlinearities in the thermodynamic limit @xcite . in some studies ,",
    "anharmonicities have been introduced by means of self - consistent local thermostats , @xcite .",
    "further attempts to derive fourier s law in deterministic systems have been reported ( see review papers @xcite and references therein ) . however , no rigorous derivation exists of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the validity of fourier s law .",
    "moreover , there is still a number of open questions concerning the steady state , such as the role of boundary conditions ( bc in the following ) , while the convergence towards the stationary state is even less explored .",
    "stochastic models are rather useful in that they can effectively reproduce the evolution of deterministic nonlinear systems , while allowing for analytic solutions .",
    "bolsterli , rich and visscher considered harmonic chains in which each oscillator is in contact with a stochastic thermal reservoir @xcite .",
    "then , the stationary state is obtained assuming a self - consistent condition , namely the energy current between the local reservoirs and the respective oscillator is zero .",
    "recently , it has been proved by bonetto et .",
    "that this linear model leads to a gaussian invariant measure and the temperature profiles are linear @xcite .",
    "a drawback of this model is that , strictly speaking , energy is not conserved by the bulk dynamics ( see also @xcite where energy current from the reservoirs becomes zero in the long time limit , and @xcite for their treatment in terms of nonequilibrium green function formalism ) .",
    "another model that can be explicitly solved is the kipnis - marchioro - presutti ( kmp ) lattice model , in which stochastic collisions mix the energy of neighboring particles , conserving the total energy , but not the momentum @xcite .",
    "this model satisfies fourier s law and a linear temperature profile is obtained .",
    "energy conserving stochastic noise has been also used in lattice model systems , as natural generalizations of kmp and of the single exclusion process ( sep ) @xcite .    in the same spirit of kmp ,",
    "basile et al . have recently studied a harmonic chain in the presence of random collisions among triples of nearest - neighbour oscillators @xcite .",
    "this latter process , which conserves both energy and momentum , amounts to a diffusion on the energy shell . in this system",
    ", it is proven that the energy - current autocorrelation decays as @xmath5 and thereby heat conductivity diverges with the size of the system @xmath6 , as @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "more recently , jara et al . have studied the relationship between anomalous heat transport and fractional diffusive processes @xcite .",
    "they find that in the infinite system , the dynamics leading to anomalous transport is obtained from a levy stable process that corresponds to a space - time scaling given by the fractional diffusive operator @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the gradient operator .    in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "we have studied a harmonic chain with both energy- and momentum - conserving noise ( and fixed bc ) .",
    "the model , a slight variant of the one introduced in @xcite , is amenable to analytical calculations , as the evolution equations for the covariance matrix are linear ( see also @xcite ) . taking a suitable continuum limit , recalled in section [ sec : change ]",
    ", we obtained a solution for the covariance matrix in the stationary state @xmath10 . from this solution",
    "we derived exact expressions for the temperature profile and the heat current , finding that the heat conductivity diverges as in @xcite .",
    "remarkably , the temperature profile ( equation ( 8) in @xcite ) is parameterfree , suggesting that it may represent a wider class of systems . to our knowledge",
    ", this is the first example of an analytic expression for the temperature profile in a system characterized by anomalous heat transport and confirms that a nonlinear shape persists in the thermodynamic limit .    in this and in the companion paper @xcite",
    "we extend the previous analysis to the nonstatonary case , obtaining a hydrodynamic equation ruling the relaxation of covariance matrix towards the stationary state .",
    "more precisely , here we analytically investigate the continuum limit , by progressively eliminating the fast variables .",
    "the second part contains a detailed numerical analysis of all aspects that are not ( easily ) accessible to an analytic investigation , including the case of free bc , and the estimate of finite - size effects . at variance with normal heat conduction ,",
    "the role of bcs is very important in the anomalous case .",
    "for instance , in disordered chains of linear oscillators , the same system may even behave as a thermal superconductor or as an insulator , by simply switching from free to fixed bc @xcite . in the present context",
    ", we find that in the thermodynamic limit and given bath temperatures , fixed and free bc give rise to the same scaling behaviour , but macroscopically different values of the heat flux .",
    "even more surprising , we find that the stationary value of the heat flux varies the coupling strength with the heat baths only for free bc .",
    "the numerical analysis @xcite demonstrates that these effects are caused by boundary layers , where the scaling behaviour of some observables changes with respect to the bulk .",
    "this phenomenon , which is associated with strong deviations from local equilibrium , hinders the development of an analytical solution in the general case .",
    "nevertheless , for fixed bc , we demonstrate that the boundary layers do not affect the relevant physical observables , and an explicit solution can be obtained for the evolution of the temperature profile .",
    "our results , obtained for large but finite chains , are consistent with those derived directly in the infinite - size limit @xcite .",
    "this was not a priori granted in the presence of long - range correlations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "model ] , we define the stochastic model and introduce the main notations .",
    "more precisely , in section [ sec : cov ] , we introduce the covariance matrix , by adopting a different definition with respect to @xcite , so as to be able to treat both free and fixed bc .",
    "the corresponding ordinary differential equations are derived in sections [ sec : cov ] and [ sec : boundaryeqs ] , with reference to the bulk and boundaries , respectively . in section",
    "[ sec : change ] we perform a further change of variables to simplify the treatment of the continuum limit , discussed in section [ sec : expansion ] .",
    "there , we define the smallness parameter , @xmath11 ( @xmath6 is the chain length ) and thereby map the discrete spatial indices @xmath12 , and @xmath13 of the correlation matrices onto two continuous variables ( continuum limit ) @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "moreover , we introduce an ansatz for the scaling behaviour of the different variables , as suggested by the numerical analysis presented in the companion paper @xcite .",
    "the internal consistency of the resulting equations confirms _ a posteriori _ the correctness of our initial choice . in section [ sec : results ] , we anticipate the main results to allow the reader appreciating them without being distracted by the technical details .",
    "the derivation of the partial differential equations and the elimination of the fast degrees of freedom is illustrated in sections [ sec : dynamics ] , [ sec : bc ] , with reference to the bulk and boundary dynamics , respectively .",
    "the relaxation towards the stationary state is then discussed in section  [ sec : relax ] .",
    "the numerical computation of the spectrum of the covariance evolution operator corroborates the analytical results .",
    "some concluding remarks are finally presented in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "we consider a homogeneous chain of @xmath6 harmonic oscillators of unit mass and frequency @xmath16 .",
    "the first and @xmath6-th oscillators are coupled to langevin heat baths at different temperatures .",
    "the equations of motion of this system are @xmath17 here @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the momentum and displacement ( from its equilibrium position ) , of the @xmath20-th oscillator and @xmath21 are independent wiener processes with zero mean and variance @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath24 is the coupling constant . additionally , the deterministic dynamics is perturbed by random binary collisions between nearest - neighbour oscillators occurring at a rate @xmath25 .",
    "these collisions are defined so that total momentum and energy are conserved .",
    "this type of stochastic noise is known in the literature as _ conservative noise_.    the phase - space probability density @xmath26 evolves according to the equation @xmath27 the first term corresponds to the usual liouville generator of the dynamics , acting on the probability density as @xmath28 with the @xmath29 vector @xmath30 , and the @xmath31 matrices @xmath32 and @xmath33 are @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the average temperature @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the relative temperature difference ( @xmath38 ) , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the null and unit @xmath41 matrices , @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the negative of the discrete laplacian @xmath44 the stochastic collision generator is @xmath45 \\ .\\ ] ] each term in the sum expresses the probability balance for each elementary process in which the momenta of each pair @xmath46 are exchanged with a rate @xmath25 .    in this paper",
    "we consider either free or fixed boundary conditions and the choice adopted will be explicitly stated wherever needed .",
    "the main subject of our analysis is the evolution of the covariance matrix of this system , namely the two - point correlation functions of the phase space variables . in order to develop a formalism that is both able to describe the case of fixed and free b.c .",
    ", we consider the correlators of relative displacements and momentum , namely @xmath47 .",
    "more precisely , we study the covariance matrix , @xmath48 where the correlation matrices @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , of respective dimension @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are defined as @xmath55 and @xmath56 denotes the average over phase space probability distribution function @xmath57 .",
    "note that @xmath49 and @xmath51 are symmetric by definition , while @xmath50 has no definite symmetry .    in terms of the relative displacements ,",
    "the boundary conditions are defined by imposing @xmath58 for free bc and @xmath59 for fixed bc .",
    "using @xmath60 instead of @xmath61 is necessary since the average of @xmath62 is not well defined when free bc are considered .",
    "this is at variance with @xcite , where we considered the correlators of the variables @xmath63 .",

    "@xmath77 also holds for the boundary terms , and since it deals with momentum variables only , it is independent of the specific bc .      as a consequence of the physical boundary conditions imposed on the oscillators of the chain edges , the border terms of the covariance matrices ,",

    "it is therefore convenient to introduce some of these combinations as new variables .",
    "an important example of such combinations is @xmath96 which has a precise physical meaning : its diagonal elements @xmath97 correspond to the local balance between kinetic and potential energies .",
    "if our system satisfies the virial theorem , then we should find that @xmath98 for all @xmath12 . as we will discuss in the following section [ sec : bbx ] ,",

    "we will assume and discuss the modifications for the resonant case @xmath126 where appropriate .",
    "the last step before proceeding to the derivation of the partial differential equations consists in transforming the discrete indexes of the correlators into two suitable continuous variables .",

    "nevertheless , in the limit @xmath129 the effects of the nonlinearities are localized at the boundaries of the domain and thus , do not complicate the study of the bulk dynamics .",

    "we refer the reader to section 4.1 of @xcite .",

    "from a physical point of view , case ( @xmath150 ) corresponds to the only situation in which the coupling can be perfectly tuned to avoid an impedance mismatch on the boundaries .",
    "unfortunately , we were not able to find an explicit solution in this case .    inspection of the equations of motion reveals that the temperature field @xmath35 is the slowest variable ( it evolves on a time scale @xmath153 ) .",
    "since @xmath154 and @xmath155 relax on a time scale @xmath156 they can be adiabatically eliminated by setting their time derivative equal to zero in equations and . by further eliminating the field",
    "@xmath122 , we obtain the fourth - order equation @xmath157 that is formally equal to the equation solved in @xcite , the main difference being that here @xmath120 is time dependent .",

    "this is reminiscent of the spectrum of the eigenvalues of the fractional laplacian @xmath163 , thus suggesting that the evolution of the temperature field is ruled by some underlying fractional diffusion equation on hydrodynamic scales @xcite .",

    "therefore , to study the evolution of the fast variables , we are obliged to include the higher order terms ( losses are actually provided by the @xmath173 term , the other being perturbations of the source term ) . after this remark , we are authorized to adiabatically eliminate @xmath121 and @xmath174 .",

    "a complete solution of the dynamical problem requires solving the set of partial differential equations - on the whole domain @xmath196 , including its boundary at all times . in a general context ,",
    "the difficulty of obtaining a full solution depends on the constraints along @xmath197 .",
    "if they amount to algebraic conditions or if the boundary dynamics is faster than the bulk dynamics , then one deals with standard type of _ static _ bc . in the opposite case , it is the bulk dynamics that can be adiabatically eliminated and the relevant ( long - term ) evolution would be controlled by what happens along the boundaries .    in the first section we study the dynamics of the covariance elements close to the diagonal and derive a differential equation describing the evolution of the temperature profile .",
    "later , in section [ sec : bby ] we study how the physical bc determine the dynamics of the correlators along the boundaries @xmath198 .",
    "the bc along the diagonal are not connected with the physical bc of the chain , but rather with the symmetry of the various matrices . in [ ap : diff - diag ] , we derive the differential equations describing the evolution of the covariances at @xmath143 , ( [ diag - diff - a]-[diag - diff - d ] ) and ( [ ldiag - diff - a]-[ldiag - diff - d ] ) . as the diagonal terms",
    "@xmath117 and @xmath119 appear only as differences with their respective off - diagonal counterparts , it is convenient to introduce @xmath200 and @xmath201 , where we benefit of the numerical investigations to anticipate that the latter difference is of higher order than the single addenda . the same scaling as its addenda leads to _ unphysical _ super fast evolution . ]    by introducing @xmath202 and @xmath203 and using , we obtain the following set of partial differential equations describing the evolution at @xmath143 : @xmath204 where we have considered the first two leading contributions to the evolution of each variable and , for the sake of compactness , we have introduced @xmath205 like in the bulk , the variables evolve over manifestly different time scales , and the temperature field @xmath35 is the slowest one .",
    "therefore we proceed by adiabatically eliminating the other variables , starting from the fastest ones . by setting the first three time derivatives equal to zero and considering only the leading terms , equations , and",
    "lead to @xmath206 moreover , the stationary solution of yields @xmath207 by now inserting and into , and setting the time derivative @xmath208 equal to zero , we obtain .",
    "this equation has an obvious meaning : @xmath122 is symmetric by definition across the diagonal , so that we naturally expect @xmath122 to have be maximal for @xmath143 .",
    "furthermore , by using in , we obtain the second relevant constraint . from and",
    ", one can easily find that @xmath209 . by then going back to and , and using the constraints and ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath210 altogether , once the five conditions contained in , and are satisfied , it turns out that the derivatives of all seven boundary variables ( [ bb - a]-[bb - g ] ) are equal to zero to leading order .",
    "in particular we see that the variable @xmath174 remains undetermined , but this is not a problem , as it is of higher order in @xmath105 and does not contribute to the leading - order evolution of the physically relevant variables .",
    "additionally , with the exception of @xmath122 , all the variables are expressed as a function of the temperature profile @xmath35 , whose evolution must be determined if we want to find a closed solution .",
    "it turns out that the leading contribution of @xmath110 to @xmath211 is zero .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to go one order further in the perturbative analysis .",
    "this can be easily done by noting that the leading contribution to @xmath212 is equal to that of @xmath213 ( see [ diag - diff - a ] ) .",
    "subtracting from and setting the time derivatives equal to zero we find that , up to @xmath110 , @xmath214 by inserting this into and retaining terms up to @xmath215 , we obtain equation . by recalling that @xmath216 is proportional to the divergence of the heat flux along the diagonal , we recognize that is nothing but the continuity equation for the energy and could have been derived simply on the basis of physical arguments .",
    "however , the relaxation of the temperature profile towards the stationary state , occurs on a time scale that is @xmath217 , _",
    "i.e. _ , for @xmath218 . as a consequence",
    ", we can conclude that the bulk dynamics is faster than that occurring along the diagonal and can , thereby , be adiabatically eliminated as anticipated in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , in order to complete the treatment , we must complement with its physical bc , as it is a ( one - dimensional ) partial differential equation . without the need of a formal treatment",
    ", it is easily understood that these bc are simply @xmath219 . as a matter of fact",
    ", the relaxation on the boundaries occurs on a finite time scale ( @xmath220 ) , i.e. it is basically instantaneous with respect to the above mentioned time scales .      in this section",
    "we analyse the conditions that the physical boundary conditions , either fixed or free , impose on the covariances . at the chain edges , where the system is directly coupled to the heat baths stochastic evolution ,",
    "the dynamics is different from that in the bulk : on the one hand the deterministic restoring force is not counterbalanced by the boundary and on the other hand , the stochastic collision for the edge oscillators is also a `` one - sided '' process .",
    "consequently , we introduce new auxiliary variables to distinguish the boundary dynamics from its bulk counterpart . more precisely , we define @xmath221 , @xmath222 and @xmath223 .    in [ ap : diff - border ]",
    "we derive the partial differential equations describing the dynamics of the covariance at @xmath224 for fixed and free bc .",
    "however , in this case we are not entitled to use in order to assign the correct order in @xmath105 of the covariance variables . as we have discussed in section [ sec : results ] , there exist a boundary layer , namely a region around @xmath198 of size @xmath169 , where the scaling of the covariance matrix on @xmath105 differs from .",
    "this bl has been further studied numerically in @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that if we insist using then mathematical consistency requires that the order of _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath99 is @xmath108 and not @xmath110 , which is also what we numerically observe in @xcite .",
    "however , can not differentiate the scalings in the bl from those in the bulk .",
    "consequently , in this section we do not use the expansions and limit ourselves to extract some physical information from the leading contribution determined only by the differential structure of the equations .",
    "first we focus on fixed bc .    for fixed bc we end up with four equations for the bulk variables and four equations for the boundary variables , - .",
    "since all equations evolve on time scales of @xmath109 , they can be adiabatically eliminated from the bulk dynamics , which is at least @xmath108 . by taking all time derivatives to zero and solving the resulting set of relations",
    ", we find that in the stationary state all boundary variables coincide with the respective bulk counterparts , @xmath225 and that @xmath226 it is interesting to point out that these relations are independent of the parameters of the system and that imply that the bulk variables are continuous at the boundaries .",
    "recalling that in @xmath115 is of higher order than its symmetric counterpart @xmath114 , we do obtain .",
    "it is interesting to note that the indetermination of @xmath227 and @xmath228 , on which the effects of the bl are mostly observed , does not affect the leading order dynamical solution of the physically relevant fields .",
    "therefore , for fixed bc , the existence of a bl does not impede us from using the boundary relations and determining the evolution of @xmath51 and @xmath114 .",
    "we now turn our attention to free bc . as seen in [ ap : free ] , in this case , only two auxiliary variables along the boundaries are necessary , @xmath229 corresponding to the non symmetrizable term , and @xmath230 . from -",
    "we find that when the three conditions @xmath231 are satisfied , the four time derivatives are equal to zero ( to leading order ) , thus satisfying the stationary state solution . by using these relations in  - , we obtain the relevant mathematical conditions , @xmath232 there are two main differences between , and the equations above : first , , depend on the variable @xmath99 , which , as we have discussed , it is the variable whose behaviour is most affected by the bl .",
    "second and more important , the free bc relations now depend on the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath16 .    by combining and",
    "we find that @xmath233 if @xmath234 , then @xmath235 ( or at least @xmath110 ) , consistently with our expectations from the bulk dynamics . in this resonant case",
    "the boundary condition reduces to @xmath236 .",
    "though simple , we have not found a way to derive an explicit solution of the bulk equation which satisfies this constraint .    in the non resonant regime @xmath237",
    ", implies that @xmath114 and @xmath99 are of the same order along the boundary .",
    "the numerical studies presented in @xcite confirm this prediction , but show also that this is because @xmath99 is of @xmath108 .",
    "such an observation is seemingly inconsistent with the bulk analysis which predicts @xmath99 to be of higher order .",
    "as said , the only way to solve the paradox is by invoking the presence of a bl connecting the two different scaling regimes .    summarizing this section ,",
    "the bc for @xmath238 reveal a crucial difference between fixed bc and free bc . in the former case they are independent of parameters of the system , which in turns imply that the asymptotic profile , as well as the leading term of the heat flux are _ universal_. in the latter case both quantities depend on the coupling strength with the heat baths @xmath239 . in this very atypical situation",
    "the contact with the baths may lead to measurable macroscopic effects .",
    "note in particular , that the heat flux for a system with anomalous thermal conductivity , like the one that concerns us , in general may depend on the type of boundary conditions , even in the infinite volume limit .",
    "the evolution of the temperature profile is determined by , subjected to conditions and . since the temperature field evolves on a slower time scale ,",
    "the bulk dynamics can be adiabatically eliminated .",
    "therefore , it suffices to solve for @xmath120 and plug its solution into . as discussed above ,",
    "an explicit calculation is feasible only for fixed bc , where the first of conditions implies that we can , following @xcite , expand the time - dependent solution of @xmath120 as @xmath240 \\ .\\ ] ] the fourier coefficients satisfy the ordinary differential equation @xmath241 whose explicit solution yields @xmath242 where @xmath243 and we have discarded the components which diverge for @xmath244 . by differentiating the equilibrium solution of with respect to @xmath14 , we realize that the condition is equivalent to @xmath245 , which in turns implies that @xmath246 .",
    "if one is interested only in the stationary solution , equation implies that @xmath247 , namely that the heat flux is constant along the chain .",
    "this condition transforms itself into distinct equations for the coefficients @xmath248 , which can therefore be determined ( apart from a multiplicative factor ) . afterwards , with the help of we can determine @xmath249 .",
    "the unknown multiplicative and additive factors are eventually removed by imposing @xmath250 .",
    "we do not report these calculations as they would closely follow what already reported in @xcite .    here",
    "we wish to solve the dynamical problem , particularly for the temperature field @xmath0 .",
    "let us consider its fourier expansion where we have only included the terms that are appropriate for fixed bc . to write down closed equations for the coefficients @xmath251 , we must face the problem that the two sides of equation are expanded in a different set of functions , namely sines and cosines , respectively and the problem is therefore not diagonal . by using vector notations with an obvious meaning of the symbols , we obtain from and , @xmath252 where @xmath253 and @xmath254 .",
    "we can thus write a closed equation for @xmath255 , @xmath256    a numerical evaluation reveals that @xmath257 is almost diagonal .",
    "in fact , the eigenvectors are very close to fourier sine - modes @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig1 ] , we report the eigenvalues in ascending order , versus the index @xmath258 that is equal ( within a proportionality factor ) to the corresponding wave number .",
    "the data align almost perfectly along a straight line ( in log - log scales ) that corresponds to a scaling with a power @xmath259 .",
    "the deviations observed at small wave numbers are not due to the truncation of the operator @xmath257 ; they express the fact that @xmath257 is intrinsically defined on a finite domain . in @xcite , we show that the numerical solution of the entire dynamical operator ( without any approximation ) confirms our analytical predictions .",
    "altogether , the space - time scaling of indicates that the evolution of the temperature field @xmath0 is , on the considered time - scales , ruled by a diffusion equation with a fractional laplacian @xmath163 .",
    "recently , this has been shown to be the case for a similar model system @xcite , directly in the infinite-@xmath6 limit ( i.e. without including the effect of the boundary conditions ) .     of the linear equation .",
    "the eigenvalues are expressed in @xmath260 time units .",

    "we have presented a detailed description of the relaxation towards the nonequilibrium steady state in a model of harmonic oscillators with conservative noise . to our knowledge , this is an almost unique instance where relaxation phenomena can be studied in great detail in a realistic setup . by implementing the continuum - limit ideas previously introduced in @xcite we have obtained a set of partial differential equations describing the evolution of the covariance matrix . in the bulk ,",
    "the velocity - velocity and the symmetric component of the velocity - position correlations are the relevant ( slow ) variables : they appear to evolve on a time scale of order @xmath261 .",
    "this means that in the bulk , relaxation phenomena are mostly controlled by the propagation of sound waves .    along the boundaries",
    ", the evolution of the relevant two - point correlators can be explicitly determined to lowest order in @xmath105 .",
    "again , these correlators evolve on different time scales , the temperature field being the slowest one ( its dynamical equation evolves on a time scales @xmath262 ) . by",
    "adiabatically eliminating the fast variables , we find that @xmath0 satisfies an energy continuity equation , where the expression for the current can be obtained from the stationary solution of the bulk equation . altogether , the temperature field @xmath0 appears to satisfy a diffusion equation with a fractional laplacian @xmath163 .",
    "however , the relationship with fractional brownian motion should be further explored .",
    "in particular , it is not yet clear to what extent the temperature profile can be obtained from the solution of the fractional equation in a finite domain .",
    "the case of free bc remains open in view of the difficulties arising along the boundaries , where the mathematical conditions depend explicitly on system parameters such as @xmath16 and @xmath24 .",
    "this is not only the indication of a lack of `` universality '' but implies also that some variables ( namely @xmath99 ) must scale differently in the bulk and along the boundaries . as a result , boundary layers are expected to arise ( and this is confirmed by the numerical analysis carried out in the companion paper @xcite ) which would require a separate analysis .",
    "this is one of the open problems that will be worth investigating in the future , especially in the perspective that a similar scenario might hold in generic nonlinear deterministic systems . only in the resonant case @xmath263",
    ", boundary layers do not exist .",
    "however , even in this limit , the mathematical conditions holding on the boundaries are sufficiently complicate to prevent the derivation of explicit expressions ( at least , to the best of our knowledge ) .",
    "all of our analysis has been _ restricted _ to two - point correlators .",
    "the main reason is that the dynamical equations are exactly closed onto themselves , so that there is no need to invoke higher - order correlators .",
    "moreover , this analysis allows determining exact expressions for the most relevant variables such as the heat flux and the temperature profile .",
    "however , one should not forget that the scaling behaviour of heat conductivity in this stochastic model ( @xmath264 ) differs from that of generic nonlinear systems , where @xmath265 .",
    "is this an indication that a faithful description of such systems needs including higher - order correlators ?",
    "more modestly , it would be already interesting to check to what extent a gaussian approximation of the invariant measure based on the knowledge of two - point correlators can accurately describe other variables such as , e.g. , energy fluctuations .",
