    "synchronization processes on complex networks has received a lot of attention during the last decades @xcite .",
    "the interplay between the dynamical evolution of oscillators and their local interactions ( as given by the complex topology of a network ) usually results in non - trivial phenomena of relevance to physical , biological , technological and social systems .",
    "first introduced by pecora and carroll @xcite , the master stability function ( msf ) is nowadays one of the main theoretical methods for the study of network synchronization .",
    "msf is indeed a powerful tool to analyze the stability of the synchronization manifold when identical systems of oscillators are diffusively coupled .",
    "originally applied to undirected networks , the msf approach has been later extended to investigate enhancements and optimization of complete synchronization in weighted and asymmetric topologies ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "in @xcite the authors stated the so - called heterogeneity paradox , i.e. the fact that heterogeneous networks , wherein distances between nodes are relatively short , are less stable , in terms of synchronization , than their homogeneous counterparts .",
    "soon after , a proper and adequate weighting of the link strengths was shown to overcome this paradox , based again on concepts sparkling from the msf formalism @xcite .",
    "following works , have shown how different network s topological features influence the stability of the synchronous state , such as : heterogeneity of the node degree , degree - degree correlations , average shortest - path , betweenness centrality or clustering .",
    "these latter studies indicate that altering the structure of a network may result in maximizing the stability of the synchronous state , thus achieving a _ maximally stable synchronization structure _ @xcite .",
    "enhancement of the networks synchronizability can also be achieved by the application of genetic algorithms increasing the stability of the synchronized state . in this case , the networks self - organize by disconnecting the hubs and connecting peripheral nodes , thus increasing the homogeneity and leading to what is known as _ entangled networks _",
    "@xcite .    in our study",
    ", we report the enhancement of the stability of complete synchronization of an ensemble of dynamical units , when coupled simultaneously in different dimensions .",
    "we are concerned with a multivariable coupling , where the dynamical systems are coupled through different dimensions according to a certain structure of connections ( see fig.[fig01 ] for a schematic illustration ) .",
    "in particular , we consider a generic dynamical system whose associated vector state @xmath0 ( with @xmath1 ) evolves according to @xmath2 .",
    "each one of the @xmath3 state variables of the dynamical system at a given node can be coupled to the corresponding variable of any of the other systems ( i.e. , nodes ) of the network .",
    "equivalently , we can think of our system as a network with @xmath4 layers , each one accounting for the structure of couplings at each variable of the system .",
    "this multilayer point of view illustrated in fig.[fig01 ] is , in fact , just accounting for a multivariable coupling between the nodes of a network , nevertheless it will help us to provide a more concrete representation of the structure of the system , and possible connections to applications .",
    "so we will make use of it at certain points . if the coupling between oscillators does not include some of the state variables , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath5 , the topology of the corresponding layers to those variables would be trivially given by a zero adjacency matrix , so we would not consider them to be proper layers ( as is the case of the layer corresponding to variable @xmath6 in fig.[fig01 ] ) .",
    "for simplicity , we consider a bidirectional coupling between the same variables of each system ( i.e. each layer is an undirected network ) .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] with an example of the case @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "interestingly , our framework connects with the so - called _ hypernetwork _ formalism introduced by sorrentino @xcite . in this latter work",
    ", the author shows that a msf approach to hypernetwork synchronization is possible when the laplacian matrices @xcite of different layers ( accounting for the coupling through each variable ) have the same basis of eigenvectors , _",
    "i.e. _ , when they are simultaneously diagonalizable .",
    "this is a condition that has been shown to be fulfilled for two layers in three cases : ( i ) the laplacian matrices of the different layers are commuting ( a condition that automatically allows for a msf approach whatever the number of layers if the laplacian matrices form a pairwise commuting set ) , ( ii ) one of the two layers is unweighted and fully connected , or ( iii ) one of the two layers has an adjacency matrix of the form @xmath9 with @xmath10 . additionally , ref .",
    "@xcite contains an extension of the approach in @xcite to more general topologies by making use of a simultaneous block diagonalization of laplacian matrices corresponding to different layers , thereby decreasing the dimensionality of the linear stability problem .    in our work",
    ", we consider the topology to be the same in each layer , trivially falling , from the of view of hypernetworks , into category ( i ) of ref .",
    "@xcite . this way",
    ", we present a study on how the stability of the synchronous state is enhanced by finding an optimal balance for the coupling between the different variables in a network of identical oscillators with multivariable coupling . on the one hand , we provide results based on extensive numerical simulations of networks of rssler - like oscillators to show the applicability of the proposed ideas and how the msf can help us to find the adequate balance between the couplings that optimizes the stability of the synchronous state of a network . on the other hand , by constructing an electronic version of the model , we show that these predictions are in good agreement with the experimental evidences in spite of the idealizations used in the theoretical treatment .",
    "in this section we explain how stability of the synchronous state can be enhanced by engineering a multivariable coupling function between nodes in a network and what balance between coupling variables is the most adequate . for the sake of concreteness we focus on a set of rssler - like oscillators",

    "the adjacency matrices @xmath26 and @xmath27 contain the topology of each of two layers , each one accounting for the coupling through the @xmath11 and @xmath11 variables .",
    "elements @xmath28 and @xmath29 are one when nodes @xmath30 and @xmath31 are connected and zero otherwise . with these parameters",
    "the oscillators display chaotic dynamics due to the nonlinearity introduced in @xmath32 , which consists on a piecewise function defined as : @xmath33    the coupling between oscillators is here controlled by two parameters : @xmath34 being the coupling strength and @xmath35 controlling how the coupling strength is distributed between variables @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this way , @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) leads to a coupling restricted to variable @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , while a sweep of @xmath35 in the interval @xmath38 $ ] allows for a weighted combination of both @xmath11 and @xmath12 variables .",
    "notice that the role of the parameter @xmath35 is therefore that of exploring the consequences of unevenly distributed coupling on the stability of synchronization , which in the past were the object of specific studies in space extended systems @xcite and weighted monolayer graphs @xcite .",
    "here however , the difference in the weight assigned to each variable introduced by @xmath35 implies a different balance of two system s variables in the coupling configuration , but does not affect the un - directionality of each one of the network s links .",

    "when the coupling is introduced through the @xmath11 variable ( fig .",
    "[ fig03].(a ) ) , the rssler - like oscillators behave as a class iii for any value of the noise strength ( within the range @xmath76 ) , i.e. the system only synchronizes for intermediate values of the coupling strength @xmath49 .",
    "when the noise strength @xmath65 is increased , the synchronization error increases , leading to a complete loss of the synchronization for large values of @xmath65 . for couplings such that @xmath77 or larger , the network becomes unstable in the sense that the strong coupling makes the individual oscillators abandon the basin of the attractor , and their dynamics blow up .",
    "this type of instability is to be expected , as a similar phenomenon is observed in individual rssler - like oscillators for some initial conditions ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the reader should notice that no such problems beset the computation of the msf , as the maximum lyapunov exponent transverse to the synchronization manifold is computed from effectively one individual oscillator along a trajectory that follows the attractor dynamics .",
    "thus , there is no contradiction in the fact that the msf determines the attractor dynamics to be synchronizable , while the actual simulation of a network of 6 oscillators never attains attractor dynamics . nevertheless , this is an example of the importance of checking the practical applications of the msf predictions , specially for high values of coupling strengths .",
    "when coupling is only introduced through the @xmath78 variable ( fig .",
    "[ fig03].(b ) ) the oscillators behave as class ii systems for low values of @xmath65 , as expected . nevertheless , for moderate values of the noise strength ( @xmath79 ) the system shifts to a behavior similar to that of class iii systems , synchronizing only for intermediate values of the coupling strength .",
    "finally , when the noise is further increased ( @xmath80 , not shown here ) , the network is not able to reach the synchronized state for any value of the coupling , behaving as a class i system . this way , despite being a class ii system ( when coupled through the y variable ) , the addition of noise can make system behave differently .    finally , it is also worth analyzing how the combination of both layers increases the stability of the synchronized manifold .",
    "figure [ fig03].(c ) shows the synchronization error for @xmath67 , _",
    "i.e. _ when the coupling is equally distributed among both x and y layers .",
    "we can observe that , as suggested by the theoretical predictions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig02 ] , the combined coupling of the x and y variables enhances the network stability , so that the synchronization of the system is maintained even for high values of the noise strength .",
    "obviously , only for small values of the coupling strength , here measured as @xmath49 , unsynchronized motion is observed , as it is expected in class ii systems .",
    "note that the boundaries of the region where synchronization becomes robust show an excellent agreement with the zero crossings of the msf . on the other hand , in the areas where synchronization is most robust against the presence of noise , the optimal @xmath49 from that point of view is not always close to the minimum of the msf .",

    "more general , fully multilayer topologies could be considered by resorting to the hypernetwork formalism introduced in @xcite , and for greater generality one can use the method in ref .",
    "@xcite . with this methodology ,",
    "the case of @xmath87 could be addressed at the cost of introducing some more complexity to the problem .",
    "nevertheless , it would be of great interest , since it would raise new questions such as what the adequate combination of topologies would be given a specific distribution of weights @xmath35 .",
    "second , since the parametric msf depends on the dynamical system implemented in the network , we can not guarantee the existence of an optimal balance of the distribution of coupling between layers in other dynamical systems , at least until their corresponding msf have been analyzed .",
