    "all graphs considered in this paper are simple and undirected . by @xmath0 and @xmath1 ,",

    ", the degree of a solid or hollow vertex is exactly or at least the number of edges that are incident with it , respectively .",
    "moreover , solid vertices are distinct but two hollow vertices may be same unless we states .    a graph is _",
    "outer-1-planar _ if it can be drawn in the plane so that all vertices are on the outer face and each edge is crossed at most once .",
    "outer-1-planar graphs were first introduced by eggleton @xcite who called them _ outerplanar graphs with edge crossing number one _ , and were also investigated under the notion of _ pseudo - outerplanar graphs _ by zhang , liu and wu @xcite .",
    "in fact , the notion of outer-1-planarity is a natural generation of the outer - planarity , and is also a combination of the 1-planarity and the outer - planarity . from the definition of the outer-1-planarity ,",
    "outer-1-planar graphs are a subfamily of planar graphs , which are one of the most studied areas in graph theory and an important class in graph drawing .",
    "it is now proved by dehkordi and eades @xcite that every outer-1-planar graph has a right angle crossing drawing and by auer _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite that the recognition of outer-1-planarity can process in linear time .",
    "outer-1-planar graphs are also used as a special graph family for verifying some interesting conjectures on graph colorings .",
    "for instance , it is proved that the list edge and the list total coloring conjectures hold for outer-1-planar graphs with maximum degree at least five @xcite , and the total coloring conjecture and the equitable @xmath3-coloring conjectures hold for all outer-1-planar graphs @xcite .",
    "an _ edge @xmath4-coloring _ of a graph @xmath2 is an assignment @xmath5 so that @xmath6 whenever @xmath7 and @xmath8 are two adjacent edges . the minimum integer @xmath4 so that @xmath2 has an edge @xmath4-coloring , denoted by @xmath9 , is the _ edge chromatic number _ of @xmath2 .",
    "the well - known vizing s theorem says that @xmath10 for every simple graph @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , to determine whether the edge chromatic number of a graph @xmath2 is @xmath11 or @xmath12 is interesting .",
    "however , the edge chromatic number problem is an np - complete problem , and more badly , decide whether a given simple graph with maximum degree 3 has edge chromatic number 3 is also np - complete @xcite . as far as we know ,",
    "the edge chromatic numbers of only few families of graphs have been fixed .",
    "for example , the edge chromatic numbers of 1-planar graphs with maximum degree at least 10 @xcite , planar graphs with maximum degree at least 7 @xcite and series - parallel graphs ( thus also outerplanar graphs ) with maximum degree at least 3 @xcite are the maximum degree .",
    "the edge colorings of outer-1-planar graphs were first considered by zhang , liu and wu @xcite .",
    "they proved that the edge chromatic numbers of outer-1-planar graphs with maximum degree at least 4 are the maximum degree and announced that there are outer-1-planar graphs with maximum degree 3 and edge chromatic number 4 . in this paper , we follow their work and determine the edge chromatic numbers of outer-1-planar graphs with maximum degree 3 .",
    "note that the edge chromatic numbers of graphs with maximum degree at most 2 can be easily fixed .",
    "therefore , we completely determine the edge chromatic number of outer 1-planar graphs .",
    "from now on , we assume that any outer-1-planar graph was drawn in the plane so that its outer-1-planarity is satisfied and the number of crossings is as few as possible , and this drawing is called an _ outer-1-plane graph_. we follow the notations in @xcite .",
