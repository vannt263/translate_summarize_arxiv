    "however , even though reasonable photometric and kinematic profiles of single stellar populations in several of the most luminous dsphs are available , the only clear conclusion is that the methods of stellar dynamics have so far been unable to prove whether the central regions of such haloes are cored or cusped ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "carina , fornax , sculptor and sextans all display evidence for the co - existence of at least two stellar populations with different metallicities  usually an older , more spatially extended and metal - poor population and a younger , more spatially concentrated , metal - rich population . in all cases",
    "save carina , the different stellar populations clearly have different kinematics : while the older component displays a fairly flattish velocity dispersion profile , the dispersion profile of the younger component often shows signs of a quite sharp decline with radius . as a consequence , the metal - rich population is concentrated in the central regions of the system only .",
    "this picture is shared by both dsphs  sculptor and sextans  where such kinematic profiles have been completely disentangled @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with a picture in which the dsph has undergone mainly two different star formation epochs , with an underlying evolution driven by tidal stirring in the potential of the galaxy .",
    "the metal - poor population may have undergone thermalization with the help of impulsive tidal stirring near the pericenters of orbits and of dynamical instabilities driven by the tidal field near the apocenters ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this can lead to a nearly isothermal distribution of velocities .",
    "by contrast , the metal - rich population may originate from a centrally concentrated distribution of gas , with the gas in the outskirts of the dsph being removed during the interval between the two star formation events .",
    "the spatial distribution of the gas may enforce an approximate cut in energy in the phase space distribution function of the younger stellar population .",
    "the coexistence of two different stellar populations in the same potential provides a stronger instrument to probe the properties of the dark matter halo in dsphs . a first approach is already provided by @xcite in their analysis of the two populations in the sculptor dsph .",
    "they found that , though a navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) halo is still statistically compatible with the kinematical properties of the two stellar populations of the sculptor dsph , a cored halo is a better fit in the context of the jeans equations .",
    "note however that the theorem on the central velocity dispersion proved by @xcite shows that an isotropic cored stellar density profile can not be embedded in a cusped dark matter halo , so that battaglia et al.s solutions to the spherical jeans equations are not all physical ( see also the recent result provided by @xcite ) .",
    "very recently , @xcite have used an ingenious argument to conclude that the populations in both the fornax and sculptor dsphs strongly disfavour cusped dark matter haloes . however , their result is based on the assumption that the mass estimator formula presented in @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be applied separately to both metal - poor and metal - rich stellar populations in a dsph , a hypothesis which remains to be demonstrated . although the velocity dispersion profile of the metal - poor population is consistent with a quasi - isothermal system , and thus with such a formula , that of the metal - rich is probably not ( c.f .",
    "* ) .    at the price of assuming a functional form for the distribution function of the stellar populations",
    ", we can significantly strengthen the analysis by requiring the models to reproduce at the same time the luminosity and kinematic profiles for both populations .",
    "in doing this we aim to measure a mass profile ( at least in some radial interval ) , rather than a single total mass measure at some radius .",
    "both jeans analyses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and simple phase space modelling @xcite are able to measure the total dark halo mass inside some specific radius , typically related to the half - light radius of the stellar population , but have failed to reconstruct the entire mass profile .",
    "this is because , though they are able to link the two dimensional scales of the dark matter density profile ( the scalelength @xmath8 and the characteristic density @xmath9 for example ) , they are unable to fix either of these numbers .",
    "this is very typical when the velocity dispersion profile only is fitted , as it is naturally degenerate in these two dimensional scales .",
    "however , the surface brightness profile can put independent constraints on the scalelength of the halo .",
    "we re - analyze the data for the two stellar populations in the sculptor dsph by using phase space models , instead of the less complete jeans analysis , adopting the general family of michie - king distribution functions ( king 1962 , michie 1963 ) .",
    "this represents a fairly flexible family of centrally isotropic distribution functions with an adjustable radial anisotropy in the outer regions .",
    "the two stellar populations are embedded in a dark halo whose density profile can be shaped at will , cored or cusped .    in section  [ data ] , we introduce the observational data ; in section  [ models ] we describe the motivations and the basic details of the models we develop in the paper .",
    "section  [ generalconsid ] sets out the properties of our models and establishes a compatibility criterion between the observed properties of a two populations dsph and the density profile of the dark matter halo .",
    "finally , the results are presented in section  [ results ] .",
    "although a number of our results on multiple populations in dsphs are general , it is nonetheless useful to have a particular example in mind . for this",

    "@xcite used the flames spectroscope on the vlt in the ca ii triplet region to obtain high quality radial velocities for sculptor members . to divide the stars into metal - rich and metal - poor populations , @xcite assumed a hard cut in metallicity .",

    "[ fig : data ] .",
    "battaglia at al.s procedure is open to questioning , as the metallicity is correlated with the kinematics , and the procedure may introduce biases that are not easy to quantify .",
    "we explored this issue by reanalizing the entire radial velocity detaset , looking for correlations between the position of the hard cut in metallicity and the derived kinematics .",
    "we find that the kinematics of the metal - poor population is robust against changes in the cut position , as well as against foreground contamination at large radii ( different ways to estimate the number of contaminants  see eqn  ( 1 ) in @xcite  do not result in significant variations of the velocity disperion profile ) .",
    "the metal - rich population is more prone to variations , though we find that binning size is more of an issue when compared to the position of the metallicity cut itself , which leaves the main features of the velocity dispersion profile unchanged if varied within @xmath13 in [ fe / h ] .",
    "@xcite also provide surface brightness profiles for the red and blue horizontal branch stars , which are also shown in fig .  [",

    "we re - compute the two half light radii directly from the surface brightness profiles in fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] using a model - independent technique , which does not require the assumption of any precise functional form for the surface brightness profiles themselves .",
    "we assume a gaussian distribution for the observational uncertainties of the surface brightness profiles and use them to generate syntetic surface brightness profiles through a monte carlo technique . by direct integration of these profiles",
    "we infer the half - light radii of the two stellar populations as well as their uncertainties ( variations due to the order of the interpolation of the syntetic profiles are accounted for in the final uncertainty itself ) .",
    "we obtain : @xmath18 for the half - light radii of the metal - poor and metal - rich populations respectively .",
    "both stellar populations are assumed to be embedded in a massive , extended , spherical dark matter halo , the density profiles of which can be shaped at will .",
    "the dark halo is truncated at the tidal radius of the metal - poor stellar population .",
    "given the high mass - to - light ratios of dsphs , we assume that the entire gravitational field is determined by the dark matter only and that the stellar components are just tracers .    as a flexible family of dark matter haloes , we use @xmath19 here , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the dimensional scalelength and characteristic density of the halo . in our models ,",
    "the tidal radius @xmath20 of the dark matter halo is the same as that of the metal - poor stellar population . even if , in nature , the truncation radius of the dark matter halo is larger than the stellar tidal radius , the potential experienced by the stars remains unchanged .",
    "the metal - rich population is allowed to have a smaller tidal radius .    throughout the paper ,",
    "we will concentrate on the following two choices : @xmath21 the first choice yields the cosmologically - motivated navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) model .",
    "the second is a standard example of cored model , with the same asymptotic density fall - off as the nfw profile ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "we are inspired by the fact that , as a result of relaxation processes , the final distribution function of the stars in phase space tends to near - isothermality , at least in the very central parts .",
    "this idea is supported by the universal flatness of the velocity dispersion profiles of the dsphs at least close to the centres ( evans , an , walker 2009 ) , as well as numerical simulations of tidal stirring of dsphs ( mayer et al .",
    "1 shows that for the sculptor dsph the metal - poor population has a flat dispersion profile out to at least @xmath23 pc .",
    "the metal - rich profile is perhaps more debatable , though consistent with a flattish profile within @xmath24 pc .",
    "deviations from flatness of the velocity dispersion profiles can be ascribed to either anisotropy or tidal effects . in principle , since the two populations reside in the same potential and experience the same tidal perturbation , they should share the same cut in energy too if this is tidal in origin . however , we are motivated by the idea that the metal - rich population has indeed been formed by gas which was concentrated in the central and more protected regions of the dsph .",
    "thus , its cut - off in radius may be much smaller than the formal tidal radius . in what follows , we therefore assume that the more extended metal - poor population has the same tidal radius as the dark halo , but allow the radial truncation of the metal - rich population to be set by the data .    the michie - king distribution function or df ( king 1962 , michie 1963 ) is a function of two integrals of the motion , the energy @xmath25 ( per unit mass ) and the angular momentum @xmath26 ( per unit mass ) , namely @xmath27 where @xmath28 - 1 .",
    "\\label{eq : king}\\ ] ] the gravitational potential @xmath29 is , in general , the total gravitational potential of the system , but here we assume that the stars can be treated as simple tracers .",
    "the dimensional free parameters of the michie - king df are as follows :    \\(1 ) the velocity dispersion parameter @xmath30 , which , for a fixed gravitational potential , tunes the scalelength of the associated luminous component ;    \\(2 ) the tidal radius @xmath20 , which is the external edge of the system , truncated by the tidal effects of the galaxy , or by the original energy distribution of the star forming gas ;    \\(3 ) the anisotropy radius @xmath31 , which is approximately the characteristic length scale associated with variations in the anisotropy profile ;    \\(4 ) the characteristic stellar density @xmath32 . as long as the stars are just tracers in the potential of the dark halo , this parameter is an overall normalization , and has no other effect on the model .    to our set of dimensional parameters , we can associate a useful set of dimensionless parameters .",
    "we use the scalelength of the halo @xmath8 and its characteristic density @xmath9 as dimensional references , and denote dimensionless quantities by a super - script hat , so that the dimensionless half - light radius , anisotropy radius and tidal radius are @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively .",
    "the dimensionless velocity dispersion is @xmath36 where , respectively for an nfw and a cored halo , we have ( see also @xcite ) @xmath37 a michie - king model for a single stellar population in a dsph is defined by the three numbers @xmath38 and two scalings set by the dark halo @xmath39 .",
    "a two - population model for a dsph therefore has @xmath40 free parameters .     and @xmath41 , but with different truncations .",
    "the dashed profile shows the osipkov - merrit limit  ( [ ombeta ] ) . ]",
    "michie - king dfs are never tangentially anisotropic , and range from perfectly isotropic to highly radial .",
    "this does not seem unduly restrictive on examining the velocity dispersion profiles in fig .  1 , both of which decline with radius .",
    "this fact does not suggest any great preponderance of tangential bias in the orbits .",
    "the anisotropy profiles @xmath42 , ( where @xmath43 is the tangential velocity dispersion ) of michie - king dfs are always isotropic at the centre , but can be adjusted at larger radii through the anisotropy radius @xmath44 . however , michie - king models with the same anisotropy radius may have completely different degrees of anisotropy ( depending on the values of the other two free parameters ) .",
    "thus , in the following , we prefer to parametrize the anisotropy of our models using the value of the anisotropy profile at the half - light radius @xmath45 also , in order to avoid systems subject to radial orbit instability ( e.g. , barnes , hut & goodman 1986 ) , we only consider @xmath46 .      to understand the properties of michie - king models , it is helpful to distinguish two opposite physical regimes .",
    "the dfs can vary from exponential in the energy , typical of isothermal systems , to a power - law dependence in the  reduced  energy @xmath47 , typical of strongly truncated systems .",
    "notice that we are exploring a much wider range of michie - king models than is usual in their most common application , the study of globular clusters .    in the isothermal limit ,",
    "most of the stars are unaffected by the tidal cut in kings df  ( [ eq : king ] ) , which is thus dominated by the exponential term : @xmath48}/{\\sigma^2}}\\gg 1\\ .",
    "\\label{eq : ineq}\\ ] ] an equivalent way to state this inequality is @xmath49 .",
    "when this holds true , the dependence of the michie - king dfs on energy @xmath25 and angular momentum @xmath26 becomes close to the linear combination @xmath50 , which describes the osipkov - merritt case ( osipkov 1979 , merritt 1985 ) .",
    "thus , in this instance , the anisotropy asymptotes to the profile @xmath51 this describes systems which are isotropic in the center ( @xmath52 ) and become more radially anisotropic at larger radii ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the isotropic , and therefore fully isothermal limit , is equivalent to additionally imposing @xmath54 this corresponds to the case in which the half - light radius of the stars is smaller than the other length - scales in the problem . in this regime",
    ", isothermality ensures a flat velocity dispersion profile .",
    "furthermore , if the stars are deeply embedded in their dark matter halo ( i.e. @xmath55 ) , then the stellar profile has a gaussian density - law if embedded in a cored halo , and an exponential one if embedded in an nfw halo .",
    "amorisco & evans ( 2011 ) show that these systems satisfy : @xmath56 where @xmath0 is the exponent of the first non - constant term in the taylor expansion of the total potential at the center .",
    "so , @xmath1 for the nfw case , @xmath57 for a cored dark halo .",
    "the opposite of the isothermal regime is the case in which the exponential term in kings df  ( [ eq : king ] ) is of order unity .",
    "this limit describes strongly truncated systems , in which the dimensionless half - light radius @xmath58 and the dimensionless tidal radius @xmath59 are of the same order .",
    "the asymptotic expression for the anisotropy is : @xmath60 this is true for any michie - king model close to its tidal edge .",
    "so , any michie - king model becomes isotropic on approaching its tidal radius .",
    "this is evident from the anisotropy profiles plotted in fig .",

    "strongly truncated isotropic models are essentially scale - free models , whose properties depend only on the gravitational potential @xmath61 and the tidal radius @xmath20",

    ", we have @xmath63 for fixed half - light radius @xmath58 and degree of radial anisotropy , the tidal radius realized by strongly truncated systems is the smallest in the entire family of michie - king models with a given gravitational potential .",

    "what is more surprising is that the same thing is true for the nfw halo , even though we have only a lower limit for the characteristic radius @xmath8 .",
    "however , this can be understood by noticing that , as anticipated in amorisco & evans ( 2011 ) , the mass profile @xmath75 generated by the functional relation @xmath76 becomes insensitive to the characteristic radius @xmath8 when @xmath55 .",

    "the suggestion that stellar kinematics in dwarf spheroidals ( dsphs ) may enable the structure of the dark matter halo to be mapped out is at least a decade old .",
    "it motivated programs to gather radial velocities in the bright dsphs with 4 m and 8 m class telescope and multi - object spectrographs . despite a lot of work , it has proved hard to distinguish the structure of the dark matter halo , especially at small radii , where cold dark matter ( cdm ) theories predict @xmath81 density cusps ( e.g. , navarro , frenk & white 1996 ) .",
    "for example , gilmore et al . ( 2007 ) provided a succinct summary of the then available observational evidence .",
    "they noted that analyses based on the jeans equations for six dsphs ( draco , ursa minor , carina , sextans , leo i and leo ii ) tended to suggest that the dark matter density was shallower than the @xmath81 density cusp .",
    "however , they acknowledged that the observed velocity dispersion profiles and cored light distributions were likely to be consistent with dark matter halos with both central cores and cusps .    a thorough examination of the evidence using the jeans equations for the eight brightest dsphs ( the six studied by gilmore et al .",
    "together with fornax and sculptor ) was carried out by walker et al .",
    "( 2009 ) using datasets of thousands of stars .",
    "they found that the most meaningful constraint provided by a jeans analysis was on the total mass enclosed within the half - light radius ( see also wolf et al .",
    "in particular , the jeans equations were not sufficiently powerful to distinguish between cored and cusped dark matter haloes .",
    "a companion theoretical investigation by evans , an & walker ( 2009 ) made explicit the limitations of the jeans equations .",
    "they showed how assumptions as to the surface brightness and profile velocity anisotropy could allow the misleading identification of a core or a cusp .",
    "nonetheless , this is a consequence of the interlocking assumptions made in the jeans analysis , and not the data , which are consistent with both cores and cusps .",
    "however , in at least two dsphs , there appears to be direct evidence favouring dark halos with constant density cores .",
    "first , kleyna et al . ( 2003 ) discovered kinematically cold substructure in the ursa minor dsph .",
    "they argued from numerical simulations that the persistence of such cold substructure is incompatible with the cusped profiles of cold dark matter cosmogonies .",
    "they provided an interpretation in terms of a stellar cluster dissolving in a cored dark matter halo .",
    "second , goerdt et al . ( 2006 ) and @xcite studied the five globular clusters present in the fornax dsph , which orbit at projected radii @xmath82 kpc from the centre .",
    "in a cusped dark matter halo , they would sink to the centre under the action of dynamical friction in a few gyr . in a cored dark matter",
    "halo , the dynamical friction timescale is much longer and so this provides a natural resolution of the survival problem of fornax s globular clusters .",
    "the exploration of multiple stellar populations in dwarf spheroidals is only just beginning .",
    "but there are now clear hints that it might provide a resolution of this problem . the fact that both populations reside in the same dark matter",
    "halo significantly reduces the degeneracies . to date , there have been three different attempts at modelling  each with their own strengths and limitations .",
    "it is striking that all three have come to the conclusion that the data are much more consistent with cored dark matter haloes than cusped one .",
    "battaglia et al.s ( 2008 ) investigation of the case of sculptor used the jeans equations and came to the conclusion that the data are statistically consistent with both cored and cusped haloes , though the nfw profile yields a poorer fit for the metal - rich stars .",
    "the drawback to this analysis is that it is based on the jeans equations alone , and there is no guarantee that the underlying models exist .",
    "in fact , the central velocity dispersion proved by @xcite shows that an isotropic cored stellar density profile can not be embedded in an navarro - frenk - white halo , and so there is no solution for the phase - space distribution function for the metal - poor population , despite the existence of the jeans solution .",
    "nonetheless , battaglia et al.s ( 2008 ) basic conclusion  that a cored halo model provides a better fit than an nfw halo model  seems robust and is recovered by our analysis .",
    "walker & pearrubia ( 2011 ) developed a sophisticated statistical method for assigning probabilities as to whether dsph stars belong to metal - rich and metal - poor sub - populations .",
    "this is a significant improvement on the simple cut in metallicity used by battaglia et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , which can introduce biases when metallicity is correlated with kinematics . as output from their statistical analysis",
    ", they obtain a measure of the average velocity dispersion of the metal - poor and metal - rich populations .",
    "this is used with a mass estimator of the form  ( [ eq : illing ] ) to obtain the mass enclosed at two points , namely the half - light radius of the metal - poor and the metal - rich populations . from this",
    ", the gradient of the dark halo mass profile is calculated . for the sculptor and fornax dsphs , they conclude that cusped nfw profiles are ruled out .",
    "the modelling is then simpler than a jeans analysis , but walker & pearrubia ( 2011 ) argue that it is more robust .",
    "one qualm is that the method assumes that the two components are drawn from constant velocity dispersion populations , both in the statistical analysis itself and in the application of the mass estimator formula . whilst this seems reasonable enough for the metal - poor populations in dsphs , it is not at all clear that the metal - rich population can be so described .",
    "in fact , the combined or total velocity dispersion of the total population must then decline outwards , which is certainly not the case in , at least , fornax .",
    "nonetheless , walker & pearrubia have tested their reasoning against synthetic datasets generated from a wide range of phase - space distribution functions , and it performs very well .    finally , in this paper , we have used the sculptor dataset provided by battaglia et al .",
    "( 2008 ) to build phase - space distribution functions for both the metal - poor and the metal - rich populations under the assumption of cored and cusped dark matter haloes .",
    "although both can fit the data , cored dark matter haloes are preferred .",
    "there is clear evidence of discrepancies in the surface brightness profile of the metal - rich stars near the centre for cusped haloes .",
    "notice that it is the combination of surface photometry with the stellar kinematics  rather than the kinematics alone",
    " that is providing the decisive evidence against cusped haloes .",
    "even more worryingly , the navarro - frenk - white models that are the best - fit are much less concentrated than the cosmological predictions from cold dark matter theories .",
    "typically , concentrations of @xmath83 are predicted from simulations of galaxy formation ( e.g. , colin et al .",
    "2004 ) , as compared against @xmath84 found in our analysis .",
    "the fact that all three analyses  which make different assumptions and have different strengths and weaknesses  come to the same conclusion is very striking .",
    "further modelling of other dsphs with multiple populations is needed to confirm the results .",
    "however , the evidence that the dark haloes of the dsphs around the milky way do not have cusped form , but have cores , is now beginning to look rather strong .",

    "<S> a number of dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies are known to contain a more extended , metal - poor population with a flattish velocity dispersion profile , and a more concentrated , metal - rich population with a velocity dispersion declining with radius . </S>",
