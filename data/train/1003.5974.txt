    "a lie subgroup @xmath0 of @xmath1 is said to be a _ real form _ of @xmath1 whenever its lie algebra @xmath8 is defined as the fixed point space of an antilinear involution @xmath9 . since @xmath0 has only finitely many orbits in @xmath2 ( @xcite ) , it has at least one and usually many open orbits @xmath3 .",
    "manifolds of the type @xmath2 are called _ flag manifolds _ and the open @xmath0-orbits @xmath3 are called _",
    "flag domains_. in all applications standard decompositions allow us to reduce to the case where @xmath0 is simple and therefore we assume this .",
    "note that if @xmath0 is complex , being embedded in @xmath1 by an antiholomorphic map , then @xmath10 .",
    "this is the only situation where it may not be assumed that @xmath1 is simple .",
    "it is possible that @xmath11 .",
    "this occurs when @xmath0 is compact and there are several exceptional noncompact cases as well ( @xcite , see proposition 5.2.1 in @xcite ) . from the point of view of the present work ,",
    "these cases are not of interest .",
    "thus we not only assume that @xmath0 is a simple noncompact real form of @xmath1 but also that @xmath3 is not compact .",
    "let us fix a maximal compact subgroup @xmath12 of @xmath0 and denote by @xmath13 its complexification in @xmath1 .",
    "a basic first example of matsuki - duality states that @xmath12 has exactly one orbit @xmath14 in @xmath3 which is a complex submanifold ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is in fact the only @xmath13-orbit in @xmath2 which is contained in @xmath3 .",

    "the set of all such cycles has the natural structure of complex space ( @xcite , see @xcite @xmath20 for the properties needed here ) . in the particular case where @xmath2 is projective ,",
    "it is the chow variety .",
    "its components are themselves projective algebraic and the @xmath1-action on these components is algebraic . in many situations we regard @xmath14 as the cycle @xmath21 in the cycle space and",
    "refer to it as the _ base cycle_. since the cycle space is smooth at @xmath14 ( @xcite theorem 18.6.1 ) , the notion of the irreducible component of the cycle space of @xmath2 which contains @xmath14 makes sense .",
    "this is denoted by @xmath22 and @xmath23 it should be remarked that , although it is known that @xmath24 is smooth at the base point @xmath14 , it is an open question as to whether or not it is everywhere smooth .    the following is the first main result of this paper .",
    "[ hyperbolicity ] the complex space @xmath4 is kobayashi - hyperbolic .    the proof of this result is established using the _ schubert incidence geometry _ defined by special borel subgroups of @xmath1 .",

    "each is abstractly algebraically isomorphic to some @xmath27 .",
    "these are referred to as _",
    "schubert cells_. since the @xmath25-action on @xmath2 is algebraic , every such orbit is zariski open in its closure .",
    "we denote such a closure by @xmath28 and write @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the union of the ( lower - dimensional ) @xmath25-orbits on the boundary of @xmath26 .",
    "the varieties @xmath28 , which in fact often have singularities along @xmath30 , are called _",
    "schubert varieties_. observe that the cw - decomposition of @xmath2 which is defined by the schubert varieties only has cells in even ( real ) dimensions .",
    "thus they freely generate the integral homology @xmath31 .",
    "if @xmath32 is an iwasawa - decomposition and the borel group @xmath25 contains the solvable subgroup @xmath33 , we refer to it as being an iwasawa - borel subgroup .",
    "these subgroups can be viewed in the flag manifold @xmath34 of all borel subgroups as the points on the ( unique ) closed @xmath0-orbit .",
    "now consider the set @xmath35 of ( n - q)-dimensional schubert varieties of an iwasawa - borel subgroup @xmath25 .",
    "it follows from poincar duality that at least some of the @xmath28 in @xmath35 have nonempty ( set - theoretic ) intersection with @xmath14 .",
    "the following is the essential ingredient for a number of considerations in this context ( see theorem 9.1.1 in @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath36 is an ( n - q)-dimensional schubert variety of an iwasawa - borel subgroup of @xmath1 and @xmath37 , then @xmath38 is a finite subset @xmath39 which is contained in @xmath26 . at each @xmath40",

    "if @xmath28 is as in the above theorem , then we consider the _ incidence variety _ @xmath44 it is important that , for appropriate multiplicities of its components , this is a cartier divisor .",
    "( see @xcite , @xmath20 , and the appendix of @xcite ) .",
    "theorem [ hyperbolicity ] is proved by considering the maps given by the linear systems defined by the incidence divisors @xmath45 .",
    "these are pieced together in such a way that after paying the small price of a finite map , @xmath24 is realized as an open subset of a hyperbolic domain in a product of projective spaces .",
    "the hyperbolicity of this latter domain is proved by applying the classically proven fact that the complement the union of @xmath46 hyperplanes in general position in @xmath47 is hyperbolic .",
    "the method of schubert incidence geometry has played a role in much of our work over the last years . in particular ,",
    "in @xcite we used this method to prove the hyperbolicity of the group - theoretically defined cycle space @xmath48 which is the connected component containing the base cycle of the intersection @xmath49 .",
    "the proof here of hyperbolicity in the case of the full cycle space @xmath4 is substantially more involved .",
    "it should be remarked that , except for a certain hermitian cases which are well - understood , @xmath50 only depends on @xmath0 , i.e. , it does nt vary as the @xmath1-flag manifold @xmath2 and the @xmath0-flag domain @xmath3 vary ( see @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath4 varies ( sometimes wildly ) as @xmath2 and @xmath3 vary ( part iv of @xcite ) .",
    "thus it would seem that the cycle spaces @xmath4 might provide a wide range of interesting kobayashi - hyperbolic spaces which could be useful for holomorphically realizing @xmath0-representations .",

    "[ finite - dimensional ] unless @xmath3 is holomorphically convex with nontrivial remmert reduction , the automorphism group @xmath5 is a lie group acting smoothly on @xmath3 as a group of holomorphic transformations .",
    "this leads to a detailed description of the connected component @xmath52 for every flag domain @xmath3 . in order to prove theorem [ finite - dimensional ] we characterize holomorphic convexity by a cycle condition and",
    "show that if this condition is not satisfied , then the natural map @xmath53 is finite - fibered and is a local homeomorphism onto its closed image .",
    "the desired results then follow from the fact that the automorphism group of a hyperbolic complex space is a lie group .",
    "as is indicated in the statment of theorem [ finite - dimensional ] the exception to the finite - dimensionality occurs in a setting which is optimal from the point of view of complex analysis , namely where @xmath3 is holomorphically convex but not stein .",
    "this can only occur in the case where @xmath0 is of hermitian type and even in that case it is very rare .",
    "the remmert reduction @xmath54 , which in this case is induced from a fibration @xmath55 of the ambient flag manifolds , is a @xmath0-equivariant homogeneous fibration onto the @xmath0-hermitian symmetric space of noncompact type embedded in its compact dual .",
    "this situation can be characterized in a number of ways ( see @xmath56 ) .    in @xmath57 it is shown that unless @xmath6 and @xmath7 is a maximal parabolic subgroup , or equivalently @xmath58 , it follows that @xmath59 . even when @xmath58 there are very few exceptional cases .",
    "a key point for the classification of these cases is that if @xmath60 properly contains @xmath0 , then the complexification @xmath61 also acts transitively on @xmath2 .",
    "therefore we are a position to apply onishchik s classification of that situation , i.e. , that where two different complex simple groups act transitively on @xmath2 .",
    "this section is devoted to the proof of theorem [ hyperbolicity ] . for this",

    "since this representation may not be irreducible , we let @xmath67 be the irreducible subrepresentation which contains @xmath65 as a @xmath25-highest weight vector and consider the @xmath1-equivariant meromorphic map @xmath68 defined by @xmath69 .    observe that since @xmath30 is contained in the complement of @xmath3 , the restriction of @xmath70 to @xmath4 is base point free . furthermore ,",
    "the image @xmath71 is contained in the complement @xmath72 of the hyperplane which corresponds to the section @xmath65 .",
    "note that since @xmath73 is @xmath33-invariant , the family @xmath74 is compact . as a consequence",
    "the union @xmath75 is compact and its open complement @xmath76 contains the image @xmath71 . in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) we utilize the fact that the d - dimensional @xmath1-representation on @xmath77 is irreducible to prove the following fact .",
    "the family @xmath78 contains @xmath79 hyperplanes @xmath80 which are in general position in @xmath81 .",
    "in particular , @xmath76 is kobayashi - hyperbolic .",
    "the technical work for the proof of theorem [ hyperbolicity ] amounts to carrying out the above construction for each of the schubert varieties in @xmath35 and then to show that the restriction to @xmath4 of the product of the resulting maps is finite - fibered . for a precise statement",
    "let @xmath82 be a list of the schubert varieties in @xmath62 and @xmath83 be the irreducible @xmath1-representations with highest weight vectors @xmath84 obtained as above .",
    "let @xmath85 be the associated meromorphic maps .",
    "[ finite map ] the restriction of the meromorphic map @xmath86 to @xmath4 is holomorphic and finite - fibered .",

    "this let @xmath87 be the normalized graph of @xmath88 and @xmath89 be the resulting holomorphic map .",
    "we suppose to the contrary of the claim in proposition [ finite map ] that @xmath90 is a compact complex curve in some @xmath91-fiber and that @xmath90 has nonempty intersection with the ( biholomorphic ) lift of @xmath4 in @xmath87 . under that assumption let @xmath92 denote the projection of @xmath90 in @xmath22 , @xmath93 the preimage of @xmath92 in the the universal family @xmath94 and let @xmath95 be the the ( q+1)-dimensional image of @xmath93 in @xmath2 .",
    "now consider the intersection of @xmath95 with any one of the schubert varieties in @xmath62 which for simplicity we denote by @xmath29 .",
    "since @xmath96 and every such @xmath28 intersects every cycle ( transversally ) in @xmath3 in only finitely many points , it follows that @xmath97 contains a 1-dimensional component which has nonempty intersection with @xmath3 . since @xmath98 ,",
    "the intersection with @xmath99 is nonempty .",

    "since @xmath30 is contained in the complement of @xmath3 , for those cycles @xmath103 it follows that @xmath104 .",
    "but @xmath105 . thus if @xmath106 were not a base point , it would follow that @xmath107 .",

    "recall that poincar duality in @xmath2 is realized by the intersection pairing of @xmath25-schubert varieties with schubert varieties of the opposite borel subgroup @xmath113 .",
    "in particular , there is an ( n - q)-dimensional @xmath113-schubert variety @xmath114 which has nonempty finite intersection with @xmath111 with @xmath115 .",
    "since convergence at the level of cycles ( regarded as points ) is the same thing as hausdorff convergence , it follows that if @xmath116 is sufficiently near @xmath111 in the cycle space , then @xmath117 has nonempty finite intersection with @xmath116 with @xmath118 likewise being empty .",
    "consequently there is a proper algebraic subset @xmath119 of @xmath1 with the property that if @xmath120 , then @xmath106 has finite nonempty intersection with @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",

    "the opposite borel algebra @xmath145 which consists of @xmath141 together with the negative root spaces is of the form @xmath146 and @xmath147 is the corresponding iwasawa - decomposition .",

    "thus the intersection @xmath76 of the product @xmath165 with @xmath156 has the same properties : it contains the image of @xmath4 ( now regarded as a subset of @xmath160 ) and is kobayashi - hyperbolic . to complete the proof observe that the restriction of @xmath166 to the preimage @xmath167 of @xmath76 is a proper finite - fibered holomorphic map .",
    "since @xmath76 is hyperbolic , it follows that @xmath167 is likewise hyperbolic ( @xcite , proposition 3.2.11 ) . finally , since @xmath4 has been realized as an open subset of @xmath167 , it is immediate that it is hyperbolic as well .",
    "here we discuss two equivariant holomorphic equivalence relations which are defined by the cycles in @xmath3 .",
    "the first has been introduced in [ h2 ] , but our point of view here is different and for the sake of completeness we provide the essential details .",

    "cycle connected_.    if @xmath3 is not cycle connected , then @xmath187 , i.e. , the base @xmath188 of the cycle reduction is the associated @xmath0-hermitian symmetric space .    above it was shown that @xmath12 is contained in the stabilizer of the equivalence class @xmath182 $ ] .",

    "follows immediately from that fact that the fiber of the reduction defined by cycle connectivity equivalence is the compact variety @xmath14 and the base is the stein hermitian symmetric space .",

    "the case where @xmath3 is not cycle connected is special in that @xmath5 is not a lie group .",
    "let us now describe this group .",
    "assume that @xmath3 is not cycle connected with remmert reduction @xmath54 .",
    "note that since the hermitian symmetric space @xmath188 is stein and retractible , the bundle @xmath54 is holomorphically trivial .",

    "conversely , the projection @xmath204 is equivariant with respect to @xmath205 and its ineffectivity on @xmath188 is exactly @xmath201 .",

    "positive ) space is spanned by vectors of the form @xmath452 ( resp .",
    "@xmath453 ) .",
    "one directly checks that @xmath60 has exactly three orbits in @xmath459 , namely the spaces @xmath460 and @xmath461 of positive ( resp .",
    "negative ) ( complex ) lines and the real hypersurface @xmath462 of isotropic lines .    to determine the orbit structure of the @xmath0-action is convenient to use matsuki duality . for this",
    "we choose the maximal compact subgroup @xmath12 of @xmath0 to be the copy of the unitary group @xmath463 which acts diagonally on @xmath156 , i.e. , @xmath464 .",
    "the complexification @xmath13 of @xmath12 in @xmath1 is just @xmath465 .",
    "the duality theorem states that there is a natural bijective correspondence @xmath466 between the @xmath13-orbits and the @xmath0-orbits in @xmath2 .",
    "this sends a @xmath0-orbit @xmath26 to the @xmath13-orbit @xmath467 of any point @xmath468 with @xmath469 _ the _ minimal @xmath12-orbit in @xmath26 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath470 is just the minimal @xmath12-orbit @xmath469 .",
    "we mention this `` duality '' , because it is often easier to understand the @xmath13-orbit structure than it is to understand the @xmath0-orbit structure . in this case",
    "one checks directly that @xmath13 has four orbits in @xmath2 , namely the closed orbits @xmath471 and @xmath81 , a 1-codimesional orbit with two ends whose closure @xmath92 consists of the orbit together with the projective subspaces @xmath471 and @xmath81 , and the complement @xmath472 which is the unique open @xmath13-orbit .",
    "duality implies that the closed @xmath13-orbits are the base cycles in the open @xmath0-orbits .",
    "thus @xmath0 has two open orbits which are of course contained in the two open @xmath60-orbits @xmath460 and @xmath461 . the smaller group @xmath0 stabilizes the closed @xmath60-orbit @xmath462 .",
    "there the real points @xmath473 are @xmath0-invariant .",
    "thus @xmath0 has at least two orbits in @xmath462 .",
    "but altogther it has only four orbits and therefore we have accounted for all of them : @xmath460 , @xmath461 , @xmath473 and the complement @xmath474 . in particular , @xmath460 and @xmath461 are exceptional in the sense that the smaller real form @xmath0 acts transitively",
    ".    it would be of interest to have a complete list of all such exceptional cases , in particular to determine if and when a given @xmath0-flag domain is _ properly _ contained in the corresponding @xmath60-flag domain .",
    "arguing as above one could possibly compile such a list .",
    "this would , however , seem to require a somewhat involved case - by - case discussion which would not be appropriate for the present paper .      at the initial stages of this project",
