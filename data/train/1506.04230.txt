    "recently , synchronization of coupled oscillators has been a subject of extensive study , not only due to the ubiquity of this phenomenon , but also owing to importance of its applications in engineering and biology @xcite .",
    "the conventional assumption of the theory of synchronization is that in the uncoupled state each elementary unit of the linked system is oscillatory .",
    "however no less interesting are the systems where coupling is essential for the very emergence of oscillations and not only for their synchronization and phase adjustment .",
    "the first example of coupling - induced periodicity has been propounded by smale @xcite .",
    "his abstract model of a biological cell involves chemical kinetics of four metabolites , such that the reaction equations for the set of metabolites have a globally stable equilibrium .",
    "the cell is `` dead '' , in that the concentrations of its metabolites always relax to the same fixed levels .",
    "when two such cells are coupled by linear diffusion terms , however , the resulting equations are shown to have a globally stable limit cycle .",
    "the concentrations of the metabolites begin to oscillate , and the system becomes `` alive '' .",
    "since that time , triggered by smale s seminal work , a number of plausible models have been proposed in which coupling of identical nonoscillating cells of concrete nature could generate synchronous oscillations .",
    "the majority of these models concern neural cells with excitable membrane @xcite .",
    "szatmri and chua @xcite suggested an apt term `` awakening dynamics '' for the phenomenon .",
    "the subject of the present paper is an emergence of collective oscillations in a simple system of two coupled nonoscillatory consumer - resource pairs .",
    "our choice of coupled consumer - resource equations as a matter of enquiry is dictated primarily by the abundance and importance of consumer - resource relations .",
    "consumer - resource communities are the building bricks of ecosystems . depending on a specific nature of the involved consumer - resource interactions",
    ", they can take the forms of predator - prey , herbivore - plant , parasite - host , and exploiter - victim systems @xcite .",
    "however applications of the consumer - resource models extend far beyond the ecology and are found wherever one can speak of win - loss interactions . in its broad",
    "meaning , resource is any substance which can lead to increased growth rate of the consumer as its availability in the environment is increased . as this takes place ,",
    "the resource is certainly consumed .",
    "consuming the resource means tending to reduce its availability . when carefully examined , consumer - resource models are identified in the following fields : epidemiology ( infected and susceptible ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch .  10 ) ) , laser dynamics ( photons and electrons ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch .  6 ) ) , labor economics ( share of labor and employment rate @xcite ) , theoretical immunology ( antigens and b lymphocytes @xcite ) , kinetics of chain chemical reactions ( free radicals and lipid molecules @xcite ) , and in numerous other studies from diverse disciplines .",
    "so far as we know , examples of coupling - induced synchronization of intrinsically nonoscillatory populations have never been proposed .",
    "we are going to show that interaction in a form of density - dependent cross - losses may drive two nonoscillatory consumer - resource pairs into synchronous periodic pulsing .",
    "of all types of interactions between individuals of the same population ( intraspecific interactions ) or individuals of different populations ( interspecific interactions ) of the same trophic level competition is most commonly encountered . in a broad sense , competition takes place when each species ( individual ) has an inhibiting effect on the growth of the other species ( individual ) . an inhibiting effect",
    "should be understood to mean either an increase in the death rate or a decrease in the birth rate .",
    "consider the famous consumer - resource equations proposed by macarthur @xcite :    [ crmac ] @xmath0x_{j},\\quad & j&=1,\\dotsc , m,\\label{crmac - x}\\\\ \\dot{y}_{i } & = \\bigl(\\sum\\nolimits_{j=1}^{m}c_{ij}w_{j}x_{j } -b_{i}\\bigr)y_{i},\\quad & i&=1,\\dotsc , n.\\label{crmac - y}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here dots indicate differentiation with respect to time @xmath1 , @xmath2 represents the total biomass of @xmath3th resource ( prey ) , @xmath4 stands for the total biomass of @xmath5th consumer ( predator ) species , the constant @xmath6 defines the growth rate of @xmath3th resource , @xmath7 is the carrying capacity of @xmath3th resource , @xmath8 is the rate of uptake of a unit of @xmath3th resource by each individual of @xmath5th consumer population , @xmath9 is the conversion efficiency parameter representing an amount of @xmath3th resource an individual of @xmath5th consumer population must consume in order to produce a single new individual of that species , @xmath10 is the loss rate of @xmath5th consumer due to either natural death or emigration .",
    "all parameters in are nonnegative .",
    "macarthur @xcite assumed population dynamics of the resources to be much faster than that of the consumers which enabled him to approximate @xmath2 in by its quasi - steady - state value derived by setting the right - hand side of to zero . as a result",
    ", he succeeded in reducing slow - scale subsystem of equations to the well - known lotka ",
    "gause ( lvg ) model @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xmath14 .",
    "resources do not enter lvg equations explicitly being parameterized by carrying capacities .",
    "more recently , such an asymptotic reduction has also been carried out for a model of competition where species ( with continuous trait ) consume the common resource that is constantly supplied , under the assumption of a very fast dynamics for the supply of the resource and a fast dynamics for death and uptake rates @xcite .",
    "consumer - resource model assumes that competition between consumer species is purely exploitative : individuals and populations interact through utilizing ( or occupying ) a common resource that is in short supply .",
    "quite on the contrary , lvg model describes competition strictly phenomenologically , as direct interference where consumers experience harm attributed to their mutual presence in a habitat ( e.g. through aggressive behavior ) .",
    "however we should stress that neither does macarthur s reduction claim that interference competition entirely results from `` more fundamental '' trophic competition , nor does it urge us to hastily consider direct competition as some `` derived '' concept .",
    "what it states is that when the dynamics of the consumers are associated with a slow time scale , the effects of exploitation competition are indistinguishable from those of interference competition .",
    "and at slow - time scale , coefficients @xmath15 of merely would add to `` true '' interference coefficients @xmath16 if the interference is accounted for properly in .",
    "most mathematical models dealing with coupled consumer - resource pairs or multilevel trophic chains ignore contributions of intraspecific and interspecific interference effects in consumers . indeed",
    ", the empirical data like @xcite do indicate that @xmath17 may be negligible in comparison with @xmath15 .",
    "nevertheless , literature advocating the explicit accounting for direct interference shows that incorporation of self - limitation and cross - limitation terms in the equations at the consumers level can provide for the stable coexistence of many species on few resources [ @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ] .    moreover ,",
    "if we are to assume dynamics of the resources to be much slower than that of the consumers , it is likely that we have to introduce interference competition terms in subsystem .",
    "consider the following modification of representing coupled two - consumer , two - resource equations :    [ crcoupled ] @xmath18    instead of the logistic mode of resource supply , as is the case in macarthur s model , our model is based on so - called `` equable '' mode of resource exploitation @xcite , by which the quantities of available resources are held constant by a continuous - flow system . according to and",
    ", a constant concentration of @xmath3th resource ( @xmath19 ) flows into a defined volume with the rate @xmath20 while unused resource flows out with the specific rate @xmath21 , in much the same manner as in a chemostat @xcite .",
    "in natural conditions , the equable modes of feeding , for instance , can be found on the first trophic level of ecosystem , among autotrophs .",
    "we assume that the consumers functional response is linear . endowing the consumers with nonlinear ( and even distinct from one another ) functional responses",
    "seems a premature complication of the model .",
    "such an extension of macarthur s generic model , as shown by abrams and holt @xcite , may lead to several notable modes of behavior , including coexistence via periodic cycling .",
    "however , the resulting coupled oscillations in their model are rather entrained than `` awakened '' , because one of the two involved species , when unlinked , is able to oscillate .    besides , in and intraspecific competition strength @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) measures direct interference of individuals within @xmath5th consumer population with each other resulting in an additional per capita loss rate @xmath24 ; interspecific competition strength @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ; @xmath27 ) quantifies direct interference effect from @xmath28th consumer on @xmath5th consumer resulting in an additional per capita loss rate , @xmath29 , of the latter .",
    "equations contain two important assumptions .",
    "first , they assume that the resources are noninteractive . on higher trophic levels , however , resources may interact and the possibility of competition among the resources was originally pointed out by levine@xcite and empirically confirmed by lynch @xcite .",
    "since then , a whole series of theoretical papers ( based on macarthur s equations ) have been published on two - predator , two - prey systems with interference competition between two self - reproducting prey species @xcite .    as seen from and",
    ", there is no intraspecific interference competition within the resource populations , in distinction to macarthur s model . yet",
    "the resource abundance would remain finite even in the absence of the consumer .",
    "the second assumption of our equations is that the consumers interact only directly , through interference competition .",
    "they can not compete trophically , through their use of resources , as each consumer specializes on one resource only . in the models of pure trophic competition , like macarthur s logistic - supply model @xcite and equable - supply model @xcite ,",
    "each predator is allowed to feed on both prey .",
    "intraspecific interference competition is allowed within the consumers as well .",
    "owing to this assumption , a consumer would remain bounded even though the abundance of the associated resource happened to be constant .",
    "the novelty of model is that it considers time hierarchy of macarthur s consumer - resource equations to be reversed by assuming dynamics of the consumers to be much faster than that of the involved resources and articulates the importance of direct competition mechanisms within the framework of this assumption .",

    "resource 1 increases due to its constant inflow until it overcomes losses for consumer 1 ;    with a sufficient resource stock , consumer 1 now emerges .",
    "the population 1 exhibits a spike due to the fast time scale of the consumer equations .",
    "the sharp increase in population saturates the available resource level , so resource 1 drops .",
    "cross - losses cause consumer 2 to wash out ;    quantities @xmath51 and @xmath53 relax to their equilibrium values , as if there were only one uncoupled consumer - resource pair .",
    "consumer 2 is essentially zero .",
    "resource 2 is increasing , like resource 1 did in part 1 ;    resource 2 surpasses the losses , consumer 2 emerges and the subsequent cross - losses cause consumer 1 to wash out .",
    "the spiking consumer 2 also causes a substantial decrease in the available stock of the associated resource .",
    "the sequence begins again .",
    "the essential feature of the model is that when one consumer is very scarce , the whole coupled system behaves like an uncoupled consumer - resource pair .    presenting",
    "his famous model smale remarked that `` it is more difficult to reduce the number of chemicals to two or even three '' @xcite .",
    "as distinct from smale s example , the bilinear coupling in our case makes self - sustained synchronous oscillations possible for just two variables .",
    "as we have seen , phase trajectory of the system constantly moves from the neighborhood of unstable boundary equilibrium @xmath83 where only consumer 1 is present , to the neighborhood of @xmath84 where consumer 2 completely dominates , back to @xmath83 , and so on in cyclic alternation .",
    "this kind of trajectory was termed `` heteroclinic cycle '' by kirlinger @xcite .",
    "a heteroclinic cycle occurs when the outflow ( unstable manifold ) from one saddle point is directly connected to the inflow ( stable manifold ) of another saddle point , and vice versa .",
    "it is closely related to another notion of the nonlinear dynamics , a homoclinic cycle , which emerges when the unstable and the stable manifolds of the same saddle coincide and form a closed loop .",
    "homo- and heteroclinic cycles are not robust structures in the sense that infinitesimally small change of system parameters destroy them .",
    "however in the practical sense , any limit cycle passing in close proximity to saddle points will be indistinguishable from a heteroclinic cycle ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the only difference is strict periodicity , although the period of the limit cycle in a neighborhood of the heteroclinic cycle may be long .",
    "besides , at the threshold of homo-/heteroclinic bifurcation the period is susceptible to external noise .    in the context of our model ,",
    "as coupling becomes stronger , the stable limit cycle swells and passes closer and closer to boundary fixed points which are node - saddles . depending on the interplay between the parameters",
    ", eventually it may bang into one or both of these equilibria creating either a homoclinic or heteroclinic cycle , respectively .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath123 and @xmath124 . on further increasing the coupling , the saddle connection breaks and the loop",
    "is destroyed .",
    "it is worth noting that heteroclinic cycles were first found by may and leonard @xcite in a classical lvg system with competing three species .",
    "however in their model the cycle is not truly periodic : as time goes on , the system tends to stay in the neighborhood of any one boundary equilibrium ever longer , so that the `` total time spent in completing one cycle is likewise proportional to the length of time the system has been running . ''",
    "moreover , may and leonard state that `` the phenomenon clearly requires at least three competitors , which is why it can not occur in models with two competitors . ''",
    "this statement is echoed by vandermeer @xcite who extended their theory on higher dimensions : `` it appears to be the case that all cases of an odd number of species follow this basic pattern , whereas all cases of even number of species result in extinction of half of the components , leaving the other half living independently at their carrying capacities . '' in view of our results , the above conclusion is by far and away true providing one stays within the framework of classical lvg equations , which in fact implies a high rapidity of the resource dynamics . in our model of just two competitors",
    "the slowness of the resource relative to the consumer is essential for the oscillations to occur , because it provides the necessary inertia to the system .",
    "the feasibility of our model is tightly bound to justification of the adopted time hierarchy in system . in ecosystems , the most common case is rapid consumption of food by species .",
    "however it seems reasonable to propose that the model may describe the first level of an ecosystem , at which the consumers are autotrophs and the resources are mineral nutrients . the ability to exploit different substrates leads to a possibility of stable coexistence of different organisms descending from a common ancestor .",
    "divergent evolution is just the emergence of new species : due to mutations two populations come into being , sharing the same genetic code but having proteins able to process different substrates . providing the environmental conditions are quite stable on the evolutionary timescale ,",
    "the inflows of inorganic substrates from the surroundings may be considered constant and the washout time of a substrate may occur much longer than the life expectancy of a species ( recall the definition @xmath125 ) .    from a non - ecological perspective , by and large similar relationships can be found in coupled longitudinal modes of laser with second harmonic generation .",
    "baer @xcite experimentally observed antiphase oscillations of two ( and more ) modes in a multimode neodymium - doped yttrium aluminum garnet ( @xmath126 ) laser with an intracavity potassium titanyl phosphate ( @xmath127 ) frequency - doubling crystal .",
    "he also proposed a model for that phenomenon in terms of the coupled rate equations . in original designations , the equations for the population inversions , @xmath128 and @xmath129 , and the intensities , @xmath130 and @xmath131 , are as follows :    [ baer ] @xmath132    where @xmath133 and @xmath134 are the fluorescence time and cavity round trip time , respectively ; @xmath135 and @xmath136 are self - saturation parameters , which determine how",
    "strongly the corresponding intensity depletes the available gain ; @xmath137 and @xmath138 are cross - saturation parameters ; @xmath139 and @xmath140 are the small signal gains ( pump parameters ) ; @xmath141 and @xmath142 are the cavity losses for the respective modes ; and @xmath87 is the nonlinear coupling coefficient due to the presence of the intracavity doubling crystal . in and ,",
    "the second - order terms @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 account for the loss in intensity of the fundamental frequencies through second harmonic generation and sum - frequency generation .",
    "it is apparent at a glance that represents coupled consumer - resource equations , where the intensities play the role of consumers , while the population inversions act as resources .",
    "structurally , baer s system is very nearly the same as system being discussed .",
    "even the time hierarchy is similar : @xmath146 , i.e. the `` resources '' change much slower than the `` consumers '' .",
    "there are three distinctions , however .",
    "first , in and , intra- and interspecific interference parameters are not independent , both of them being proportional to the coupling strength .",
    "second , in and , the two modes are allowed to `` compete '' for the active medium , so the consumer - resource pairs turn out to be further linked trophically .",
    "third , when uncoupled , the steady state of each mode is stable focus , not stable node as is the case in our model .",
    "in other words , uncoupled consumer - resource pairs in baer s system are weakly damped oscillators with the intrinsic period proportional to @xmath147 .",
    "baer performed numerical integration of for different coupling strength @xmath87 and with many different initial conditions .",
    "he revealed that as @xmath87 decreases , the mode - coupling oscillation period decreases tending to the period of intrinsic oscillations .",
    "if @xmath87 is decreased further , the oscillations cease , and the system becomes stable . with a large @xmath87 ,",
    "the oscillation period becomes quite long , and each mode appears to reach a stable intensity value before abruptly switching off ( cf .",
    "the results of our analysis ! ) .",
    "the numerical solutions correctly predicted that the two modes tend to pulse on and off out of phase with each other .",
    "subsequently , erneaux and glorieux @xcite reduced to the equations for coupled quasi - conservative oscillators and proved the existence of stable antiphase periodic solution in the case of the modes with identical parameters @xmath148 , @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "however that result has to do with the onset of low - amplitude quasi - harmonic oscillations . unlike their study , our approach deals with well - developed high - magnitude essentially nonlinear oscillations .",
    "interesting issues concern how the outcome of exploitation and interference is altered when the mode of resource supply is not constant , or when the interspecific interference is not necessarily mutually costly ( i.e. each consumer suffers a net reduction in per capita growth rate via interference from , but can gain an increase in growth rate via interference on , the other consumer ) @xcite .",
    "investigations of these possibilities may constitute a future direction for work on the model .",
    "we considered a model of two consumer - resource pairs linked by interspecific interference competition .",
    "when uncoupled , an individual consumer - resource pair has a unique stable steady state and does not admit periodic solutions . if intraspecific interference within the species is strong enough , the equilibrium is nonoscillatory .",
    "when coupling is moderately weak , the model reveals low - frequency antiphase relaxation oscillations .",
    "the consumers can not coexist even dynamically : in each of two periodically alternating states one consumer completely dominates and the other is on the verge of extinction . the most intriguing feature of the model is that each of the involved consumer - resource pairs taken separately does not oscillate ; both communities are completely quiescent , however , in interaction , when coupled in a nonlinear way , the resulting system turns into a relaxation oscillator .",
    "the author wishes to express his gratitude to the referees for their valuable suggestions .",
