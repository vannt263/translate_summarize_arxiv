    "the heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet ) is a convenient tool to explore the physics of hadrons containing a heavy quark @xcite .",
    "it provides a systematic expansion around the limit @xmath2 , in which new symmetries of the strong interactions arise , relating the long - distance properties of many observables to a small number of hadronic matrix elements . in the hqet",
    ", a heavy quark inside a hadron moving with four - velocity @xmath3 is described by a velocity - dependent field @xmath4 subject to the constraint @xmath5 .",
    "this field is related to the original heavy - quark field by a phase redefinition , so that it carries the `` residual momentum '' @xmath6 , which characterizes the interactions of the heavy quark with gluons .",
    "the effective lagrangian of the hqet is @xcite@xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 contains the components of the gauge - covariant derivative orthogonal to the velocity , and @xmath9 $ ] is the gluon field strength tensor .",
    "the leading term in the effective lagrangian , which gives rise to the feynman rules of the hqet , is invariant under a global @xmath10 spin  flavour symmetry group .",
    "this so - called heavy - quark symmetry results from the fact that in the limit @xmath2 the properties of the light constituents inside a heavy hadron become independent of the spin and flavour of the heavy quark .",
    "the symmetry is explicitly broken by the higher - dimensional operators arising at order @xmath11 , whose origin is most transparent in the rest frame of the heavy hadron : the first operator corresponds to the kinetic energy resulting from the motion of the heavy quark inside the hadron ( in the rest frame , @xmath12 is the operator for @xmath13 ) , and the second operator describes the magnetic interaction of the heavy - quark spin with the gluon field .",
    "the wilson coefficient @xmath14 results from short - distance effects and depends logarithmically on the scale at which the chromo - magnetic operator is renormalized @xcite . as a consequence of the so - called reparametrization invariance of the hqet ( an invariance under infinitesimal changes of the velocity ) , the kinetic operator is not multiplicatively renormalized @xcite .",
    "one of the most important applications of heavy - quark symmetry concerns the analysis of semileptonic weak decays of heavy hadrons .",
    "these processes are mediated by flavour - changing currents containing two heavy - quark fields , which in the hqet are represented by velocity - changing operators of the type @xmath15 , where @xmath16 represents some dirac matrix . in the heavy - quark limit ,",
    "all weak decay form factors parametrizing the current matrix elements between two heavy mesons or baryons are proportional to a universal ( isgur  wise ) form factor @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "large logarithms of the heavy - quark masses , which arise due to quantum corrections , can be summed up to all orders in perturbation theory by calculating the anomalous dimension of the operator @xmath18 in the hqet and solving its renormalization - group equation ( rge ) @xcite .    in the analysis of the symmetry - breaking corrections to the relations between form factors ,",
    "higher - dimensional current operators play an important role . at order",
    "@xmath11 , there appear local dimension - four operators of the type @xmath19 , whose matrix elements have been studied in @xcite .",
    "the renormalization of such operators is completely determined by reparametrization invariance @xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we study the renormalization of dimension - five current operators containing the gluon field , i.e.  operators of the form @xmath0 .",
    "there are several motivations for this study : the matrix elements of these operators determine part of the @xmath20 corrections to heavy - hadron weak decay form factors @xcite , which at the present level of accuracy already have to be included in some applications of the hqet , such as the extraction of the cabibbo  kobayashi ",
    "maskawa matrix element @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the same operators also play a role in the description of non - factorizable corrections in non - leptonic two - body decays of @xmath22 mesons @xcite .",
    "our primary motivation , however , is the connection between velocity - changing dimension - five operators and the velocity - conserving operators appearing at order @xmath11 in the effective lagrangian ( [ leff ] ) .",
    "clearly , for @xmath23 and in the limit of equal velocities , the operator @xmath24 reduces to the chromo - magnetic operator .",
    "more interestingly , however , there is also a connection with the kinetic operator @xmath25 .",
    "it is provided by the virial theorem of the hqet , which relates the kinetic energy of a heavy quark inside a hadron to its interactions with gluons @xcite . for the ground - state mesons and baryons ,",
    "this theorem can be written in the form @xmath26 it has been used to study the properties of the kinetic operator under renormalization , and to estimate its matrix element using qcd sum rules @xcite .    below",
    "we study first the general structure of operator mixing of current operators containing the gluon field and show that it can be described by a @xmath27 matrix of renormalization constants .",
    "we then calculate the corresponding anomalous dimensions at the one - loop order .",
    "next , we investigate the limit of equal velocities , in which case the operator basis consists of a chromo - electric and a chromo - magnetic operator , which are renormalized multiplicatively . we show that , as a consequence of the virial theorem and reparametrization invariance , the chromo - electric operator is not multiplicatively renormalized to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "this , in turn , implies an exact relation between renormalization constants , which may help in the calculation of the yet unknown two - loop anomalous dimension of the chromo - magnetic operator .",
    "finally , we consider the hadronic matrix elements of velocity - changing dimension - five operators and determine , for the case of the ground - state heavy mesons , the scale dependence of the corresponding hadronic form factors .",
    "our goal is to study the renormalization of the local operator @xmath28 , where @xmath3 and @xmath29 are the heavy - quark velocities , and @xmath16 may be an arbitrary dirac matrix . since the feynman rules of the hqet do not involve @xmath30 matrices , the structure of @xmath16 will not be altered by radiative corrections . under renormalization , the operator @xmath31 mixes with other operators carrying the same global quantum numbers .",
    "we use the background - field formalism @xcite and work in dimensional regularization , so that it suffices to consider gauge - invariant operators of the same dimension as @xmath31 .",
    "moreover , we shall not consider operators that vanish by the equations of motion , since they have vanishing matrix elements between physical states . to construct the operator basis ,",
    "we find it convenient to introduce the two vectors @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the product of the two velocities .",
    "this definition is such that @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "hence , @xmath37 can be regarded as a four - velocity , whereas @xmath38 is a space - like four vector . in the breit frame , where the two hadrons move with opposite velocities",
    ", we have @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is a spatial unit vector .",
    "since the original operator @xmath31 is invariant under hermitean conjugation followed by an interchange of the velocities , the basis operators must contain even powers of @xmath38 .",

    "we define renormalization constants @xmath44 , which absorb the ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences in the matrix elements of the bare operators , by the relation @xmath45 from the definition of the basis operators , it follows that the @xmath27 matrix @xmath46 can be expressed in terms of the four entries @xmath47 , which in general are functions of the variable @xmath48 .",
    "substituting for @xmath16 the appropriate expressions corresponding to the operators in ( [ basis ] ) , we find that @xmath49 let us denote by @xmath50 the eigenvalues of this matrix , given by the diagonal entries .",
    "since the mixing of @xmath31 with @xmath51 and @xmath52 must vanish in the limit of equal velocities , it follows that @xmath53 this implies @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
