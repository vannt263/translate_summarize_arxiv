    "water confined in carbon nanotubes serves as an ideal example of such a system .",

    "if the diameter of the nanotube is comparable to the size of a water molecule , then the water molecules can not cross one another while they are inside the nanotube and they have to move in a single file . various earlier studies @xcite suggest that under these conditions , the water molecules inside the nanotube should exhibit a kind of sub - diffusive behavior known as _ single file diffusion _ where the mean - square displacement ( msd ) scales with time @xmath2 as @xmath3 at long times . a crossover from normal mode diffusion ( msd @xmath4 ) to",
    "single file behavior has been observed in experiments on colloidal particles suspended in water inside narrow trenches @xcite and on molecules diffusing through channels in zeolites @xcite .",
    "the question whether molecules exhibit single file diffusion inside narrow carbon nanotubes has been investigated in a number of simulation studies .",
    "@xcite have studied the diffusion of oxygen molecules inside open - ended carbon nanotubes of various diameters .",
    "they interpret their simulation results implying that oxygen diffuses through wide ( 17,0 ) nanotubes via normal mode diffusion , whereas inside narrow ( 10,0 ) nanotubes , the molecules exhibit sub - diffusive behavior ( msd @xmath5 , where the exponent @xmath6 is less than unity ) . the simulations of mao _ et al . _",
    "@xcite suggest that spherical methane molecules exhibit normal mode diffusion inside closed carbon nanotubes , whereas aspherical molecules such as ethane and ethylene diffuse by a mode which is between normal and single - file . in all these simulations ,",
    "the time over which the msd is measured is rather short ( @xmath7 ps ) .",
    "also , due to finite - size effects arising from the smallness of the nanotube length ( these effects will be discussed in detail below ) , it is difficult to draw a firm conclusion about the true nature of diffusion inside the nanotube from the time - dependence of the msd . for these reasons",
    ", we believe that the simulations mentioned above do not provide conclusive evidence for sub - diffusive behavior of molecules inside a carbon nanotube . recently",
    ", striolo @xcite has performed md simulations of the diffusion of water molecules inside a ( 8,8 ) nanotube using periodic boundary conditions in the direction of the axis of the nanotube .",
    "this artificial boundary condition prevents the water molecules from escaping the nanotube and hence it is possible to obtain msd data at long times with good statistics .",
    "these simulations show that the water molecules inside the nanotube initially undergoes ballistic diffusion ( msd @xmath8 ) which crosses over to normal mode diffusion at long times .    in this work we use md simulations to study the structural and dynamical properties of water molecules inside ( 6,6 ) carbon nanotubes of diameter @xmath9 and lengths @xmath10 equal to @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 in a bath of water .",
    "since the water molecules inside the nanotube can not cross one another , a primary goal of our study is to determine whether single file diffusion occurs in this system . here",
    "the interactions among the water molecules inside the nanotube are much stronger compared to those among the colloidal particles considered in experiments @xcite that demonstrate the occurrence of single file diffusion .",
    "this can be inferred from the packing fraction of the water molecules inside the tube .",
    "the packing fraction , @xmath14 , is defined as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the number of water molecules , @xmath17 the diameter of each molecule and @xmath10 , the length of the tube .",
    "this quantity is close to unity for the water molecules inside the ( 6,6 ) nanotube ( it depends to some extent on the equilibrium density of the water molecules in the bath ) .",
    "this introduces strong correlations in the positions and displacements of the water molecules in the nanotube .",
    "these correlations and the effects of the open ends of the relatively short nanotubes considered in our study ( in particular , the fact that the range of correlations is comparable to the length of the nanotube ) have important bearings on the diffusion behavior of the water molecules .",
    "we find that the confined water molecules are spatially ordered , much like a solid , at temperatures as high as @xmath18 k. the msd of the confined water molecules increases linearly with time @xmath2 at relatively short times ( after a very short initial regime of quadratic increase characteristic of ballistic motion ) , indicating normal - mode diffusion over this time scale . at long times",
    "the msd eventually saturates .",
    "we show , by comparing the simulation results with analytic ones obtained from a simplified random walk model described below , that the observed behavior is completely consistent with normal mode diffusion of the water molecules inside the nanotube .",
    "in particular , we observe that the departure of the msd versus @xmath2 curve from the initial linear behavior is a consequence of biased sampling arising from the fact that the msd is measured only for the molecules that stay inside the nanotube .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with existing results @xcite that show that the statistics of the bursts of water molecules passing through a narrow carbon nanotube @xcite are consistent with one - dimensional random walk behavior .",
    "our work also brings out that the normal mode diffusion found recently by striolo @xcite for water molecules in narrow carbon nanotubes with periodic boundary conditions persists in the more realistic situation of open - ended nanotubes immersed in water .    the remainder of the paper",
    "is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the details of the simulation . in section 3",
    "we describe the results obtained from the md simulations for the static structure and the dynamics of the water molecules inside the nanotube . in section 4",
    "we propose a random walk model to explain the dynamics of the confined water molecules and compare the analytic results for the model with those obtained from our md simulations .",
    "section 5 contains a summary of our main results and a few concluding remarks .",
    "we have simulated a ( 6,6 ) carbon nanotube of @xmath19 diameter placed in a bath of tip3p @xcite water molecules at @xmath18k and @xmath20 atmosphere pressure . during the simulation",
    "the nanotube was held fixed inside the simulation box , with its long axis along the @xmath21 direction .",
    "the simulations have been performed using amber 7 @xcite .",
    "we have considered open - ended nanotubes of length @xmath10 equal to @xmath1 , @xmath22 and @xmath13 .",
    "a given simulation contained 1000 to 2200 water molecules depending on the size of the nanotube used .",
    "the interactions between various atoms have been described by classical force fields .",
    "the carbon and oxygen atoms were modelled as lennard - jones particles , the details of which are given in table i. the carbon - carbon bond length was @xmath23 and the corresponding spring constant was @xmath24 kcal/(mol @xmath25 , the equilibrium c - c - c angle was @xmath26 radians and the corresponding spring constant was @xmath27 kcal/(mol @xmath28 .",
    "the simulations were performed for periods varying between 8 ns and @xmath29 ns ( longer simulations were carried out for nanotubes with larger @xmath10 ) and the coordinates were stored at an interval of @xmath20 ps .",
    "to quantify the positional ordering of the water molecules inside the nanotube we have calculated the pair - correlation function for the water molecules inside the nanotube using @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the axial separation between the @xmath32 th and the @xmath33 th water molecules , n is the number of water molecules inside the nanotube and the angular brackets indicate an average over time .",
    "the calculated pair correlation functions for nanotubes of length @xmath1 , @xmath22 and @xmath13 are shown in fig .",
    "[ 802709jcp1 ] .",
    "the distinct peaks of @xmath34 suggest that there is solid - like ordering of the water molecules inside nanotube , even at a temperature of @xmath35 , for all the three tube lengths .",
    "the nearest - neighbour distance between the water molecules is @xmath36 , similar to that obtained by hummer _",
    "the heights of the peaks of @xmath34 are smaller for shorter nanotubes and the peak height decreases faster with @xmath21 as the length of the nanotube is reduced .",
    "however , this does not imply that the degree of positional order of the water molecules inside the nanotube decreases as the tube length is reduced .",
    "the differences between the results for @xmath34 for nanotubes of different length arise from a simple finite - size effect , namely that the fraction of molecules that have a smaller number of neighbors due to their proximity to the open ends of the nanotube is larger for smaller tubes .",
    "this finite - size effect on the form of @xmath34 is seen clearly on comparing the @xmath34 obtained for the @xmath1 tube with that calculated for the water molecules residing in the central @xmath1 portion of the @xmath22 nanotube , taking only the molecules in this central region in the sums in eq.([gz ] ) .",
    "this comparison is shown in fig.[802709jcp2 ] .",
    "the observation that the two correlation functions are identical confirms that the degree of positional correlations is the same in nanotubes of length @xmath1 and @xmath22 . that the water molecules are correlated over distances comparable to the length of the nanotube",
    "has important consequences on the diffusion behavior of the molecules , as discussed below .",
    "we find that the trajectories of neighbouring molecules inside the nanotube are extremely correlated . in order to quantify this correlation",
    "we have calculated the quantity , @xmath37 , where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the displacements of the @xmath32th and @xmath33th water molecules , respectively , in a time interval of @xmath40 . for this calculation , @xmath40 was taken to be @xmath20 ps .",
    "the angular brackets indicate averaging over time origins and pairs of water molecules inside the nanotube .",
    "this quantity was calculated as function of the separation @xmath21 between the molecules @xmath32 and @xmath33 for nanotubes of all three lengths .",
    "results for this correlation function are shown in fig .",
    "[ 802709jcp3 ] .",
    "it decays as the separation @xmath21 is increased , signifying the loss of correlation of the displacements of widely separated particles .",
    "the separation at which this correlation function decays to zero is close to the length of the tube , implying that the displacements of all the molecules inside the tube are correlated for tubes of all three lengths .",
    "this observation , consistent with the positional correlations shown in fig .",
    "[ 802709jcp1 ] , implies that the water molecules inside the nanotube tend to move together as a single object .",

    "the angular brackets indicate an average over time origins .",
    "the open ends of the tube allow particle exchange with the water bath . as a result , while calculating the quantity , @xmath43^{2}$ ] , for the @xmath32th water molecule , one has to ensure that this molecule has stayed within the nanotube for the entire interval of time between @xmath42 and @xmath44 . to ensure this , we have multiplied @xmath43^{2}$ ] by @xmath45 , where the quantity @xmath46 is equal to unity if the @xmath32th molecule is inside the nanotube at time @xmath2 and zero otherwise .",
    "similarly the number of time - origins which contribute for a particular molecule @xmath32 and time difference @xmath2 is @xmath47 . this way , even though the sum in eq.([msd ] ) goes over all the water molecules present in the system , only those molecules that have entered the tube",
    "at least once contribute in the calculation of the msd .",
    "the finite lifetime of the water molecules inside the nanotube makes it difficult to find sufficient number of long - lived water molecules , the identification of which is crucial for good statistics of the msd at long times .",
    "hence , the simulation was run for @xmath48 ns for the system with @xmath1 nanotube to get msd data up to @xmath49 ps .",
    "the run - time of the system with @xmath22 nanotube was @xmath50 ns to get msd data for a period of @xmath20 ns . for the @xmath13 nanotube , even after running the simulation for about @xmath51 ns , we were unable to get good quality data for the msd at long times . in this method",
    ", the short time data are obtained from averages over a large number of molecules , about 300 to 400 , and also a large number of time origins . the number of time - origins as well as the number of water molecules available for averaging decrease as one goes to longer time difference @xmath2 .",
    "for this reason , the long - time msd data are more noisy . at the longest time differences for which the msd has been reported in this work , the number of molecules contributing is approximately 50 .",
    "the time - origin averaged msd of the water molecules inside the @xmath22 nanotube is shown in figure [ 802709jcp4 ] ( top panel , solid line ) .",
    "the initial portion of the curve is linear in time , indicating normal mode diffusion . at longer times",
    ", the curve bends downward and finally it saturates to a constant value .",
    "the diffusion constant , calculated from the initial slope of the msd versus @xmath2 curve , is 2.2 , 2.5 and 2.8 ( @xmath52 ) for the water molecules inside the @xmath53 , @xmath12 and the @xmath13 nanotube , respectively . even though there is a slight length dependence , the reason for which is not clear , the value of the diffusion constant is roughly half of that of bulk tip3p water , @xmath54 .",
    "it is interesting to note at this point that the value of the diffusion constant obtained from our calculations is in agreement with that reported by berezhkovskii _",
    "_ in ref.@xcite . the diffusion constant estimated from the mean inter particle separation of @xmath55 ( this is exactly what we get from the position of the first peak of @xmath34 ) and the mean hopping time @xmath56 ps , reported by berezhkovskii _ et al .",
    "_ , is @xmath57 , which is very close to the values obtained from our simulations .",
    "a naive interpretation of the downward bending of the msd versus @xmath2 curves at longer times would be a crossover from normal mode diffusion to sub - diffusive behavior as @xmath2 is increased .",
    "in particular , it is possible to find a time window in which the local slope of the msd versus @xmath2 curve in a log - log plot is approximately equal to @xmath58 , the value expected for single file diffusion .",
    "however , such an interpretation of the data is not correct . as discussed in detail in the next section where we present a simple model for the dynamics of the water molecules inside the nanotube and compare the simulation results for the msd with analytic ones obtained for this model , the msd data shown in fig . [",
    "802709jcp4 ] are completely consistent with normal mode diffusion of the water molecules .",
    "the fact that each molecule that contributes to the calculation of the msd for time @xmath2 is required to stay inside the nanotube of finite length for the entire observation time @xmath2 leads to the downward bending and eventual saturation of the msd at long times .",
    "figure [ 802709jcp4 ] ( bottom panel , solid line ) shows the msd calculated with a fixed time origin which is taken to be the time at which each water molecule enters the nanotube .",
    "the msd shown in this plot is , therefore , the mean - square displacement of a water molecule inside the nanotube from its point of entry .",
    "this set of data is more noisy than the time - averaged one due to lack of averaging over time origins .",
    "it is , however , clear that this curve saturates at long times at a value higher than the saturation value of the time - origin averaged msd . also , the behavior of this curve near @xmath59 is different from that of the time - origin averaged msd .",
    "all these features of the results for the fixed time origin msd can also be explained from the random walk models discussed in the next section .",
    "another important quantity characterizing the dynamics of the confined water molecules is the survival probability of the water molecules inside the nanotubes .",
    "this probability was calculated using the definition @xcite @xmath60 where the summation is over all the water molecules and the angular brackets denote an average over the time origin @xmath61 .",
    "the survival probability was normalized to unity at @xmath59 by dividing the @xmath62 of eq.([surv ] ) by its value at @xmath59 .",
    "configurations saved at every @xmath20 ps interval were used in the calculation of this quantity . @xmath62",
    "defined above is the probability that a water molecule remains inside the nanotube for all times between @xmath61 and @xmath63 , averaged over the initial time @xmath61 .",
    "it is related to @xmath64 , the distribution of residence times of the water molecules inside the nanotube , in the following way . @xmath65 here",
    "@xmath66 is the total time of the simulation which , for all practical purposes , may be taken to be infinity .",
    "a related quantity , which is also sometimes called the survival probability , is @xmath67 , the probability that a water molecule that enters the nanotube at time @xmath61 remains inside the nanotube for all times between @xmath61 and @xmath63 .",
    "this quantity is related to the residence time distribution @xmath64 by @xmath68 which implies that @xmath69 . using this result in eq.([def1 ] ) , we get the following relation between the measured survival probability @xmath62 and the quantity @xmath67 . @xmath70",
    "if the residence time distribution decays exponentially with time at long times , i.e. if @xmath71 , then both @xmath62 and @xmath67 would also decay exponentially with the same time scale @xmath72 which would be the average residence time of the water molecules inside the nanotube .",
    "the survival probability @xmath62 obtained from md simulations for the @xmath22 nanotube is shown as a function of time @xmath2 in fig.[802709jcp5 ] in a semi - log plot .",
    "it is clear from the plot that @xmath62 decays exponentially with @xmath2 at long times .",
    "this data is calculated from a simulation which ran for @xmath29 ns . results for the @xmath1 tube also show similar behavior .",
    "the value of the time constant @xmath72 ( the average residence time ) is @xmath73 ps for the @xmath1 tube and @xmath74 ps for the @xmath22 tube .",
    "these values are roughly proportional to @xmath75",
    ". the exponential decay of the survival probability and the quadratic dependence of the time scale @xmath72 on the length of the nanotube are both consistent with normal mode diffusion of the water molecules inside the nanotube .",
    "this is explained in detail in the next section .",
    "due to the very high degree of correlation among the positions and displacements of the confined water molecules demonstrated in the preceding section , it is reasonable to form the following approximate description of the dynamics of the water molecules inside the nanotube : the group of water molecules , each separated from its neighbors by the inter - particle spacing @xmath76 , form a `` solid '' object of size comparable to the length @xmath10 of the nanotube .",
    "this group of strongly correlated molecules moves back and forth along the tube , randomly kicked by water molecules from the bath if it happens to be near an end of the tube .",
    "if one of the molecules in this group goes out of the tube , another one enters the tube within a short time , keeping the total number of molecules inside the tube roughly constant in time . hence the motion of this group of molecules",
    "can be described as a one - dimensional random walk of a single `` effective '' particle on a line segment of length @xmath10 .",
    "since we consider the dynamics of the water molecules only during the time they spend inside the nanotube ( a molecule that goes out of the nanotube becomes a part of the bath and is not considered in our calculations ) , the one - dimensional random walk has absorbing boundaries at the two end of the tube ( @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) .",
    "the time @xmath2 is a continuous variable here .",
    "hence we call this model a continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) .",
    "all the results pertaining to this model can be calculated analytically .",
    "we have also considered a discrete time random walk ( dtrw ) model ( see below ) for which results were obtained from monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .    the diffusion equation for the quantity @xmath79 , the probability of finding the particle at @xmath21 at time @xmath2 , given that the particle was at @xmath80 at the initial time @xmath81 , is given by , @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the diffusion constant .",

    "\\label{st}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the survival probability @xmath62 measured in our md simulations may be obtained by combining this with eq.([def3 ] ) .",
    "we have used these analytic expressions to calculate all the dynamical quantities measured in the md simulations .",
    "the input parameters required for comparing the results from the random walk model with those obtained from md simulations are the diffusion constant , @xmath83 of the water molecules inside the nanotube and @xmath80 , the position of a water molecule at time @xmath59 , i.e. at the moment it comes inside the nanotube .",
    "we used the value of @xmath83 estimated from the slope of the msd versus time curve near the origin .",
    "the value of @xmath80 used in the calculation is the mean of the starting coordinate of a water molecules inside the nanotube , measured from the end through which it enters the tube . in making a comparison of the analytic results for the ctrw model with those obtained from md simulations",
    ", one should keep in mind the fact that the positions of the water molecules are measured at discrete intervals of 1 ps in the simulations .",
    "it is known from earlier studies of similar problems ( see , for example , ref.@xcite ) that this discrete sampling can make the results for dynamical quantities significantly different from those obtained from a continuous - time description .",
    "the difference in the present case arises from the fact that events in which a water molecule goes out of the tube and re - enters it between two successive measurements of its position ( which are separated by 1 ps ) are not detected in the discrete sampling .",
    "this makes values of the msd and the survival probability obtained from discrete sampling higher than those calculated for the continuous time model .    to examine the effects of discrete sampling , we have used mc simulations to study the dynamics of a random walk model in which a particle , initially at @xmath91 , performs a dtrw in which the length of each step is a gaussian random variable with zero mean and variance equal to @xmath92 , where @xmath83 is the diffusion constant obtained from our md simulation and @xmath93 ps , the time between two successive measurements of the particle position in the md simulation .",
    "the time in the dtrw model is defined as @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the number of steps taken by the particle .",
    "the mc simulations were carried out with absorbing boundary conditions at @xmath77 and @xmath78 , and all dynamical quantities were measured using the same methods as those in the md simulation .",
    "the results obtained for the ctrw and dtrw models compare well with those obtained from our md simulations .",
    "a comparison of the results for the msd is shown in fig . [ 802709jcp4 ] in which the top panel shows the time - origin averaged msd , and the bottom panel shows the msd with fixed time origin .",
    "the data obtained from the dtrw model are denoted by the dashed curve , whereas the analytic results from the ctrw model are denoted by the dash - dotted curve . while both the random walk models reproduce all the features of the md data , the agreement is better for the dtrw results , as expected . as in md simulations ,",
    "the msd saturates at long times and the value of the msd at saturation depends on the length @xmath10 of the tube . for the time - origin",
    "averaged msd , the analytic ctrw model predicts that the saturation occurs when @xmath96 , whereas the msd with a fixed time origin saturates at @xmath97 .",
    "this and other differences between the md results for the two msds are correctly reproduced by the random walk models .",
    "similar agreement between md and random walk results is also found for the @xmath1 nanotube .",
    "results for the survival probability @xmath62 for the @xmath22 nanotube are compared in figure [ 802709jcp5 ] . as expected ,",
    "the dtrw results for the survival probability are slightly higher than the ctrw results .",
    "both of these show exponential decay at long times . for the ctrw model , the time scale @xmath98 , since the term corresponding to @xmath99 in eq.([st ] )",
    "dominates at large @xmath2 .",
    "this gives @xmath100 ps for the @xmath101 tube .",
    "the numerical result for @xmath72 obtained for the dtrw model is @xmath102 ps .",
    "these values are in fair agreement with the result ( @xmath103 ps ) of our md simulation .",
    "the results for @xmath72 for the @xmath104 nanotube are : 84 ps ( ctrw ) , @xmath105 ps ( dtrw ) and @xmath73 ps ( md ) .",
    "the random walk results for @xmath72 show a slight departure from the expected @xmath75-dependence because the values of @xmath83 used for the two values of @xmath10 are slightly different .",
    "given the extreme simplicity of the random walk models , the agreement between the random walk and md results for the survival probability may be considered quite satisfactory . the agreement between the model and simulation results for the msd is better than that for the survival probability .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that the details of the complicated process of water molecules entering and exiting the nanotube , which are completely neglected in the random walk model , affect the survival probability more than the msd .",
    "it is clear from the results discussed above that the simple one - dimensional random walk models provide a good description of all the dynamical features found in our md simulations . from this observation ,",
    "we conclude that the water molecules undergo normal mode ( fickian ) diffusion inside the nanotubes under the conditions considered in our md simulations .",
    "in summary , we have shown that the water molecules inside a narrow ( 6,6 ) nanotube of diameter @xmath9 are spatially ordered with a mean nearest - neighbor distance of @xmath36 . to mimic the motion of the spatially ordered chain of water molecules inside the nanotube",
    ", we propose a random walk model for the diffusion of a single particle in a finite @xmath20d channel .",
    "the msd calculated from this model agrees well with that obtained from the md simulations .",
    "this establishes that the water molecules undergo normal mode diffusion inside these short , open - ended carbon nanotubes even for the longest observation times .",
    "it is argued that the reason behind the observation that the water molecules undergo normal - mode diffusion and not sub - diffusion , as the geometric constraints would have suggested , is the strong correlations due to hydrogen bonding between neighboring water molecules .",
    "we also measure the survival probability of the water molecules inside the nanotube from md simulations and calculate it from the random walk model .",
    "there is good agreement between the results from the model and md simulation for the time scale ( average residence time ) of the exponential decay of the survival probability .",
    "this time scale is shown to depend quadratically on the length of the nanotube , which is another piece of evidence in support of the conclusion that the mode of diffusion is normal .",
    "our results have important implications for the possibility of observing single file diffusion in narrow channels of finite size .",
    "if the particles inside the channel interact with one another so strongly that they form a single strongly correlated cluster , then their mode of diffusion would be normal ( fickian ) instead of single - file even if the particles can not cross one another .",
    "this is probably the reason for observing normal mode diffusion in a recent md simulation @xcite of water molecules in a narrow carbon nanotube with periodic boundary conditions  the simulation shows that the water molecules form a tightly bound cluster inside the nanotube . to observe single file diffusion in such a system , the parameters ( interaction strength , temperature , length of the channel , etc . )",
    "must be such that the particles inside the channel form several clusters",
    ". it would be interesting to check , by simulations or experiments , whether a crossover from normal mode to single file diffusion occurs in such a system as appropriate parameters are changed to go from a situation in which the particles form a single cluster inside the channel to one with several clusters .",
