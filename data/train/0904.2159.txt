    "among the many properties of the dense medium that have been studied at rhic , the nature of jet - medium interaction has become the subject of particular current interest.@xcite jet quenching , proposed as a means to reveal the effect of the hot medium produced in heavy - ion collisions on the hard parton traversing that medium,@xcite has been confirmed by experiments@xcite and has thereby been referred to as a piece of strong evidence for the medium being a deconfined plasma of quarks and gluons.@xcite by the time of quark matter 2006 the frontier topic has moved beyond the suppression of single - particle distribution at high @xmath0 and into the correlation of hadrons on both the near side and the away side of jets.@xcite the data on dihadron and trihadron correlations are currently analyzed for low and intermediate @xmath0 , so the characteristic of hydrodynamical flow is involved in its interplay with semihard partons propagating through the medium .",
    "the physics issues are therefore broadened from the medium effects on jets to include also the effect of jets on medium .",
    "theoretical studies of those problems can no longer be restricted to perturbative qcd that is reliable only at high @xmath0 or to hydrodynamics that is relevant only at low @xmath0 . in the absence of any theory based on first principles that is suitable for intermediate @xmath0 ,",
    "phenomenological modeling is thus inevitable .",
    "a sample of some of the papers published before 2008 are given in refs .",
    "hadron correlation at intermediate @xmath0 involves essentially every complication that can be listed in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "first , there is the characteristic of the medium created .",
    "then there is the hard or semihard scattering that generates partons propagating through it .",
    "the interaction of those partons with the medium not only results in the degradation of the parton momentum , but also gives rise to ridges in association with trigger jets and to broad structure on the away side .",
    "those features observed are in the correlations among hadrons , so hadronization is an unavoidable subprocess that stands between the partonic subprocess and the detected hadrons .",
    "any realistic model must deal with all aspects of the various subprocesses involved . without an accurate description of hadronization , observed data on hadron correlation can not be reliably related to the partonic origin of ridges and jet structure .",
    "it is generally accepted that fragmentation is the hadronization subprocess at high @xmath0 , as in lepton - initiated processes . at intermediate and lower @xmath0 recombination or coalescence subprocess ( reco ) in heavy - ion collisions",
    "has been found to be more relevant.@xcite despite differences in detail , the three formulations of reco are physically very similar . in refs .",
    "[ ] the descriptions are 3-dimensional and treat recombination and fragmentation as independent additive components of hadronization . in ref .",
    "[ ] the formulation is 1d on the basis that acollinear partons have low probability of coalescence , and is simple enough to incorporate fragmentation as a component of recombination ( of shower partons ) so that there is a smooth transition from low to high @xmath0 . since the discussions on jet - medium interaction in the main part of this review are based largely on the formalism developed in ref .",
    "[ ] that emphasizes the role of shower partons at intermediate @xmath0 , the background of the subject of recombination along that line is first summarized along with an outline of how non - trivial recombination functions are determined .",
    "some questions raised by critics , concerning such topics as entropy and how partons are turned into constituent quarks , are addressed .",
    "more importantly , how shower partons are determined is discussed .",
    "large baryon - to - meson ratio observed in heavy - ion collisions is a signature of reco , since the physical reason for it to be higher than in fragmentation is the same in all three formulations.@xcite the discussion here that follows the formulation of the recombination model ( rm ) by hwa - yang should not be taken to imply less significance of the other two , but only the limits of the scope of this review .",
    "considerable space is given to the topics of the cronin effect ( to correct a prevailing misconception ) and to forward production at low and intermediate @xmath0 in sec .",
    "the large b / m ratio observed at forward production cements the validity of recombination so that one can move on to the main topic of jet - medium interaction .",
    "the two aspects of the jet - medium interaction , namely , the effect of jets on the medium and that of the medium on jets , are discussed in secs . 4 and 6 , respectively .",
    "in between those two sections we insert a section on azimuthal anisotropy because semihard jets can affect what is conventionally referred to as elliptic flow at low @xmath0 and also because ridge formation can depend on the trigger azimuth at intermediate @xmath0 .",
    "much theoretical attention has been given in the past year to the phenomena of ridges on the near side and double hump on the away side of triggers at intermediate @xmath0.@xcite-@xcite our aim here is not to review the various approaches of those studies , but to give an overview of what has been accomplished on these topics in the rm .",
    "the focus is necessary in order to cover a range of problems that depend on a reliable description of the hadronization subprocess .",
    "this review is complementary to the one given recently by majumder,@xcite which emphasizes the region of @xmath0 much higher than what is considered here , so that factorized fragmentation can be applied .    due to space limitations",
    "this review can not go into the mathematical details of either the basic formalism or the specific problems .",
    "adequate referencing is provided to guide the interested reader to the original papers where details can be found .",
    "the discussions will mainly be qualitative , thus rendering an opportunity to describe the motivations , assumptions and physical ideas that underlie the model calculations .",
    "for example , the shower parton is an important ingredient in this approach that interpolates between what are soft ( thermal - thermal ) and hard ( shower - shower ) , but we have neither space nor inclination to revisit the precise scheme in which the shower - parton distributions are derived from the fragmentation functions .",
    "the concept of thermal - shower recombination and its application to intermediate-@xmath0 physics are more important than the numerical details .",
    "similarly , we emphasize the role that the ridges play ( without triggers ) in the inclusive distributions of single particles because of the pervasiveness of semihard scattering , the discussion of which can only be phenomenological .",
    "attempts are made to distinguish our approach from conceptions and interpretations that are generally regarded as conventional wisdom .",
    "some examples of what is conventional are : ( 1 ) cronin effect is due to initial - state transverse broadening ; ( 2 ) large b / m ratio is anomalous ; ( 3 ) azimuthal anisotropy is due to asymmetric high pressure gradient at early time ; ( 4 ) recombination implies quark number scaling ( qns ) of @xmath1 ; ( 5 ) dijets probe the medium interior . in each case",
    "evidences are given to support an alternative interpretation . in ( 4 )",
    ", it is the other way around : qns confirms recombination but the breaking of qns does not imply the failure of recombination .",
    "other topics are more current , so no standard views have been developed yet .",
    "indeed , there exist a wide variety of approaches to jet - medium interaction , and what is described here is only one among many possibilities .",
    "in the 70s when inclusive cross sections were beginning to be measured in hadronic processes the only theoretical scheme to treat hadronization was fragmentation for lepton - initiated processes for which the interaction of quark were known to be the basic subprocess responsible for multiparticle production .",
    "the same fragmentation process was applied also to the production of high-@xmath0 particles in hadronic collisions.@xcite local parton - hadron duality was also invoked as a way to avoid focusing on the issue of hadronization.@xcite in dual parton model where color strings are stretched between quarks and diquarks , the fragmentation functions ( ffs ) are attached to the ends of the strings to materialize the partons to hadrons , even if one of the ends is a diquark.@xcite however , at low @xmath0 in @xmath2 collisions quarks are not isolated objects in the parton model since there are gluons and wee - partons at small @xmath3,@xcite so the justification for the confinement of color flux to a narrow string is less cogent than at high @xmath0 .",
    "a more physically realistic description of hadronization seemed wanting .",
    "the first serious alternative to fragmentation against the prevalent scheme for hadronization was the suggestion that pion production at low @xmath0 in @xmath2 collisions can be treated by recombination.@xcite the simple equation that describes it is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the @xmath6 distribution , taken to be the product @xmath7 of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 distributions already known at the time among the parton distributions of a proton . the recombination function ( rf ) @xmath10 contains the momentum conserving @xmath11 with a multiplicative factor that is constrained by the counting rule developed for quarks in hadrons",
    ". that simple treatment of hadronization turned out to produce results that agreed with the existing data very well .    the next important step in solidifying",
    "the treatment of recombination is the detailed study of the rf .",
    "if rf is circumscribed by the characteristics of the wave function of the hadron formed , then it should be related to the time - reversed process of describing the structure of that hadron . in dealing with that relationship",
    "it also becomes clear that the distinction between partons and constituent quarks must be recognized and then bridged  a problem that has puzzled some users of the rm even in recent years .",
    "since hadron structure is the basis for rf , it became essential to have a description of the constituents of a hadron in a way that interpolates between the hadronic scale and the partonic scale .",
    "it is in the context of filling that need that the concept of valons was proposed.@xcite    the origin of the notion of constituent quarks ( cqs ) is rooted in solving the bound - state problem of hadrons .",
    "however , in describing the structure of a nucleon in deep inelastic scattering the role of cqs seems to be totally absent in the structure functions @xmath12 , such as @xmath13 .",
    "the two descriptions are not merely due to the difference in reference frames , cqs being in the rest frame , the partons in a high - momentum frame . also important",
    "is that the bound state is a problem at the hadronic scale , i.e.  low @xmath14 , while deep inelastic scattering is at high @xmath14 .",
    "the two aspects of the problem can be connected by the introduction of valons as the dressed valence quarks , i.e. , each being a valence quark with its cloud of gluons and sea quarks which can be resolved only by high-@xmath14 probes . at low @xmath14",
    "the internal structure of a valon can not be resolved , so a valon becomes what a cq would be in the momentum - fraction variable in an infinite - momentum frame .",
    "thus the valon distribution in a hadron is the wave - function squared of the cqs , whose structure functions are described by pqcd at high @xmath14 .",
    "note that the usual description of @xmath14-evolution by dglap has no prescription within the theory for the boundary condition at low @xmath14 .",
    "that distribution at low @xmath14 is precisely what the valon distribution specifies . in summary ,",
    "the structure function @xmath15 of a hadron is a convolution of the valon distribution @xmath16 and the structure function @xmath17 of a valon@xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the momentum fraction ( not rapidity ) of a valon in the hadron @xmath20 . the first description of the properties of @xmath16 is given in [ ] , derived from the early data @xmath21 .",
    "more recent determination of @xmath16 is described in ref .  [ ] where more modern parton distribution functions have been used.@xcite    @xmath16 is the single - valon inclusive distribution in hadron @xmath20 , and is the appropriate integral of the exclusive distribution , @xmath22 for pion and @xmath23 for proton .",
    "more specifically , @xmath22 is the absolute square of the pion wave function @xmath24 in the infinite - momentum frame .",
    "once we have that , it is trivial to get the rf for pion ( i.e. , by complex conjugation ) , since it is the time - reversed process .",
    "thus for pion and proton , we have @xmath25 @xmath26 where the factors on the rhs are due to the fact that the rfs are invariant distributions defined in the phase space element @xmath27 , whereas @xmath28 are non - invariant defined in @xmath29 , as seen in ( [ 2.2 ] ) .",
    "the exclusive distribution @xmath28 contains the momentum conserving @xmath30 .",
    "for pion there is nothing else , but for other hadrons the prefactors are given in refs .",
    "[ ] .    having determined the rf , the natural question next is how partons turn into valons before recombination in a scattering process .",
    "let us suppose that we can calculate the multi - parton distribution @xmath31 for a @xmath8 and @xmath9 moving in the same direction , whether at low or high @xmath0 . if their momentum vectors are not parallel , with relative transverse momentum larger than the inverse hadronic size , then the probability of recombination is negligible .",
    "relative longitudinal momentum need not be small , since the rf allows for the variation in the momentum fractions , just as the partons in a hadron can have various momentum fractions .",
    "now , as the @xmath8 and @xmath9 move out of the interaction region , they may undergo color mutation by soft gluon radiation as well as dress themselves with gluon emission and reabsorption with the possibility of creating virtual @xmath6 pairs , none of which can be made precise without a high @xmath14 probe .",
    "the net effect is that given enough time before hadronization the quarks convert themselves to valons with essentially the same original momenta , assuming that the energy loss in vacuum due to soft gluon radiation is negligible ( even though color mutation is not negligible ) .",
    "for that reason we may simply write @xmath32 as multiplicative factors , as done in ( [ 2.1 ] ) , while treating @xmath33 as the distribution of partons and @xmath34 as the rf of valons .",
    "the detail of this is explained in ref .",
    ".    the question of entropy conservation has been raised at times , especially by those with experience in nuclear physics . in elementary processes , such as @xmath35 , unlike a nuclear process @xmath36 , the color degree of freedom is important . since",
    "a pion is colorless , the @xmath8 and @xmath9 that recombine must have opposite color .",
    "if they do not , they can not travel in vacuum without dragging a color flux tube behind them .",
    "the most energy - efficient way for them to evolve is to emit soft gluons thereby mutating their color charges until the @xmath6 pair becomes colorless and recombine .",
    "such soft processes leave behind color degrees of freedom from the @xmath6 system whose entropy is consequently not conserved .",
    "it is therefore pointless to pursue the question of entropy conservation in recombination , since the problem is uncalculable and puts no constraint on the kinematics of the formation of hadrons . besides",
    ", the entropy principle should not be applied locally .",
    "a global consideration must recognize that the bulk volume is increasing during the hadronization process , and thus this compensates any decrease of local entropy density .",
    "after the extensive discussion given above on the rf , we have come to the point of being able to assert that the main issue about recombination is the determination of the multi - parton distribution , such as @xmath5 in ( [ 2.1 ] ) , of the quarks that recombine .",
    "related to that is the question about the role of gluons which have to hadronize also . by moving the focus to the distributions of partons that hadronize , the investigation",
    "can then concentrate on the more relevant issues in heavy - ion collisions concerning the effect of the nuclear medium .      at low @xmath0 in the forward direction",
    "the partons that recombine are closely related to the low-@xmath14 partons in the projectile .",
    "it is a subject to be discussed in a following section . at intermediate and high @xmath0",
    "the partons are divided into two types : thermal ( t ) and shower ( s ) .",
    "the former contains the medium effect ; the latter is due to semihard and hard scattered partons .",
    "the consideration of shower partons is a unique feature of our approach to recombination , which is empowered by the possibility to include fragmentation process as ss or sss recombination .",
    "the jet - medium interaction is taken into account at the hadronization stage by ts recombination , although at an earlier stage the energy loss of the partons before emerging from the medium is another effect of the interaction that is , of course , also important .",
    "a quantitative theoretical study of that energy loss in realistic heavy - ion collisions at fixed centrality can not be carried out and compared with data without a reliable description of hadronization . at intermediate @xmath0",
    "there is no evidence that fragmentation is applicable because the baryon / meson ratio would be too small , as we shall describe in the next section .",
    "the fragmentation function ( ff ) , @xmath37 , is a phenomenological quantity whose @xmath14 evolution is calculable in pqcd ; however , at some low @xmath14 before evolution the distribution in @xmath3 is parametrized by fitting the data . with that reality in mind",
    "it is reasonable to consider an alternative way of treating the ff , one that builds in more dynamical content by regarding fragmentation as a recombination process . that is , if we replace the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ 2.1 ] ) by the invariant function @xmath38 , then the corresponding two - parton distribution in the integrand on the rhs is the product distributions of two shower partons in a jet initiated by a parton of type @xmath39 . to be specific ,",
    "consider , for example , the fragmentation of gluon to pion @xmath40 where the @xmath8 and @xmath9 distributions in a shower initiated by the gluon are the same , but their momentum - fraction dependencies are such that if one @xmath41 is a leading quark , the other @xmath42 has to be from the remainder @xmath43 of the parton pool . with @xmath44 being a phenomenological input ,",
    "it is possible to solve ( [ 2.5 ] ) numerically to obtain @xmath45 .",
    "it has been shown in ref .  [ ] that there are enough ffs known from analyzing leptonic processes to render feasible the determination of various shower parton distributions ( spds ) , which are denoted collectively by @xmath46 with @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where @xmath8 can be either @xmath49 or @xmath50 . if in @xmath39 the initiating hard parton is an @xmath51 quark , it is treated as @xmath8 .",
    "that is not the case if @xmath51 is in the produced shower .",
    "the parameterization of @xmath46 has the form @xmath52 where the dependence of @xmath53 , @xmath54 , etc .",
    ", on @xmath39 and @xmath55 are given in a table in ref .",
    "those parameters were determined from fitting the ffs at @xmath56 gev , and have been used for all hadronization processes without further consideration of their dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "it should be recognized that those shower partons are not to be identified with the ones due to gluon radiation at very high virtuality calculable in pqcd , which is not applicable for the description of hadronization at low virtuality .",
    "to sum up , in the conventional approach the ff is treated as a black box with a parton going in and a hadron going out , whereas in the rm we open up the black box and treat the outgoing hadron as the product of recombination of shower partons , whose distributions are to be determined from the ffs .",
    "once the spds are known , one can then consider the possibility that a shower parton may recombine with a thermal parton in the vicinity of a jet and thus give a more complete description of hadronization at intermediate-@xmath0 region , especially in the case of nuclear collisions .",
    "the spds parametrized by ( [ 2.6 ] ) , being derived from the meson ffs , open up the question of what happens if , instead of @xmath57 , three quarks in the shower recombine , e.g. , @xmath58 , or @xmath59 .",
    "a self - consistent scheme of hadronization would have to demand that the formation of baryons is a possibility in a fragmentation process and that the spds already determined should give an unambiguous prediction of what baryon ffs are .",
    "the calculation has been carried out in ref .",
    "[ ] where the results for @xmath60 and @xmath61 in gluon jets are in good agreement with data@xcite without the use of any adjustable parameters . to be able to relate meson and baryon ffs is an attribute of our formalism for hadronization that has not been achieved in other theoretical approaches , and provides further evidence that the spds are reliable for use at the hadronization scale .      in the study of shower partons in a jet",
    "we have assumed the validity of the approximation that the fragmentation process is essentially one dimensional .",
    "one may question whether the recombination process in a nuclear collision for a hadron produced at high @xmath0 may necessitate a 3d consideration , since two different length scales seem to be involved , one being that of the hadron produced , the other being the size of nuclear medium at hadronization time .",
    "indeed , recombination schemes formulated in 3d have been proposed , and various groups have independently found satisfactory results that are similar to one another.@xcite    the essence of recombination is , however , not in the 2d transverse plane normal to the direction of hadron momentum because if the coalescing parton momenta are not roughly parallel , then the relative momentum would have a large component in that transverse plane .",
    "if that component is larger than the inverse of the hadron size , then the two ( or three ) partons can not recombine .",
    "thus partons from regions of the nuclear medium that are far apart can not form a hadron , rendering the concern over different length scales in the problem inessential .",
    "only collinear partons emanating from the same region of the dense medium can recombine .",
    "for that reason the 1d formulation of recombination is adequate , as simple as expressed in ( [ 2.1 ] ) .",
    "if one asks why the relative momentum can be large in the hadron direction , but not transverse to it , the answer lies in the foundation of the parton model where the momentum fraction can vary from 0 to 1 , while the transverse parton momentum @xmath62 is limited to @xmath63 ( hadron radius)@xmath64 .",
    "the rfs in ( [ 2.3 ] ) and ( [ 2.4 ] ) are related to the 1d wave function in that framework .",
    "having justified the 1d formulation of recombination , let us now focus on the distributions of the recombining partons at low @xmath0 , and later at high @xmath0 . since pqcd can not be applied to multiparticle production at low @xmath0 , our consideration of the problem is based on feynman s parton model , which was originally proposed for hadron production at low @xmath0.@xcite in a @xmath2 collision there are valence and sea quarks and gluons whose @xmath3-distributions at low @xmath14 are known.@xcite without hard scattering their momenta carry them forward , and they must hadronize in the fragmentation region of the initial proton . rm has provided a quantitative treatment of the single - hadron inclusive distribution in @xmath65 not only for @xmath2 , but also for all realistic hadronic collisions.@xcite what is to be remarked here is how gluons hadronize . in an incident proton as in other hadrons , the gluons carry about half the momentum of the host . since gluons can not hadronize by themselves , but can virtually turn to @xmath6 pairs in the sea , we require that all gluons be converted to the sea quarks ( thus saturating the sea ) before recombination .",
    "this idea was originally suggested by duke and taylor,@xcite and was implemented quantitatively in the valon model in refs .",
    "the simplest way to achieve that is to increase the normalization of the @xmath6 sea quarks without changing their @xmath3 distributions so that the total momentum of the valence ( unchanged ) and sea quarks ( enhanced ) exhausts the initial momentum of the hadron without any left over for gluons . with",
    "the @xmath5 thus obtained , the use of ( [ 2.1 ] ) results in an inclusive @xmath66 distribution that agrees with data in both normalization and @xmath3 spectrum.@xcite using the appropriate valon distributions of pion and kaon , the success extends beyond @xmath67 to @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 in hadronic collisions at low @xmath0 . in nuclear collisions",
    "there is the additional complication arising from momentum degradation when partons traverse nuclear medium .",
    "it is a subject that will be brought up in sec .",
    "when @xmath0 is not small , then there has to be a semihard or hard scattering at the partonic level so that a parton with @xmath71 gev / c has to be created . in that case",
    "shower partons are developed in addition to the thermal partons , so the partons before recombination can be separated into the following types : tt+ts+ss for mesons and ttt+tts+tss+sss for baryons.@xcite the thermal partons have @xmath62 mainly @xmath72 gev / c . if one has a reliable scheme to calculate the thermal partons , then their @xmath62 distributions can , of course , be used in the recombination equation .",
    "it does not mean that hydrodynamics is a necessary input in the rm . in @xmath73 collisions , for instance ,",
    "hydrodynamics is not reliable , yet the cronin effect can be understood in the rm for both proton and pion production without associating the effect with initial - state scattering  a departure from the conventional thinking that will be discussed in the next section . in most applications reviewed here ,",
    "the distributions of thermal partons are determined from fitting the data at low @xmath0 , and are then used in the rm to describe the behavior of hadrons at @xmath74 gev / c .",
    "when we consider correlation at a later section , careful attention will be given to the enhancement of thermal partons due to the energy loss of a semihard or hard parton passing through the nuclear medium .",
    "it is only in the framework of a reliable hadronization scheme can one learn from the detected hadrons the nature of jet - medium interaction , as aspired in jet tomography .",
    "a well - known signature of the rm is that the baryon / meson ( b / m ) ratio is large  larger than what is customarily expected in fragmentation .",
    "the @xmath75 ratio of the ffs , i.e. , @xmath76 , is at most 0.2 at @xmath77 , and is much lower at other values of @xmath3.@xcite however , for inclusive distributions in heavy - ion collisions at rhic the ratio @xmath78 is as large as @xmath79 at @xmath80 gev / c , @xcite as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "thus hadronization at intermediate @xmath0 can not be due to parton fragmentation .",
    "three groups ( tam , duke and oregon ) have studied the problem in the recombination / coalescence ( reco ) model@xcite and found large @xmath78 in agreement with the data .",
    "the underlying reason that is common in all versions of reco is that for @xmath81 and @xmath66 at the same @xmath0 the three quarks that form the @xmath81 has average momentum @xmath82 , while the @xmath8 and @xmath9 that form the @xmath66 has @xmath83 .",
    "since parton distributions are suppressed severely at increasing @xmath62 , there are more quarks at @xmath82 than at @xmath83 , so the formation of proton is not at a disadvantage compared to that of a pion despite the difference in the rfs . for either hadron",
    "the recombination process is at an advantage over fragmentation because of the addivity of momenta .",
    "fragmentation suffers from two penalties : first , the initiating parton must have a momentum higher than @xmath0 , and second , the ffs are suppressed at any momentum fraction , more for proton than for pion . thus the yield from parton fragmentation is lower compared to that from parton recombination at intermediate @xmath0 , even apart from the issue of b / m ratio . when faced with the question why baryon production is so efficient , the proponents of pion fragmentation",
    "regard it as an anomaly . despite efforts to explain the enhancement in terms of baryon junction,@xcite the program has not been successful in establishing it as a viable mechanism for the formation of baryons.@xcite from the point of view of reco",
    "there is nothing anomalous .",
    "a simple way to understand the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath84 is to consider the 1d formulation of reco given in ref .",
    "[ ] , where the invariant distributions of meson and baryon production are expressed as @xmath85 @xmath86 in which all quarks are collinear with the hadron momentum @xmath81 .",
    "we assume that the rapidity @xmath19 is @xmath87 , so the transverse momenta are the only essential variables , for which the subscripts @xmath88 of all momenta are therefore omitted , for brevity . mass effect at low @xmath0",
    "renders the approximation poor and the 1d description inadequate .",
    "however , in order to gain a transparent picture analytically , let us ignore those complications and assume provisionally that all hadrons are massless .",
    "then the experimental observation of exponential behavior of the @xmath0 distribution of pions at low @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath89 , implies that the thermal partons behave as @xmath90 where @xmath91 has dimension ( gev)@xmath64 , and @xmath92 given in ( [ 2.3 ] ) is dimensionless .",
    "when thermal partons dominate @xmath93 and @xmath94 , the multiparton distributions can be written as products : @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively .",
    "it is then clear from the dimensionlessness of the quantities in ( [ 3.1 ] ) and ( [ 3.2 ] ) that with the proton distribution having @xmath97 dependence , as opposed to the pion distribution being @xmath98 , the @xmath75 ratio has the property @xmath99 so long as thermal recombination dominates .",
    "this linear rise with @xmath81 is the behavior seen in fig .  1 , although the mass effect of proton makes it less trivial in @xmath0 .",
    "nevertheless , this simple feature is embodied in the more detailed computation until shower partons become important for @xmath100 gev / c.@xcite    from the above analysis which should apply to any baryon and meson , it follows that the ratios @xmath101 and @xmath102 should also increase with @xmath0 in a way similar to @xmath75 .",
    "such behaviors have indeed been observed by star,@xcite as have been obtained in theoretical calculation.@xcite taken altogether , it means that without ts and tts recombination the b / m ratios would continue to rise with @xmath0 .",
    "but the data all show that the ratios peak at around @xmath103 gev / c . in the rm",
    "the bend - over is due to the increase of the ts component of the meson earlier than the tts component of the baryon , since two thermal partons in the latter have more weight than the single thermal parton in the former .",
    "the shower parton distribution @xmath104 in heavy - ion collisions is a convolution of the hard parton distribution @xmath105 and the @xmath106 distribution derived from ff , discussed in sec .",
    "2.2 , i.e. , @xmath107 @xmath105 is the transverse - momentum distribution of hard parton @xmath39 at midrapidity and contains the shadowing effect of the parton distribution in nuclear collisions .",
    "a simple parametrization of it is given in ref .",

    "we add here that the effort made to consider the shower partons before recombination is motivated by our concern that a hard parton with high virtuality can not hadronize by coalescing with a soft parton with low virtuality .",
    "the introduction of shower partons is our way to bring the effects of hard scattering to the hadronization scale . at the same time",

    "no other hadronization mechanisms are known to be able to reproduce the data on the large @xmath78 at large @xmath152 .",
    "so far we have considered only the physics at rhic energies and the recombination of thermal and shower partons , either between them or among themselves . at rhic high-@xmath0 jets",
    "are rare , so the shower partons are from one jet at most in an event . at lhc , however , high-@xmath0 jets are copiously produced for @xmath195 gev / c .",
    "when the jet density is high , the recombination of shower partons in neighboring jets becomes more probable and can make a significant contribution to the spectra of hadrons in the @xmath196 gev / c range , high by rhic standard , but intermediate at lhc .",
    "if that turns out to be true , then a remarkable signature is predicted and is easily measurable : the @xmath75 ratio will be huge , perhaps as high as 20.@xcite    if a hard parton of momentum @xmath62 is produced , shower partons in its jet with momenta @xmath197 are limited by the constraint @xmath198 , so that the recombination of those shower partons can produce a hadron with momentum @xmath0 not exceeding @xmath62 . however , if there are two adjacent jets with hard - parton momenta @xmath199 and @xmath200 , then to form a hadron at @xmath0 from shower partons in those two jets , neither @xmath199 nor @xmath200 need to be larger than @xmath0 , so the rate of such a process would be higher . furthermore , to form a proton at @xmath0 the shower parton @xmath197 can be lower than those for pion formation at the same @xmath0 , so @xmath201 can be even lower .",
    "thus @xmath78 in 2-jet recombination can be much higher than the ratio in 1-jet fragmentation .",
    "the probability for 2-jet recombination , however , also depends on the overlap of jet cones , since the coalescing shower partons must be nearly collinear .",
    "that overlap decreases with increasing @xmath201 , so there is a suppression factor in the ss or sss recombination integral that depends on the widths of the jet cones . using some reasonable estimates on all the factors involved , it is found that @xmath78 can be between 5 and 20 in the range @xmath196 gev / c , decreasing with increasing @xmath0.@xcite although exact numbers are unreliable , the approximate value of @xmath78 is about 2 orders of magnitude higher than what is expected in the usual scenario of fragmentation from single hard partons .",
    "the origin of the large @xmath78 at lhc discussed above is basically the same as that for forward production in @xmath133 collisions at rhic . in both cases",
    "it is the multi - source supply of the recombining partons that enhances the proton production . at large @xmath0 at lhc",
    "there are more than one jet going in the same direction ; at large @xmath202 at rhic there are more than one nucleon going in the forward direction . in the latter case",
    "we already have data supporting our view that @xmath78 should be large as shown in fig .",
    "it would be surprising that our prediction of large @xmath78 at lhc turns out to be untrue .",
    "in the previous section the topics of discussion have been exclusively on the single - particle distributions in various regions of phase space .",
    "everywhere it is found that the b / m ratio is large when @xmath0 is in the intermediate range .",
    "we now consider two - particle correlations , on which there is a wealth of data as a result of the general consensus in both the experimental and theoretical communities that more can be learned about the dense medium when one studies the system s effect on ( and response to ) penetrating probes .",
    "the strong interaction between energetic partons and the medium they traverse , resulting in jet quenching , is the underlying physics that can be revealed in the jet tomography program.@xcite to calibrate the medium effect theoretically , it is necessary to have a reliable framework in which to do calculation from first principles , and that is perturbative qcd . although many studies in pqcd have been carried out to learn about the modification of jets in dense medium in various approximation schemes,@xcite they are mainly concerned with the effect of the medium on jets at high @xmath0 , and the results can only be compared with data on single - particle distributions , such as @xmath203 .",
    "the response of the medium to the passage of hard partons is not what can be calculated in pqcd , since it involves soft physics .",
    "that is , however , the physical origin of most of the characteristics in the correlation data .",
    "an understanding of that response is one of the objectives of studying correlations . without the reliable theory to describe correlation , especially at low to intermediate @xmath0 where abundant data exist , it becomes necessary to use phenomenological models to relate various features of correlation .",
    "when all the features can consistently be explained in the framework of a model , then one may feel that a few parameters are a small price to pay for the elucidation of the jet - medium interaction .    on two - particle correlation",
    "the most active area in recent years has been the use of triggers at intermediate or high @xmath0 to select a restricted class of events and the observation of associated particles at various values of @xmath152 and @xmath204 relative to the trigger.@xcite among the new features found , the discovery of ridges on the near side has stimulated extensive interest and activities.@xcite we review in this section only those aspects in which recombination plays an important role , which in turn makes inferences on the origin of the ridges .",
    "we start with a summary of the experimental facts .",
    "the distribution of particles associated with a trigger at intermediate @xmath0 exhibits a peak at small @xmath205 and @xmath206 sitting on top of a ridge that has a wide range in @xmath207 , where @xmath205 and @xmath206 are , respectively , the differences of @xmath152 and @xmath204 of the associated particle from those of the trigger.@xcite a 2d correlation function in ( @xmath208 ) first shown by putschke@xcite at qm06 is reproduced here in fig .",
    "star has been able to separate the ridge @xmath209 from the peak @xmath210 , where @xmath211 refers to jet , although both are features associated with jets .",
    "the structure shown in fig .",
    "5(a ) is for @xmath212 gev / c and @xmath213 gev / c in central @xmath133 collisions .",
    "the ridge yield integrated over @xmath205 and @xmath206 decreases with decreasing @xmath214 , until it vanishes at the lowest @xmath214 corresponding to @xmath2 collisions , so @xmath215 depends strongly on the nuclear medium .",
    "that is not the case with @xmath211 . on the other hand , @xmath215 is also strongly correlated to jet production , since the ridge yield is insensitive to @xmath216 .",
    "thus the ridge is a manifestation of jet - medium interaction .",
    "putschke further showed@xcite that the ridge yield is exponential in its dependence on @xmath217 and that the slope in the semi - log plot is essentially independent of @xmath216 . that is shown by the solid lines in fig .",
    "the inverse slope parameterized by @xmath88 is slightly higher than @xmath218 of the inclusive distribution , also shown in that figure . since the @xmath0 range in that figure is between 2 and 4 gev / c , we know from single - particle distribution that the shape of the inclusive spectrum is at the transition from pure exponential on the low side to power - law behavior on the high side . the last data point at @xmath219",
    "gev / c being above the straight line is an indication of that .",
    "thus the value @xmath218 of the pure exponential part for the bulk is lower than what that straight line suggests .",
    "the exponential behavior of @xmath215 should be taken to mean that the particles in the ridge are emitted from a thermal source .",
    "usually thermal partons are regarded as begin uncorrelated . in the case of @xmath215",
    "they are all correlated to the semihard parton that initiates the jet .",
    "we thus interpret the observed characteristics as indicating that the ridge is from a thermal source at @xmath88 , enhanced by the energy lost by the semihard parton transversing the medium at @xmath218 .",
    "the b / m ratio of particles in the ridge is found to be even higher than the same ratio of the inclusive distributions in @xmath133 collisions at 200 gev . more specifically , @xmath220 in @xmath215 for @xmath221 gev / c and @xmath222 is about 1 at @xmath223 gev / c.@xcite in contrast , that ratio in @xmath211 is more than 5 times lower .",
    "there is indication that the @xmath224 ratio in the ridge is just as large.@xcite as discussed in sec .",
    "3 , it is hard to find any way to explain the large b / m ratio outside the framework of recombination .",
    "since the exponential behavior in @xmath0 implies the hadronization of thermal partons , the application of recombination very naturally gives rise to large b / m ratio , as we have seen in sec .",
    "putting together all the experimental features discussed above , we can construct a coherent picture of the dynamical origin of the @xmath215 and @xmath211 components of the jet structure , although no part of it can be rigorously proved for lack of a calculationally effective theory of soft physics .",
    "there are several stages of the dynamical process .",
    "( a ) : :    a hard or semihard scattering takes place in the medium resulting in a    parton directed outward in the transverse plane at midrapidity .",
    "because of energy loss to the medium , those originating in the    interior are not able to transverse the medium as effectively as those    created near the surface .",
    "that leads to trigger bias .",
    "( b ) : :    whatever the nature of the jet - medium interaction is , the energy lost    from the semihard parton goes to the enhancement of the thermal energy    of the partons in the near vicinity of the passing trajectory .",
    "those    enhanced thermal partons are swept by the local collective movement    outward whether or not the flow can be described by equilibrated    hydrodynamics initially .",
    "( c ) : :    since the initial scattering takes place at    @xmath225 , which is the pseudorapidity range of the    trigger acceptance , the shower ( s ) partons associated with the jet are    restricted to the same range of @xmath152",
    ". however , the    enhanced thermal partons that interact strongly with the medium can be    carried by the high-@xmath152 initial partons that they    encounter on the way out and be boosted to higher @xmath152 .",
    "thus the distribution of the enhanced thermal partons is elongated in    @xmath207 , but not in @xmath206    because the expansion of the bulk system is in longitudinal and radial    directions , not in the azimuthal direction .",
    "consequently , the    hadronization of the enhanced thermal partons has the shape of a    ridge .",
    "( d ) : :    in terms of recombination the ridge is formed by tt and ttt    recombination , while the peak @xmath211 is formed largely by ts    and tts ( or tss ) recombination , and possibly also by fragmentation ( ss    and sss ) , depending on @xmath0 and centrality . since the    @xmath211 component involves s , it is restricted to a narrow    cone in @xmath207 and @xmath206 .",
    "an initial attempt to incorporate all these properties in the rm was made in ref .",
    "[ ] before the ridge data were reported in qm06.@xcite by the time of qm08 ridgeology has become an intensely studied subject , as evidence by the talks in ref .  [ ] .",
    "although the properties of ridges described in the above subsection are derived from events with triggers , it should be recognized that ridges are present with or without triggers .",
    "that is because the ridges are induced by semihard scattering which can take place whether or not a hadron in a chosen @xmath0 range is used to select a subset of events .",
    "experimentally , it is known that the peak and ridge structure is seen in auto - correlation where no triggers are used.@xcite the implication is that the ridge hadrons are pervasive and are always present in the single - particle spectra",
    ".    hard scattering of partons can occur at all virtuality @xmath14 , with increasing probability at lower and lower @xmath14 .",
    "when the parton @xmath62 is @xmath226 gev / c , the rate of such semihard scattering can be high , while the time scale involved is low enough ( @xmath227 fm / c ) to be sensitive to the initial spatial configuration of the collision system .",
    "thus for noncentral collisions there can be nontrivial @xmath204 dependence , which we shall discuss in sec .",
    "hadron formation does not take place until much later , so it is important to bear in mind the two time scales involved in ridgeology .",
    "ridges are the hadronization products of enhanced thermal partons at late time , which are stimulated by semihard parton created at early time . in the absence of a theoretical framework to calculate the degree of enhancement due to energy loss",
    ", we extract the characteristics of the thermal distributions from the data .",
    "although hydrodynamics may be a valid description of the collective flow after local thermal equilibrium is established , it does not take semihard scattering into consideration and assumes fast thermaliztion without firmly grounded justification .",
    "if the semihard scattering occurs in the interior of the dense medium , the energy of the scattered parton is dissipated in the medium and contributes to the thermalization of the bulk ( @xmath228 ) .",
    "that process may take some time to complete .",
    "if the semihard scattering occurs near the surface of the medium , its effect can be detected as @xmath229 in these events selected by a trigger with the trigger direction not far from the local flow direction , a point to be discussed in more detail later in sec .",
    "inclusive distribution averages over all events without triggers , including all manifestation of hard and semihard scatterings ; hence , it is the sum of @xmath230 .",
    "since @xmath211 is associated with the shower partons @xmath231 , we identify @xmath211 with the recombination of ts+ss for the mesons and tts+tss+sss for the baryons , leaving tt+ttt for @xmath232 .",
    "thus the exponential behavior of the thermal partons is revealed in the exponential behavior of @xmath232 in @xmath0 , for which we emphasize the inclusion of the ridge contribution to the inclusive distribution .    in noncentral collisions the ridges",
    "are not produced uniformly throughout all azimuth,@xcite so @xmath233 that averages over all @xmath204 has varying proportions of @xmath228 and @xmath215 contributions depending on centrality . to be certain that we can get a measure of the @xmath215 contribution independent of @xmath204 , we focus on only the most central collisions in this and the next subsections . continuing to use the notation @xmath62 for the transverse momentum of the semihard parton at the point of creation in the medium , @xmath234 for that at the point of exit from the medium , and @xmath0 for the hadron outside",
    ", we have for thermal partons the distribution given in ( [ 3.3 ] ) just before recombination . our first point to stress here",
    "is that the inverse slope @xmath88 in ( [ 3.3 ] ) includes the effects of both @xmath228 and @xmath215 . putting that expression into ( [ 3.1 ] ) where one takes @xmath235 and being more explicit with the rf for pion in ( [ 2.3 ] ) , i.e. , @xmath236 one obtains@xcite @xmath237 although in 2004 no one was aware of the existence of ridges . from the data@xcite for identified hadrons",
    ", one can fit the @xmath238 distribution for 0 - 5% centrality in the range @xmath239 gev / c and get @xmath240 gev / c .",
    "this value is slightly lower than the one given in ref .  [ ] which takes the slope of the inclusive distribution in the range @xmath241 gev / c .",
    "[ ] provides data for @xmath242 and @xmath81 also , which have the same value of @xmath88 as above for @xmath239 gev / c , thus confirming that the exponential behaviors of the hadronic spectra can be traced to the common thermal distribution in ( [ 3.3 ] ) through recombination . at",
    "lower @xmath0 the spectra for @xmath242 and @xmath81 deviate from exponential behavior because of mass effect , which can largely be taken into account by using @xmath243 instead of @xmath0 , where @xmath244 @xmath245 being the hadron rest mass .",
    "thus we write for all hadrons @xmath246 where @xmath247 is a constant for pion , but for proton @xmath248 where @xmath249 is a numerical factor that arises from the wave functions ( valon distribution ) of the proton.@xcite note that the inverse slope is now denoted by @xmath250 , since the data@xcite show dependence on hadron type when the distributions are plotted as functions of @xmath243 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath251 is found to depend on centrality , which is a feature that can be understood in the rm as being due to the non - factorizability of the thermal parton distributions of @xmath252 at very peripheral collisions where the density of thermal partons is low.@xcite for central collisions , @xmath253 gev .",
    "we summarize the empirical results for @xmath66 and @xmath81 as follows : @xmath254 @xmath255 where @xmath256 denotes % centrality , e.  g. , @xmath257 for 10 % .",
    "we shall hereafter use @xmath250 to denote the inverse slope in @xmath243 for @xmath258 , and @xmath193 for that in @xmath243 for @xmath228 only , i.e. , @xmath259    it is hard to find data that describes the bulk contribution only , since the effect of semihard scattering can not easily be filtered out . indeed , as @xmath260 , there is no operational way without using trigger to distinguish @xmath261 from all inclusive .",
    "for that reason the prefactor @xmath262 in ( [ 4.8 ] ) is the same as that in ( [ 4.5 ] ) . in events with trigger above a threshold momentum , semihard partons with lower momenta than that threshold can contribute to @xmath215 ; it becomes a part of the background , which is experimentally treated as @xmath228 .",
    "thus the only meaningful way to isolate @xmath215 quantitatively is by use of correlation , while accepting the difficulty of separating @xmath228 and @xmath215 outside the momentum ranges where the correlated particles are measured .",
    "another way of stating that attitude is to accept the experimental paradigm of regarding the mixed events as a measure of the background ( hence , by definition , the bulk ) , and treating @xmath215 as only that associated with a trigger .",

    "[ ] by using the data for trigger momentum in the range @xmath268 gev / c that with @xmath269 mev in ( [ 4.10 ] ) the ridge distributions can be well fitted . the expression for @xmath270 in ( [ 4.9 ] ) has no explicit dependence on @xmath271 , as is roughly the case with the data .",

    "experimental exploration of the lower @xmath217 region would provide further validation that ( [ 4.9 ] ) needs .",
    "the physics basis for that distribution is the recombination of thermal partons given in ( [ 3.3 ] ) .",
    "we have discussed above the observation of ridge in triggered events , but to have a trigger from the ridge seems to put the horse behind the cart .",
    "there must be a phenomenological motivation for that role reversal .",

    "that is not possible with the light @xmath49 and @xmath50 quarks , but not impossible with the @xmath51 quark , since the heavier quark is suppressed in hard scattering .",
    "if one observes the hadrons formed from only the @xmath51 quarks , either @xmath204 or @xmath274 , one finds exponential behavior at all @xmath0 measured , which in the case @xmath274 extends to as high as @xmath275 gev / c.@xcite-@xcite the absence of any indication of up - bending of the distributions clearly suggests that the source of the @xmath51 quarks is thermal in nature and that no shower partons participate in the formation of @xmath204 and @xmath274 .",

    "indeed , the data can be well reproduced by tt for @xmath204 , ttt for @xmath274 , tt+ts for @xmath242 , and ttt+tts+tss for @xmath276 .    since @xmath51 quarks in s make insignificant contribution to @xmath274 production for @xmath277 gev / c , and",
    "since thermal partons are uncorrelated , it is reasonable to expect that the @xmath274 observed has no correlated particles .",

    "that prediction was falsified by a report at qm06 showing that there is a near - side peak after background subtraction in @xmath206 for @xmath274 in the range @xmath280 gev / c in central @xmath133 collisions with charged particles in the range @xmath281.@xcite the data created a dilemma : is @xmath274 created by a jet or not ? if it is , why is the @xmath0 distribution strictly exponential with no hint of jet characteristics ?",
    "if it is not , why is there a @xmath206 peak in azimuthal correlation ?",
    "the dilemma became known as the @xmath274 puzzle.@xcite    the resolution of that puzzle is in the recognition that both the trigger @xmath274 and the associated particles are in the ridge , first conjectured in ref .",

    "jets are involved , since without jets there can be no ridge .",
    "but not all jet structures exhibit a prominent peak above a ridge .",
    "it depends on the trigger particle and the ranges of @xmath271 and @xmath217 .",
    "consider the jet yield compared to the ridge yield at @xmath282 gev / c in @xmath133 collisions at 0 - 10% centrality.@xcite the @xmath283 ratio at @xmath284 gev / c decreases as the trigger particle goes from @xmath20 to @xmath285 and then to @xmath286 .",
    "for @xmath286 trigger and unidentified charged @xmath20 associated , the @xmath283 ratio is @xmath287 for @xmath288 and @xmath289 . since the @xmath286 trigger must contain an @xmath51 quark which is absent in the shower , the participating @xmath51 quark must be a thermal parton .",
    "for @xmath271 near 3 gev / c , thermal @xmath51 quark around @xmath290 gev / c or less can be quite abundant , and the initiating semihard parton need not be very hard . with @xmath217 as low as @xmath79 gev / c , the light hadrons in @xmath215 dominate over those in @xmath211 , so @xmath283 is small . as the strangeness in the trigger increases ,",
    "more thermal @xmath51 quarks are involved with less dependence on shower .",
    "@xmath283 is likely to be even smaller , although present data with @xmath274 trigger lack statistics to show the @xmath207 distribution .",
    "if the jet structure shows mainly a ridge with negligible peak @xmath210 in @xmath207 , we have referred to it as a phantom jet,@xcite i.e. , a jet - less jet .",
    "the corresponding @xmath206 distribution should then be dominantly @xmath215 .",
    "since the initiating semihard partons are either gluon or light quarks , the usual jet structure may still be seen if the trigger particle is ordinary .",
    "but for @xmath274 trigger the structure is very different .",
    "now , we can address the @xmath274 puzzle .",
    "the enhanced thermal partons generated by the semihard parton contain @xmath51 as well as @xmath49 and @xmath50 quarks .",
    "three @xmath51 quarks anywhere in the ridge can recombine to form a trigger @xmath274 .",
    "other quarks , in particular the light quarks , in the ridge can form associated particles .",
    "the pool of enhanced thermal partons are all correlated to the semihard parton in every event selected by the @xmath274 trigger , so the associated particles are all restricted to @xmath291 . since the @xmath51 quarks that form the @xmath274 are thermal , the @xmath274 spectrum in @xmath0 is exponential .",
    "hence the @xmath274 puzzle is solved .",
    "the trigger can be from the ridge .",
    "the above description outlines a detailed calculation of the @xmath206 distribution of charged hadrons produced in association with @xmath274.@xcite the background is calculated in the rm using previous parametrizations , and the height agrees with the data .",
    "that is important , since the ridge signal is less than 4% of the background height .",
    "two adjustable parameters are used to fit the @xmath206 distribution of the ridge , but then the yield / trigger is calculated as a function of @xmath271 without further unknowns in the model , and the result is in agreement with the data,@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "the solid and dashed curves in the two panels of that figure are the results of the calculation using two values of the strength of enhanced thermal partons that differ by only 1% , yet the height of the ridge varies by about 20% .",
    "that is because the ridge is the difference between large numbers of @xmath258 and @xmath228 .",
    "such accuracy is beyond the scope of any dynamical theory to achieve .",
    "the phenomenological approach adopted in ref .",
    "[ ] has been the only one that offers a quantitative understanding of the @xmath274 problem .",
    "recently , phenix has shown data@xcite that can be interpreted as support for the notion of trigger from the ridge . at @xmath292 gev / c ( for unidentified trigger ) the per - trigger yield of the associated particles is found to be less than expected from fragmentation , and the `` dilution '' effect is attributed to the increase of the number of triggers due to soft processes . in our language fragmentation is the ss component , and the ts component due to medium effect gives an increase already over fragmentation for @xmath277 gev / c .",
    "the additional dilution effect at @xmath293 gev / c is due to tt recombination , which is enhanced by the ridge contribution .",
    "so far our consideration in ridgeology has been concerned mainly with the dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "now , let us turn to azimuthal correlation , although our discussion of the main topic of azimuthal anisotropy of single - particle distributions is deferred to the following section .",
    "our present focus is on the correlation between the directions of the trigger and ridge particles in the transverse plane , a topic that can be discussed prior to @xmath204 anistropy because it is mainly a problem in ridge formation .",
    "the subject was stimulated by the report@xcite that the ridge yield depends on the azimuthal angle @xmath294 between the trigger angle @xmath295 and the reaction plane @xmath296 , even for nearly central collisions , but especially for noncentral collisions .",
    "since geometry is an important factor that influences the @xmath294 dependence , it is necessary to treat carefully the initial configuration of the problem : ( a ) the point of origin @xmath297 of the semihard parton in the almond - shaped overlap region , ( b ) the angle @xmath294 of the parton s trajectory , ( c ) the density of the medium , @xmath298 , along that trajectory , and ( d ) the point of exit from the medium . in the approximation that the medium does not expand very much during the time that the semihard parton near the surface traverses the medium , it is not difficult to calculate the path length , but it is much more difficult to calculate the energy loss that depends on @xmath298 . even if there is a reliable way to account for the effect of the medium on the semihard parton , there is no known way to translate that to the effect of the parton on the medium .",
    "the enhancement of the thermal partons that lead to the ridge particles takes time to develop , during which the medium expands .",
    "local flow direction depends on where the enhanced thermal partons are in the overlap , which evolves into elliptical geometry .",
    "each of the various parts of the process can be represented by a factor that can be expressed in terms of variables that have reasonable physical relevance . without entering into the details that are described in ref .",
    "[ ] we can outline the essence here .",
    "let @xmath299 denote the probability of detecting a parton emerging from the medium , where @xmath300 is the path length measured from the initial point @xmath297 to the surface along a straight - line trajectory at angle @xmath294 .",
    "let @xmath301 be a function that describes the correlation between the enhanced thermal partons along the flow direction @xmath302 and the semihard parton direction @xmath294 . finally , let @xmath303 describe the fluctuation of the angle @xmath204 of a ridge particle from the average flow direction . for fixed",

    "it is necessary to integrate over all @xmath297 .",
    "not every semihard parton included in that integration gets out of the medium to generate a particle that triggers the event .",
    "the ridge distribution per trigger is therefore normalized by the probability of the ridge - generating parton emerging from the medium @xmath307 where the integration is over the entire region of initial overlap .",
    "there is no explicit dependence on @xmath271 and @xmath217 in ( [ 4.11 ] ) , but the parameters specifying the different factors in the equation do .",
    "we leave the momenta fixed in the ranges @xmath308 gev / c and @xmath309 gev / c , as specified in the experiment,@xcite and focus only on the dependencies on @xmath204 and @xmath294 .    the most important factor in ( [ 4.11 ] )",

    "if @xmath315 is close to @xmath294 for most of the points @xmath316 along the trajectory , then the thermal partons enhanced by successive soft emissions are carried by the flow along the same direction .",
    "the effects reinforce one another and lead to the formation of a ridge in a narrow cone . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath314 is very different from @xmath294 , then the enhanced soft partons are dispersed over a range of surface area , so their hadronization leads to no pronounced effect .",
    "that is the essence of the correlated emission model ( cem).@xcite    the probability @xmath299 depends , in addition to the nuclear thickness at @xmath297 , the survival probability @xmath317 , which is exponentially behaved in @xmath300 .",
    "most of the semihard partons that can emerge from the medium are created in a layer near the surface . in ref .",
    "[ ] the thickness of that layer is set to be approximately @xmath318 . a more detailed study of that will be described in sec .",
    "the fluctuation distribution @xmath303 turns out not to influence the final result in any sensitive way .",
    "a pictorial description of the origin of @xmath313 dependence of ridge yield in cem is shown in the left panel of fig .  7 , where ( a ) @xmath319 and ( b ) @xmath320 in noncentral collisions .",
    "the trigger directions @xmath313 are represented by the thin arrows , while the flow direction @xmath321 are depicted by the thick arrows that are normal to the surface .",
    "when the two types of arrows match , the reinforcement leads to a strong ridge . in ( a )",
    "the matching condition is met where the density is higher than in ( b ) where the matching arrows occur near the top of the overlap .",
    "thus the former case for @xmath319 has higher ridge yield than in the latter case for larger @xmath294 .",
    "that difference becomes more drastic as the collision centrality becomes more peripheral .",
    "the results on the ridge yield integrated over @xmath204 are compared to the data in the right panel of fig .",
    "7 . in ( a ) of that panel the normalization is adjusted to fit the data point at the lowest @xmath294 and the shape of the @xmath294 dependence is adjusted by varying the parameter @xmath312 in ( [ 4.13 ] ) .",
    "the value determined is @xmath322 ; it corresponds to a correlation cone of half - width @xmath323 .",
    "the curve in part ( b ) of that panel for 20 - 60% centrality is obtained without any further adjustment .",
    "although the agreement with data is not perfect , the curve does reproduce the trend of steep descend , followed by a region of flatness or even a small up - bending .",
    "the behavior at large @xmath294 is due to the additional contribution of semihard partons from the left - half ellipse at high @xmath324 .    without being integrated over @xmath204 ,",
    "the ridge distribution @xmath325 given by ( [ 4.11 ] ) and ( [ 4.12 ] ) describes the dependence of the ridge yield on @xmath326 .",

    "the reason for the asymmetry in fig .",
    "8(a ) is that for @xmath328 most of the points along the trajectory have @xmath329 , since @xmath321 is generally normal to the surface .",
    "hence , the ridge particles are mostly at @xmath330 .",
    "the reverse is true for @xmath331 . the left shift of the peaks in @xmath206 in fig .",
    "8(a ) has been confirmed by star recently.@xcite    another way to test the asymmetry is to measure a quantity @xmath332 called inside - outside asymmetry function.@xcite to that end , define for @xmath333 @xmath334 and for @xmath335 reverse the definition .",
    "then for any @xmath313 define @xmath336 this asymmetry function should always be positive whether there is a left shift for @xmath331 or a right shift for @xmath328 . by reflection symmetry it vanishes at @xmath337 and @xmath338 . in cem",
    "the properties of @xmath339 at two centralities are shown in fig .",
    "star reported very recently at qm09 that such an asymmetry has indeed been found to exist in the data on the ridges for various @xmath313.@xcite",
    "the azimuthal dependence of single - particle distribution has been studied ever since the beginning of heavy - ion physics.@xcite-@xcite hydrodynamical model at low @xmath0@xcite-@xcite and reco at intermediate @xmath0@xcite have been able to describe the data on elliptic flow very well .",
    "the only points worthy of comments here are those outside the realm of what has been covered in the references given above .",
    "there are then only three points : ( a ) is early thermalization necessary ?",
    "( b ) what is the role of the shower partons ? ( c ) at what @xmath0 does the quark number scaling begin to break down ?",
    "the usual hydrodynamical treatment of elliptic flow assumes rapid thermalization with initial time of expansion set at @xmath340 fm / c .",
    "such an early time of equilibration has never been shown to be the consequence of any dynamical process that is firmly grounded and commonly accepted .",
    "the question then is whether the azimuthal anisotropy can be driven initially not by pressure gradient at @xmath341 fm / c , but by some other mechanism that is sensitive to the early spatial configuration .",
    "that mechanism is suggested in ref .",
    "[ ] to be semihard scattering , the rate of which can be high for parton @xmath62 around 2 - 3 gev / c , while the time scale involved is low ( @xmath227 fm / c ) .",
    "semihard partons created near the surface of the nuclear overlap can lead to a continuous range of ridges that is shaped by the initial geometry .",
    "the effects of such ridges are not considered in the usual studies in hydrodynamics , but should not be ignored .",
    "it is shown in refs .",
    "[ ] that the azimuthal anisotropy of the ridges produces the observed @xmath342 at low @xmath0 without the use of hydrodynamics .",
    "elliptic flow at some point of the expansion of the system may well be describable by hydrodynamics , but early thermalization is not required .    for @xmath343 of single - particle distribution , no triggers are used and ridges are generated by many semihard partons produced in each event .",
    "semihard scatterings take place throughout the overlap , but only those occurring near the surface and directed normal to the surface can lead to the development of ridges , as discussed in sec .  4.4 .",
    "if a drastic simplification is made to require ridge particles to be also directed only in the the directions normal to the almond - shaped initial boundary in the transverse plane , then the @xmath204 distribution of all ridges , @xmath344 , is restricted to the region @xmath345 , which is a set of angles defined by @xmath346 where @xmath347.@xcite fluctuation from the restricted range is , of course , possible , not only because the semihard partons can have any scattered angle , but also because the ridge particles can fluctuate from the directions of the parton trajectories .",
    "it is shown in the appendix of ref .",
    "[ ] that the region @xmath348 is nevertheless a good approximation even when all those effects plus elliptic geometry are taken into account , provided that the inaccuracy in the regions around @xmath349 for noncentral collisions is unimportant  which is indeed the case , since the density at the upper and lower tips of the ellipse is low so ridge production there is suppressed .",
    "thus in the box approximation the ridge distribution is @xmath350 where @xmath351 in the assumption that the above anisotropy from the ridge is the only @xmath204 dependence in @xmath343 , replacing the usual assumption of rapid thermalization and the consequent pressure gradient , the bulk medium is then isotropic and the single - particle distribution at low @xmath0 can be written in the form @xmath352 the normalized second harmonic in @xmath204 can then be calculated analytically , yielding @xmath353 at low @xmath0 the first term in the denominator is much larger than the second , so ( [ 5.5 ] ) is reduced to the even simpler formula @xmath354 this is such a compact formula that its validity should be checked regardless of its derivation for the sake of having available a simple description of what is usually called elliptic flow after extensive computation .",
    "the @xmath0 distributions of @xmath261 and @xmath355 are given , respectively , in ( [ 4.8 ] ) and ( [ 4.9 ] ) .",
    "the latter can be written in a form that factors out @xmath261 so that @xmath356 has the simple form @xmath357 which becomes @xmath358 at low @xmath0 , since @xmath359 is large .",
    "it then follows from ( [ 5.6 ] ) that for small @xmath243 @xmath360 thus the initial slope in @xmath243 depends only on @xmath359 ( which sets the scale ) and the geometric factor @xmath361 .",
    "that factorizability is in agreement with the data for pion , but not so well for proton for mid - central to peripheral collisions .",

    "the results for @xmath66 and @xmath81 are shown in fig .  9 , and reproduce the data@xcite very well .",
    "the reason why @xmath369 decreases with increasing peripherality , resulting in similar trend in @xmath366 , is that 3-quark recombination is more difficult when the thermal partons become less abundant at lower medium density as the collisions get more peripheral . at fixed @xmath370 gev",

    "[ ] in which it is shown that the characteristics of the data are well captured by the simple formula in ( [ 5.5 ] ) .",

    "their ratio @xmath524 is therefore approximately constant in @xmath81 with a value of about 0.8 as shown in fig .",
    "that behavior is similar to the property of @xmath525 , shown in fig .",
    "16(a ) , which , according to ( [ 6.18 ] ) , is also @xmath526 .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that @xmath527 and @xmath510 are averages over the two - particle distribution @xmath528 with @xmath520 , given in ( [ 6.16 ] ) for fixed @xmath113 , followed by averaging over @xmath453 , whereas @xmath529 , @xmath511 and @xmath530 are averages over the single - particle distribution @xmath531 , as noted after ( [ 6.18 ] ) .",
    "the near - side averages know nothing about the away - side analysis , so @xmath532 describes only the suppression associated with trigger bias .",
    "the fact that the suppression on the away side is about the same as on the near side , when the average @xmath533 is over symmetric dijets and @xmath534 is averaged over near - side jet , and that it is true for any centrality , has only one important implication : the dijets are created very near the surface on both sides .",
    "it means that the symmetric dijets are dominated by tangential jets , which behave similarly at all centralities .",
    "that is a striking conclusion .",
    "hard scattering can , of course , occur anywhere in the overlap region . but those partons from the interior lose most of their momenta on the way out .",
    "those that are created on the near side would not give rise to symmetric dijets .",
    "thus only those created along the rim and directed tangentially to the surface can lead to events with @xmath520 .",
    "there is some experimental evidence to support this finding . in 2jet + 1",
    "correlation studied@xcite it is found that the third particle does not show any ridge structure and that the centrality dependence goes as @xmath535 .",
    "the latter means that the dijets are created near the surface , while the former means that the dijets are tangential because we have already seen in sec .",
    "4.4 that ridge production depends on the local flow direction to match the trigger direction due to the correlation function in ( [ 4.13 ] ) .",
    "the flow direction near the surface is normal to the surface and is therefore normal to tangential jets . in the experimental analysis@xcite",
    "the two jets have @xmath0 cuts at @xmath536 gev / c and @xmath537 gev / c , so they are not exactly symmetrical .",
    "if ridge formation from those dijets is to be discovered in the future , it would pose a serious challenge to the treatment of ridgeology in sec .",
    "so far the data are in accord with the results both here and on ridges .",
    "the conclusion in the last section on the dominance in symmetric dijets by tangential jets leads one to consider the only option left for probing the dense medium by parton jets apart from using direct @xmath538 , and that is the study of away - side jets in unsymmetric dijets .",
    "if hard or semihard partons created near the surface are most responsible for the near - side jet , then the away - side jet should experience fully the effect of the medium .",
    "that is indeed the case when one calculates @xmath527 and @xmath510 for various values of @xmath466 and @xmath469 at fixed @xmath113 .",
    "it is found in ref .",
    "[ ] that for @xmath539 , @xmath524 is in the range of 0.15 to 0.3 for @xmath540 gev / c and @xmath541 gev / c , and gives a quantitative measure of the degree of energy loss . unfortunately , that can not be checked experimentally , since only centrality can be selected in realistic collisions , not the dynamical path length @xmath113",
    ".    at fixed centrality the value of @xmath113 can fluctuate over a wide range , as can be seen in fig .",
    ". for @xmath482 the average @xmath455 is 2.9 , but the characteristic of the away - side jet is dominated by the lower @xmath113 portion of the range .",
    "the consequence is that @xmath480 does not depend sensitively on @xmath466 , as fig .",
    "14(b ) has already indicated for any fixed @xmath256 .",
    "that is in sharp contrast from the case where @xmath113 is fixed at 2.9 , and @xmath542 decreases by an order of magnitude as @xmath466 is decreased from 9 to 4 gev / c at any fixed @xmath469 , as shown in fig .",
    "that diminishing yield is because @xmath512 is lower at lower @xmath466 and the energy loss by the recoil parton traversing the thick medium results in reduced probability of producing a pion at fixed @xmath469 .",
    "that is not the case in fig .",
    "14(b ) . at fixed @xmath256 ,",
    "the decrease of @xmath466 does not lead to significantly lower @xmath480 because the hard - scattering point is already in a region of lower @xmath113 to minimize energy loss . lowering @xmath466 increases the yield at fixed @xmath469 due to softer parton , but the number of triggers is also higher , so the yield per trigger remain nearly unchanged .",
    "in other words , allowing @xmath113 to be small even at small @xmath256 removes energy loss as a decisive factor in the problem . that is what makes dijet tomography ineffective as a probe to learn about a medium that has no fixed thickness .",
    "further insight can be gained by studying @xmath543 at fixed @xmath256 , where @xmath544 denotes the distance from the hard - scattering point to the away - side surface .",
    "19(a ) shows @xmath543 vs @xmath469 for various @xmath466 and @xmath256.@xcite a general impression from that figure is that @xmath543 is low , less than approximately 0.4 .",
    "that is much lower than @xmath545 , which is the average dynamical path length determined from fitting the single - pion distribution from @xmath482 [ see fig .",
    "the height of that distribution at large @xmath0 [ see fig .",
    "11(a ) ] is what renders @xmath546 , a number that pqcd calculations aim to obtain .",
    "the fit in ref .",
    "[ ] is achieved by setting @xmath545 in order to obtain the correct normalization for @xmath547 at large @xmath0 , for which the contributions from all partons , near or far , hard or semihard , are counted .",
    "the result that @xmath548 shown in fig .",
    "19(a ) is therefore indicative of the fact that conditional probability with @xmath466 and @xmath469 fixed is highly restricted compared to the inclusive probability . with @xmath549 being much less than @xmath431 at fixed @xmath256 , one is led to conclude that the unsymmetric dijets are also produced near the surface and are essentially tangential , as with symmetric dijets .",
    "thus the medium interior is not probed .",
    "this conclusion is distinctively different from the case where @xmath113 is fixed .",
    "16(b ) has shown that the suppression on the away side can be large ( hence @xmath550 small ) for unsymmetric dijets at @xmath539 . in that case",
    "@xmath543 would not be small , as we now have for any fixed @xmath256 .",
    "experimental data@xcite on slightly asymmetric dijets at high @xmath0 show no essential difference in the structures of the two jets and are in support of the findings in ref .",
    "another way to come to the same conclusion is to study the energy loss of the away - side jet . in fig .",
    "19(b ) is shown @xmath524 for @xmath482 and @xmath483.@xcite it is the fraction of average momentum retained by the hard or semihard parton after traversing the medium on the away side .",
    "being around 0.8 implies that only about 20% of the parton momentum is lost to the medium , not much more than the fractional energy loss on the near side . at fixed @xmath466 fig .",
    "19(b ) shows an increase of @xmath524 with increasing @xmath469 because the hard scattering point is pulled more to the away side , but it shows a decrease of the ratio at increasing @xmath466 since the point is then pulled to the near side .",
    "this push - and - pull effect of @xmath466 and @xmath469 is clearly what one expects in the oppositely - directed jets when the path lengths on the two sides are comparable . at the symmetry point",
    "@xmath551 gev / c , @xmath524 for @xmath482 is only slightly lower than its value for @xmath552 , implying strongly that the fractional energy loss on both sides remains about the same regardless of centrality .",
    "that can only mean that the hard partons are created near the surface and directed tangentially .",
    "making @xmath553 in unsymmetric dijets does not change @xmath524 drastically .",
    "thus so long as the medium thickness can not be controlled , there seems to be no useful tomography that can be done with parton - initiated dijets . if the away - side jets are dominated by those created near the away - side surface ( such as the tangential jets ) , then the events triggered by direct @xmath538 on the near side are also likely to be dominated by those where the hard scattering takes place near the away - side surface ( not just tangential ) so long as an associated particle with significant @xmath469 is required on the away side",
    ". the @xmath66-triggered and @xmath538-triggered distributions , @xmath554 , of the associated particles should be roughly the same .",
    "there is some experimental evidence for that similarity.@xcite    it is important to note that the above comment is for tomography only , i.e. , medium effect on jets .",
    "the jet effect on medium , such as mach cone , is a difference matter that depends on different physics and may well reveal properties of the medium interior .",
    "in this review many problems in heavy - ion collisions have been examined in many parts of the phase space . the good agreement between theoretical calculation and experimental data in almost all cases can not but affirm that the successes of the theoretical approach adopted can not be all fortuitous and that the interpretations given to the physical origins of the measured phenomena are not without some degree of realism . in some cases",
    "there are no apparent alternative schemes to explain the data .",
    "of course , a phenomenological model is not a theory based on first principles , but its usefulness should not be overlooked when its scope is out of reach by any theory commonly accepted .    in the first part of this review , mainly in secs .  2 and 3 ,",
    "we have summarized the essential basis of the recombination model , answering some questions raised by critics , and pinning down some of the parameters , while pushing the frontier to kinematical regions no other models have attempted , and establishing parton recombination as a universal hadronization mechanism . then in the second and main part recombination is used in an essential way to relate what are observed about jets and ridges to two complementary aspects about the dense medium : the effects of hard or semihard partons on the medium and the converse .",
    "those aspects of the medium effects can not be made empirically relevant unless there is a reliable description of hadronization for all @xmath0 where correlation data exist .",
    "some of the new insights gained that are of particular current interest are :    ( a ) : :    correlation between trigger and ridge ( sec .",
    "4.4 ) , ( b ) : :    independence of @xmath204 anisotropy on fast thermalization    ( sec .",
    "5.1 ) , ( c ) : :    recombination does not guarantee quark number scaling ( sec .",
    "5.3 ) , ( d ) : :    different properties of the near- and away - side jets ( sec .",
    "6.3 ) , ( e ) : :    dominance of tangential jets in symmetric and unsymmetric dijets    ( secs .  6.4 and 6.5 ) .",
    "if there is to be one unifying conclusion to be made as a result of these findings , it is that most observables on jets and ridges are due to hard or semihard partons created near the surface .",
    "partons created in the interior of the medium that lead to dijets are not able to compete effectively with those that have shorter distance to traverse .",
    "so long as the observables allow the parton creation points to include regions that offer the partons a choice of paths of least resistance , they will take it and dominate .",
    "that is the reality faced by experiments that can only fix centrality , not medium thickness .",
    "with that recognition the efficacy of jet tomography is called into question .",
    "unlike x - ray scanning of organic or inorganic substances , there is no control of the sources of the hard partons , so the necessary averaging process under - weighs the contribution from the region of the medium that one wants to learn most about .",
    "the above comment refers to parton - initiated dijets .",
    "of course , for single hadron at large @xmath0 the nuclear modification factor @xmath112 has long been used as a measure of energy loss in dense medium in experiments and in theory .",
    "as soon as a condition is imposed on the detector of another particle on the away side , the region of the system probed in changed .",
    "if that hadron s @xmath0 is low , it may be in the double - humped shoulder region , which does provide some information on what the effect of the away - side jet is on the medium . however , to learn about the effect of the main body of the medium on the jet from dihadron correlation is more difficult .",
    "ridgeology addresses a different set of problems , quite distinct from dijets .",
    "ridges are stimulated by jets , but are not a part of the jets that are characterized by the participation of shower partons .",
    "considerable attention has recently been drawn to the study of ridges . at this point",
    "there is no consensus in their theoretical interpretation .",
    "the connection between the ridges found in triggered events@xcite and those found in autocorrelation without triggers@xcite is in our opinion tenuous , until the @xmath0 dependence of the ridge is clarified .",
    "minijets@xcite peaking at @xmath555 correspond to @xmath556 gev / c , which is much lower than the @xmath0 range of the triggers used in ridge analysis .",
    "the ridge found in autocorrelation has no @xmath0 cut , while those found in triggered events have @xmath557 gev / c.@xcite nevertheless , there may exist a connection between autocorrelation and the ridges without trigger discussed in sec .  4.2",
    ".    another phenomenon of some current interest is the observation of extended ridge at large @xmath205.@xcite before one concludes that such a long - range correlation can only arise from the mechanism of strings ( or color flux tubes ) being stretched between forward- and backward - going quarks , it seems prudent to allow firstly the possibility of other types of early - time dynamics , and secondly a broader view of the problem of particle production at large @xmath558 . in particular",
    ", one should consider the role played by the hard parton that leads to both the trigger and the ridge .",
    "moreover , one should consider the issue of large @xmath75 ratio at @xmath559 ( see sec .",
    "3.4 ) as a part of the solution of the bigger problem .",
    "if the observed large @xmath75 ratio is a feature of the final - state interaction ( fsi ) , one should not regard the ridge phenomenon as a manifestation of the initial - state interaction ( isi ) only without taking into consideration also the effects of fsi . as we have noted at a number of places throughout this review",
    ", hadronization is an important link between the observables and partonic dynamics .",
    "the characteristic of ridge formation in azimuthal correlation discussed in sec .",
    "4.4 is a good example of the interplay between isi and fsi",
    ". it would be surprising if the same does not hold true for the correlation in rapidity .",
    "the considerations given in this review to jets and ridges may not be directly relevant at lhc where jets are copiously produced  unless @xmath0 is extremely high . at rhic",
    "the background to a rare jet is thermal , but at lhc the background to a high-@xmath0 jet , say at @xmath560 gev / c , includes many other lower-@xmath0 jets .",
    "the admixture of thermal and shower partons in the background introduces new complications to the notion of enhanced thermal partons , and renders what is simply conceived for rhic inadequate for lhc . that new energy frontier will indeed open up a wide new horizon .",
