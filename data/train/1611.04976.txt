    "requirements engineering ( re ) is a discipline that constitutes a holistic key to successful development projects as the elicitation , specification and validation of precise and stakeholder - appropriate requirements are critical determinants of quality  @xcite . at the same time , re is characterised by the involvement of interdisciplinary stakeholders and uncertainty as many things are not clear from the beginning of a project .",
    "hence , re is highly volatile and inherently complex by nature .",
    "although the importance of a high quality re and its continuos improvement has been recognised for many years , we can still observe industry struggling in defining and applying a high quality re  @xcite .",
    "the diversity of how re is performed in various industrial environments , each having its particularities in the domains of application or the software process models used , dooms the discipline to be not only a process area difficult to improve , but also difficult to investigate for common practices and shortcomings .    from a researcher s perspective",
    ", experimental research in re thereby becomes a crucial and challenging task .",
    "it is crucial , as experimentation of any kind in re , ranging from classical action research through observational studies to broad exploratory surveys , are fundamentally necessary to understand the practical needs and improvement goals in re , to steer problem - driven research and to investigate the value of new re methods via validation research  @xcite .",
    "it is challenging , because we still need a solid empirical basis that allows for generalisations taking into account the human factors that influence the anyway hardly standardisable discipline like no other in software engineering . in consequence ,",
    "qualitative research methods are gaining much attention  @xcite , and survey research has become an indispensable means to investigate re .",
    "although we are confident about the value of survey research to understand practical needs and to distill improvement goals in re , we still lack a solid empirical survey basis .",
    "the reason seems to lie in an ironically paradoxical circumstance : the appropriate design of a survey in re and the descriptive interpretation of the results going beyond purely observational , qualitative analyses and reasoning is very challenging , because we still lack empirically grounded theories in re  @xcite . in turn",
    ", we still lack such theories in re as we still have no empirically sound survey basis .",
    "available surveys in re either investigate isolated techniques in application , or they focus on a small data population ( single countries or companies ) so that the findings of the surveys are hardly generalisable  they can not be viewed as representative .    yet missing is a series of empirical investigations of practical problems and needs in re that allows for empirical generalisations to steer future research in a problem - driven manner .      as a long - term goal",
    ", we want to establish an open and generalisable set of empirical findings about practical problems and needs in re that allows us to steer future research in a problem - driven manner .",
    "to this end , we aim at conducting a continuously and independently replicated , globally distributed survey on re that investigates the state of the practice and trends including industrial expectations , status quo , experienced problems and how those problems manifest themselves in the process .",
    "we contribute the design of a globally distributed family of surveys on re and first results from its start conducted in germany .",
    "the survey will be replicated from 2013 on in a series of countries to manifest a clear understanding on the practical needs in re and the inference of practically relevant improvement goals .",
    "the remainder of the paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec : relatedwork ] , we introduce available contributions in the context of our research , which gaps are left open , and how we intent to close those gaps . in sect .",
    "[ sec : design ] , we introduce the design of the family of surveys , including the research questions , the used methodology and instrumentation , an initial theory ( to be extended during the replications ) , and the data analysis and validity procedures .",
    "the first results of the survey currently ongoing in germany are presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : results ] , before giving a concluding discussion in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we directly focus on empirical investigations in our area and delimit from any philosophical discussions , opinion papers or solution proposals ( see  @xcite ) of which several valuable ones exist",
    ". we can classify related empirical investigations into two major areas : investigations of techniques and methods , and investigations of general practices and contemporary phenomena in industrial process environments . in both areas , we find survey research as well as technical action research among case and field studies .    contributions that investigate techniques and methods analyse , for example , selected requirements phases and which techniques are suitable to support typical tasks in those phases .",
    "zowghi et al .",
    "@xcite , for example , conducted a survey about which techniques support the elicitation phase .",
    "a broader investigation of all phases is performed by cox et al .",
    "@xcite who analysed the perceived value of the re practices proposed by sommerville and sawyer .",
    "an exemplary survey on the choice of elicitation techniques is carried out by carrizo et al .",
    "studies like those reveal the effects of given techniques when applying them in practical contexts .",
    "another type of studies on techniques and methods is often driven by the objective of investigating the improvement of specific variables when applying different techniques in same or similar contexts .",
    "for instance , we investigated the effects two different process models in re had on the quality of the resulting artefacts ( e.g.  specification documents ) by performing technical action research  @xcite .",
    "abraho et al .",
    "@xcite raise the level of abstraction in this research area and set those kind of studies into the context of a framework that supports the validation of methods based on user perception while testing the framework with a family of experiments .",
    "in general , those studies give the opportunity to test the sensitivity of existing re approaches in an industrial context , but they rely on a problem domain explored in advance and focus on pre - defined improvement goals .    to reveal such industrial improvement goals and explore the problem domain to steer research activities , we mostly rely on field studies and surveys .",
    "one of the most commonly known survey is the chaos report of the standish group , examining , inter alia , root causes for project failures of which most ones are to be seen in re , such as missing user involvement .",
    "whereas the report is known to have serious flaws in its design negatively affecting the validity of the results  @xcite , other studies , such as the success  study , conduct a similar investigation of german companies including a detailed and reproducible study design .",
    "still , both surveys exclusively investigate failed projects and general causes at the level of overall processes . a similar focus , but exclusively set in the area of re , had the study of kamata et al .",
    "they analysed the criticality of the single parts of the ieee software requirements specification std .",
    "830 - 1998 on project success .    the focus of those studies , however , does not support investigation of contemporary phenomena and problems in industrial re environments .",
    "such investigations have , for example , been indirectly conducted by damian et al .",
    "they analysed process improvements in re and the relation to payoffs regarding , for example , productivity and the final product quality .",
    "nikula et al .",
    "@xcite present a survey on re at organisational level of small and medium size companies in finland . based on their findings , they inferred improvement goals , e.g.  on optimising knowledge transfer .",
    "a study investigating the industrial reluctance on software process improvement was performed by staples et al .",
    "they discovered different reasons why organisations do not adopt normative improvement solutions dictated by cmmi , such as no clear benefit and the relation to the company size .",
    "a field study with a broader data population of 60 cases in one company has been performed by enam et al .",
    "they could infer recommendations to practitioners , such as the involvement of users in the elicitation process .",
    "a more curiosity - driven study to analyse typical project situations in companies was presented by us in  @xcite .",
    "we could discover 31 project characteristics that directly influence re .",
    "a survey that directly focused on discovering problems in practical settings was performed by hall et al .",
    "they empirically underpin the problems discussed by hsia et al .",
    "@xcite and investigated a set of critical organisational and project - specific problems , such as communication problems , inappropriate skills or vague requirements , while those problems matched to a large extent with project characteristics we could discover .",
    "the previous non - exhaustive list of contributions reveals valuable observations when applying methods and techniques in sensitive , industrial contexts .",
    "another introduced type of studies being directly related to our contribution comprehends surveys that focus on the industrial status quo and problems in re .",
    "although giving valuable insights into industrial environments , those studies do by now not allow for generalisation as they focus on single aspects in re , such as problems in re processes or re improvements , or they focus on small subject populations ( e.g.  focus groups in single companies ) and , thus , these studies by now remain not representative .",
    "to close this gap in literature , we designed a family of surveys in joint collaboration with different researchers .",
    "the initial theory for the surveys relies on available study results as the ones introduced in the previous section and we expect it to change ( along with the variables ) over the years during replications due to an expected learning curve at us researchers .",
    "in addition , we present the first results from the survey conducted in germany and illustrate a replication outline beginning from 2013 in different countries . by bringing together different interdisciplinary communities , the survey shall build an empirical basis for empirical generalisations and problem - driven research in re .",
    "in the following , we introduce the design of the family of surveys . our overall long - term objective is to lay the empirical foundation to be continuously replicated in different countries .",
    "those surveys aim at a generalisable investigation of the state of the practice and trends in re including practitioners expectations , the status quo in re and its improvement , and contemporary problems experienced in companies .",
    "to support the dissemination of the results and the collaboration among the research communities , we provide a shared survey infrastructure relying on the same questionnaire , and we disclose the anonymised data to the promise repository .",
    "in the following , we formulate four research questions that build the frame for our surveys .",
    "afterwards , we design the overall methodology and introduce the instrument , i.e.  the ( typed ) questions and the categories , in sect .  [",
    "sec : instrument ] . in sect .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , we introduce an initial theory and our expectations we have gathered so far on basis of available literature , before concluding with the data analysis and validity procedures .",
    "we formulate four research questions to steer the overall design of the surveys shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : rqs ] .",
    ".research questions[tab : rqs ] [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     [ tab : problems - general ]    there , we received a more mixed picture of re in practice .",
    "on the one hand , six of the problems we offered were moderately agreed with by most of the respondents : communication flaws within the team and with the customer , incomplete and/or hidden requirements , inconsistent requirements , time boxing / not enough time and underspecified requirements that are too abstract and allow for various interpretations .",
    "on the other hand , two problems were disagreed with : weak knowledge of the customer s application domain and weak relationship to customer .",
    "the rest was considered mostly neutral or was moderately disagreed with .",
    "the deviations were mostly small ( 1 ) . in four problems",
    ", we have a deviation of 1.5 , which suggests a slightly higher diversity in the answers .",
    "accordingly , we could not find any large or significant correlation between the problems stated by the respondents and the answers selected in rq  1 and 2 ( e.g.  the relevance given to the artefacts and problems experienced w.r.t . ,",
    "inconsistency ) .    finally , we asked the respondents to rank the problems they have experienced according to their criticality .",
    "the most often mentioned problem in this ranking are incomplete and/or hidden requirements .",
    "also mentioned often are time boxing / not enough time and inconsistent requirements .",
    "the most frequent answer for how those selected problems manifest themselves in the process was change requests and additional effort ( e.g.  for meetings ) . when asked which of the selected problems they saw as a major reason for experienced project failure , the highest answer was given to incomplete requirements ( 8 times ) , followed by communication flaws with the customer ( 6 ) and and moving targets as well as time boxing each being selected 5 times .",
    "the results on project failures , however , do not yet allow for a clear interpretation as not all respondents selected problems .      the major problem with standards seems to be that they do not guide the requirements engineers enough how to create specification documents .",
    "also the integration with risk management is sometimes a problem but the deviations are higher and , hence , it seems to be different in different companies .",
    "the unclear terminology also receives some minor complaints .",
    "the picture is more mixed for general re problems , but there are also no overwhelmingly large problems .",
    "the classic re problems , communication , incomplete requirements , inconsistent requirements and not enough time seem to dominate .",
    "the application domain and the relationship to customers are in most companies not problematic .",
    "in this paper , we contributed the design of a global family of surveys to overcome the problem of by now isolated investigations in re that are not yet representative . with the family of surveys , we aim at establishing an empirically sound basis for understanding practical trends and problems in re and for inferring representative improvement goals . hence , the family of re surveys will build a continuous and generalisable empirical basis for problem - driven research .",
    "the family of surveys relies on an initial theory induced from literature , and it is designed in joint collaboration with different researchers from different countries .",
    "an additional pilot phase rounded out the validity procedures we could perform in advance .",
    "we presented the first results from the survey conducted in germany where 30 respondents of different companies participated ( with an answer rate of 29% ) and showed initial trends in re as well as problems the respondents experience in their practical settings .",
    "the first replication of the survey is currently performed in the netherlands and the synthesis of both surveys will be further disseminated to bring together the various empirical and re - specific research communities .",
    "further replications are planned from 2013 on by the researchers that already committed themselves to our undertaking .",
    "each replication uses the same infrastructure and is based on the same questionnaire while the interpretation of the results will be performed independently .",
    "to guarantee a reproducible design of the survey and of the results , we commit ourselves to disclose the anonymised data of each replication to the promise repository .",
    "the overall objective is to establish a regularly performed survey replication to continuously adapt and , finally , manifest a theory on the practical status quo and problems in re .",
    "based on our interpretations of the results w.r.t .",
    "the theory presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , we could confirm selected empirical findings available in literature .",
    "for example , our results indicate that artefacts still remain underrepresented in available company standards for re while the practitioners rate the definition of artefacts structures and contents in those standards to be important .",
    "furthermore , we could already confirm the general reluctance of practitioners against available normative re improvement standards , such as ones based on cmmi , which put the focus on assessing re standards against pre - defined processes and methods .    regarding the problems observed in the respondents project environments , we could rank the following as the most problematic ones : incomplete and inconsistent requirements , communication flaws within teams and with customers , and time boxing . while the first four ones relate to existing evidence",
    ", the last one is , to us , remarkable .",
    "we can directly derive two implications from our contributions .",
    "first , the results confirm a first coarse theory we draw on the basis of different isolated studies .",
    "this already allows researchers to steer their problem - driven research , i.e.  they can define improvement goals on basis of a survey that already goes beyond isolated investigations and validation research ; for instance , in the area of qualitative re improvement methods and/or in the area of artefact orientation .",
    "second , the family of surveys is and will remain open .",
    "this allows not only researchers to reproduce the results and their interpretation , but also practitioners to evaluate their own re situation against overall industrial trends .",
    "although we have first results from the survey conducted in germany and can be confident about the next replications , we are aware that the design has still limitations .",
    "most importantly and as already discussed , the initial theory is based on available contributions that investigate different aspects in re in an isolated manner .",
    "hence , the theory still needs to evolve and mature along with the variables in the instrument over the years during replications due to expected learning curves at us researchers , before we can finally establish a reliable and empirically grounded theory .",
    "we plan the further coordination of the replications , their synthesis and dissemination as future work .",
    "the dissemination comprehends both empirical and re research communities to support a variety of conceptual work in re on basis of empirical sound findings . to this end",
    ", we cordially invite further researchers to join in for further replications over the next years to establish a generalisable empirical basis on the state of the practice in requirements engineering .",
    "we want to thank all participants of isern and eessmod for fruitful discussions .",
    "in particular , we want to thank silvia abraho , barry boehm , giovanni cantone , michael chaudron , maya daneva , marcela genero , lars pareto , and roel wieringa for participating on the thematic workshops and giving us valuable feedback on the basic design of the family of surveys .",
    "furthermore , we want to thank the internal reviewers listed in tab .  [",
    "tab : review ] for their effort spent , and the external reviewers for their commitment to the whole undertaking . finally , we are grateful to michael mlynarski for supporting us in the pilot phase and to our project partners for their participation .",
