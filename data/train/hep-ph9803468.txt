    "the success of the standard model of particle physics has been spectacular , thus far !",

    "these models provide an intuitively attractive ( though presently disfavored ) approach to origin of ew symmetry breaking .",
    "a large fraction of this report is devoted to topics related to technicolor , topcolor and their variants .",
    "we give an overview of the technicolor models , their low energy signatures , the potential of the first muon collider ( fmc with @xmath5= 100 - 500 gev ) for direct searches and detailed measurements of these signatures . some comments on how these compare with what would be attainable at the tevatron , lhc and the possible nlc machines",

    "cross sections for production of some low mass technihadrons at a @xmath7 collider and their signatures were discussed by john womersley  @xcite . a model of technicolor with scalars and the prospects for discovering non - standard higgs - like scalars in the s - channel at the fmc were presented by bogdan dobrescu  @xcite .",

    "subsequently , dominici et al . , have also studied the production of such particles ( called pseudo - nambu - goldstone bosons ",
    "pngbs ) in the framework of the bess model  @xcite .",
    "* technicolor ( tc ) * is a new strong interaction of fermions and gauge bosons at the scale @xmath8 1 tev , which causes dynamical breaking of electroweak symmetry  @xcite .",
    "no elementary scalar bosons ( such as the higgs ) are required .",
    "technicolor model , in its simplest form , is a scaled - up version of qcd with massless technifermions that strongly interact at a scale @xmath9 1 tev and acquire a dynamical mass @xmath10 . the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken through technifermion condensation , producing three massless goldstone bosons .",
    "these goldstone bosons ( technipions ) have higgs - like coupling to fermions and correspond to the longitudinal components @xmath11 and @xmath12 of the weak gauge bosons . if left- and right - handed technifermions are assigned to weak su(2 ) doublets and singlets , respectively , then @xmath13 where @xmath14=246 gev is the technipion decay",

    "the top quark is very heavy compared to all the other quarks and leptons .",
    "this fact suggests that it might be strongly coupled to the mechanism of mass generation and to the dynamics of ewsb itself .",
    "it is conceivable that the top quark has unique dynamics .",
    "the simplest @xmath28 model has the following group structure :    g_tc su(2)_ew su(3)_3 su(3)_1,2 u(1)_3 u(1)_1,2 + g_tc su(2)_ew su(3)_c u(1)_y + su(3)_c u(1)_em where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the technicolor and electroweak gauge groups ; @xmath31 and @xmath32 are topcolor gauge groups coupled to the third generation fermions ( with stronger couplings ) while @xmath33 and @xmath34 couple to first and second generations only",
    ". technicolor causes most of the ewsb , while topcolor contributes only feebly with @xmath35 60 gev . the light quark and lepton masses",
    "are generated via etc dynamics which contributes only a gev to the third generation masses .",
    "the strong topcolor dynamics ( top quark pair condensate ) generates @xmath36 175 gev .",
    "the @xmath32 provides the difference that causes only top quarks to condense .",
    "thus , the top quark mass may be perceived as being generated by a combination of a dynamical condensate component , @xmath37 ( from topcolor dynamics ) and a small fundamental component , @xmath38 ( from _ e.g. , _",
    "technicolor ) with @xmath39 . a number of additional particles called `` top - pions '' @xmath40 and `` top - rho '' @xmath41 , are expected .",
    "the small etc component of the top quark implies that the masses of the top - pions depend on @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the top - pion mass induced from the fermion loop can be estimated as , m__t^2 = = where the pagels - stoker formula is used for @xmath44 . for @xmath42 = ( 0.03 , 0.1 ) , @xmath45 ( 1.5 , 1.0 )  tev , and @xmath23= 180 gev , this predicts @xmath46 = ( 180 , 240 ) gev .",
    "the bare values of @xmath42 generated at @xmath47 is subject to large radiative enhancements ( @xmath4810 ) by topcolor and @xmath49 .",
    "thus , we expect that even a bare value of @xmath500.005 can produce sizeable @xmath46 ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "the breaking of @xmath52 in the vicinity of 2 tev leads to eight color - octet vector bosons @xmath53 or @xmath54 ( colorons or top - gluons ) and an additional z boson , z@xmath55 .",
    "the mass of the z@xmath55 is expected to be in the range of 1 - 3 tev .",
    "the topcolor models have met with some problems in their implications for limits on custodial symmetry violation and other phenomenological constraints .",
    "the proximity of the measured top quark mass , @xmath56 , to the electroweak scale , however , suggests that ewsb may have its origin in dynamics associated with the top quark .",
    "an explicit realization of this idea is the top condensation mechanism @xcite , in which the top - antitop quark pair acquires a vacuum expectation value , much like the chiral condensate of qcd or the electron condensate of superconductivity ( bcs theory ) .",
    "the ewsb occurs via the condensation of the top quark in the presence of an extra vector - like , weak - isosinglet quark .",
    "the mass scale of the condensate is @xmath480.6  tev corresponding to the electroweak scale @xmath57 246  gev .",
    "the vector - like isosinglet then naturally exhibits a see - saw mechanism , yielding the physical top quark mass , which is then adjusted to the experimental value .",
    "the choice of @xmath48tev scale for the topcolor dynamics determines the mass of the weak - isoscalar see - saw partner .",
    "the model also implies the existence of pngbs .",
    "the lower bound on the mass of a pngb that couples to the top quark is less than @xmath23 .",
    "more work is needed to extend the scheme to generate masses and mixing for all quarks and leptons , and to construct attractive schemes for topcolor breaking .      in the minimal technicolor model , with just one technifermion doublet , the only prominent signals at the hadron and lepton colliders would be the enhancements in longitudinally - polarized weak vector boson production .",
    "these are due to the s - channel production of color - singlet technirho resonances near 1.5 - 2.0 tev and the subsequent decay into vector boson pairs ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) .",
    "observing these enhancements would be extremely difficult , since the @xmath60 production cross sections are small at such high technirho masses and efficiency for reconstructing vector boson pairs low .",
    "the non - minimal technicolor models , however , predict a rich spectrum of light , color - singlet technihadrons ",
    "the isotriplet vectors @xmath61 and their isoscalar partner @xmath62 , and pseudoscalars @xmath63 and @xmath64accessible at the tevatron , lhc and the fmc .",
    "( a search at the tevatron by cdf has been discussed later ) .",
    "since techni - isospin is likely to be a good approximate symmetry , @xmath65 and @xmath62 are approximately degenerate and so are the technipions .",
    "the masses are expected to be : @xmath66 and @xmath67  gev .",
    "the technipions with higgs - like etc couplings to quarks and leptons decay to the heaviest fermion pairs allowed .",
    "the isosinglet component of neutral technipions , @xmath64 , may decay into a pair of gluons if the constituent technifermions are colored .",
    "thus the predominant decay signatures of the light technipions would be :    @xmath68    the signatures for technirhos and techniomegas are as follows :    @xmath69    if the large ratio of @xmath70 significantly enhances technipion masses relative to technivector masses , then @xmath71 decay channels may be closed .",
    "if technicolor exists and technihadrons have masses low enough to be produced at the fmc , they will most probably be first discovered at the tevatron or at the lhc .",
    "an interesting aspect of the technihadrons is that several of them , particularly the neutral ones are very narrow .",
    "therefore , a @xmath72 collider which is expected to have very fine energy resolution is ideally suited for their studies .",
    "figure  [ fig : womer1 ] shows the production cross section for @xmath65 at a muon collider as a function of @xmath73 , for @xmath74=210 gev and @xmath75=110 gev .",

    "the peak cross section here is even larger , @xmath48 10 nb , that would provide an yield of @xmath80 events / year for the same luminosity .",
    "also , note that the peak is extremely narrow , with a width @xmath81 1 gev .",
    "the production cross sections decrease , if @xmath82 are heavier . for @xmath74=400 gev and @xmath75=150 gev ,",
    "the event rate is still @xmath83 events / year .",
    "the neutral technipions , like the sm higgs boson , are expected to couple to @xmath72 with a strength proportional to @xmath84 . in the _ ansatz _ of the non - minimal technicolor model with @xmath85 technifermion doublets ,",
    "the coupling is enhanced by a factor of @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , the fmc can serve as a neutral technipion factory with phenomenal rates for production in the s - channel , far exceeding those at any other collider .    once a neutral technipion has been found in @xmath65 or @xmath62",

    "limits have also been extracted for different cuts on cos@xmath224 .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ tab : keller2 ] .",
    "it is seen that the reach only improves by 10% in going from @xmath225= 0.8 to @xmath225=0.95 .",
    "so , it does not seem necessary to have detector coverage to very small angles .",
    "the new strong dynamics scenario for ewsb or for the origin of fermion masses can produce sizeable effects in low energy observables at energies much smaller than the scale of new physics .",
    "such effects in rare @xmath54 and @xmath226 decays have been studied by burdman  @xcite , in the framework of an effective lagrangian model .",
    "these effects in fcnc processes seem to originate from the insertion of anomalous triple gauge boson coupling vertices and four - fermion operators .    in the four - fermion operator scenario",
    ", it has been shown that branching ratios for @xmath227 can have large deviations ( up to a factor of @xmath482 ) from the sm expectations . however , no significant deviation is expected in @xmath228 decay .",
    "the effects are very similar in rare @xmath226 decays such as @xmath229 and @xmath230 .",
    "the effective lagrangian approach for non - sm couplings of fermions to gauge bosons has been examined in the topcolor class of theories .",
    "the presence of the relatively light top - pions , and other additional bound states , imposes severe constraints on the topcolor models due to their potential loop effects in low energy observables such as @xmath231 and rare @xmath54 and @xmath226 decay rates .",
    "these depend not only on @xmath232 and @xmath233 , but typically also on one or more elements of the quark rotation matrices necessary to diagonalize the quark yukawa couplings .",
    "so , it can be shown for example , for @xmath234 gev , the effect of a 400 gev @xmath40 in @xmath235 is an enhancement of more than 5% with respect to sm expectations .",
    "similar effects are expected to be present in @xmath229 .",
    "thus , the measurements of @xmath231 and the rare @xmath54 and @xmath226 decay modes can constrain strong dynamics models such as the topcolor model .",
    "we have reviewed various theories that currently offer to explain the breaking of electroweak symmetry dynamically .",
    "in particular , technicolor and related theories have been examined in detail .",
    "direct searches for signals of new strong dynamics as well as indirect tests for existence of strong dynamics , at the fmc , have been studied .",
    "long - range opportunities at the high energy muon colliders ( bmc with @xmath6=3 - 4  tev ) are examined .",
    "the experimental prospects for strong dynamics at the fmc can be summarized as follows :    * if low energy technicolor signatures ( extended walking technicolor , topcolor - assisted technicolor ) exist , they would be found at the tevatron or at the lhc . in this case",
    ", the first muon collider will be a remarkable facility to make detailed studies and precision measurements .",
    "the narrow neutral technihadrons@xmath236 and @xmath62would appear as spectacular resonances at the fmc ( @xmath5=100200  gev and energy resolution @xmath237 ) .",
    "one can operate on the resonance and study all the decays and branching fractions of the technirhos , techniomegas and technipions .",
    "we emphasize that the all - hadronic modes would be very difficult to study at the hadron colliders .",
    "* the good beam resolution achievable at the fmc with @xmath238 200  gev would enable studies of @xmath239 interference effects in detail , using fermion - antifermion final states . *",
    "a variety of other models such as technicolor with scalars and top see - saw model predict s - channel resonance production of new particles .",
    "muon collider has a big advantage over other colliders to discover and study these particles .",
    "* compositeness tests using bhabha scattering give reaches of several tens of tev at the fmc .",
    "at the big muon collider , the reaches for 95% confidence level limits on compositeness scale are unparellel , far exceeding the reaches possible at any other collider .",
    "the reaches would be of the order of 200 - 300  tev , at which scale we would be probing the structure of the dynamics that gives rise to fermion masses and mixings .",
    "* studies of rare b and k decays using the front - end of the fmc can provide tight constraints on strong dynamics and help distinguish between universal ( ewsb sector ) _ vs. _ non - universal ( flavor dynamics ) scenarios .",
