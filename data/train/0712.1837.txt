    "since the 1960 s , a large number of works has focused on the properties of solitons in the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation @xcite . as it is well known , the one - dimensional nls equation is integrable .",
    "two of the most important discretizations of this equation admit discrete solitons .",
    "one of these discretizations is known as the ablowitz - ladik equation @xcite , which is also integrable . on the contrary ,",
    "the other important discretization , known as the discrete nonlinear schrdinger ( dnls ) equation , is not integrable , and discrete soliton solutions must be calculated numerically .",
    "the dnls equation has many interesting mathematical properties and physical applications @xcite .",
    "the dnls equation models , among others , an array of nonlinear - optical waveguides @xcite , that was originally implemented in an experiment as a set of parallel ribs made of a semiconductor material ( algaas ) and mounted on a common substrate @xcite .",
    "it was predicted @xcite that the dnls equation may also serve as a model for bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) trapped in a strong optical lattice , which was confirmed by experiments @xcite .",
    "in addition to the direct physical realizations in terms of nonlinear optics and becs , the dnls equation appears as an envelope equation for a large class of nonlinear lattices ( for references , see @xcite , section 2.4 ) .",
    "accordingly , the solitons known in the dnls equation represent intrinsic localized modes investigated in such chains experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite . in this context",
    ", previous formal derivations of the dnls equation have been mathematically justified for small amplitude time - periodic solutions in references @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will consider fundamental solitons , which are of two types : sievers - takeno ( st ) modes , which are site - centered @xcite , and page ( p ) modes , which are bond - centered @xcite ( see also fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles ] ) .",
    "they can also be seen , respectively , as discrete solitons with a single excited site , or two adjacent excited site with the same amplitude .",
    "the dnls equation is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 are the lattice dynamical variables , the overdot stands for the time derivative , @xmath2 is the lattice coupling constant and @xmath3 a nonlinear parameter .",
    "we look for solutions of frequency @xmath4 having the form @xmath5 .",
    "their envelope @xmath6 satisfies @xmath7 throughout this paper , we assume @xmath8 and choose @xmath9 without loss of generality , as eq .",
    "( [ beq2 ] ) can be rescaled .",
    "we also look for unstaggered solutions , for which , @xmath10 ( staggered solutions with @xmath11 can be mapped to the former upon a suitable staggering transformation @xmath12 ) .",
    "furthermore , we restrict to real solutions of ( [ beq2 ] ) , which yield ( up to multiplication by @xmath13 ) all the homoclinic solutions of ( [ beq2 ] ) @xcite .",
    "homoclinic solutions of ( [ beq2 ] ) can be found numerically using methods based on the anti - continuous limit @xcite and have been studied in detail ( first of all , in one - dimensional models , but many results have been also obtained for two- and three - dimensional dnls lattices ) @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to compare four different analytical approximations of the profiles of st- and p - modes together with the exact numerical solutions .",
    "these analytical approximations are of four types : one of variational kind , another one based on a polynomial approximation of stable and unstable manifolds for the dnls map , another one based on a green - function method , and , finally , a quasi - continuum approach .",
