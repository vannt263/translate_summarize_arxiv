    "the polarization produced by the sun depends on both the orientation of the magnetic field with respect to the los and on its inclination with respect to the local vertical .",
    "g. , width=11 ]    why does the sun behave this way ? because we are dealing here with an astrophysical plasma composed of atoms whose excitation state is significantly influenced by the anisotropy of the pumping radiation field .",
    "the ensuing radiative transitions produce population imbalances and quantum coherences between the magnetic sublevels pertaining to the lower and/or upper levels of the spectral line under consideration ( i.e. , atomic level polarization ) , in such a way that the populations of magnetic substates with different values of @xmath4 are different .",
    "this is termed atomic level alignment .",
    "the radiatively induced polarization of the atomic levels produces selective emission and/or selective absorption of polarization components , which give rise to linear polarization in the emergent spectral line radiation even in the absence of magnetic fields ( e.g. , trujillo bueno 2001 , for a detailed review ) . via the hanle effect",
    "the atomic level polarization is sensitive to the presence of a magnetic field inclined with respect to the symmetry axis of the incident radiation field , so that it is natural to find in fig . 2 very different results for the vertical and horizontal magnetic field cases .",
    "what kind of stokes profiles would we observe if the magnetic strength were much lower ( say , @xmath5 g ) ?",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "3 , if @xmath5 g the circular polarization of the he i 10830   triplet is still dominated by the longitudinal zeeman effect , but the linear polarization is fully controlled by atomic level polarization and the hanle effect with no significant influence of the transverse zeeman effect .",
    "interestingly , this is precisely the situation we find in quiet regions of the solar atmosphere for many spectral lines , not only for the he i 10830   triplet considered in figs . 2 and 3 . an observational example is shown in fig .",
    "4 , which corresponds to high - sensitivity spectropolarimetric measurements of the ca ii ir triplet obtained in collaboration with r. ramelli ( irsol ) using the zrich imaging polarimeter ( zimpol ) at the themis telescope .",

    "quiet \" solar atmosphere allows us to explore its thermal and magnetic structure , but it does not provide information on numerical methods . such information can be found in several recent reviews . for the case of partial frequency redistribution ( prd ) , but assuming a two - level model atom with no lower - level polarization , see @xcite . for the case of realistic multilevel atoms with the possibility of atomic level polarization in all the levels , but assuming complete frequency redistribution ( crd ) , see @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , a general prd theory for modeling scattering line polarization with multilevel atoms is not yet available ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "nevertheless , the crd theory described in the monograph by @xcite is suitable for modeling the polarization observed in the sun s continuous radiation ( see section 2.1 ) and in many diagnostically important spectral lines , such as the he i 10830   and d@xmath9 multiplets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "can also be used for estimating the expected scattering polarization amplitudes in strong resonance lines for which frequency correlations between the incoming and outgoing photons are indeed significant ( e.g. , see fig . 8 for the case of ly@xmath11 in forward scattering geometry ) .",
    "however , it is important to emphasize that prd effects have to be taken into account in order to be able to provide reliable predictions on the shapes of the linear polarization profiles produced by scattering in strong resonance lines like ly@xmath11 and mg ii k. recently , @xcite have studied in great detail the sensitivity of prd scattering polarization profiles to various atmospheric parameters . to this end",
    ", the authors applied the very efficient radiative transfer method described in @xcite .",

    ". both types of observations ( on - disk and off - limb ) would provide precious information on the physical conditions of the solar transition region from the chromosphere to the @xmath130 k solar coronal plasma , even with a spatial resolution of only 1 or 2 arcseconds .",
    "radiative transfer modeling of solar light polarization is the essential link between theory and observations . in general ,",
    "realistic modeling requires solving a very complicated and still unsolved problem : non - lte , multilevel , prd radiative transfer , taking into account the joint action of the hanle and zeeman effects in 3d atmospheric models of the extended solar atmosphere .",
    "fortunately , the sun is subtle but not malicious : it allows us to learn how it works in a stepwise manner , while continuously motivating us to open up new research windows in astrophysics through the development of increasingly novel theories , instruments , modeling and data analysis techniques ."

    "<S> this paper considers the problem of modeling the light polarization that emerges from an astrophysical plasma composed of atoms whose excitation state is significantly influenced by the anisotropy of the incident radiation field . in particular , it highlights how radiative transfer simulations in three - dimensional models of the  quiet \" solar atmosphere may help us to probe its thermal and magnetic structure , from the near equilibrium photosphere to the highly non - equilibrium upper chromosphere . </S>",
    "<S> the paper finishes with predictions concerning the amplitudes and magnetic sensitivities of the linear polarization signals produced by scattering processes in two transition region lines , which should encourage us to develop uv polarimeters for sounding rockets and space telescopes with the aim of opening up a new diagnostic window in astrophysics . </S>"
