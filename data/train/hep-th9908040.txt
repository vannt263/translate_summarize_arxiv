    "it was observed by douglas and hull @xcite that d - branes on @xmath1 with a constant neveu - schwarz ( ns ) two - form potential @xmath2 give rise to an effective world - volume theory on a non - commutative torus .",
    "even though this initial observation was re - considered and generalized by many authors @xcite , all the subsequent work is restricted to flat backgrounds . a perturbative analysis along the lines of @xcite",
    ", on the other hand , shows that the quantization of world - volume geometries should be a much more general phenomenon which persists in the case of curved backgrounds .    in this work we shall present the first non - perturbative ( in @xmath3 ) investigation of world - volume geometries in a curved string background with non - vanishing ns 3-form field @xmath0 . by the string s equation of motion . ]",
    "an exact treatment of d - branes in curved backgrounds is possible within the framework of boundary conformal field theory .",
    "here we illustrate the basic techniques and some general features of the resulting world - volume geometries in a particular example , namely the su(2 ) wzw theory , and study d - branes in the wzw model associated with the gluing condition @xmath4 .",
    "we shall argue that their world - volumes may be regarded as fuzzy two - spheres when the level @xmath5 is sent to infinity , i.e.  when the background becomes flat . for finite level , @xmath6 is non - zero and we shall find non - associative deformations of these fuzzy spheres , which are closely linked to the theory of quantum groups . while the infinite level result can be predicted from the semi - classical analysis in @xcite together with the general phenomenon of world - volume quantization in flat backgrounds @xcite , our results on the finite level provide a non - trivial extension of the standard rules .",
    "apparently , many features of the world - volume geometry are not captured by the perturbative treatment of d - branes on group manifolds that was suggested recently in @xcite .",
    "we shall follow a general procedure which allows us to extract world - volume geometry from the world - sheet description of any ( generalized ) d - brane , even when it is given in purely algebraic terms .",
    "the essential input data are the operator product expansions ( ope ) of boundary fields ( open string vertex operators ) .",
    "since they depend on the ordering of the operators , it is not surprising that the brane world - volume obtained in this way is a non - commutative space , in general .",
    "we shall see that non - associativity may show up as well .",
    "our approach is inspired by a project initiated by j.  frhlich and k.  in @xcite ( see also @xcite for earlier ideas in the same direction ) , where it was proposed to construct non - commutative target space geometries from opes of closed string vertex operators .",
    "this was developed further in @xcite .",
    "it appears , however , that non - commutative geometry emerges in a more natural way and on a more fundamental level in the open string case , cf .",
    "the picture below .",
    "our findings add to the growing evidence that brane physics surpasses classical geometry  even though the emergence of a non - commutative world - volume need not necessarily mean that a d - brane behaves non - geometrically in the sense of the criterion formulated in @xcite .",
    "this criterion rests on a comparison of low - energy effective field theories in the stringy and in the large - volume regime , and we do not attempt to test it in the present paper .",
    "but we would like to point out that the structures contained in the non - commutative world - volume also form the main ingredient of the effective action of the brane .    while we have chosen the su(2)@xmath7 example mainly because of its simplicity and because there exists a semi - classical curved background picture ,",
    "it is also an important ingredient of the cft formulation of the neveu - schwarz 5-brane , see e.g.  @xcite . given that questions like stability of the configuration can be clarified , our findings should be relevant for the geometry of d - branes in the presence of a stack of 5-branes .",
    "similarly , our su(2 ) wzw results could be applicable in the study of branes on an ads@xmath8 string background , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "before we show how one can read off fuzzy geometry from branes in the wzw model , let us briefly review the emergence of non - commutative spaces in the more standard case of branes in flat @xmath9-dimensional euclidean space @xmath10 , or on a flat torus @xmath11 . consider a d - brane which is localized along a @xmath12-dimensional hyper - plane @xmath13 in the target , with tangent space @xmath14 .",

    "further comments on this general prescription will be given later , but now we would like to test it in the case of su(2 ) wzw models , where the semi - classical picture provides certain expectations as to how the `` quantized world - volume '' of branes should look like .",

    "differences between the two approaches occur only when @xmath147 is a root of unity . in that case ,",
    "boundary conformal field theory improves upon the old constructions in two respects .",
    "first of all , the theory gives `` physical '' representations exclusively so that there is no need for additional truncations .",
    "furthermore , the dimensions @xmath163 of the representation spaces are invariant under the simple current symmetry which interchanges @xmath95 and @xmath164 .",
    "when we increase the level @xmath5 , the radius of the three - sphere grows and we can fit more and more branes into the background . at the same time , the 3-form field strength decreases and the world - volume algebras become `` more associative ''  while their non - commutativity survives .",
    "this is to be compared to the non - commutative targets obtained in @xcite from closed strings : the @xmath67 limit of these targets is simply the classical group su(2 ) .",
    "the different behavior of closed and open string geometry may be explained as follows : both closed and open strings feel the presence of the ns 3-form field @xmath6 at finite level .",
    "open strings are also sensitive to the concrete choice of a 2-form potential @xmath2 , while closed strings `` see '' only its cohomology class . in the flat space limit @xmath81 ,",
    "the cohomology becomes trivial while @xmath2 itself stays non - zero and is responsible for non - commutativity on the brane .",
    "we have derived non - commutative world - volume algebras for d - branes in the su(2 ) wzw model , using a general scheme that can be applied to arbitrary branes given as conformal boundary conditions , including supersymmetric cases . in the process , we have seen how abstract objects from the cft description , like cardy s boundary states and runkel s ope coefficients , acquire a geometrical meaning  if in terms of non - commutative ( and sometimes non - associative ) spaces .",
    "the su(2 ) wzw model provides just the simplest example of a string background with a non - vanishing 3-form field strength @xmath6 , but we think that it illustrates quite nicely much of the behavior one should expect from more complicated backgrounds . in particular , the discussion of su(2 ) branes carries over to boundary wzw models with other structure groups g ( at least in the compact case ) and leads to a quantization of integer conjugacy classes in g. it might be interesting to investigate also branes that are not maximally symmetric , i.e.  where the gluing conditions respect only a subalgebra of the maximal chiral symmetry algebra @xcite .",
    "boundary cft yields world - volumes independently of whether limiting classical pictures are available or not , and it actually provides more structure than a mere set of non - commutative algebras .",
    "connes program @xcite shows that , in order to talk about the geometry of a non - commutative space , it is necessary to fix further `` spectral data '' , including a hilbert space on which the ( associative ) world - volume algebra and a generalized dirac or laplace operator act .",
    "how these data can be extracted from a cft has been discussed , for the bulk case , in @xcite .",
    "the importance of the laplace operator , which is related to the conformal hamiltonian @xmath165 , can also be seen in the context of our definition of non - commutative world - volumes : in order to re - derive the ope of boundary operators from the algebraic structure of the world - volume , the spectrum of conformal dimensions must be known , cf .  the remark after eq .",
    "( [ pointw ] ) . in a cft on the upper half - plane ,",
    "additional structure is available , e.g.  in the form of boundary condition changing operators which induce transitions between two different boundary conditions @xmath166 .",
    "the ope of the boundary fields @xmath167 with boundary condition changing operators gives rise to bi - modules @xmath168 over the world - volume algebras of the two associated branes . in the case of d",
    "- branes on a group manifold , these bi - modules allow to construct tensor products for representations of the associated quantum group .",
    "opes involving two boundary condition changing operators provide even more data , namely a full braided tensor category .    some comments on our general scheme to extract a world - volume algebras from the boundary cft description of branes are in order .",
    "it involves a choice of `` generating elements '' among the boundary fields . from a pure cft perspective",
    ", one could restrict to primary operators only , or one could work with all boundary operators and thus with an infinite - dimensional world - volume . in a sense , the latter algebra would include all internal excitations of the `` static '' space defined using primary fields .",
    "the wzw case , where it proved natural to keep the full group multiplets associated with primary boundary fields , suggests that there are distinguished `` intermediate '' choices . for a large class of cfts ,",
    "the appropriate generalization of the lowest - dimension spaces of wzw models is likely to be given by the special subspaces introduced in @xcite ; see also @xcite .    placing the cft into a string theory context",
    "can remove the arbitrariness and provide clear guidelines as to which world - volume generators to select from the boundary fields : string theory contains additional parameters like @xmath3 , and the relevant generators of the world - volume algebra are those surviving in some limiting regime .",
    "e.g.  in the flat background case , one can remove all higher excitations by sending @xmath3 to zero while keeping the @xmath2-field finite ; see @xcite and also @xcite .",
    "it may be possible that a number of interesting limits exists ; then one expects that the world - volume of a brane can look very different in different regimes , and that full string theory can `` interpolate '' between those geometries .",
    "the next task would be to calculate the effective action on the  in general non - commutative  world - volume of the brane .",
    "the lowest - order terms are , of course , already given by our `` multiplication table '' ( the ope coefficients ) . in principle , higher - order contributions can be computed from the same data , but in practice one still needs to integrate over world - sheet moduli . in the context of the douglas - hull model ,",
    "the effective field theories were found to be non - commutative supersymmetric gauge theories with some amount of non - locality @xcite .",
    "seiberg and witten could show that these models are equivalent to ordinary gauge theories on a flat brane @xcite .",
    "it remains to be seen whether classical structures are stretched further when more general cft backgrounds are taken as a starting point .",
    "perhaps it is worthwhile to compare the induced field theories with existing models on fuzzy geometries ( see e.g.  @xcite )",
    ".    it would also be interesting to investigate further the relation between world - volume non - commutativity as introduced in @xcite and non - commuting moduli as discovered by witten @xcite .",
    "both phenomena can be traced back to failures in locality properties of boundary fields ",
    "see @xcite for the case of moduli  so that there exists a direct connection between the brane s intrinsic `` fuzziness '' and the way it `` perceives '' its ambient target .",
