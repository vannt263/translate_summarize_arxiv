    "the most efficient way to generate coefficients of @xmath72 , and hence of @xmath76 , is to iterate the transition rules .",
    "greater performance is achieved by combining the valid sequences of three steps into one rule ,    @xmath77 : : :    @xmath78 ,    the right hand side being a multiset in which multiplicities are represented by exponents .    using _ mathematica _",
    "@xcite , we were able to calculate 993 values in the enumeration sequence for binary shrub forests avoiding @xmath79 .",
    "the first ten terms ( including the empty forest ) are : @xmath80 see a257995 in  @xcite for more .",
    "a _ maple _ program was then used to find a possible polynomial equation satisfied by the generating function .",
    "the first @xmath81 terms sufficed to suggest that @xmath76 was a root of the polynomial given in the statement of theorem  [ thmminpoly ] below , and hence is algebraic .      to prove that @xmath72 , and hence @xmath76 , is algebraic , we make use of a general result of bousquet - mlou and jehanne  @xcite . to state their theorem , we first need to introduce some notation .",
    "suppose @xmath82 is a bivariate formal power series .",
    "we define a sequence of operators @xmath83 , that discard the low order terms , as follows : @xmath84 \\;=\\ ; f_i(x ) \\:+\\ : f_{i \\:+\\ : 1}(x)u \\:+\\ : f_{i \\:+\\ : 2}(x)u^2 \\:+\\ : \\ldots .\\ ] ]    [ thmbmjanalytic ] if @xmath25 and @xmath85 are polynomials , then the functional equation @xmath86 ,             { { \\boldsymbol\\delta}}^2 \\big[f(x , u)\\big ] ,             \\ldots ,             { { \\boldsymbol\\delta}}^k \\big[f(x , u)\\big ] ,             x ,             u      \\big)\\ ] ] has a unique solution for @xmath87 that is a formal power series in @xmath88 whose coefficients are polynomials in @xmath89 .",
    "moreover , this solution is algebraic .",
    "the functional equation in theorem  [ thmfuncteqn ] is not in the appropriate form to apply theorem  [ thmbmjanalytic ] directly .",
    "setting @xmath90 , we have @xmath91 upon making these substitutions , the functional equation stated in theorem  [ thmfuncteqn ] becomes @xmath92 @xmath93 in addition , the definition of the @xmath94 operator implies that @xmath95 - u{{\\boldsymbol\\delta}}^{k+1}[g(x , u)]),\\ ] ] for @xmath96 .",
    "hence , the functional equation for @xmath97 can be transformed into the form in theorem  [ thmbmjanalytic ] by making this substitution for @xmath98 , clearing denominators , and rearranging .",
    "thus @xmath99 is algebraic , and hence so are @xmath72 and @xmath76 and its derivatives .",
    "we would like to solve our functional equation to get an explicit expression for @xmath76 .",
    "unfortunately , this is not possible .",
    "however , it is possible to determine the minimal polynomial of which @xmath76 is a root .",
    "[ thmminpoly ] the generating function @xmath100 for @xmath79-avoiding binary shrub forests is a root of the polynomial @xmath101 consequently , the growth rate of @xmath79-avoiding binary shrub forests is approximately 39.88873 , the greatest real root of the quartic polynomial @xmath102    given a suitable functional equation , bousquet - mlou and jehanne  @xcite present a way of setting up a system of polynomial equations that can then be solved to yield a polynomial having a root that is the desired generating function .",
    "they suggest that the `` laziest approach '' is to feed this system of equations to a grbner basis package and let it work . unfortunately",
    ", as they comment , `` this lazy approach often fails , because the computation tends to take forever '' .",
    "this has also been our experience .",
    "submission of the appropriate equations to _ singular _ , a computer algebra system optimized for working with polynomials , yielded no output after a week of processing .",
    "we use a more practical strategy , derived from the results in  @xcite ( see also section  4 of  @xcite ) . for the necessary algebraic manipulation , _ maple _  @xcite was used .    to start with ,",
    "since our functional equation is linear in @xmath72 , it can be expressed in the form @xmath103 where both @xmath104 and @xmath25 are polynomials that we omit for brevity and @xmath105 .",
    "thus , we can use the kernel method to eliminate both @xmath72 and @xmath89 .",
    "observe that the kernel @xmath106 if and only if @xmath107 . we want to eliminate @xmath89 from this pair of equations .",
    "to do so , we calculate the _ resultant _ of @xmath104 and @xmath25 . the resultant of two polynomials is a monomial multiple of a polynomial in their coefficients which has the property that it is equal to zero if and only if the polynomials have a common root .",
    "the resultant is given by the determinant of a matrix ( known as the sylvester matrix ) whose entries are coefficients of the polynomials .",
    "let @xmath108 be the resultant of @xmath104 and @xmath25 with respect to @xmath89 .",
    "then we have @xmath109 where @xmath110 is a large polynomial that can not be factored . to eliminate @xmath111 and @xmath112 , the _ discriminant _ of @xmath25",
    "can be used .",
    "the discriminant of a polynomial is a polynomial function of its coefficients which has the property that it is equal to zero if and only if the original polynomial has a multiple root .",
    "for example , it is well known that the discriminant of the quadratic @xmath113 with respect to @xmath88 is @xmath114 .",
    "with respect to @xmath88 being , up to a monomial factor , the resultant of @xmath115 and @xmath116 . ]",
    "we now apply this approach twice .",
    "we do not give the polynomials involved explicitly , as they would cover many pages .",
    "firstly , taking the discriminant of @xmath110 with respect to @xmath111 yields a new equation @xmath117 where @xmath118 is a polynomial only in @xmath88 , and @xmath119 can not be factored further .",
    "then , taking the discriminant of @xmath120 with respect to @xmath112 yields @xmath121 where @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 are polynomials .",
    "thus both @xmath123 and @xmath124 are possibilities for the minimal polynomial of @xmath125 .",
    "we rule out the first choice by observing that @xmath126 is nonzero , whereas @xmath127 as is required from considering the constant term of the series expansion of @xmath128 .",
    "@xmath124 is , in fact , the polynomial presented in the statement of the theorem , which is the same as the minimal polynomial that we were able to guess based on the first @xmath81 terms of the enumeration sequence .    the growth rate of the @xmath79-avoiding binary shrub forests",
    "is then determined from the minimal polynomial by taking its discriminant with respect to @xmath128 .",
    "the growth rate is given by the reciprocal of one of the positive real roots of the discriminant ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* note vii.36 , p.504 ) ) .",
    "as the growth rate must be at least @xmath74 , the positive real root whose reciprocal gives the growth rate must be at most @xmath74 .",
    "this leaves only one candidate , which is the greatest real root of the quartic polynomial in the statement of the theorem .",
    "throughout this paper we have studied forests of binary shrubs that avoid any permutation pattern of length 3 .",
    "this adds a new restriction to the classical pattern avoidance problem by requiring the digits @xmath129 to form a 123 or a 132 pattern for all @xmath15 .",
    "remarkably , forests avoiding a single pattern @xmath130 are in bijection with lattice paths in a wedge",
    ". it would be interesting to explore whether this phenomenon is more widespread .",
    "are other similar pattern - avoiding structures equinumerous to such lattice paths ?",
    "if so , is it possible to develop a more general theory to explain this ?",
    "in contrast to the other patterns , the enumeration of forests avoiding 321 required us to use the machinery of analytic combinatorics . however , perhaps , in this case too , there is a connection to lattice paths that remains to be uncovered .",
    "one natural generalization also merits further investigation . in theorem  [ t : av132 ] and the discussion after theorems  [ t : av213and312 ] and  [ t : av231 ] , we generalized our results to the case of @xmath14-ary shrubs rather than binary shrubs .",
    "more of our results could be generalized in this way or to forests of tree structures other than shrubs .",
