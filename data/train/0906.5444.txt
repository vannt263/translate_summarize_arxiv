    "it has been observationally suggested that the starburst phenomena is linked with the nuclear activities @xcite , and this connection was analytically studied based on a clumpy , turbulent accretion disk @xcite . in order to construct physical models of the obscuring material around a smbh , influenced also by concomitant star formation , three - dimensional radiative magneto - hydrodynamic calculations with a sufficiently high resolution and a fairly large dynamic range ( e.g. from 100 schwarzschild radii to 100 pc ) are ultimately necessary .",
    "however , until now , there are a few hydrodynamic studies in the central tens pc @xcite .",
    "@xcite ( hereafter wn02 ) investigated evolution of the ism in the inner 100 pc region around a @xmath27 smbh using three - dimensional euler - grid hydrodynamic simulations , taking into account self - gravity of the gas , radiative cooling and heating due to supernovae .",

    "the internal density , temperature are highly inhomogeneous , and the velocity field is turbulent , but the global geometry , i.e. a flared thick disk , is quasi - stable , implying that energy input from supernovae is balanced with turbulent dissipation .",

    "* ) , and 2 ) the cold , dense gas in their simulations does not necessary represent the dusty molecular gas phase around an agn , because h@xmath2formation and its radiative destruction by far ultra - violet radiation ( fuv ) from massive stars and collisional destruction are not included . as a result ,",
    "the radiative cooling in wn02 is not consistent with the chemical abundances in the low temperature medium .    including the molecular gas in numerical models",
    "will eventually yield a much richer interface with current and future observations .",
    "this is because unlike the dust continuum , the effectively optically thin molecular line emission ( even large line - center optical depths allow full view of turbulent media ) , is a direct probe of the velocity fields and thus of the gaseous disk dynamics , unobscured by the concomitant dust .",
    "the upcoming commissioning of alma will drastically enlarge such an interface by enabling the imaging of a whole suite of molecular lines probing different density and temperature regimes at high angular resolution .",

    "the initial condition is an axisymmetric and rotationally supported thin disk with a uniform density profile ( thickness is 2.5 pc ) and a total gas mass of @xmath61 .",
    "since we allow outflows from the computational boundaries , the total gas mass decreases during the evolution , and it settles to @xmath62 at a quasi - equilibrium state .",

    "since the negative feedback of fuv and supernova rate on h@xmath2mass is ` weak ' , it is also implied that if there is an episodic large mass inflow into the circum nuclear region , we expect a burst of star formation , because star formation rate depends on h@xmath2density .",

    "however , orbits of massive stars formed near the disk plane could have large inclination angles , as a result , energy from supernovae could be released at higher latitudes . in model l100b * , supernovae are assumed to be exploded in @xmath172 pc ( fig .",

    "we present new high resolution numerical simulations of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in a central @xmath0pc region around a supermassive black hole ( @xmath1 ) at a galactic center .",
    "three - dimensional hydrodynamic modeling of the ism ( wada & norman 2002 ) along with a concomitant starburst now includes tracking of the formation of molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath2 ) out of the neutral hydrogen phase as a function of the evolving ambient ism conditions with a finer spatial resolution ( 0.125 pc ) .",
    "radiative cooling rate is self - consistently changed depending on abundance of h@xmath2 in each grid cell . in a quasi equilibrium state ,",
    "mass fraction of h@xmath2is about 0.4 ( total h@xmath2mass is @xmath173 ) of the total gas mass for the uniform far uv ( fuv ) with @xmath82 in habing unit . as shown in the previous model , the gas forms an inhomogeneous disk , whose scale - height becomes larger in the outer region .",
    "h@xmath2forms a thin disk in the inner @xmath174 , and it is clumpy and swelled up toward @xmath175 .",
    "the velocity field of the disk is highly turbulent in the torus region .",
    "outflow of the gas forms a hot ( @xmath176 k ) funnel in the inner region .",
    "these structures and dynamics are energized by supernovae with average supernova rate ( snr ) of @xmath177 .",
    "gas column densities toward the nucleus larger than @xmath9 are found if the viewing angle is smaller than @xmath10 from the edge - on .",
    "however , the column densities are distributed over almost two orders of magnitude around the average for any given viewing angle due to the clumpy nature of the torus . the column density of h@xmath2shows a similar distribution , and @xmath178 is achieved for @xmath179 . for stronger fuv ( @xmath180 ) , the total h@xmath2mass in an equilibrium is only a little smaller ( @xmath12 0.35 ) and the molecular gas is slightly more concentrated in a plane , while other properties of the ism are also not very sensitive to the fuv intensity and supernova rate . vertical velocity dispersion of the gas in the torus ( @xmath181 on average ) is enhanced only by a factor of @xmath15 1.5 for increasing the supernova rate by two orders of magnitude .",
    "the structure and dynamics of these nuclear molecular disk presented here are very similar to molecular gas disk in various types of nearby agns recently revealed by ro - vibration line of h@xmath2using vlti / sinfoni and keck / osiris @xcite .",
    "the inconsistency on column density toward the center in ngc 1097 between the large column density suggested by co observations @xcite and x - ray @xcite could be attributed to the inhomogeneous structures emerging from the hereby presented disk models .",
    "finally , in the present results it is notable that although the assumed fuv and supernova rate may differ by orders of magnitude among the models , the total molecular gas fraction settles between @xmath170 .",
    "this weak ` negative ' feedback from fuv and supernovae on the star formation in the central region , suggests that substantial molecular gas disks can survive around agns with strong ongoing star formation .",
