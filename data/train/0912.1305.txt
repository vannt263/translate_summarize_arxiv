    "the rich variety of coherently exploitable degrees of freedom with which a photonic system is endowed has been extensively used in recent years in order to demonstrate the building blocks of quantum technology protocols including quantum cryptography  @xcite , quantum repeaters  @xcite , teleportation and quantum computing  @xcite . in this context , the exploitation of orbital angular momentum ( oam ) carried by light is settling as a new and exciting opportunity for coherent manipulation at the classical and quantum level  @xcite .",
    "high density data transmission  @xcite , activation of micro - machines and optical tweezers  @xcite are among the most prominent applications of optical oam so far .",
    "in addition , the field of quantum information processing has now started exploiting the additional opportunities offered by this photonic degree of freedom for communication and manipulation purposes .",
    "it has been shown that it is possible to create oam - entangled photons by means of a _ routinely used _",
    "setup such as spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc )  @xcite .",
    "this has triggered a plethora of studies on how to generate , manipulate and detect non - classical states of oam  @xcite , culminating in the demonstration of bell s inequality violation by oam - entangled two - photon states  @xcite , the introduction of so - called hyper - entangled states  @xcite , the design of quantum cryptographic schemes based on higher - dimensional systems  @xcite and the transfer of oam states from light to matter - like systems  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the latter scenario holds the potential for the realization of experimentally feasible long - time quantum memories embodied by superfluid rotational states of bose - einstein condensates ( becs )  @xcite .",
    "the spatial coherence intrinsic in a bec allows for a superfluid vortex state in which the bosons in the condensate have a well defined and quantized oam , which offers a perfect match with rotating photon carriers . along the seminal lines traced by the experiments in refs .",
    "@xcite , a few theoretical proposals for the light - to - vortex state transfer have been presented  @xcite . here",
    "we close the circle of these proposals and show that it is possible to create entanglement between two spatially separated becs by transferring oam from entangled photon resources to the condensates .",
    "we propose a simple and efficient scheme to achieve this goal using experimentally achievable parameters and routinely produced oam - entangled light resources . on a different level ,",
    "our study proposes a scheme that is able to transfer ( with in principle 100% efficiency ) higher - dimensional entanglement between two independent system by means of bilocal interactions , thus contributing to an area that is witnessing theoretical and experimental interest ( see choi _ et al . _ in  @xcite and ref .",

    "let us start by presenting the model used in order to describe the light - to - bec transfer of entanglement .",
    "we shall see that a key point in this mechanism resides in the collective coupling of the atoms belonging to one of the becs to the respective light field .",
    "together with the indistinguishability of the resource photons , this permits us to entangle the two becs .",
    "we consider two spatially separated and trapped becs , each with @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) @xmath2rb atoms and let each of them interact with one of the field modes of an oam - entangled two - photon state ( see the sketch in fig .  [",

    "such a photonic resource can be produced , for instance , by type - i parametric down conversion of a gaussian laser beam which is an oam - preserving process : this implies that the output modes , here labeled as @xmath3 and @xmath4 , carry opposite oam and enter the state @xmath5 here , @xmath6 indicates an @xmath7-photon state populating mode @xmath3 and carrying oam equal to @xmath8 .",

    "the main idea behind our proposal is that the arrangement of a locally - assisted oam - transfer from a light mode to the respective bec would also allow for the transfer of quantum correlations , therefore constructing an effective entangled channel involving remote matter systems .",

    "we take the time evolution due to the fields as faster than the center of mass motion of the atom when in one of the excited levels , so that we can neglect the free atomic hamiltonian for these states .",

    "[ fig : pur105 ] .",
    "as expected , at exactly the time when the populations of the oam carrying atomic system become non - zero , the linear entropy changes its behavior , signaling a maximum of mixedness of the light - matter state .",

    "if time increases further , @xmath158 evidently decreases , witnessing a reduction in the light - matter entanglement . because of the conservation of entanglement discussed above ,",

    "we stress that this is not a limitation of our scheme but , on the contrary , an effect of the zero - oam component in the photonic resource @xmath120 .",
    "such a detrimental contribution can be removed from the becs reduced state ( and its properties ) by resorting to an  active \" approach where , instead of discarding the state of light after the interaction with the condensates , we properly _ post - select _ its state . upon inspection of @xmath168 in eqs .",

    "it is therefore sufficient to use a standard geiger - like avalanche photo - detector per mode , which discriminate the vacuum from the presence of any non - zero number of photons in a field , in order to operate the optimal post - selection of the becs state : by registering no click at both the photo - detectors , we project the state of @xmath35 and @xmath36 onto the maximally entangled state @xmath151 .",
    "it is in fact worth stressing that , by effectively excluding the possibility that the atoms occupy state @xmath116 , the post - selection procedure further reduces the dimension of the relevant hilbert space spanned by each vortex state to a bidimensional one , thus leaving us with two effective qubits .",
    "in this section we describe a method for the detection of the vortex entanglement created by the process above . given the low - excitation level of our protocol , the usual matter - wave interference is not helpful and we instead propose an approach based on the inversion of the process addressed here for light - to - bec entanglement transfer .",
    "after generation of a two - vortex entangled state ( as described in sec .",

    "remarkably , the analysis of @xmath187 for incoherent superpositions of oam eigenstates results in a flat distribution .",

    "any deviation from flat distributions typical of incoherent superpositions implies coherence in the bipartite state , although not entanglement .",

    "we have shown that vortex states of spatially remote , non - isotropically trapped becs can be entangled by means of bilocal oam - transfer processes and quantum correlated photonic resources .",
    "the amount of vortex entanglement set by our scheme can be quite considerable and appears to be limited only by the zero - oam carrying component in the photonic resource .",

    "the difference between the two - vortex state achieved by our scheme and a classical admixture of oam eigenstates ( without coherence and , thus , entanglement ) can be revealed by a straigthforward _ state - retrieval _ process and the reconstruction of the oam - state wigner function .",
    "we believe that the superfluid phase of a bec , together with virtually frictionless rotational states of light - induced vortices , can be reliably exploited in order to set a promising scenario for the storage of quantum information and the distribution of quantum correlated channels for communication .",
