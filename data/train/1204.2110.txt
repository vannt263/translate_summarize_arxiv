    "<S> when the interaction energy completely dominates over the kinetic energy , the ferromagnetic instability is one of the few problems for which exact results are available , albeit for a restricted range of fillings @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> flat band systems are receiving a great deal of attention right now , in particular with the view of realizing new many - body phases there ( see @xcite and references therein ) ; in this context , the possibility of ferromagnetism as a many - body instability is also being considered @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore timely to provide a detailed study of the phase diagram and the critical properties of this form of magnetism : we analyze a flat - band ferromagnet with an on - site hubbard interaction of strength @xmath0 . for @xmath1 , </S>",
    "<S> any state involving electrons occupying the flat band only is trivially a ground state .    </S>",
    "<S> crucially , this degeneracy is only partially lifted when a repulsive @xmath2 is switched on . </S>",
    "<S> first , since the flat band permits well - localized real - space electronic wave functions , at low density electrons can be placed on the lattice so that they do not overlap . </S>",
    "<S> second , even if they do overlap , they can still avoid paying an energy penalty @xmath3 : the basic reason is that the pauli principle , by demanding an antisymmetric pair wave function , makes the overlap between two electrons on the same site vanish provided they are in a symmetric spin state . </S>",
    "<S> this is the origin of flat - band ferromagnetism .    as the density of electrons increases , </S>",
    "<S> ferromagnetic clusters of increasing size appear . </S>",
    "<S> the degeneracy , @xmath4 , of a ferromagnetic cluster containing @xmath5 electrons , gives differing weights to different clustering of electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the ferromagnetic transition corresponds to the emergence of a cluster containing a nonzero fraction of the electrons .    an early remark by mielke @xcite likened this problem to one of percolation . </S>",
    "<S> mielke and tasaki @xcite noted that , for a class of flat - band ferromagnets on particular decorated lattices , the percolation problem in question is not a standard one @xcite but rather one including nontrivial weights .    here , we develop this analogy in detail . </S>",
    "<S> first of all , we point out that the interaction between the clusters , on account of its `` statistical origin '' in the pauli principle , is unusual in that it is range - free and purely geometric  two particles interact only if they form part of the same cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction is genuinely many - body in that it can not be decomposed into a sum of pairwise terms . </S>",
    "<S> it is effectively repulsive and only depends on the size of the cluster , irrespective of its shape . despite its long range , </S>",

    "<S> we find that it has a number of interesting features in its own right . </S>",
    "<S> it provides an instance of a problem in the quantum physics of strongly correlated electrons which can be `` reduced '' to a highly nontrivial problem in _ classical _ statistical mechanics , on which an entirely different set of tools can be brought to bear .        </S>",
    "<S> we first demonstrate some special features of this problem by providing a complete exact solution of the one - dimensional ( 1d ) version of this model , which corresponds to a sawtooth lattice potentially realized in strongly correlated sawtoothlike compounds such as @xmath6 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unlike standard percolation , this exhibits a tendency to break up large clusters as well as a development of spatial ( anti)correlations . </S>",
    "<S> its percolation transition at full filling is continuous .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we carry out an analysis of the phase diagram for the two - dimensional ( 2d ) tasaki lattice , a decorated square lattice ( see left panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) . using a numerical algorithm custom - tailored to the problem at hand by extending the hoshen - kopelman and newman - ziff algorithms @xcite for standard percolation , we establish that the ferromagnetic transition does indeed take place at a filling comfortably in excess of the corresponding well - known percolation transition on the square lattice at @xmath7 @xcite . in the grand - canonical ensemble , </S>",
