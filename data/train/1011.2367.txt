    "many statistical systems are difficult to `` probe '' since their phase spaces display complicated landscapes full of energetic valleys and hills @xcite . in such case",
    ", a non - representative sampling of the microstates , e.g. , due to uneven visits to the different domains @xcite , can lead to metastability and broken ergodicity , with a consequent non - convergence to equilibrium and poor estimates for the thermodynamic quantities @xcite .",
    "this is exactly the situation found in first - order phase transitions @xcite , where the free - energy minima are separated by large barriers , and simple one - flip metropolis approaches are unable to solve the problem .",
    "thus , different methods  aimed to guarantee ergodic simulations in the context described above  have been proposed @xcite . among the so called enhanced sampling algorithms ,",
    "a particularly important one due to its simplicity and generality is the simulated tempering ( st ) @xcite ( closely related to the also relevant parallel ( or replica ) tempering , pt , approach @xcite ) . here , tempering means that along the simulations the system can undergo temperature changes .",
    "consider we shall analyze a system at @xmath0 . besides an usual monte carlo ( mc ) prescription , in the st algorithm @xmath1 is also treated as a dynamical variable : the temperature can assume distinct values from a set @xmath2 , switching from time to time according to established accepting probabilities @xmath3 s .",
    "of course , during the simulations the relevant averages necessary to obtain the sought thermodynamic quantities are performed only when the system is at @xmath4 .",
    "the central idea is that temporary evolutions at higher @xmath1 s strongly facilitates the crossing of the free - energy barriers , then allowing uniform visits to the multiple regions of a fragmented phase - space @xcite .",
    "a fundamental ingredient in the st is the definition of the accepting probabilities @xcite ; functions of the energy , the different @xmath1 s and appropriate weight factors @xmath5 ( see next section as well as interesting discussions in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . by their turn , the exact expressions for the @xmath5 s depend on the problem partition function @xmath6 , a quantity often difficult to calculate @xcite , demanding computationally time consuming methods @xcite .",
    "obviously , approximations for the @xmath5 s can be used ( e.g. , as in ref .",
    "but so the st efficiency can be dramatically hindered , once the weights themselves can create certain bias for the sampling .",
    "for instance , they may lead to unbalanced sorted temperatures , given rise to a non - ergodic visit of the phase - space if the probabilities to pick the lower @xmath7 s are too high . on the other hand ,",
    "if the more frequent @xmath1 s are the greater ones , the generated set of microstates can not properly characterize the system features at @xmath0 , the actual temperature of interest . such technical aspects associated to the @xmath5 s are even more delicate for first order phase transitions , a situation rarely analyzed with the st @xcite .    given the previous comments , our purpose in this contribution is twofold .",
    "first , to present a numerically simple  yet quite accurate ",
    "procedure to obtain the weight factors @xmath5 , thus making the st algorithm easier to implement , e.g. , by avoiding involving recursive protocols @xcite .",
    "this is accomplished with a method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , where @xmath6 is calculated directly from the transfer matrix largest eigenvalue ( @xmath8 ) , straightforward to compute from monte carlo simulations .",
    "the key point is that although @xmath8 gives the exact @xmath6 only at the thermodynamical limit , i.e. , for infinite systems , the convergence is very fast .",
    "so , even for a relatively small system ( as will be illustrated in the examples ) , any difference between its exact @xmath6 and that from @xmath8 can be neglected and for all practical reasons the approach leads to the correct @xmath5 s .",
    "second , to consider the st for the already mentioned difficult case of first - order transitions , showing that the st is also a helpful tool to address such regime , a possibility barely explored in the literature .",
    "the work is organized as the following .",
    "we review the st algorithm and how to calculate @xmath5 from the transfer matrix in section ii .",
    "also in section ii we exemplify the procedure efficiency by computing the partition function for the ising model , a system for which @xmath6 can be obtained exactly . in section iii and iv",
    "we compare the present with other well established methods to study first - order phase transitions , taking as case studies the blume - capel , blume - emery - griffiths ( beg ) and bell - lavis models .",
    "finally , remarks and the conclusion are drawn in section v.",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the st algorithm is generally implemented as two steps procedure , repeated a given number of times .",

    "( [ p - definition ] ) , @xmath16 is the problem hamiltonian , @xmath13 the actual microscopic state , and @xmath17 arbitrary , so non - adjacent temperatures changes are allowed .",
    "moreover , @xmath18 with @xmath19 always set equal to 1 hereafter .",
    "we observe that @xmath20 is strongly dependent on the weights @xmath5 s . indeed , for an appropriate sampling the evolution should uniformly visit all the established temperatures , which is the case when @xmath21 for @xmath22 the free - energy per volume @xmath23 at @xmath7 . recalling the relation @xmath24/v$ ] , we see that the calculation of @xmath5 is not a trivial task : neither the partition function nor the free - energy can be obtained directly from mc simulations since there are no thermodynamic quantities whose averages lead to @xmath6 and @xmath25 . for this reason",
    "some alternative methods have been proposed @xcite . here",
    "we shall consider a rather simple numerical approach to compute @xmath22 @xcite , based on the transfer matrix @xmath26 largest eigenvalue @xmath8 .",
    "briefly , at the thermodynamic limit it holds true that ( see details in the appendix ) @xmath27 with @xmath28 and @xmath29 the spatial dimension . to obtain @xmath8",
    "is straightforward .",
    "in fact , suppose for definiteness a 2d system with @xmath30 layers of @xmath31 sites each , so @xmath32 .",

    "we also should mention that @xmath40 and @xmath41 can be evaluated from quite standard mc simulations .    as the final step ,",
    "the weights follow from @xmath46/l .",

    "( [ z - lambda ] ) is exactly only for infinite size systems , if @xmath31 ( or @xmath30 ) is not too small the relation is extremely accurate .",
    "hence , for any practical purpose eq .",
    "( [ g - eigen ] ) gives the correct @xmath5 , as we are going to illustrate in the next sections .    in this way",
    ", we can summarize the proposed approach as the following .",
    "first , with eqs .",
    "( [ lambzero])-([g - eigen ] ) one evaluates the partition function and consequently the free - energy weights ( at the temperatures @xmath47 ) from usual mc simulations .",
    "second , having the correct @xmath5 s , one just implement the st algorithm as previously explained .    finally , we comment on three important technical issues .",
    "the first is related to the query : how can standard mc simulations lead to good values for @xmath5 around first - order phase transition if then metropolis algorithm usually yields unbalanced samplings ?",
    "the answer relies on the fact that the free - energies are all equal at such regime of phases coexistence .",
    "hence , even a biased microscopic sampling will result in accurate free - energies and consequently appropriate @xmath5 s . on the other hand",
    ", the metastability typical of @xmath1 s in the vicinity of the transition temperature can difficult the determination ( with the necessary precision ) of the function @xmath48 in such interval .",
    "thus , derivatives of @xmath6 with respect to distinct parameters , representing different thermodynamic quantities , will give poor results .",
    "so , a second point is that the transfer matrix alone is not a reliable method to study first - order phase transitions .",
    "lastly , we mention that in the limit of large systems and high temperatures @xmath41 is small , since the probability for the configurations @xmath44 and @xmath45 to be the same is very low . as a consequence , one may get bad estimations for the weights . in this case",
    ", a possible way to circumvent the problem is to decrease the size @xmath31 of each layer and to increase the number of layers , maintaining the volume @xmath32 constant ( see also the discussion in the section v ) .",

    "( [ z - lambda ] ) for finite size systems , we consider the ising model , whose partition function can be calculated exactly .",

    "[ z - lambda ] ) .",
    "the agreement is indeed remarkable , indicating that even for relatively small systems , @xmath6 and therefore @xmath25 are already very close to their values at the thermodynamic limit .",
    "since the above system presents a very well known and simple first - order phase transition ( for @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) , we prefer to address such regime , our focus in this contribution , for other models in the following sections .",

    "hereafter all the quantities will be given in units of @xmath55 .",
    "for the blume - capel case , @xmath71 , accurate estimates for @xmath25 ( which directly gives the st weights once @xmath72 ) is available from the very efficient wang - landau method .",

    "next , two remarks are in order .",
    "first , as already mentioned , an advantage of the present implementation is the relative low computation cost in obtaining the refined weights  based on standard mc simulations . it is not our purpose here a detailed benchmark comparison between different methods",
    "nevertheless , without going into the merit of the ( good ) performance of other approaches such as wang - landau and parallel tempering ( for the later , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we observe the following .",
    "algorithmically speaking , in principle the st may be faster since it does not demand : either ( i ) to know the density of states as in the wang - landau ( usually a hard task , e.g. , in our examples involving @xmath138 configurations ) ; or ( ii ) to simultaneously simulate many replicas as in the pt ( in the st only one system realization is considered ) .",
    "second , by increasing too much the system size , the accepting probabilities for the temperature exchanges decrease , eventually leading to a poor estimation for the thermodynamic quantities ( but for a possible way to assuage it , see the end of section ii ) .",
    "in fact , the difficulty in simulating large systems is not a peculiarity of the st .",
    "it also may be the case in others methods like the pt and wang - landau .",
    "a finite - size analysis circumvent this problem , but in practice should use @xmath31 s up to a certain maximum value @xmath139 , for which the considered method still works well .",
    "the crucial point is whether @xmath139 allows a correct extrapolation to the thermodynamic limit . in our many examples , for @xmath31 around 25",
    "we already can predict this limit .",
    "but other situations would require , say , @xmath140 , which in principle could be calculated with our approach if we use a larger set of temperatures @xmath47 , but with @xmath141 fixed . presently , such issue is under investigation and will the subject of a forthcoming publication .    in summary ,",
    "the examples given show that the st algorithm allied to our straightforward way to calculate the weights is able to deal with free - energy barriers , common at the phase coexistence , and therefore can be very useful in characterizing first - order phase transitions .",
    "we acknowledge researcher grants from cnpq . financial support is also provided by cnpq - edital universal , fundao araucria and finep / ct - infra .",

    "<S> the simulated tempering ( st ) is an important method to deal with systems whose phase spaces are hard to sample ergodically . </S>",
    "<S> however , it uses accepting probabilities weights which often demand involving and time consuming calculations . </S>",
    "<S> here it is shown that such weights are quite accurately obtained from the largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix  a quantity straightforward to compute from direct monte carlo simulations  thus simplifying the algorithm implementation . as tests , </S>",
    "<S> different systems are considered , namely , ising , blume - capel , blume - emery - griffiths and bell - lavis liquid water models . in particular , we address first - order phase transition at low temperatures , a regime notoriously difficulty to simulate because the large free - energy barriers . the good results found ( </S>",
    "<S> when compared with other well established approaches ) suggest that the st can be a valuable tool to address strong first - order phase transitions , a possibility still not well explored in the literature . </S>"
