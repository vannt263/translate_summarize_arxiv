    "the possibility that a liquid - gas phase transition in finite nuclei may manifest itself via copious production of intermediate - mass fragments ( imf ) in energetic heavy - ion reactions has driven both , theoretical and experimental studies of nuclear multifragmentation over more than a decade . a prominent role in theoretical considerations",
    "is played by the concept of a freezeout configuration.@xcite this concept implies the existence of a definite volume , within which the system reaches a state close to thermal equilibrium . while the existence of an effective freezout volume may be debatable , the concept itself is useful for understanding the possible behavior of nuclear matter under various conditions .",
    "with such a didactic strategy in mind , and as an extension of earlier studies modelling the behavior of finite fermi systems , @xcite the present study considers pseudo - fermi matter confined to a box of definite volume .",
    "it evaluates the isothermal behavior of such matter and its dependence on box volume and temperature .",
    "the utmost simplicity of the formalism allows one to gain insight into physical phenomena that may be obscured in more rigorous approaches .",
    "the present study considers a scenario of nuclear pseudo - fermi matter of mass number @xmath0 , locked in a spherical box of a volume @xmath1 and kept at constant temperature @xmath2 . in the proposed formalism",
    ", thermostatic properties of the matter are modelled by two equations , the isochoric caloric equation of state , and the zero - temperature equation of state .",
    "the equilibrium state of the system is then found as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , based on the requirement that the free energy of the system be minimal .",
    "first , we consider homogeneous systems with constant density throughout their volume , i.e. , systems in states where only one phase is present . the isochoric caloric equation of state for such",
    "a system is taken in a simple form adequate for low - temperature fermi gases    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the thermal energy and @xmath5 is the level density parameter .",
    "the latter parameter is assumed to depend on matter density as    @xmath6    in accordance with the low - temperature fermi gas model .",
    "it is worthwhile keeping in mind , that for fermi gases , eq .  [ eq : caloric_eq ] is a good approximation only for temperatures that are small compared to the fermi energy , i.e. , for @xmath7 .",
    "notably , for diluted or very hot fermi systems , with the matter density approaching zero , @xmath8 , or for high temperatures , @xmath9 , the caloric equation of state approaches asymptotically that of a classical gas :    @xmath10    for the sake of simplicity and without loss of generality , the present study uses eq .",
    "[ eq : caloric_eq ] over the full range of matter densities and temperatures considered .",
    "the term `` pseudo - fermi '' matter is used to distinguish the matter considered here from true fermi matter .",
    "the second defining equation , the zero - temperature equation of state , expresses the compressional ( potential ) energy of the system as a function of the system volume or as a function of matter density .",
    "the present study adopts the harmonic approximation in the form used in the expanding emitting source model ( eesm ) @xcite , whereby the in - medium nucleonic ( potential ) energy changes quadratically with the relative deviation of the actual matter density from the ground - state density , by an amount    @xmath11    in eq .",
    "[ eq : compress ] , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are compressional and ground - state binding energies per nucleon , respectively , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the actual and the ground - state matter densities , respectively . equation [ eq : compress ] implies an effective ground - state incompressibility constant of @xmath16=-18@xmath13 . assuming @xmath13=-8 mev , the effective incompressibility , including the effects of surface tension , equals @xmath17 mev .",
    "note , that within the harmonic approximation , for infinite nuclear matter characterized by @xmath18 mev , the incompressibility constant is @xmath19 mev .",
    "the latter value places the present harmonic approximation `` neutrally '' between the currently considered limits of `` soft '' and `` hard '' equations of state for nuclear matter .",
    "while the two defining equations [ eq : caloric_eq ] and [ eq : compress ] may be considered rather crude approximations , they do contain the essential physics responsible for first - order phase transitions and critical phenomena .",
    "given these two equation , one can write expressions for all thermodynamic quantities characterizing the system , including the helmholtz free energy @xmath20 .",
    "the state of the system can then be found by minimizing the free energy , for any box volume @xmath1 and temperature @xmath2 .    based on eq .",
    "[ eq : caloric_eq ] , one can write for the entropy @xmath21 of a homogeneous system @xmath22    the free energy , @xmath20 , for a homogeneous , single - phase system is given by @xmath23    in eq .",
    "[ eq : free_energy ] , for sake of simplicity , the free energy is given relative to a constant ground state energy of the system .",

    "[ eq : free_energy ] can be rewritten in a form revealing explicitly the important dependence on the matter density @xmath14 , i.e. , @xmath24    eq .",

    "the pressure @xmath25 can be expressed generally as the negative partial derivative of the free energy @xmath20 with respect to volume @xmath1 , at fixed number of nucleons @xmath0 and fixed temperature @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath27    thus , for the case of pseudo - fermi matter considered here , one obtains based on eqs .",

    "[ eq : free_energy_f ] and [ eq : chempot_general ] , and noting further that @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , one obtains for the chemical potential @xmath34-{1\\over 3}\\alpha_o({\\rho\\over \\rho_o})^{-{2\\over 3}}t^2.\\ ] ]    it is worth noting in eq .",
    "[ eq : chempot_pseudo ] that , as a result of the requirement for @xmath1 to be constant , the magnitude of the chemical potential differs significantly from the value of the free energy per nucleon .",
    "for example , the contribution of thermal excitation to the chemical potential is only one - third of what constitutes the thermal part of the free energy per nucleon .",
    "when confined to a thermostatic box , matter will eventually fill all of the available volume @xmath1 so as to minimize the free energy of the system . for non - interacting matter , the minimum free energy always corresponds to a uniform density distribution .",
    "this is generally not true for an interacting system . in particular , for interacting pseudo - fermi matter at the minimum free energy , low - density and high - density phases coexist .",
    "for a two - phase system of @xmath0 nucleons confined to volume @xmath1 at temperature @xmath2 , the free energy can be expressed as a function of two variables , e.g. , in terms of the volume of the gaseous phase , @xmath35 , and the number of nucleons contained in this phase , @xmath36 . @xmath37    inserting for @xmath38 and @xmath39 the expressions given by eq .",

    "[ eq : free_energy_gas ] and [ eq : free_energy_liquid ] represent single - phase states as special cases .",
    "a pure liquid / gas state is thus among the possible outcomes of the calculations with @xmath46 . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : isotherms ] , the isotherms feature segments representing both , pure liquid and pure gas and , notably , the liquid - gas coexistence `` plateaus '' .",
    "the presence of coexistence plateaus does not come as a surprise as the harmonic interaction term of eq .",
    "[ eq : compress ] has the salient characteristics of a van der waals interaction .",
    "it is worth noting that the coexistence plateaus in this calculation result naturally from the actual minimization of the free energy and are not obtained via the well - known phenomenological maxwell construct .",

    "as expected , these curves do not feature plateaus reported in various experiments,@xcite but rather inconspicuous kinks at the locations on the boundary of the coexistence domain .",
    "one of the salient features of critical behavior in van der waals systems is the presence of a singularity at the critical point . here , when the system temperature t approaches the critical temperature @xmath48 from below , the difference between the densities of coexisting liquid and gaseous phases vanishes according to a power law @xmath53    in eq .",

    "indeed , an approximately 2-mev wide linear domain extending from the critical temperature @xmath48 down to lower temperatures .",
    "a linear fit to this domain allows one to extract the `` coordinates '' of the critical point of @xmath48= 10.0 mev , and @xmath57=0.42 .",

    "a simple formalism has been presented that allows one to model the behavior of interacting pseudo - fermi matter under the conditions of controlled volume and temperature .",
    "the formalism is shown to capture the essential physics of a first - order liquid - gas phase transition .",
    "the calculation demonstrates the characteristics of nuclear liquid - gas coexistence in a certain domain of system parameters and the presence of a critical point . while such characteristics are well expected , based on the the similarity of the utilized form of interaction to that of the van der waals interaction , the present formalism offers many didactical benefits .",
    "for example , due to its simplicity it offers a clear insight into physical phenomena it purports to describe and a relatively strict test - bench for possible qualitative or `` hand - waving '' arguments .",
    "the results obtained , while almost trivial , may alert one to possible challenges found by more complete models . as an example , it is evident from fig .  1 that models of nuclear multifragmentation such as smm @xcite and mmmc @xcite tend to overpredict fragment multiplicities significantly .",
    "this is so , because these models assume that the liquid phase is always at ground - state density @xmath15 .",
    "this forces the pressure of the surrounding gas within the freezeout volume to be higher than would be necessary to counter the lower pressure of the expanded liquid at equilibrium density . a higher gas pressure results in an overestimate of particle and fragment multiplicities .",
    "the formalism presented here leaves ample room for further refinements such as a more strict modelling of the diluted fermi matter , or the inclusion of isotopic effects . at any rate",
    ", it offers a convenient didactic tool to achieve a better understanding of nuclear thermodynamics ."
