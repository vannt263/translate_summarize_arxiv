    "we examine a class of algorithms that can be used by a group of agents ( e.g. , uavs , nodes of a communication network , etc . ) in order to reach consensus on a common opinion ( represented by a scalar or vector ) , starting from different initial opinions , and possibly in the presence of severe restrictions on inter - agent communications .",

    "note that condition ( b ) may be rewritten in matrix form as @xmath56 the rationale behind condition ( c ) is as follows .",
