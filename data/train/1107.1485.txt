    "in the presence symmetry breaking potential , a translationally symmetric hamiltonian can be constructed via the virtual crystal approximation ( vca ) : @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are hamiltonians with broken translational symmetry in the basis of wannier orbitals @xmath11 located at normal cell index @xmath33 .",
    "the summation of @xmath34 is over inequivalent normal cell lattice vectors in a single supercell ( namely the positions of two or more inequivalent fe sites ) .",
    "thus , the symmetry breaking terms of the original hamiltonian would be averaged out , but the symmetry respecting terms would be kept .    in the fe - based superconductors , one can choose whether to integrate the as @xmath4 orbitals into fe @xmath1 wannier orbitals or not , during the construction of the wannier orbitals .",
    "if as @xmath4 orbitals are integrated out , we will effectively obtain the five - band vca hamiltonian from eq .  1 . if not , the eight - band vca hamiltonian ( 5 fe @xmath1 and 3 as @xmath4 ) will be obtained .",
    "3 in the letter shows clearly that vca has a larger impacts in the 8-band case .",
    "this is easily understood from the following consideration . in the 8-band case ,",
    "the symmetry breaking terms are mostly those hopping terms involving fe @xmath1 and as @xmath4 orbitals , since as @xmath4 orbitals are located in different locations . upon integrating out these terms , they effectively renormalize the remaining hopping terms between fe @xmath1 orbitals , both the symmetry breaking and symmetry respecting ones . by throwing out the symmetry breaking terms at the eight - band level via vca , one also removes the renormalization to the symmetry respecting hopping between fe @xmath1 orbitals as well . in either case , however , the qualitative effect of losing the electron pockets persists , since it is mostly dictated by the symmetry property of the system and is thus more robust against detail changes of the hamiltonian .",

    "<S> we investigate the physical effects of translational symmetry breaking in fe - based high - temperature superconductors due to alternating anion positions . in the representative parent compounds , including the newly discovered fe - vacancy - ordered @xmath0 , an unusual change of orbital character is found across the one - fe brillouin zone upon unfolding the first - principles band structure and fermi surfaces , suggesting that covering a larger one - fe brillouin zone is necessary in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> most significantly , the electron pockets ( critical to the magnetism and superconductivity ) are found only created with the broken symmetry , advocating strongly its full inclusion in future studies , particularly on the debated nodal structures of the superconducting order parameter .    </S>",
    "<S> utf8bsmi    one confusing / puzzling aspect of the new iron - based high - temperature superconductors is the dilemma of one - fe vs. two - fe description , concerning the translational symmetry of the system . </S>",

    "<S> since this coordination is known to impose dramatic impacts on the hopping integrals of fe @xmath1 orbitals @xcite , the associated broken translational symmetry ( from 1-fe perspective ) is expected to be physically significant and should be fully incorporated via the use of the unit cell that contains explicitly two fe atoms . yet , </S>",
    "<S> the observed neutron scattering intensity @xcite shows little ( if any ) indication of such broken symmetry ; it appears to follow simply the 1-fe brillouin zone ( bz ) of a simple square lattice of fe atoms ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1b ) . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , out of convenience , most theoretical studies of superconductivity to date do not account fully for this broken translational symmetry , disregarding the rigorous symmetry constraint . </S>",
    "<S> it is thus important and timely to clarify quantitatively various aspects of the effects from this broken symmetry ( its relevance / irrelevance ) , and to settle , once for all , the confusing status of the field on the 1-fe vs. 2-fe perspective .    in this letter , </S>",
    "<S> three striking effects of the translational symmetry breaking potential ( tsbp ) are revealed by unfolding the _ ab initio _ electronic band structures ( ebss ) and fermi surfaces ( fss ) of representative parent compounds back to the 1-fe bz : ) the folded fe bands ( `` shadow '' bands ) possess overall weak spectral weight , explaining the 1-fe perspective advocated by the neutron measurements , and indicating the necessity of the larger 1-fe bz in angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) as well . ) </S>",
    "<S> the folding of the bands induces an unusual parity switching in their orbital characters , suggesting a change of photon polarization in arpes . ) </S>",
    "<S> most strikingly , the widely discussed electron fermi pockets around @xmath2 and @xmath3 for supporting superconductivity would not have existed without the tsbp . </S>",
    "<S> this advocates strongly the full inclusion of tsbp ( the 2-fe perspective ) in theoretical understanding of superconductivity in these materials , and suggests a critical re - examination of the debated nodal structure of the superconducting order parameter @xcite on the electron pockets .    ) </S>",
    "<S> anions located above ( below ) the fe plane , and ( b ) the corresponding first brillouin zones . ]        our theoretical analysis is based on unfolded first - principles ebss and fss of the normal state in 1-fe perspective , which reveals explicitly various aspects of the tsbp effects . </S>",
    "<S> standard density functional theory ( dft ) calculations  @xcite were conducted with local density approximation in the minimum unit cell ( 8 fe for @xmath0 and 2 fe for the rest ) . based on the dft results , symmetry - respecting wannier functions @xcite with fe </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 and anion @xmath4 characters were constructed to capture the low energy hilbert space within [ -6 , 3 ] ev , based on which the low energy effective tight - binding hamiltonians , @xmath5 , were calculated . </S>",
    "<S> finally , unfolded ebss and fss were obtained via the recently developed first - principles unfolding method @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea of our unfolding method  @xcite is to simply represent the energy- , @xmath6- , dependent one - particle spectral function of the real systems ( 2-fe zone ) using the basis from a more symmetric reference system ( 1-fe zone ) : @xmath7 , where @xmath8/@xmath9 denotes the crystal momentum of the original / reference system , @xmath10 the band index , and @xmath11 the wannier orbital index . </S>",
    "<S> this change of basis is made simple with the use of first - principles wannier functions  @xcite . as demonstrated below </S>",
    "<S> , the unfolded ebss and fss provide explicit and detailed information on each band s coupling to the tsbp in an orbital specific manner . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , it can be shown @xcite that the unfolded spectral function corresponds directly to the intensity of arpes , as it includes the main matrix element effects of the measurement ( expect the remaining atomic dipole matrix element to be determined based on the chosen photon polarization ) . </S>",
    "<S> this use of `` regular '' momentum distinguishes our method from the glide symmetry - based unfolding employed by , for example , andersen and boeri @xcite , in which the twisted geometry does not have direct correspondence to the arpes . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the use of regular momentum is essential in the widely applied spin fluctuation studies @xcite of superconductivity via magnetic susceptibility , @xmath12 , since the momentum transfer @xmath13 concerns the _ difference _ of two @xmath9 points .    </S>",
    "<S> our resulting unfolded ebss and fss of the representative families in the nonmagnetic state are shown in fig .  2 , colored to emphasize the essential fe @xmath1 orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> ( enlarged figures focusing around the fermi energy are given in the supplementary materials  @xcite . ) a few generic features of unfolding can be clearly observed , for example , in fig .  2c . </S>",
    "<S> the most obvious one is the appearance of the shadow bands , generated from band `` folding '' via the tsbp . since here </S>",
    "<S> the tsbp is of momentum @xmath14 in the 1-fe bz unit ( except for @xmath15 and @xmath0 , whose double layer structure gives @xmath16 instead ) each band is folded from @xmath9 to @xmath17 , as illustrated by the arrows in the lower panel . </S>",
    "<S> note that the conservation of spectral weight dictates a weaker spectral weight for those `` main '' bands that develop stronger shadow bands . </S>",
    "<S> also associated with the shadow band formation are the additional gap openings occurring at the 2-fe bz boundaries , indicated by an ellipse in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2c as an example . obviously , the intensity of the shadow bands and gap opening size reflect ( although not necessarily represent fully ) the bands coupling to the broken symmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 shows clearly that the anion bands within [ -6 , -2 ] ev develop very strong shadows bands , of comparable intensity to the main bands . </S>",
    "<S> this reflects their strong coupling to the tsbp , as it is the alternating positioning of the anion that breaks the translational symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> given that one can hardly distinguish the main bands from the shadow bands , it is obviously more convenient to consider these anion bands in the 2-fe bz .    in great contrast , the fe bands near the fermi level have rather weak shadow bands . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , if it were nt for the gap openings ( some of which are quite large ) , the fe bands would have looked just like those from a simple 5-band system . </S>",
    "<S> the overall weak intensity of shadow bands explains why neutron spectra appear to respect the 1-fe bz : even though the real symmetry of the system dictates the 2-fe bz , the folding of the spectrum is just not strong enough for a clear experimental identification . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the lack of folded bands was also reported in a recent arpes experiment . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite consequently , a larger 1-fe bz is @xmath18 in future arpes measurements , since only about half of the ebss are clearly observable in the 2-fe bz , where most arpes to date were conducted .    fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 also reveals an interesting orbital - parity switching of the band folding , obvious from the change of color of the fe - bands . </S>",
    "<S> consider the fss , for example . </S>",
    "<S> the blue ( @xmath19 ) and red ( @xmath20 ) bands of odd parity w.r.t . </S>",
    "<S> the fe plane always have green ( @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 ) shadow bands of even parity , and _ </S>",
    "<S> vice versa_. this can be understood from the structure of tsbp in these systems . </S>",
    "<S> tab .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 gives the nearest neighbor hopping integrals for the low - energy fe @xmath1 bands in bafe@xmath24as@xmath24 after integrating out as @xmath4 orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> it shows that the alternating positioning of the anion ( c.f . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1a ) leads to an alternating sign of all @xmath25 , and thus breaks the translational symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , these terms form the main body of the tsbp , and dictate a switching of parity in the band character upon band folding . </S>",
    "<S> this novel behavior is quite distinct from the common cases of arpes , in which the replica of bands beyond the first bz retain the orbital character . here , the weak replica always possess a different character across the bz boundaries and thus require a different photon polarization to clearly observe , similar to the recent reports on bi@xmath24sr@xmath24cacu@xmath24o@xmath26 @xcite .    </S>",
