    "during the past few years , the prospect of probing ultra high energy physics ( on the order of the string / planck scale ) through precision cosmological observations has received much attention .",
    "while more traditional accelerator based approaches have the capacity to probe string physics only if the string scale proves to be in the tev range , the enormous stretching of distance scales in inflationary scenarios may well turn the cosmos into a _",
    "planck - scale _ microscope : in all but the most conservative of inflationary models , early - universe planck scale physics is stretched by cosmological expansion to scales relevant to the production of cmb temperature fluctuations @xcite .",
    "this suggests the tantalizing possibility that measurements of cmb anisotropies may be a window onto planck scale physics .",
    "the essential quantitative question facing this program is : how large are the contributions coming from string / planck scale physics , and are they large enough to be observed ?",
    "many authors , using a variety of approaches , have reached a range of conclusions .",
    "the most optimistic estimates have calculated transplanckian contributions to the cmb power spectrum ranging from @xmath0 to @xmath1 @xcite with @xmath2 the hubble scale at the end of inflation , while more pessimistic estimates @xcite suggest that the maximum contributions are order @xmath3 ( see further @xcite ) . with a favorable value of @xmath4",
    ", the former contribution would be on the edge of visibility @xcite , while the latter contributions ( without anomalously large coefficients ) would fall below the limit of cosmic variance . achieving consensus on the likely size of transplanckian corrections to the cmb power spectrum",
    "is thus an issue of great importance .    in this paper , we focus on transplanckian effects on the cmb coming from the well known and much studied ambiguity in choosing a vacuum state in a nontrivial cosmological space - time . by way of brief history , in @xcite a combination of such a modified vacuum state together with string - motivated modifications to the dynamical evolution equations were studied , with the conclusion that order @xmath5 corrections are generic . in @xcite and the third article of @xcite , it was emphasized that a modified vacuum state together with _ standard _",
    "evolution equations would also give rise to generic @xmath5 corrections , thus clarifying and simplifying the origin of transplanckian contributions of this magnitude .",
    "however , the papers @xcite , employing effective field theory techniques , argued that the standard vacuum state ( bunch - davies boundary conditions ) would yield the far smaller @xmath6 contributions , and that , moreover , any other choice for the boundary conditions would fall prey to uncontrollable backreaction in the absence of fine tuning . inspired in part by @xcite , in @xcite a quantitative formalism for studying the ambiguity in cosmological initial conditions in the context of boundary effective field theory was put forward .",
    "it was argued that the integrating out of high energy modes _ generically _ modifies the boundary conditions of the resulting low energy effective field theory .",
    "importantly , the size of the corrections was found to be of order @xmath5 , agreeing with the early papers on high energy effects on the vacuum choice , but with calculations carried out in a controlled approximation . moreover , the boundary effective action provided new counterterms that would render the gravitational backreaction under control for choices other than bunch - davies boundary conditions .",
    "subsequently , an order of magnitude estimate of the now manifestly finite backreaction @xcite argued that the observed slow - roll period of inflation significantly bounds the size of potential transplanckian signatures in the cmb anisotropy .    in this paper , armed with the quantitative boundary effective field theory framework",
    ", we extend the work of @xcite and @xcite by carefully calculating the gravitational backreaction .",
    "seeking fully unambigous backreaction constraints  backreaction contributions that are not subject to any renormalization ambiguities and hence are fully interpretable in the effective field theory framework  we find robust conclusions on the size of transplanckian cmb corrections .",
    "in particular , the existence of new counterterms has the potential to subdue the order of magnitude estimate of the one - loop backreaction to the point that there are no bounds of consequence on potential corrections to the observed power spectrum for @xmath7 . without additional information from a proposed uv - completion of our effective field theory description  one that would allow a more refined estimate of the gravitational backreaction  we conclude that backreaction constraints are under control for parameter ranges that can , in principle , yield observable consequences for the cosmic microwave background radiation . barring a cosmological observation more sensitive to high - energy corrections to the initial state , the theoretical window of opportunity to observe short distance physics in the cmb is thus open .",
    "in section [ sec : beft ] we review the results of @xcite that provide a new formalism to address the initial state ambiguity in cosmological space - times in a coherent lagrangian effective field theory description .",
    "the initial state can be encoded in a ( space - like ) boundary action at an a priori arbitrary initial time @xmath8 . from the standard hamiltonian perspective",
    ", this corresponds to scenarios where the bogoliubov coefficients parameterizing the initial state ambiguity are allowed to vary with co - moving momentum @xmath9 .",
    "the distinct advantage of the lagrangian effective field theory approach is that it is the natural framework to consider effects of high energy physics ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it allows one to neglect momentum modes beyond the high energy cut - off in a manifestly consistent way and it provides a _ quantitative _ understanding of effects due to uv physics . specifically , it recasts the momentum - dependence of the initial state into a well - defined expansion in irrelevant operators parameterizing unknown high - energy physics .",
    "the leading effect of high - energy physics arises from these irrelevant corrections to the boundary action rather than from higher derivative corrections in the bulk ( which were analyzed in @xcite ) .",
    "the leading irrelevant operator on the three - dimensional boundary is dimension four .",
    "corrections to the inflationary power spectrum therefore behave parametrically as @xmath10 , which can conceivably be as high as 1% .",
    "this renders them potentially observable in future cmb measurements .      as we will discuss in [ sec : an - earliest - time ] , an immediate consequence of the effective field theory framework in a cosmological context  of demanding that all the momentum modes under consideration are _ always _ smaller than the physical cutoff scale  is the existence of an ` earliest time ' before which the effective field theory breaks down .",
    "this earliest time depends on the momentum scale of interest and roughly corresponds to @xmath11 e - folds before horizon exit of the smallest observable length scale in the cmb .",
    "it is the natural location to set the initial conditions .",
    ", the lowest modes observable in the cmb  four orders of magnitude below the smallest observable mode  have already exited the horizon @xmath12 e - folds earlier .",
    "usually horizon exit is interpreted as modes ceasing to be dynamical and being frozen out .",
    "if this interpretation is truly correct , how can these modes account for low multipole cmb fluctuations ? at face value ,",
    "1 ) the imposition of boundary conditions at a fixed ` earliest ' time , 2 ) the non - uniform times @xmath13 when each individual mode is of the order of the cut - off and @xmath14 when it exits the horizon , and 3 ) the wish to describe the full range of observed modes in the cmb at once , are in tension with each other . for the power spectrum we can circumvent this conflict as",
    "a linear analysis is sufficient .",
    "modes do not interact , and one can set the initial conditions for each mode at different times . for an interacting field theory it is open question , however , how to resolve the tension between 1 ) , 2 ) and 3 ) . ]    by doing so , we find that the current measurements of the power spectrum of cmb fluctuations already provide a strong bound on the _ coefficient _ @xmath15 of the leading irrelevant operator in the boundary effective action if @xmath16 .",
    "this is directly related to the fact that the initial state deduced from the boundary effective field theory will generically break de sitter scale invariance , ( i.e. the bogoliubov coefficients depend on the co - moving momentum scale in hamiltonian language ) .",
    "roughly put , the effect of the leading irrelevant boundary operator adds a linear component @xmath17 to the power spectrum , where @xmath18 is the scale factor at the ` earliest time ' .",
    "the change to the power spectrum is thus parametrically controlled by @xmath19 , but at the high end of the spectrum it can be significantly larger than that ( figure [ fig:2 ] in section [ sec : an - earliest - time ] ) .",
    "this linear growth is not present in the observed cmb spectrum ; it is nearly scale invariant over the full observed range .",
    "this rules out a coefficient @xmath15 much larger than @xmath20 .",
    "we see that an earliest time has as primary consequence that inflation s usual classical independence of initial conditions is modified as the quantum mechanical boundary conditions affect late - time physics .",
    "in particular , if the modes responsible for the cmb perturbations that we can measure today exited the horizon a sufficiently small number of e - foldings after the earliest time hypersurface , then sensitivity to initial conditions can persist .",
    "nevertheless , the cosmological dynamics that result from the classical background motion of the scalar field are still expected to be independent of the initial conditions @xcite .      naturally , all other  measured",
    " cosmological quantities will also be affected by the irrelevant boundary operators and observability therefore hinges on whether other phenomenological constraints are mild enough to allow a 1% change to the power spectrum .",
    "in particular , @xcite argued that an order of magnitude estimate of the gravitational backreaction yields constraints on transplanckian calculations that are quite significant .",
    "we compute here the gravitational backreaction in detail .",
    "the resulting perturbative bound on the coefficient @xmath15 of the leading irrelevant boundary operator , @xmath21 plus the constraints from the observed inflationary slow - roll parameters @xmath22 @xmath23 gev , the scale of new physics @xmath24 gev , and the reduced planck mass @xmath25 gev , they allow a significant observational window of opportunity . the mildness results from the fact that the first unambiguous contribution to the backreaction is only at _ second _ order in the irrelevant correction ( this had earlier been argued by tanaka @xcite . indeed compared to the order of magnitude estimate @xcite the above three equations are effectively the same with @xmath26 substituted for @xmath15 . )",
    "the backreaction due to the first order correction , though not zero , is essentially localized on the boundary and therefore subject to the subtraction prescription utilized to renormalize the theory .",
    "the localization is a consequence of the highly oscillatory nature of the first order power - spectrum . when integrated , all contributions cancel except in a neighborhood of the boundary . in the context of effective field theory",
    " the only context we consider in this paper  such terms are subject to renormalization via boundary counterterms and hence their contribution is ambiguous .",
    "by contrast , the second order effect which remains and dominates is the ` time - averaged ' energy stored in the oscillatory behavior itself , which gives a contribution whose scale is controlled by @xmath2 and hence is clearly physical . in particular , this contribution grows as the square of the amplitude rather than linearly , and it is this which accounts for the appearance of @xmath27 rather than @xmath28 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:260a])-  ( [ eq:12 ] ) above .",
    "the bounds on the coefficient @xmath15 due to the one - loop backreaction are in fact so mild that they are superseded by the direct sensitivity of the power spectrum .",
    "the aforementioned existence of an earliest time and its concomitant bound on @xmath29 implies that backreaction poses _ no _ constraints if @xmath10 is large enough ( figure [ fig:2 ] in section [ sec : an - earliest - time ] ) .",
    "the bounds on @xmath15 from backreaction are weaker than the direct ` search ' upper bound from the power - spectrum , allowing for the possibility of non - trivial implications for cmb observations .",
    "the calculation of irrelevant contributions to the one - loop backreaction does make clear that the presence of irrelevant corrections to the bunch - davies boundary action must amount to an extra vacuum energy presence in the space - time .",
    "the non - localized second order contribution to the backreaction redshifts away as any other energy density .",
    "qualitatively this indicates that the effective action has a limited range of applicability to the far past to where the quantum vacuum energy overwhelms the classical one , as has been argued in @xcite .",
    "the boundary action formalism allows a quantitative calculation of this range of applicability .",
    "one finds that the excess energy stored in the initial state only dominates _ before _ the earliest time where the effective action ceases to be valid . within this formalism",
    "we are therefore intrinsically unable to answer what happens before that moment .",
    "this is not to say that the criticism that the excess energy could ruin inflation a few @xmath30-folds further back is without merit .",
    "this is certainly an issue , and one that would need to be addressed by fully fundamental description . but within the framework of a low energy effective action it is an issue that we need not , and in fact , can not address : by definition one can not answer any questions outside the effective field theory s range of validity .",
    "the whole framework is therefore self - consistent , and it crucially hinges on the existence of an earliest time . within this range of validity backreaction never gets out of hand .    beyond consistency",
    ", one might worry about fine - tuning : how finely do we have to tune the initial state to obtain observably large transplanckian effects in the cmb without falling afoul of a theoretical or phenomenological constraint ?",
    "we will address this briefly in the conclusion , section [ sec : conclusion ] . a fine - tuning requirement itself",
    "is no phenomenological constraint , however , but a theoretical prejudice .",
    "it is not related to consistency of the boundary effective action framework or phenomenological bounds on potential short distance effects in the cmb .",
    "for this reason we postpone a full accounting of fine - tuning issues to a separate article .",
    "since energy is stored in the initial state , this does show that a non standard choice of initial conditions necessarily corresponds to a state differing from the adiabatic ground state of the system .",
    "the irrelevant corrections to the initial state therefore parameterize deviations from adiabaticity .",
    "the above demonstrates that the use of a boundary effective action to parameterize the cosmological vacuum ambiguity , allows us to _ quantitatively and reliably _ describe and compute high energy corrections to low energy and late time cosmological physics , including those to the initial conditions .",
    "the calculations confirm qualitative estimates about phenomenological constraints on irrelevant non - adiabatic corrections to the initial state , with important caveats .",
    "the backreaction is only significantly affected at second order .",
    "hence 1 ) the size of phenomenologically allowed irrelevant corrections is significantly larger than dimensional analysis would suggest and 2 ) for @xmath31 the inflationary power spectrum of fluctuations itself is the most sensitive measurement of irrelevant corrections to the initial conditions . in particular the corrections to the power spectrum",
    "are allowed to be of order 1% without significantly disturbing the inflationary background .",
    "as a consequence backreaction poses little constraint and initial state corrections due to the irrelevant operators could be large enough to be observed . indeed given that the backreaction bounds are so weak , the observed scale invariance of the cmb bounds @xmath32 _ directly .",
    "for simplicity we will consider an external scalar field in conformal gauge de sitter .",

    ". in general one is always free to use whatever cut - off function one fancies , provided it renders all green s functions finite . in practice one chooses one that respects the most symmetries of the theory : this guarantees that the ward identities are manifestly obeyed in the regulated theory .",

    "a qualitative way to understand better what is happening is to not modify the kinetic term explicitly , but rather implicitly through a change in the fields @xmath164 this suggests a ( qualitative ) change for the cosmological mode functions @xmath165 the green s function is therefore modified to @xmath166 inferring from the relation between the stress - tensor expectation value and the green s function , @xmath167 , one is inclined to use a naive regulating function @xmath168 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:21 ] ) .",
    "this is _ not _ correct . when the change in the boundary condition is treated as a perturbation ,",

    "the counterintuitive answer obtained for @xmath138 with a physical cut - off @xmath169 is a manifestation of using this wrong cut - off .    according to the above",

    "( [ eq:21 ] ) is @xmath170 the time - dependence in the ratio @xmath171 which smoothly interpolates between two and unity is clearly not relevant .",
    "let us now proceed and calculate the dominant , non - oscillatory , second order contribution to the backreaction ( [ eq:160 ] ) .",

    "they differ of course at the subleading level , as an exact calculation shows .",
    "the time behavior of the answer is fundamentally different from the first order term ( [ eq:24 ] ) .",
    "this can be attributed to the non - oscillatory behavior of the integrand .",
    "the backreaction still decays exponentially fast away from the position of the boundary , but now with the hubble scale @xmath2 rather than the cut - off scale @xmath48 .",
    "as this contribution is clearly unaffected by both the renormalization prescription of the bulk stress tensor ( a constant time - independent term ) and the boundary stress tensor ( a localized term scaling with the cut - off @xmath155 ) , it unmistakably corresponds to a physical contribution .",
    "hence an irrelevant perturbation away from the bd - state introduces an excess amount of physical energy density @xcite . as time",
    "progresses this energy density red - shifts due to the ds exponential expansion , explaining the exponential decay with scale @xmath2 . because this contribution entails a physical change in the background , the observed cosmology constrains the size the coefficient @xmath15 of the irrelevant operator .",
    "the question is whether these constraints ( dis)allow potentially observable corrections to the cmb .      aside from determining phenomenological constraints on possible high - energy physics effects in the cmb",
    ", the calculation of the one - loop backreaction elucidates a theoretical argument as well . by consensus",
    "the preferred vacuum state in cosmological settings is the adiabatic one .",
    "this state is defined as that state in which the number operator decreases slowest with time .",
    "this is a somewhat uncomfortable definition as the number operator is not an observable quantity .",
    "its observable counterpart , however , is the normal - ordered hamiltonian , i.e. the renormalized stress tensor .",
    "an improved definition of the adiabatic initial conditions is those for which the ( one - loop ) stress - tensor changes slowest in time .",
    "as our calculation clearly shows , any irrelevant perturbation away from the bd - initial conditions will introduce a scaling @xmath174 .",
    "hence we recover that the bd - initial conditions are the adiabatic ones .",
    "moreover irrelevant corrections to the bd - state quantitatively parameterize deviations away from adiabaticity .",
    "this quantitative understanding of non - adiabatic initial states ( indeed the presence of irrelevant operators means that the theory is not renormalizable and decoupling no longer works exactly ) and the consequent time - dependence of the stress - tensor illustrates an interesting new contribution to the standard slow - roll inflationary scenario ( see the recent article @xcite for a qualitatively similar viewpoint ) . as a variant of one - loop induced inflationary potentials , the above computation shows how non - adiabaticity can be responsible for deviations from the classically expected scale - invariant de sitter spectrum .",
    "such non - adiabatic contributions to inflationary evolution are arguably natural in the interpretation of cosmological evolution as relaxation towards a ground state .",
    "experimental evidence , however , ought to judge the full validity of such a ` relaxation'-scenario . in the next section",
    "we will discuss to what extent deviations from adiabaticity , i.e. the contribution to the power spectrum from boundary irrelevant operators , contribute to the inflationary evolution and are constrained by current observation .",
    "these constraints will follow from comparing the measured vs. predicted gravitational background .",
    "we have already shown the results of this calculation in the right panel of figure [ fig:2 ] where we compare them with the direct observational bounds from the power spectrum plus a constraint on the maximal value of @xmath10 .",
    "let us now show , how we arrived at the bounds in figure [ fig:2 ] .",
    "the friedmann equation relates the measured full quantum corrected hubble scale @xmath175 to the expectation value of the stress - tensor @xmath176 here @xmath177 corresponds to the @xmath178-loop order @xmath179 irrelevant corrections to the backreaction , and @xmath180 equals the reduced planck mass @xmath181 gev .",
    "we have shown earlier that @xmath182 is localized on the boundary and , concentrating only on the leading @xmath183 contributions , that the @xmath184 term is constant at this order and fixed by the renormalization prescription .",
    "we will therefore ignore their contributions from here on .",
    "@xmath185 is of course the classical background and at leading order @xmath183 , @xmath186 follows from ( [ eq:190 ] ) @xmath187 with @xmath188 the classical hubble scale .",
    "the first constraint is simply that of a consistent perturbation theory , i.e. that the one - loop backreaction term @xmath186 should be small compared to the measured expansion rate of the universe @xmath189 this constraint is strongest at the ` earliest time ' @xmath190 where we set the initial conditions .",
    "we see that @xmath191 . in conventional string scenario ,",
    "the string scale is roughly two orders of magnitude below the ( reduced ) planck scale which gives @xmath192 for @xmath193 gev .",
    "this establishes our claim that the backreaction constraint has no practical content for @xmath194 . with the numbers used for @xmath2 and @xmath48 the power spectrum already constrains @xmath195",
    "the reason why this is so , is also evident .",
    "the weakness of the backreaction constraint is a result of the cancellation of the highly oscillatory integrand .",
    "the power spectrum , however , is roughly the integrand of the one - loop backreaction . for the power spectrum",
    ", the oscillations do not cancel each other , which explains the higher sensitivity compared to the backreaction constraint .",
    "in addition to this ` static ' backreaction constraint , one should also demand that the time derivatives of the backreaction are not too big .",
    "these are the phenomenological parameters that determine the characteristics of the inflationary evolution .",
    "through one - loop backreaction the boundary irrelevant operators will contribute to these , as we anticipated in section [ sec : adiab - init - cond ] .",
    "the derivatives must remain small enough , however , to guarantee that inflation lasted long enough and to explain the measured scale - invariance of the spectrum .",
    "the ( first ) time - derivative of the stress tensor is related to the conventional inflationary slow - roll parameter @xmath196 as @xmath197 . to guarantee",
    "inflation @xmath198 should be smaller than @xmath199 @xmath200 for the classical de - sitter background used here @xmath201 which implies the following constraint on @xmath15 ( again evaluated close to the boundary ) @xmath202 we conclude that @xmath203 , which is again superseded by the power spectrum sensitivity itself .",
    "finally the measured scale invariance of the power spectrum constrains the second time derivative of the backreaction .",
    "place no phenomenological constraints on the value of @xmath15 .",
    "an observed running of the spectral index would bound the third derivative as well . ]",
    "it is related to a combination of the first and the second slow - roll parameter @xmath204 .",
    "we deduce @xmath205 for a general slow - roll inflationary background this will lead to the following constraint on @xmath15 , @xmath206 this is clearly our strongest constraint . using the same estimates as before and in addition assuming that @xmath207 , we approximately find @xmath208 , but this number could vary somewhat depending on the precise estimates . yet",
    "the power spectrum constraint is again stronger .",
    "eqs ( [ eq:210])-  ( [ eq:31 ] ) are the bounds we have drawn in the right panel of figure [ fig:2 ] . for comparison we have also shown the order of magnitude estimates made in @xcite . mathematically the latter do correspond to the first order one - loop correction to the backreaction .",
    "we have shown , however , how this contribution is localized on the boundary where one sets the initial conditions . it is therefore subject to a renormalization ambiguity .",
    "the second order contribution is physical but its constraints are a lot milder and are not threatening the potential observability of initial state corrections in the cmb .",
    "they clearly leave a large window of opportunity for a significant range of values of @xmath10 where irrelevant corrections will affect the cmb .",
    "precisely the fact that non - bunch - davies initial conditions ought to correspond to a quantum physical contribution to the stress tensor has been used as a qualitative argument that irrelevant corrections to the initial conditions can not be large enough to be potentially observable . the energy present in the initial state",
    "would _ blueshift _ towards the past and rapidly invalidate the classical inflationary background used . since we need roughly sixty e - folds of inflation to explain the observed flatness and isotropy of our universe this would be problematic . with the quantitative boundary effective formalism to encode the initial conditions we can investigate this issue more deeply .",
    "indeed the scaling with @xmath2 of the second order correction to the stress tensor implies that for nonzero @xmath15 there is an excess physical energy present on top of the classical background .",
    "this backreaction starts to dominate over the classical background when @xmath209 with @xmath210 the total number of e - folds _ before _ the ` earliest time ' . only for very small values of @xmath10",
    "is this number @xmath211 negative . for the range of values @xmath10 of interest",
    "the time where backreaction starts to dominate is therefore _ before _",
    "the ` earliest time ' where one can start to trust the cosmological low energy effective action . what truly happens before the ` earliest time ' is unanswerable within the low energy effective framework .",
    "this does not mean that the energy that is stored in the initial state miraculously disappears or is not an backreaction issue before time @xmath39 .",
    "it does mean that we need to know the short distance completion of the theory to answer this criticism . within the range of validity of the effective action after the ` earliest time '",
    "the backreaction is always a small perturbation on the classical background .",
    "the cosmological low energy effective action with boundary is consistent .",
    "a separate criticism argued that irrelevant corrections to the initial conditions were necessarily fine tuned .",
    "we will answer this elsewhere ; a first estimate is made in @xcite .",
    "one noted fine tuning objection : that any momentum dependent feature in the power spectrum must be fine tuned as we only measure a narrow ten @xmath30-fold window of the full power spectrum produced during inflation , does not hold here .",
    "it is a straightforward exercise to show that any irrelevant operator will introduce a power dependence in the spectrum .",
    "moreover , following the precepts of effective action this momentum dependence occurs in a well - defined derivative expansion which predicts outwardly differing but intrinsically universal results for any ten e - fold window of the power spectrum .",
    "the main conclusion stemming from this work is that the unambiguous backreaction constraints on the irrelevant operator coefficient are mild and do not affect the potential observability of the initial state corrections in the cmb .",
    "the three constraints arising from the observed slow - roll inflationary phase read @xmath212 typical , although slightly optimistic , estimates imply that @xmath213 and @xmath214 .",
    "the constraints on @xmath27 thus range from @xmath215 , @xmath216 to @xmath217 .",
    "these numbers could easily change by an order of magnitude by slightly changing the precise parameter estimates , so there is some room for adjustment in these constraints .",
    "this is plotted in figure [ fig:2 ] . nevertheless , using the suggested parameter estimates , order one coefficients for @xmath15 are still allowed by these constraints .",
    "indeed the observability of the initial state corrections in the cmb is not ruled out .",
    "rather the power spectrum itself places stronger constraints on @xmath15 .",
    "we have moreover shown that the irrelevant corrections to the boundary effective action encoding the initial conditions parameterize deviations from adiabaticity .",
    "they correspond to having an excited energetic initial state . though this energy could cause a problem when blueshifted to the past , within the framework of the low energy effective action it is always perturbative .",
    "this ensures consistency of the cosmological low energy effective action including high energy induced irrelevant corrections to the initial state .",
    "the burning question is whether these short distance corrections are actually decipherable from cmb data .",
    "similar to earlier predictions of the contribution to the power spectrum , we find that the leading irrelevant boundary operator yields a characteristic oscillatory signature . in principle",
    "this ought to make these corrections uniquely identifiable in the data .",
    "sensitivity studies in a specific uv - complete framework appear to bear this out @xcite . as figure [ fig:2 ] shows , however , the leading irrelevant correction alone induces a very rapid oscillation period for those modes where the amplitude is large enough . from eq .",
    "( [ eq:3c ] ) we see that its frequency is about @xmath218 .",
    "this is probably too rapid to be resolved in the actual data .",
    "it is difficult to make a concrete statement , though . in the end",
    "only a full deconvolving of the actual measured data with respect to the template provided here , can yield an answer to the question whether the accuracy with which the data is collected can uniquely identify the contributions from short distance corrections to the initial state .",
    "this is a calculation we intend to return to .",
    "let us finally mention that it would be extremely interesting if one could calculate the coefficients @xmath15 from first principles .",
    "for this we need to know the uv completion of the theory .",
    "for instance , it could be interesting to study some of the recently proposed string inflationary scenarios @xcite to see whether one could explicitly calculate the coefficients of some of the irrelevant operators in this context . with a uv - completion in hand , one could moreover compute the unambiguous answer for the first - order backreaction .",

    "<S> we clarify the status of transplanckian effects on the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy . we do so using the boundary effective action formalism of hep - th/0401164 which accounts quantitatively for the cosmological vacuum ambiguity . in this formalism </S>",
    "<S> we can clearly 1 ) delineate the validity of cosmological effective actions in an expanding universe . </S>",
    "<S> the corollary of the initial state ambiguity is the existence of an earliest time . </S>",
    "<S> the inability of an effective action to describe physics before this time demands that one sets initial conditions on the earliest time hypersurface . </S>",
    "<S> a calculation then shows that cmb anisotropy measurements are generically sensitive to high energy corrections to the initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) we compute the one - loop contribution to the stress - tensor due to high - energy physics corrections to an arbitrary cosmological initial state . </S>",
    "<S> we find that phenomenological bounds on the backreaction do not lead to strong constraints on the coefficient of the leading boundary irrelevant operator . </S>",
    "<S> rather , we find that the power spectrum itself is the quantity most sensitive to initial state corrections . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) the computation of the one - loop backreaction confirms arguments that irrelevant corrections to the bunch - davies initial state yield non - adiabatic vacua characterized by an energy excess at some earlier time . </S>",
    "<S> however , this excess only dominates over the classical background at times before the ` earliest time ' at which the effective action is valid . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the cosmological effective action with boundaries is a fully self - consistent and quantitative approach to transplanckian corrections to the cmb . </S>"
