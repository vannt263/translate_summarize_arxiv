    "there are many ways to deal with the issue of quantum - classical correspondence @xcite . in the most common and traditional view",
    "the classical limit corresponds to @xmath1 , or , invoking the bohr correspondence principle , the principal quantum number of a system @xmath2 , or regarding the coherent state as the ` most classical ' quantum state , or the wigner function as the ` closest to classical ' distribution .",
    "less precise criteria also abound , such as the loose concept that a system at high temperature behaves classically , or viewing the thermodynamic / hydrodynamic limits ( of a quantum system ) as classical .",
    "( for a description of the various criteria , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there are holes in almost all of the above common beliefs .",
    "a more sophisticated viewpoint invokes decoherence , the process whereby a quantum system loses its coherence ( measured by its quantum phase information ) through interaction with its environment @xcite . in this work",
    "we examine an alternative perspective , as the folklore goes , that quantum pertains to the small ( mass , scale ) while classical to the large ( size , multiplicity ) . this common belief",
    "now requires a much closer scrutiny in the face of new challenges from macroscopic quantum phenomena ( mqp ) , viz , quantum features may show up even at macroscopic scales .",
    "a common example is superconductivity where the cooper pairs can extend to very large scales compared to interatomic distances and bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) where a large number n of atoms occupy the same quantum state , the n - body ground state .",
    "other examples include nanoelectromechanical devices @xcite where the center of mass of a macroscopic classical object , the cantilever , obeys a quantum mechanical equation of motion .",
    "experiments to demonstrate the quantum features such as the existence of interference between two macroscopic objects have been carried out , e.g. , for @xmath3 molecules passing through two slits @xcite or proposed , e.g. , for two mirrors @xcite .",
    "a most direct account of the difference between the microscopic and the macroscopic behaviours of a quantum system is by examining n , the number of physically relevant ( e.g. for atomic systems , forgetting about the tighter - bound substructures ) quantum particles or components in a macroscopic object .",
    "one may ask : at what number of n will it be suitable to describe the object as mesoscopic with qualitatively distinct features from microscopic and macroscopic ? in the case of classical equilibrium statistical mechanics this issue is easily addressed by use of the ( grand ) canonical ensemble , and such inquiry is answered by understanding how the ( grand ) partition function behaves as a function of n and temperature @xmath4 ( and chemical potential @xmath5 ) all the way to the thermodynamic limit . in classical nonequilibrium statistical mechanics ,",
    "this issue underlies the derivation from molecular hamiltonian dynamics the thermodynamic and kinetic properties ( such as transport functions ) of a gas of n molecules , and their dynamics , which possess salient dissipative and time - asymmetry features nonexistent in the microscopic dynamics .",
    "boltzmann answered this question with great valour and magnificent success , bringing forth also the issue of time - arrow and providing a molecular dynamics basis for the second law . to perform a quantitative analysis of such issues one needs to work with kinetic and stochastic equations for the n particles , the boltzmann equation -bbgky hierarchy for ( effectively ) closed systems in the case where there is no distinguished party , and when there is , the langevin equation for open systems .",
    "in the recent decade significant advances have been made in providing a molecular dynamics basis to the foundations of thermodynamics @xcite , relating the macroscopic thermodynamic behaviour of a gas to the chaotic dynamics of its molecular constituents .",
    "one could even calculate the range in the number of molecules where a microscopic system begins to acquire macroscopic behaviour and hence identify the approximate boundaries of mesoscopia @xcite .    for quantum systems one needs to deal with additional concerns of quantum coherence and entanglement which are critically important issues in quantum information processing ( qip ) @xcite .",
    "a fundamental issue in qip is how the performance of a quantum information processor alters as one scales the system up .",
    "this dependence on n is known as the  scaling \" problem @xcite .",
    "we will defer considerations of quantum entanglement of macroscopic objects to a third paper in this series after we have a chance to explore how quantum correlations and fluctuations impact on mqp in the second paper using the n particle - irreducible ( npi ) representation .",
    "there are many important and interesting issues of mqp , one subset of special interest to us is how quantum expresses itself in the macroscopic domain since usually macro conjures classicality .",
    "thus even the simplest yet far from naive question need be reconsidered properly .",
    "for example , why is it that an ostensibly macroscopic object such as a cantilever should follow a quantum equation of motion .",
    "this center - of - mass axiom is implicitly assumed in many descriptions of mqp but rarely justified .",
    "the conditions upon which this can be justified are provided by two of us and a different third author @xcite with the derivation of a master equation for n harmonic oscillators ( nho ) in a finite temperature harmonic oscillator bath .    in this paper",
    "we ask the question : when will a quantum system of n particles or components begin to acquire or show classical features .",
    "we shall present an array of physical examples to illustrate how this comes about , and glean from them 1 ) how classicality is defined , 2 ) how the meaning of classicality changes in different types of theories ?",
    "for 1 ) the criteria mentioned at the beginning and expounded further in the next section will be invoked in several concrete examples , such as , how the inflaton dynamics determines when the inflationary universe begins to behave classically , from the simplest criteria ( invoking the uncertainty principle ) to the more involved ( correlation between canonical variables ) and sophisticated ( decoherence ) .",
    "other criteria studied are randomization of quantum phase , entropy generation , decoherence of hydrodynamic variables due to the existence of conservation laws . for 2 )",
    "we give a detailed study of a ) the o(n ) model : an n component quantum scalar field @xmath6 with @xmath7 self interaction ( in section  [ sec : onlargen ] ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the quantum mechanical version of which describes a system of n interacting quantum harmonic oscillators , as it is the common underlying structure of many physical examples , where some claims of macrocity ( being macroscopic , for lack of a better noun ) and classicality originate . for our purpose",
    "here it is sufficient to work with a zero - dimensional field theory , i.e. , a quantum mechanical model  not only can one shred off the shrouded field theory technicalities but it is more directly related to atomic - optical and condensed matter set - ups for easier experimental comparisons .",
    "b ) semiclassical stochastic gravity @xcite , and c ) gauge / string theory ( in section  [ sec : nloln ] ) .",
    "we use some well - known results in quantum field theory - the large n expansion  to consider mean field behaviour and under what conditions the semiclassical limit of a quantum theory will be reached at the leading order ( lo ) large n expansion , and the role of quantum fluctuations at the next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) large n expansion .    both the o(n ) theory and semiclassical gravity show semiclassical behaviour when n becomes very large . for the former the leading order large n expansion yields a mean field theory with vlasov equation which is time - reversal invariant .",
    "we use this model as an example to expound these issues in section  [ sec : loln ] . the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) expansion begins to show dissipative behaviour in the two particle irreducible ( 2pi ) representation @xcite . using the closed - time - path ( ctp ) 2pi nlo effective action",
    "an h - theorem can be shown to exist for the quantum mechanical o(n ) model @xcite . in the latter example",
    ", perturbative quantum gravity interacting with an n component quantum scalar field emerges as the semiclassical limit when n becomes very large @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion ( semiclassical einstein equation ) is time - reversal invariant . the nlo expansion yields stochastic gravity @xcite which has both dissipative and fluctuation features .",
    "these prior results provide a stimulus for us to inquire about the quantum - classical correspondence issue in an alternative way , i.e. , instead of using the loop expansion ( in orders of @xmath8 ) where quantum features reveal at successively higher loop orders as corrections to the classical solution , we use the large n expansion , where n provides a quantitative measure of the ` magnitude ' or ` complexity ' of a quantum system , to examine how the semiclassical limit of a quantum theory is reached .",
    "we shall rely heavily on the results obtained in @xcite to illustrate these crucial aspects in mqp .",
    "however , as the examples in gauge and string theory show @xcite ( section  [ sec : nloln ] ) the leading order large n does not necessarily correspond to a classical limit .",
    "it may correspond to a thermodynamics limit instead .",
    "these are the purposes for our invoking different theories to illustrate different criteria and see their fine and not so fine distinctions .",
    "perhaps it is necessary to make this remark here before we describe the contents of this paper : many ingredients in our discussions are well - known to different communities , such as the large n expansion in field theory and critical phenomena , dissipation and fluctuations in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics , stochastic equations in quantum open systems , hydrodynamic variables and quasi - classical domains in decoherent histories , etc .",
    "we see this paper s contribution is a modest one : discerning the physical essence of apparently similar technology and sharpening the often mixed - up physical meanings while focusing on the issues interspersed between the macro and the quantum .",
    "we hope to use these well - known parts to elucidate some lesser known , even misunderstood facts , and to shape a new perspective , as a first step towards constructing a theoretical foundation for mqp .",
    "readers familiar with these theories should just skip over the technical details in those parts and concentrate on how they bring out the physical issues raised . in section  [ sec : lnqc ]",
    "we display an array of criteria behind the common beliefs pertaining to quantum , classical and macro , draw the linkages between them , differentiate seemingly equivalent criteria , and issue some warnings to over - generalizations . in section",
    "[ sec : onlargen ] we present a ) the @xmath0 model , give a quick summary of the large n expansion method , leading to a set of coupled equations where one can see the variation with n in physical quantities of interest . in section  [ sec : loln ] we use three examples to describe how a macroscopic quantum system acquires classical features : 1 ) the so - called ` quantum roll ' model of inflationary cosmology @xcite based on the @xmath0 model , how stringent the different classicality criteria are : amongst them the use of the uncertainty relation , correlation in conjugate variables , and environment - induced decoherence .",
    "2 ) quantum vlasov equation ( qve ) as an example of a mean field theory obtained from the leading order large n ( loln ) expansion of the @xmath0 model .",
    "following @xcite we express qve as a coupled set of equations , one for the number of particles , the other for their correlations which contain quantum phase relations .",
    "this enables one to see how coarse - graining over the phase information brings about entropy generation which is related to uncertainty which can be used to quantify classicality .",
    "we also mention how in the decoherent history conceptual framework quasi - classical domains can appear owing to the existence of conservation laws for hydrodynamic variables , thus highlighting the role of emergence and importance of collective behaviour in mqp . in section  [ sec : nloln ] we consider the next - to - leading order large n expansion and try to identify the role of quantum fluctuations in mqp , using examples given above to make explicit the conditions a macroscopic system can shred off or retain its quantum features .",
    "we use two more illustrative theories here , b ) semiclassical stochastic gravity and c ) gauge / string theories to examine their loln and nlo dynamics and explore their classical versus quantum behaviours .",
    "we learned that there is no a priori reason why a quantum system with large n need to be classical .",
    "we discuss the differences in physical meaning between a mean field and a classical field , and under what conditions the former leads to the latter . only for the class of gaussian theories like the o(n ) model where the mean field theory obtained from the loln expansion is equivalent to the classical theory",
    "would it make sense to think of deviations ( from lo expansion ) from the mean as providing the quantum corrections which then allows one to use large n to address the quantum- classical correspondence issue . in section  [ sec : conclusion ]",
    "we summarize what we have learned in this intellectual exercise and make some general observations .",
    "the overall lesson we learned is that we need to be very careful in finding the conditions and formulating criteria for a system with large n to behave classically . to be safe",
    ", one should think of all systems as quantum intrinsically at all orders of n , and not to identify mean field as classical without knowing the structure and behavior of the theories we are talking about .",
    "in this program we have set up for ourselves we need to clearly distinguish the relation between micro - macro / quantum - classical as well as the thermo - hydro limits .",
    "the micro - macro correspondence underlies the basic theme of statistical mechanics which has been investigated for centuries , and although mesoscopic physics has been with us for three decades many key issues bearing on quantum correlations and fluctuations remain a challenge today .",
    "the quantum - classical transition /correspondence has been studied in earnest in the last two decades and we have gained much understanding of the role environments play in bringing about a quantum system s classical behaviour , but the issue of quantum and macro remains little explored , since most common beliefs associate micro with quantum and macro with classical .",
    "mqp is a strong statement that this need not be the case .",
    "we ought to scrutinize all conventional assumptions and reexamine every single concept and criterion before reconnecting them into a new conceptual framework to meet this new challenge . as a background for motivation and a collection of key points we list below the common beliefs for a macroscopic object to assume classical behaviour .",
    "we pay special attention to the relation of large n , quantum and classicality .",
    "* why is it that @xmath1 is often viewed as classical ?",
    "this can be easily seen from the path integral formalism : @xmath10 multiplies the action in the path integral , which has no further dependence on @xmath9 . the dominant contribution to",
    "the path integral comes from the path which extremizes the action , i.e. , the classical trajectory .",
    "the steepest descent method becomes exact when @xmath1 .",
    "it is in this sense that taking @xmath1 give rise to classical physics .",
    "+ suppose the macroscopic object is made up of a space - time inhomogeneous boson condensate .",
    "its classical behaviour manifests itself via the vacuum expectation value of a scalar field @xmath11 : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the vacuum with the space - time inhomogeneous boson condensate creating the macroscopic object .",
    "note that @xmath14 contains not only @xmath15 , but also the product of normal product terms .",
    "rearranging a product of normal product terms into a normal product creates c - numbers due to the contraction of creation and annihilation operators , while each contraction creates a c - number of order @xmath9 , namely , @xmath16 thus only when the contractions which produce the loops in the feynman diagrams are ignored can one replace @xmath17 by @xmath15 .",
    "this gives the tree level approximation which is usually termed  classical \" .",
    "* _ fluctuations to mean _ : bohr s correspondence principle states that the classical behaviour of a quantum system with @xmath18 quantum levels is established when the quantum fluctuation @xmath19 is much smaller than the average quantum number @xmath18 , i.e. @xmath20",
    ". this condition does not depend on @xmath9 , but is controlled by the number of participating particles or quanta .",
    "* _ large @xmath21 as a mean field _ : the limiting theory when @xmath22 in a leading order large n expansion is usually referred to as a _",
    "mean field theory _ in that contributions from fluctuations are maximally suppressed . to see this note that in every theory known to have a sensible large @xmath21 limit , the vacuum expectation of any product of operators , @xmath23 , satisfies the factorization relation @xmath24 ( this means that the disconnected feynman graphs always dominate ) .",
    "therefore the variance of any operator vanishes as @xmath25 , @xmath26 this means that the fluctuations become negligible when @xmath22 . * _ @xmath1 and @xmath22 are different limits . _",
    "the loop expansion and large n expansion are very different . in qcd",
    ", @xmath21 determines the number of degrees of freedom ( @xmath27 gluons ) , therefore the limit @xmath28 resembles the infinite volume limit of a two - dimensional lattice system .",
    "this is different for theories involving @xmath21-component vector fields such as the @xmath0 model described in section  [ sec : onlargen ] .",
    "there , the @xmath1 limit gives the complete classical theory whereas @xmath22 is the gaussian approximation of a quantum theory , for which classical and quantum dynamics are identical .",
    "so even for this class of theories these two limits are , strictly speaking , different .",
    "* _ is the mean field a classical field ? _ there is a common misunderstanding which equates mean field with classical field , whence @xmath22 limit is viewed as a condition of classicality .",
    "but as pointed out by habib @xcite(and reference therein ) it is only for gaussian systems such as the o(n ) qm model that this is true .",
    "it is not true , e.g. , for gauge fields , as shown below . *",
    "_ large @xmath21 as thermodynamic limit ?",
    "_ coleman in his 1979 erice lectures @xcite , perhaps the most commonly read introduction to large n field theory , drew a parallel with the classical limit :  there is a classical gauge field configuration , which i will call the master field , such that the large - n limits of all gauge invariant green functions are given by their values at the master field . \" along this line witten in his 1979 cargese lectures @xcite presented an argument for the existence of a master field in the large-@xmath21 limit of qcd .",
    "however , o. haan @xcite pointed out that a crucial assumption witten made , that the expectation value of any @xmath29 symmetric operator of the form @xmath30 $ ] where @xmath31 are @xmath32 matrix fields , factorizes , i.e. , @xmath33 $ ] , does not hold .",
    "he showed that for the two matrix models this ` masterfield ' does not exist . instead of the classical limit",
    "haan argued that the factorization of expectation values of invariant operators is a property analogous to the vanishing of fluctuations for macroscopic observables in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we will return to this issue in section 5.3 . * _ hydrodynamics and thermodynamics limits .",
    "_ see section  [ subsec : dechyd ] on this issue .",
    "* yaffe in @xcite stated that to view large @xmath21 limits as classical mechanics requires 4 assumptions .",
    "if these assumptions are satisfied , one can generate a natural set of generalized coherent states .",
    "these coherent states may then be used to construct a classical phase space , derive a classical hamiltonian , and the resulting classical dynamics is equivalent to the limiting form of the original quantum dynamics .",
    "+ we note that by way of a microscopic model in the open quantum system framework zurek , habib and paz @xcite studied environment - induced decoherence and showed that there is a tendency for a quantum system to evolve to a coherent state which is commonly viewed as the ` most classical ' quantum state .",

    "the average number of positively charged particles ( or negatively charged antiparticles ) in this basis is given by @xmath222 thus the diagonal and off - diagonal elements of the density matrix in the adiabatic particle number basis stand in precisely the same relationship to each other and contain the same information as the particle number @xmath209 and pair correlation @xmath208 respectively .",
    "from the ( admittedly somewhat simplistic ) perspective of the diagonization of the ( reduced ) density matrix as a signifier of classicality , this is similar to the criterion used in environment - induced decoherence alluded to in section 4.1 , with one major difference : here , quantum phase in the system is eliminated by choice of representation , while there , it is through the system s interaction with the environment .",

    "results obtained from neglecting quantum phase are known to be quite accurate for long intervals of time in the back - reaction of the current on the electric field producing the pairs , because when the current is summed over all the @xmath213 modes , the phase information in the pair correlations cancels very efficiently .",

    "a central theme of this program is the decoherence of hydrodynamic variables , namely , that the variables typically characterizing the quasiclassical domain of a large and possibly complex quantum system that will become classical ` habitually ' are the integrals over small volumes of locally conserved densities .",
    "examples of local densities are number density , momentum density , energy density , charge density , which are collectively called hydrodynamic variables .",

    "b ) when the initial state is a local equilibrium state , large - n statistics guarantees that the probabilities for histories of local densities are strongly peaked about a single history which describes the evolution of the mean in the local equilibrium initial state .",
    "this intuitively clear result readily connects with previous work , which shows that the mean values of local densities evolve according to hydrodynamic equations .",
    "the fact that there is essentially only one history with nonzero probability means that there is approximate decoherence .",
    "\\3 ) brun and halliwell @xcite considered a class of models consisting of a large number of weakly interacting components , in which the projections onto local densities may be decomposed into projections onto one of two alternatives of the individual components .",
    "one model they gave is the placement of n particles into two partitions , the other model consists of a long chain of locally coupled spins for which the hamiltonian conserves the total spin .",
    "they computed the decoherence functional for histories of local densities , in the limit when the number of components is very large , they find that decoherence requires two conditions : a ) the smearing volumes must be sufficiently large to ensure approximate conservation , and b ) the local densities must be partitioned into sufficiently large ranges to ensure protection against quantum fluctuations .",

    "one may hope to come up with a systematic way to identify the demarkation zone between classical and quantum features in terms of n for a quantum system with a large collection of components .",
    "but as we forewarned in the introduction , this equivalence of mean field with classical features is valid only for gaussian theories .",
    "more accurately one should think about mean field rather than classical theory in the leading order large n and deviations from the mean in the nlo large n. one should therefore ask , 3 ) does one see a change of qualitative behaviour in the nlo or higher order large n expansion from the mean field theory ?",

    "perhaps one should not think of quantum fluctuations , but correlations , as in the bbgky hierarchy ? ( the role of 2piea in closed ( democratic ) systems such as systems with n components will be discussed in our next paper . ) finally , to see the difference of behaviour from the o(n ) model we have studied above one should also ask , 4 ) would the large n limit of a gauge field theory behave differently , and how so ?",

    "the convexity of the effective potential is a consequence ( or a guarantee , depending on which way one looks at it ) of the positivity .",
    "this is the reason why the critical values @xmath232 and @xmath230 are about the same .",
    "recall that @xmath232 is the critical value of @xmath21 below which an instability occurs ( see figure 7 in macdh for a plot of @xmath248 as a function of @xmath182 ) at finite time and @xmath230 is the critical value of @xmath21 below which the effective potential ceases to exist everywhere .",

    "is restored .",
    "the effective potential is convex for both classical and quantum o(n ) models if we do nt make any approximation .",
    "hence the fact that convexity is restored for @xmath231 is a statement about the validity of the @xmath62 approximation , not about the system becoming classical or if enough quantum details have been retained .",
    "as macdh mention in their paper although nlo is a significant improvement over lo for sufficiently large n , at late times nlo fails to capture the nonlinear effects as well as lo does . hence having @xmath231 ( or @xmath234 , since they are both of the same order ) does nt mean nlo approximation describes the dynamics accurately , it simply means the divergences and nonpositivity is avoided . at late enough times",
    "the approximation will fail ( see figure 11 in macdh ) .",
    "in general to make a claim about the validity of an approximation time need be specified , since any approximation will fail after some time . to inquire about the turnover from quantum dynamics to classical dynamics we are referring to the full dynamics , not just for short time transient or long time asymptote behaviours .",
    "thus , we see that @xmath231 is a criterion for the validity of the nlo approximation , as these authors meant it to be , not so much about the quantum versus classical behaviour of the n component system . as a side note",

    "<S> the theories we consider here are , the @xmath0 quantum mechanical model , semiclassical stochastic gravity and gauge / string theories ; the contexts include that of a ` quantum roll ' in inflationary cosmology , entropy generation in quantum vlasov equation for plasmas , the leading order and next - to - leading order large n behaviour , and hydrodynamic / thermodynamic limits . </S>",
    "<S> the criteria for classicality in our consideration include the use of uncertainty relations , the correlation between classical canonical variables , randomization of quantum phase , environment - induced decoherence , decoherent history of hydrodynamic variables , etc . all this exercise is to ask only one simple question : is it really so surprising that quantum features can appear in macroscopic objects ? by examining different representative systems where detailed theoretical analysis has been carried out , we find that there is no a priori good reason why quantum phenomena in macroscopic objects can not exist .    </S>",
