    "during the past decade improved experimental techniques have made production of and measurements on one - dimensional systems possible @xcite , and hence led to an increasing theoretical interest in these systems . since its formulation in 1992 @xcite the density matrix renormalization group method ( dmrg )",
    "has been established as a very powerful , quasi - exact method for numerical calculations of properties of ( quasi ) one - dimensional systems .    in this paper",
    "we present a new approach for calculating linear response conductance for one - dimensional interacting nanostructures coupled to non - interacting tight binding leads .",
    "the method combines kubo expressions for the conductance with numerical dmrg calculations and is valid for arbitrary interaction strength .",
    "it facilitates a unified description of strong and weak interactions and provides conductance directly form a transport calculation , without relying on relations between equilibrium and transport properties .",
    "we employ current - density and current - current correlation functions to calculate the conductance and in the non - interacting case compare to exact diagonalization calculations .    in the strongly interacting limit",
    "a simple interpretation of the position of the resonances is given in terms of freely moving hard - core particles on a reduced size lattice @xcite , and quantitative comparison with numerical dmrg results shows good agreement .",
    "we are interested in studying the effect of correlations on transport within a microscopic model of an interacting one - dimensional nanostructure coupled to two non - interacting tight binding leads , as shown in fig .",
    "[ model_figure ] .",
    "electrons are treated as spinless and only nearest neighbor interaction is considered .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is @xmath0 the parameter @xmath1 controls the smoothing of the interaction on the dot over the contact links as discussed in @xcite , and @xmath2 is a gate voltage on the structure . in this work we set @xmath3 .",
    "using linear response in applied source - drain voltage , @xmath4 , the current is given by @xmath5    \\big|\\psi_0\\big>,\\\\    \\tilde{j}_{n}(t ) & = & -it_{n } \\big [ \\tilde{c}_{n}^\\dagger(t ) \\tilde{c}_{{n}-1}^{\\phantom\\dagger}(t)-\\tilde{c}_{{n}-1}^\\dagger(t )    \\tilde{c}_{n}^{\\phantom\\dagger}(t)\\big],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "[ equilibrium hamiltonian ] , the applied voltage perturbation is @xmath7 , @xmath8 denotes the interaction picture time evolution of the operator @xmath9 , and @xmath10 denotes the ground state .",
    "note that in this approach @xmath11 contains all correlations of the unbiased structure , since we apply it to the quasi - exact ground state given by the dmrg procedure .",
    "the number operator is taken as a symmetric combination of the left and right lead operators , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the equilibrium current included for completeness and henceforth neglected in all numerical calculations .",
    "the kubo conductance in the dc limit , @xmath14 , can be expressed in terms of two different correlators , @xmath15 ^ 2}\\hat {    j}_{n_2}\\big|\\psi_0\\big>,\\label{g_jj definition}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the positions @xmath16 and @xmath17 are defined in fig .",
    "[ model_figure ] .",
    "analogous kubo expressions were used by louis and gros in @xcite , where quantum monte carlo calculations for the density - density correlator were performed .",
    "to improve the finite size scaling and to facilitate the use of sufficiently short leads we use exponentially damped boundary conditions , decreasing the hopping elements towards the end of the leads exponentially as shown for the right lead in eq .",
    "[ damped boundary conditions ] , @xmath18 & \\rightarrow &      [ -t , \\cdots , -t,\\underbrace{-td ,- td^{2},\\cdots ,- td^{m_d-1 } ,      -td^{m_d}}_{m_d}]\\,,\\label{damped boundary conditions}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 .",
    "the improvement of the finite size scaling relies on two properties of the dbc s : ( 1 ) they allow for use of a smaller @xmath20 and ( 2 ) serve as a particle bath for the nanostructure . the first property is caused by the introduction of exponentially small energyscales in the system thus reducing the finite size level splitting at the fermi energy at half filling .",
    "the second property can be understood from the fact that the energy cost of adding or removing a particle from the damped region is of the order of the exponentially small hopping element .    the dbc s introduce two more parameters in the model , the number of damped bonds @xmath21 and the damping factor @xmath22 , and these must take values such that physical quantities do not depend sensitively on the particular choice .",
    "before actual numerical calculations can be performed the parameters of the model , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath20 , must be determined .",
    "this is done using exact diagonalization calculations for the non - interacting systems , specifically the resonant value at @xmath23 . for half",
    "filled leads .",
    "due to the bath property of the dbc s it is safe to assume that half filling is maintained in the parts of the leads that are close to the nanostructure .",
    "in contrast the strongly damped regions act like particle baths and therefore can not maintain half filling for non - zero external potential . ] for fixed @xmath21 we do indeed find a range of @xmath22 values that produce essentially identical physical results , indicating the range of validity of the dbc s .",
    "additionally we find that the actual value of @xmath21 is not significant ( for reasonably large values ) as long as the corresponding value of @xmath22 is tuned such that the damping at the edge reaches values of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the leads used are sufficiently long to keep the damped region separated from the nanostructure , thus allowing friedel oscillations at the structure edge to decay before reaching the damped region .",
    "the magnitude of the parameter @xmath20 is bounded by physical arguments ; from below by the fact that it should be larger than the finite size level splitting to allow transport , and from above by the broadening of physical results by any finite @xmath20 , and should thus be much smaller than the width of the resonances we wish to resolve .",
    "it is important to note , that @xmath20 is an inherent property of any transport calculation and can only be avoided if one finds a way to obtain transport properties from equilibrium properties .    the conductances in eqs .",
    "[ g_jv definition ] and [ g_jj definition ] are given in terms of ground state correlators and hence dmrg is directly applicable .",
    "to evaluate the correlators we use the correction vector dmrg @xcite in the zero frequency limit .",
    "calculating , e.g. , the correlator in eq .",
    "[ g_jj definition ] is done by formulating the linear problems , @xmath24\\big|\\phi_j\\big>,\\label{correction vector    definition}\\ ] ] which can be solved for @xmath25 by a linear solver .",
    "having solved for the correction vector @xmath25 the conductance is found as the vector overlap , @xmath26 in our dmrg calculations we target apart from the ground state also the real and imaginary parts of the two correction vectors , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , as well as the states @xmath29 and @xmath30 to ensure that the dmrg basis is suitable for describing the conductance accurately @xcite .",
    "it should be mentioned that the damped boundary conditions make the convergence rate in numerical calculations much slower .",
    "in addition any finite external gate voltage , @xmath2 , changes the particle number in the structure and the excess particles come from the bath property of the dbc s .",
    "we therefore face the problem that the damping should be sufficiently strong to provide a reasonable particle bath but at the same time a strong damping decreases the coupling of the highly damped region to the rest of the system . to remedy the slow convergence in the dmrg calculations we turn on the damping in steps and perform several finite system dmrg sweeps for each such damping step .",
    "in other words , we perform a complete finite lattice calculation employing typically 11 sweeps and then initiate the scaling sweeps .",
    "this allows dmrg to gradually optimize the basis to include the damping in the leads and provides a more gradual decoupling of the damped regions from the rest of the system , thus improving the convergence rate at the cost of more dmrg iterations .",
    "nevertheless the resolvent equations , eq .",
    "[ correction vector definition ] , are still ill - conditioned and standard solvers like the conjugate gradient method do not converge .",
    "we use instead a preconditioned davidson type solver similar to ramasesha @xcite modified with a gauss - seidel enhanced block diagonal preconditioner .",
    "the dmrg calculations presented in fig .  [ allfigures ] were done using up to @xmath31 states . in our dmrg",
    "implementation we do not fix the number of states per block to be @xmath32 but rather fix the dimension of the target space to be at least @xmath33 . in the calculations presented this corresponds to an increase of block states of typically @xmath34 .",
    "here we present dmrg and ( in the non - interacting limit ) exact diagonalization calculations for a single resonant level , fig .",
    "[ ms=1,v=0.0 ] , and a nanostructure consisting of seven sites coupled symmetrically to two non - interacting leads . for the extended structure we present results in the non interacting limit , fig .",
    "[ ms=7,v=0.0 ] , and for weak and strong interaction , fig .",
    "[ ms=7,v=1.0 ] and [ ms=7,v=5.0 ] .",
    "the spinless single resonant level is generically non - interacting and serves as a testing ground for the approach .",
    "the exact result for the conductance in the symmetrically coupled case can be shown to be a lorentzian of full width @xmath35 at half maximum , where @xmath36 . in fig .",
    "[ ms=1,v=0.0 ] we show exact diagonalization and dmrg calculations for the single resonant level and the two sets are virtually indistinguishable . this verifies that the truncation error introduced by the dmrg is negligible .",
    "furthermore we have plotted the exact lorentzian result , and the agreement between the three curves is very good , demonstrating the accuracy of our combined kubo and dmrg approach .",
    "there is a systematic difference between the current - current and the current - density correlators , specifically close to resonances the current - density correlator generally gives better results .",
    "this is due to the additional energy dependent broadening given by @xmath37 in the current - current correlator .",
    "the opposite is true in the tails where the current - current correlator is more reliable since it is less sensitive to changes of the particle number .",
    "+    in numerical calculations the parameter @xmath20 is always finite making the expected form of the conductance peaks that of an area normalized lorentzian ( @xmath38 ) of half - width @xmath20 convoluted with the `` bare '' physical result . assuming as a first approximation that the latter is a height normalized lorentzian ( @xmath39 ) of width @xmath40 , the expression for the expected numerical results is of the general form @xmath41 to leading order in @xmath20 the conductance at the resonant level",
    "is then given by @xmath42 , which demonstrates that one needs small @xmath20 to reach the unitary limit , @xmath43 .",
    "however @xmath20 is known from the input and @xmath40 can be extracted from the results .",
    "thus a conductance value on resonance of @xmath44 is explained entirely by the broadening by the finite leads and therefore suggests that infinite leads in this case would yield the unitary limit .",
    "our calculations indicate , that the peak width is only slightly affected by the interaction on the nanostructure , as long as the nanostructure remains in the luttinger liquid regime .",
    "however , once the structure is driven into the charge density wave regime the peak width decreases rapidly . a more detailed study of the resonance shapes is considered future work .",
    "the position of the resonances can be described by the addition spectrum , @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the energy of the isolated nanostructure occupied by @xmath47 particles . in the large interaction limit",
    "the kinetic energy of the particles can be approximated by freely moving fermions on an effective lattice of size @xmath48 . in this approximation",
    "one describes the interacting fermions by effective hard - core particles of the size of the interaction range , compare @xcite .",
    ".  [ addition spectrum u_g ] can be expressed as @xmath49 where @xmath47 should be small enough that the nanostructure is still in a delocalized state .    in an effective charging model the additional splitting of the levels due to the interaction",
    "is linear in the charging interaction @xmath50 .",
    "by contrast , in our microscopic model the interaction leads to an overall _ offset _ for the non - central peaks , while their mutual _ splitting _ is governed by the kinetic energy , @xmath51 .    in tab .",
    "[ peak position table ] we show a comparison of resonance positions as predicted by the reduced lattice ( rl ) model in eq .",
    "[ predicted resonance positions ] , as predicted by exact diagonalization ( ed ) of the isolated nanostructure , and resonances found in our dmrg calculations for interaction strengths @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 .",
    "the position of the outermost resonance from @xmath55 particle fits fairly well for both predictions , while the next ones deviate somewhat .",
    "the rl prediction for the transition @xmath56 is not expected to be accurate since @xmath57 is a localized charge density wave like state .",

    "in this work we have presented a new approach for linear conductance calculations of interacting one - dimensional nanostructures , combining linear response for conductance and dmrg .",
    "we have benchmarked this new approach against exact diagonalization calculations in the non - interacting case and found excellent agreement , which serves as a real test for the real space dmrg . for the resonant level we also compared our results to the exact lorentzian result , and found excellent agreement .    for the interacting case we have presented conductance curves for a seven site nanostructure in both the luttinger liquid ( @xmath60 ) and the charge density wave ( @xmath52 ) regimes , thus demonstrating the versatility of our approach .",
