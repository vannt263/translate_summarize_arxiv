    "past measurements of charmed - hadron , @xmath0 , production in high - energy scattering experiments @xcite have shown that inclusive heavy - quark production provides us with an interesting testing ground for the dynamics of the strong interaction . with the advent of high - statistics data from the lhc",
    ", we can expect that upcoming new results will allow us to test the predictions of qcd with much better precision .",
    "the lhc experiments will also extend into the region of higher transverse momenta , where theory is expected to provide more reliable predictions .",
    "this is not only important for testing qcd itself ; but a good understanding of heavy - quark production is also vital for searches of new - physics phenomena .",
    "recent analyses of @xmath1-meson production at the lhc have been published by the alice @xcite and atlas collaborations @xcite .",
    "similar data that are being analyzed by the lhcb collaboration @xcite are expected to appear soon .",
    "the aim of the present article is to present predictions for the inclusive production of charmed hadrons at the lhc within the general - mass variable - flavor - number scheme ( gm - vfns ) .",
    "we extend results which have already been used by the experimental collaborations for comparisons with their data , and we discuss these results under a common perspective . where possible we , therefore , use information from the experiments about the accessible phase space regions . in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "we have considered the inclusive production of @xmath2 mesons , for which experimental results from the cms collaboration are already available @xcite .    theoretical predictions for the production of heavy - flavored mesons at high transverse momentum ( @xmath3 ) are technically difficult to obtain due to the presence of two different scales , @xmath3 and the heavy - quark mass @xmath4 . on the one hand ,",
    "the heavy - quark mass can be considered as the large scale , since @xmath5 , making perturbative qcd applicable .",
    "when @xmath4 is the only large scale , as for example in the calculation of the total cross section or in predictions for @xmath3 distributions at small values of @xmath3 , i.e.  if @xmath3 is of the same order of magnitude as @xmath4 , predictions from a fixed - order calculation are reliable .",
    "on the other hand , if the transverse momentum of the produced heavy quark is large compared with the heavy - quark mass , @xmath6 , then large logarithms @xmath7 have to be resummed .    in the first case , for @xmath8 , the traditional approach",
    "is called fixed - flavor - number scheme ( ffns ) @xcite .",
    "it is based on the assumption that the gluon and the light partons ( @xmath9 ) are the only active partons .",
    "the heavy quark appears only in the final state , produced in the hard - scattering process of light partons .",
    "the heavy - quark mass is explicitly taken into account together with the transverse momentum of the produced heavy meson assuming that @xmath4 and @xmath3 are of the same order .",
    "predictions of the ffns are reliable close to the threshold of heavy - quark production .    in the second case , for @xmath6",
    ", the large logarithmic terms have to be resummed .",
    "the well - known factorization theorem provides the foundation of this resummation by incorporating the large logarithms into parton distribution and fragmentation functions and imposing the dglap evolution equations .",
    "this approach requires that the heavy quark is treated as a parton , and as a consequence , one has to take into account additional processes where heavy quarks occur as incoming partons or by fragmentation from light partons .",
    "the heavy quark is treated as any other massless parton . if @xmath4 is neglected in the calculation of the hard - scattering matrix element , this approach is called zero - mass variable - flavor - number scheme ( zm - vfns ) @xcite .",
    "the predictions in the zm - vfns are expected to be reliable only in the region of very large transverse momenta , since terms of the order of @xmath10 present in the hard - scattering cross sections are neglected .",
    "in fact , it is not necessary to neglect @xmath4 altogether in a variable - flavor - number scheme .",
    "instead , it is possible to absorb the large logarithms @xmath11 into parton distribution and fragmentation functions , where they are resummed by imposing dglap evolution , as in the zm - vfns , while at the same time , @xmath4-dependent terms as obtained in the ffns are retained in the hard - scattering cross sections .",
    "this so - called general - mass variable - flavor - number scheme ( gm - vfns ) thus combines the virtues of the ffns and the zm - vfns .",
    "the required subtraction of logarithmic terms , which are related to initial- and final - state singularities , can be defined using the usual @xmath12 prescription , which guarantees the universality of parton distribution and fragmentation functions and allows for a meaningful comparison of data from different measurements .",
    "this approach has been applied in the calculation of charmed - meson production in @xmath13 collisions in ref .",
    "@xcite and compared to data from the cdf collaboration @xcite at the fermilab tevatron .",
    "the theoretical background and explicit analytic results of the gm - vfns approach have been discussed in detail previously in ref .",
    "@xcite and the references cited therein . here we only describe our choice of input for the present numerical analysis .    throughout",
    "we use as parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) the set cteq6.6 @xcite as implemented in lhapdf @xcite , except where we discuss uncertainties related to the choice of the pdfs . the fragmentation functions ( ffs ) determined in ref .",
    "@xcite are used wherever possible , i.e.  for the production of @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 mesons .",
    "they are based on fits to the presently most precise data on charmed - meson production from the cleo collaboration @xcite at lepp cesr and from the belle collaboration @xcite at the kek collider for @xmath2 physics ( kekb ) .",
    "these ffs always refer to the average over charge - conjugated states , and our results below have to be understood as averaged cross sections @xmath17 . for @xmath18 and @xmath19 production",
    ", we have to resort to the earlier determination of ffs described in ref .",
    "these ffs were determined by fitting the fractional - energy spectra of the @xmath0 hadrons measured by the opal collaboration @xcite in @xmath20 annihilation on the @xmath21-boson resonance at the cern lep1 collider .",
    "these data have rather large experimental errors and the disadvantage of being at the rather large scale of the @xmath21-boson mass , far away from the typical scales of @xmath0 production presently observed at the lhc .",
    "the subtractions related to renormalization as well as to the factorization of initial- and final - state singularities requires the introduction of scale parameters @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "we fix these scales by the transverse mass of the produced charm quark , @xmath25 . in order to exploit the freedom in the choice of scales ,",
    "we introduce scale parameters @xmath26 ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) by setting @xmath30 .",
    "error bands describing the theoretical uncertainties can then be determined by varying the values of @xmath26 independently by factors of two up and down while keeping any ratio of the @xmath26 smaller than or equal to two .",
    "we emphasize that the uncertainties related to scale variations are by far the dominating source of theoretical uncertainties . for pdf - related uncertainties",
    ", we will show explicit results below .",
    "for the influence of variations of the value of the charm - quark mass we refer to our previous work @xcite .",
    "there we have shown that those terms that carry a dependence on @xmath4 , coming from the hard - scattering matrix element , are small .",

    "we expect more data from the other lhc experiments soon , and our results have been presented in a form which should make future comparisons straightforward .    we have found that the production cross sections at large rapidities are sensitive to a nonperturbative component of the charm parton distribution function .",
