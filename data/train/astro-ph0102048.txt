    "the mass of clusters of galaxies is dominated by dark matter .",
    "the evolution of the dark matter halo population is now well - understood both theoretically @xcite and numerically @xcite .",
    "the halos themselves are approximately self - similar and may be described in their inner regions by a one - parameter model @xcite with a concentration parameter that is a slow function of mass .",
    "( note , however , that there are significant deviations from this simple profile in the outer parts of clusters ; see thomas et  al.2001 . )    the intracluster medium ( icm ) does not share the approximate self - similarity of the dark matter .",
    "this is expressed most clearly in the x - ray luminosity - temperature relation .",
    "for pure bremsstrahlung emission , the bolometric x - ray luminosity should scale with temperature as @xmath7 ( the inclusion of line emission flattens this relation ) , whereas observations indicate a much steeper temperature dependence , especially for low - mass systems @xcite . at high temperatures part of this steepening",
    "is due to a central cooling flow , but removing the cooling flow component still does not reconcile the observations with the self - similar prediction @xcite .",
    "the reason for the departure from self - similarity is that the gas is not as centrally - concentrated in clusters as the dark matter , which is best physically expressed as an increase in entropy of the innermost gas @xcite .",
    "the most obvious explanation for this is that there has been some form of energy injection .",
    "the amount of energy required depends upon the density of the gas at the time when the heating occured .",
    "@xcite argue for heating prior to cluster collapse and estimate a value of 0.3kev per particle .",
    "@xcite show that this can be lowered to 0.1kev per particle by heating at the optimal time ( when the gas is at its minimum density ) but most other studies that consider heating within collapsed halos require much higher values of 13kev per particle @xcite .",
    "there are two likely sources for any excess energy : stellar winds / supernovae and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "it is known for cdm models that some feedback of energy into the intergalactic medium must occur in order to prevent the `` cooling catastrophe '' , in which the majority of the baryons in the universe cool and form stars at high redshift @xcite .",
    "if the heating efficiency is high , supernovae can inject an energy of order 0.3kev per particle into the intergalactic medium , but they do not do so in an optimal way .",
    "various authors , all of whom consider realistic , but different , models for the build - up of structure , conclude that supernovae are unable to provide the required excess entropy @xcite .",
    "heating of the intergalactic medium by quasars is also not without its problems as the heating must occur at just the right time in order not to overly suppress galaxy formation .",
    "alternatively , the heating may arise from agn buried within individual galaxies @xcite .",
    "radiative cooling results in the removal of low - entropy gas in the cluster core and thus leads to an overall increase in temperature of the icm @xcite .",
    "the amount of cooling that takes place in a cooling flow after the final assembly of a cluster is insufficient to explain the observations @xcite , but a more realistic model in which cooling occurs at every stage of the collapse hierarchy can give entropy increases equivalent to an excess energy of 12kev per particle @xcite  in essence most of the cooling occurs in galaxy - sized halos before the formation of the cluster .",
    "@xcite has developed a simple model in which low - entropy gas is removed from the cluster core and the surrounding gas is assumed not to have cooled at all .",
    "although this model has obvious deficiencies , it predicts the correct luminosity - temperature relation from 0.510kev .",
    "simulations of cluster formation including radiative energy loss have been carried out by @xcite .",
    "they showed that the gas is slightly heated and that the luminosity is greatly reduced ( except in cooling flow clusters ) , in agreement with expectations .",
    "however , the simulations were of limited resolution and covered only a small range in cluster mass .",
    "we are now undertaking a programme of simulations to extend these results over a wider mass - range and to contrast the properties of clusters in different cosmologies .",
    "in this letter we report results at @xmath2 from two simulations of a 100@xmath1mpc box in the  cosmology , one with and one without radiative cooling .",
    "the simulations and cluster extraction method are described in section  [ sec : method ] and the results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we summarize our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we have carried out two simulations with 160@xmath8 particles each of gas and dark matter within cubical volumes of side 100@xmath1mpc .",
    "the cosmological parameters were as follows : density parameter , @xmath9 ; cosmological constant , @xmath10 ; hubble parameter , @xmath11kms@xmath12mpc@xmath13 ; baryon density parameter , @xmath14 ; power spectrum shape parameter , @xmath15 ; and a linearly - extrapolated root - mean - square dispersion of the density fluctuations on a scale 8@xmath16mpc , @xmath17 . with these parameters ,",
    "the gas and dark matter particle masses are approximately @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "this mass is below the @xcite limit above which numerical heating dominates cooling .",
    "the runs were started at a redshift , @xmath20 and evolved to the present day , @xmath2 .",
    "the gravitational softening was fixed at @xmath21kpc in comoving co - ordinates until @xmath22 and thereafter held constant at 25@xmath23kpc in physical co - ordinates .",
    "this softening is sufficient to prevent two - body relaxation @xcite and we have checked that the gas and dark - matter have similar specific energy profiles in clusters drawn from the non - radiative simulation .",
    "the only difference in the two runs was that one of them included radiative cooling . for this run",
    ", we used the cooling tables of @xcite and assumed a uniform but time - varying metallicity of @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the age of the universe in units of the current time .",
    "this time - varying metallicity is meant to crudely mimic the gradual enrichment of the icm by stars , but more importantly it results in a global cooled gas fraction at the end of the simulation of approximately 20 per cent .",
    "this is the maximum value inferred from the observations of clusters @xcite which means that our simulation will represent the largest effect that cooling alone is likely to have on the intracluster medium .",
    "we use a parallel version of the hydra @xmath26-body / sph code as described by @xcite and @xcite except that the sph equations have been modified to use the pairwise artificial viscosity of @xcite  for a test of different sph formalisms see @xcite .",
    "we decouple the hot and cold gas in the manner described by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also ritchie & thomas 2001 ) to prevent artificial overcooling of hot gas onto the central cluster galaxies .",
    "groups of 13 or more cold , dense gas particles ( with @xmath27 and @xmath2812000k ) are merged together to form collisionless _ galaxy _",
    "particles , which can only grow via the accretion of more gas .",
    "not only does this save considerable computational effort , it also prevents small objects from being artifically disrupted within cluster potentials .",
    "initially we identify clusters in our simulation by searching for groups of dark matter particles within an isodensity contour of 200 , as described in @xcite .",
    "we work with a preliminary catalogue of all objects with more than 250 particles , then retain only those which have a total mass within the virial radius exceeding @xmath29 , corresponding to 500 particles of each species .",
    "the use of a small mass for the preliminary cluster selection ensures that our catalogue is complete .",
    "we have checked that using a different isodensity threshold , a different selection algorithm , or using gas particles instead of dark - matter particles to define the cluster , leads to an almost identical cluster catalogue  the only difference being the merger or otherwise of a small number of binary clusters .",
    "we define the centre of the cluster to be the position of the densest dark matter particle . because the density parameter of the real universe is not known",
    ", we choose to average properties of the clusters within spheres that enclose an overdensity of 200 relative to the critical density ( whereas for this cosmology the virial radius corresponds to an overdensity relative to critical of about 110 ) .",
    "our final catalogues consist of 427 and 428 clusters in the radiative and non - radiative simulations , respectively .",
    "we calculate the bolometric luminosity of each cluster using @xmath30 where the subscript @xmath31 denotes the sum over all gas particles within radius @xmath32 that have temperatures , @xmath33 , masses @xmath34 and densities , @xmath35 ; we assume a mean molecular mass @xmath36 g and an emissivity , @xmath37 , that is the same function used by hydra to calculate cooling rates , as discussed in section  [ sec : simulations ] .",
    "note that , for temperatures below about @xmath38k , line emission is important and the cooling rates are substantially higher than the contribution from bremsstrahlung alone .",
    "the emission - weighted temperature of each cluster is calculated as @xmath39    many of the smaller clusters in our catalogues have emission - weighted temperatures that are below 0.5kev which means that the majority of their emission will emerge at energies that are below the x - ray bands .",
    "we do not attempt to calculate the emission in any particular x - ray passband in this paper but instead quote bolometric luminosities and emission - weighted temperatures .",
    "= 6.5 cm    we plot the emission - weighted temperature - mass relation for both cluster samples in fig .",
    "[ fig : tm200 ] . results from the simulations with and without cooling are illustrated using crosses and filled circles , respectively .",
    "the broken lines are power - law fits to the observational relation as determined by @xcite , using mass estimates from galaxy velocity dispersions ( dashed ) , x - ray temperature profiles ( dash - dotted ) , the isothermal @xmath40-model ( dotted ) and the surface brightness deprojection method ( dash - triple dotted ) .    for the simulation with radiative cooling the relationship between @xmath41 and @xmath42 is an approximate power law @xmath43 and for the simulation without radiative cooling @xmath44 these should be compared with the virial relation ( shown as the solid line on the figure ) @xmath45 ( note that no attempt has been made when making these fits to reproduce the observational selection effects .",
    "they should therefore be regarded as rough guides rather than precise predictions . )",
    "the clusters from the non - cooling run mostly have emission - weighted temperatures that are much lower than the virial values .",
    "the reason for this is that their emission is dominated by high - density , low - temperature gas in the core of the cluster ( this temperature drop in the core is simply due to the fact that the specific energy profile of the gas mimics that of the dynamically - dominant dark matter ) .",
    "small fluctuations in the core properties of the clusters ( which are not well - resolved by our simulations ) lead to a large scatter in predicted temperatures .",
    "it is important to note that these non - radiative simulations do not provide sensible predictions for the observed properties of real clusters  the core gas has a short cooling time and would not in reality persist in the intracluster medium for the lifetime of the cluster .",
    "we note that our non - radiative @xmath4 relation has a lower normalization than found by @xcite for simulations in the @xmath46cdm cosmology because there it was assumed that the emission is purely bremsstrahlung , which underestimates cooling rates below @xmath38k and places less weight on the innermost region of clusters .",
    "in contrast to the non - radiative run , the clusters from the radiative simulation have emission - weighted temperatures that show less scatter and that exceed the virial values .",
    "the reason for this is that the core gas has cooled to low temperatures and been removed from the intracluster medium , leaving behind higher - entropy , higher - temperature gas  an effect that is more pronounced in lower - mass clusters .",
    "the emission is no longer dominated by the core and is well - resolved by our simulations .",
    "the clusters provide an adequate fit to the observational data given the large uncertainty in the latter as evidenced by the various broken lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : tm200 ] .      = 6.5 cm    fig .",
    "[ fig : lt200 ] illustrates x - ray luminosity - temperature relations for both simulations , again using crosses and filled circles for radiative and non - radiative clusters respectively .",
    "we have trimmed the original catalogues by selecting clusters only with temperatures above 0.35 and 0.75kev for the non - radiative and radiative cooling catalogues respectively , to assure completeness in temperature .",
    "the broken lines illustrate best - fit power - law relations as determined by @xcite for their collected group sample ( dashed line ) , cluster sample ( dot - dashed line ) and combined sample ( dotted line ) .",
    "( note that the units for the normalisation of the relations in table  2 of xue & wu 2000 are misquoted and should be a factor of 10 larger , in agreement with their table  1 and figure  1 . )",
    "a power - law fit to results from the radiative simulation gives @xmath47 and for the non - radiative simulation @xmath48    ( as stated in section [ sec : mt ] , these fits should not be taken as precise calibrations . ) again , both the slope and normalization differ between the two simulations .",
    "the non - radiative simulation gives a slope close to 2 , as predicted by self - similar scaling relations ( the relation is slightly flatter due to the inclusion of line emission ) .",
    "however , the radiative simulation gives a significantly steeper slope of @xmath49 .",
    "the normalization of the relation is around a factor of 10100 lower in the radiative simulation than in the non - radiative simulation .",
    "qualitatively , these differences are the same as were found by @xcite , for a smaller cluster sample . the high entropy gas that replaces cooled material in the radiative simulation is hotter and less dense than the gas in the non - radiative simulation .",
    "the change in density has the greater effect , since the x - ray emissivity is a slow function of temperature but is proportional to the square of the gas density .",
    "the combination of the increase in temperature and the decrease in luminosity of the clusters causes the substantial shift in the @xmath6 relation .",
    "the results from the radiative simulation are in good agreement with the best - fit relations of @xcite .",
    "if anything , we predict luminosities that are are a factor of 23 too low , although there is still significant uncertainty in the observational determinations .",
    "in this letter , we have presented results from an ongoing programme to measure the evolution of x - ray cluster properties for a range of physical and cosmological models .",
    "specifically , we have presented the current - day ( @xmath2 ) emission - weighted temperature - mass ( @xmath50 ) and bolometric luminosity - temperature ( @xmath51 ) relations from two simulations of a @xmath0cdm cosmology , one with and one without radiative cooling .",
    "the @xmath4 relation is significantly different in non - radiative and radiative simulations , with the latter in reasonable agreement with observational determinations . in the non - cooling simulation ,",
    "the emission is dominated by cold , dense gas in the cores of the clusters ; radiative cooling removes this gas from the intracluster medium ( converting it into stars ) and replaces it with higher - entropy , hotter material .",
    "this effect is more prevalent in lower - mass systems and so flattens the temperature - mass relation .",
    "the @xmath6 relation is also significantly different between the two simulations .",
    "the high entropy material in the radiative simulation is less dense than the material it replaces and causes the x - ray luminosity of clusters to decrease by around a factor of 100 at @xmath52kev .",
    "the slope of the relation in the non - radiative simulation is 1.9 , similar to self - similar predictions .",
    "however , the slope of the radiative relation is significantly steeper , 3.3 , again due to the differential effect of cooling with halo temperature .",
    "the radiative simulation is in much closer agreement with the observations , both in the slope and normalization of the relation .    in this paper",
    ", we have used bolometric luminosities and emission - weighted temperatures . for",
    "the low - temperature clusters found in the non - radiative simulations , these will differ significantly from properties measured in any particular x - ray band .",
    "however , we wish to emphasize that to attempt to correct for this is misleading as the use of such simulations is wrong in principle  the low - entropy gas in the cores of these clusters has a short cooling time and will not be present in real systems .",
    "the global fraction of cooled gas ( and stars ) in the radiative simulation , 20 per cent , is higher than suggested by observations of the @xmath53-band galaxy luminosity function @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the fraction of cooled gas within the clusters varies between about one - third and two - thirds with decreasing mass . while these values are not convincingly ruled out by observations",
    ", most people would also regard these as high values  in which case our simulation can be treated as an upper bound on the effect of radiative cooling .    in this paper",
    ", we have deliberately ignored the effect of non - gravitational heating upon the gas . in reality , we know that there must be heating associated with star - formation and metal - enrichment of the intracluster medium .",
    "this will raise the entropy of the gas and reduce the amount of cooling that is required to match the observations .",
    "however , we do not regard the case for significant heating by agn or very efficient supernovae feedback as proven .",
    "the simulations described in this paper were carried out on the cray - t3e at the edinburgh parallel computing centre as part of the virgo consortium investigations of cosmological structure formation .",
