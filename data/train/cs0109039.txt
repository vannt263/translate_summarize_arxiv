    "in aoyama and constable ( 1999 ) and constable and aoyama ( 1999 ) we have developed a technique , the @xmath0 distribution , for detecting a mathematical distinction between prose and isometrically lineated text ( verse ) in english . for prose the @xmath0 distribution is flat , for isometrically lineated verse it is peaked at the value of @xmath1 which equals the number of syllables in the normative line . our major focus in that work was on the theoretical value of such a distinction , while in this paper we will turn to look more closely at a point raised before only in passing ( see constable and aoyama ( 1999:515 ) ) , namely the possibility that the features we have identified might be employed as a ` test ' or diagnostic for lineation , enabling an analyst to detect the presence of mathematically lineated text where it is not visually represented on the page ( syllabic verse printed as prose for example ) or is concealed by the layout on the page , as for example when a sonnet is embedded in prose .",
    "we cautioned against the belief that our procedure would enable the detection of small passages of verse embedded in prose on the grounds that the effects of such lineation on the @xmath0 distribution would be so small that any peaks resulting would be swamped by random fluctuations in the rest of the distribution .",
    "however , we suggested that for longer texts the case might be different , and our aim here is to examine two works , t. s. eliot s poem _ four quartets _",
    "( 1936 - 1943 ) and jim crace s novel _ quarantine _ ( 1997 ) with a view to assessing the reliability of the procedure , and developing statistical techniques for determining the strength of inferences based on the computation of @xmath0 distributions .    in concluding we offer further comments on the experimental goals of these two texts , the roots of lineation as a metrical form , and the prose - verse continuum .",
    "the essential feature of the syllabic structure of english prose found by aoyama and constable ( 1999 ) is _ random segmentation _ ; by which we mean that the probability of having a word boundary after any syllable is constant .",
    "mathematically , this implies that the probability of the syllable length of the @xmath2-th word , @xmath3 , being equal to @xmath4 is given by a geometric distribution ; @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the probability of the occurrence of a word boundary after any syllable , this latter probability being a parameter which varies between data sets . the reader might note that the right hand side of the probability ( [ eqn : geom ] ) is independent from @xmath2 , that is",
    ", the probability distribution does not depend on where the word is located in the whole article .",
    "this property of random segmentation leads to the finding that the expectation value of the number of syllables of the @xmath2-th word is independent from @xmath2 ; @xmath7 where the mean syllable length @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 , and the following results for the expectation value of the products of the syllable lengths of the @xmath2-th word and the @xmath10-th word : @xmath11 where the variance @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 .",
    "the finding noted above was made mainly through studies of the @xmath0 distribution , supplemented with studies of the correlations between word lengths . in constable and aoyama ( 1999 ) , we found by examining the @xmath0 distributions that isometrically lineated verse shows systematic deviation from the above properties . in investigating the properties of _ quarantine _ and _ four quartets _ , we find it useful to utilize two other standard statistical tools , fourier analysis and correlation functions , in addition to the @xmath0 distribution . in the following , we will define these three quantities to prepare for the analysis .      the fourier component @xmath14 is defined by the following equation : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the total number of words in the data set .",
    "the fourier component can be directly calculated by the following inversion formula ; @xmath17 these fourier components satisfy the following relations : @xmath18    if the data set is randomly segmented , the expectation values for the fourier coefficients @xmath14 satisfy the following equation : @xmath19 which can be proved by using eqs.([eqn : whitenoise1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : whitenoise2 ] ) .",
    "the fourier analysis is sensitive to any periodic structure in the data ; if there is a periodicity with a period of @xmath20 in the sequence @xmath21 , the coefficient @xmath22 ( or its absolute value ) will be large compared to the other fourier coefficients .",
    "the degree of predominance depends on the strength of the periodicity : if the periodicity is weak the predominance of @xmath23 will be weak .",
    "we will now turn to a consideration of the correlation function : @xmath24 where the subscript of @xmath4 is defined by modulus @xmath16 , i.e. , @xmath25 , and so on .",
    "since the value of @xmath16 is typically of the order @xmath26 , this does not greatly affect the value of @xmath27 . from eq.([eqn",
    ": whitenoise2 ] ) , it is evident that the randomly segmented data leads to the following : @xmath28      the probability @xmath0 is defined as the probability that a sequence of adjacent words has the total number of syllables @xmath1 . to be precise ,",
    "let us define @xmath29 to be the number of occurrences that @xmath2 sequential words have @xmath1 syllables in total",
    ". from this definition , it is evident that the following identity is satisfied : @xmath30 this is because since there are @xmath16 words in the data , there are @xmath16 sequences .",
    "the @xmath0 distribution is defined by the following : @xmath31 the upper limit of the sum in the above is induced by the property that @xmath32 for @xmath33 , which follows from the fact that any english word is at least one - syllable long .",
    "an alternative , but equivalent , definition of @xmath0 is that it is the probability that a word boundary occurs @xmath1-syllables after a word boundary . in this sense , @xmath0 may be called the word - boundary correlation function .",
    "for _ quarantine _ for @xmath34 to @xmath35.,width=226 ]    the plot of the fourier coefficients @xmath14 for _ quarantine _ ( with @xmath36 words ) is given in fig.[fig : qfourier ] .",
    "due to the identity ( [ eqn : symm ] ) , the real part of @xmath14 is symmetric around the middle - point @xmath37 , while the imaginary part of @xmath14 is anti - symmetric around the middle - point .    ) and the behaviours of the actual fourier coefficients of _",
    "quarantine_.,width=415 ]    it is apparent that the real part of @xmath14 has a significant peak denoted by the letter @xmath38 at the middle - point @xmath37 , where @xmath39 . no other structure is visible and the rest of the fourier coeficients are consistent with the white noise characteristics ( [ eqn : whitenoise1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : whitenoise2 ] ) .",
    "in fact , the average number of syllables in this section is @xmath40 , which leads to @xmath41 .",
    "this humber is consistent with the plotted result , as is apparent in fig.[fig : qfgauss ] .",
    "if the random segmentation is valid , the central limiting theorem dictates that the distribution of the fourier coefficients @xmath14 for @xmath42 should follow the gaussian distribution , @xmath43,\\ ] ] where @xmath44 . in fig.[fig : qfgauss ] , the solid curve is the accumulated distribution , @xmath45 with the above value of @xmath12 .",
    "the dots are plots of the positive @xmath46 versus its rank ( the largest being 1 , next 2 , and so on ) devided by the total number of the positive @xmath46 .",
    "the open circles are similar plots for the negative @xmath46 . within statistical accuracy",
    "the dots and open circles should follow the solid curve if the gaussian distribution applies . in fig.[fig : qfgauss ] we see that almost all the points are close to the solid curve , except for the isolated point @xmath38 at the far right , which is the peak @xmath38 at @xmath37 in fig.[fig : qfourier ] .",
    "the fact that this point @xmath38 is far above the theoretical curve suggests that it is very unlikely that this value of @xmath38 is achieved simply by a statistical accident .",
    "this can be explained as follows . at this point ,",
    "@xmath47 , we find that the accumulated probability distribution is @xmath48 , which means that the probability that a point exists beyond this value of @xmath8 is @xmath49 .",
    "on the other hand , there are 19,861 negative @xmath46 and the point @xmath38 exist at this @xmath8 .",
    "so the  measured probability \" is @xmath50 , which is the vertical coordinate of this point .",
    "therefore , the existence of this point @xmath38 simply by accident is quite unlikely ( by the probability @xmath51 ) . putting this in another way",
    ", we may argue as follows : since we have @xmath52 number of points , the expected number of points beyond this value of @xmath8 is equal to @xmath53 .",
    "this should be contrasted with the existence of a single point @xmath38 , which leads to a conclusion that the existence of @xmath38 by chance is almost impossible .",
    "this argument establishes that the peak @xmath38 in fig.[fig : qfourier ] is not an accident of statistical fluctuation , but is a real effect .",
    "the existence of the peak @xmath38 shows that there is a strong period of 2 in _",
    "quarantine_. this is readily seen from the fact that the contribution of the @xmath37 term in the expression of the fourier series ( [ fouriercom ] ) is @xmath54 . since @xmath55 is negative , we find that throughout _ quarantine _ , words in even positions ( 2nd , 4th , 6th , @xmath56 words ) tend to be shorter than those in odd positions .",
    "that is to say , there is a tendency for shorter and longer words to alternate in crace s text .",
    "the relationship between this fact and the rhythmical patterning and consequent lineation noted below may be easily guessed at , but has yet to be examined in any scrupulous way .",
    "the result is plotted in fig.[fig : qcorr ] , where it will be seen that there is no apparent structure and the result is consistent with the prediction ( [ deltakk ] ) from the random segmentation hypothesis .",
    "the only deviation from ( [ deltakk ] ) is the slight deviation at @xmath57 .",
    "we find that this is qualitatively consistent with the analysis done for the @xmath58 dip in english prose by aoyama and constable ( 1999 ) .     for _ quarantine_.,width=415 ]       distribution for _ quarantine_.,width=415 ]",
    "fig.[fig : qqn ] shows the @xmath0 distribution for _ quarantine_. the peaks at @xmath59 , 6 , 8 , 10 , and so on , are sufficiently evident .",
    "it should also be noted that the value for @xmath60 is not , as might be thought , inconsistent with these results .",
    "in fact a dip at @xmath60 is normal in english prose ( see aoyama and constable 1999 ) , and that found in _",
    "quarantine _ proves to be rather smaller than would otherwise be expected .",
    "in other words what appears to be a puzzling dip at @xmath60 , where one might naively expect a peak relating to those at multiples of two , is in fact a smaller than usual depression .",
    "the underlying causes of this reduced depression appear to be an enhancement of disyllables , as can be seen by comparing the word length distribution of crace s text with both an ideal geometric distribution and the data from a large sample of english prose ( see fig.[fig : pq ] ) .",
    "crace uses slightly more disyllables than would be predicted from the geometric distribution , whereas the prose corpus texts employ slightly less .",
    "we have found that the fourier coefficients @xmath14 for any of the four sections have no significant structure , unlike _",
    "quarantine_. they are all consistent with the white noise characteristics ( [ eqn : whitenoise1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : whitenoise2 ] ) .",
    "the result is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fcorr ] , where it will be seen that there is no apparent structure .     for each of the sections.,width=415 ]",
    "plot of the four sections.,width=415 ]      fig.[fig : fqn ] shows these @xmath0 distributions for each of all four sections of _ the four quartets_. as is apparent in this plot , _ burnt norton _",
    "alone has a marked peak , at @xmath59 , a fact which suggests that a substantial part of it is composed in units of four syllables .",
    "of course due to the randomness of the original syllable distribution , one might observe a similar peak by chance .",
    "some care is required in determining whether this @xmath61 peak is the result of authorial compositional ordering , or a simple accident .",
    "we can determine the statistical significance of the peak @xmath61 by calculating the average ( @xmath62 ) and the standard deviation ( @xmath63 ) of @xmath0 from @xmath64 to 200 .",
    "for the _ burnt norton _",
    "section we find the following values : @xmath65 where @xmath66 .",

    "( dashed line ) and the distribution of the measured @xmath0 @xmath69 for the _ burnt norton _ section .",
    "the agreement with the gaussian distribution is evident , except for @xmath61.,width=415 ]    another way to guage the significance of the @xmath61 peak is to make a plot similar to fig.[fig : qfgauss ] .",
    "the probability of such a large deviation from the mean value @xmath70 is given by the accumulated probability @xmath71 , which is defined as the probability that a value larger than or equal to @xmath72 is observed ; @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the gaussian distribution ; @xmath75.\\ ] ] for @xmath76 , we find that @xmath77 .",
    "straightforwardly , the probability of observing as large a peak as that for @xmath61 simply by accident is about @xmath78 .",
    "this situation is shown graphically in fig.[fig : gauss ] , which is similar to fig.[fig : qfgauss ] . in this figure , the accumulated probability density @xmath71 defined in eq.([eqn : gauss ] ) is shown by the dashed line and the actual distribution of @xmath0 in this section by dots .",
    "the agreement between the continuous gaussian distribution with the actual measured value is excellent , _ except for @xmath61_. this both justifies the use of the gaussian distribution above , and visualizes the abnormality of the @xmath61 peak .",
    "this result is consistent with the lack of any structure in the fourier coefficients @xmath79 , since the latter are only sensitive to periodic structures involving the syllable numbers @xmath21 , and would be ideal for studying such structures .",
    "that is to say , if the four syllable units appear in combination and in a periodic manner , the fourier coefficients would make their existence evident .",
    "however , four syllable units , may appear in various combinations , of 1 and 3 syllables , 2 + 2 , 1 + 1 + 2 , and so on ; furthermore , they may appear randomly in the section .",
    "both of these facts would disrupt the periodic structure , and render the fourier analysis useless .",
    "the same is true for the correlation function @xmath27 . on the other hand ,",
    "our word - boundary correlation function @xmath0 is by definition sensitive to the existence of the four syllable units even in this situation .",
    "we have shown that the @xmath0 computation is a sound and fairly sensitive register of one fundamental feature of lineated text , and complementary in some respects to two other statistical methods . in concluding what has been so far a methodological paper we will return to the language materials under consideration and",
    "offer several brief comments on the significance of the @xmath0 peaks detected in the _ four quartets _ and _",
    "quarantine_.      the metrical status of eliot s _ four quartets _ has been much debated , notably in cooper ( 1998 ) .",
    "@xmath0 analysis will not resolve all aspects of this debate , but does contribute significantly in regard to lineation .",
    "our findings are that with the exception of _ burnt norton _",
    "the _ quartets _ are not mathematically lineated . in this",
    "we are in basic agreement with cooper , who carried out an exhaustive rhythmical scansion .",
    "we supplement his remarks by observing that whilst the later three _ quartets _ appear on reading to be to some degree rhythmically regular ( and there are passages which are very obviously composed in isometric lines ) , _ burnt norton _",
    "alone is mathematically lineated overall , the basic mathematical line being a segment of four syllables .",
    "it seems likely that this results from a two beat duple segment , running as follows : offbeat , beat , offbeat , beat .",
    "it should be noted from the @xmath0 distribution that there is no subsequent peak at _",
    "n _ = 8 , suggesting that while these four syllable segments are frequent , they are not so frequently adjacent as to produce an eight syllable mathematical line .",
    "this is surprising , and suggests deliberate avoidance on eliot s part , as if he were unwilling to let his rhythms move too close to the familiar four beat octosyllabic unit .",
    "it seems possible that the poem as it survives traces an experiment with rhythmical patterning , and that eliot s neglect of the 4 syllable line in the subsequent sections is a refinement of method , and the adoption of a revised compositional principle which permitted the production of the desired rhythmical effects without relying on clear echos of regular metrical structures .",
    "_ burnt norton _ is an early attempt to employ rhythmical metre in a form which is looser in its lineation structure than standard verse . as it happens it",
    "is still mathematically lineated .",
    "the subsequent three quartets reveal further and more adventurous developments of this experiment",
    ". it would be interesting to know whether this anticipates in any way the character of the metre employed in eliot s later plays , and we note this as being a topic for future research .",
    "crace s writing , certainly the more recent books , has been very widely regarded as of a type differing from standard prose .",
    "the critic frank kermode has noted of _ quarantine _ that it is from ` the end of the fiction spectrum where the novel is most like a poem , most turned in on itself , most closely wrought for the sake of art and internal cohesion ' ( kermode 1998 ) .",
    "john banville , discussing another of crace s novels , _ being dead _ , has even pointed out that technically the prose often uses verse fragments , and that much of this book is ` written in a kind of broken blank verse , and indeed could be successfully laid out in verse form ' , adding that crace is ` particularly fond of iambic pentameter ' ( banville 2000 ) .    certainly , _",
    "quarantine _ is readily recognized as being rhythmically more regular than ordinary prose , but there are no visually salient lines , and even careful examination during reading fails to find any convincing or consistent division .",
    "although it is possible , as banville says of _ being dead _ , to find occasional lines , even short sequences , it is difficult to successfully display any sizeable piece of the text as isometric verse .",
    "casual examination can make no further progress .",
    "however , the @xmath0 procedure is sufficiently sensitive to detect lineation even when distributed in small and isolated packets , and of _ quarantine _ it reveals that syllabic groups of two , four , six ( which is , curiously , less prominent ) , eight , ten , and subsequent multiples of two are significantly more common than they would be in standard prose .",
    "_ quarantine _ is non - randomly segmented , and even though it does not employ a core isometric line length , and its ` lines ' do not follow on one from another , it is still , and in a novel and important sense , _",
    "lineated_.    the fact that there is no particular preference for one line length over another , that is no preference , say , for decasyllabic groups over octosyllabic groups , is of very great interest , and suggests that crace did not set out to write in lines and then to conceal them by printing his work with a prose layout .",
    "instead we suspect that the lineation detected by the @xmath0 procedure arises as a byproduct of a deliberate organisation of the rhythmical patterning of the text .",
    "the character of this general organisation can be inferred from the @xmath58 data . as noted above ( see section 3.3 ) , although apparently anomalous , because it seems to register a depression rather than a peak , this data point is in fact consistent with the subsequent peaks at multiples of two , since the depression in crace s text is actually smaller than expected .",
    "the fundamental cause of this , as noted in our discussion above , is simply that crace has employed slightly more disyllabic words than would be expected in standard prose , and thus we may conclude that lineation arises in crace s text from a predisposition to employ disyllabic words so as to facilitate the construction of alternating rhythms .    as far as we know",
    "crace has not commented in public on his reasons for employing this structuring .",
    "if asked he would perhaps reply , taking up terms similar to those used by kermode above , that he felt it gave his work a self - supporting and self - consciously artistic structural brace that unpatterned prose did not possess .",
    "while this might be a satisfactory proximal psychological explanation , we suspect that a deeper account of the resulting experiences for both reader and writer is available and may more adequately account for the appeal of this formal device",
    ". anyone who has read crace s work will agree with john updike that it has a ` hallucinatory ' quality ( updike 1999 ) . that this is not readily accounted for by reference to the facts of the narrative",
    "is worth remark , and is a quality which recalls the character of much of the most successful poetry .",
    "the exact consequences of the variety of mathematical lineation found in _",
    "quarantine _ are yet to be fully understood , but it is so far clear that at least some of the previous restrictions noted in regard to isometrically lineated text also apply to crace s composition .",
    "the peaked @xmath0 distribution indicates that some degree of syntactic distortion occurs , and we have seen above that dictional distortion is present in the enhancement of disyllabic words .",
    "it is also possible that even though he was not composing deliberately in a single isometrical line , but varying his segment length , that some reduction in mean word length has taken place , in order to increase the syntactical options ( a known consequence of isometric lineation : see constable and aoyama 1999 ) .",
    "both these distortions have been discussed by constable ( 1998 ) within his disruption theory , which proposes that readers attempting to process text which is evenly and subtly disrupted can neither reject it as damaged nor successfully interpret it , and consequently experience an illusion of profundity ( see also the sketch in constable and aoyama ( 1999 ) ) .",
    "however , it seems almost certain that with the variety of lineation employed in crace s _ quarantine _ these disruptions are less marked .",
    "however , it should be noted that a further source of disruption , that caused by rhythmical patterning , may well be present , namely an alteration in the frequency of stressed and unstressed syllables leading to an increase in the frequency of content terms . this disruption is also found in standard duple verse , but in crace s text it may be the principal source of disruption , with syntactical and word length distortions playing a much smaller part . the tendency to use more disyllables is relevant here , though its dictional effects , on the frequency of the various parts of speech for example , are at present unknown .",
    "on such a view the text is experimental in the sense that it varies the proportions of the disruptive influences in order to produce new experiences for readers . it might be seen as an attempt to provide prose with some of the richness of effect familiar from isometric verse without suffering to the same degree its disablements , and should be compared with experimental works such as eliot s _ four quartets _ which approach the problem from the other side , and beginning from a verse base move towards the freedom of prose without losing the benefits of disruption ( see constable ( 1998 ) for a discussion of the decline of isometric verse and the rise of prose in terms of disruption theory ) .",
    "comparison of these two texts sheds light on the relationship between mathematical lineation and rhythmical organisation . in one case , _ four quartets _ , we have rhythmical organisation with and without mathematical lineation , whereas in _ quarantine _ we find both mathematical lineation and rhythmical organisation , but with lineation only appearing as an unconscious byproduct of the attempt to create regular rhythmical effects .",
    "this may shed some light on the roots of visible and salient lineation as a metrical rule , since we can see that even when an author is not aware of lineation as a constraint , which is arguably the case in preliterate composers , lineation may arise as a byproduct of rhythmical regularity .",
    "what we have in crace is some evidence suggesting that lineation is a likely , indeed a very probable outcome of rhythmical organisation .",
    "we hypothesize that the roots of lineation as a metrical restriction are deep , at least in english , and that mathematical lineation may be coeval with rhythmical patterning .",
    "its extraction and development into a separately understood metrical object , the line , is likely to have come much later .",
    "what is particularly interesting is that while lineation should have been recognized as independent of rhythm ( i.e. in syllabic verse ) , there has been no parallel recognition of regular rhythmical patterning without isometric lineation .",
    "but , and this is the most interesting point arising from eliot s texts , lineation would appear to be unnecessary to some degree of rhythmical organisation , and with care it seems possible that it may be avoided .",
    "we speculate that eliot s experimental work in _ four quartets _ is not an isolated example , and that others may be found in seventeenth century drama , particularly in shakespeare .",
    "nevertheless , even if such antecedents are found it seems likely that regularly rhythmical but unlineated text is a largely unexplored technical possibility , one which does not come about by chance with any great frequency and one which is difficult to achieve deliberately , certainly without detailed knowledge .",
    "it is also possible that given other features of english , namely those relating to word length , part of speech frequency , and stress , that mathematical lineation is an all but unavoidable consequence of definite rhythmical patterning if noticeably unnatural output is to be avoided .",
    "further theoretical work is expected to permit more conclusive comments on this matter .",
    "interesting though _ quarantine _ is , our tests show that there is still room for further experimentation in this vein , and the abstract understanding of lineation offered in this paper and our previous papers , may go some way to assisting writers in devising composition methods which further minimize lineation .",
    "the psychological effects of text of this type are quite unknown , but it is conceivable that a diction somewhat distorted by the construction of rhythmical regularity would combine with very well with a syntax undisrupted by non - random word length ordering , and perhaps produce a formal constraint as vigorous and attractive to readers as isometric verse once was .",
    "the characters of eliot s _ quartets _ and crace s _ quarantine _ as revealed here both act as an incitement to reconceive the relationship between verse and prose .",
    "colloquial and academic literary critical discussion , has generally treated ` verse ' and ` prose ' as intuitively obvious exclusive categories separated by an ill - defined grey area .",
    "this essentialist tendency has been encouraged by the binary leanings of generative metrics , and our own work on the computable distinction between prose and verse might even be seen as reinforcing this habit . however , there is nothing in the facts of the matter which obliges us to conceive of prose and verse in this rigid way , and we believe that careful consideration of our theoretical research will show that there are very good reasons for taking up an alternative conception , namely that what we think of as _ typical verse _ and _ typical prose _ are _ distinguishable clusters of texts positioned on a continuum_.    underlying such a view is the fundamental insight that while isometric verse involves an ordering of word length this is not a feature which is either absolutely present or absent , but one that varies in degree between texts .",
    "thus we may say that there is a continuum between random disorder of word length on one side and maximal order on the other .",
    "from an abstract theoretical perspective we can see that any particular text may lie at some point along this continuum , but practically speaking there are considerable difficulties in the way of assigning it to a precise position . however , this need not deter us from recognizing the utility of the continuum as a conception , and in this light the difficulties of text assignment appear as technical challenges rather than as obstacles to accepting the continuum in the first place .    a key issue in addressing this matter will be a refined understanding of word length ordering .",
    "all the prose texts we have so far studied in fact exhibit a very small degree of order in the fine structure of the word length profile ( see aoyama and constable ( 1999 ) , and constable and aoyama ( 1999 ) ) , and so seem to lie at some distance from the theoretical prose pole , while at the other extreme no text so far examined is without randomness in its word length characteristics , and thus lies at some distance from the theoretical verse pole . in between we",
    "can be fairly confident that some texts we have studied lie closer to the theoretical maximum of order , such as longfellow s _ hiawatha _ , which has a very marked repeating structure in its @xmath0 , while others seem to lie closer to the disordered pole , such as most blank verse by wordsworth , whose normative line length peaks are modest in size and whose multiple peaks diminish rapidly as a result of weak long range correlation ( i.e. high frequency of variant lines ) .",
    "the location of a text such as crace s _ quarantine _ is more difficult to determine . as noted above , while it exhibits a repeating structure it has no major peak ( i.e. no predominant line length ) , but instead a whole series of minor peaks . at present",
    "we are not in a position to distinguish definitively between the degree of order in such a text and that in , for example , a fundamentally isometric text such as wordsworth s _ prelude_. it is tempting to suppose that _ quarantine _ must lie closer to the prose end of the continuum , on account of its lack of concentrated order , but this , though convenient , may be no more than a residual effect of the exclusive categories that the conception of the continuum was introduced to replace .",
    "satisfactory resolution of this matter will not be possible until some better method has been determined for remarking upon the degrees of order and disorder in a text s lineation structure , and it may be noted here in passing that the fourier analysis will probably of use in this regard .",
