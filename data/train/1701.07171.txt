    "all amplitudes that follow from of wzw action are given entirely in terms of the electric charge @xmath2 and the weak pion decay constant @xmath3 .    a well - studied process that follows from wzw action is decay of a neutral pseudoscalar meson into two photons or production of a neutral pseudoscalar ( ps ) mesons in @xmath4 collisions .",
