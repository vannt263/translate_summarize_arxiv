    "while soft x - ray emission from massive ob stars has been discovered more than thirty years ago @xcite , only in recent years , thanks to the great sensitivity of the x - ray instrumentation carried by the  and  satellites , it has become possible to reveal in the x - ray range also hot stars with much smaller masses and luminosities , such as the hot subdwarfs .",
    "these stars have high temperatures , corresponding to o and b spectral types , but luminosity values that place them below the main sequence in the hr diagram .",
    "the b type subdwarfs ( sdbs ) have masses of @xmath00.5@xmath1 , effective temperatures 20 @xmath2 40 kk , and surface gravities 5 @xmath3 log @xmath4 6 .",
    "they are interpreted as evolved low - mass stars that lost most of their hydrogen envelopes and are now in the he core burning phase .",
    "subdwarfs of o spectral type ( sdos ) constitute a less homogeneous group compared to the sdbs .",
    "they show a large range of temperatures ( 40 @xmath2 100 kk ) and surface gravities 4 @xmath3 log @xmath4 7 , and comprise both he - rich and he - poor stars .",
    "x - ray emission associated with a hot subdwarf was seen for the first time in 1979 ( see sect .  [ sec_hd ] ) , but it took almost two decades to demonstrate that most of the observed x - rays actually originate from its compact companion star @xcite . since then , little progress has been made in this field , until the developments of the last few years .",
    "extensive information on hot subdwarfs can be found in the excellent review by @xcite , which , however , does not cover their high - energy properties , having been written before most of the results described below were obtained .",
    "the aim of this paper is to review the x - ray properties of hot subdwarfs and discuss their relevance in the context of our understanding of mass - loss from hot stars . after a brief introduction on the x - ray emission from early type stars and on the current knowledge of mass - loss in hot subdwarfs ( sect .",
    "[ sec_relevance ] ) , we describe all the available x - ray observations of hot subdwarfs in sect .",
    "[ sec_obs ] .",
    "the interpretation of these observations , in particular their implications on the stellar wind properties and on the subdwarfs with compact companions , are discussed in sect .  [ sec_disc ] .",
    "there are two main processes that can lead to the production of x - rays in hot subdwarf stars : wind emission and accretion onto a compact companion . in both cases",
    ", x - ray observations can give information on the star properties , although , strictly speaking , the latter process does not involve emission from the hot subdwarf itself .",
    "the detection of accretion - powered emission gives the possibility to discover the hot subdwarfs with white dwarf or neutron star companions , which are predicted from evolutionary calculations , but not easily identified with optical observations .",
    "it is well known that early - type stars can generate x - rays if their stellar winds contain plasma sufficiently hot to emit in this energy range . in the following",
    ", we will call this process `` intrinsic '' x - ray emission . extrapolating to lower luminosities the empirical relation between x - ray and bolometric luminosity observed in normal ob stars , @xmath5 = 10@xmath6 @xcite",
    ", one can estimate the expected x - ray emission for hot subdwarfs .",
    "this leads to expected x - ray luminosities of the order of 10@xmath7 erg s@xmath8 and 10@xmath9 erg s@xmath8 for o and b type subdwarfs , respectively .",
    "it must be remembered , however , that the above average relation has a large scatter .",
    "the second possibility is that x - rays are produced by accretion onto a compact companion star , which can be either a white dwarf ( wd ) or a neutron star ( ns ) .",
    "as a first approximation , the accretion rate can be estimated using the bondi - hoyle formalism , according to which the accretion radius onto an object of mass @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the wind velocity and @xmath13 is the orbital velocity .",
    "the mass accretion rate @xmath14 is related to the relative velocity @xmath15 and to the wind density by @xmath16 .",
    "the wind density @xmath17 at the position of the compact object can be estimated as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the wind mass - loss rate from the subdwarf and @xmath20 is the orbital separation . from these relations",
    "one obtains the accretion - powered luminosity of a star with mass @xmath10 and radius @xmath21    @xmath22    obviously , accretion onto a companion and intrinsic emission are not mutually exclusive , and both processes can occur in binary subdwarfs . in the lack of adequate x - ray data , it can be difficult to distinguish between the two possibilities , but , in both cases , the x - ray emission depends on the properties of the subdwarf s stellar wind .",
    "therefore , x - ray observations provide a new diagnostic tool to investigate the poorly constrained mass - loss processes occurring in these stars .      stars of o and b spectral type are sources of soft x - rays with luminosity up to a few 10@xmath23 erg s@xmath8 and thermal spectra corresponding to plasma temperatures of a few million degrees .",
    "as well demonstrated , e.g. , by the case of @xmath24 puppis @xcite , high resolution x - ray spectra of the brightest ob stars can provide a wealth of information through the study of emission lines .",
    "however , for the majority of the early type stars detected in x - rays , only low resolution spectra are available , which can be adequately fit using simple models of thermal plasma emission .",
    "for example , the spectra of a large sample of massive ob stars detected with  were described with either a single mekal model with kt@xmath00.21 kev , or with the the sum of two or three mekal models of different temperatures @xcite .",
    "these data also showed evidence for additional absorption , probably occurring in the stellar wind , in o stars but not in b stars .",
    "early - type stars are characterized by winds with typical mass - loss rates @xmath19 in the range 10@xmath2510@xmath26 @xmath1 yr@xmath8 and terminal velocities of a few thousands km s@xmath8 .",
    "it is believed that the observed x - rays are produced in these stellar winds , where the gas is shock - heated by instabilities ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "the main properties of the winds in ob stars are explained in the context of the radiative line - driven wind theory @xcite , according to which part of the radial momentum of the photons emitted from the star is transferred to the wind matter through line absorption and reemission .",
    "the theory predicts a dependence of @xmath19 on the star luminosity approximately given by @xmath19 @xmath27 , with @xmath281.52 .",
    "since the photon absorption / emission process occurs mainly in the metals present in the wind , the mass - loss rate depends also on the metallicity @xmath29 , with @xmath19 @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "these theoretical scaling laws are generally in good agreement with the observational data .",
    "however , some discrepancies have been found in stars with low - density winds , which show mass - loss rates one or two orders of magnitude below the predicted values @xcite .",
    "such discrepancies might be , at least partially , explained by the fact that the uv line diagnostics used in these stars underestimate the actual mass - loss rates .",
    "the study of hot subdwarfs in the x - ray band , providing alternative handles on the properties of weak winds , can be of interest in this respect .",
    "as mentioned above , the theory of radiatively - driven winds predicts that , for a given temperature and composition , the mass - loss rate scales with the star luminosity .",
    "this leads to the simple expectations that the winds of hot subdwarfs should be weaker than those of main sequence , giant and supergiant ob stars and that sdos should have stronger winds than sdbs .",
    "these predictions are indeed confirmed by the observations : evidence for stellar winds has been reported for some sdos , but not yet conclusively for any sdb star .",
    "in fact , the mass - loss rates of a few sdos have been derived from the p - cygni profiles of the c@xmath32 and n@xmath33 lines in the uv , yielding values of @xmath3410@xmath35 @xmath1 yr@xmath8 @xcite . on the other hand , for what concerns sdb stars",
    ", the only evidence for mass - loss comes from the observation of a few objects with anomalous profiles of the h@xmath36 and hei lines , interpreted as possible hints of a weak stellar wind @xcite .",
    "@xcite computed models of radiation - driven winds for low mass stars with 10 kk @xmath37 35 kk , obtaining the following relation between the mass - loss rate and the star mass , @xmath10 , luminosity , @xmath38 , and metallicity @xmath29 : @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41    the range of validity of this relation ( 0.5 @xmath42 0.7 , 1.3 @xmath3 log@xmath43 1.7 , and 0.1 @xmath44 10 ) is appropriate for sdb stars . fig .",
    "[ fig_vc02 ] shows the mass - loss rates as a function of @xmath45 , computed with this relation for the case of @xmath46 and different values of @xmath38 and @xmath29 .",
    "@xcite computed mass - loss rates for sdbs obtaining values similar to those of @xcite for stars of solar metallicity , but much lower values in the case of @xmath47 and high surface gravities .",
    "the wind composition is an important parameter affecting the mass - loss rate , but unfortunately only limited information on the metallicity of hot subdwarfs is available .",
    "the above theoretical estimates for @xmath48 are based on the assumption that the wind behaves as a single fluid , i.e. there is sufficient coulomb coupling between the metals which are accelerated and the h and he atoms which constitute the bulk of the wind matter .",
    "such a condition might not be valid in very low - density winds @xcite .",
    ".hot subdwarfs detected in x - rays [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab_spec ]    @xmath49 mass fraction .",
    "this luminous and he - rich sdo has been dubbed the spectroscopic twin of , because the optical / uv spectral properties of these two stars are very similar .",
    "the x - ray emission from  was discovered thanks to a   survey of a flux - limited sample of sdos @xcite and recently studied in more detail with a dedicated  observation in which it was detected in the 0.15 - 1.5 kev range @xcite .",
    "its very soft x - ray spectrum is well fit by the sum of two thermal plasma models with temperatures of about 0.13 kev and 0.8 kev , provided that adequate elemental abundances are used ( see details in table  [ tab_spec ] ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosity is @xmath51 erg s@xmath8 ( for d=2.7 kpc ) .",
    "a search for periodicities gave negative results , but , given the faint x - ray flux , the upper limits on the pulsed fraction are not particularly constraining .",
    "is a bright and relatively well studied star in the optical / uv bands and no radial velocity variations have been reported in the literature .",
    "it is thus natural to interpret these results in terms of intrinsic x - ray emission from the sdo star .      and feige 34 are the only other sdos detected in the   survey carried out by @xcite .",
    "being very faint sources ( x - ray fluxes of a few 10@xmath52 erg s@xmath8 ) , they yielded only a few counts in these short observations : enough for a significant detection in the low - background  hrc - i instrument , but insufficient for a timing analysis .",
    "the parallax of  obtained with _ hipparcos",
    "_ implies a very small distance .",
    "therefore , this star , with an x - ray luminosity of only @xmath53 erg s@xmath8 , is the closest hot subdwarf detected in the x - ray band .",
    "note that the angular resolution of the  data is sufficiently good to unambiguosly associate the observed x - ray emission to  and not to a faint companion star lying at an angular distance of only 2.8 arcsec @xcite .",
    "a detailed analysis of the uv and optical spectra of   with nlte models indicates a surface gravity in the range 6.1@xmath3log @xmath46.5 @xcite .",
    "thus , contrary to the three objects discussed in the previous subsections , this star belongs to the class of low - luminosity , compact sdos .",
    "the same might be true for feige 34 , for which @xcite derived log @xmath54=6.8 ( this is , however , at variance with the value log @xmath54=5.2 reported by @xcite ) .",
    "feige 34 has an infrared excess which might result either from free - free emission in a wind or from a late type companion star .",
    "the latter possibility is favored by the analysis of @xcite , who estimate that the putative companion should be of m2 spectral type . since also late - type stars are known x - ray emitters , it can not be excluded that ( part of ) the observed x - ray emission is due to the putative companion .      up to now",
    ", no sdb star has been detected at x - ray energies .",
    "the recent observations carried out with sensitive satellites focussed on sdbs in binaries with either confirmed or candidate compact companions .",
    "although none of the observed targets were detected , these observations are relevant because they provide upper limits that are orders of magnitude smaller than those previously available from the _ rosat _ all sky survey .",
    "is the most interesting sdb for which a deep upper limit on the x - ray luminosity has been obtained .",
    "contrary to the case of the other sdb binaries discussed below , the presence of a compact companion is certain : it is a wd with a dynamically - measured mass of 0.7 @xmath1 , orbiting the subdwarf star with a period of only 1.2 hr , the shortest known among sdb binaries @xcite .",
    "a 50 ks long observation with  yielded a luminosity upper limit of l@xmath55 erg s@xmath8 ( for d=364 pc ) , which , as discussed in sect .  [ sec_ul ] , provides interesting constraints on the mass - loss rate from this sdb @xcite .",
    "the presence of a compact companion has been suggested for several other sdb stars .",
    "these systems with `` candidate '' compact companions have been selected by means of radial and rotational velocity measurements of single - lined spectroscopic binaries @xcite .",
    "the assumption of synchronous rotation in these systems allows one to estimate the orbit inclination and thus to set a lower limit to the mass of the companion . if this limit exceeds the value expected for a late - type main - sequence star , it is likely that the companion is a wd or a ns . a search for x - ray emission from a sample of twelve such systems , chosen among those with the lowest interstellar absorption and shortest orbital periods ,",
    "was carried out with the  satellite @xcite .",
    "upper limits in the range @xmath56 erg s@xmath8 were obtained for their x - ray luminosities ( table  [ tab_ul ] ) .",
    "the implications for the wind mass - loss rates of these sdbs are discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec_ul ] .",
    "in fig .  [ fig_lxlbol ]",
    "we compare the x - ray and bolometric luminosities of the sdo stars to those of the normal o - type stars seen in the _ rosat _ all sky survey @xcite . for the case of",
    "we consider here only the x - rays observed during the eclipse of its compact companion , which are most likely due to intrinsic emission from the sdo star .",
    "it is clear that the luminosities of the five sdos detected in x - rays , as well as the upper limits of the undetected ones , are consistent with an extrapolation of the average relation @xmath5 = 10@xmath6 followed by the more luminous o - type stars @xcite .    from the x - ray spectral point of view , the sdos are similar to the normal o - type stars . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_mekal ] , good fits to the x - ray spectra of   ( during the eclipse ) ,  and   can be obtained with the sum of two or three plasma emission models with different temperatures , provided that the proper element abundances are adopted .",
    "it is interesting to note that these three x - ray emitting sdos are among the few hot subdwarfs for which evidence of mass - loss has been reported .",
    "no spectral information is available for the two remaining faint sdos , which were only observed with the  hrc instrument .",
    "these findings suggest that the process of x - ray emission due to wind instabilities and shock heating is not restricted to the dense winds of the luminous and massive hot stars , but it can also operate in the weak winds of sdo stars .",
    "the five sdos detected in x - rays have rather different atmospheric compositions :  and   have almost pure he atmospheres and are c - rich @xcite ;  has one atom of he for each of h and is n - rich @xcite ; the compact sdo   has solar he and subsolar to solar abundances of several metals @xcite ; finally , he is slightly deficient for feige 34 , while fe and ni are enhanced by factors of 10 and 70 @xcite .",
    "these characteristics can in principle cause differences in their winds which might be explored with future , more sensitive x - ray observations .      while the possible presence of a compact companion in  needs a confirmation of the reported 19 s periodicity , there is no doubt that the spectroscopic binary  hosts either a wd or a ns spinning with a period of 13.2 s. as discussed below , accretion onto this compact object is the most natural explanation for the observed pulsed x - rays .",
    "the presence of a power - law spectral component rules out a purely thermal emission powered by the internal heat of a cooling ns , while the possibility of rotation - powered emission seems unlikely .",
    "the x - ray luminosity of a rotation - powered ns or wd with spin period p=2@xmath57/@xmath58 is @xmath59 = @xmath60i@xmath58@xmath61 , where @xmath60 is the efficiency of conversion of rotational energy into radiation and @xmath62 is the moment of inertia . if the  companion is a ns ( @xmath63 g @xmath64 ) , the minimum spin - down rate required to power the observed luminosity is @xmath65 s s@xmath8 , barely compatible with the current upper limit @xmath66 s s@xmath8 @xcite .",
    "thus rotation - powered emission from a ns can be ruled out , unless an implausibly high efficiency is invoked . in the case of a wd companion",
    "( @xmath67 g @xmath64 ) , the required @xmath68 , being a factor @xmath69 smaller , would be compatible with the observations .",
    "a strongly magnetized wd could accelerate relativistic particles , likewise a radio pulsar , thus producing non - thermal magnetospheric x - ray emission . although the existence of rotation - powered `` wd - pulsars '' has been proposed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , none have been found so far . also considering that the energetically - dominant thermal component in the  x - ray spectrum would be difficult to explain in this scenario ,",
    "we conclude that the possibility of rotation - powered emission is quite unlikely and concentrate in the following on the accretion scenario .",
    "independent on the wd or ns nature of the companion star ,  does not fill its roche - lobe .",
    "therefore , accretion in this binary occurs by capture of the sdo stellar wind and the expected x - ray luminosity can be estimated with eq .",
    "@xcite , based on the wind parameters of  available at that time @xcite , concluded that the compact object is a wd , since an accreting ns would have been more luminous than observed .",
    "an updated estimate of the mass - loss rate ( log @xmath19 = 9.2 yr@xmath8 ) and wind terminal velocity ( @xmath12=1200 km s@xmath8 ) has been recently obtained ( w. hamann , private communication , for d=0.6 kpc ) . with these values and a radius of 3000 km , appropriate for a massive wd , eq .",
    "( 1 ) gives a luminosity of @xmath70 erg s@xmath8 , which is in reasonable agreement with the observed value of @xmath71 erg s@xmath8 .",
    "for the alternative possibility of an accreting ns ( r=10 km ) , eq .",
    "( 1 ) would give @xmath72 erg s@xmath8 .",
    "even taking into account that the total luminosity , including the unobserved contribution of the blackbody component below 0.2 kev , could be a factor @xmath04 higher than the above value , it seems difficult to reconcile the expected ns luminosity with the observations , unless the source distance is greatly underestimated .",
    "@xcite discussed an evolutionary path leading to a system like .",
    "this involves an initial binary with masses of @xmath089 @xmath1 in which the wd , formed from the originally more massive star , is engulfed in the envelope of the secondary , when the latter expanded to become a red - giant with a non degenerate he core .",
    "this leads to the expulsion of the common envelope and to the emergence of a much more compact binary , composed of a co or one wd and a he - star , as currently observed .",
    "is now within its roche - lobe , but it will expand again in the future , transferring he - rich matter onto its companion at a higher rate . if the companion is indeed a massive wd , this could lead to a type ia supernova explosion or to the formation of a rapidly spinning ns through accretion - induced collapse @xcite .",
    "being the descendent of intermediate mass stars ( @xmath089 @xmath1 ) , the  binary would be the progenitor of a type ia supernova with a short delay time , unless , as suggested by @xcite , the explosion is delayed due to the fast rotation of the wd . in the alternative case of accretion - induced collapse , the resulting ns would probably have a high rotational velocity .",
    "this would be an evolutionary path to create millisecond pulsars without going through recycling in a low mass x - ray binary @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite performed population synthesis computations of different evolutionary channels leading to the formation of one wd + he - star binaries .",
    "they found that systems with long orbital period and high he - star mass , as observed in , are rarely formed and conclude that the companion of  is more likely to be a co wd , which can reach chandrasekhar mass limit and produce a type ia sn after a few 10@xmath73 years of mass transfer , as computed by @xcite .",
    "the non - detection of accretion - powered x - ray emission in binaries containing compact objects ( sect .",
    "[ sec_ulsdb ] ) can be used to constrain the properties of stellar winds from the hot subdwarfs in these systems .",
    "thanks to their higher x - ray efficiency , binaries containing nss can provide more stringent limits than those containing wds . although no confirmed ns+sd system has been found yet , a few candidates which deserve further study have been proposed @xcite .",
    "we note that the constraints on the stellar mass - loss derived in this way are affected by a few uncertainties , such as the source distances , the x - ray spectrum assumed to convert count rates to fluxes , the accretion model and geometry used to relate the x - ray luminosity to the mass accretion rate . with these caveats in mind , we can discuss the results obtained for the wd+sdb binary   @xcite and for a dozen of other sdb binaries which are suspected to host compact objects @xcite .    under the assumption of bondi - hoyle accretion ( eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) , and assuming a power law spectrum with photon index @xmath74=2 , a 3@xmath75 upper limit of @xmath76 @xmath1 yr@xmath8 was derived for the mass - loss rate of .",
    "the distance of this source is well known ( 364 pc , @xcite ) , thus the main uncertainty is related to the assumed x - ray spectrum . as discussed in @xcite , any thermal spectrum with temperature in the range 0.1 - 10 kev , would give a limit on @xmath19 in the range",
    "@xmath77 @xmath1 yr@xmath8",
    ". this value is inconsistent with the theoretical predictions of @xcite if  has solar or higher abundances ( see fig .  [ fig_vc02 ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig_vc02 ] we show also the upper limits on @xmath19 obtained from the x - ray observations of three sdb binaries which might have ns companions @xcite .",
    "these limits are quite constraining , but subject to the effective presence of a ns in these systems , which is based on the mass limits derived under the assumption that the subdwarf rotates synchronously .",
    "further observations to confirm this are required . on the other hand , the current upper limits derived for the other sdb stars with proposed wd companions are two or three orders of magnitude higher and thus not particularly constraining for the theoretical models .",
    "the results obtained for the small , but rapidly growing , sample of hot subdwarfs detected in the x - ray range , show the potential of x - ray observations in the study of these objects .",
    "unfortunately , detailed analysis such as those carried out for several normal ob stars can not be done for these relatively faint sources .",
    "for example , the element abundances of the thermal plasma models used to fit the sdo spectra could not be constrained by the x - ray data currently available .",
    "therefore , the abundances had to be fixed to the values derived from optical studies , when available , or otherwise based on informed best guesses",
    ".    the increased sensitivity and spectral resolution of future x - ray telescopes will provide much better information on the spectral properties of the x - ray emission and lead to the discovery of many new sources . as an illustration of what could be obtained with _",
    "athena _ , the next large x - ray satellite approved by the european space agency for a launch in the late 2020s",

    "the analysis of these simulated data ( see fig .  [ fig_simu ] ) indicate that it will be possible to obtain much more accurate measures of the plasma temperatures and constrain within @xmath010% the abundances of c , n , o , si and fe , providing a measure independent of that derived from optical / uv analysis .",
    "it is also important to increase the sample of hot subdwarfs detected in x - rays in order to consolidate the comparison with normal early type stars and to explore possible dependences on different parameters , such as surface gravity , temperature and composition .",
    "while future satellites will certainly allow us to reach fainter limiting fluxes , also the current facilities can in principle provide many new detections , since only a very small number of targets have been observed so far .",
    "one interesting question is whether isolated sdb stars are x - ray emitters .",
    "more optical / uv studies of the x - ray emitting hot subdwarfs are needed to derive better estimates of their atmospheric and wind parameters",
    ". the accurate distances which will soon be provided by the _ gaia _",
    "mission will be crucial to reduce many of the uncertainties involved in these estimates .",
    "a multi - wavelength approach can be very effective to discover other systems such as   and , in which the presence of a compact companion is certain .",
    "besides their intrinsic interest from the point of view of binary evolution models , such systems will allow us to fully exploit the x - ray data to better characterize the poorly known winds of hot subdwarfs .",
    "we thank the organizers of the science event `` x - ray astrophysics of hot massive stars '' at the 2014 cospar in moscow and the participants to the seventh meeting on hot subdwarfs in oxford for very interesting discussions .",
