    "inflation in the early universe explains the flatness , horizon , and entropy problems in the standard big bang cosmology , while providing a seed of the large scale structure and the anisotropy in cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation observed today .",
    "if the energy scale of inflation is high enough , the de sitter quantum fluctuation of spacetime metric can give rise to a primordial tensor perturbation which might be large enough to be detectable in the near future .",
    "on the other hand , such high scale inflation demands a super - planckian excursion of the inflaton  @xcite , so a scalar potential which is flat over a super - planckian range of the inflaton field . in view of the uv sensitivity of scalar potential , this is a nontrivial condition required for the underlying theory of inflation .",
    "as is well known , a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson @xmath0 can have a naturally flat potential over a field range comparable to its decay constant @xmath1 .",
    "the low energy potential is protected from unknown uv physics under the simple assumption that uv physics respects an approximate global symmetry which is non - linearly realized in the low energy limit as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a real constant . in the natural inflation scenario",
    "@xcite , inflaton is assumed to be a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson having a sinusoidal potential generated by non - perturbative dynamics .",
    "then the inflationary slow - roll parameters have a size of @xmath4 , and therefore the model requires @xmath5 , where @xmath6 gev is the reduced planck scale .",
    "although it appears to be technically natural within the framework of effective field theory , there has been a concern that the required super - planckian decay constant may not have a uv completion consistent with quantum gravity  @xcite . also , previous studies on the axion decay constants in string theory suggest that generically @xmath7 , at least in the perturbative regime  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , one can engineer the model to get a super - plackian axion decay constant within the framework of effective field theory @xcite , or even in string theory @xcite .",
    "an interesting approach along this direction is the aligned natural inflation @xcite . in this scheme ,",
    "initially one starts with multiple axions , all having a sub - planckian decay constant .",
    "provided that the axion couplings are aligned to get a specific form of axion potential @xcite , a helical flat direction with multiple windings is formed in the multi - dimensional field space with sub - planckian volume .",
    "if the number of windings is large enough , this flat direction can have a super - planckian length , so result in an inflaton with super - planckian effective decay constant .",
    "recently there has been a renewed interest in the implication of the weak gravity conjecture ( wgc )  @xcite for the aligned natural inflation .",
    "the wgc was proposed initially for @xmath8 gauge interaction  @xcite , implying that there should exist a charged particle with mass @xmath9 and charge @xmath10 satisfying @xmath11 , so the gravity should be weaker than the @xmath8 gauge force , while in the mild version the required particle with @xmath11 does not have to be the lightest charged particle .",
    "here we are mostly concerned with the mild version generalized to the case of multiple axions . ] . when translated to axions",
    ", the wgc suggests that there should exist an instanton which couples to the corresponding axion with a strength stronger than the gravity .",
    "this leads to an upper bound on the decay constant of individual axion , which is given by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the euclidean action of the instanton  @xcite",
    ".    it has been noticed @xcite that for models with multiple @xmath8 gauge interactions , the wgc often leads to a stronger constraint on the charge - to - mass ratios than the one obtained by considering the individual @xmath8 separately .",
    "the reason is that the wgc applies for all directions in the multi - dimensional charge space , not just for the charge vectors of the individual particles . for the case of multiple axions ,",
    "one similarly obtains a stronger constraint on the axion couplings  @xcite .",
    "one then finds  @xcite that the alignment mechanism _ can not _ be compatible with the constraint from the wgc _ if _ the axion - instanton couplings required by the wgc coincide with the couplings generating the axion potential that implements the alignment mechanism .",
    "a simple solution to this problem is that some of the instantons required by the wgc do not participate in implementing the alignment mechanism  @xcite .",
    "since some part of the axion potential for the alignment mechanism could be induced by either perturbative effects such as flux or other forms of nonperturbative effects such as hidden gaugino condensation , this appears to be a rather plausible possibility .",
    "indeed , known string theoretic construction of the aligned natural inflation involves an instanton which is not relevant for the alignment mechanism @xcite . yet",
    ", such instanton can generate an additional axion potential which does not affect the alignment mechanism as it corresponds to a subleading correction , but may give rise to an observable consequence in the precision cmb data .",
    "as we will see , in the presence of such instanton , the low energy inflaton potential is generically given by and @xmath14 , whose observational consequences are different from our case with @xmath15 and @xmath16 . ]",
    "v_eff ( ) = _ eff^4 + _ mod^4 , where the first term with @xmath17 corresponds to the dominant inflaton potential generated by a dynamics implementing the alignment mechanism , while the second term with @xmath18 and @xmath19 is a subleading modulation generated by an instanton which is required by the wgc , but does not participate in implementing the alignment mechanism .    in this paper",
    ", we first provide an argument implying that the presence of subleading modulation in the inflaton potential is a generic feature of the aligned natural inflation consistent with the wgc .",
    "we then study the observable consequences of such modulation , while focusing on the parameter region favored by theoretical or phenomenological considerations .",
    "specifically we consider the region @xmath20 to avoid a fine tuning of the initial condition , while being consistent with the cmb data  @xcite , and @xmath21 which is suggested by the wgc .",
    "observable consequences of modulation in the axion monodromy inflation were studied extensively in  @xcite , where it was noticed that modulation can lead to an oscillatory behavior of the power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation .",
    "we examine the constraint from cmb on modulations for the case of aligned natural inflation , and find that the cmb data restrict the amplitude of modulation as @xmath22 , depending upon the value of @xmath23 .",
    "it has been pointed out that modulation may significantly change the predicted value of the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath24 in natural inflation scenario @xcite .",
    "we find that the change of the predicted value of @xmath24 due to modulation is minor , e.g. at most of @xmath25% , if the amplitude of modulation is within the range compatible with the observed cmb data within the ( aligned ) natural inflation , see @xcite . ] . on the other hand , including an oscillatory part of the curvature power spectrum in data - fitting analysis , we find that a larger parameter region in the @xmath26 plane can be compatible with the cmb data compared to the case without an oscillatory piece , where @xmath27 denotes the spectral index of the curvature power spectrum .",
    "this makes it possible that the potential tension between the cmb data and the natural inflation scenario is ameliorated under the assumption that there exists a modulation of the inflaton potential yielding a proper size of oscillatory piece in the curvature power spectrum .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ model ] , we revisit the weak gravity conjecture applied for models with multiple axions , as well as the kim - nilles - peloso ( knp ) alignment mechanism .",
    "we argue that a small modulation of the inflaton potential is a generic feature of the aligned natural inflation compatible with the wgc . in section  [ cmb ] , we study the oscillations in the curvature power spectrum induced by modulation , and discuss the constraints on the model from the cmb data . section  [ conclusion ] is the conclusion .",
    "in this section , we revisit the weak gravity conjecture applied for the aligned natural inflation , as well as the alignment mechanism . as we will see , the wgc implies that generically there can be a small modulation of the inflation potential , with a period determined by sub - planckian axion scale .",
    "let us begin with the constraint on the axion couplings for models with multiple axions , which is referred to the _ convex hull condition _",
    "( chc )  @xcite .",
    "it requires first that in the presence of @xmath28 axions , @xmath29 there exist corresponding ( at least ) @xmath28 instantons generating axion - dependent physical amplitudes as _ i ( -s_i + i_i ) ( i=1,2, ... ,n),where @xmath30 denotes the euclidean action of the @xmath31-th instanton , and the axion - instanton couplings @xmath32 are linearly independent from each other .",
    "it is always possible to parametrize the axion - instanton couplings as _ i= ( , , ... , ) , where @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) can be identified as the decay constant of the @xmath35-th axion , and @xmath36 are integer - valued model parameters , so the instanton amplitudes are periodic under the axion shift : _ i",
    "_ i + 2f_i.in the following , we will assume for simplicity that all instanton actions have a common value bigger than the unity for a certain coupling constant @xmath37 , and then a strong - weak coupling duality on @xmath37 may provide a firm basis on our assumption that @xmath38 . ] , e.g. @xmath39 by taking an analogy to the case of multiple @xmath8 gauge fields , it has been argued that the axion - instanton couplings should be stronger than the gravity in _ all _ directions in the @xmath28-dimensional coupling space .",
    "specifically , one finds that the convex hull spanned by _",
    "i should contain the @xmath28-dimensional unit ball with a center at the origin .",
    "equivalently , one needs |q_i|",
    "> i , and for an _ arbitrary _ unit vector @xmath40 , |uq_i| > i. [ chc ]    the above convex hull condition has an immediate consequence on the aligned natural inflation . to see this ,",
    "let us consider a simple two axion model for the alignment mechanism , which has the following knp - type axion potential : v_0 =",
    "_ 1 ^ 4 + _ 2 ^ 4 , where the axion couplings @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) can be parametrized as _ 1 = ( , ) _ 2 = ( , ) with integer - valued @xmath43 .",
    "for @xmath44 , which will be assumed in the following discussion , the above axion potential has an approximately flat direction in the limit that @xmath45 and @xmath46 are aligned to be nearly parallel : _",

    "note that our parametrization of the inflaton direction can receive a correction of @xmath49 , which would give rise to a correction of @xmath50 to @xmath51 .",

    "[ rfigure ] , we depict also the contours representing the 68% and 95% cl range of @xmath138 compatible with the observed cmb data .",
    "red contours are the results when @xmath107 is allowed to freely vary within the corresponding observational bounds , while the blue contours are the results when @xmath107 is frozen to be vanishing .",
    "our results imply that the parameter region of @xmath138 compatible with the cmb data is enlarged if there were a proper amount of oscillatory piece in the curvature power spectrum .",
    "this can ameliorate the potential tension between the natural inflation scenario and the cmb data .",
    "for instance , the point with @xmath144 and @xmath145 , which is predicted by natural inflation with @xmath146 , is inside the @xmath130 cl contour in the presence of modulation , while it is outside the @xmath130 cl contour in the absence of modulation .",
    "we finally comment on the primordial non - gaussianity .",
    "modulations of the inflaton potential can give rise to a distinct shape of non - gaussianity , which is known as the _ resonant _ non - gaussianity  @xcite .",
    "in our case , its amplitude is given by f^res_nl = , where @xmath147 .",
    "this type of non - gaussianity rarely overlaps with the other types of non - gaussianity , such as the local , equilateral , and orthogonal non - gaussianities  @xcite . by this reason",
    ", we can not simply apply the constraints on the other types of non - gaussianity for this model . on the other hand ,",
    "the planck collaboration has provided an observational constraint on the resonant non - gaussianity , roughly @xmath148 for a narrow range of frequency with @xmath149  @xcite . in our case , we find @xmath150 when @xmath151 and the amplitude of modulation satisfies the bound from cmb",
    ". therefore the aligned natural inflation with modulations satisfies easily the constraints on the primordial non - gaussianities .",
    "in this paper , we have provided an argument implying that a small modulation of the inflaton potential is a generic feature of the aligned natural inflation consistent with the weak gravity conjecture .",
    "we studied also the observable consequences of modulation in the aligned natural inflation scenario for the theoretically or phenomenologically favored parameter region with @xmath20 and @xmath152 .",
    "we find that the planck cmb data provides a severe bound on the amplitude of modualtion .",
    "although modulation does not cause an appreciable change of the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath24 predicted by the model , it affects the compatibility between the cmb data and the predicted value of @xmath24 , and therefore can ameliorate the potential tension between the cmb data and the natural inflation scenario .",
    "* note added : * + while this paper was being finalized , we received ref .  @xcite discussing the aligned natural inflation with modulations within the framework of string theory embedding . ref .",
    "@xcite discusses also the observable consequences of modulations for lower modulation frequencies than ours .",
