    "supersymmetry is at present the only known framework in which the higgs sector  @xcite of the standard model ( sm ) , so crucial for its internal consistency , is natural  @xcite .",
    "the minimal version of the supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) contains two higgs doublets @xmath15 with opposite hypercharges : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , so as to generate masses for up- and down - type quarks ( and leptons ) , and to cancel gauge anomalies . after spontaneous symmetry breaking induced by the neutral components of @xmath18 and @xmath19 obtaining vacuum expectation values , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , the mssm contains two neutral @xmath0-even ( @xmath1 , @xmath3 ) , one neutral @xmath0-odd ( @xmath5 ) , and two charged ( @xmath23 ) higgs bosons @xcite .",
    "because of gauge invariance and supersymmetry , all the higgs masses and the higgs couplings in the mssm can be described ( at tree level ) in terms of only two parameters , which are usually chosen to be @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the mass of the @xmath0-odd higgs boson .    in particular , all the trilinear self - couplings of the physical higgs particles can be predicted theoretically ( at the tree level ) in terms of @xmath25 and @xmath24 .",
    "once a light higgs boson is discovered , the measurement of these trilinear couplings can be used to reconstruct the higgs potential of the mssm .",
    "this will go a long way toward establishing the higgs mechanism as the basic mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking in gauge theories .",
    "although the measurement of all the higgs couplings in the mssm is a difficult task , preliminary theoretical investigations by plehn , spira and zerwas @xcite , and by djouadi , haber and zerwas ( dhz ) @xcite , of the measurement of these couplings at the lhc and at a high - energy @xmath26 linear collider , respectively , are encouraging .",
    "we have considered in detail @xcite the question of possible measurements of the trilinear higgs couplings of the mssm at a high - energy @xmath26 linear collider .",
    "we assume that such a facility will operate at an energy of 500  gev with an integrated luminosity per year of @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "( this is a factor of 10 more than the earlier estimate . ) in a later phase one may envisage an upgrade to an energy of 1.5  tev .",
    "the trilinear higgs couplings that are of interest are @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath28 , involving both the @xmath0-even and @xmath0-odd higgs bosons .",
    "the couplings @xmath9 and @xmath10 are rather small with respect to the corresponding trilinear coupling @xmath29 in the sm ( for a given mass of the lightest higgs boson @xmath30 ) , unless @xmath30 is close to the upper value ( decoupling limit ) .",
    "the coupling @xmath28 remains small for all parameters .    throughout ,",
    "we include one - loop radiative corrections @xcite to the higgs sector in the effective potential approximation .",
    "in particular , we take into account the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath31 , the soft supersymmetry breaking trilinear parameter and the bilinear higgs(ino ) parameter in the superpotential , respectively , and as a consequence the left  right mixing in the squark sector , in our calculations .",
    "we thus include all the relevant parameters of the mssm in our study @xcite .",
    "related work has recently been presented by dubinin and semenov @xcite .    for a given value of @xmath30",
    ", the values of these couplings significantly depend on the soft supersymmetry - breaking trilinear parameter @xmath5 , as well as on @xmath31 , and thus on the resulting mixing in the squark sector .",
    "since the trilinear couplings tend to be small , and depend on several parameters , their effects are somewhat difficult to estimate .",
    "the dominant source of multiple production of the higgs ( @xmath1 ) boson , is through higgs - strahlung of @xmath3 , and through production of @xmath3 in association with the @xmath0-odd higgs boson .",
    "this source of multiple production can be used to extract the trilinear higgs coupling @xmath9 .",
    "the non - resonant fusion mechanism for multiple @xmath1 production , @xmath32 , involves two trilinear higgs couplings , @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and is useful for extracting @xmath10 .",
    "at the tree level , the higgs sector of the mssm is described by two parameters , which can be conveniently chosen as @xmath25 and @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "there are , however , substantial radiative corrections to the @xmath0-even neutral higgs masses and couplings  @xcite .",
    "they are , in general , positive , and they shift the mass of the lightest mssm higgs boson upwards .",
    "the higgs mass falls rapidly at small values of @xmath24 .",
    "since the lep experiments are obtaining lower bounds on the mass of the lightest higgs boson , they are beginning to rule out significant parts of the small-@xmath24 parameter space , depending on the model assumptions .",
    "aleph finds a lower limit of @xmath33  gev , irrespective of @xmath24 , and a limit of @xmath34  gev for @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "we take @xmath36 to be a representative value .",
    "in units of @xmath37 , the relevant tree - level trilinear higgs couplings are given by @xmath38 with @xmath39 the mixing angle in the @xmath0-even higgs sector , which can be calculated in terms of the parameters appearing in the @xmath0-even higgs mass matrix .",
    "the dominant one - loop radiative corrections are proportional to @xmath40 @xcite .",

    "the mssm trilinear couplings are rather small .",
    "for some value of @xmath30 the couplings @xmath9 and @xmath10 start to increase in magnitude , whereas @xmath28 remains small .",

    "the actual values of @xmath9 and @xmath10 ( for a given value of @xmath30 ) change significantly if @xmath5 becomes large and positive .",
    "a non - vanishing squark - mixing parameter @xmath5 is thus quite important .",
    "also , for special values of the parameters , the couplings may vanish @xcite .    to sum up the behaviour of the trilinear couplings , we note that @xmath9 and @xmath10 are small for @xmath44120  gev , depending on the value of @xmath24 .",
    "however , as @xmath30 approaches its maximum value , which is reached rapidly as @xmath25 becomes large , @xmath45  gev , these trilinear couplings become large .",
