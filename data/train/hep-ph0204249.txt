    "chiral symmetry plays a major role in constraining the spectrum of low energy qcd . at zero density",

    "the quark - gluon interactions which in vacuum break chiral symmetry may in dense matter , _",
    "e.g. _ in the interior of neutron stars , lead to other , novel phases of the quark gluon plasma  @xcite .",
    "the chiral properties of the qcd vacuum at zero temperature and density have been extensively studied in various approaches to soft qcd  @xcite . in principle",
    "one could investigate it using lattice gauge methods .",
    "however , extrapolations of lattice simulations to small quark masses @xmath0 ( chiral extrapolation ) still present a major challenge . in approaches bases on a dyson - schwinger formulation of qcd , dynamical chiral symmetry breaking can be studied by analyzing the behavior of the quark propagator .",
    "even though no systematic truncation scheme of the dyson series in qcd exists , and in a majority of studies model interactions are introduced , the approach gives a good description of the low energy phenomenology .",
    "in particular it enables to correctly predict many of the static properties of the low lying mesons and baryons , _",
    "i.e. _ masses and charge moments , and simultaneously account for the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking as measured by the vacuum expectation value of the scalar quark density , @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "this value follows from pcac , goldstone theorem and the current algebra which result in the gell - mann - oakes - renner ( or thouless theorem ) relation , @xmath2 here , @xmath3 is the current light quark mass , renormalized at the hadronic scale , @xmath4 is the pion decay constant and @xmath5 is the pion mass . without explicit chiral symmetry breaking @xmath6 , the above relation can not be used to determine @xmath7 .",
    "however , as @xmath8 no phase transition to a chirally symmetric state is expected , and therefore the @xmath9 should still be a good estimate of the condensate in the chiral limit .",
    "spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking enables to put the constituent quark representation of hadrons in a firm theoretical ground .",
    "the bare quark states defined with respect to the perturbative vacuum are replaced by quasiparticle excitations of the chirally noninvariant ground state .",
    "residual interactions correlate the quasiparticles to form composite hadrons in which each valence quasiparticle contributes kinetic energy of the order of a few hundred mev .",
    "this is analogous to the constituent quark model representation of hadrons and therefore it might be possible to further constraint the quark model phenomenology from a first principle , qcd based analysis of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "since the quark model picture calls for a fock space representation it is most natural to consider a canonical , time - independent formulation of qcd .",
    "coulomb gauge qcd offers such a framework  @xcite . in the coulomb gauge",
    "the single particle spectrum contains only physical degrees of freedom , _",
    "i.e. _ two transverse gluon polarizations .",
    "as long as the gauge fields are restricted to the fundamental modular region , with no gribov copies , the hamiltonian is positively defined , it leads to a continuous time evolution , and it is amenable to a variational treatment . finally the coulomb gauge formulation leads to a natural realization of confinement .",
    "this arises because elimination of the non - physical degrees of freedom through the gauge choice , @xmath10 results in an effective , long ranged instantaneous interaction between color charges .",
    "this interaction is the analog of the coulomb potential in qed . in qcd however , the colored coulomb gluons can couple to transverse gluons leading to a coulomb kernel which also depends on the dynamical gluon degrees of freedom . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite summation of the dominant ir contributions to the vacuum expectation value of the coulomb operator results in a potential between color charges which grows linearly at large distances in agreement with lattice calculations  @xcite . in a self - consistent treatment",
    "the same potential modifies the single gluon spectral properties and leads to an effective mass for quasi - gluon excitations @xmath11 , which is also in agreement with recent lattice calculations .",
    "the appearance of the gluon mass gap can be used to justify the implicit assumption of the quark model that mixing between valence quarks and fock space sectors with explicit gluonic excitations is small .",
    "we will return to this point in section iii .",
    "the coulomb gauge formulation provides a very natural starting point for building the constituent representation in accord with confinement and dynamical chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "however , as it was noticed some time ago in the coulomb gauge the simple bcs treatment of the vacuum is not sufficient to generate the right amount of chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "in particular if a pure linear potential is used , @xmath12 with @xmath13 as determined by lattice calculations one typically obtains @xmath14 _ i.e. _ too small by a factor of two  @xcite",
    ". the short range part of the coulomb potential requires proper handling of uv divergences and renormalization and in most recent studies has been ignored .",
    "as will be shown later , it does significantly enhance the condensate and we will argue that the missing contribution can be accounted for by three - particle correlations on top of the bcs - like , particle - hole vacuum .    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we briefly discuss the canonical coulomb gauge formalism and the linked cluster expansion which enables to include multi - particle correlations into the many - body ground state .",
    "we will derive the resulting contributions to the mass gap including up to three - body correlations .",
    "the formalism is suitable for handling both zero and finite density system and in this paper we will focus on the former . in section iii",
    "we discuss the approximations , numerical results and possible sources of uv divergence and their renormalization .",
    "our conclusions and outlook are given in section iv .",

    "when @xmath40 is normal ordered with respect to the perturbative vacuum , @xmath16 one might expect that the mean field , hartee - fock corrections to the single particle energies could already generate an effective mass .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "the vacuum is a color singlet and thus the direct contribution from @xmath40 to a single fermion energy vanishes .",
    "furthermore , chiral symmetry of the hamiltonian and of the perturbative , @xmath41 vacuum protects the exchange term from mass generation .",
    "the effective mass can only be obtained if quark - antiquark correlations are introduced into the ground state as shown schematically in fig .",

    "this expansion is however impractical since it does not differentiate between connected ( linked ) and disconnected contributions .",
    "for example , at the 2-quark-2-antiquark level there are disconnected contributions of the type , @xmath60 , _ i.e. _ part of the @xmath61-particle cluster contribution originates from products of smaller , @xmath62 , @xmath28-particle clusters .",
    "the essence of the linked cluster expansion is based on the observation that all multi - particle correlation in the ground state , including the disconnected ones can be accounted for by proper resummation of the linked clusters only .",
    "this is achieved by writing the full ground state as  @xcite @xmath63 with @xmath64 having the expansion    @xmath65    with the operators @xmath64 including connected pieces only .",

    "since each @xmath71 contains only particle creation operators , the matrix elements of @xmath72 between an @xmath61-particle state and the free vacuum will involve only a finite number of terms arising from the expansion of the exponentials .",
    "for example in a typical case when @xmath73 with @xmath17 being a one body ( _ e.g. _ kinetic ) operator and @xmath74 a two - body potential one has , @xmath75 + \\cdots + { 1\\over { 4!}}[s,[s,[s,[s , h]]]].\\ ] ] in this case an approximation to eq .",

    "the expansion of the coulomb kernel leads to an infinite series of operators to all orders in the transverse gluon field .",
    "thus an approximation to eq .",
    "( [ s1 ] ) consists of specifying which clusters are kept in the definition of @xmath64 and of a truncation scheme in evaluation of matrix elements of @xmath72 .",
    "the truncation of @xmath64 limits the number of quark - antiquark - gluon correlations build into the ansatz for the ground state .",
    "at first one might think that such a truncation would be hard to justify since any hadronic state , including the vacuum should have a large ( infinite ) number of partons .",
    "however , the first two terms in @xmath64 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 change the single particle excitation spectrum and effectively replace the partonic basis by that of massive quasiparticles .",
    "this is known as the thouless reparameterization  @xcite and is equivalent to the bcs ansatz for the vacuum which contains two - body , quark - antiquark and gluon - gluon correlations .",
