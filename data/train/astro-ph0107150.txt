    "observations in the x  ray band provided many evidences for non  gravitational heating of the diffuse , high density baryons in the potential wells of groups and clusters of galaxies ( intra cluster medium , or icm ) .",
    "the first evidence is the shape of the l ",
    "t relation , which is steeper than the self ",
    "similar behaviour @xmath3 predicted in the case of gravitational processes only .",
    "recently , ponman , cannon & navarro ( 1999 , pcn ; see also panel b in figure 1 ) found directly an entropy excess with respect to the level expected from gravitational heating in the center of groups .",
    "the entropy is defined as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the temperature , @xmath7 is the mass density of the ionized plasma , and @xmath8 is the mean molecular weight ( see also balogh , babul & patton 1999 ) .",
    "the excess entropy induces a larger pressure support that decreases the density in the central regions .",
    "this , in turn , rapidly decreases the x  ray luminosity which is proportional to the square of the density .",
    "the effect is stronger in small groups , where the energy responsible for the entropy is comparable to the gravitational one , while clusters , where gravity is dominant , are mostly unaffected .",
    "this produces a steepening of the @xmath9@xmath10 relation .",
    "non  gravitational heating of the icm is expected also on the basis of observations of an average metallicity @xmath11 .",
    "in fact , snae are likely to be responsible of heating and polluting the icm at the same time . for example ,",
    "finoguenov , arnaud & david ( 2000 ) derived about 1 kev per particle from snae from the abundance of silicon . it should be understood how much of this energy goes into the icm and if it is enough to build the observed entropy plateau .",
    "a first step to understand the role of entropy is to investigate its effect on the x  ray properties of groups and clusters of galaxies .",
    "the simplest choice is that of the _ external heating _ models ( or preheating , see tozzi & norman 2001 , hereafter tn ) .",
    "if the excess entropy is present in the baryons before collapse , it will be preserved in the cores of dark matter halos after virialization . in virtue of the extra pressure support , in fact ,",
    "the gas is accreted adiabatically without shock heating .",
    "the entropy has also the effect of suppressing the radiative cooling in the central regions ( due to the low density ) .",
    "the evolution of the adiabat @xmath12 for the accreted shells is shown in figure 1 ( left ) .",
    "collapse entropy @xmath13 is preserved in the core of groups , in agreement with observations ( figure 1 , right ) .",
    "this model allows to trace the evolution of x  ray luminosity and temperature of groups and clusters after assuming a press & schechter  like law for the accretion rate of baryons ( see tn ) . in figure 2",
    "we show that the evolution corresponds to tracks moving along the local @xmath9@xmath10 relation .",
    "thus , a constant @xmath9@xmath10 is predicted up to @xmath14 , in agreement with observations ( mushotzky & scharf 1997 , borgani et al .",
    "the entropy level that satisfies the observations is between @xmath15 erg @xmath16 g@xmath17 ( see figure 1 and 2 ) .    in figure 3",
    "we show surface brightness and temperature profile for a rich cluster and a group in the external entropy scenario ( from tozzi , scharf & norman 2001 , hereafter tsn ) .",
    "the treatment in tsn allows to trace the density profile at radii larger than the virial one , in order to check whether it is possible to detect the infalling gas .",
    "the first case is the most favourable from the point of view of the observations , since the very high external temperature make the infalling gas detectable in emission around rich clusters .",
    "this case is expected if the external gas reached a very high entropy at redshift zero or if it reached large overdensities due to infalling substructures ( see tsn ) . inside the shock radius but outside the adiabatic core",
    ", the entropy profile is well approximated by @xmath18 ( see figure 4 , solid lines ) , a behaviour which is also found in n  body simulations ( see s. borgani , these proceedings ) .",
    "the second case is for a group with a constant external entropy @xmath19 erg @xmath16 g@xmath17 . at this mass scale ,",
    "the external entropy inhibits shock heating and the accretion is entirely adiabatic .",
    "the entropy profile is flat and there is no discontinuity clearly separating the accreted gas from the infalling , external gas . in this case",
    "a substantial temperature gradient is expected in the outer regions .",
    "so far , the temperature profile for groups has been observed only in the very central regions , where no significant gradients are predicted .",
    "the external heating scenario is appealing , but it has a problem : the excess entropy can not be spread uniformly into the cosmic baryons at high redshifts since this would make the ly@xmath0 forest to disappear .",
    "recently , it has been estimated that the level of preheating in the ly@xmath0 clouds is of the order of few @xmath20 ( cen & brian 2001 ) , corresponding to an entropy level more than one order of magnitude lower than that observed in groups .",
    "a possible solution is that only the baryons that end up in the cores of groups and clusters are heated by a biased distribution of sources . such a warm , low density gas would be unobservable at high @xmath1 , and can be detected as ovi absorption systems at low ( tripp , savage & jenkins 2001 ) or at intermediate @xmath1 ( reimers et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "another solution is that the icm is heated after the collapse .",
    "of course , for a given entropy level , the much higher density implies a much higher energy input .",
    "an energy budget of 12 kev per particle seems to be required to reproduce the entropy floor ( see also wu , fabian & nulsen 2000 , valageas & silk 1999 ) and entropy profiles very similar to the ones predicted in the external heating scenario ( see figure 4 , dashed lines ) .",
    "we recall that the preheating scenario requires few tenths of kev ( with a strict lower limit of 0.1 kev , tn ) since the gas is heated at about the background density .",
    "therefore , the internal scenario requires an energy input 310 times higher than that in the external scenario .    despite the snae",
    "can provide a large amount of energy , their efficiency in heating the gas is unknown . in particular , if the heated gas has high density , the thermal energy received from snae is easily radiated away , with a small net increase in the gas entropy .",
    "simulations with a self  consistent snae heating model plugged in , tell us that they can hardly increase the entropy to the observed level in groups and clusters ( see talks by s. borgani ) .",
    "however we still do not have a complete scenario to follow the heating and enrichment by snae and the consequent entropy history of the surrounding baryons .",
    "a recent progress in this direction has been made by pipino et al .",
    "( these proceedings ) .",
    "they computed metals and energy dumped in the icm starting from the observed luminosity function of cluster galaxies .",
    "the efficiency of typeii and typeia snae is computed assuming a spherical gas distribution around galaxies .",
    "the energy per particle dumped in the icm as a function of redshift is plotted in figure 5 ( black stripe ) .",
    "we also plotted the energy required to obtain the entropy @xmath15 erg @xmath16 g@xmath17 at a given redshift in virialized structures ( upper stripe ) and in the background baryons ( lower stripe ) .",
    "it turns out that snae can contribute a substantial amount of the required energy . to understand in detail their role in the entropy history of the icm",
    ", we must run detailed hydrodynamical simulations ( see talks by r. bower and a. ferrara ) to follow the heating along with the accretion of the diffuse baryons and the cooling of the low entropy gas .",
    "if snae will be shown to be unadequate for this job , it will be necessary to look for other sources , like agns , which in principle can provide the largest amount of energies ( but see yamada & fujita 2001 ) .",
    "both x  ray observations and theoretical modelling will be crucial in the next few years .",
