    "one of the features of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics is the universality of the lepton couplings , i.e. the fact that the coupling of the @xmath5 to the leptons does not depend on their flavor .",
    "however the experimental results from lep - ii on this issue @xcite showed a slight deviation from universality coming from the third family , giving @xcite : @xmath6 resulting in @xmath7 standard deviations colliders data .",
    "it is worth mentioning that considering only lep2 data the discrepancy grows to 2.8 @xmath8 @xcite ( 2.6 @xmath8 using only published data @xcite ) , all correlations included . ]",
    "( all correlations included ) from the sm prediction @xmath9 @xcite , which uncertainty is negligible compared with the experimental error . recalling also the following ratio : @xmath10 and the correspondent sm prediction @xmath11 , it can be concluded that the two lightest families seem to attach to the universality principle .",
    "the confirmation or refutation of this measurement is obviously very important , since such a violation by the third family would be a clear indication of new physics ( np ) @xcite .",
    "however , it will not be easy for the lhc to reach such a precision in this observable , given the theoretical uncertainties associated to a hadronic machine .",
    "for this reason it is interesting to check indirectly this anomaly through its interplay with other related measurements .",
    "precision electroweak observables ( ewpo ) , as well as other precise low energy measurements , provide constraints on new models looking for deviations that could foresee the np structure .",
    "we study in this article if it is possible to accommodate the apparent discrepancy on the @xmath12 channel within the present situation provided by ewpo , where essentially no disagreements have been found .",
    "in particular , lepton universality has been tested successfully at the per - mil level in @xmath13 @xcite and @xmath14 decays ( see e.g. table 3 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , what makes very challenging to find a np explanation for the large anomaly shown in eq .  . just for the sake of illustration ,",
    "we show the values obtained in leptonic z decays @xcite : @xmath15 in good agreement with the sm predictions , @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively .",
    "instead of adhering to a specific model we will follow an effective field theory approach , where np is parameterized by a tower of higher - dimensional operators  @xcite .",
    "all np theories which spectrum does not contain new light mass physical states ( in comparison to those of the sm ) , that are weakly coupled at the electroweak scale and invariant under the sm gauge symmetries reduce at lower energies to the same effective lagrangian , feature that makes this eft approach very appealing .",
    "guided by the above - mentioned experimental data on lepton universality , we will consider different frameworks where the new physics does not affect operators involving first and second generation fermions .",
    "as we will explain , this can be implemented through the adoption of specific flavor symmetries .    for the numerical analysis",
    ", we greatly benefit from ref .",
    "@xcite , where constraints on these effective operators were obtained via a global fit to precision electroweak data .",
    "we modify the associated fitting code to introduce additional observables and operators .",
    "these fit procedures are a powerful tool to analyze the impact of current constraints on different models .",
    "we apply this method to study the possible np effects in leptonic w decays allowed by electroweak precision data . we will emphasize the role that the leptonic tau decay and the exclusive channel @xmath18 play in constraining specific directions of the parameter space of our theory , and the need to include these observables in this kind of analyses .",
    "we will see that the observed departure from universality can not be accommodated within the current experimental scenario under quite general assumptions .",
    "thus in order to be able to explain the observed deviation from lepton universality as a genuine np effect , it seems to be necessary to resort to a different description of np that could involve the introduction of new light degrees of freedom or a strongly interacting sector .",
    "a closely related issue driven by the @xmath19 vertex is the ratio of widths involving the leptonic decays of pseudoscalar heavy mesons , @xmath20 .",
    "accordingly , if any violation of universality is at work it also should be exposed in ratios of these decays into different charged leptons .",
    "similarly , any modification of the sm coupling of @xmath21 with the tau lepton could show up , due to gauge symmetry , in the anomalous magnetic moment of the tau .",
    "we will comment how our results translate into these subjects .    in the next section the eft framework",
    "is introduced , along with different flavor symmetries and the relevant effective operators . in sec .",
    "[ sec : wtaunu ] we identify the operators that can generate a lepton universality violation in the third family , whereas in sec .  [ sec : fit ] we analyze through a global fit the bounds on these operators from ewpo and other low - energy measurements . sec .",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] contains our conclusions .",
    "an appendix collects several theoretical expressions not included in the main text .",
    "effective field theories embody the features , and particularly the dynamics , of the underlying theory .",
    "the astonishing performance of the sm suggests that whatever theory we find at higher energies has to reduce , upon integration of the relevant heavier degrees of freedom , to the key properties of the sm : symmetries and fields , that become its eft .",
    "it is clear , though , that this approach breaks down if the underlying new physics contains physical states with mass @xmath22 , possibility that we do not consider in the present analysis . in this case",
    "the appropriate eft should include that spectrum and its dynamics . in order to properly define our eft",
    "setting we need moreover to assume that the new theory above the sm is weakly coupled at the weak scale , so that the gauge @xmath23 symmetry is linearly realized .",
    "the trail left in the procedure of integrating out heavier degrees of freedom is a lagrangian with higher dimensional operators that respect its symmetry and content @xcite : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the sm lagrangian , @xmath26 is the np energy scale and @xmath27 are @xmath23 gauge - invariant operators of dimension @xmath28 built with sm fields ( including the standard higgs boson ) .",
    "finally @xmath29 are the dimensionless wilson coefficients that carry the information of the underlying dynamics at the @xmath26 scale and are expected to be of @xmath30 .",
    "the only gauge - invariant operator of dimension five violates lepton number , and thus it can be safely neglected under the assumption that the violation of that symmetry occurs at scales much higher than @xmath31 tev . then the first order corrections to the sm predictions come from dimension - six operators .",
    "the contribution from these operators involve terms proportional to @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 gev is the vacuum expectation value of the higgs field and e is the energy scale of the process considered . in order to be consistent with the truncation of the effective lagrangian ( [ eq : left ] ) we work at linear order in the above ratios , i.e. keeping only the contributions coming from the interference of the sm and dimension - six operators .",
    "in this article we consider the study of the apparent violation of universality in the couplings of w to leptons within the above eft framework , with the goal of finding out if the observed deviation can be explained in terms of np effects once constraints from precise electroweak observables are taken into account .",
    "motivated by the data and for the sake of simplicity , we will assume two different flavor symmetries that we introduce in the next subsections .    to set the stage for this discussion , we explain first the simpler case of @xmath36 flavor symmetry . in the absence of yukawa couplings ,",
    "the sm lagrangian shows a @xmath37 flavor symmetry , corresponding to the independent rotation of each sm fermion field : the quark and lepton doublets @xmath38 and @xmath39 and the up - quark , down - quark and charged lepton singlets @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "we can also decompose this symmetry group in the following way : @xmath43 where the five global @xmath44 symmetries can be identified with the total lepton and baryon number , the hypercharge , the peccei - quinn symmetry and a remaining global symmetry that we choose to be the rotation of the charged lepton singlet . in the presence of yukawa couplings this flavor symmetry breaks down to the subgroup @xmath45 .",
    "requiring that the higher dimensional operators respect the @xmath36 flavor symmetry reduces significantly their number , suppresses undesired flavor changing neutral current effects and leads to the minimal flavor violation ( mfv ) framework after the introduction of the yukawa spurions @xcite",

    "@xcite : @xmath47 is the higgs boson doublet ; @xmath48 are the pauli matrices ; @xmath49 , @xmath50 and the covariant derivative reads @xmath51 , with hypercharge @xmath52 .",
    "it is clear that in this special framework it is impossible to generate any departure from lepton universality , as the @xmath36 symmetry allows only for flavor independent np contributions .",
    "for this reason we will relax this symmetry group to smaller groups where the third family is singled out .",
    "motivated by the experimental observations shown in eqs .   and , it is an interesting possibility to assume the flavor symmetry @xmath1 ^ 5 $ ] , that singularizes the third family with respect to the light ones , allowing for different np contribution to the processes involving the heavy fermions : top , bottom and , in particular , @xmath0 and @xmath53 .",
    "this framework was indeed studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we will use the same notation , in which @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) represent only the two first generations of fermions , whereas @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath0 represent the third family fields .",
    "the new notation makes clear which combinations of flavor indices are allowed by the flavor symmetry .",
    "the operators that do not involve fermions are the same as in the @xmath36 case , whereas those involving one or two fermion bilinears split in several operators ; for instance : @xmath64 the list of invariant operators is much longer than in the @xmath36 symmetric case , but not all the operators affect the ewpo .",

    "for the sake of simplicity we will assume that 2- and 4-fermion operators that only have light generation fermions can be neglected .",
    "in this way we are left with the following six operators with one fermion bilinear : @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we also have the following four - fermion operators @xcite : @xmath70      in the limit of vanishing yukawa couplings the sm lagrangian is invariant under the @xmath1 ^ 5 $ ] group symmetry considered in the previous section .",
    "we can work with a more realistic scenario keeping the third family yukawas @xmath71 and neglecting only those of the two lightest generations . in this case",
    "the flavor symmetry breaks down to @xmath72 , that we will just call @xmath2 , since the three @xmath44 subgroups are simply the lepton and baryon number and hypercharge of the third generation , suitably broken by spurions  la mfv , can be found in ref .",

    "given that we focus here on the @xmath75 decay we will not consider in the following the operators @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",

    "we will consider the universality ratios @xmath93 , instead of the simple decay rate , in such a way that we do not have to worry about the np corrections associated to the experimental determination of the fermi constant @xmath84 , since they cancel in the ratio .",

    "as expected , it is not possible to do such a thing with just one effective operator at play , due mainly to the very precise @xmath141 and @xmath0 leptonic decays , as nicely shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : singleoperator ] .",
    "more surprisingly we have found that ewpo are such strong constraints that not even in a global analysis where all the operators affecting the third family are present one can accommodate the @xmath176 anomaly .",
    "should this departure from universality be confirmed by new data , then our analysis disfavor the possibility of explaining it through a weakly coupled theory standing at the tev scale , unless a quite non - trivial flavor structure occurs .",
    "instead , it would be necessary to resort to a different description of np that could involve the introduction of new light degrees of freedom or a strongly interacting sector with flavor dependent couplings to leptons . for example",
    "previous studies of this deviation from universality in @xmath21 decays have focused on the possibility that pair production of supersymmetric light charged higgs bosons , almost degenerate with the @xmath21 and decaying largely into heavy fermions , could mimic @xmath75 decays @xcite .",
    "modifications on the electroweak gauge group in order to singularize the third family have also been considered @xcite .",
    "last but not least we have shown the importance of the current measurements in leptonic and semileptonic @xmath0 decays as new physics constraining observables that probe new directions in the parameter space of our eft framework , and we have analyzed the sensitivity of the leptonic decays of pseudoscalar mesons to the the violations of lepton universality .",
