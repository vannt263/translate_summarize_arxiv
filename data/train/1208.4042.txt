    "nowadays , ranking techniques and reputation systems are widely employed in e - commerce services , where buyers and sellers may give each other a score after a completed transaction  encouraging good behavior in the long term  @xcite .",
    "other reputation systems are content - based , in the sense that users are evaluated by their contribution  @xcite . in the field of search engines , pagerank  @xcite ,",
    "the most successful algorithm for ranking web pages , is basically a random walk process on the directed graphs of websites and hyperlinks .",
    "hits ( hyperlink - induced topic search  @xcite ) , a predecessor of pagerank , instead assigns to web pages two different scores : as hub and as authority .",
    "thanks to this twofold nature of the score , hits was later generalized  @xcite to bipartite graphs , an important class of systems where entities are divided in two disjoint sets such that interactions happen only between entities in different sets .",
    "examples of systems modeled by bipartite graphs include reviewers and movies in rental websites , scientists and papers in citation networks , customers and products in e - commerce services , and so on . in these systems ,",
    "each set is endowed with only one kind of score , and if the two sets consist of users and objects it is natural to associate these scores with reputation and quality , respectively .",
    "however , bipartite networks are often embedded in the social network of the participant users : for instance , in websites like digg.com or last.fm , users can select other users as their friends ; also , citation networks are naturally influenced by the professional relationships among scientists .",
    "the underlying social network represent an additional source of information a ranking algorithm may exploit , as social links can be associated with trust relationships among users .",
    "this is similar to recently proposed recommendation techniques that make use of social ties to obtain recommendations  @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we propose a novel and generalized ranking algorithm for bipartite systems to assign quality values to objects and reputation values to users .",
    "such method , which we name qtr ( quality , trust and reputation ) , also exploits the information coming from the users social relationships .",
    "qtr is a generalized algorithm in the sense that it can be easily adapted to different situations ( e.g. by giving more weight to certain kind of actions , or to a particular behavior of users ) .",
    "we test our method on two different datasets , the econophysics forum online community and the last.fm online radio and social network , which are particularly suited for our generalized algorithm  as will be explained later .",
    "the results of our study are twofold .",
    "we first confirm that ranking is a difficult task , and that an improper algorithm or a peculiarly - structured dataset can lead to extremely biased results .",
    "hence we propose a form of the qtr which is efficient in avoiding such bias .",
    "in addition , we show that social relationships can play a valuable role in improving the quality of the ranking .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  2 presents the qtr ranking method , including its relation with hits .",
    "section  3 reports the description of each dataset used for testing , followed by the results of our analysis .",
    "we conclude with possible generalizations of the qtr algorithm in section  4 .",
    "before presenting our ranking method , we describe the underlying bipartite system and introduce some notations .",
    "a bipartite network consists of two disjoint sets of entities ( nodes ) , which for convenience we name as users ( labeled by latin letters , @xmath0 ) and objects ( labeled by greek letters , @xmath1 ) .",
    "an interaction between user @xmath2 and object @xmath3 is represented by a link connecting the two . using the formalism of the adjacency matrix",
    ", we say that @xmath4 equals 1 if an interaction has occurred , and 0 otherwise .",
    "more generally , such interaction can be represented by a weighted link @xmath5 , where the strength of the link depends on which particular interaction has occurred or how important / demanding that interaction was .",
    "we can further define the degree of user @xmath2 as the number of objects that user has interacted with : @xmath6 , and the degree of object @xmath3 as the number of users who interacted with it : @xmath7 .",
    "the total weight of user @xmath2 is instead defined as @xmath8 , and of object @xmath3 as @xmath9 .    aside from the bipartite network , users interact with each other in a monopartite social network , where we say that the adjacency matrix element @xmath10 equals 1 if user @xmath2 is a friend of user @xmath11 or trusts user @xmath11 ( note that in the first case the matrix is symmetric , whereas it is not in the second ) . as before , we can introduce a weighted link @xmath12 which represents the `` amount of trust '' user @xmath2 puts in user @xmath11 .",
    "the number of friends of / users who trust user @xmath11 is @xmath13 , whereas the total weight of user @xmath11 is @xmath14 .",
    "we shall now define the meaning of the ranking scores the algorithm assigns to objects and users : quality and reputation , respectively .",
    "_ quality _ it is not an inherent property of an object , rather it is constructed through interactions of the community with the object itself .",
    "_ reputation _ represents the general opinion of the community towards a user , hence it is ascribed by others and assessed on the basis of the user s actions .",
    "we use these conceptual definitions to write down the equations for the qtr ranking method : @xmath15 \\label{q_a}\\\\ r_i&=&\\frac{1}{k_i^{\\theta_r}}\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^m w_{i\\alpha}[q_{\\alpha}-\\rho_q\\bar{q}]+\\frac{1}{f_i^{\\theta_t}}\\sum_{j=1}^m[r_j-\\rho_r\\bar{r}][t_{ji}-\\rho_t\\bar{t } ] \\label{r_i}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 $ ] are the average values of quality , reputation and trust in the community , and @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 are control parameters  all varying in the range @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "since equations ( [ q_a ] ) and ( [ r_i ] ) are mutually interconnected , quality and reputation values can be determined iteratively . starting with evenly distributed scores @xmath26 @xmath27 , @xmath28 @xmath29 , values of quality and reputation at iteration step @xmath30",
    "are computed from the values at the previous step @xmath31 by : @xmath32 \\nonumber\\\\ r_i^{(n+1)}&\\leftarrow&\\frac{1}{k_i^{\\theta_r}}\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^m w_{i\\alpha}[q_{\\alpha}^{(n)}-\\rho_q\\bar{q}^{(n)}]+\\frac{1}{f_i^{\\theta_t}}\\sum_{j=1}^m[r_j^{(n)}-\\rho_r\\bar{r}^{(n)}][t_{ji}-\\rho_t\\bar{t } ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to avoid divergence , normalization is applied at the end of each step so that : @xmath33 ^ 2=1 \\qquad\\qquad \\sum_{i=1}^n [ r_i^{(n+1)}]^2=1\\ ] ] the iterative procedure stops when the algorithm converges to a stationary state : @xmath34    the qtr algorithm just introduced is a generalization of the notorious hits algorithm for bipartite graphs @xcite , namely : @xmath35 qtr reduces to standard hits when all parameters @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 go to zero and @xmath36 @xmath37 .",
    "however we shall see in what follows that , although making analytical treatment hard , these parameters are extremely valuable in controlling the outcome of the ranking , and that trust represents additional information which is worth to consider .",
    "in this section we test the qtr algorithm on two different datasets , the econophysics forum community and the last.fm online radio and social network .",
    "we present the rankings obtained for objects and users for different values of the model parameters . in order to better describe our results",
    ", we make use of pearson correlation coefficients between various pairs of quantities : @xmath38@xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) , @xmath38@xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) , @xmath43@xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) , @xmath43@xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) , and only for last.fm @xmath43@xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the econophysics forum ( http://unifr.ch/econophysics/ ) is an online platform for interdisciplinary collaboration between physicists and social scientists .",
    "users of the forum can share different resources related to econophysics and complexity science . in what follows",
    ", we will consider as objects only the papers uploaded to the forum . as a consequence ,",
    "a user action can be either uploading , downloading , or viewing a paper . to obtain the dataset of interactions",
    ", we analyzed the forum s weblogs dating from 6th july 2010 until 1st june 2012 .",
    "we removed all entries corresponding to web bots ( which cause approximately 75% of the traffic ) and repeated access ( a user viewing / downloading the same paper several times ) .",
    "we also removed all papers uploaded before 6th july 2010 ( for which we do not know the uploader ) and all actions associated with them .",
    "finally , we removed the users who both did not upload any paper and have only one view or download action . altogether , our refined data contains 3511 users , 597 papers and 19578 links .    among the three types of users access considered ( uploading , downloading and viewing a paper ) ,",
    "the first is obviously the more demanding , whereas the second reflects the user s interest in the paper much better than the latter .",
    "hence we can associate to each action a different weight .",
    "in what follows , we set @xmath50 for upload actions , @xmath51 for download actions and @xmath52 for view actions .",
    "of course this is just a particular choice , which we consider as reasonable , and we are going to investigate different weighting system in future works .",
    "we are also currently running an online survey to determine how these different actions are perceived by scientists  this will allow for a more justified choice of the weights . in any case , the freedom to chose the particular set of weights is what makes the econophysics dataset an ideal candidate for testing qtr , despite it does not contain information about users social or trust relationships .",
    ".[ep_ag ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in this section we discuss two further generalizations of the qtr algorithm , which will be studied and tested in future works .",
    "bipartite systems and their related social networks are not static but instead evolve in time .",
    "this means that new users can join the community , whereas other users who are already members may become inactive after a while . on the other hand",
    ", newly appeared objects can become hits in almost no time , whereas old objects usually end up losing their attractiveness .",
    "because of these features , a ranking algorithm should be able to handle time effects , for instance by avoiding giving high score to objects which were very popular in the past but whose relevance is currently negligible , or by giving low scores to users who were reliable in the past but then started to behave badly .",
    "we can hence introduce in the equations a decaying function of time @xmath53 : @xmath54d(\\tau_{i\\alpha } ) \\label{q_a_dec}\\\\ r_i(t)&=&\\varepsilon+\\frac{1}{k_i(t)^{\\theta_r}}\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^m w_{i\\alpha}[q_{\\alpha}(t)-\\rho_q\\bar{q}(t)]d(\\tau_{i\\alpha})\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{f_i(t)^{\\theta_t}}\\sum_{j=1}^m[r_j(t)-\\rho_r\\bar{r}(t)][t_{ji}(t)-\\rho_t\\bar{t}(t)]d(\\tau_{ij } ) \\label{r_i_dec}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the current time , @xmath56 is the age of the interaction of user @xmath2 and object @xmath3 , @xmath57 is the age of the trust relationship between users @xmath2 and @xmath11 , and @xmath58 is the small positive reputation assigned to new members of the community ( who do not have any interaction yet ) .",
    "the decay function @xmath59 can have non - zero tail even when @xmath55 is large , and the strength of the decay can be tuned to focus on a particular time window .",
    "some examples of decay function include @xmath60^{-1}$ ] or @xmath61 $ ] , where @xmath62 is the characteristic time scale of decay .",
    "_ trust _ is the subjective opinion of one user towards another .",
    "we argue that , when no explicit assessments from users are available , trust relationships can be inferred form the bipartite network by measuring the similarity of users actions , which essentially means by projecting the bipartite user - object network into the monopartite user - user network : @xmath63}{k_j(t)^{\\theta_r}}\\sum_{\\alpha=1}^m w_{i\\alpha}w_{j\\alpha}\\frac{[q_{\\alpha}(t)-\\rho_q\\bar{q}(t)]}{k_\\alpha(t)^{\\theta_q}}d(\\tau_{i\\alpha})d(\\tau_{j\\alpha})\\ ] ] we name this term as `` projected '' trust . despite the fact that projected trust values are computed with the same source of information used for quality and reputation assessment , preliminary results ( not reported here ) show that using @xmath64 instead of @xmath65 values in a slightly modified version of the algorithm can bring to some improvements with respect to simple hits , especially when the bipartite network is sparse .",
    "in this work we introduced a general ranking method for bipartite networks that can simultaneously evaluate users reputation and objects quality .",
    "this is by no means the first attempt in the literature  @xcite , however our method differs from the others by exploiting the trust relationships and social acquaintances of users as an additional source of information .",
    "testing of our method on real datasets revealed which form of the algorithm gives more reasonable results .",
    "in addition , we showed that considering trust relationships indeed brings improvements to the resultant ranking .",
    "the positive results we obtained are encouraging .",
    "however , the number of parameters used by the algorithm , and in general the difficulties in assessing the reliability of a ranking method pose additional issues on the effectiveness of our method , which will require further tests and future studies .",
