    "the first quasars were discovered in radio surveys once it became possible to confidently associate radio sources with optical counterparts that had unusual colors @xcite . subsequently it was found that quasars could be readily identified on the basis of their optical emission alone @xcite , as their roughly power - law spectral energy distributions were easily distinguishable from stellar blackbody emission .",
    "optical surveys have since dominated quasar discoveries , while the minority radio population has been used to find highly reddened quasars @xcite and scarce , high - redshift quasars @xcite . in both cases",
    "the use of radio data enables searches in regions of color space which are problematic for optical selection alone .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has assembled the largest collection of quasars to date ; the dr5 catalog includes nearly 80,000 quasars found over 8000 deg@xmath3 @xcite . before sdss , only @xmath4 quasars were known at @xmath5 , and none at @xmath6 . by targeting roughly @xmath7 objects for spectroscopic follow - up as candidate quasars , the sdss has been able to uncover even the rarest sources , including @xmath8 luminous quasars at @xmath6 .",
    "historically , low - redshift quasars were often identified by their ultraviolet - excess relative to stars , and were thus selected from somewhat restricted regions of color space .",
    "one of the great advances of the sdss was to select essentially all objects with stellar morphologies but non - stellar colors as quasar targets , allowing for a variety of quasars to be discovered over a wide range of redshifts , including objects with highly unusual colors ( e.g. , balqsos , * ? ? ? * ) . however , quasar colors are not always different from those of stars .",
    "this is especially problematic at high redshift ( @xmath9 ) , where quasar colors blend with the stellar distribution . whether or not a given quasar is selected by the sdss depends on its flux , redshift and intrinsic color ; thus the selection function can be somewhat difficult to characterize , even if target determination is rather simple",
    "the sheer yield of quasars from the sdss demonstrates that the targeting algorithms are highly effective .",
    "the completeness of the sdss quasar survey has been studied in detail by @xcite and ( * ? ? ? * hereafter r06 ) .",
    "the former obtained spectra of @xmath1020,000 stellar objects from 278 deg@xmath3 of sdss imaging data and found that only 10 were quasars missed by sdss targeting .",
    "the latter used simulated quasar photometry , assuming a gaussian distribution of power - law quasar spectral energy distributions ( seds ) centered on a typical spectral index of @xmath11 , to estimate the completeness of the observed quasar distribution with respect to color , luminosity , and redshift .",
    "both studies were most effective at low redshift ( @xmath12 ) due to the relative scarcity of more distant quasars .",
    "the sdss also considers stellar counterparts to radio sources from the faint images of the radio sky at twenty - centimeters survey ( first , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as primary targets .",
    "radio selection of quasar candidates is limited in the sense that radio - bright quasars constitute only @xmath13 of the total population , and objects selected by radio emission may not be representative of the population as a whole . on the other hand , radio selection avoids many of the problems inherent in color selection , as stars do not contribute significantly to the mjy radio population and are thus easily eliminated from radio samples without regard to color . in this way , radio selection can be used to test the completeness of optical selection .    the apparent connection between black hole growth and galaxy evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) underscores the need to understand the evolution of the quasar population over cosmic time .",
    "evolutionary trends in the quasar population are often characterized through luminosity functions , which require a well - understood selection function .",
    "the comoving number density of quasars has long been known to evolve strongly with redshift , peaking at @xmath14 and declining rapidly at higher redshifts .",
    "a sample of @xmath15 quasars from the palomar transit grism survey @xcite yielded a flatter slope for the high-@xmath16 quasar luminosity function than that derived for low - redshift quasars . the much larger sample of color - selected quasars from the sdss showed a similar change in the bright - end slope , suggesting an evolution not just in the number density but also the luminosity distribution of high - redshift quasars @xcite .",
    "however , there are relatively few probes of the luminous high-@xmath16 quasar population available for comparison .    in this work",
    "we examine the completeness of sdss quasar selection at @xmath0 by identifying quasar candidates drawn from the combined first and sdss data .",
    "we define a sample of high-@xmath16 quasar candidates through a simple color cut which selects red sdss counterparts to first sources .",
    "this allows us to explore a wide swath of color space with minimal bias in the optical colors of high - redshift quasars .",
    "we achieve a relatively high efficiency of discovery by requiring small offsets between the radio and optical positions , practically eliminating stars from our sample .",
    "our observations fill in gaps in the sdss quasar selection by targeting fainter counterparts to radio sources .",
    "we begin by summarizing the methods for targeting quasar candidates adopted by the sdss .",
    "we describe our selection criteria in   [ sec : samplesel ] and compare the efficiencies of various selection methods . in   [ sec : observations ] we present spectroscopy for 45 of our candidates , including many new quasars .",
    "we place our sample in a broader context in   [ sec : discussion ] by including results from other surveys , following which we discuss a population of moderately - reddened quasars at low redshift found primarily through radio selection , and calculate a luminosity function for radio - loud quasars at @xmath2 .",
    "finally , we present some brief conclusions and prospects for future surveys .",
    "we adopt a standard cosmology of @xmath17 .",
    "as our quasar sample is drawn from the sdss , we provide a brief review of the algorithms used by sdss to target quasars for spectroscopy before discussing our method for selecting high - redshift quasars . for a complete description of sdss quasar selection ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the sdss has two primary criteria for targeting quasars .",
    "the first is color selection , with separate criteria for low- and high - redshift targets .",
    "the algorithm used to target quasars at @xmath18 is referred to as qso_target_hiz . briefly , stellar sources with @xmath19 are targeted when they are far from the stellar locus in @xmath20 color space , or if they are within inclusion regions ( and outside exclusion regions ) used to target quasars at specific redshifts .",
    "this leads to a strongly redshift - dependent completeness at high redshift , as quasar colors move in and out of the stellar locus ( r06 ) . for brevity",
    ", we will refer to the qso_target_hiz algorithm as qso_hiz .",
    "the second criterion is based on matching stellar sdss sources to first radio sources ; all sources having @xmath21 and a first match within @xmath22 are selected for spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "targets selected in this manner have the flag qso_first . first selection allows quasar candidates that fall within the stellar locus or are otherwise missed by color selection to be targeted .",
    "however , the brighter magnitude limit adopted for qso_first selection means that few high-@xmath16 quasars are identified outside of the qso_hiz algorithm ",
    "only @xmath23 of @xmath24 quasars in dr5qso have @xmath25 , and only 1 in 10 were targeted outside of qso_hiz .",
    "objects from the sdss photometric database are rejected as quasar candidates if they have the fatal errors bright , saturated , edge , or blended .",
    "the first three flags occur for bright objects , bleed trails of bright stars , and objects near the edge of imaging frames .",
    "the deblending algorithm separates blended sources into one or more children , each of which is assigned the child flag and is considered by the quasar targeting algorithm .",
    "a primary object with the blended flag indicates that the attempt to deblend was unsuccessful , and thus the object s photometry is unreliable .",

    "our survey is designed to identify @xmath0 radio - loud quasars efficiently with a high level of completeness and minimal bias in optical color .",
    "stars are the principal contaminant in optical quasar surveys and must be eliminated to achieve high efficiency . as noted in ",
    "[ sec : sdss_sel ] , sdss uses a @xmath22 radius to match with first .",
    "this results in a high degree of completeness with respect to radio - optical associations , as very few radio quasars have offsets between the optical and radio positions greater than this value .",
    "in fact , due to the excellent astrometry of the two surveys , the peak of the optical / radio offsets occurs at about @xmath27 ( * ? ? ? * figure 9a ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the number of stars in the sdss is so large that using a @xmath22 radius to identify radio quasar candidates results in significant stellar contamination . of the quasar candidates targeted by sdss using first - only criteria ( i.e. , having the qso_first target flag set but no optical selection flags )",
    ", only 40% are quasars , while over half are stars .",
    "this is not due to a large population of stars with mjy radio emission ; rather , the stars are clearly offset from the radio positions with a distribution consistent with chance coincidence .",
    "recent work with the sdss has shown that the number of radio - emitting stars detected by first at faint optical magnitudes is exceedingly small @xcite .",
    "sub - arcsecond matching of first and sdss sources greatly increases the yield of quasars relative to stars , but does introduce bias against sources near the first detection limit , where the astrometric uncertainties are greater .",
    "in addition , for quasars with extended radio counterparts , the fitted radio centroid may not correspond directly to the optical position .",
    "we find that using a @xmath28 matching radius is @xmath29 complete to quasars with @xmath30  mjy ; this will be discussed in more detail in  [ sec : discuss_lf_offsets ] .",
    "the strict matching described above allows us to eliminate stars without resorting to color selection techniques , freeing us to select quasars independently of their optical properties .",
    "however , if we blindly selected optical counterparts to radio sources , we would be overwhelmed by low-@xmath16 quasars . to reach the desired population at @xmath0 , we take advantage of lyman-@xmath31 forest absorption , which reddens all high-@xmath16 quasars irrespective of their intrinsic spectral energy distribution . in particular",
    ", we expect the ultraviolet to blue wavelength range ( the @xmath32 and @xmath33 bands in sdss ) to be strongly absorbed for @xmath0 quasars , and thus colors in these bands can be used to reduce low-@xmath16 quasar contamination without introducing much bias at high redshift .",
    "a thorough discussion of the changes in quasar colors with redshift in the sdss photometric system can be found in @xcite . in that work",
    "it is noted that at @xmath34 , little or no flux is expected in the @xmath32-band , while at @xmath0 , the @xmath35 color reddens as the ly@xmath31 forest is in the @xmath33-band .",
    "we base our selection on the combination of a red @xmath26 color cut with sub - arcsecond matching of radio and optical positions . in order to expand on sdss selection",

    "we then reject objects with the fatal photometric errors bright , saturated , and edge , as well as those not having the flag ok_scanline set @xcite .",
    "this reduces the sample to 1536 candidate quasars . of the 2484 quasars in dr5qso with @xmath0",
    ", only two do not meet our selection criteria ( ignoring the first match requirement ) .",
    "both are luminous ( @xmath41 ) quasars at @xmath42 , and are missed because they are unusually bright in the @xmath32 band ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) .",
    "thus we expect that our color criteria are highly complete for @xmath0 quasars .",
    "we chose to keep blended objects after noticing that some of the previously identified @xmath0 quasars in our sample were flagged blended .",
    "visual examination of the 76 blended objects in our candidate sample showed that nearly all of them are isolated objects .",

    "this weighting is based on the optical flux distribution of the quasars , and not their luminosities .",
    "an alternative method for determining the completeness is to assume an _ a priori _ distribution in color and absolute magnitude as a function of redshift and then compare to the observed distribution , as was done by r06 .",

    "the best - fit slope is slightly flatter , with @xmath150 , compared to @xmath151 as derived by r06 from sdss data ( see their figure 21 ) .",
    "the agreement between the shapes of the luminosity functions provides some corroboration for the assertion that the bright - end slope of the qlf flattens at high redshift ( compared to @xmath152 at @xmath89 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that the fraction of radio - loud quasars ( with @xmath129 ) declines with both redshift and optical luminosity @xcite .",
    "such an effect might account for the relatively low radio - loud fraction of @xmath48 derived by comparing the space densities of radio - loud quasars to the optical population ( table  [ tbl : rlphi ] ) , as well as the somewhat flatter slope  a decline of the radio - loud fraction with optical luminosity would tend to flatten the rlqlf .",
    "however , we note that our sample is restricted to radio - loud quasars with @xmath153 and thus underrepresents the radio - loud fraction according to the threshold usually adopted , which would include objects with @xmath154 .",
    "further , @xcite found that the radio - loud fraction depends on optical luminosity as @xmath155 , implying that @xmath156 , which is a greater difference between the two slopes than we find . a larger sample of high-@xmath16 quasars with radio coverage deeper than that of first is needed to better address this question .",

    "we have assembled a sample of @xmath0 radio quasar candidates using a simple color cut , and shown that precise matching of the radio and optical positions leads to a high rate of discovery .",
    "we have identified 29 quasars , 26 of which are published for the first time , with 7 at @xmath0 and the highest redshift source at @xmath66 .",
    "the sdss does an excellent job of identifying quasars at a wide range of redshifts , and @xmath107 of @xmath0 quasars in our radio - selected quasar sample were targeted by the color selection algorithms of sdss .",
    "however , it achieves a high degree of completeness at the expense of efficiency , with the primary algorithm used to target high-@xmath16 quasars having a 50% stellar contamination rate .",
    "we have shown that radio selection , when optimized to the astrometric precisions of the parent surveys and combined with simple , relatively unbiased color selection , can identify high - redshift quasars with high efficiency .",
    "our particular criteria were used to target quasars at @xmath0 and are 20% efficient at those redshifts .",
    "applying red color selection criteria yields two types of objects : low - redshift , moderately reddened quasars largely missed by optical selection , and high - redshift quasars similar to those found in optical surveys .",
    "we used our radio - selected sample of @xmath0 quasars to derive a completeness for sdss selection at high redshift , and found the completeness to be high ( @xmath107 ) and in good agreement with previous results .",
    "we further use the sample to derive a radio - loud quasar luminosity function at @xmath2 , and again find good agreement with sdss results .",
    "more sophisticated quasar selection methods , such as the automated neural networks employed by @xcite , can achieve even higher efficiencies ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "this potentially comes at the expense of completeness , and the selection function can be difficult to quantify .",
    "in addition , these methods require a training set of known objects , meaning that the candidates identified by the algorithm will generally have similar properties to the input objects , and are subject to any limitations inherent to that sample .",
    "broad criteria such as ours are much less efficient , but better suited for constructing complete samples .",
    "we have employed radio selection in order to expand on color selection techniques .",
    "currently planned synoptic surveys such as pan - starrs and lsst will be able to distinguish quasars from stars through optical variability and ( lack of ) proper motion , and thus find quasars independent of their optical colors .",
    "the lsst design will allow detection of quasars to the formal luminosity cutoff ( @xmath157 ) to @xmath158 without using color selection @xcite .",
    "moderately reddened quasars similar to those presented here will fall within reach of this survey .",
    "however , for some heavily - extincted quasars the nucleus may be sufficiently obscured such that any variability would pass unnoticed , or worse , the observed flux would fall below the survey detection limit .",
    "these quasars can be found through infrared - excess selection ( irx , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is relatively insensitive to reddening , using a new generation of infrared surveys much deeper than 2mass ( e.g. , ukidss , viking , vhs ; for an example with ukidss see @xcite ) .",
    "these surveys will better address the connection between radio luminosity and optical color by having sensitivity to red quasars without requiring radio detection for selection .",
    "finally , first only detects the most radio - loud quasars at high - redshift ; future surveys with the greatly enhanced sensitivity of the evla will push deeper into the radio - loud quasar luminosity function at high-@xmath16 .",
