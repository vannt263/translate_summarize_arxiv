    "increasingly , data are being generated in the form of networks , where interactions among objects are the focus of study .",
    "social networks are perhaps the most prototypical example which consist of people ( nodes ) and their associations ( edges ) . finding structure in complex networks is a problem of broad interest with applications in social , biological , communications systems and many other branches . generally speaking , `` community detection '' @xcite attempts to identify relevant structure in a complex network by searching for clusters of nodes ( which are termed _ communities _ ) that have a higher density of internal edges ( i.e. , intra - community links ) than they have with other communities ( inter - community links)@xcite .    a wide variety of methods for community detection have been developed over the past decade @xcite .",
    "more recently , an intense effort has been expended on understanding the theoretical foundations of these methods and of community structure in general .",
    "this was underscored by fortunato and barthlemy when they demonstrated that maximizing `` modularity '' @xcite , a common measure of network partitioning , suffered from a fundamental limitation .",
    "modularity is a global network parameter which measures the quality of any particular network partition .",
    "higher modularity is taken to mean that more meaningful communities are found @xcite",
    ". a fundamental shortcoming of this method is that the local community partitions determined by maximizing modularity depend on the global size of the network @xcite .",
    "a prevalent method of judging the performance of community detection algorithms involves `` planting '' initially well - defined community partitions into a random network in progressively more challenging contexts ( more extraneous and/or fewer inter - community edges ) .",
    "a vivid example of such a planted state is provided by the cartoon of fig .  [",
    "fig : planted ] depicting @xmath1 communities , each with @xmath2 nodes , and the internal / external edges associated with a specific node ; in this cartoon for each node there are far more internal intra - community edges than links between nodes in different communities .",
    "such benchmarks are generally defined by a set of parameters specifying the edge densities within the planted communities and an amount of `` noise '' representing additional spurious edges between nodes in different communities .",
    "the goal of community detection algorithms , as applied to the particular case of benchmark graphs , is to rediscover the embedded communities in given network with no prior information about the planted partition .",
    "community detection methods are then tested against increasingly challenging benchmarks until detection of viable communities becomes impossible .",
    "common benchmarks of planted partitions include stochastic block models , a benchmark by lancichinetti , fortunato , and raddicchi ( lfr ) which focuses on power law distributions of nodes and degrees @xcite , and a variety of `` real - life networks '' .",
    "recent theoretical work studied the limits of various community detection methods with increasing levels of noise .",
    "is drawn , and we see it has more edges to community @xmath3 than @xmath4 .",
    "community detection algorithms are thus expected to be able to find that this node belongs to the @xmath3 community . ]    in @xcite , it was demonstrated that community detection as ascertained by potts models in rather general random power - law type graphs may exhibit sharp spin - glass type transitions as a function of increasing noise in the limit of large system size .",
    "these transitions were evinced via thermodynamic functions , dynamical quantities , and information theoretic overlaps .",
    "various groups have obtained highly noteworthy explicit equations for the transition lines for the community detection problem as applied a particular class of graph , the uniform ( or vanishing power law ) `` stochastic block model '' ( sbm ) on which we further focus on in this paper .",
    "as we will elaborate on , sbms are random graphs defined by a constant number @xmath5 of nodes per community and fixed intra- and inter - community edge densities .",
    "sbms exhibit a transition whose presence was made very evident in numerical studies of a potts type approach to community detection as the system size was progressively increased , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "we note the analysis of decelle , _ et .",
    "al . _ ( dkmz ) @xcite on the inference of possible assignments of nodes to their proper communities in sparse ( i.e. , graphs with a small number of links per node ) sbm networks which has led to an explicit equation for the detectability threshold .",
    "later stringent results by mossel , neeman , and sly @xcite on the general limits of bayesian inference for @xmath1 component sparse graphs concurred ( as a bound ) with the formula derived by dkmz via their cavity - type approximations . in an illuminating work , nadakuditi and newman ( nn ) @xcite reported on an inherent accuracy limit for modularity - based community detection methods as appplied to sbms .",
    "nn found an expression identical to the earlier result of dkmz for the threshold of noise beyond which spectral methods can not resolve the communities . in the analysis of nn",
    ", average degree diverges with the network size . after comparing to the earlier result of dkmz , nadakuditi and newman asserted that no method can perform better than modularity on sbm graphs .",
    "nn further provided an important additional formula for the _ fraction of properly detected nodes _ as a function of noise .",
    "it is this formula of nn that largely inspired the current investigation . in what will follow in this article",
    ", we will derive lower bounds for such a fraction .",
    "earlier pioneering works are also extremely noteworthy . amongst others ,",
    "earlier analysis @xcite was performed for non - dilute graphs .",
    "based on the cavity approximation , reichardt and leone insightfully initially suggested a similar threshold beyond which detection of communities is no longer possible @xcite .    in the present work , we will derive universal rigorous bounds on the feasibility of well - defined community structure independent of any specific community detection methods .",
    "our results are related to fundamental , generic properties of community structure and pertain to _",
    "general networks_. _ we rigorously examine when a benchmark network may have any meaningful structure in the first place .",
    "_ we do this by looking microscopically at each node to determine the ability of any algorithm to properly classify that node : an assertion that each node be more strongly connected ( by more edges ) to its intended community than to any other community . due to stochastic fluctuations in edge placement",
    ", there typically is a nontrivial ( and as we illustrate in this work , computable ) number of nodes where this is not the case",
    ". we will derive rigorous upper bounds for the fraction of nodes which may be detectable at all .",
    "while these calculations lead to an upper bound , they are _ not _ necessarily equivalent to a calculation of optimal performance of community detection algorithms . in fact , we find further evidence for a region where graph structure exists but certain methods may not be able to detect it .",
    "we now elaborate in more detail on the stochastic block benchmark and further general reasoning behind benchmark graphs .",
    "although the ideas advanced in our work hold for any system , we will , for concreteness , focus on the stochastic block model ( sbm ) .",
    "the sbm is defined as follows .",
    "each node belongs to one community ( or `` block '' ) @xcite .",
    "the probability of having an edge between two nodes depends solely on their community membership .",
    "specifically , the probability ( @xmath6 ) of having an edge between any pair of nodes belonging to the same community ( intra - community edges ) is fixed to a certain value @xmath7 and the probability of having an edge between any two nodes that belong to two different blocks ( inter - community edges ) is given by another uniform value @xmath6 .",
    "when a benchmark graph is used , it is assumed that there is a planted community structure which one may ( and should if the community detection algorithm is good ) consistently detect .",
    "such a planted structure can be thought of being generated by the following gedanken experiment .",
    "imagine that we `` plant '' a community partition solution by dividing a group of @xmath8 nodes into @xmath9 equivalent , completely decoupled , communities of size @xmath10 each . within each community",
    "the probability that a given node will be connected by an edge to any other node in the same community is @xmath11 .",
    "an absence of any inter - community links in the initial decoupled state implies that the probability of having a link between any two nodes that belong to different communities is @xmath12 . in the absence of any such inter - community links ,",
    "finding the planted communities is a relatively easy task .",
    "next , imagine that more and more edges are added between different communities ( i.e. , that the probability for outside links ( or `` noise '' ) @xmath6 is progressively increased ) while the number of intra - community edges is left unchanged .",
    "it is intuitively clear that for `` small '' @xmath6 , finding the planted community will be easy while for sufficiently large @xmath6 , the structure of the planted partition will be no longer be well - defined .",
    "work shows that the network structure becomes hard to detect at the point @xmath13 , which is distinctly different from the point of loss of structure at @xmath14@xcite .",
    "this implies that there are points where there is some nominal structure present in the graph ( @xmath15 ) yet that structure is undetectable by any method . instead of focusing on detectability directly , we study the amount of structure which is actually present in the graph .    when the planted communities are , as is the case for sufficiently small @xmath6 , reflected in the edge structure , we will term these graphs `` well - defined . ''",
    "an `` ill - defined '' graph is , for a sufficiently large @xmath6 , one in which the assigned edge structure does not reflect the planted communities .",
    "an extreme example of an ill - defined graph is afforded by a network in which nodes are assigned ( planted ) into communities , but then all edges are randomly defined with no preference for intracommunity or inter - community links .",
    "no community detection method would be able to detect the purported `` communities '' in this case as the input ( edge structure ) is assigned independent of the intended communities . in the above description , well - defined structure is described as a graph property , but it can also be applied to individual nodes .",
    "we reiterate that our focus is not simply that of establishing a community detection limit .",
    "rather , we focus on a fundamental limit concerning the creation of such benchmark graphs .",
    "several authors have hinted at this effect in the past , however , it has never been rigorously analyzed and considered as a fundamental limitation of community detection @xcite . while we do not directly explain the origin of the detectability threshold in this work , we provide tools to analyze the divergence of structure and detectability .",
    "the remainder of this work is organized as follows : we start our discussion with the definition of the sbm problem and our criterion for a well defined community partition . in section [ newton_binom ]",
    ", we set up our formalism and express the problem of a planted state in terms of a binomial distribution . in section [ bm - community ] , we write the corresponding exact expressions for the probability that a planted partition satisfies our criterion for a well defined community partition .",
    "we then introduce , in section [ sec : independence_approx ] , a simple approximation for computing these probabilities . in section [ fraction ] , we write general exact expressions for the fraction of nodes in the planted partition that satisfy our criterion for community detection .",
    "we then turn to illustrate via a trivial application of jensen s inequality that the approximation of section [ jensen ] provides rigorous lower bounds on the probability that our criteria for a well defined partition are satisfied .",
    "armed with all of these formal results for the sbm problem , we then briefly turn to consider their implications .",
    "we first consider , in section [ sec : thresholds ] , threshold values of the noise @xmath6 beyond which well defined community partitions are no longer possible .",
    "this will allow for a relation between our results and the phase boundaries of the detectable region of the phase diagram .",
    "in section [ sec : consequences ] , we discuss the abstract meaning of our `` well - defined fraction '' and make a comparison , between our analysis and that of systems in which ill - defined nodes are shifted to their correct communities .",
    "we then discuss , in section [ apply ] , the breadth of graph types and community detection methods to which our work is applicable . in section [ sec : phase_transitions ] , we examine the behavior of our well defined transitions as our systems increase in size ; we will see that our transitions between well- and ill - defined benchmarks become sharp . in section [ sec : nn_compare ] , we compare our limits of well - definedness to other established limits of community detection to see that they agree in a certain limit , with the a region of well - defined but undetectable communities shrinking as our system grows larger .",
    "we point out , in section [ sec : bm - accurate_methods ] , how high performance algorithms lead to results that coincide , in certain limits , with our computed `` well - defined '' fraction . in section [ general_section ]",
    "we discuss possible extensions of our approach to other problems and further note possible bounds on the region where a computationally solvable `` hard phase '' appears ; in this phase , purported solutions of the community detection problem may be easily checkable in polynomial time ( as in any np problem@xcite ) yet finding these solutions ( even though they exist ) might not be efficiently achieved by general algorithms .",
    "we conclude , in section [ sec : bm - conclusions ] , by summarizing our main results with an eye towards their practical significance .",
    "as we stated in the introduction , when formally defined , sbms constitute benchmark graphs in which planted communities are specified for each node , and edges are assigned between every pair of nodes with a probability @xmath16 which depends only on the communities @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the two nodes , respectively . in order for communities to be defined , one would expect that the density of links between communities inside a community @xmath3 will exceed that between communities @xmath3 and @xmath4@xcite , @xmath17 however , we reiterate that in this work , we will show that due to the fluctuations in number of edges connecting a given node to other communities ( _ i.e. _ , not its _ own _ ) , it is possible , in fact likely , to have nodes which are not well - defined in their community even with @xmath18 above the threshold of eq .",
    "( [ eq : palphabeta ] ) . unlike some other particular approaches , @xcite",
    "this is not a limit of a particular community detection method , or limitation on possible inference of structure . amongst earlier works on sbms that invoke inference methods ,",
    "we explicitly re - iterate and note anew the cavity - type approximations of @xcite and a later non - trivial rigorous result @xcite partially reaffirming the cavity approximations for when structure in sparse sbms may be not be inferable for the particular case of @xmath1 communities .",
    "instead of asking whether inference or other methods may succeed , our results relate to the _ fundamental structure _ of the graph itself , as suggested in @xcite . as such , our results lead to universal intrinsic bounds for any community detection method or inference considerations .",
    "we now turn to the sbm network with @xmath9 communities of size @xmath19 nodes per community @xmath3 and a total number of nodes @xmath20 , with particular values of @xmath7 and @xmath6 . in a random realization of an sbm graph with these parameters , the internal degree @xmath21 of a node to its community",
    "@xmath3 ( the `` internal degree '' ) follows the binomial distribution ( @xmath22 ) with @xmath23 attempts to make an edge , each with a probability @xmath7 , @xmath24 = \\mathcal{b}(k ; n_{a}-1 , p_\\mathrm{in}).\\ ] ] associated with any particular _ single _ external community @xmath4 , there is a binomial probability distribution of the external degree @xmath25 = \\mathcal{b}(k ; n , p_\\mathrm{out}).\\ ] ] the form of the binomial distribution is given at the end of this section .",
    "note that @xmath26 is the external degree to a specific community @xmath4 , as opposed to the external degree summed over all @xmath27 external communities .",
    "also , note that there are @xmath28 possible internal edges since we consider nodes to not link to themselves , but @xmath5 possible external edges to each external community .",
    "if all communities are of the same size @xmath5 ( i.e. , if all communities are comprised of @xmath5 nodes ) , we will say that a node @xmath29 `` is well - defined '' in its planted community @xmath3 for this node if there are more internal than external connections _ to any one external community_. that is , @xmath30 for _ all _ communities @xmath31 .",
    "one key concept here which bears restatement is that any node can have more external ( summed over the other @xmath32 communities ) than internal edges and yet still be properly defined in its ground - state community if the many external links are spread out over enough different external communities .",
    "we note that this is more relaxed than the radicchi definition of `` weak '' community in @xcite .",
    "as numerical results illustrate , we can detect communities well past the weak definition @xcite .",
    "zhang and zhao also point out another intuitive case @xcite where the strong and weak definitions of community structure proposed by radicchi are both violated .    in order to generalize our considerations to unequal sized communities",
    ", we employ the edge density @xmath33 instead of the raw number of links@xcite . for a node to be well - defined in a community",
    ", the edge density to that community must be greater than the edge density to any other community .",
    "this assumption is discussed later .",

    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) counts the number of nodes not satisfying our well - defined criteria , we have the correspondence @xmath91 according to the postulates regarding well - definedness in this work , _ minimizing this energy corresponds to a rudimentary form of community detection_. with the hamiltonian at hand , we can go beyond an analysis of the system ground states and examine whether it is possible to optimally satisfy the community detection criteria .",
    "we can now , as in @xcite , broadly define and examine finite temperature entropy , energy , spin - glass type phase transitions that they exhibit , and much more .",
    "a trivial yet important point which we wish to emphasize is the following .",
    "the planted graph partition might be viewed as a variational state .",
    "that is , if the planted partition satisfies eq .",
    "( [ important_density ] ) or , correspondingly , is a zero energy ( ground state ) of the energy function of eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) then clearly there is at least one state for which eq .",
    "( [ important_density ] ) is satisfied .",
    "similarly , if a planted state violates a certain number of conditions of the form of eq .",
    "( [ important_density ] ) then there exists at least one partition ( i.e. , the planted state ) which violates the same number of conditions .",
    "however , by adjusting the community assignments , we may find a different state ( i.e. , one which differs from the planted state ) which break a smaller number of these conditions and is thus of lower energy .",
    "we will denote the fraction of well defined nodes and associated threshold values for this minimal energy state(s ) by @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "this is primarily important when we are detecting communities without knowledge of the planted state ( i.e. , the general practical task of community detection algorithms ) .",
    "in such a case , we search for a state that violates the least number of constraints of the form of eq .",
    "( [ important_density ] ) or equivalently has the lowest energy in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "thus , for any given graph , we will trivially have the inequalities @xmath94 similar to eqs .",
    "( [ upper_threshold ] , [ lower_threshold ] ) , on the lefthand side of eq .",
    "( [ trivial_threshold1 ] ) , @xmath95 denote , respectively , values of the noise at which @xmath96 is equal to the lower and upper threshold values for the correctly placed nodes relative to the lowest energy state ( with no knowledge of a planted state ) .",

    "( [ trivial_threshold1 ] ) , @xmath97 denote the noise values @xmath82 at which the fraction of correctly placed nodes @xmath96 achieves lower and upper threshold values relative to a known planted state .",
    "the variational state provided by the planted state , if anything , may lead us to believe that our threshold is _ smaller _ than it actually is for finding sensible community partitions .",
    "the fact that we detect the lowest - energy ground state , instead of the variational ( planted ) state , leads us to infer a _ greater _",
    "threshold for community detection than we actually have .",
    "this may be of utility when the true communities are not known , and the accuracy of the detection must be inferred from the relative noise .",
    "as is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : bmfitness-2x50 ] , there is ( for general non - vanishing @xmath98 and/or in dense graphs ) a finite interval of @xmath82 values for which ( i ) _ there are _ on average , as we proved , still meaningful partitions ( which can be checked in polynomial time for the conditions specified by eq .",
    "( [ important_density ] ) ) yet ( ii ) according to , e.g. , @xcite _ there are no spectral algorithms _ that can efficiently ascertain structure .",
    "together , this suggests as a matter of principle a route for establishing a hard phase as probed by various specific algorithms .",
    "the hard phase consists of very challenging graph partitioning problems that can not be solved efficiently ( i.e. , may be non - polynomial problems ) by any algorithm yet purported solutions can be checked in polynomial time ( i.e. , belonging to np ) .",
    "namely , this situation is one for which the old conjecture @xmath99 may explicitly come to life@xcite .",
    "we caution that our work ( which leads to item(i ) above ) centered on the use of eq .",
    "( [ important_density ] ) while others @xcite did not use these criteria for their point of departure .",
    "when satisfied , the criteria of eq .",
    "( [ important_density ] ) suggest community structure yet it is possible that non - trivial meaningful clusters can be inferred such that they adhere to other criteria .",
    "the rigorous upper bounds that we derived in the current work do not incorporate `` cascade effects '' ( sec .  [ fraction ] ) ; when these are taken into account , cascade effects may generally lead to lower threshold values of the noise beyond which well defined structure ceases to exist .",
    "we reiterate that the cavity - type approximations of dkmz @xcite lead to results identical to those of nn as suggested by spectral methods .",
    "we should further remark anew that , as illustrated by @xcite , no bayesian inference algorithm can detect structure beyond for noise values larger the dkmz expression for the special case of sparse sbm graphs with @xmath1 communities .",
    "the general considerations that we invoked here for finding where the hard phase may potentially appear may be replicated to other computational problems .",
    "we conclude with a brief synopsis of our results :    @xmath100 _ community detection as a function of graph structure . _",
    "detecting communities in general graphs is an np - type problem that has gained much attention in the last decades .",
    "more recently , several groups have examined a particular subclass - the stochastic block model graphs - with the goal of calculating noise thresholds on the ability to detect community structure via various algorithms such as those involving spectral methods or considerations related to the fundamental ability of disparate methods to infer structure .",
    "these methods were examined elegantly via the cavity - type approximations and have been bolstered by other considerations . in this work , we take a different path to attack this problem .",
    "specifically , instead of studying limitations of various algorithmic or inference approaches we have turned the problem around and examined the properties of the graph itself to examine to what the community detection partition of the system may have a well - defined solution .",
    "_ this approach enabled us to derive universal bounds independent of any particular community detection algorithm and/or inference methods / approximations_. we invoked a simple criterion for community structure that relies on edge densities . using this , we derived a relationship for the fraction of nodes consistent with the correct community assignment .",
    "our approach is much simpler that of past works and offers a complimentary understanding on the limits of detectability .",
    "the ideas introduced in our work , with the principle of focusing on the problem itself , independent of any known algorithms or inference approximations , might have also applications in the analysis of other hard computational problems .",
    "@xmath100 _ rigorous bounds on well - definedness and community detection algorithms . _ our bound on the highest number of correctly identifiable vertices of the planted state , in the non - sparse case ( such that the exact binomial distribution may be replaced by a normal distibution ) is given by @xmath101 of eq .",
    "( [ xweqe ] ) ( wherein the corresponding cdf is given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : indeppnormalapprox ] , [ pwab ] ) and the pdf is given by eq .",
    "( [ inp ] ) ) .",
    "we reiterate that this provides a strict upper bound on the accuracy of any community detection method for planted equal community size stochastic block model graphs . for sparse graphs , the exact binomial distribution ( or its poisson distribution approximation )",
    "may be invoked in the probability distribution functions .",
    "furthermore , we have derived an `` independence approximation '' which is most accurate for a small number of communities @xmath9 or high @xmath68 .",
    "we have shown , by a simple application of jensen s inequality , that the independence approximation leads to a strict lower bound on the actual fraction of well defined nodes , @xmath102 . finally , by comparison with previous accurate community detection algorithms , we have shown that our @xmath68 bound is indeed an upper limit for all of these algorithms as is clearly seen in fig.([fig : bmfitness - methods - compare ] ) .",
    "we achieve the greatest accuracy when @xmath68 is high , minimizing cascade effects of ill - definedness .",
    "we have established that by focusing on ill - defined nodes and assigning these to the optimal communities , the transition to structureless partitions is no longer as precipitous as it is otherwise . the bounds that we obtain on @xmath68 correlate emulates and narrowly lie above the curves found by nn @xcite for the fraction of well - defined nodes .",
    "@xmath100 _ sharp behavior in large - size limit .",
    "_ we have demonstrated that as community size @xmath5 increases , the width of the transition between well - defined and ill - defined decreases . the absolute potts model approach to community detection problems @xcite substantiated how the width of intermediate `` hard '' phase decreases as @xmath73 becomes progressively larger@xcite for dilute graphs .",
    "@xmath100 _ difference between solvable problems and checkable solutions .",
    "_ taken together , the results that we derived in this work for ( i ) cases when graphs have well defined underlying structure and ( iii ) earlier results @xcite concerning the limitations of general spectral algorithms and inference approaches suggest bounds on the hard phase . within the hard phase , the community detection problem can not be efficiently solved yet for which purported solutions can be checked in polynomial time .",
    "away from the large @xmath73 limit in dilute graphs the combined results of ( i ) and ( ii ) allow for the emergence of polynomially checkable yet extremely hard to solve problems .",
    "that is , away from these limits , the hard phase may appear .",
    "the surplus of the fraction of well - defined nodes @xmath96 that we found in the current work ( irrespective of applied algorithm ) as compared to the fraction found by the modularity matrix based algorithm of nn @xcite is notable .",
    "this disparity may highlight difference between solvable problems ( nn ) and rigorous bounds on proposed contending checkable solutions ( the current work ) by examining the fraction of nodes that satisfy the criteria for well - definedess .",
    "@xmath100 _ relevance to benchmark graphs .",
    "_ perhaps the most practical implication of this work relates to the construction and analysis of benchmark graphs for community detection . in order to judge the effectiveness of any algorithm",
    ", one must know the expected maximal possible performance .",
    "we investigated the performance of various algorithms and examined upper and lower threshold values of noise in stochastic block model graph benchmarks and the role of ill - defined nodes where the community detection criteria are not satisfied .",
    "benchmark graphs such as that of lfr @xcite can be designed to avoid ill - defined nodes by applying a `` rewiring '' step which keeps internal to external edges at as constant a ratio as possible . in a companion work",
    ", we advanced _ a general edge density based approach to community detection _ which complements the edge density criteria of eq .",
    "( [ important_density ] ) that we invoked in the current work@xcite .",
    "aside from examining nodes and their respective edge densities as criteria for stable communities as we have in this work , we may also apply similar criteria to the _ density of connections between links _",
    "( i.e. , look at a dual graph formed by the vertices placed at the centers of each link of the original graph and ask whether an edge density criterion is satisfied for the edges between these link centers ) _ or connections between triangles _",
    ", etc . @xcite .    our analysis , while detailed , raises many further questions .",
    "can this analysis be extended to different cost functions , or graphs with power law degree distributions ?",
    "can we successfully model cascade effects , where each incorrect nodes affects the size of communities and thus affects more than just itself ?",
    "perhaps most importantly , how does this issue intersect with real - world graphs ?",
    "we hope that in such graphs with real - world planted states , there is some best community definition . using an analysis similar to the one presented here , to what degree does",
    "the graphs edge structure reflects those communities ?    in closing , we remark that _ the analysis we employ here could , potentially , be extended and applied to other random computational problems_. in addition to tackling the algorithmic limits of the solution process , our approach enables one to examine said limits from structural standpoint of the problem itself .    * note added in proof * : the bulk of this work first appeared in the phd thesis of one of us ( rkd ) in october 2012 ( available online at @xcite ) , which extensively studied the issues surrounding ill - defined nodes .",
