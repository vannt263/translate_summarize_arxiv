    "diophantine equations_. a diophantine equation is an equation of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a polynomial with integer coefficients , and one asks for solutions in",
    "_ integers _ ( or rational numbers , depending on the problem ) .",
    "they are named after diophantos of alexandria on whom not much is known with any certainty .",
    "most likely he lived around 300  ad .",
    "he wrote the _ arithmetika _ , a text consisting of 13  books , a number of which have been preserved . in this text",
    ", he explains through many examples ways of solving certain kinds of equations like the above in rational numbers .",
    "diophantos was also one of the first to introduce symbolic notation for the powers of an indeterminate .",
    "to give you a flavor of this kind of question , let me show you some examples .",
    "ideally , you should cover up the part of the page below the equation and try to find a solution for yourself before you read on .",
    "the first equation is @xmath2 an equation in three unknowns , to be solved in ( not necessarily positive ) integers .",
    "i trust it did not take you very long to come up with a solution like @xmath3 or maybe @xmath4 .",
    "now let us look at @xmath5 try to solve it for a while before you look up a solution in this footnote@xmath6 .. this solution is the smallest and was found by computer search in july  1999 and published in  2007  @xcite .",
    "this already indicates that it may be quite hard to find a solution to a given diophantine equation",
    ". now consider @xmath7 did you try to solve it ?",
    "you should have come to the conclusion that there is no solution : the third power of an integer is always @xmath8 or @xmath9 , so a sum of three cubes can never be @xmath10 or @xmath11 . since @xmath12 , the number @xmath13 can not be a sum of three cubes .",
    "if we replace @xmath13 with  @xmath14 , the same argument applies .",
    "so we consider @xmath15 next .",
    "if you were able to solve this , you should consider making diophantine equations your research area .",
    "the sad state of affairs is that it is an open problem whether this equation has a solution in integers or not !",
    "so the following looks like an interesting problem : to decide if a given diophantine equation is solvable or not . in fact",
    ", this problem appears on the most famous list of mathematical problems , namely the 23  problems david hilbert stated in his address to the international congress of mathematicians in paris in  1900 as questions worth working on in the new century .",
    "the description of the tenth problem in hilbert s list reads thus ( in the german original  @xcite , see  @xcite for an english translation of hilbert s address ) :    here is an english translation .",

    "this is commonly known as _",
    "hilbert s tenth problem_. it is not only the shortest problem on hilbert s list , it is also the only decision problem , so it is somewhat special . from the wording it can be inferred that hilbert believed in a positive solution to his problem : such an algorithm had to exist .",
    "in fact , at the end of the introductory part of his speech , before turning to the list of problems , he says    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  in der mathematik giebt es kein ignorabimus ! _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    ( there is no ` ignorabimus ' in mathematics . )",
    "this indicates that hilbert was convinced that every mathematical problem must have a definite solution .",
    "the simple examples i have shown at the beginning may ( or should ) have given you a feeling that this problem may actually be very hard .",
    "this is also what happened historically .",
    "people got more and more convinced that the answer to hilbert s tenth problem was likely to be negative : an algorithm conforming to the given specification does not exist . now",
    "if an algorithm does exist that performs a certain task , it is fairly clear how one can prove this fact .",
    "namely , one has to find such an algorithm and write it down , then everybody will agree that it indeed _ is _ an algorithm solving the given problem . to show that such an algorithm _ does not _",
    "exist is a quite different matter .",
    "one needs some way of getting a handle on all possible algorithms , so that one can show that none of them solves the problem . the relevant theory , which is a branch of mathematical logic , did not yet exist when hilbert gave his talk .",
    "it was developed a few decades later , leading to such famous results as gdel s incompleteness theorem , which definitely showed that there certainly is an _",
    "ignorabimus _ in mathematics .",
    "indeed , work of several people , most notably martin davis , hilary putnam and julia robinson , made it possible for yuri matiyasevich to finally prove in  1970 the following result .",
    "[ thm:1 ]     + the solvability of diophantine equations is undecidable .    in fact , he proved a much stronger result , which implies for example that there is an explicit polynomial @xmath18 such that there is no algorithm that , given @xmath19 as input , decides whether or not there is an integral solution to @xmath20 note that if a diophantine equation is solvable , then we can prove it , since we will eventually find a solution by searching through the countably many possibilities ( but we do not know beforehand how far we have to search ) .",
    "so the really hard problem is to prove that there are no solutions when this is the case .",
    "a similar problem arises when there are finitely many solutions and we want to find them all .",
    "in this situation one expects the solutions to be fairly small is no counterexample to this statement , since there should be infinitely many solutions in this case . ] .",
    "so usually it is not so hard to find all solutions ; what is difficult is to show that there are no others .",
    "so , given theorem  [ thm:1 ] , should we give up all attempts to solve diophantine equations , convinced that the task is completely hopeless ?",
    "that would be premature .",
    "we might still be able to prove positive results when we restrict the set of equations in some way .",
    "for example , there are quite good reasons to believe that there should be a positive answer to hilbert s question for equations _ in two variables_. in the remainder of this contribution , we will consider one such equation as an example case and show with what kind of methods it can be attacked and solved .",
    "the equation we want to consider here is motivated by the following question .",
    "consider pascal s triangle ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pascal ] ) . which natural numbers occur several times in this triangle , if we disregard the outer two `` layers '' ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) on either side and the obvious reflectional symmetry ?",
    "in other words , what are the integral solutions to the equation @xmath23 subject to the conditions @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 ?",
    "the following solutions are known .",
    "@xmath27 where @xmath28 is the @xmath29-th fibonacci number .",
    "equation  ( [ bineq ] ) is not a diophantine equation according to our definition , since it depends on @xmath30 and  @xmath31 in a non - polynomial way .",
    "also , it is way too hard to solve .",
    "so we specialize by fixing @xmath30 and  @xmath32 .",
    "the cases @xmath33 have already been solved completely , see  @xcite .",
    "each of these cases requires some deep mathematics of a flavor similar to what is described below .",
    "the next interesting case is obviously @xmath34 , leading to the equation @xmath35 so we are asking for numbers that occur both in the red and the blue diagonal in figure  [ fig : pascal ] .",
    "the first step in solving an equation like  ( [ eqn : example ] ) is to go and look for its solutions .",
    "we easily find solutions with @xmath36 and then no further ones .",
    "( only the last two are ` nontrivial ' in the sense that they satisfy the constraints given above . also , there are no solutions with @xmath37 , since then the right hand side is negative , but the left hand side can never be negative for @xmath38 . )",
    "this now raises the question if we have already found them all , and if so , how to prove it .",
    "this is a good point to look at what is known about the solution set of equations like  ( [ eqn : example ] ) in general .",
    "the first important result was proved by carl ludwig siegel in  1929 .",
    "( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  d.9 ) for a proof . )",
    "[ thm : siegel ]     + let @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "if the solutions to @xmath40 can not be rationally parameterized , then @xmath41 has only finitely many solutions in integers .",
    "a _ rational parameterization _ of @xmath40 is a pair of rational functions @xmath42 , @xmath43 ( quotients of polynomials ) , not both constant , such that @xmath44 ( as a function of  @xmath45 ) .",
    "the existence of such a rational parameterization can be algorithmically checked ; for our equation it turns out that it is not rationally parameterizable .",
    "so we already know that there are only finitely many solutions .",
    "in particular , we have a chance that our list is complete .",
    "on the other hand , theorem  [ thm : siegel ] and its proof are inherently _ ineffective _ : we do not get a bound on the size of the solutions , so this result gives us no way of checking that our list is complete .",
    "this somewhat unsatisfactory state of affairs did not change until the 1960s , when alan baker developed his theory of ` linear forms in logarithms ' that for the first time provided explicit bounds for solutions of many types of equations . for this breakthrough",
    ", he received the fields medal .",
    "baker s results cover a class of equations that contains our equation  ( [ eqn : example ] ) . for our case ,",
    "what he proved comes down to roughly the following .",
    "@xmath46 this reduces the solution of our equation  ( [ eqn : example ] ) to a finite problem . the inequality in  ( [ eqn : baker ] ) gives us an explicit upper bound for  @xmath47 .",
    "so we only have to check the finitely many possibilities that remain , and we will obtain the complete set of solutions to  ( [ eqn : example ] ) . from a very pure mathematics viewpoint , we may therefore consider our problem as solved . on the other hand , from a more practical point of view",
    ", we would like to actually obtain the complete list of solutions , and the assertion that it is possible in principle to get it does not satisfy us . to say that the number showing up in  ( [ eqn : baker ] ) defies all imagination is a horrible understatement , and one can not even begin to figure out how long it would take to actually perform all the necessary computations .",
    "however , time did not stop in the 1960s , and with basically still the same method , but with a lot of refinements and improvements thrown in , we are now able to prove the following estimate . @xmath48 you may rightly ask whether something has really been gained , in practical terms .",
    "the number of electrons in the universe is estimated to be about  @xmath49 , so we can not even write down a number with something like @xmath50  digits ! however , it will turn out that the improvement represented by  ( [ eqn : better ] ) is crucial .",
    "but before we can see this , we need to look at our problem from a different angle .",
    "the idea is to translate our at first sight algebraic problem ( ( [ eqn : example ] ) is an algebraic equation ) into a geometric one .",
    "an equation @xmath40 in two variables defines a subset of the plane , consisting of those points whose coordinates satisfy the equation . if @xmath1 is a ( non - constant ) polynomial , this solution set",
    "is called a _",
    "plane algebraic curve_. we can draw the curve  @xmath51 corresponding to our equation  ( [ eqn : example ] ) in the real plane  @xmath52 , see fig .  [",
    "fig : curve ] .",
    "we are now interested in the _ integral points _ on  @xmath51 , since they correspond to integral solutions to  ( [ eqn : example ] ) .",
    "the set of integral points on  @xmath51 is denoted  @xmath53 .    ) , with some integral points.,scaledwidth=62.5% ]    this set @xmath53 of integral points on the curve  @xmath51 by itself does not have any useful additional structure .",
    "but we can make use of a well - developed theory , called algebraic geometry , that studies sets defined by a collection of polynomial equations , and in particular algebraic curves like  @xmath51 .",
    "this theory tells us that we can _ embed _ the curve  @xmath51 into another object  @xmath54 , which is not a curve , but a surface .",
    "this can be constructed for any curve and is called the _",
    "jacobian variety _ of the curve .",
    "the interesting fact about  @xmath54 ( and jacobian varieties in general ) is that @xmath54 is a  _ group_. more precisely , there is a composition law on  @xmath54 that is defined in a geometric way and that turns ( for example ) the set @xmath55 of integral points is a projective variety .",
    "( which means that the coordinates can be scaled so as to remove denominators . ) ] on  @xmath54 into an _ abelian group .",
    "_ in a similar spirit as siegel s theorem  [ thm : siegel ] ( and actually preceding it ) , we have the following important result , valid for jacobian varieties in general .",
    "( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* part  c ) . )",
    "[ thm : weil ]     + if @xmath54 is the jacobian variety of a curve , then the abelian group @xmath55 is finitely generated .",
    "this means that we can ( in principle ) get an explicit description of the group  @xmath55 in terms of generators and relations .",
    "if we have that , we may be able to use the group structure and the geometry in some way to get a handle on the elements of  @xmath55 that are in the image of  @xmath51 ; these correspond exactly to the integral points on  @xmath51 .    in general",
    ", it is not known whether it is always possible to actually determine explicit generators of a group like  @xmath55 in an algorithmic way , although there are some ` standard conjectures ' whose truth would imply a positive answer .",
    "there are methods available that , with some luck , can find a set of generators , but they are not guaranteed to work in all cases .",
    "this is the point where the method we are describing may fail in practice . in our specific example",
    ", we are lucky , and we can show that @xmath55 is a",
    "_ free abelian group of rank  6 _ : @xmath56 with explicitly known points @xmath57 .",
    "let @xmath58 denote the embedding of  @xmath51 into  @xmath54 .",
    "the surface  @xmath54 lives in some high - dimensional space , and we can specify integral points on it by a bunch of coordinates . we can measure the size of such a point by taking the logarithm of the largest absolute value of the coordinates ( this tells us roughly how much space we need to write the point down ) .",
    "this gives us a function @xmath59 called the _",
    "height_. one can show that this height function has the following properties .",
    "the first one tells us how the height relates to the size of integral points on our curve .",
    "@xmath60 for points @xmath61 such that @xmath47 is not very small .",
    "the second property says that the height function behaves well with respect to the group structure on  @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath62 ( to be precise , each side can be bounded by an explicit constant multiple of the other one . to be more precise",
    ", @xmath63 is , up to a bounded error , a positive definite quadratic form on  @xmath55 . )",
    "if we now combine the estimate  ( [ eqn : better ] ) with the properties ( [ eqn : heightc ] ) and  ( [ eqn : heightj ] ) of the height  @xmath63 , then we obtain the following statement .",
    "if @xmath61 , then we have @xmath64 with coefficients @xmath65 satisfying @xmath66 .",
    "of course , the bound @xmath67 given here is not precise ; a precise bound can be given and is of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the conclusion is that using the additional structure we have on  @xmath54 enables us to reduce the size of the search space from about @xmath68 to ` only ' @xmath69 ( there are six coefficients @xmath70 with about  @xmath67 possible values each ) .",
    "this is , of course , still much too large to check each possibility ( think of the electrons in the universe ) , but , and this is the decisive point , the numbers @xmath70 we have to deal with can be represented easily on a computer , and we _ can compute _ with them !",
    "we now have an enormous haystack @xmath71 of about @xmath69 pieces of grass that contains a small number of needles .",
    "we want to find the needles . instead of looking at each blade of grass in the haystack , we can try to solve this problem faster by finding conditions on the possible positions of the needles that rule out large parts of the haystack .",
    "this is the point where we make use of the fact that the group law on  @xmath54 is defined via geometry .",
    "our objects @xmath51 , @xmath54 and  @xmath72 are defined over  @xmath73 , therefore it makes sense to consider their defining equations modulo  @xmath74 for prime numbers  @xmath74 .",
    "we denote the field @xmath75 of @xmath74  elements by  @xmath76 .",
    "the sets of points with coordinates in  @xmath76 that satisfy these defining equations mod  @xmath74 are denoted by @xmath77 and  @xmath78 .",
    "then for all but finitely many  @xmath74 ( and the exceptions can be found explicitly ) , @xmath78 is again an abelian group , and it contains the image @xmath79 of  @xmath77 . the group @xmath78 is finite , and so is the set  @xmath77 ; both can be computed .",
    "furthermore , the following diagram commutes , and the geometric nature of the group structure implies that the right hand vertical map is a group homomorphism .",
    "@xmath80^{\\iota } \\ar[d ] & j({{\\mathbb z } } ) \\ar@{=}[r ] \\ar[d ]                      & \\mbox{\\raisebox{3pt}{${{\\mathbb z}}^6 $ } } \\ar[dl]^{\\alpha_p } \\\\                 c({{\\mathbb",
    "f}}_p ) \\ar[r]^{\\iota_p } & j({{\\mathbb f}}_p ) &               } \\ ] ] the vertical maps are obtained by reducing the coordinates of the points mod  @xmath74 .",
    "the diagonal map  @xmath81 is again a group homomorphism , determined by the image of the generators @xmath82 of  @xmath55 .",
    "the following is now clear .",
    "the subset @xmath85 is ( usually , when @xmath81 is surjective ) a union of @xmath86 cosets of a subgroup of index  @xmath87 in  @xmath88 . since one can show that @xmath89 and @xmath90 ( reflecting dimensions @xmath91 and  @xmath92 , respectively ) , we see that the intersection of our haystack  @xmath93 with  @xmath94 has only about @xmath95  times as many elements as the original haystack .",
    "this does not yet help very much , but we can try to _ combine _ information coming from _ many _ primes",
    ". if @xmath96 is a ( finite , but large ) set of prime numbers , then we set @xmath97 if we make @xmath96 sufficiently large ( about a thousand primes , say ) , then it is likely that the set on the right hand side is quite small , so that we can easily check the remaining possibilities .",
    "the idea is that the reductions of the haystack size we obtain from several distinct primes should accumulate , so that we can expect a reduction by a factor which is roughly the product of all the primes in  @xmath96 .",
    "we have to be careful to select the primes in a good way so that the description of the sets @xmath98 we encounter on the way stays within a reasonable complexity .",
    "it is , however , indeed possible to make a good selection of primes and to implement the actual computation of  @xmath98 in a reasonably efficient manner , so that a standard pc ( standard as of  2008 ) can perform the calculations in less than a day .",
    "we finally obtain the result we were suspecting from the beginning ."
