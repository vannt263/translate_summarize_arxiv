    "to treat the problem of a metal - insulator transition ( mit ) driven by electron - electron interactions in lattice models with a fractional electron site occupancy , both the on - site and long - range coulomb repulsions are equally important @xcite .",
    "a lattice with geometrical frustration imposes additional complications and may produce new features of mit .",
    "the well known example is the verwey transition @xcite in magnetite ( @xmath0 ) at @xmath1 120k .",
    "magnetite has a spinel structure and @xmath2 sites are occupied regularly with @xmath3 ions . on the @xmath4 sites forming a pyrochlore lattice , the @xmath5 ions are in the mixed valent state of @xmath6=1:1 .",
    "therefore , in the high - temperature charge disordered state , @xmath7 , a band structure calculation would predict a quarter - filled conduction band , i.e. , a metallic state with one itinerant electron per two sites . below the curie temperature @xmath8 of magnetite the itinerant electrons are ( almost ) fully ferromagnetically polarized .",
    "therefore they can be treated as a system of interacting spinless fermions . in terms of spinless fermions ,",
    "the charge occupancy of one electron per two sites corresponds to a half band - filling . below the verwey temperature @xmath9 ,",
    "the charge degrees of freedom are ordered and an insulating state occurs . as was first pointed out by anderson @xcite , properties of the verwey transition can not be understood without taking into account the geometrical frustration and the resulting huge degeneracy of the ground - state charge configurations in the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "two more recent examples of electronic structure changes connected to charge ordering in spinels are found in @xmath10 with temperature decreasing at ambient pressure @xcite and in @xmath11 under the external pressure @xcite .",
    "an interesting observation is that charge ordering in these three spinel systems is accompanied with a lattice structural change , i.e. , the system tries to avoid the geometrical frustration of the pyrochlore structure .",
    "at the same time , no mit and charge ordering were observed in @xmath11 at ambient pressure down to very low temperatures , but instead the metallic compound @xmath11 exhibits a heavy - fermion behavior below 30k @xcite .",
    "most of the work until now has been devoted to an understanding of the magnetic properties of geometrically frustrated lattices such as pyrochlore structure , since in the presence of antiferromagnetic interaction frustration acts against a conventional long - range order and may stabilize a spin - liquid state @xcite .",
    "charge degrees of freedom have in contrast been studied much less @xcite .",
    "in fact , charge ordering in geometrically frustrated systems has been an intriguing and unsettled problems @xcite . for example , numerical diagonalizations of a hamiltonian for spinless fermion with strong nearest - neighbor repulsion on a checkerboard lattice have given evidence that at half filling ( number of spinless fermion equals one half the number of sites ) the ground state is two - fold degenerate but a liquid @xcite .",
    "this must be kept in mind when that system is treated within different approximations leading to a charge ordered ground state . in other words ,",
    "the observed charge order in frustrated structures could crucially depend on associated lattice deformations , i.e. , the involvement of lattice degree of freedom .",
    "the extended hubbard model on non - frustrated lattices has been extensively investigated in one dimension at quarter-@xcite or half - filling@xcite , for two - leg ladders at quarter - filling@xcite , for two - dimensional square lattices at half - filling@xcite and in the limit of infinite dimensions at quarter-@xcite or half - filling@xcite . a variety of techniques , such as hartree - fock approximation , pertubation theory , dynamical mean - field theory , as well as numerical methods , e.g. , quantum monte carlo and density - matrix renormalization group have been employed .",
    "however all these investigations were based on the non - frustrated lattice .    in the present paper",
    ", we apply a green s function approach to study the possible phase transitions of a half - filled spinless fermion model , i.e. , a system with one electron per two sites , on the frustrated checkerboard lattice ( see the inset of fig .",
    "the lattice can be viewed as a two - dimensional projection of a pyrochlore lattice .",
    "the spinless fermion model arises naturally for ferromagnetic materials in which one of the spin - split bands is completely occupied or completely empty as in magnetite @xcite .",
    "also this model can be viewed as a quarter - filled extended hubbard model in the large @xmath12 limit .",
    "then double occupancy of a site is forbidden and the nearest - neighbour coulomb repulsion @xmath13 plays a crucial role . because for ( spinless ) half filling every second site is unoccupied on the average one would naively expect a metallic state .",
    "our main goal in this work is to show that inter - site correlations @xmath13 can lead to a mi transition even for a case with less than one electron per site .",
    "we are using two different methods to study this model .",
    "firstly we employ a single site approach within a hartree - fock as well as hubbard - i type approximations ( sect .",
    "[ 1-site ] ) . by using the hubbbard - i-type decoupling scheme which includes the effect of nearest - neighbor charge fluctuations",
    ", we find that with increasing value of @xmath13 first a metal- insulator transition occurs with a gap in the excitation spectrum , while at even larger values of v charge ordering appears .",
    "this is opposite to the result in the simple hartree - fock approximation , i.e. inter - site correlations favor the mi transition and suppress the co. this observation may indicate that co is indeed not present for a rigid checkerboard or pyrochlore lattice for any v / t ratio ( it certainly is not in the limit v / t@xmath14 ) . indeed in the compounds @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( under pressure ) where co has been found it is accompanied by a lattice distortion .",
    "secondly we start from a cluster representation of the model where the intra - cluster correlations are taken into account exactly and the inter - cluster terms are treated in hartree fock approximation ( sect .",
    "[ cluster ] ) .",
    "this transformation leads to an effective multi - orbital extended hubbard model .",
    "again we find a m - i transition at a value similar to the first approach . in view of the suggestion above we do not consider the possibility of co in this case , although within the hartree fock approximation for the inter - cluster interactions it would presumably be present in the ground state .",
    "furthermore , we investigated the evolution of quasiparticle bands in the various phases in the single - site and cluster approaches . following the selfconsistently determined chemical potential and",
    "the formation of interband gaps allows to determine the critical value for the mi transition .",
    "the hamiltonian for the spinless fermion model is given by @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath13 is the coulomb repulsion between nearest neighbors denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "we refer to this spinless hamiltonian as the @xmath17 model .",
    "first , let us briefly review previous work on the @xmath17 model at half - filling and the closely related quarter - filled extended hubbard model in the large @xmath12 limit for different lattices . in one dimension , the @xmath17 model can be mapped onto an anisotropic heisenberg model@xcite and solved exactly via bethe ansatz . in this case , one finds a gapless metallic phase for @xmath18 and a gapped charge - ordered state for larger values of @xmath13 . for @xmath17 model on a two - leg ladder",
    ", it was found from renomalization group calculations that contrary to a single chain , the ladder becomes a mott insulator for arbitrarily small repulsive interactions @xmath13@xcite . by using the density matrix renormalization group method ,",
    "vojta@xcite et .",
    "al . studied the extended hubbard model for two - leg ladders in the large @xmath12 limit .",
    "they found that the charge - ordered phase vanishes for @xmath19 but claimed that there will be a charge gap for all values of @xmath20 .",
    "for a square lattice , mckenzie@xcite et al . argued from slave - boson theory that the insulating phase with charge order is destroyed below a critical value @xmath13 of order @xmath21 and the system becomes metallic .    here",
    "we will study the @xmath17 model on the checkerboard lattice at half - filling ( one electron per two sites ) with the aim to find out about possible mi and co transitions in this frustrated lattice which is a 2d model for the pyrochlore lattice .",
    "at first we will employ the green s function method and various decoupling schemes within the single - site representation .",
