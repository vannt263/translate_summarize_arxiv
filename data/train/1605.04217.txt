    "formally , for simplicity and without loss of generality , our model consists of two networks @xmath4 and @xmath5 with @xmath6 nodes in each network ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . within network @xmath4 the nodes",
    "are randomly connected by @xmath4 links with degree distribution @xmath7 , while in network @xmath5 the nodes are randomly connected by @xmath5 links with degree distribution @xmath8 . in addition , a fraction @xmath9 of nodes in @xmath4 are randomly dependent ( through dependency links ) on nodes in network @xmath5 and a fraction @xmath10 of nodes in network @xmath5 are randomly dependent on nodes in network @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "we also assume that a node from one network depends on no more than one node from the other network and if a node @xmath11 in network @xmath4 is dependent on a node @xmath12 in network @xmath5 and @xmath12 depends on a node @xmath13 in network @xmath4 , then @xmath14 ( a no - feedback condition @xcite ) .",
    "we denote @xmath15 and @xmath16 as the fractions of nodes that are randomly chosen as reinforced nodes in network @xmath4 and network @xmath5 , respectively . in each network , together with the giant component , those smaller clusters containing at least one reinforced node make up the functioning component , as shown in fig .",
    "the failure process is initiated by removing randomly a fraction @xmath18 of nodes from each network .",
    "therefore when nodes from one network fail their dependent counterparts from the other network must also fail . in this case ,",
    "an autonomous node ( a node that does not need support from the other network ) @xcite survives if it is connected to a functioning component of its own network ; a dependent node @xmath19 survives if both @xmath19 and the node it depends on are connected to their own networks functioning components .",
    "we introduce the generating function of the degree distribution @xmath20 and the associated branching processes @xmath21 @xcite ; similar equations exist to describe network @xmath5 . at the steady state , using the probabilistic framework @xcite , we denote @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) as the probability that a randomly chosen link in network @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) reaches the functioning component of network @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) at one of its nodes .",
    "thus @xmath22 and @xmath23 satisfy the following self - consistent equations ( see _ si appendix _ , section 2 ) , @xmath24 \\times    \\left\\lbrace1-q_a+pq_a\\left[1-(1-\\rho_b)g_{b0}(1-y)\\right]\\right\\rbrace,\\ ] ] and @xmath25\\times    \\left\\lbrace1-q_b+pq_b\\left[1-(1-\\rho_a)g_{a0}(1-x)\\right]\\right\\rbrace.\\ ] ] these two equations can be transformed into @xmath26 and @xmath27 , which can be solved numerically by iteration with the proper initial values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "accordingly , the sizes of the functioning components are determined by ( see _ si appendix _ , section 2 ) @xmath28\\times \\left\\lbrace1-q_a+pq_a[1-(1-\\rho_b)g_{b0}(1-y)]\\right\\rbrace,\\ ] ] and @xmath29\\times   \\left\\lbrace1-q_b+pq_b[1-(1-\\rho_a)g_{a0}(1-x)]\\right\\rbrace.\\ ] ] if the system has an abrupt phase transition at @xmath30 , the functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 satisfy the condition @xmath31 namely , the curves @xmath32 and @xmath33 touch each other tangentially at @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "for a general system of interdependent networks @xmath4 and @xmath5 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and the existence of @xmath37 can be easily determined numerically , using eqs .",
    "[ system1x]-[1storder ] . as an example , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the excellent agreement between simulation and theory .",
    "however it is important to find analytic expressions for @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , at least for simpler cases , that can serve as a benchmark to better understand simulated solutions of more realistic cases .",
    "thus here , for simplicity , we consider the symmetric case where @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "this symmetry readily implies that @xmath41 , reducing eqs .",
    "[ system1x ] and [ system1y ] to a single equation .",
    "similarly , it renders @xmath42 and transforms eq .",
    "[ 1storder ] to @xmath43 , i.e. , @xmath44 .",
    "using eqs .",
    "[ system1x]-[1storder ] , we derive @xmath37 and @xmath45 rigorously ( see _ si appendix _ , section 3 ) .",
    "surprisingly , we find that even for a system built with a relatively high dependency coupling there exists a specific value @xmath46 that divides the phase diagram into two regimes . specifically , if @xmath47 , the system is subject to abrupt transitions ;",
    "however , if @xmath48 , the abrupt percolation transition is absent in the system because the giant component changes from a first - order phase transition behavior to a second - order phase transition behavior ( see _ si appendix _ , section 3 ) . therefore @xmath46 is the minimum fraction of nodes in each network that need to be reinforced in order to make the interdependent system less risky and free from abrupt transitions .",
    "moreover , @xmath46 satisfies the condition ( see _ si appendix _ , section 3 ) @xmath49 figure  [ fig3 ] shows the existence of @xmath46 for systems of fully interdependent er networks ( @xmath50 ) and scale - free ( sf ) networks ( @xmath51 ) , respectively ; figs .",
    "[ fig3]_a _ and [ fig3]_b _ depict the dramatic behavior change of the functioning components as @xmath52 increases slightly from under @xmath46 to above @xmath46 .",
    "we next solve this critical value @xmath46 as a function of @xmath53 and @xmath54 for two interdependent er networks as ( see _ si appendix _ , section 3.1 ) , @xmath55\\right\\rbrace}{2-\\sqrt{{\\left\\langle k \\right\\rangle ( 1-q)^2}/{2q } } } , \\ ] ] where @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the minimum strength of interdependence required to abruptly collapse the system @xcite .",

    "[ u_arho ] for @xmath61 , we get the critical exponent @xmath62 , defined via @xmath63 with @xmath64 .",

    "[ u_arho ] then @xmath37 corresponding to this @xmath53 and @xmath46 can be computed as ( see _ si appendix _ , section 3.1 ) @xmath66/{\\sqrt{2\\left\\langle k \\right\\rangle       q}},\\label{p_c}\\ ] ] and the size of the functioning component at this @xmath67 is @xmath68/{2\\left\\langle k \\right\\rangle } .\\label{mu}\\ ] ] the behavior of the order parameter @xmath69 near the critical point is defined by the critical exponent @xmath70 , where @xmath71 with @xmath72 if @xmath73 and @xmath74 otherwise ( see _ si , appendix _ , section 3.1.1 and ref .",
    "similar scaling behaviors have been reported in a bootstrap percolation problem @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4]_a _ we plot @xmath46 from eq .",
    "[ u_arho ] as a function @xmath53 for several different values of @xmath75 .",
    "interestingly , at @xmath76 , namely , for two fully interdependent er networks , we find , for all mean degrees , the maximum of @xmath46 to be @xmath77 which is independent of @xmath54 . in fig .",
    "[ fig4]_b _ we plot @xmath46 as a function of @xmath53 for several degree exponents @xmath78 of sf networks .",
    "here @xmath46 increases as @xmath78 increases and takes its maximum @xmath79 at @xmath76 , corresponding to the fully interdependent case , which is the most vulnerable .",
    "thus if the dependency strength @xmath53 is unknown , @xmath79 is the minimal fraction of reinforced nodes , that can prevent catastrophic collapse .",
    "similarly , we obtain @xmath79 as a function of the degree exponent @xmath78 for two fully interdependent sf networks ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5]_a _ ) and @xmath79 as a function of @xmath80 for two fully interdependent rr networks ( see fig .  [ fig5]_b _ ) .",
    "note that as @xmath78 increases , @xmath79 initially increases but later stabilizes at a value determined by @xmath81 as the degree distribution becomes more homogeneous and its network structure becomes the same as that in an rr network with @xmath82 ( see _ si , appendix _ , section 3.2 ) . for rr networks , as @xmath80 increases , @xmath79 initially decreases but later stabilizes at a value close to 0.1756 , since at very large @xmath80 the structure of these rr networks resembles that of er networks with @xmath83 ( see _ si appendix _ , section 3.2 ) .",
    "next we solve @xmath79 of two fully interdependent networks as a function of @xmath84 , where @xmath85 ( see fig .",
    "s10 in _ si appendix _ ,",
    "section 4.1 ) .",
    "we find that in two er networks , as @xmath84 increases , @xmath79 increases and has a maximum at @xmath86 , corresponding to the symmetric case studied above . in the case of rr networks with large @xmath80",
    ", @xmath79 behaves similarly to its counterpart in er networks , peaking around @xmath87 at 0.1756 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5]_b _ ) .",
    "moreover , in the case of sf networks when @xmath88 $ ] , @xmath89 ; whereas when @xmath78 and @xmath81 are relatively large , @xmath79 will also peak around @xmath87 with a value close to that obtained in rr networks .",
    "therefore in the extreme case where @xmath78 and @xmath81 are large , sf networks converge to rr networks with @xmath82 , which further converge to er networks with @xmath90 .",
    "thus in these extreme cases there exists a universal @xmath79 equal to 0.1756 ( see _ si appendix _ , section 4.2 ) .",
    "our approach can be generalized to solve the case of tree - like networks of networks ( non ) @xcite .",
    "for example , we study the symmetric case of an er non with @xmath91 fully interdependent member networks and obtain @xmath92 which is independent of the average degree @xmath75 ( see _ si appendix _ , section 3.1.2 ) .",
    "this relationship indicates that the bigger @xmath91 is , the larger @xmath79 should be , which is consistent with the previous finding that the more networks an non has , the more vulnerable it will be @xcite .",
    "we next test our mathematical framework on an empirical network , the us power grid ( pg ) @xcite , with the introduction of a small fraction of reinforced nodes .",
    "it is difficult to establish the exact structure of the network , that pg interacts with , and their interdependencies due to lack of data .",
    "however , to get qualitative insight into the problem we couple the pg with either er or sf networks which can be regarded as approximations to many real - world networks . our motivation is to test how our model performs in the interdependent networks system with some real - world network features . note that here , our results present cascading failures due to structural failures and do not represent failures due to real dynamics , such as cascading failures due to overloads , that appear in power grid network system .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] compares the mutual percolation of two systems of interdependent networks with the same interdependence strength : pg coupled to a same sized er network ( fig .",
    "[ fig6]_a _ ) and pg coupled to a same sized sf network ( fig .",
    "[ fig6]_b _ ) . as discussed above , for @xmath52 below a certain critical value",
    "@xmath46 the systems will undergo abrupt transitions , whereas for @xmath52 above @xmath46 the systems do not undergo any transition at all .",
    "we also find that , for the interdependence strength @xmath93 shown here , the @xmath46 value of the latter case is very small and close to 0.02 ( fig .",
    "[ fig6]_b _ ) .",
    "in summary , we have developed a general percolation framework for studying interdependent networks by introducing a fraction of reinforced nodes at random .",
    "we show that the introduction of a relatively small fraction of reinforced nodes , @xmath46 , can avoid abrupt collapse and thus enhance its robustness . by comparing @xmath46 in er , sf and rr networks ,",
    "we reveal the close relationship between these snetwork structures of these networks in extreme cases and find the universal upper bound for @xmath46 to be 0.1756 .",
    "we also observe improved robustness in systems with some real - world network structure features .",
    "the framework presented here might offer some useful suggestions on how to design robust interdependent networks .",
