    "an essential step in the calculation of @xmath1 with the wilson quark action is the resolution of the mixing problem of the @xmath0 four - quark operators , which is made difficult by the chiral symmetry breaking effects of the wilson term .",
    "an apparent deficiency of perturbation theory for this problem has been well known@xcite , and most calculations have tried to resolve the mixing non - perturbatively with the aid of chiral perturbation theory@xcite .",
    "this method , however , has not been successful , since it contains large systematic uncertainties from higher order effects which survive even in the continuum limit . recently the method of non - perturbative renormalization@xcite has yielded a @xmath0 operator with a good chiral behavior@xcite . however , the underlying mechanism of improvement in this approach is not quite apparent .",
    "our aim is to calculate @xmath1 with a method which explicitly incorporates the chiral properties of the wilson action , and to examine whether the result is consistent with that using the kogut - susskind action . in this report",
    "we propose a non - perturbative method to resolve the operator mixing problem based on chiral ward identities(wi ) , and report first results of a calculation of @xmath1 carried out on vpp500/80 at kek .",
    "let us consider a set of weak operators in the continuum @xmath2 which closes under chiral rotation @xmath3 .",
    "the continuum operators are given by a linear combination of a set of lattice operators @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "we choose the mixing coefficients @xmath6 such that the green s functions of @xmath2 with quarks in the external states satisfy the relevant chiral ward identities to @xmath7 .",
    "the identities can be derived in a standard manner@xcite and take the form given by +   + @xmath8 + @xmath9(1 ) + @xmath10 +   + with @xmath11 the momentum of external quark .",
    "the four - quark operator relevant for @xmath1 may be schematically written as @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "together with @xmath15 , it forms a minimal set which closes under @xmath16 chiral rotation .",
    "the mixing pattern of these operators takes the form @xmath17=@xmath18 and @xmath19 where the lattice operators in the fierz eigenbasis are given by @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "let us take four external quarks with an equal momentum @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath27 and @xmath28 be the sum of green s function on the left hand side of ( 1 ) with external quark legs amputated . using the projection operator @xmath29 corresponding to @xmath30 , we can write @xmath31 and @xmath32 . we then have six equations for the five coefficients @xmath33 , +   + @xmath34 +   + for @xmath35",
    ". we may choose five equations to exactly vanish on the right hand side .",
    "in the present analysis our choice is @xmath36 .",
    "the remaining overall factor @xmath37 is determined by the non - perturbative renormalization method of ref .",
    "we convert final results for matrix elements into those of the @xmath38 scheme with naive dimensional regularization ( ndr ) in the continuum at the renormalization scale @xmath39gev .",
    "in table 1 we summarize parameters of our simulations .",
    "the lattice spacing is estimated from @xmath40 . at each @xmath41",
    "we employ four values of the hopping parameter such that the physical point for the @xmath42 meson can be interpolated from data .",
    "we take degenerate @xmath43 and @xmath44 quark masses , and estimate @xmath45 from @xmath46 .    for calculating green s functions in ward identities",
    "quark propagators are solved in the landau gauge for point source at the origin with the periodic boundary condition .",
    "we extract @xmath1 from a fit of plateau of the ratio of @xmath47-@xmath48 green s function of @xmath49 divided by the vacuum saturation of the @xmath50 operator . for this calculation quark propagators",
    "are solved without gauge fixing for wall source at the edges of lattice using the dirichlet boundary condition in the time direction .",

    "in fig .  1 a representative result for the mixing coefficients is plotted as a function of external quark momenta .",
    "data show only a weak scale dependence in the range @xmath51 .",
    "we take values of coefficients at @xmath52gev , which falls within this range for our runs at @xmath53 , in the following analysis .",
    "we note that non - zero values for @xmath54 contrasts with the one - loop perturbative result @xmath55 .",
    "other coefficients agree in sign , albeit larger in magnitude , and approach perturbative values as @xmath41 increases .",
    "we show in fig .  2 the @xmath56 dependence of the ratio @xmath57 extrapolated to @xmath58 , which measures the contribution of chiral symmetry breaking terms .",
    "results are plotted both for our method ( wi ) and with tadpole - improved one - loop perturbation theory ( pt ) .",
    "the scalar density @xmath59 in the denominator is perturbatively renormalized for both cases . a significant improvement achieved with the use of ward identities",
    "is clearly seen , the ratio becoming consistent with zero even at lattice spacing as large as @xmath60 .    within the one - loop resolution of operator mixing chiral breaking effects",
    "are expected to appear as terms of @xmath61 and @xmath7 .",
    "a roughly linear behavior of the pt values is consistent with the presence of the @xmath7 term .",
    "also they linearly extrapolate to zero within errors at @xmath56@xmath620 .",
    "this suggests that @xmath61 terms left out in the one - loop treatment are actually small .",
    "our results for @xmath63 are summarized in fig .",
    "the wi method gives reasonable values even at a finite lattice spacing .",
    "errors , however , are large , and a continuum extrapolation is difficult at this stage .    in order to reduce statistical errors at each @xmath41 ,",
    "we employ an alternative method(wi[vs ] ) in which the denominator of the ratio for extracting @xmath1 is estimated from the vacuum saturation of @xmath49 constructed by the wi method .",
    "while this method gives results different from those of wi at @xmath56@xmath640 , the discrepancy is expected to vanish as @xmath56@xmath650 . a linear extrapolation in @xmath56 yields",
    "this is consistent with a recent jlqcd result for the kogut - susskind action , @xmath67@xcite .",
    "the tadpole - improved one - loop results ( pt ) , if extrapolated linearly in @xmath56 , give @xmath1(ndr , 2gev)=0.59(10 ) , which agrees well those obtained with the wi or wi[vs ] method .",
    "uncertainties associated with a large extrapolation has to be resolved for assessing the reliability of this approach , however .    in conclusion our results for @xmath1",
    "demonstrates the effectiveness of the method of chiral ward identities for constructing the @xmath68 operator with the correct chiral property .",
    "this makes us hopeful to achieve the goal of a precision determination of @xmath1 with the wilson quark action with further improvement of our simulations ."
