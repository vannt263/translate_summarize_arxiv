    "the distinction between disks and spheroids is one of the defining properties of galaxies . determining the relative importance of these two basic types of galactic component is fundamental to a broad characterization of the galaxy population . yet , this is a complicated task which requires not only high quality imaging for large samples , but also software capable of decomposing the light from each object into a disk and a spheroid .",
    "the determination of spheroid luminosities has recently received even more prominence since the discovery that perhaps all galaxies harbour a supermassive black hole at their centre whose mass is proportional to the luminosity of the spheroid or bulge @xcite .    from a theoretical point of view , explaining why most of the stars in the universe end up either in disks or in spheroids and understanding the physical processes that result in the formation of one or the other of these morphological structures is a major challenge .",
    "the current theoretical framework used to investigate galaxy formation is the cold dark matter model ( peebles 1982 , blumenthal et al .",
    "1984 , davis et al .",
    "1985 ) , in which galaxies build up hierarchically . within this model",
    ", the basic processes thought to be responsible for the distinction between disks and spheroids were identified over twenty years ago ( fall 1979 , frenk et al .",
    "1985 ) : disks result from the collapse of rotating gas cooling within dark matter halos whereas spheroids result from major mergers or disk instabilities @xcite .",
    "the traditional categories of galaxy morphology , spirals , irregulars , etc , are too detailed for current theoretical models to explain , but the relative luminosities and stellar masses of spheroids and disks can readily be predicted @xcite .",
    "thus , accurate measurements of these quantities , for example , as a function of absolute magnitude and in different environments provides a powerful test of models of galaxy formation and evolution .    an early attempt to determine the relative contributions of spheroids and disks to the luminosity density of the universe",
    "was made by .",
    "they studied a magnitude limited sample of @xmath1 galaxies brighter than @xmath2 , drawn from the catalogue of , and determined spheroid - to - disk ratios by visual inspection . from this , they derived the distribution of spheroid - to - disk ratios , as a function of absolute magnitude , and found the overall spheroid - to - disk ratio to be higher in high density environments ( galaxy clusters ) than in low density environments ( the `` field '' )",
    ". found that disks appear to contribute roughly twice as much as spheroids to the mean luminosity density of the universe . since a large fraction of the disk light comes from a relatively small number of young stars , concluded that the relative contribution of spheroid and disk components to the mean stellar mass density of the universe is very nearly equal .",
    "more recently , developed a quantitative method to determine galaxy morphology , specifically to estimate spheroid - to - total ( s / t ) light ratios .",
    "this method is implemented in the code galactica ( galaxy automated component image construction algorithm ) .",
    "analyzed a magnitude - limited sample of @xmath3 field galaxies brighter than @xmath4 and found the luminosity functions of spheroids and disks to be remarkably similar .",
    "they provisionally concluded that spheroids and disks contribute almost equally to the total stellar mass density in the universe but stressed the significant uncertainties in their result arising from the small sample size . a larger sample of 1800 galaxies drawn from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; ) was analyzed by using the publicly available code gim2d .",
    "they found that @xmath5 of the local cosmic luminosity density in both r and i bands comes from disks , @xmath6 from `` pure bulge '' systems and the remaining @xmath7 from bulges in galaxies with detectable disks .    in this paper",
    ", we perform spheroid / disk decompositions from r - band images of a much larger sample of galaxies in the sdss .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in  [ sec : sdss ] , we describe our dataset and how it is processed . in  [ sec : decomp ] , we present results from the spheroid / disk decomposition . in  [ sec : lfs ] , we derive the luminosity functions of disks and spheroids , and present stellar mass functions and also the supermassive black hole mass function . finally , in  [",
    "sec : conc ] , we give our conclusions .",
    "appendices describe extensive tests of the reliability of both galactica and gim2d ( appendix  [ two ] ) , technicalities of the fitting process ( appendix  [ sec : tech ] ) and comparisons of our s / t ratio morphologies with more traditional morphological measures ( appendix  [ sec : bt_morph ] ) . a cosmological model with @xmath8 , @xmath9 is adopted throughout and the hubble constant is defined to be @xmath10kms@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) is the largest imaging and spectroscopic survey to date .",
    "the sdss early data release ( edr ) , made publicly available in 2001 , consists of a @xmath12 square degree area imaged in five passbands ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) and also covered spectroscopically .",
    "the sdss edr galaxy catalogue is spectroscopically complete down to @xmath15 and contains measurements of various galaxy parameters @xcite .",
    "the imaging data were taken with a dedicated @xmath16 m telescope in the drift - scan ( time - delay ) integration mode with an effective exposure time of @xmath17s .",
    "the data used in this study are the @xmath18-band imaging frames with corrections for bias , flat field , cosmic ray and pixel defects @xcite .",
    "each imaging frame is a @xmath19 pixel array with a pixel size of @xmath20 .",
    "measured spheroid - to - total ( s / t ) light ratios for the field galaxy sample of using @xmath21-band imaging .",
    "the data were originally obtained to determine the @xmath22-band luminosity function and showed that they could be used reliably to estimate s / t ratios for galaxies brighter than @xmath23 with an rms accuracy of @xmath24 .",
    "unfortunately , the area covered by this sample is rather small ( 4.4 deg@xmath25 ) .",
    "the sdss imaging data were obtained with a larger telescope but using shorter exposure times than those of . from monte - carlo simulations , established the signal - to - noise required to obtain reliable measurements of s / t using the galactica decomposition code . assuming that , when applied to the sdss data , the code will be reliable to the same overall signal - to - noise level , we find that the limiting magnitude required for our sdss sample is @xmath26 . using the mean galaxy colours of , the transformation between the @xmath27 and @xmath18 bands is @xmath28 , making the total difference equal to @xmath29 magnitudes .",
    "we therefore select edr galaxies with @xmath30this is 1.4 magnitudes fainter than the sample used in a similar study by .",

    "this cut on of the seeing is used to impose a second galaxy selection criterion since reliable spheroid - to - disk decompositions require that the seeing be less than a typical galaxy half - light radius @xcite .",
    "the final galaxy selection criterion is redshift . to avoid contamination of the measured redshift by the local galaxy infall velocity , a low redshift cut , @xmath37 ,",
    "is imposed . since the total sdss sample begins to tail off at large distance , a high redshift cut , @xmath38 ,",
    "was also imposed .",

    ", the galaxy coordinates were accumulated in @xmath40 bins . all the areas which contain at least one galaxy residing in a particular bin",
    "were summed to give the total solid angle .",

    "the solid angle subtended by our sample is @xmath41 square degrees .",
    "object detection was performed using sextractor v2.2.2 @xcite .",
    "the sextractor world coordinates of the object centroid positions ( @xmath42 ) were used to identify the catalogued galaxies within the sdss frames .",
    "the galactica code ( appendix  [ fitg ] ) was run on the extracted postage stamps whose size was set equal to @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the petrosian radius ( lupton et al .",
    "this is large enough to contain many background pixels but sufficiently small to ensure a reasonable convergence time for the fitting procedure .",
    "prior to decomposition , the sextractor estimate of the local sky background was subtracted from every postage - stamp to ensure that the background level was close to zero ( see appendix  [ two ] ) .",
    "before beginning the decomposition procedure , it is necessary to ensure that the psf analytic model assumed by the galactica code ( appendix  [ fitg ] ) is a realistic representation of the sdss psf . to demonstrate that the sdss stars are well represented by the analytic moffat profile assumed by the galactica code",

    "( 2002 ) developed a monte carlo approach to estimate the errors on the fitted parameters in galactica .",
    "this method is very time consuming , requiring several cpu days for a typical galaxy .",
    "a full monte carlo analysis is therefore impractical for a large dataset such as the one in this paper . instead , to obtain representative error estimates",
    ", we split the sample into bins of apparent magnitude of width @xmath48 , and selected from each of these bins @xmath49 galaxies from each of three further bins in s / t ( @xmath50s / t@xmath51 , @xmath52s / t@xmath53 , @xmath54s / t@xmath55 ) .",
    "the full monte carlo analysis was performed on the selected subsample and the medians of the derived errors taken to be representative for galaxies in each @xmath56 $ ] bin .",
    "it has long been known that galaxy colour is a useful indicator of whether a galaxy is elliptical ( old , red ) or spiral ( young , blue ) @xcite since the dominant stellar populations are reflected in the galaxy colours . investigating the colour - magnitude and colour - colour diagrams ,",
    "have shown that the ( @xmath57 ) colour distribution of sdss galaxies has two maxima which are separated by a well - defined minimum at @xmath58 and that @xmath59 of galaxies spectroscopically classified as ` early ' types have @xmath60 whilst @xmath61 of spectroscopically classified ` late ' types have @xmath62 .",
    "have also shown that this separator also applies for a subsample of visually classified morphological types where @xmath63 of galaxies visually classified as e , s0 or sa have colours redder than @xmath58 and @xmath64 of galaxies visually classified as sb , sc and irr have colours bluer than @xmath58 .",

    ". however , the red galaxies in particular span a large range in s / t ratio .",
    "this suggests that blue star - forming galaxies are predominantly disk - dominated but that disk - dominated galaxies include both star - forming ( blue ) and passive ( red ) galaxies      galaxies can also be classified according to how ` peaky ' their light distribution is by using the concentration index @xcite .",
    "the surface brightness distribution of ellipticals and s0s is considerably more centrally concentrated than that of spirals and irregulars .",
    "defined the ( inverse ) concentration index for sdss galaxies as the ratio of the half- to the @xmath71 light radii and define an optimum division between late and early types to be at @xmath72 ( with @xmath73 contamination from opposite types ) .",
