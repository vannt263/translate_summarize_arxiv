    "as progress has extended perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) beyond leading order , theoretical comparisons of a more detailed nature are being performed with experimental data .",
    "the advent of both next  to  leading order ( nlo ) and leading  log approximations ( lla ) has enabled predictions for both event topologies involving more than two jets and the internal structure within a jet .",
    "this paper reports on two such studies , one involving a detailed examination of the transverse energy flow within jets and the other involving the first study of azimuthal decorrelation of jets with large separations in pseudorapidity .    in both studies , nlo qcd is the first order in which a theoretical prediction is possible . although nlo predictions have been successful in describing inclusive single jet and dijet  @xcite cross sections , deviations from the measured distributions or a large sensitivity to the choice of renormalization scale may indicate large higher order corrections . in this case",
    ", an all  orders approximation in the form of a lla may produce better results .",
    "for the jet shape analysis , a model where only one additional radiated parton is allowed may prove inadequate to reproduce all aspects of the transverse energy flow .",
    "additional fragmentation effects may indeed be important . in jet production with large rapidity separations , the presence of multiple scales in the calculation may require a resummation .",
    "two alternative methods are explored , one resumming @xmath3 via dglap  @xcite splitting functions and the other resumming @xmath4 using the bfkl  @xcite equation .",
    "a comparison of experimental results to theoretical predictions will determine the necessity of including such higher order corrections .",
    "the data for this study  @xcite were collected using the d  detector which is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the critical components for this study are the uranium  liquid argon calorimeters .",
    "these calorimeters provide hermetic coverage over most of the solid angle with a transverse segmentation of @xmath5 in @xmath6 ( @xmath7 $ ] , where @xmath8 is the polar angle with respect to the proton beam and @xmath9 is the azimuthal angle ) .",
    "the measured resolutions are @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( e in gev ) for electromagnetic and single hadronic showers respectively .",
    "the data were collected using four separate triggers , each requiring a minimum @xmath12 in a specified number of trigger towers ( @xmath13 in @xmath14 ) at the hardware level .",
    "events satisfying these requirements were sent to a processor farm where a fast version of the offline jet algorithm searched for jet candidates above some @xmath12 threshold .",
    "these events were used to populate four non - overlapping jet @xmath12 ranges : 45 - 70 , 70 - 105 , 105 - 140 , and @xmath15 gev .",
    "each trigger was used only where it was fully efficient .",
    "jets were reconstructed offline using an iterative fixed cone algorithm with a radius r = 1.0 in @xmath16 space .",
    "the final jet angles were defined as follows : @xmath17 and @xmath18 with @xmath19 in the beam direction and the sums extending over calorimeter towers whose centers were contained within the jet cone .",
    "these definitions differ from the snowmass algorithm  @xcite : @xmath20 and @xmath21 . in both cases ,",
    "the @xmath2 of the jet was defined as @xmath22 . after a preliminary set of jets",
    "was found , overlapping jets were redefined .",
    "two jets were merged into one jet if more than 50% of the @xmath12 of the jet with the smaller @xmath12 was contained in the overlap region .",
    "the direction of the new jet was defined as the vector sum of the two original jet momenta , and the energy was recalculated .",
    "if less than 50% of the @xmath12 was contained in the overlap region , the jets were split into two distinct jets . in this case , the energy of each calorimeter cell in the overlap region was assigned to the nearest jet and the jet directions were recalculated .",
    "two different @xmath23 regions ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) were studied .    for this study",
    "we define the quantity @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is the number of jets in the sample ) which is the average fraction of the jet transverse energy contained in a subcone of radius @xmath28 . for a given value of @xmath28 ,",
    "a larger value of @xmath29 represents a narrower jet .",
    "individual subcones were corrected for underlying event and noise effects only .    in fig .",
    "[ js 1 ] , the average @xmath2 fraction ( @xmath29 ) versus the subcone radius is shown for the two different @xmath23 regions for jets between 45 and 70 gev @xmath2 .",
    "also shown in this figure are the predictions from herwig  @xcite , a monte carlo prediction which incorporates higher order effects through a parton shower model .",
    "detector effects were modeled using a detailed detector simulation based on geant  @xcite . although properly describing the qualitative behavior of the data , in both the central and forward regions the theoretical predictions are narrower than the measured jet shapes . in order to remove detector effects ,",
    "correction factors were determined using three different event generators , comparing the jet shape before and after detector simulation . in the subsequent distributions ,",
    "the detector effects have been removed using these correction factors .    in fig .",
    "[ js 2 ] , the jet shape for the four different @xmath12 regions are shown for central jets ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "we see that as the @xmath2 of the jet increases , a larger fraction of its total @xmath2 is contained in the inner subcones , i.e. the jets are narrower .",
    "this result is in good agreement with cdf  @xcite measurements ( fig .",
    "[ js 4 ] ) where jet shapes were determined using charged particle tracks only . in fig .",
    "[ js 3 ] , the jet shape for a single @xmath2 range in both the central and the forward @xmath23 region is shown .",
    "we see that jets of the same @xmath2 become narrower as the jets become more forward .    also shown in figs .  [ js 2 ] and",
    "[ js 3 ] is a comparison to nlo qcd predictions made with jetrad  @xcite using cteq2 m  @xcite parton distribution functions ( pdf ) and three different renormalization scales(@xmath30 ) : @xmath31 , @xmath2 , and @xmath32 .",
    "studies showed the theoretical predictions were insensitive to choices in pdf .",
    "since this is a nlo qcd prediction containing at most three partons in the final state , jet shape arises from combining two final state partons into one jet . for this study ,",
    "two partons were considered to constitute one jet if their distance in @xmath23 ",
    "@xmath9 space from their vector sum was less than one . using the d  definitions of jet angles ,",
    "central jets are found to be generally wider than predicted by jetrad .",
    "forward jets are narrower than predicted and the observed narrowing of forward jets with increasing @xmath2 is not reproduced by jetrad .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ js 3 ] , using the snowmass definition of jet angles generally improves the agreement between data and predictions .",
    "while the experimental jet shape distribution is only moderately affected by the choice of jet angle definition , the theoretical prediction in the forward region is very sensitive to this choice .",
    "qualitatively , the nlo calculations using the snowmass algorithm describe the measured jet shapes reasonably well .",
    "however , these predictions , being the first order in which a nontrivial jet shape emerges , show large sensitivity to the choice of renormalization scale with no single choice able to describe the data at all @xmath2 s .",
    "in this study  @xcite we are interested in jets widely separated in pseudorapidity and at relatively low @xmath2 . by measuring the @xmath9 correlation of the dijet system we gain information about the radiation pattern in the event .",
    "the data used for this study were collected in a similar fashion to the jet shape study . in this case , a single trigger was used .",
    "it required @xmath33 gev at the hardware level and searched for jet candidates with an @xmath2 threshold of 30 gev in the processor farm .",
    "offline , jets were reconstructed using an iterative fixed cone algorithm with a radius of r = 0.7 in @xmath16 space .",
    "both the final jet angles and the merging and splitting criteria were defined as described above .    from the sample of jets collected with @xmath34 gev and @xmath35 ,",
    "the two jets at the extremes of pseudorapidity were selected . to remove any trigger inefficiencies , one of these two jets",
    "was required to have @xmath36 gev .",
    "the relevant quantities used in this analysis are @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( where the subscripts refer to the two jets described above ) .    since the trigger was implemented out to @xmath35 , the maximum value of @xmath39 is @xmath40 .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ jd 1 ] where we plot the pseudorapidity interval @xmath39 for events passing our cuts . in fig .",
    "[ jd 2 ] , the azimuthal angular separation , @xmath41 is plotted for three selected unit bins of @xmath39 centered at @xmath42 1 , 3 , and 5 .",
    "the correlation of the two jets at the extremes in pseudorapidity is evident in the shape of this distribution which becomes wider ( less correlated ) at @xmath39 increases .",
    "a correlation variable , @xmath43 , has been defined to study the effect quantitatively .",
    "this quantity is plotted in fig .",
    "[ jd 3 ] as a function of @xmath39",
    ". for the data , the error bars represent the statistical and uncorrelated systematic errors added in quadrature .",
    "an error band at the bottom of the plot represents the correlated systematic error due to the energy scale and detector effects .",
    "also shown in fig .",
    "[ jd 3 ] are the theoretical predictions from herwig , nlo qcd as implemented in jetrad , and bfkl resummation  @xcite .",
    "the errors for the predictions are statistical only .    for the data , many sources of systematic error were investigated . for all values of @xmath39",
    "the energy scale error dominates , except for @xmath44 , where the measurement is statistically limited .",
    "other systematic errors due to the out  of  cone showering correction , angular biases present in the jet reconstruction , and our selection cuts are included .",
    "although no attempt was made to correct back for detector effects , the size of any such effects was estimated using herwig events that were subjected to a detailed simulation of our detector based on geant .",
    "the size of the effect was negligible for @xmath45 and only @xmath46 at @xmath47 and are included in the systematic correlated error band .",
    "systematic effects were also studied in the theory .",
    "the renormalization and factorization scale @xmath30 was varied in the nlo prediction from @xmath48 to @xmath49 .",
    "the largest variation seen in @xmath50 was less than 0.026 .",
    "different parton distribution functions were used ( cteq2 m , mrsd@xmath51  @xcite , and grv  @xcite ) resulting in variations of less than 0.003 .",
    "in addition , the monte carlo study was repeated using the snowmass jet angle definitions .",
    "the difference in @xmath50 was less than 0.013 .",
    "as a cross check , a subset of the data was analyzed using the snowmass jet angle definitions as well .",

    "[ jd 3 ] show a nearly linear decorrelation effect with pseudorapidity . for small @xmath39",
    "both herwig and jetrad describe the data well",
    ". however , at large @xmath39 jetrad , which is leading order in describing any decorrelation effect , shows deviations from the measurement predicting too little decorrelation .",
    "the bfkl predictions , valid for large @xmath52 , are shown for @xmath53 .",
    "as the pseudorapidity interval increases , this leading  log approximation predicts too much decorrelation .",
    "the herwig prediction , which includes higher order processes in the form of a parton shower model including angular ordering , describes the data well over the entire @xmath39 region .",
    "we have presented results on both jet shapes and azimuthal decorrelation in dijet systems .",
    "these results have been compared to various theoretical predictions .",
    "we see that jets become narrower as their @xmath2 increases for a fixed @xmath23 and that they become narrower as their @xmath23 increases for fixed @xmath2 .",
