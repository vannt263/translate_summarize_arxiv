    "the recent advances in detector technology in the near - infrared ( hereafter nir ) domain have brought much enthusiasm to the field of large - scale structure of the universe . indeed , nir light has the strong advantage of being much less affected by extinction from dust grains , than is optical light , and as such",
    ", near - infrared galaxy images show spiral galaxies in a much simpler light , traced by their old stellar populations , with little dust obscuration in spiral arms and in the galaxy centres ( zaritsky , rix & rieke 1993 ; hraudeau , simien & mamon 1996 ) .",
    "moreover , nir emission is less affected by recent bursts of star formation within a galaxy , that can result in relatively small numbers of new hot ob stars contributing a substantial fraction of the optical light of the entire galaxy .",
    "finally , the transparency of dust grains to nir photons means that our own galaxy will not obscure the view of external galaxies imaged in the nir .",
    "however , within a few degrees from the galactic plane , confusion from stars sets in and prevents reliable star / galaxy separation ( e.g. jarrett et al .",
    ".    for these reasons , tracing the distribution of mass in the universe with galaxies becomes much more meaningful if the galaxies are selected in the nir domain .",
    "two very large nir digital imaging surveys , denis ( e.g. epchtein et al .",
    "1999 ) and 2mass ( e.g. jarrett et al .",
    "2000a ) , are producing galaxy catalogues that are essential for such cosmological studies in two dimensions .",
    "moreover , there is much science to be gained by using redshifts to give a third dimension . with this in mind",
    ", we have approval to use the soon to be commissioned 6df robotic multi - fibre spectroscope ( parker , watson & miziarski 1998 ; watson et al .",
    "2000 ) on the ukst to undertake the massive 6df galaxy redshift survey ( hereafter 6dfgrs , e.g. mamon 1998 , 1999 ; see also http://msowww.anu.edu.au/~colless/6df ) of roughly @xmath11 galaxies selected from 2mass and denis .",
    "this large survey is scheduled to begin in the southern autumn of 2001 .    in a pilot study of 6dfgrs",
    ", we tested the feasibility of measuring redshifts with optical spectroscopy of nir - selected galaxy samples .",
    "for this , we observed two schmidt - plate sized fields of galaxies , selected in the @xmath0 ( 1.25@xmath12 m ) band with early denis observations .",
    "the spectroscopy was performed at the ukst with the flair ii multi - fibre instrument ( e.g. parker & watson 1995 ) , which has now been decommissioned pending the introduction of the automated 6df .",
    "the results of this pilot study are reported in the present paper .",
    "galaxies were selected from preliminary denis extractions performed during february 1998 , with a galaxy pipeline , based upon sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) and a simple preliminary star / galaxy separation algorithm based upon a threshold of the ratio of peak intensity to isophotal area ( @xmath13 ) , which , to first order , does not depend on magnitude ( mamon et al .",
    "this star / galaxy separation is performed in the denis-@xmath14 band , which is much more sensitive and has better spatial resolution than the denis-@xmath0 or @xmath15 bands .",
    "the target galaxy samples were taken from the contiguous denis strips that overlap regions of ukst standard survey fields f787 ( 12h00 , @xmath16 ) at high galactic latitude ( @xmath17 ) , and f20 ( 12h00 , @xmath18 ) at low galactic latitude ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "all objects in denis _ strips _ of 180 consecutive images at constant ra crossing these fields , with @xmath3 , and below _ or slightly above _ the star / galaxy separation ( @xmath13 ) threshold ( which depends on the denis strip ) were selected .",
    "the @xmath0 photometry is based upon the kron ( 1980 ) estimator of the total flux of galaxies .",
    "the internal photometric errors , based upon multiple observations of single objects , are @xmath20 at @xmath21 ( mamon et al .",
    "we made use of an early photometric calibration that is estimated to be accurate to better than @xmath22 .",
    "note that our samples do not provide full coverage of the two ukst fields , as only a fraction of denis strips ( 11 out of 30 for field f787 and 5 out of 27 for field f20 ) had been observed at the time of the observations .",
    "we ended up with 87 candidate objects in field f787 , of which 84 were below the star / galaxy separation threshold .",
    "field f20 turned out to be heavily obscured by the chameleon cloud , and only 33 objects were extracted , all above the star / galaxy separation threshold ( i.e. as galaxies according to denis ) .",
    "we did not target objects that were obvious stars , as well as objects that lied close to others , because of constraints on the minimum fibre separation , leaving us with 78 targeted objects in field f787 and 32 objects in field f20 .",
    "for all objects , @xmath23 magnitudes were extracted from the roe / nrl ukst cosmos catalog ( hereafter cosmos ) .",
    "the cross - identification was performed with a @xmath24 search radius for galaxies in astrometrically calibrated denis strips ( strip number greater than 5000 ) , and with a @xmath25 search radius otherwise . in nearly all cases , the denis and cosmos astrometries matched to within @xmath26 ( even among the non - calibrated denis images ) .",
    "all cases with no matches within @xmath26 were inspected visually on denis and digitized sky survey ( hereafter , dss ) images . in field f787 ,",
    "6 objects had astrometric matches within @xmath27 to @xmath28 . in field f20 ,",
    "one object with no astrometric match turned out to be a false denis detection , caused by a nearby very bright and saturated star .",
    "3 objects had cosmos counterparts within @xmath27 to @xmath29 and one object had its cosmos counterpart at @xmath30 .",
    "comparison with the dss showed that the astrometric offsets were caused by the lack of calibration of many of the denis images .",
    "in particular , the mismatch of @xmath30 was caused by the poor telescope pointing caused by a large camera flexure at the end of a polar denis strip , with the telescope operating at large zenith angle .",
    "the spectroscopic observations were performed with the flair  ii 92-fibre spectrograph at the ukst schmidt telescope at siding spring .",
    "the telescope has @xmath31 diameter aperture , and uses @xmath32 fibres .",
    "we made use of the low spectral resolution 250b grating , with a spectral resolution of @xmath33 , observing in the spectral range @xmath34 .",
    "the spectrograph is described in detail in parker & watson ( 1995 ) .",
    "the fibres of the plate - holders were configured , off telescope , during day - time , with about 11 fibres reserved for sky - background measures to facilitate sky - subtraction .",

    "figure  7 shows the distribution of absolute @xmath0 magnitudes in field f787 .",
    "a wilcoxon rank - sum test indicates over 97% probability that the @xmath0-band luminosities of elgs are , on average , lower than those of nelgs .",
    "[ nvsmj ]    a qualitatively similar trend of increasing fraction of elgs with decreasing luminosity has been reported by tresse et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for the optically selected stromlo - apm sample .",
    "compared to the optical , one expects a stronger trend of elg fraction versus absolute magnitude in the near - infrared , because elgs are intrinsically blue ( see fig . 6 ) .",
    "we have attempted to evaluate the @xmath0-band galaxy luminosity function for the 63 galaxies with @xmath3 of the high galactic latitude field f787 , using the simplest methods given in willmer ( 1997 ) . because of the small number of galaxies , we restrain ourselves to the sty ( sandage , tammann & yahil 1979 ) parametric , maximum likelihood estimator , assuming a schechter ( 1976 ) luminosity function @xmath35 . neglecting magnitude and redshift errors , as well as galactic extinction and the @xmath36 terms ( indeed , @xmath37 for @xmath38 as in our sample , see poggianti 1997 ; mannucci et al .",
    "2001 ) and assuming @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( for the luminosity distances required to convert apparent to absolute magnitudes ) , we derive reasonable maximum likelihood parameters : @xmath41 where the errors are 68% confidence constant likelihood contours equal to the maximum likelihood value offset by the usual @xmath42 . ) . ]",
    "we evaluated the normalisation of the luminosity function using the relation ( e.g. willmer 1997 , sec .",
    "3 ) @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the number density of galaxies ( corrected for the selection function , see willmer 1997 , eq . [ 33 ] ) , evaluated in 10 velocity bins out to @xmath45 ( beyond which our data is too sparse ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath46 where the uncertainty is estimated from the uncertainty of @xmath44 ( thus neglecting the uncertainties in @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) .",
    "our luminosity function parameters ( eqs .",
    "[ [ parsml ] ] and [ [ phistar ] ] ) match well those of cole et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , and our slope @xmath47 and normalisation @xmath49 also match very well that of the optical stromlo - apm survey ( loveday et al .",
    "1992 ) .",
    "figure  [ wedgef787 ] shows the resulting wedge diagrams for field f787 .",
    "note that these wedges are incomplete , as only 11 out of 35 possible denis strips covered the ukst f787 field .",
    "one notices galaxy concentrations at radial velocities near 20000 and @xmath50 , the first of which includes a galaxy that lies within @xmath51 of the abell 1434 cluster , whose redshift is not yet known .    our measurement based upon a single , possibly interloping object gives a tentative @xmath52 for abell 1434 .",
    "if abell 1434 lies at that distance , an angle of @xmath51 corresponds to a physical separation of @xmath53 , which would place object f78737 at the core of the cluster .",
    "inspection of figure  [ wedgef787 ] indicates that the concentration at @xmath50 is for a fairly constant dec and a range of ras , corresponding to a comoving scale of @xmath54 , indicative of a supercluster .",
    "figure  [ wedgef20 ] show the resulting wedge diagrams for field f20 .",
    "concentrations are apparent at @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "this pilot study for the forthcoming 6dfgrs has provided useful information on various aspects of the survey .",
    "first , it has shown that the preliminary galaxy extraction from denis images was highly reliable , even at low galactic latitudes ( @xmath19 ) , where the reliability , based upon subsequent visual inspection of photographic plates was 93% , despite confusion with double stars and extinction .",
    "second , it pointed to a degraded fibre transmission , which has been attended to since .",
    "also a newly commissioned 1k eev ccd for 6df is expected to significantly improve the instrument throughput .",
    "third , it proved that optical spectroscopy of high - latitude , nir - based , samples is feasible with similar rates of successful redshift measurement as in optically - selected galaxy samples .",
    "fourth , it indicated that redshifts can be obtained at low galactic latitude , although with much less success than at high galactic latitude .",
    "there are therefore good reasons to have full confidence in the success of the 6dfgrs in obtaining a highly complete redshift followup of galaxies selected in the nir by 2mass and denis , although this success may be limited to high galactic latitudes .",
    "note that the primary sample of 6dfgrs will be the longer wavelength @xmath57 band at @xmath58 m , and there is expected to be a larger fraction of galaxies with only absorption lines , for which redshifts are generally harder to measure .",
    "moreover , our study has provided a first estimate on the fraction of emission - line galaxies in a @xmath0-band selected galaxy sample and its variation with galaxy @xmath0-band luminosity , as well as an estimate of the @xmath0-band galaxy luminosity function .",
    "serendipitous results include a tentative redshift for the abell 1434 cluster as well as the establishment of various concentrations of galaxies , including a potential supercluster at @xmath59 .",
    "we warmly thank malcolm hartley for operating the ukst telescope , paul cass for fibering one of the plates , and matthew colless and brian boyle for useful discussions and encouragement .",
    "we are very grateful to chris willmer who checked our luminosity functions and ran monte - carlo simulations to check the error estimates .",
    "we also thank santiago arribas and a second anonymous referee for useful comments on the manuscript .",
    "these observations were based upon images taken by the near - infrared imaging survey , which is supported , in france by the institut national des sciences de lunivers , the education ministry and the centre national de la recherche scientifique , in germany by the state of baden - wrtemberg , in spain by the dg1cyt , in italy by the consiglio nazionale delle ricerche , in austria by the fonds zur frderung der wissenschaftlichen forschung und bundesministerium fr wissenshaft und forschung .",
