    "binary msps represent the advanced phase of stellar evolution in close , interacting binaries .",
    "their observed orbital and stellar properties are fossil records of their evolutionary history .",
    "thus one can use binary pulsar systems as key probes of stellar astrophysics .",
    "although the standard recycling scenario ( ( * ? ? ? * alpar  et  al .  1982 ) ;",
    "* bhattacharya  &  van  den  heuvel  1991 ) ) is commonly accepted , many aspects of the mass - transfer process and the accretion physics are still not understood in detail .",
    "examples of such ambiguities include the accretion disk structure , the disk - magnetosphere transition zone , the accretion efficiency , the decay of the surface b - field of the neutron star and the outcome of common envelope evolution .",
    "for further details on these aspects , details in general and discussions of our results , we refer to our journal paper , ..",
    "some of the above mentioned simplifications become a problem when trying to probe the formation and the evolution of observed recycled radio pulsars located near the classical spin - up line for eddington accretion in the @xmath0diagram ( e.g. as illustrated with the msp j1823@xmath13021a , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* freire  et  al .",
    "2011 ) ) . the location of the spin - up line can be found by considering the equilibrium configuration when the angular velocity of the neutron star is equal to the keplerian angular velocity of matter at the magnetospheric boundary ( @xmath2 ) where the accreted matter enters the magnetosphere , i.e. @xmath3 or : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the so - called critical fastness parameter . introducing the magnetospheric coupling radius , @xmath6 and the magnetic inclination angle , @xmath7 we can rewrite this expression : @xmath8 which can be plotted directly in the @xmath0diagram .",
    "( here @xmath9 is the mass of the pulsar , @xmath10 is its accretion rate and @xmath11 is its moment of inertia . ) in case @xmath12 we find : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the equilibrium spin period in units of milliseconds .",
    "we have included the plasma term in the spin - down torque using the combined model of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* spitkovsky  ( 2006 ) ) to compensate for the incompleteness of the vacuum magnetic dipole model .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we have plotted equation  ( [ eq : spinupline ] ) for different values of @xmath7 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 to illustrate the uncertainties in the applied accretion physics to locate the spin - up line . in all cases",
    "we assumed a fixed accretion rate of @xmath17 .",
    "the location of the spin - up line is simply shifted one order of magnitude in @xmath18 down ( up ) for every order of magnitude @xmath10 is decreased ( increased ) .",
    "it is important to realize that there is no universal spin - up line in the @xmath0diagram .",
    "not only are @xmath9 and @xmath7 individual to each pulsar ( giving rise to the width of each band ) , also @xmath15 and @xmath19 could be related to @xmath20 , @xmath7 and @xmath10 .",
    "+ if we assume that accretion onto the neutron star is indeed eddington limited , then the three bands in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] represent upper limits for the spin - up line for the given sets of ( @xmath15 ,  @xmath21 ) .",
    "thus we can in principle use this plot to constrain ( @xmath15 ,  @xmath21 ) and hence the physics of disk  magnetosphere interactions from future detections of msps .    when modeling the birth spins of recycled radio pulsars it is important to include the braking torque acting during the roche - lobe decoupling phase ( rldp ) when the donor star terminates its mass transfer .",
    "it has been shown that accreting x - ray msps may lose up to 50  % of their rotational energy during the rldp of lmxbs ( ( * ? ? ? * tauris  2012 ) ) .",
    "recycled pulsars obtain their fast spins via angular momentum exchange from the differential rotation between the accretion disk and the neutron star .",
    "the amount of spin angular momentum added to an accreting pulsar is given by : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a dimensionless torque . assuming @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 to be roughly constant during the major part of the spin - up phase we can obtain a simple and convenient expression to relate the ( minimum ) amount of accreted mass and final equilibrium spin period",
    "( see also ( * ? ? ? * alpar  et  al .  1982 ) ) : @xmath28 assuming a numerical factor @xmath29 ( from disk - magnetosphere interactions ) .",
    "+ considering a pulsar with a final mass of @xmath30 and a recycled spin period of either 2  ms , 5  ms , 10  ms or 50  ms requires accretion of @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 or @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "therefore , it is no surprise that observed recycled pulsars with massive companions ( co / onemg  wd or ns ) in general are much more slow rotators  compared to msps with he  wd companions  since the progenitor of their massive companions evolved on a relatively short timescale in imxbs or hmxbs , only allowing for very little mass to be accreted by the pulsar .",
    "in order to investigate if we can understand the distribution of msps in the @xmath0diagram we have traced the evolution of eight hypothetical , recycled msps with different birth locations ( @xmath35 ) . in each case we traced the evolution as a function of age , @xmath36 for a constant braking index @xmath37 and calculated isochrones by integration for each pulsar given that @xmath38 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] together with observed data .",
    "furthermore , we plotted two isochrones ( see fat green and pink lines ) calculated for ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) and ( @xmath42 , @xmath40 , @xmath43 ) , respectively , and with no restrictions on @xmath44 ( or @xmath45 ) .    a number of interesting conclusions can be drawn from this diagram .",
    "the overall distribution of observed pulsars follows nicely the banana - like shape of the two fat isochrones , see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kiziltan & thorsett  ( 2010 ) ) , and hence pulsars are recycled with a wide range of final b - fields . although these curves are not an attempt for a best fit to the observations it is interesting to notice that close to 90  % of all recycled pulsars ( even up to @xmath46 ) are compatible with being born ( recycled ) with an initial spin period of @xmath47 and having ages between 1.5 and 12 gyr .",
    "however , from a binary evolution point of view many of the @xmath48 pulsars ( the mildly recycled pulsars ) are born with such relatively slow spins ( see section  [ sec : mass - spin ] ) and hence they need not be that old .",
    "this can , for example , be verified by cooling age determinations of their wd companion stars .",
    "pulsars with small values of the period derivative , @xmath49 hardly evolve at all in the diagram over a hubble time .",
    "this trivial fact is important since it tells us that these pulsars were basically born with their currently observed values of @xmath50 and @xmath18 ( first pointed out by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* camilo  et  al .",
    "hence , some pulsars with characteristic ages of @xmath51 could in principle have been recycled very recently  demonstrating the unreliability of @xmath52 as a true age indicator .",
    "it is also interesting to notice psr  j1801@xmath13210 ( discovered by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bates  et  al .",
    "2011 ) ) which must have been recycled with a relatively slow birth period , @xmath53 despite its low b - field @xmath54 , see fig .",
