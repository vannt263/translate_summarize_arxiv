    "the  forest seen in quasar spectra is now thought to be produced by neutral hydrogen atoms in an intergalactic medium ( igm ) which is in photoionisation equilibrium ( see e.g. , rauch 1998 for a review ) . at low to moderate redshifts ,",
    "the fraction of neutral atoms is small ( 1 in @xmath7 ; e.g. gunn & peterson 1965 ) but knowledge of the photoionisation rate ( from summing the contribution of known sources ; e.g. haardt & madau 1996 ) makes it possible to extrapolate from this one part in a million measurement to an estimate of the total baryon density @xmath8 ( weinberg 1997 , rauch 1997 ) .",
    "loeb ( 1996 ) has argued that the ionised component of the igm should be directly observable by inverse compton or doppler scattering of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons by free electrons ( sunyaev - zeldovich [ 1972,1980 ] ; hereafter , the sz effect ) .",
    "such a detection would provide consistency checks on the currently favoured cosmological model for structure formation , and place constraints on the igm density , temperature , ionisation state and velocity field . in this paper , we use a hydrodynamic cosmological simulation to investigate how observations of the cmb temperature and  spectra of quasars drawn from the same region of sky can be used in the search for the hitherto unseen @xmath9 of the hydrogen associated with the  forest gas at redshifts @xmath10 .    in favoured models for structure formation , the optical depth for  forest absorption arises in a continuously fluctuating medium ( e.g. , cen 1994 ; zhang , anninos , & norman 1995 ; petitjean , mcket , & kates 1995 ; hernquist 1996 ; katz 1996a ; wadsley & bond 1997 ; theuns 1998 ; dav et al .",
    "the density of neutral hydrogen is inversely proportional to the photoionisation rate @xmath11 : @xmath12 and the optical depth to absorption is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the  oscillator strength , @xmath15 is the neutral hydrogen number density , and @xmath16   ( gunn and peterson 1965 ) .",
    "in order for @xmath17 be of order unity , ( as seen , for example at redshifts @xmath18 ) , @xmath15 must be much smaller than the total density of hydrogen atoms , as noted earlier .",
    "the gas in photoionisation equilibrium lies at densities @xmath19 times the mean , and obeys a power law relationship between density and temperature ( gnedin & hui 1998 ) . at @xmath3 , according to hydrodynamic simulations ( dav 2001 ) , more than @xmath20 of the baryons are expected to be in this diffuse component .",
    "the tiny neutral fraction is readily detectable , but not the dominant ionised portion of the material . owing to gravitational evolution , at @xmath21 most of the baryons",
    "are expected to reside in a shock heated igm , with little neutral hydrogen ( cen & ostriker 1999 , dav 2001 ) .",
    "the interaction of cmb photons with free electrons in the intergalactic plasma was first considered by sunyaev and zeldovich ( 1972 ) .",
    "inverse compton scattering preferentially increases the energy of cmb photons , while conserving photon number , leading to a spectral distortion whose amplitude is proportional to the product of electron temperature and density ( the thermal sz effect ) .",
    "doppler scattering induces an intensity fluctuation with the same spectral shape as the cmb itself ( the kinetic sz effect ) .",
    "the thermal effect is one of the main sources of secondary cmb anisotropies on small angular scales .",
    "the perturbation in the cmb thermodynamic temperature resulting from scattering of nonrelativistic electrons is @xmath22 @xmath23 where @xmath24 ghz is the dimensionless frequency and the second expression is valid in the rayleigh - jeans limit , which we assume henceforth . the quantity @xmath25 is known as the comptonization parameter and is given by @xmath26 where the integral is performed along the photon path .",
    "the kinetic sz effect arises from the motion of ionised gas with respect to the rest frame of the cmb .",
    "the resulting temperature fluctuation is @xmath27 where @xmath28 gives the magnitude of the effect and @xmath29 is the component of the gas peculiar velocity along the line of sight ( positive sign for receding gas , negative for approaching ) to the observer .",
    "the gas which causes  forest absorption has a density near the cosmic mean , with a volume weighted temperature around @xmath30 k at @xmath3 ( e.g , schaye 2000 , mcdonald 2001 ) . at this temperature",
    ", we expect the contribution from the ksz to dominate the @xmath31 temperature fluctuations of the cmb from the  forest . using observed  forest line counts , loeb ( 1996 ) estimated that the @xmath31 temperature fluctuations from the ksz would be @xmath32 for the  forest lying between @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "this is for angular scales of order 1 arcmin , with a @xmath35 decrease on larger scales .",
    "there is much competition from other signals on these small scales ( including low redshift thermal sz from galaxy clusters , the ostriker - vishniac ( 1986 ) effect , patchy reionisation ( see , e.g. mcquinn et al .",
    "2005 ) , and foreground sources ) .",
    "the suggestion to cross - correlate information from sdss  forest spectra and the cmb was also made by loeb ( 1996 ) in order to try to better extract the signal . in this paper",
    ", we measure the ksz effect in simulations , as well as the thermal effect .",
    "the mass weighted temperature of the igm at @xmath18 is expected to be closer to @xmath36 ( e.g. , springel , white and hernquist 2001 ) , and so the thermal effect should be significant .",
    "how much of that hot gas is physically associated with  absorption will affect how well the tsz can be detected by cross - correlation .",
    "we note that both being absorption phenomena , neither the sz signal nor the  forest opacity are directly affected by the inverse square law .",
    "the problem of finding bright qso background sources aside , they therefore both have an advantage in the hunt for baryons at high redshifts . indeed , the value of the sz effect for finding galaxy clusters at the highest redshift has long been recognised ( see e.g. , carlstrom 2002 for a review ) .",
    "we aim to explore its potential for finding diffuse ionised material at @xmath37 .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we give details of the hydrodynamic cosmological simulation and how mock  spectra and cmb temperature sky maps were constructed from the same volume of space . in section 3 , we compute statistical measures of the absorption and examine correlations between the two probes of the intergalactic medium . in section 4 , we compare directly to observational data from the sdss and wmap , and in section 5 we summarise and discuss our results .",
    "we employ a hydrodynamical simulation of the popular @xmath38cdm cosmology to make our prediction of the  and the sz effects . in order to both resolve the  features and the bulk velocities responsible for the ksz effect , we require a large simulation volume with good mass resolution .",
    "the data snapshots we use are from the simulation `` g6 '' , also used by nagamine ( 2005 ) to which we refer the reader for more details , which describes a representative cubic volume of space @xmath39 on a side , in a cosmological constant - dominated cdm universe , consistent with measurements from the wmap satellite ( bennett 2003 , spergel 2003 ) .",
    "the relevant parameters are @xmath40 , @xmath41 @xmath42 , and a hubble constant @xmath43 .",
    "the initial linear power spectrum is cluster - normalised with a linearly extrapolated amplitude of @xmath44 at @xmath45 .",
    "the simulation was performed with the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code gadget-2 ( springel 2001 , springel 2005 ) , which is based on the entropy - conserving approach of springel & hernquist ( 2002 ) , and is an extension of the `` g - series '' runs of springel & hernquist ( 2003b ) .    the baryonic matter is initially represented by @xmath46 sph particles and the collisionless dark matter by @xmath46 n - body particles .",
    "the initial mass per gas particle is therefore @xmath47 and dark matter @xmath48 .",
    "the gravitational softening length is @xmath49 .",
    "the calculation includes gas dynamics , cooling , a multiphase treatment for star formation ( see springel & hernquist 2003a ) , and a uniform background of ionising radiation in the manner of katz et al .",
    "( 1996b ) , renormalising the haardt & madau ( 1996 ) spectrum to reproduce the observed  forest mean optical depth .",
    "a study of the sz effect using this code was carried out by springel , white , & hernquist ( 2002 ) , who noted that the additional physics beyond adiabatic gas dynamics had a relatively small effect ; changing , for example , the mean comptonization by @xmath50 .",
    "we use simulation outputs from redshifts @xmath51 and @xmath52 to make mock  spectra . for each output , this was done in the usual manner , by integrating through the sph kernels of the particles to obtain the neutral hydrogen density field , and then convolving with the line of sight velocity field ( see e.g. , hernquist 1996 ) . at each redshift , we compute @xmath53 lines of sight , equally spaced on a square grid . in order to approximate longer spectra",
    ", we join together spectra after performing a random translation , reflection and choice of axis , as is done for example when making skymaps by ray - tracing through multiple copies of the simulation volume ( e.g. , da silva 2000 ) . as our fiducial spectrum length",
    ", we take the distance between the  and  emission lines . later in the paper , when we cross",
    "- correlate the  forest and cmb at a particular redshift , our analysis will refer to this  to  region , centered on the redshift in question . for reasons of computational simplicity , we choose to ignore evolution over the length of each spectrum , both in clustering and in the mean optical depth .",
    "the  to  regions correspond to comoving spatial distances of @xmath54 and @xmath55 when centered on redshifts @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "we add partial spectra to the full spectra to ensure the correct overall length .    for each spectrum , we compute the mean effective optical depth over its entire length , i.e. , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the mean absorbed flux in the spectrum , @xmath60 . throughout most of this paper , we will use this quantity , @xmath61 , to determine the relative amount of  absorption in each sightline .",
    "another possible measure is to compute the total column density of neutral hydrogen along each sightline from  to  .",
    "being unaffected by saturation , this will tend to reflect the presence of individual high density clouds .",
    "as noted earlier , the simulation was run using the uv ionising background of haardt & madau ( 1996 ) . in our subsequent analysis ,",
    "we rescale the  optical depths by a small amount after computing the spectra by adjusting them slightly so that @xmath59 averaged over all spectra reproduce the observational results of schaye ( 2004 ) , @xmath62 for @xmath56 .      at each redshift , we construct maps of the compton @xmath25 parameter and the doppler @xmath63 parameter by projecting the appropriate sph kernel weighted quantities along one axis . unlike springel ( 2001 )",
    ", for example , we do not project along lines which meet at a single @xmath45 observer , as we will be interested only in the sz signal generated by gas which falls within the same redshift interval as our  forest spectra . in order to compare cmb maps and spectra for the same volume of space , we randomly translate and reflect our sz maps in the same manner so they match up with the spectra from the previous section .",
    "we generate 40 maps , which have an angular size which subtends the whole box at each particular redshift ; i.e. , 94.7 arcmin at redshift @xmath33 , and 77.2 , 68.5 , 63.1 and 59.5 arcmin at @xmath64 and @xmath52 respectively .",
    "we make maps at a resolution corresponding to @xmath65 pixels , but also average the pixels so that we have @xmath53 , the same number as the  spectra .      looking at ksz maps and  spectra generated from the same region of space",
    ", we can see if there are any obvious visual relationships between the cmb temperature in pixels and the appearance of the absorption features .",
    "in figure [ mapspectsz ] , we show the compton @xmath25 parameter , from the thermal sz effect at @xmath33 , and alongside it five spectra which are taken with the sightline along the axis perpendicular to the plane of the map . here , in both maps and spectra , we do not plot the entire  to  region ( we do this later , below ) , but just the material in one single cubic simulation volume .",
    "it is apparent from the map that much of the volume contributes to a very small @xmath25 parameter , and that most of this redshift slice has @xmath66 or below .",
    "there are also a number of obvious galaxy clusters , with @xmath67    of course , a map of the @xmath25 parameter from all material between @xmath45 and the last scattering surface would have quite a different appearance , with the mean @xmath25 parameter being higher , of the order of @xmath68 , and with many of the obvious filaments seen in figure [ mapspectsz ] washed out by projection effects .",
    "figure 2 of white ( 2002 ) demonstrates this , using a similar simulation .",
    "sightlines ( a)-(c ) in figure [ mapspectsz ] were chosen from those among the @xmath69 we made which have large values of @xmath25 .",
    "spectrum ( a ) is visibly taken from near a cluster , seen in the sz map . there , however , does not seem to be much evidence of this in absorption , at least in terms of saturated absorption .",
    "the other two spectra , ( b ) and ( c ) are also fairly similar , even though they are both associated with large @xmath25 values .",
    "because there is not much saturated absorption , we can see that it is unlikely that column density will correlate well with sz decrement .",
    "sightlines ( d ) and",
    "( e ) in figure [ mapspectsz ] have been chosen to have values of @xmath25 near the bottom of the rank - ordered list of all pixels . from the sz plot",
    "it can be seen that the spectra lie on sightlines though obvious voids , and the @xmath25 values are 10000 times smaller than for panels ( a)-(c ) . on examination",
    ", these spectra appear to have very few wide absorption features compared to spectra ( a)-(c ) , and the overall level of  absorption is slightly lower ( particularly ( e ) ) .",
    "turning now to the map of the ksz effect ( figure [ mapspec ] ) , we see that much of this redshift @xmath33 slice has a doppler @xmath70 value of @xmath71 , although there are several clusters and filaments dense enough and moving fast enough to reach @xmath72 .",
    "clusters can be seen moving towards the observer ( blue ) and away ( red ) .",
    "the large coherence length of the velocity field can be seen also , from the size of the red and blue structures . projecting the ksz effect for a larger volume , for example subtending @xmath73 , will lead to more structures but also more cancellation of positive and negative @xmath63 values .",
    "the general level of fluctuations likely agrees at least roughly with the estimate of loeb ( 1996 ) ( @xmath31 @xmath74 ) .",
    "again , the ksz plot can be compared to full lightcone maps ( e.g. figure 2 of springel 2001 ) , which show a similar pattern of approaching and receding material , also with less obvious filamentary structure .",
    "sightlines ( a ) and ( b ) in figure [ mapspec ] were chosen to have large positive doppler @xmath63 values , and ( d ) and ( e ) negative .",
    "it can be seen that their spectra contain fairly substantial amounts of absorption , and one can understand how the mass weighted velocity will give rise to the @xmath63 values seen .",
    "panel ( c ) has a velocity field which cancels in the left and right halves of the spectrum , yielding a @xmath63 parameter much closer to zero ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "the number of sightlines passing close to galaxy groups and clusters in figures [ mapspectsz ] and [ mapspec ] is relatively small , at least in this redshift interval .",
    "this means that any clustering statistic which weights spectra equally will tend to be sensitive to physical conditions in the regions with relatively small overdensity .",
    "looking at a few individual sightlines , it seems likely that there is a connection between  forest absorption and sz - induced temperature fluctuations .",
    "one way to examine this further would be to look at skymaps of both the  forest and cmb .",
    "of course , with real observations it unlikely that we would have a dense enough grid of background quasars to make a true  map , but with the simulations , we can use such a technique to examine the spatial pattern of absorption . in figure",
    "[ maps ] , we show examples of such maps , plotting the thermal and kinetic sz effects alongside angular maps of the  optical depth and column density . it should be noted that we plot the absolute value of the temperature change produced by the kinetic effect . unlike the previous two figures ,",
    "here we show a projection through the volume of space corresponding to an entire  to  region ( not just one simulation box ) .",
    "the results are centered on redshift @xmath33 , and the angular size of the maps is 95 arcmins . because we have a grid of @xmath69  spectra , we have rebinned the cmb maps so that they have the same resolution ( 1.5 arcmin pixels ) .",
    "the grayscales of the sz maps are the same , and so we can see from the left two panels of figure [ maps ] that the thermal and kinetic effects trace similar features , with the thermal effect being more prominent at this redshift . because of the differing frequency dependence of the two sz effects , cross - correlation of the two maps may eventually be possible using observational data , as suggested for example by da silva ( 2000 ) . in the present context , we are interested in the potential cross - correlation of the  forest spectra and the sz effects . in the third panel of figure [ maps ] , we show the mean effective optical depth , given by equation ( [ taueq ] ) for spectra through the center of each pixel .",
    "it can clearly be seen that the patches of absorption largely follow the sz temperature well , although there are several regions with large differences .",
    "the  fluctuations have a somewhat lower contrast , varying by about a factor of two across the map .",
    "the obvious groups and clusters in the sz maps do not show up as prominently in the  map .",
    "this is likely to at least partly owe to the fact that regions with large amounts of  absorption are saturated .",
    "this is not the whole story , however , as we can see by looking at the rightmost panel of figure [ maps ] . here",
    ", we show the hi column density in each spectrum integrated from  to  .",
    "there is much smaller scale structure present , as the dense knots of neutral hydrogen are picked out .",
    "the range of column densities varies from @xmath76 @xmath77 to @xmath78 @xmath77 .",
    "the structures in @xmath79 do not correlate well with the cmb maps .",
    "the smooth , large - scale structures in the sz effect maps ( and  ) are not readily seen .",
    "this observation will guide our use of  as the main  statistic to be used .    in figure [ tvstau ]",
    ", we show a scatter plot of the  against the thermal sz temperature decrement , at redshifts @xmath80 and @xmath81 , again from maps with @xmath69 pixels ( 1.5 , 1.2 and 1.1 arcmin size for @xmath82=2,3,4 ) .",
    "the correlation between the two quantities is apparent , and in particular at each redshift there are few lines of sight with very low values of  but substantial sz decrements .",
    "there is a large amount of scatter , however , indicating that even if foreground / background noise is not an issue , it will be necessary to average over many sightlines to obtain statistically significant results .",
    "in this section , we use the set of skymaps and spectra generated from our simulation to examine statistically the cmb fluctuations caused by  forest gas .      in figure [ rmsksz ]",
    ", we show the @xmath31 temperature fluctuations averaged in top - hat circles on the plane of the sky , calculated from maps such as those shown in the left two panels of figure [ maps ] .",
    "we show results centered on integer redshifts between @xmath33 and @xmath83 , in each case , calculating only the cmb fluctuations caused by gas within the  to  region of the spectrum .",
    "the thermal and kinetic sz effects are shown separately , and it can be seen that at @xmath33 , @xmath84 is approximately three times larger for the tsz effect , as we expect from figure [ maps ] . at @xmath85 arcmin ,",
    "the @xmath31 @xmath86 fluctuations are @xmath87k for the tsz at this redshift .",
    "the curves for all redshifts have an angular dependence given by @xmath88 . at @xmath3 ,",
    "the two sz effects are comparable , and beyond that the ksz effect stays approximately constant out to @xmath34 .",
    "the @xmath31 peculiar velocity of the gas increases slightly with decreasing redshift , as detailed in table [ tabz ] .",
    "this is balanced by the decrease in angular size for a given comoving length which shifts the curves to the left .",
    "the main change in the ksz at @xmath83 is caused by the switching on of the uv ionising background in our model , and so the ionised fraction is small then .",
    "the temperature of the gas influences the fluctuations owing to the thermal effect directly , and this has a much more rapid dependence on redshift . in table [ tabz ] , we can see that at @xmath83 , the electron - weighted mean temperature is @xmath89 , as the free electrons are concentrated in the few collisionally ionised structures present at that redshift . by @xmath34",
    "when most of the igm is photoionised , the electron - weighted temperature is @xmath90 k , and as gravitational evolution continues , shock heating increases the temperature by another factor of 20 by @xmath33 .",
    "the rise in @xmath84 owes mostly to this , with a small part coming from the factor 2.3 increase in linear density fluctuations themselves between the two redshifts .",
    "we note that although the thermal sz effect is dominant at redshifts @xmath91 , the signal that is actually generated in gas that directly produces the  forest is a small fraction of the total thermal sz signal at that redshift .",
    "this is because the temperature of  forest - producing gas at the mean density at @xmath3 is @xmath92k , low enough that the thermal sz effect should be extremely small ( e.g. , loeb 1996 ) .",
    "the thermal sz signal we are instead seeing is largely generated in the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim , e.g. dav 2001 ) at these redshifts which is collisionally ionised , and is responsible for the higher mass - weighted temperature seen in table 1 . as we discuss below , the thermal sz signal at this redshift is strongly correlated with the  absorption signal , indicating that the whim signatures are physically associated with the same large - scale structures as the  forest , tracing their higher density regions .",
    ".the mass density and electron number weighted gas temperature and velocity dispersion in the simulation at different redshifts . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tabz ]      we have seen that igm gas at redshifts @xmath33 to @xmath34 yields rms cmb temperature fluctuations on the order of a few @xmath93k .",
    "one could calculate the angular power spectrum , the @xmath94s , and then see whether it could be separated from other small angle fluctuations",
    ". owing to the multitude of other possible signals , however , it is likely to be more useful to cross - correlate with material at a known redshift , and use this to extract information .",
    "as the  forest contains most of the baryons at these redshifts , and the mean effective  optical depth appears to correlate visually with cmb temperature in figure [ maps ] , we use this quantity in our cross - correlation .",
    "we compute the cross - correlation separately for the tsz and ksz effects .",
    "for the ksz , because the magnitude of the effect can be positive of negative , we work with @xmath95 .",
    "although this is not easily done with observational data , in the current section we are interested in making a relative comparison between the magnitude of the tsz and ksz effects , where this is a useful approach . in order to do the cross - correlation , for each  spectrum",
    "we first calculate @xmath96 , where @xmath97 and we use the average mean transmitted flux for all spectra .",
    "the cross - correlation we compute is @xmath98 , which has units of @xmath93k . for the ksz we use @xmath99 and for the tsz , @xmath100 .",
    "the results for redshifts @xmath101 are shown in figure [ corr ] .",
    "we have not rebinned the cmb temperatures to the angular resolution of the spectrum grid , so that we are able to show results down to angular scales below 1 arcmin .    unlike the case for the @xmath31 @xmath86 fluctuations",
    ", one can see that the cross - correlation statistic for the ksz effect depends on redshift , driven by evolution in the  forest . on first inspection , this is somewhat puzzling , as  fluctuations should be increasing towards high redshift , as the mean optical depth increases , but instead they are smaller .",
    "this is because we have divided out @xmath102 , and so the fractional fluctuations are indeed smaller .",
    "measurements based on the flux @xmath103 , instead divide out @xmath59 which is smaller at high redshift ( see e.g. , croft 1998 ) .    this statistic and its spatial dependence could in principle",
    "be measured observationally for the thermal sz effect .",
    "we will return to this point in section 5 .",
    "we have seen from figure [ tvstau ] that there is a dependence of sz decrement and the  for spectra in the same pixel .",
    "we will average this relationship over many pixels and bin as a function of  , in order to visualise the mean trend of t vs .",
    "this simple statistic is one which we will concentrate on in this subsection , and use in section 4 below to compare to observational data .",
    "the mean trend of t vs  does depend on the resolution of the cmb map , and we present results for the same resolution as the spectrum grid ( @xmath53 pixels , each of width 1.2 arcmin at z=3 ) as well as smoothing with a gaussian filter with fwhm 13 arcmin ( the wmap w - band resolution , see bennett 2003 ) .",
    "we will also plot the @xmath31 temperature fluctuations in pixels caused by the kinetic sz effect .",
    "figure [ tauvsrms ] shows our results for three different redshifts , with the top panels being the tsz decrement .",
    "we can see that the overall level of the temperature decrement is strongest for @xmath33 and weakest for @xmath104 , as expected . at @xmath33 ,",
    "pixels with  = 0.07 have tsz temperature decrements of @xmath105k , and the pixels with  = 0.2 have decrements @xmath106k . between these two extremes ,",
    "the trend of t with  is close to linear .",
    "the spectra with the very highest levels of absorption , @xmath107 , exhibit a weakening of the decrement , likely owing to radiative cooling of the gas in these high density regions producing relatively more neutral hydrogen .",
    "the signal smoothed at the wmap resolution is somewhat weaker , but still easily measurable from the simulations .    in the middle panels of figure [ tauvsrms ]",
    ", we show the ksz induced @xmath31 temperature fluctuations .",
    "they exhibit a rise with increasing  , in accord with the rise in density probed by the sightlines , again with a turndown for the spectra with the very highest absorption levels . as with the @xmath31 in circles plotted in figure [ rmsksz ] ,",
    "the level of fluctuations changes little with redshift . smoothing the map to the wmap resolution",
    "does affect the level strongly , however , reducing the magnitude of the signal by roughly a factor of ten . as",
    "@xmath31 fluctuations are already more difficult to measure in the presence of noise than the mean level , this means that it is likely that the thermal rather the kinetic sz effect will be easiest to target when considering the analysis of observational data",
    ".    one can ask whether the signal from the tsz and ksz effects arises in low or high density gas , and whether we are really sampling the low density igm probed by the  forest . because our measure of the  - t correlation is angular pixel weighted ( we are using a histogram of pixel values ) , the fact that most of the sightlines we use will contain relatively little gas comes into play . for example",
    ", only a few of the pixels in figure [ maps ] pass close to clusters and groups , and most of the spectra with the lowest 90 percent of  values are likely to pass through only void - like regions in the  to  interval .",
    "this means that while the thermal sz does directly probe the mass weighted ( or rather electron number - weighted ) igm temperature , and so is dominated by virialised objects , by breaking up the signal as a function of  we introduce sensitivity to what is occurring in low density regions .    in figure",
    "[ maps ] , we saw that there appeared to be a much better correspondence between cmb temperature and  than hi column density .",
    "nevertheless , from looking at the maps it was not immediately obvious that the very highest density objects are in fact associated with large amounts of hi and have a significant sz signal . in figure [ nh1vsrms ]",
    "we plot cmb t vs @xmath79 , and see that there is a slight increase in the sz signal for sightlines with @xmath108 @xmath77 , for all redshifts .",
    "the curves , however , are relatively flat at higher column densities .",
    "it appears that information from saturated regions will not be helpful in carrying out  forest cmb correlations , and so there is little need for high resolution spectra . in order to shed further light on this , in figure [ nh1vsf ]",
    "we have plotted values of @xmath79 vs  for individual sightlines , as a scatter plot ( as always , we average over the  to  region in each spectrum ) .",
    "we expect there to be an envelope , a minimum @xmath79 for sightlines with a given  .",
    "this minimum level would correspond to a uniform distribution of absorbing material ( see e.g. , weinberg 1997 ) .",
    "we can see such an envelope , but also a large scatter towards higher values of @xmath79 .",
    "the fractional scatter in @xmath79 increases for larger  , so it is not surprising that for high there is little evidence of a trend in figure [ nh1vsrms ] .",
    "the microkelvin fluctuations produced by the  forest gas are likely too small to be detected directly in current data ( e.g. , bennett 2003 , kuo 2004 ) .",
    "however , it is possible that by comparing observational statistics with simulation results we can come up with interesting limits on the population of ionised baryons , as well as estimating the properties of the observations necessary to make a direct detection .",
    "based on our investigations in the previous sections , a good strategy will be to measure  for the forest as well as the cmb temperature in pixels where there are spectra .",
    "for the present limited observational study , we choose to investigate the one - dimensional distributions of these statistics , as in section [ oned ] .",
    "we do this for reasons of simplicity , and because breaking up the signal into sightlines with high and low absorption levels will enable us to look for an obvious distinct signature ( unlike a full spatial cross - correlation analysis which would have more discriminating power , but be more difficult to interpret ) .    in our analysis",
    ", we calculate the mean and rms cmb temperature for pixels binned using the  of the spectra that pass through them .",
    "we use a jackknife estimator ( e.g. , bradley 1982 ) to compute the error bars , breaking up the data into 50 subsamples .",
    "we have also computed error bars by randomly rotating the cmb data with respect to the  forest data and find them to be broadly consistent .",
    "we use the  forest of quasar spectra taken from data release 3 of the sloan digital sky survey ( abazajian 2005 ) .",
    "our data sample consists of 3488 quasar spectra with quasar redshifts greater than @xmath109 , pruned to remove broad absorption line quasars .",
    "the particular dataset was compiled from the publically available data by scott burles and kindly made available to us ( burles , private communication ) .",
    "owing to the relatively high low - redshift limit for the quasars , the spectra consist of the full  to  region of the forest , lying above the atmospheric cutoff at @xmath110   .",
    "this will be useful in order to be consistent with what was done in the simulations .",
    "the one - dimensional distribution of  requires that the data be divided into broad bins ( we will use five bins ) . in order to calculate  for each spectrum",
    ", we need to fit the continuum over the full  to  region .",
    "historically , the averaged value of the mean transmitted flux from many spectra has been used to calculate a global value of  ( e.g. , kirkman 2005 ) .",
    "fluctuations in  for entire spectra have not been estimated , however , presumably owing to problems with calculating a mean value on large scales where continuum fluctuations are seen to be comparable to fluctuations in the absorption ( see for example the power spectrum of the raw spectrum in hui or mcdonald ) .",
    "the largest scale on which fluctuations intrinsic to the  forest have been measured is 153 mpc at redshift @xmath111 by tytler ( 2004 ) , who find that lyman limit systems and metal lines make large contributions to fluctuations in the mean flux at this relatively low redshift . in our case",
    ", we will be working at @xmath3 , where these effects should be less important .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that there will be a large contribution to the variation in  from sightline to sightline owing to continuum estimate errors as well as noise in the spectra and non-  absorption .",
    "we leave the question of how best to fit the continuum on the largest scales to other work ( e.g. , suzuki 2005 ) , and in the meantime , we will add a gaussian distribution of errors to our simulation measurement to account for these effects when comparing our simulations with observations . the relatively large bin size should serve to mitigate effects of errors in this first illustrative comparison .",
    "we fit the continuum using the often employed polynomial fitting method ( e.g. , croft 1998 ) .",
    "a low order polynomial ( 3rd order in our case ) is fit to the  forest region .",
    "we avoid the  and  emission lines by restricting our fit to the rest wavelength range 1030 - 1190 .",
    "we then remove all points more than 2 @xmath112 below the continuum and refit , iterating this procedure until convergence is achieved .",
    "averaging over all  pixels in our dataset , we find a mean redshift @xmath113 . at this stage",
    "we divide out the continuum and compute a value of @xmath103 . for all spectra",
    ", we find @xmath114 . measurements of the mean flux and global value of from higher resolution datasets better suited to this measurement find a lower value of @xmath103 ( e.g. , schaye 2004 , kirkman 2005 ) .",
    "our measurement of @xmath103 is on average biased high because we miss absorption in flatter low density regions around the continuum owing to our low resolution .",
    "we correct for this bias in a crude way by multiplying the value of the fit continuum in each case by @xmath115 .",
    "this simple correction is adequate for our current purposes , having been set so that we reproduce the global value of schaye ( 2004 ) at @xmath3 .",
    "we make the assumption that any random variations in this bias from spectrum to spectrum will simply act as an additional source of noise which we can model in our simulation data .    in the bottom panel of figure [ wmap ] we have plotted a histogram of the  values derived from the sdss spectra .",
    "the mode of the distribution is  = 0.35 , the same as the simulation results at @xmath3 plotted in figure [ tauvsrms ] . in the observational data ,",
    "there is a tail extending down to @xmath116 and up to @xmath117 which owes to noise and the continuum fitting uncertainties described above .",
    "we make use of the wmap first year data ( bennett 2003 ) in our analysis .",
    "for the illustrative application of  -cmb cross - correlation in this paper , we employ the foreground cleaned version of the data presented by tegmark ( 2004 ) .",
    "the cmb temperature is given in healpix format ( @xmath118 ) pixels , at the resolution of the wmap w - band data ( 13 arcsec fwhm ) .",
    "the tegmark map is chosen by us because it combines the 5 wmap channels into a map with the highest angular resolution possible .",
    "however , because it is derived from channels with different frequencies and the thermal sz effect has a weak frequency dependence , the map will have a scaled value of the sz effect present , dependent on the weights used to combine the channels . in order to understand what impact this will have",
    ", we can use equation 3 to examine the thermal sz temperature fluctuations in the different bands .",
    "equation 3 can be written in the form @xmath119 , and at the lowest frequencies , @xmath120 .",
    "the five wmap channels are centered at frequencies of 23 , 33 , 41 , 61 and 94 ghz .",
    "the values of @xmath121 for the channels are then @xmath122 and @xmath123 , respectively .",
    "the weights for the tegmark map vary spatially and are not publically available , but one can see the maximum difference of the effect compared to our rayleigh jeans approximation ( @xmath124 ) by considering the 94 ghz w - band map on its own , which gives approximately a @xmath125 reduction in the predicted tsz signal .",
    "if we instead assume that the weights will have a similar effect to those used by the wmap team itself for their linearly combined map , we find by summing over the 5 bands that @xmath126 , or a @xmath127 reduction , the effect of frequency dependence is therefore small enough and uncertain enough that we neglect it in our illustrative application to observational data . in the future , however , as we have mentioned before , the frequency dependence can be used to better extract the signal .",
    "we will return to this point .    for each pixel centered on one of the sdss quasar spectra",
    ", we extract the corresponding cmb temperature of that pixel . in order to crudely mitigate the effects of primary cmb anisotropies , which act as noise for our signal ,",
    "we subtract a local background consisting of the cmb temperature averaged over all pixels in an annulus of inner radius 15 arcmin and outer radius 25 arcmin , centered on the pixel in question .",
    "our motivation for this background subtraction is the fact that the sz signals fall off rapidly on large scales ( e.g. see figure [ corr ] ) , unlike the cmb primary signal . because we will only be computing an upper limit to the sz signal , this subtraction is a conservative assumption .",
    "the presence of cmb primordial anisotropies will produce fluctuations on large scales .",
    "for example , there will be coherent fluctuations on the 100 arcmin scales which our simulated sky maps cover .",
    "the annulus subtraction technique represents a crude way to deal with this .",
    "as we shall see below , the noise level on the pixel scale is sufficiently large with the wmap data that we are not limited by the primary fluctuations in our analysis .",
    "however , in the future , with better data it will become imperative to model and remove the effect of the primordial anisotropies .",
    "this could be done with matched filtering ( e.g. , schaefer 2004 ) , and the technique tested with simulations of the cmb sky which include large - scale anisotropy , foregrounds , noise and an instrumental beam response .",
    "we leave this for future work , and in section [ disc ] we will discuss other more sophisticated ways to deal with the cmb data .",
    "we find the @xmath31 temperature fluctuations in all 3488 pixels containing spectra to be @xmath128k . in the middle panel of figure [ wmap ]",
    "we show the @xmath31 temperature in each of 5 bins .",
    "the error bars range from 1.3 to @xmath129 k. this is close to the poisson error estimate in each case , which is not surprising because the pixels are sampled quite sparsely from the data .",
    "given that we expect @xmath130k @xmath31 fluctuations at most from the kinetic sz effect , it is clear that this particular dataset will fall short of giving us any meaningful constraint from the ksz . because the ksz signal will add in quadrature to the @xmath31 from the noise and cmb primary signal , the highest  bin might have a total @xmath31 of @xmath131k and the lowest @xmath132k , a difference of 0.02 @xmath93k .",
    "in practice , because the cmb data is smoothed , we expect at least a factor of 10 less signal ( see the middle panel figure [ tauvsrms ] ) .",
    "the ksz signal is therefore at least 500 times too small to be detectable in this way with these data .",
    "if instead we turn to the thermal sz signal , the situation is much more promising . as a mean temperature rather than a variance , it is easier to constrain this signal from noisy data . in the top panel of figure [ wmap ]",
    "we show the mean temperature in pixels for the 5 bins of  . owing to the background subtraction ,",
    "the mean value of the pixels is zero .",
    "when comparing to the simulation data , we will renormalise so that the same is true .",
    "the observational error bars vary from 1.3 to 8.0 @xmath93k per bin .    from figure [ tauvsrms ] , we expect the mean temperature decrement from the thermal sz effect at redshift @xmath3 to exhibit a total variation of @xmath133k amongst the pixels with highest and lowest  forest  .",
    "this is for cmb maps at the wmap resolution , but unfortunately not including noise in the  estimates .",
    "as detailed in section 4.2 above , we model the effects of noise in the spectra and continuum fitting uncertainties by adding a gaussian - distributed error to the  from simulations .",
    "we add a  value randomly drawn from a normal distribution with standard deviation @xmath134 .",
    "doing this to the simulated values of  enables us to reproduce the width of the histogram of observed  values . in the top panel of figure [ wmap ]",
    "we plot the curve of simulation cmb temperature @xmath135 vs. simulated  after this noise has been added .",
    "the line which lies closest to the @xmath136 axis is this prediction .",
    "as we can see , the predicted variation of @xmath135 with  is barely noticeable on this scale , indicating that tight constraints lie only in the future with larger observational datasets .",
    "nevertheless , the comparison is interesting because it constitutes an attempt to detect the ionised baryons at @xmath3 , and the sensitivity increase required for success if our current cosmological models are correct is only about one order of magnitude . in order to place an upper limit on the temperature and density of ionised baryons using existing data , one would ideally use a grid of simulations with different values of the baryon density , with the amplitude of matter fluctuations normalised so that their clustering and other properties are consistent with observations ( e.g. spergel 2003 , tegmark 2004 ) . in this manner , both the clustering of baryons and the variation of mean igm temperature with @xmath8 could be marginalised over to yield a constraint on @xmath8 from ionised baryons , @xmath137 .",
    "the effects of varying @xmath8 on structure at high redshift were explored with a suite of simulations by gardner ( 2003 ) .",
    "these authors found for example that forest absorption is virtually unaffected by changing @xmath8 ( by a factor @xmath138 ) , as long as the ionising background intensity is adjusted to reproduce the same value of  .    in the present case , because of the large error bars , the value of @xmath137 consistent with observations is likely to be so high that a simpler and more crude approach than a full simulation grid is all that is warranted . in order to model the effect of increasing @xmath8 we simply multiply the simulation value of sz @xmath135 by a constant factor , assumed to be equivalent to multiplying @xmath8 by the same factor .",
    "we do not adjust the  observables , imagining that any increase in baryon density can be cancelled out by the presence of a uv background radiation field higher in intensity by the same factor .",
    "moreover , we assume that increasing @xmath8 does not affect the amplitude of matter fluctuations and that the temperature of the igm stays the same as in the @xmath139 simulation .",
    "a model with a very large value of @xmath8 is likely to have many other differences related to gas physics and cooling , such as the number of collapsed baryonic objects . additionally , of course , it will be incompatible with big bang nucleosynthesis constraints ( e.g. , burles and tytler 1998 ) , and measurements of @xmath8 from the cmb acoustic peaks ( spergel 2003 ) .",
    "none of these problems concern us here , as our comparison to simulations is essentially illustrative .    under these assumptions , a @xmath140 fit of the simulation data to the wmap / sdss data ,",
    "both binned in the same manner , yields @xmath141 at @xmath142 confidence and @xmath143 at @xmath6 confidence .",
    "the limits on the fraction of the critical density in ionised baryons at @xmath3 are therefore very weak .",
    "this is as one would expect from looking at figure [ wmap ] where we show the simulation curves for various values of @xmath137 .",
    "it is possible to conclude that the universe is not closed by ionised baryons , but not much else .",
    "this situation is likely to be much improved with future observational data , as we will discuss below .",
    "much of the statistical power in the measurement comes from the bin with the lowest value of  .",
    "most of the pixels have moderate values of  but these pixels in the lowest bin also have low sz decrement amplitudes . in this manner",
    ", the cmb-  forest cross - correlation can be said to be probing the low density igm .",
    "using a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation we have investigated the cmb temperature fluctuations caused by the diffuse igm at redshifts @xmath144 , also responsible for the  forest .",
    "our main findings can be summarised as follows : +   + ( 1 ) at redshift @xmath33 , the kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich effect from gas within the  to  region of the forest is predicted to cause cmb fluctuations of amplitude 0.8 @xmath93k rms averaged in a top - hat filter of angular radius 1 arcmin .",
    "this remains roughly constant for higher redshifts .",
    "+   + ( 2 ) the thermal sz at redshift @xmath33 yields an rms t of 2.4 @xmath93k . at",
    "higher redshift , the relative fluctuation owing to the thermal sz compared to kinetic sz declines as expected because of the decreasing mean temperature .",
    "however , there is still a substantial @xmath145 at higher redshift , 0.4 @xmath93k at @xmath104 .",
    "+   + ( 3 ) there is a correlation between  forest properties of quasar spectra with cmb temperature fluctuations caused by both the kinetic and thermal sz effects . in particular , there is a strong relation between the mean effective optical depth  averaged over the entire  forest region and the cmb temperature .",
    "pixels ( of size @xmath146 1 arcmin ) in the top 10 percentile of  are predicted to have a mean cmb temperature 1.5 @xmath93k lower than the bottom 10 percentile at @xmath33 , owing to the thermal sz effect .",
    "the quantity  is relatively sensitive to density fluctuations in the diffuse igm . +   + ( 4 ) there is , however , little correlation between the total hi column density in spectra and the cmb temperature , with no relation at all seen for column densities @xmath147 .",
    "this statistic is most sensitive to the neutral hydrogen density in saturated regions , indicating that sz effects correlate best with relatively diffuse unsaturated gas .",
    "+   + ( 5 ) we have compared the correlation of  with cmb t seen in simulations of the @xmath38cdm cosmology with observational data from the sloan digital sky survey and wmap . because the kinetic sz signal and pixel noise add in quadrature , no constraints are possible on the igm velocity field with the present data . however , the sensitivity is within an order of magnitude of that necessary to detect the predicted thermal sz effect from the forest .",
    "we are able to place a weak limit on the density in ionised baryons at @xmath3 of @xmath148 at @xmath149 confidence .",
    "below we outline future developments which would make a direct detection possible .      in the present paper",
    ", we have examined the relationship between forest absorption and the sz effect in general , without the expectation that a detection of a correlation can be made from current data . in the future ,",
    "the quality and size of datasets will increase , and it will become worthwhile to plan a strategy for the cross - correlation that makes the best use of the data .",
    "two obvious improvements could be made in the future . in our illustrative comparison of wmap and sdss data",
    "we did not use the full angular or frequency information , both of which would help with the sensitivity of the test .    as we have seen",
    "that the thermal sz effect offers the best hope for detection of the ionised baryons , making use of the spectral difference between the sz decrement and the primary cmb signal will enable easier detection of the effect .",
    "one could imagine fitting the  -t correlation in different cmb frequency bands to do this .",
    "for example , in the work of huffenberger ( 2004 ) , a method was derived for combining the wmap channels in an optimal manner to remove the primary anisotropy , effects of noise and contaminating point sources , enabling the thermal sz signature to be constrained directly . in this paper",
    "we have concerned ourselves with predictions for the rayleigh jeans part of the spectrum , which is reasonable given the large observational uncertainties in present data .",
    "we note that at higher frequencies the thermal sz signal becomes positive ( for example at 330 ghz the magnitude is the same as the rayleigh jeans signal but with the opposite sign ) .",
    "bolometers tend to be more sensitive than radiometers at present , and they operate at frequencies @xmath150 ghz . these differences could be used profitably to increase the signal to noise of any detection . also , with the wmap data",
    ", we have limited our analysis to single pixels .",
    "making use of the full spatial cross - correlation in our detection of the signal will be useful when cmb datasets with higher angular resolution become available .",
    "another possibility could be to use wavelets to isolate the relevant physical scales in a future analysis ( see e.g. , vielva 2005 ) .",
    "one can ask whether emission from the qsos themselves might create a signal , as the sed of qsos in the microwave band is not well constrained ( perna & di matteo 2000 , white & majumdar 2004 ) . apart from the possible intrinsic microwave emission of qsos , there will also be an intrinsic thermal sz effect from galaxy clusters which host qsos . neither of these will necessarily bias any measurement of the  -cmb correlation unless qsos with more  absorption in their spectra have more intrinsic microwave emission .",
    "this seems unlikely in the former case , although in the case of an sz signal associated with clusters in which the qsos lie one could argue that this is part of the signal that we are trying to measure .",
    "otherwise , it could be removed if we so desire by not using the part of the spectrum closest to the qso .",
    "the method we have outlined in this paper is one way to potentially detect ionised baryons in the igm at high redshift . in general",
    ", one would like to know if there are any other methods that can be used . at lower redshifts , for example ( @xmath151 ) , the ionised baryons are mainly collisionally ionised , with such a low neutral fraction that they can not be seen in the  forest . their higher temperature ,",
    "however , means that this warm hot intergalactic medium ( whim , see e.g. , cen 1995 , 1999 , dav et al 2001 ) can potentially be detected by looking for x - ray absorption ( e.g. , fang 2002 ) or emission ( yoshikawa 2004 , fang 2005 ) or perhaps in  emission ( e.g. furlanetto et al .",
    "2003 , 2005 ) .",
    "the thermal sz signal at low redshifts is also one way to detect the whim . at higher redshifts and lower igm temperatures considered in this paper however , the x - ray signal ( see e.g. , croft 2001 ) is not likely to be observable .",
    "the overall @xmath25-distortion in the cmb spectrum from the hot igm should eventually be detectable .",
    "limits from the cobe firas instrument ( e.g. , mather 1990 ) are @xmath152 at @xmath149 confidence , more than an order of magnitude above the mean @xmath25 caused by the high-@xmath82 igm . however , separating out the contribution from the high @xmath82 igm will be difficult without a spatial correlation of the type we have proposed here .",
    "one could also use other tracers of the high @xmath82 density field for a cross - correlation , such as lyman - break galaxies , or qsos themselves , although their connection to the igm would be less easy to interpret .",
    "another interesting question to ask is how likely it is that we will be able to constrain the high @xmath82 igm velocity field , given that the kinetic sz signal from the photoionised igm is expected to be relatively important ( loeb 1996 ) . because of the possible + ve or -ve nature of the effect ,",
    "depending on the velocity , we can not use a mean signal , unlike the thermal sz . by using an @xmath31 fluctuation as our statistic",
    ", we therefore need a noise level which is extremely low .",
    "since the spectrum of the ksz is the same as the cmb , the primary fluctuations become even more important sources of noise than with the thermal effect .",
    "given that the rms fluctuations on scales of 1 arcmin from the ksz are predicted to be @xmath153k at @xmath33 , one would need the `` noise '' from primary anisotropies and other sources to be less than this in order to detect a signal .",
    "the thermal sz is more promising .",
    "future experiments which will be useful for improving constraints on @xmath154 include the planck satellite mission , the sunyaev zeldovich array ( sza ) , the atacama cosmology telescope ( act , see kosowsky 2003 ) , and the south pole telescope ( spt ) .",
    "given the expected noise characteristics and angular resolution / sky coverage of these instruments , we expect substantial improvements over the constraints derived using wmap in this paper .",
    "we have seen in the wmap case ( section [ wmaps ] ) that we are limited both by the noise level ( @xmath155k rms ) and the resolution of the data . as an example",
    ", the act angular resolution is projected to be @xmath156 arcmin with an @xmath31 detector noise level of @xmath87k per pixel in the 145 ghz band . even without allowing for the higher resolution or using the full angular cross - correlation information",
    ", one would therefore expect to extract the same level  forest thermal sz signal using @xmath157 fewer spectra ( assuming the primary anisotropy can be filtered out in frequency space )",
    ". the act signal will be lower by about @xmath158 at 145 ghz than the rayleigh jeans prediction , but the other frequency bands can be used to increase the significance of the detection . in order to yield a 2-@xmath112 detection of @xmath8 , using pixel - pdf statistics , as in this paper , we estimate that @xmath146 300 quasar  forest spectra would be needed in the act survey area , assuming the bbn value of @xmath159 ( 0.019 ; burles & tytler 1998 ) using angular cross - correlation information would increase the significance of the detection . the lack of overlap between the act fields and the sdss would necessitate a southern quasar survey , although it should be borne in mind that only extremely low resolution spectra are needed .",
    "we note that in our analysis we have assumed that the ratio of neutral to ionised hydrogen is that expected if the ionising background radiation field does not vary spatially in intensity .",
    "if there are coherent spatial fluctuations in the photoionisation rate ( @xmath11 in equation 1 ) then the correlation between  optical depth and cmb temperature decrement will be affected by an additional source of scatter .",
    "this is likely to be small , however with the spatial cross - correlation reduced by @xmath160 or less ( see e.g. , croft 2004 ) and could in principle be calibrated out using theoretical modelling in the manner of mcdonald 2005 .    finally , one can ask why it is important to try to detect the ionised component of the baryons at high redshift when the neutral hydrogen tracer has already been well measured ( e.g. , rauch 1997 ) .",
    "one reason is that a detection would act as a consistency check and enable us to verify directly the baryon inventory at these redshifts . also , at the moment , the best constraints on the baryon density in observed structures ( if we set aside for the moment relatively indirect cmb and big bang nucleosynthesis , bbn measurements e.g. , spergel 2003 , walker 1991 ) comes from looking at the mean absorption level in the  forest ( e.g. , rauch 1997 , weinberg 1997 , hui 2002 , tytler 2004 ) .",
    "however , these measurements are degenerate with constraints on the ionising background radiation intensity @xmath161 .",
    "often , @xmath8 from bbn or cmb is assumed and then the  forest measurement is used to constrain the ionising radiation intensity ( e.g. , kirkman 2005 ) .",
    "if we use actual measurements of @xmath161 ( from e.g. , the proximity effect e.g. , scott 2000 ) then constraints on @xmath8 directly seen in the forest become weaker ( @xmath161 is only known to within roughly a factor of two ) .",
    "measurements of the ionised baryon fraction such as those we propose may therefore become competitive .",

    "<S> the intergalactic neutral hydrogen which is responsible for the forest of quasar absorption lines is a tracer of much larger amounts of ionised hydrogen . </S>",
    "<S> the ionised component has yet to be detected directly , but is expected to scatter cmb photons via the sunyaev - zeldovich effect . </S>",
    "<S> we use hydrodynamic simulations of a lambdacdm universe to create mock quasar spectra and cmb sky maps from the same volume of space . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the high redshift  forest gas causes temperature fluctuations of the order of 1 @xmath0k rms in the cmb on arcmin scales . </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic and thermal sunyaev - zeldovich effects have a similar magnitude at redshift three , with the thermal effect becoming relatively weaker as expected at higher redshift . the cmb signal associated with lines of sight having hi column densities </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 is only marginally stronger than that for lower column density sightlines . </S>",
    "<S> there is a much more significant dependence of rms temperature fluctuation on mean absorbed flux , however , suggesting that the cmb signal effectively arises in lower density material . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the extent to which it is possible to cross - correlate information from the  forest and the microwave background to detect the sunyaev - zeldovich effect at redshifts @xmath2 . in so doing , we are enable to set direct limits on the density of diffuse ionised intergalactic baryons . </S>",
    "<S> we carry out a preliminary comparison at a mean redshift @xmath3 of 3488 quasar spectra from sdss data release 3 and the wmap first year data . assuming that the baryons are clustered as in a lambdacdm cosmology , and have the same mean temperature , the cross - correlation yields a weak limit on the cosmic density of ionised baryons @xmath4 . as a fraction of the critical density </S>",
    "<S> , we find @xmath5 at @xmath6 confidence . with data from upcoming cmb telescopes , we anticipate that a direct detection of the high redshift ionised igm will soon be possible , providing an important consistency check on cosmological models .    </S>",
