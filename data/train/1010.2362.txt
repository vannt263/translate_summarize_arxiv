    "2008 and references therein ) .",
    "de has been conventionally characterized by eos parameter mentioned above which is not necessarily constant .",
    "recently , the parameter @xmath6 is calculated with some reasoning which reduced to some simple parametrization of the dependences by some authors ( huterer and turner 2001 ; weller and albrecht 2002 ; chevallier and polarski 2001 ; krauss et al .",

    "the simplest de candidate is the vacuum energy ( @xmath7 ) , which is mathematically equivalent to the cosmological constant @xmath8 ( allen et al .",
    "2004 ; sahni and starobinsky 2000 ; sola and stefancic 2005 ; shapiro and sola 2009 ) . the other conventional alternatives , which can be described by minimally coupled scalar fields , are quintessence ( @xmath9 ) ( ratra and peebles 1988 ; wetterich 1988 ; liddle and scherrer 1999 ) , phantom energy @xmath10 ) ( caldwell 2002 ; caldwell et al .",

    "<S> a new dark energy model in anisotropic bianchi type - iii space - time with variable equation of state ( eos ) parameter has been investigated in the present paper . to get the deterministic model , we consider that the expansion @xmath0 in the model is proportional to the eigen value @xmath1 of the shear tensor @xmath2 . the eos parameter @xmath3 is found to be time dependent and its existing range for this model is in good agreement with the recent observations of sne ia data ( knop et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2003 ) and sne ia data with cmbr anisotropy and galaxy clustering statistics ( tegmark et al . 2004 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it has been suggested that the dark energy that explains the observed accelerating expansion of the universe may arise due to the contribution to the vacuum energy of the eos in a time dependent background . </S>",
    "<S> some physical aspects of dark energy model are also discussed .     </S>",
