    "one of the most popular methods to address the low - temperature physics of systems exhibiting collective magnetic behavior is spin - wave theory .",
    "ferromagnets and antiferromagnets have been analyzed extensively within this framework over the years , both in three and in two spatial dimensions .",
    "in particular , to cope with systems defined in two spatial dimensions , modified spin - wave theory @xcite and spin - wave theory at constant order parameter @xcite have been invented .    while spin - wave theory worked well for the heisenberg model , it was rather unclear whether this method is also readily applicable to the quantum xy model .",
    "it was then shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that this is indeed the case .",
    "subsequent investigations based on spin - wave theory which address the quantum xy model in two spatial dimensions at zero temperature , can be found in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we are interested in the low - temperature regime of the d=2 + 1 quantum xy model , where the spin waves are the relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "our approach , however , is based on an entirely different method  the method of effective lagrangians which universally applies to any system whose low - energy properties are dominated by goldstone bosons . indeed ,",
    "at zero temperature , the spin waves represent the goldstone bosons which result from the spontaneously broken internal spin rotation symmetry of the heisenberg [ o(3 ) @xmath0 o(2 ) ] and the xy model [ o(2 ) @xmath0 1 ] , respectively .",
    "it is important to note that , at finite temperature , spontaneous symmetry breaking in two ( or less ) spatial dimensions can not occur due to the mermin - wagner theorem @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , the spin waves still dominate the physics of the system at low temperatures .",
    "many articles have addressed the behavior of the quantum xy model in two spatial dimensions near or at the kosterlitz - thouless phase transition , which takes place around @xmath3 for the square lattice @xcite , @xmath4 being the exchange coupling . on the other hand , the thermodynamic properties in the regime @xmath5 , where the spin - waves are the relevant excitations , have only been explored scarcely @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the effect of the spin - wave interaction on the low - temperature properties of the quantum xy model in two spatial dimensions has not been considered so far , to the best of our knowledge .    in refs .",

    "in the present study we go one step farther in the low - temperature expansion by including three - loop effects .",
    "the calculation for the general case o(@xmath6 ) @xmath0 o(@xmath6 - 1 ) , and for two spatial dimensions , has been presented in ref .",
    "that article , however , focused on the special case @xmath6=3 , i.e. , on the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model and did not discuss the physics of the quantum xy model which is the main topic of the present work .",
    "we emphasize that the results for the quantum xy model presented below do not just correspond to adapting the formulas derived earlier for general @xmath6 in ref .",
    "@xcite to the case @xmath6=2 .",
    "rather , we have to renormalize and numerically evaluate a particular contribution in a three - loop graph which was not relevant for the d=2 + 1 antiferromagnet . in the d=2 + 1 quantum xy model",
    "this term in fact represents one of the essential contributions coming from the spin - wave interaction .",
    "the main goal of our systematic three - loop calculation is to answer the question of how the spin - wave interaction manifests itself in various thermodynamic quantities at low temperatures , and how these results are influenced by an external magnetic or staggered field . as it turns out , the spin - wave interaction is repulsive at low temperatures , its magnitude depending on the strength of the external field .",
    "it will be very instructive to compare these findings with those referring to the d=2 + 1 heisenberg antiferromagnet .",
    "we emphasize that our systematic three - loop calculation appears to be beyond the reach of conventional methods such as spin - wave theory  or would require such an immense effort that it would not be worthwhile trying to solve the problem with microscopic methods .",
    "we then discuss in which parameter regime the series derived in this work are valid . on the one hand ,",
    "our effective results are restricted to temperatures low compared to the underlying microscopic scale , given by the exchange integral @xmath4 . in the case of the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model",
    "the domain of validity is also restricted due to the nonperturbatively generated mass gap .",
    "recently , both the quantum xy model and the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model in two spatial dimensions have been analyzed numerically in refs .",
    "@xcite , where high - precision measurements using the very effective loop - cluster algorithm were presented . comparing these numerical results with analytic two - loop calculations obtained within effective field theory , permitted to extract some combinations of low - energy constants at the permille level  above all , it demonstrated the correctness of the effective field theory approach for these systems whose low - energy physics is dominated by spin waves . in order to promote the effective lagrangian method",
    ", we would like to provide the interested reader with a series of articles where this method has been used to address condensed matter problems .",

    "[ summary ] , and some technical details regarding the effective description of heisenberg and xy magnets , as well as the renormalization and numerical evaluation of a particular three - loop graph are discussed in appendices [ appendixa ] and [ appendixb ] .",
    "on the microscopic level , the quantum xy model in two spatial dimensions is described by the hamiltonian @xmath7 we assume that the lattice is bipartite , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent nearest - neighbor lattice sites with spacing @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath4 is the ferromagnetic exchange coupling constant .",

    "the quantity @xmath15 represents a weak external magnetic field which is restricted to the xy - plane and couples to the magnetization order parameter @xmath16 , @xmath17 at infinite volume and zero temperature , the vacuum expectation value of its second component is different from zero , @xmath18 indicating that the @xmath19 spin symmetry is spontaneously broken .    on a bipartite lattice , and in the absence of an external field , the antiferromagnetic quantum xy model is related to the ferromagnetic one by a unitary transformation .",
    "in fact , the mapping also holds if we allow for external fields , as we show now . applying the similarity transformation @xcite @xmath20 on every site @xmath8 of the odd sublattice",
    ", the ferromagnetic xy hamiltonian turns into @xmath21 this hamiltonian describes the antiferromagnetic xy model in the presence of the field @xmath22 , which we now interpret as staggered field @xmath23 in the xy - plane , as it couples to the staggered magnetization order parameter @xmath24 .",
    "there is thus a one - to - one correspondence between the xy ferromagnet in a magnetic field and the xy antiferromagnet in a staggered field on a bipartite lattice . from now on , in order to compare our results with the heisenberg antiferromagnet , we stick to `` antiferromagnetic xy language '' .",
    "the systematic effective lagrangian method is designed for systems which display a spontaneously broken global symmetry . in the case of the quantum xy model , the continuous spin symmetry o(2 ) is spontaneously broken by the ground state to 1 at @xmath2 .",
    "the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model , on the other hand , follows the pattern o(3 ) @xmath0 o(2 ) . as a consequence of goldstone s theorem ,",
    "the low - energy dynamics of both systems is governed by the spin - waves or magnons , which are characterized by a linear , i.e. , relativistic dispersion relation .",
    "essential aspects of the effective lagrangian technique and the perturbative evaluation of the partition function have been outlined on various occasions , such that here we only provide a minimum of information needed to understand the present calculation .",
    "more details can be found in section 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite and in appendix a of ref .",
    "furthermore , pedagogic introductions to the effective field theory are provided in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the quantum xy model ,",
    "the relevant excitation at low energies is the magnon .",
    "it is convenient to define a unit vector field @xmath25 , @xmath26 which contains the goldstone boson field in its first component @xmath27",
    ". remember that we have chosen the weak external field to point along the 2-direction , @xmath28 . accordingly",
    "the spin waves represent fluctuations orthogonal to this direction .",
    "the organization of the effective lagrangian is based on the number of time and space derivatives the various terms display .",
    "terms with few derivatives dominate the low - energy physics of the system , while terms containing more derivatives are less important .",
    "we are thus dealing with a systematic expansion in powers of energy and momenta .",
    "the leading - order effective lagrangian of the quantum xy model contains terms with two time ( @xmath29 ) and two space ( @xmath30 ) derivatives , @xmath31 as well as a term containing the external staggered field @xmath32 and the constant @xmath33 which is the staggered magnetization at zero temperature and infinite volume .",
    "all these contributions are of momentum order @xmath34 and lead to a relativistic dispersion relation , @xmath35 where the quantity @xmath36 is the spin - wave velocity .",
    "if one identifies the spin - wave velocity with the velocity of light , the leading - order effective lagrangian becomes ( pseudo- ) lorentz invariant .",
    "setting @xmath37 , we may use relativistic notation , @xmath38 the quantity @xmath39 in the dispersion relation is then interpreted as the `` mass '' of the magnon , i.e. , the energy gap in the spectrum , which is related to the external field by @xmath40 note that ( pseudo-)lorentz invariance is an accidental symmetry of @xmath41 , which is not shared by the microscopic xy model",
    ". moreover , the symmetry only emerges at leading order in the derivative expansion ",
    "higher - order contributions in the effective lagrangian explicitly break ( pseudo-)lorentz invariance .",
    "in fact , they also break o(2 ) space rotation symmetry due to the anisotropies of the underlying lattice which start manifesting themselves at order @xmath42 . in the present paper , however , we assume ( pseudo-)lorentz invariance also at next - to - leading order @xmath43 , and thus obtain @xcite : @xmath44 it is important to point out that the conclusions of the present paper are not affected by this idealization , as we explore in the following sections .    at",
    "leading order ( @xmath34 ) we have two coupling constants , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , while at next - to - leading order ( @xmath42 ) five constants , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , are required to describe the ( anti)ferromagnetic quantum xy model within effective field theory .",
    "in contrast to the derivative structure of the terms in the effective lagrangian , symmetry does not fix these coupling constants which parametrize the physics of the underlying microscopic quantum xy model .",
    "rather , they have to be determined experimentally or in a numerical simulation . using magnetic terminology ,",
    "the square of the effective coupling constant @xmath45 is the spin stiffness or helicity modulus .",
    "while the quantities @xmath49 and @xmath50 represent the staggered magnetization and the staggered external field in the case of the antiferromagnetic xy model , we may also interpret them as magnetization and external magnetic field of the ferromagnetic xy model , provided that the underlying microscopic lattice is bipartite .    in appendix [ appendixa ]",
    "we show that on the effective level as well , there is a one - to - one mapping between the ferromagnetic quantum xy model in a magnetic field and the antiferromagnetic quantum xy model in a staggered field for bipartite lattices .",
    "note that there is no such mapping between the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic heisenberg model .",
    "indeed , as is well - known , the heisenberg ferromagnet is different , the magnons displaying a quadratic dispersion relation .",
    "this essential difference between the quantum xy and the heisenberg model , as outlined in appendix [ appendixa ] , can be traced back to the nature of the spontaneously broken symmetry : while the group o(2 ) is abelian , the group o(3 ) is non - abelian .",
    "the partition function for ( 2 + 1)-dimensional ( pseudo-)lorentz - invariant systems with a spontaneously broken global symmetry o(@xmath6 ) @xmath0 o(@xmath6 - 1 ) [ at @xmath2 ] has been evaluated within the effective lagrangian framework up to three - loop order in ref .",
    "@xcite . for the heisenberg antiferromagnet ( @xmath6=3 ) ,",
    "the rather nontrivial part performed in that reference was the renormalization and numerical evaluation of a specific three - loop graph . in the present case of the quantum xy model ( @xmath6=2 ) a different three - loop contribution , as will become clear below , emerges which needs to be renormalized and evaluated numerically .",
    "this quite elaborate calculation , not needed for the antiferromagnet , is presented in detail in appendix [ appendixb ] , as it is rather technical .",
    "we briefly review the essential results derived in ref .",

    "but there is an important difference in the low - temperature dynamics of the quantum xy and the af heisenberg model in two spatial dimensions , we want to point out . unlike the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional quantum xy model",

    "@xcite , this subtle effect also implies that the external field @xmath61 can not be switched off completely in our effective low - temperature expansions .",
    "yet another difference between the two models is the following .",
    "although neither one of them exhibits spontaneously broken order at finite temperature and zero external field , the d=2 + 1 quantum xy model nonetheless has a finite transition temperature , while the d=2 + 1 antiferromagnetic heisenberg model does not .",
    "one thus may raise the question whether this difference can be seen in the perturbative effective lagrangian approach .",
    "the answer is negative , since the physics near the finite kosterlitz - thouless transition temperature of the d=2 + 1 quantum xy model occurring at @xmath3 ( square lattice ) , is beyond the reach of the effective lagrangian method .",
    "the effective approach is only valid in the regime where the spin waves are the relevant degrees of freedom : low temperature and weak external field .",
    "the effective series are on safe grounds up to maybe one third of the topological transition temperature @xmath105 , but they definitely break down as one approaches @xmath105 from below .",
    "hence the effective method can not see this difference between the xy model and the antiferromagnet in two spatial dimensions .",
    "below the kosterlitz - thouless phase transition , which takes place at @xmath3 for the square lattice , the physics of the d=2 + 1 quantum xy model is dominated by the spin waves . within the effective lagrangian perspective",
    ", we have analyzed the partition function up to three loop - order and have derived the low - temperature series for various thermodynamic quantities , including the order parameter .",
    "although the low - temperature regime of the d=2 + 1 quantum xy model has been explored before , here , for the first time , to the best of our knowledge , we have performed a fully systematic study by using effective field theory .",
    "in particular , we have discussed how the spin - wave interaction manifests itself at low temperatures .    in the pressure",
    ", the interaction shows up at next - to - leading order through a term proportional to four powers of the temperature , related to a two - loop graph .",
    "subsequent contributions originate from three - loop graphs and are of order @xmath90 .",
    "we also pointed out that , in the case of the d=2 + 1 heisenberg antiferromagnet , the two - loop contribution is zero : the spin - wave interaction only sets in at order @xmath90 .",
    "still , as we have explained , the strength of the interaction is larger in the heisenberg antiferromagnet than in the quantum xy model . in both cases ,",
    "the interaction is repulsive .",
    "while the spin - wave interaction in the d=2 + 1 quantum xy model tends to zero for very weak staggered field , in the d=2 + 1 heisenberg antiferromagnet , on the other hand , the spin - wave interaction gets stronger .",
    "it is essential that the external staggered field @xmath61 in our effective analysis is kept finite .",
    "switching it off completely , our effective series become meaningless , because the `` critical '' temperature @xmath138 , below which the spin - wave picture is valid , tends to zero .",
    "this is how the mermin - wagner theorem raises its head in our effective calculation .",
    "as we have argued , lattice anisotropies only become relevant in the subleading lagrangian @xmath43 , giving rise to a next - to - next - to - leading order effect in the partition function , which does not affect our conclusions .",
    "still , the lattice geometry does affect our results in a trivial way , because the low - energy constants @xmath33 ( staggered magnetization at zero temperature and zero external field ) , @xmath36 ( spin - wave velocity ) and @xmath104 ( spin stiffness or helicity modulus ) take different values on e.g. the square and the honeycomb lattice .",
    "we find it quite remarkable that all these results follow from symmetry considerations only .",
    "in particular , the fact that the spin - wave interaction in the pressure is repulsive , is an immediate consequence of the spontaneously broken symmetry o(2 ) ( @xmath2 ) of the d=2 + 1 quantum xy model .",
