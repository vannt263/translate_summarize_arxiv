    "although perturbative aspects of electro - weak interaction are well described by the standard model , its non - perturbative phenomenon such as baryon number asymmetry have to be investigated beyond the perturbation theory . at present ,",
    "the most powerful non - perturbative technique is the lattice field theory .",
    "however it is non - trivial to define the standard model on a lattice since it is a type of chiral gauge theories , construction of which is one of the long - standing problem of lattice field theory : because of the fermion doubling problems , a naively @xmath3-dimensional discretized lattice fermion field yields @xmath4 fermion particles , half of one chirality and half of the other , so that the theory becomes non - chiral@xcite .",
    "several lattice approaches have been proposed , but so far none of them have been proven to work successfully@xcite .",
    "d. kaplan has proposed a new construction of lattice chiral gauge theories via domain - wall models@xcite .",
    "starting from a vector - like gauge theory in @xmath5 dimensions with a fermion mass term being a shape of a domain - wall in the ( extra ) @xmath6th dimension , he showed in the weak gauge coupling limit that a massless chiral state arises as a zero mode bound to the @xmath7-dimensional domain - wall while all the doublers have large masses of the lattice cut - off scale .",
    "it has been also shown that the model works well for smooth background gauge fields@xcite .",
    "two simplified variants of the original kaplan s domain - wall model have been proposed : an `` overlap formula''@xcite and a `` waveguide model''@xcite .",
    "gauge fields appeared in these variants are @xmath7-dimensional and are independent of the extra @xmath6th coordinate , while those in the original model are @xmath6-dimensional and depend on the extra @xmath6th coordinate .",
    "these variants work successfully for smooth background gauge fields @xcite , as the original one does .",
    "non - perturbative investigations for these variants seems easier than that for the original model due to the simpler structure of gauge fields .",
    "however it has been reported@xcite that the waveguide model in the weak gauge coupling limit can not produce chiral zero modes needed to construct chiral gauge theories . in this limit , if gauge invariance were maintained , pure gauge field configurations equivalent to the unity by gauge transformation would dominate and gauge fields would become smooth . in the set - up of the waveguide model ,",
    "however , @xmath7-dimensional gauge fields are non - zero only in the layers near domain wall ( waveguide ) , so that the gauge invariance is broken in the edge of the waveguide .",
    "therefore , even in the weak gauge coupling limit , gauge fields are no more smooth and become very `` rough '' , due to the gauge degrees of freedom appeared to be dynamical in this edge . as a result of the rough gauge dynamics , a new chiral zero mode with the opposite chirality to the original zero mode on the domain wall appears in the edge , so that the fermionic spectrum inside the waveguide becomes vector - like .",
    "it has been claimed@xcite that this `` rough gauge problem '' also exists in the overlap formula since the gauge invariance is broken by the boundary condition at the infinity of the extra dimension@xcite .",
    "furthermore an equivalence between the waveguide model and the overlap formula has been pointed out for the special case@xcite .",
    "although the claimed equivalence has been challenged in refs.@xcite , it is still crucial for the success of the overlap formula to solve the `` rough gauge problem '' and to show the existence of a chiral zero mode in the weak gauge coupling limit .    in the original model",
    "there are two inverse gauge couplings @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the coupling constant in ( physical ) @xmath7 dimensions and @xmath1 is the one in the ( extra ) @xmath6th dimension .",
    "very little are known about this model except @xmath11 case@xcite where the spectrum seems vector - like and the case of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional u(1 ) model@xcite . since perturbation theory for the physical gauge coupling @xmath10",
    "is expected to hold , the fermion spectrum of the model can be determined in the limit that @xmath12 . in this weak coupling limit",
    ", all gauge fields in the physical dimensions can be gauged away , while the gauge field in the extra dimension is still dynamical and its dynamics is controlled by @xmath13 . instead of the gauge degrees of freedom in the edge of the waveguide , @xmath6th component of gauge fields represent roughness of @xmath7-dimensional gauge fields .",
    "an important question is whether the chiral zero mode on the domain wall survives in the presence of this rough dynamics .",
    "the dynamics of the gauge field in this limit is equivalent to @xmath7-dimensional scalar model with @xmath14 independent copies where @xmath14 is the number of sites in the extra dimension . in general at large @xmath13",
    "such a system is in a `` broken '' phase where some global symmetry is spontaneously broken , while at small @xmath13 the system is in a `` symmetric '' phase .",
    "therefore there exists a critical point @xmath15 , and it is likely that the phase transition at @xmath16 is continuous ( second or higher order ) .",
    "the `` gauge field '' becomes rougher and rougher at smaller @xmath13 .",
    "indeed we know that the zero mode disappears at @xmath11@xcite , while the zero mode exists at @xmath17 ( free case ) .",
    "so far we do not know the fate of the chiral zero mode in the intermediate range of the coupling @xmath13 .",
    "there are the following three possibilities : ( a ) the chiral zero mode always exists except @xmath11 . in this case",
    "we may likely construct a lattice chiral gauge theory in both broken ( @xmath18 ) and symmetric ( @xmath19 ) , and the continuum limits may be taken at @xmath20 .",
    "this is the best case for the domain - wall model .",
    "( b ) the chiral zero mode exists only in the broken phase ( @xmath18 ) . in this case",
    "the domain - wall method can describe a lattice chiral gauge theory in the broken phase at finite cut - off .",
    "however it is likely that the continuum limit taken at @xmath20 from above leads to a vector gauge theory .",
    "( c ) no chiral zero mode survives except @xmath17 .",
    "the original model can not describe lattice chiral gauge theories at all .",
    "it is very important to determine which possibility is indeed realized in the domain - wall model .    instead of ( 4 + 1)-dimensional models ,",
    "we have recently investigated a ( 2 + 1)-dimensional u(1 ) model@xcite . using a quenched approximation",
    "we have carried out a numerical simulation to see whether chiral zero modes exist or not in this model . in the weak coupling limit of the physical gauge coupling the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional u(1 ) gauge system is reduced to the 2-dimensional u(1 ) spin system .",
    "strictly speaking , there is no order parameter in the 2-dimensional u(1 ) spin system . on a large but finite lattice ,",
    "however , the behavior of the model is similar to the one of a 4-dimensional scalar model : on a finite lattice we regard the kosterlitz - thouless phase as the  symmetric  phase and the spin - wave phase as the  broken  phase . in the  broken  phase we have numerically found that there exists a critical value of a domain - wall mass @xmath21 which separates a region with a fermionic zero mode on the domain wall from one without it . in the  symmetric  phase the critical values of the domain wall mass seems to also exist but is very close to its upper bound @xmath22 , so that the region with a fermionic zero mode is very narrow . because of the difficulty observed in the numerical simulation near @xmath22 we can not exclude a possibility that the existence of the zero mode is an artifact of finite lattice size effects .",
    "further simulation we have made on larger lattice sizes can not give a definite conclusion .",
    "since , as mentioned before , the phases of the model in the infinite volume limit is different from the ones of the 4-dimensional model , we did not attempt to increase lattice sizes further , for example @xmath23 , to see the fate of zero mode in the symmetric phase .",
    "instead we have decided to investigate the ( 4 + 1)-dimensional u(1 ) model directly , to obtain the definite conclusion on the existence of zero modes in the symmetric phase .    in this paper , in order to know the fate of the chiral zero mode , we have carried out a numerical simulation of a domain - wall model in 4 + 1 dimensions with a quenched u(1 ) gauge field in the @xmath24 limit . in sec.2 , we have defined our domain - wall model with dynamical gauge fields .",
    "we have calculated a fermion propagator by using a kind of mean - field approximation , to show that there is a critical value of the domain - wall mass parameter above which the zero mode exist .",
    "the value of the critical mass may depend on @xmath13 , which controls the dynamics of the gauge field .",
    "in sec.3 , we have calculated the fermion spectrum numerically using quenched approximation at @xmath25 and at various values of domain - wall masses .",
    "we have found that in the broken phase ( @xmath26 ) there exists the range of a domain - wall mass parameter in which the chiral zero mode survives on the domain - wall . in the symmetric phase ( @xmath27 ) , however , from data on several lattice sizes we have found an numerical evidence that the chiral zero mode disappears in the infinite volume limit of 4-dimensional euclidean space - time .",

    "[ volumedep ] ( a ) and ( b ) , where @xmath130 s take 4 , 6 , 8 on the @xmath163 lattices . the values of @xmath71 s are almost independent of @xmath142 at the each @xmath162 except the right - handed modes at @xmath164 .",
    "the solid circles represent the order parameter @xmath107 defined in eq.([eqn : order ] ) .",
    "the behaviors of @xmath71 s at different @xmath142 are almost identical each other and are very similar to that of @xmath107 except the right - handed ones at @xmath164 .",
    "we think that the observed deviation of @xmath71(right - handed ) at @xmath164 from those at other @xmath142 s is not a real effect but a statistical fluctuation , since the @xmath161 for the fit at @xmath164 is almost flat in the region between @xmath103 and @xmath165 . ignoring this data at @xmath164",
    "we see that @xmath71 can be identified with @xmath107 , and therefore @xmath71 becomes zero as the lattice size goes to infinity since the order parameter @xmath107 defined in eq.([eqn : order ] ) becomes zero in the infinite volume limit .",
    "this analysis leads us to a conclusion that the fermion spectrum in the symmetric phase is _ vector - like_.    fig .",
    "[ symmfs0 ] also shows that the fermion masses tend to approach the line @xmath166 , which is the value of the mass for free wilson fermion at a positive @xmath37-layer , as the lattice volume increases .",
    "furthermore in fig .",
    "[ symmfsm1 ] as a function of @xmath142 , we have also plotted @xmath150 at @xmath167 ( a negative @xmath37-layer ) .",
    "as the volume increases the mass difference between right - handed and left - handed fermions becomes smaller and both masses seem to approach to the line @xmath168 , the value of the mass for free wilson fermion at a negative @xmath37-layer .",
    "this data also supports our conclusion on the absence of chiral zero modes in the symmetric phase .",
    "in summary our results of @xmath150 at both positive @xmath37- and negative @xmath37-layer suggest that chiral zero modes in the symmetric phase disappear in the infinite volume limit .",
    "this concludes that the original kaplan s model fails to describe lattice chiral gauge theories in the symmetric phase .",
    "using the quenched approximation , we have performed the numerical study of the domain - wall model in 4 + 1 dimensions with the u(1 ) dynamical gauge field on the extra dimension . from this study",
    "we obtain the following results . in the broken phase of the gauge field",
    ", there exists the critical value of the domain - wall mass separating the region with a chiral zero mode and the region without it in the same case of ( 2 + 1)-dimensional model . at the domain - wall mass larger than its critical value , a zero mode with one",
    "chirality exists on the domain wall . in the symmetric phase ,",
    "on the other hand , our data on @xmath163 with @xmath1694 , 6 , 8 lattices suggest the absence of chiral zero modes in the infinite volume limit , though the chiral zero mode seems to exist on finite lattices .",
    "we also found that fermion propagators obtained through numerical simulations on finite lattices are well described by the mean - field propagator with @xmath170 . since the existence of chiral zero modes in the symmetric phase is essential for the success of the original domain - wall model ,",
    "our results for the ( 4 + 1)-dimensional model indicate that the original domain - wall model can not work as lattice chiral gauge theories .    in 2 + 1 dimensions we could not conclude whether the fermionic zero mode exists or not because of the difficulty for the simulation near @xmath171 and the absence of the order parameter in the infinite volume limit for the 2-dimensional u(1 ) model .",
    "we try here to extract the parameter @xmath71 of the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional model , by the method used for the ( 4 + 1)-dimensional model . in figs .",
    "[ z2d ] ( a ) and ( b ) , the parameter @xmath71 is plotted as a function of @xmath162 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath71 is almost identical to that of order parameter @xmath107 in eq.([eqn : order ] ) but not to the square root of plaquette in eq.([energy ] ) .",
    "this new analysis shows that zero modes are absent in the symmetric phase in the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional u(1 ) model as well as the ( 4 + 1)-dimensional model .",
    "therefore we conclude that u(1 ) chiral gauge theories can not be constructed via an original domain - wall model , regardless of its dimensionality .",
    "one of the remaining question is whether the above negative conclusion also holds for other gauge groups such as su(2 ) .",
    "the answer is not so straightforward : for example , the 2-dimensional su(2 ) spin model has a symmetric phase only .",
    "we wonder whether chiral zero modes are absent in the symmetric phase even if the gauge field of the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional domain - wall model becomes `` smooth '' for large but finite @xmath13 . to answer this question we are currently investigating the ( 2 + 1)-dimensional su(2 ) domain - wall model .",
