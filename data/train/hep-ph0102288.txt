    "such functional form , together with the chosen electron energy window , affects instead the `` width at half maximum '' of the response function . in sk , the normalized cross sections as a function of the electron energy , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , are both very similar for any fixed neutrino energy @xmath17 @xcite .",

    "in fact , the shape of the normalized cc cross section in sno is very different from the es case , being peaked at a total electron energy only slight smaller ( by @xmath65 mev ) than the @xmath6 energy , with a long tail at low @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "therefore , if _ identical _ electron energy ranges were taken for sk and sno , @xmath20=[\\tilde{e}_e^{\\min},\\,\\tilde{e}_e^{\\max}]$ ] , the sno response function would be much narrower ( and peaked to slightly higher neutrino energies ) than the sk response function ( e.g. , compare figs .  2 and 7 in @xcite ) .",
    "the functional difference in the cross sections and in their @xmath67-values ( and also , to same extent , the difference in the detectors resolution , @xmath68 ) , render the sno response functions _ tipically different _ from those of sk . in order to achieve an _ approximate equalization _ , as the one shown in fig .  2",

    "it also explicitly incorporates possible deviations from the standard @xmath0b flux through the factor @xmath82 .",
    "the physical content of such result can be expressed as follows : for any @xmath55-th sk bin above 8 mev , it turns out that there is a sno energy interval where the average suppression ( @xmath103 ) of the @xmath8 flux due to oscillations is the same in the two experiments . then , modulo factors as @xmath82 and @xmath102 , one can get also the average suppression of the @xmath9 flux in sk ( @xmath85 ) , and thus a link between the sk and sno rates which is independent of the specific probability function @xmath104 .",
    "we discuss now some possible applications of eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) .    when official cc spectrum data ( and thus the @xmath105 s ) will be released by sno , eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) will provide a determination of @xmath82 , namely , of the absolute @xmath0b flux at the sun ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "this fact was derived in @xcite by using _",
    "total _ sk and sno rates with appropriate thresholds ; our table  ii generalizes such result to several energy spectrum ranges @xmath100 , so that the value of @xmath82 will be _ overconstrained_. notice that such constraints on @xmath82 will _ precede _ the independent determination of @xmath82 through the neutral current ( nc ) measurement planned in the near future in sno @xcite .",
    "table  ii can also be used to cross - check possible spectral deviations ( or their absence ) in sk and sno . if there is ( not ) a specific spectral distortion pattern @xmath107 in the sk spectrum above 8 mev ,",
    "a similar pattern must show up , independently of @xmath93 , in the sequence @xmath108 above 5.1 mev in sno ( within uncertainties ) , according to table  ii .",
    "although it is intuitively clear that , if sk finds hints of spectral deviations , they should also be found by sno @xcite , table  ii provides a quantitative and well - defined way to make such cross - check , with the great advantage that no prior assumption is needed about the ( unknown and unobservable ) function @xmath104 .",
    "pending official and definite cc spectrum data from sno , we use table  ii to make a sort of `` prediction '' for the sno spectrum , based on the measured sk spectrum @xcite . figure  3 shows , in the upper panel , the normalized sk spectrum @xmath109 @xcite above 8 mev . in each of the thirteen bins @xmath110_i$ ] ,",
    "the height of the grey box is equal to the @xmath111 statistical error @xmath112 .",

    "the results are shown in the lower panel of fig .  3 , where the grey boxes have now a width determined by @xmath116_i$ ] , and are thus partially overlapping .",
    "the meaning of such exercise is the following : in the presence of generic active @xmath6 oscillations , and for @xmath113 , the measured sno spectrum has to be consistent with the lower panel of fig .  3 , in order to be compatible with the present sk data and their @xmath111  ( stat . ) errors .",
    "the exercise in fig .",
    "3 can be repeated for @xmath117 ( not shown ) .",
    "a final remark is in order , concerning the uncertainties affecting eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) . besides the experimental uncertainties in the sk and sno rates ,",
    "the main theoretical uncertainty is related to the _ absolute _ normalization of the @xmath14 cross section for cc interactions in sno , which enters in the calculation of @xmath118 [ eq .",
    "( [ r0_sno ] ) ] and thus propagates to the normalized rate @xmath105 [ eq .  ( [ r_sno ] ) ] .",
    "such error is estimated in @xcite to be @xmath119 at @xmath120 , by comparing different calculations ; a more definite evaluation ( and possibly a reduction ) would be highly desirable .",
    "compared with such uncertainty , the error induced by the approximate sk - sno equalization [ eq .",
    "( [ error ] ) ] is typically less relevant , except perhaps in the worst case ( @xmath47 energy range ) .",
    "finally , notice that table  ii involves thirteen couples of quantities , which have correlated errors . besides the obvious bin - by - bin correlation of detector systematics in sk ( and , independently , in sno ) , the @xmath0b spectrum shape uncertainty @xcite represents a systematic error in _ common _ to sk and sno .",
    "moreover , since the energy ranges @xmath116_i$ ] partially overlap in sno ( fig .  1 )",
    ", the corresponding sno rates @xmath105 are also statistically correlated .",
    "all such `` complications '' of a joint sk - sno analysis can actually be handled by standard statistical techniques ( e.g. , covariance matrices ) ; however , pending detailed data and official evaluations of uncertainties in sno , we do not furtherly explore this matter at present .",
    "in this section we show that our main result [ eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) ] is basically preserved in the presence of a nonnegligible _ hep _ neutrino contribution to the sk and sno event rates , modulo a redefinition of the factor @xmath82 .    the latest evaluation ( bp 2000 ) of the standard _ hep _ flux is @xmath121 @xmath77  s@xmath78 @xcite , with large ( unquoted ) uncertainties .",
    "we parametrize such uncertainty by introducing ( analogously to @xmath82 ) a free parameter @xmath122 multiplying @xmath123 .",
    "the neutrino energy spectrum at the sun ( as far as sk and sno are concerned ) becomes then : @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the _ hep _ neutrino energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "we recall that the slight `` excess '' of events in the high - energy tail of the sk normalized spectrum @xcite is roughly consistent with the standard contribution @xmath126 from _ hep _ neutrinos @xcite , and provides a 90% c.l .",
    "upper bound to such contribution , @xmath127as derived in @xcite through an analysis with unconstrained @xmath82 .",
    "as an example of relatively `` large '' _ hep _ flux we consider then the reference case @xmath128 .    as for @xmath0b neutrinos [ eqs .",
    "( [ rhobe])([rhobc ] ) ] , one can introduce for _ hep _ neutrinos three new response functions , @xmath129 which are defined analogously to eqs .",
    "( [ rhoe])([rhoc ] ) , modulo the replacement of @xmath25 with @xmath125 .",
    "correspondingly , one can define three new averaged probabilities , @xmath130 figure  4 shows the sk response functions @xmath131 and @xmath132 ( graphically coincident with the solid curve ) in three representative high - energy bins , together with the sno response function @xmath133 ( dotted curve ) in the corresponding energy ranges given in table  i. the response functions are somewhat different from each other , the difference becoming rapidly larger in lower energy intervals ( not shown ) .",
    "therefore , we can not derive a reasonably approximate equality of the kind @xmath134 [ as it was instead the case for @xmath0b neutrinos , eq.([pequal ] ) ] however , this potential problem practically disappears in the combination with @xmath0b neutrinos .",
    "in fact , let us consider the combined b+_hep _ response functions @xmath135 for a source flux as in eq .",

    "in the same table , we also report the ratios between the standard contributions of _ hep _ neutrinos ( @xmath140 ) to @xmath0b neutrinos ( @xmath141 ) in each @xmath55-th energy range .",

    "therefore , we expect that , although the sk and sno response functions to _ hep _ neutrinos can be noticeably different ( see fig .",

    "in addition , suppose that both the @xmath109 s and the @xmath105 s are measured with high precision , and that @xmath82 is also precisely determined from the nc measurement in sno @xcite : then the only unknown would be @xmath122 , which could be hopefully determined by applying eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) to the highest energy ranges ( say , @xmath163 , and possibly @xmath164 ) where @xmath162 is largest .",
    "of course , at the level of accuracy required to determine the absolute _ hep _ neutrino flux @xmath165 from the sk and sno data , one needs a very careful estimate of all the uncertainties involved , including the intrinsic approximations of our approach .",
    "in this section we briefly discuss some limitations or modifications of our results , which can arise when neutrino oscillations are affected by earth matter effects @xcite , or by transitions to a sterile state @xmath166 .",
    "so far , we have implicitly assumed one and the same probability function @xmath104 for both sk and sno . this assumption is no longer valid in the presence of sizable earth matter effects ( during nighttime ) , since the different sk and sno latitudes imply different nadir angle ( @xmath167 ) exposures for the two experiments @xcite .",
    "although the sk data have already excluded a significant fraction of the parameter space where earth matter effects are large @xcite , one can not exclude that more precise sk ( and sno ) data may still reveal some distortion in the nadir distribution ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . in such case , the probability function @xmath93 could be significantly different in sk and sno , especially along the inner trajectories traversing the earth core , where mantle+core interference effects can occur @xcite , and where the exposure functions in sk and sno are significantly different .",
    "it follows that , if sizable earth matter effects would emerge in sk or sno nighttime data , our approach could be strictly applied only to daytime events .",
    "notice , however , that the sk and sno exposure functions , although different in principle , turn out to be approximately similar in the nadir angle range @xmath168 ( see fig .  3 in @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , modulo such approximation , one could still assume one and the same function @xmath104 in sk and sno ( and thus apply our results ) for the fraction of nighttime data with @xmath169 $ ] .",
    "recent global fits to solar neutrino data , including the latest sk results @xcite , tend to disfavor pure @xmath170 oscillations @xcite as compared to @xmath171 , although it is perhaps too early to claim rejection of the @xmath166 scenario @xcite . in any case , mixed ( active+sterile ) solar neutrino oscillations are certainly still allowed @xcite , and can also be made consistent with the atmospheric neutrino oscillation evidence @xcite . in the general case of active+sterile oscillations ,",

    "unfortunately , one can not eliminate both @xmath159 and @xmath175 from the above equations , so as to derive a model - independent relation between the sk and sno rates analogous to eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) .",
    "however , one can eliminate at least @xmath176 to get the relation @xmath177 which might still provide a useful test of @xmath170 transitions .",
    "in fact , the quantity @xmath178 is independent of energy range index @xmath55 only if @xmath179 .",
    "therefore , variations of the left - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ rela ] ) in different energy ranges would provide a signature of @xmath170 transitions with energy - dependent probability .",
    "further links between @xmath109 and @xmath105 can only be obtained by making some assumptions about @xmath174 .",
    "for instance , by assuming pure sterile oscillations ( @xmath180 ) , one gets from eqs  ( [ rster_sk ] ) and ( [ rster_sno ] ) that : @xmath181 i.e. , the normalized rates in the sk and sno corresponding ranges are expected to be equal ( due to the absence of @xmath182 nc contributions in sk ) .",
    "the above equation is interesting because , independently of the functional form of @xmath104 , it provides a possible way to distinguish pure sterile oscillations [ eq .",
    "( [ mains ] ) ] from pure active oscillations [ eq .  ( [ main ] ) ] .",
    "figure  6 shows , for instance , the `` predicted '' sno spectrum for pure @xmath170 oscillations , as obtained from eq .",
    "( [ mains ] ) . a comparison with fig .",
    "3 ( `` predicted '' sno spectrum for active oscillations ) shows how the normalized sno rates are expected to be less suppressed for the sterile case , on the basis of the present sk data . finally , notice that eq .",
    "( [ mains ] ) does not allow to determine @xmath82 , nor to discriminate pure sterile oscillations from no oscillations .",
    "such loss of predictive power simply reflects the fact that , for increasing amplitude of the @xmath170 channel , there is a decreasing nc contribution in sk , so that the sk and sno event rates tend to be equally suppressed , their combination providing eventually little additional information .",
    "in this work , we have shown that the sk detector response to @xmath0b solar neutrinos , in each bin of the electron energy spectrum above 8 mev , can be accurately approximated by the sno detector response in appropriate ( different ) electron energy ranges . in a sense , it is possible to `` tune '' the sno energy `` bandwidth ''",
    "so as to `` equalize '' the sk response in various spectrum bins .",
    "as a consequence , we have derived a set of linear relations among the sk and sno spectral rates , whose distinguishing feature is the independence on the functional form of the ( active ) neutrino oscillation probability .",
    "such relations can be used to determine the _ absolute _ @xmath0b neutrino flux from sk and sno data , and to cross - check the joint ( non)observation of spectral deviations in the two experiments . as an exercise , pending official sno spectrum data , we have inverted such relations to `` predict '' the sno energy spectrum , on the basis of the current sk data .",
    "we have also discussed the effects and implications of a nonnegligible _ hep _ neutrino flux , of relatively large earth matter effects , and of sterile neutrino transitions .",
    "we conclude by stressing that , should our results be adopted by the sk and sno collaboration to perform a joint sk - sno spectral analysis , dedicated montecarlo simulations would be desirable to assess all the uncertainties and their correlations , as well as to quantify ( through a more detailed description of the instrumental responses ) the approximations associated with our approach .",
