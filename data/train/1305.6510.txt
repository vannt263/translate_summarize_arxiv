    "large volume liquid xenon ( lxe ) detectors are leading the field of dark matter direct detection with the best sensitivity achieved by the xenon100 experiment.@xcite a two order of magnitude improvement in sensitivity is projected by the next generation experiment , xenon1 t  @xcite , which will use more than three tons of xe as target .",
    "xe is extracted from the atmosphere with a typical krypton ( kr ) contamination at the part per million ( ppm ) level .",
    "the kr contamination contributes background events through the radioactive isotope @xmath2kr , which undergoes @xmath3-decay with a 687 kev end point and 10.8 year half - life .",
    "this background from @xmath2kr strongly limits the detection sensitivity of lxe dark matter detectors .",
    "the sensitivity reach of xenon1 t requires a kr / xe contamination below a part per trillion ( ppt ) .",
    "cryogenic distillation is an established technology for xe purification from kr at the ppt level .",
    "however , practical and fast measurements at or below such extremely low levels of contamination are beyond the scope of conventional methods such as low level decay counting  @xcite , mass spectrometers with liquid nitrogen cold traps  @xcite , or accelerator mass spectroscopy.@xcite hence , we have proposed the development of the atom trap trace analysis ( atta ) system described in this paper .",
    "atta systems are based on laser cooling , trapping , and counting of single atoms.@xcite the extraordinary selectivity of the atta method is a result of the high number of resonant photon - atom interactions that are used to slow and capture an atom .",
    "detection of other atomic or molecular species can be excluded at the 90% confidence level even at parts per quadrillion sensitivity.@xcite the photons are generated by a narrow bandwidth laser which is tuned to an isotope - specific optical transition .",
    "the setup which we have developed will allow for a rapid and reliable measurement of kr concentrations in xe at the ppt level , by trapping the most abundant ( 57% ) isotope @xmath4kr .",
    "we can then infer the @xmath2kr concentration since the isotopic abundance of @xmath2kr ( @xmath5 ) is known.@xcite a desired contamination of less than one @xmath2kr in @xmath6 xe atoms thus corresponds to a ppt level contamination of @xmath4kr in xe .",
    "ultra - sensitive kr trace analysis is also used for geological dating and studies of transport processes in the atmosphere , oceans , and groundwater  @xcite , monitoring nuclear - fuel reprocessing activities , and may be of interest for the rare gas industry to guarantee the purity of gases used in a variety of applications .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : apparatus ] , we give a description of our atta device , which consists of the laser and vacuum subsystems , the radio - frequency ( rf ) discharge source , and a single atom detection setup . in sec .",
    "[ sec : characterization ] , we experimentally characterize the parameters which determine the overall system efficiency , and demonstrate the ability to detect single atoms with a good signal to noise ratio . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] we describe the system performance for a xe carrier gas containing ppm kr and show that ppt sensitivity of @xmath4kr detection is expected in @xmath7 hours of measurement time , with further improvements underway .",

    "the pressure in the source chamber is maintained at 0.4 mtorr , while the pressure in the mot chamber remains at @xmath9 torr .",
    "a beam of metastable atoms is created by passing the injected gas sample through a rf discharge region , where inelastic collisions with electrons and ions form a plasma and excite the ground state atoms .",
    "the atomic beam is collimated by two - dimensional optical molasses , slowed by radiation pressure with zeeman tuning , and captured in the mot .",
    "the metastable atoms that are periodically trapped in the mot are detected and counted by their flourescence with an avalanche photodiode ( apd ) . for a known xe gas inflow rate and overall system efficiency ,",
    "the number of detected metastable @xmath4kr * atoms per unit time can be used to determine the @xmath2kr / xe ratio .        to avoid system contamination with kr",
    ", the apparatus has been set up and tested with @xmath10ar * before transitioning to @xmath4kr * in xe .",
    "there are two main sources of contamination at ultra - low kr concentrations .",
    "the first is outgassing from the walls of the vacuum system .",
    "this is however not a significant source of background for ppt - level measurements , at typical gas consumption rates on the order of @xmath11 atoms / s .",
    "@xcite no gas recirculation is used and only metastable atoms are detected , therefore the residual kr downstream from the source chamber does not affect the measurements .",
    "the second source of sample contamination is kr implanted in the walls of the rf discharge source during operation , and becomes important at very low kr concentrations .",
    "@xcite we did not observe this effect at ppm - level measurements of kr in xe , where we operated the discharge with ar for re - alignment between different xe samples .",
    "however , we expect that the system must be operated with pure ar for an extended period of time before switching from reference samples with ppm or part per billion ( ppb ) kr abundance to the ppt - level samples of interest .",
    "@xcite      both @xmath10ar and @xmath4kr have no hyperfine structure , and can be cooled and trapped without the use of optical repumping .",

    "the unshifted beam double - passes a @xmath19 mhz detuned aom for an effective detuning of @xmath20 mhz .",
    "this beam propagates along the zeeman slower axis towards the source , and slows the atomic beam .    the optical coupling into the tapered amplifier and fiber optics introduces laser intensity fluctuations , which limit the signal to noise ratio of single atom detection .",
    "to minimize these fluctuations , a custom - made proportional - integral - derivative ( pid ) control circuit with a photodiode stabilizes the laser intensity of the trapping beams by feedback to the mot aom .",
