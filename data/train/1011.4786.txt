    "networks of coupled oscillators have been the subject of extensive research in the last decade .",
    "coupled systems can display a huge variety of dynamical phenomena , starting from synchronization phenomena in various types of inhomogeneous or irregular networks , up to complex collective behavior , such as for example various forms of phase transitions , traveling waves @xcite , phase - locked patterns , amplitude death states @xcite , or so called chimera states that display a regular pattern of coherent and incoherent motion @xcite .",
    "of particular interest are situations , where complex spatio - temporal structures can emerge in regular arrays of identical units induced only by the coupling interaction . in many cases ,",
    "the resulting phenomena differ substantially from corresponding situations in continuous media @xcite and depend strongly on the underlying network topology .",
    "our specific interest is in the emergence of spatio - temporal structures in a homogeneous array of identical units that have a stable uniform equilibrium at which the coupling vanishes . as a classical paradigm ,",
    "the turing instability gives an example of a coupling induced instability in such a setting .",
    "this phenomenon has of course a direct counterpart in the discrete setting , but it turns out that there appear some genuinely new phenomena . in @xcite it has been shown that also in a ring of unidirectionally coupled oscillators , i.e. in a purely convective setting , the eckhaus scenario of coexisting diffusive patterns can be observed . in @xcite it has been shown that duffing oscillators coupled in the same way , exhibit a complex transition to spatio - temporal chaos . in this paper",
    "we develop a general theoretical framework for such phenomena in large arrays .",
    "we derive an amplitude equation of ginzburg - landau type that governs the local dynamics close to the destabilization of the uniform steady state .",
    "it resembles several features that are already well known in the context of reaction - diffusion systems @xcite .",
    "but in contrast to these results , it can be applied to much more general coupling mechanisms , including also the case of unidirectional and anti - diffusive interaction and allows also for a mixture of such interactions with several next neighbors .",
    "such an interplay of attractive and repulsive coupling is an essential feature of neural systems . as a specific feature , the convective part will appear in the amplitude equation as a rotation of the coordinates in an intermediate time scale that is faster than the diffusive processes described by the ginzburg - landau equation .",
    "having deduced the amplitude equation and the corresponding scaling laws in terms of the number of oscillators , which is assumed to tend to infinity , we use this theory for the explanation of a specific phenomenon that has been reported in @xcite for a ring of unidirectionally coupled duffing oscillators .",
    "there , it has been shown numerically that for a large number of oscillators @xmath0 , there is an almost immediate transition from homogeneous stationary behavior to high - dimensional chaos .",
    "based on our amplitude equation , we argue that in such systems , one can expect generically that such a transition occurs within a parameter interval of the size @xmath1 .",
    "we consider a generic case , where the control parameter enters already the linear parts of the dynamical equations , e.g. a diffusive coupling strength .",
    "finally , we demonstrate this phenomenon by a numerical example , where we also evaluate the scaling behavior of the parameter interval where the transition to chaos takes place for an increasing number of oscillators .",
    "coupled oscillators . apart from the self - coupling @xmath2 each oscillator @xmath3 is also coupled with @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) as well as @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) . see eq .",
    "( [ eq : main ] ) for the equation of motion .",
    "[ fig : ring ] ]    we are interested in a system of @xmath0 identical coupled oscillators that has an uniform equilibrium , where the coupling vanishes . the coupling network is organized in a ring structure , where interactions of several next neighbors are possible .",
    "such systems can be written in general form as @xmath8 where @xmath9 describes the state of the @xmath10-th oscillator .",
    "the ring structure is induced by periodic boundary conditions , i.e. all indexes have to be considered modulo @xmath0 .",
    "the linear part of the dynamics is given by the @xmath11 matrices @xmath12 , depending on the bifurcation parameter @xmath13 , which account for the coupling to the m - th neighbor ; in particular @xmath14 describes the linear part of the local dynamics ( self - coupling ) .",
    "the nonlinear part @xmath15 , again including a local dependence and a dependence on the @xmath16-th neighbor , should vanish at the origin @xmath17 and have also zero derivatives there .",
    "note that this system is symmetric ( equivariant ) with respect to index shift .",
    "figure [ fig : ring ] illustrates an example with self coupling and coupling to the neighbor on the left and to the second neighbor on the right .",
    "the specific form of ( [ eq : main ] ) also implies that the coupling vanishes at the equilibrium @xmath18 , which is true e.g. when the coupling is a function of the difference @xmath19 for any two coupled oscillators @xmath20",
    ".    the characteristic equation for the linearization at the zero equilibrium of ( [ eq : main ] ) can be factorized as @xmath21=0,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 denotes the identity matrix in @xmath23 and the index @xmath24 accounts for the @xmath0-th roots of unity that appear as the eigenvalues of the circular coupling structure @xcite . following the approach in @xcite",
    ", we replace for large @xmath0 the discrete numbers @xmath25 by a continuous parameter @xmath26 , and obtain the _ asymptotic continuous spectrum _",
    "@xmath27=0,\\,\\varphi\\in[0,2\\pi)\\right\\ } , \\label{eq : acs}\\ ] ] which contains all eigenvalues and which for large @xmath0 is covered densely by the eigenvalues .",
    "since the expression ( [ eq : acs ] ) is periodic in @xmath26 , the asymptotic continuous spectrum @xmath28 has generically the form of one or several closed curves @xmath29 in the complex plane , parametrized by @xmath26 .    at the bifurcation value @xmath30 , we assume that the asymptotic continuous spectrum touches the imaginary axis at at some point @xmath31 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : acs ] ) , i.e. the following conditions are fulfilled @xmath32 the first condition from ( [ eq : bifcond ] ) means that the point @xmath31 belongs to the asymptotic continuous spectrum , while the second condition from ( [ eq : bifcond ] ) guarantees that the real part @xmath33 is tangent to the zero axis at @xmath34 ( see fig .  [ fig : acs ] ) .",
    "this tangency condition is quite natural and describes the condition for the destabilization ( or bifurcation ) of the zero solution a large ring of coupled oscillators . indeed ,",
    "if the spectrum @xmath28 is contained in the left half of the complex plane with @xmath35 , then the uniform equilibrium @xmath18 is asymptotically stable .",
    "as soon as @xmath28 crosses the imaginary axis , it becomes unstable for sufficiently large @xmath0 .",
    "asymptotic continuous spectrum @xmath28 at the destabilization ; schematically . ]",
    "before we present our main result , we now introduce some useful notations and formulate a technical lemma , which follows from the bifurcation conditions ( [ eq : bifcond ] ) . with @xmath36 and @xmath37",
    "we denote the eigenvector and the adjoint eigenvector to the critical eigenvalue @xmath38 , which we assumed in ( [ eq : bifcond ] ) to exist for @xmath30 .",
    "moreover , it will be convenient to denote by @xmath39 @xmath40 @xmath41 the `` moments '' of the coupling matrices @xmath42 . in this notation",

    "further , let the bifurcation condition ( [ eq : bifcond ] ) hold",
    ". then @xmath51    the proof of this lemma will be given together with the proof of the main result in section [ sec : proofs ] .",
    "in this section , we present an amplitude equation that describes for system ( [ eq : main ] ) the dynamics close to the destabilization threshold in the limit of large @xmath0 . we perform a limiting procedure , where we assume that a fixed number @xmath52 of neighbors is involved in the coupling while the total number of oscillators @xmath0 tends to infinity .",
    "also the nonlinearity @xmath15 is assumed to depend on @xmath52 next neighbors only .",
    "hence , in the sequel all summation will extend over @xmath53 and the nonlinearity will be written as @xmath54 , independently on @xmath0 . in this way",
    ", the coupling becomes local in the limit @xmath55 , and coupling terms will be approximated by derivatives of the amplitude .",
    "consequently , our results will be valid for large rings , where the coupling range is small compared to the total size .",
    "it will be shown that the amplitude equation has the form of a complex ginzburg - landau equation with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the derivation is quite technical and we give here in proposition 2 only the main assertions .",
    "the proof is deferred to section [ sec : proofs ] .",
    "[ prop2]assume that the bifurcation condition ( [ eq : bifcond ] ) holds and @xmath49 is a regular point of the asymptotic continuous spectrum @xmath56 .",
    "additionally , let the points @xmath57 not belong to the asymptotic continuous spectrum with @xmath34 ( nonresonance condition ) .",
    "let the nonlinearity @xmath15 be of third order . introduce the small parameter @xmath58 and apply the multiple scale ansatz @xmath59 with the amplitude @xmath60 depending on the rescaled coordinates @xmath61 @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( @xmath64 denotes complex conjugated terms , @xmath65 ) to the following system    @xmath66    with the rescaled parameter @xmath67 and @xmath68 with periodic boundary conditions .",

    "@xmath80 can be approximated in the form ( [ eq : multscale ] ) , where the amplitude @xmath74 is related to a solution of the ginzburg - landau equation ( [ eq : gl ] ) via ( [ eq : au ] ) .",
    "note that the relation ( [ eq : au ] ) introduces a rotating frame on the timescale @xmath81 with rotation velocity @xmath82 the time evolution of the ginzburg - landau equation enters only on the slowest time scale @xmath83 .",

    "note that due to our assumption , @xmath15 is of third order and the leading order terms are given by expanding @xmath108 in the homogeneous state @xmath109 with respect to @xmath110 .",
    "the solvability condition requires that different harmonics as well as different orders of @xmath100 up to @xmath101 are equal .",
    "we start with the first harmonic . by equating the terms containing @xmath111",
    "we obtain the following equation    @xmath112 @xmath113 since it should be satisfied for all @xmath100 , we first consider the @xmath114 equation @xmath115 which holds according to the spectral condition ( [ eq : v0 ] ) .",

    "finally , note that the set of equations should be complemented by periodic boundary conditions in @xmath130 , taking into account the ring structure of system ( [ eq : perteq ] ) .",
    "the proposition is proved .",
    "it is well known that in the complex ginzburg - landau equation ( [ eq : gl ] ) a destabilization transition is possible , where in a series of bifurcations a homogeneous stationary state loses its stability and , via periodic and quasiperiodic motion , a regime of spatio - temporal chaos appears @xcite .",
    "we will now use the result about the amplitude equation in order to trace back this destabilization transition to the original coupled oscillator system of the form ( [ eq : main ] ) .",
    "specific attention will be paid to the scaling behavior of the parameter region where this transition takes place .    starting with the scale free amplitude equation @xmath131 with periodic boundary conditions",
    ", we assume that at @xmath132 a destabilization of the homogeneous stationary state takes place and for further increasing parameter @xmath133 a transition to spatio - temporal chaos can be observed .",
    "this transition takes place within some bounded interval @xmath134 considering now the corresponding behavior of an oscillator system that is described by this amplitude equation , we have to introduce the scalings given in proposition [ prop2 ] .",
    "in particular , according to the parameter scaling @xmath135 , the same transition takes place in the coupled oscillator system within a parameter interval @xmath136 of the corresponding parameter @xmath13 of the oscillator system .",
    "therefore , one can expect that a generic transition to chaos ( or hyperchaos ) in the system of @xmath0 coupled oscillators occurs within a parameter interval that scales as @xmath1 . in the following section , we present an example where the assumptions that we made above are satisfied and , consequently , in the oscillator system an almost immediate transition from stationary behavior to chaos can be observed .",
    "in the previous section we discussed the scaling law for the transition to chaos in a ring of coupled oscillators . in this section",
    "we provide a numerical example to illustrate this scaling .",
    "we use the autonomous duffing oscillator described by the following second order ordinary differential equation    @xmath137    where @xmath138 and @xmath139 are positive constants . system ( [ eq : duff_single ] ) is a single - well duffing oscillator , which has a single equilibrium point at @xmath140 . due to the presence of damping @xmath141 this equilibrium is an attractor for all initial conditions .",
    "we consider now a ring of @xmath0 such oscillators with a linear unidirectional coupling to the next neighbor .",

    "a detailed analysis of the behavior of this system was already presented in @xcite . for at least three coupled oscillators and increasing coupling strength @xmath145",
    ", one can observe rich dynamics starting from periodic oscillations to hyperchaos .",
    "here we focus our attention on the transition to chaos ( hyperchaos ) and its dependence on the number of oscillators . in our numerics , we used the fixed parameter values @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "we calculated the maximum lyapunov exponents for increasing @xmath0 and varying coupling coefficient @xmath145 .",
    "based on this , we determined two values : @xmath148 where the uniform stationary state loses its stability in a hopf bifurcation , and @xmath149 where the transition to chaos takes place . a reliable computation of the lyapunov exponents was possible only for moderate values of @xmath0 ( @xmath150 ) . for larger systems , we monitored the behavior in an appropriately chosen poincare section in order to determine @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "[ fig : values - of - coupling](a ) shows that for increasing @xmath0 the distance between @xmath148 and @xmath149 decreases .",

    "the results of this paper are twofold .",
    "the first one is more theoretical : we have derived an amplitude equation for small amplitude solutions of a ring system of coupled oscillators .",
    "this equation has the form of a complex ginzburg - landau equation with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "such an amplitude equation is typical for reaction - diffusion systems @xcite in continuous media and can also be found for systems with large delay @xcite .",
    "obviously , a similar behavior should be expected in discrete systems with diffusive coupling .",
    "however , our results show that in coupled oscillator systems the ginzburg - landau equation can also be used to describe the dynamics in systems with unidirectional , i.e. purely convective coupling or even with anti - diffusive interaction . in this sense , the class of coupled oscillators that we treated in this paper differs substantially from discrete analogs of the classical results for continuous media .    for the second result , we applied the amplitude equation to the specific scenario of the transition to spatio - temporal chaos in such systems . in this way",
    ", we provided a general framework for the coupling induced transition to high dimensional chaos in coupled oscillator systems , that has been described for a specific example in @xcite .",
    "in particular , we were able to show that the observed fast transition to chaos is a generic feature and follows a @xmath1 scaling law for systems with a large number @xmath0 of oscillators .",
    "as a result of this scaling , one observes for large systems a practically immediate transition from a uniform stationary state to chaos .",
    "we illustrated this behavior by a numerical example , where the emergence of high dimensional chaos is demonstrated by corresponding lyapunov spectra .",
