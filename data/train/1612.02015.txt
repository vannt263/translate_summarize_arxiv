    "our understanding of the connection between supermassive black holes and their host galaxies is anchored by @xmath3100 dynamical black hole mass ( @xmath11 ) measurements that have been made over the past two decades ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* and references therein ) .",
    "strong correlations have emerged between @xmath11 and large - scale galaxy properties , like the bulge luminosity ( @xmath12 ; e.g. , @xcite ) or mass ( @xmath13 ; e.g. , @xcite ) , and the stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath14 ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these relations are connected to each other , and the search for the most fundamental one is still ongoing @xcite .",
    "the empirical relationships imply that black holes are key components of galaxies and regulate galaxy properties via feedback mechanisms @xcite , although a non - causal origin in which black holes do not actively shape their host galaxies is also possible @xcite .",
    "establishing the exact role of black holes in galaxy evolution and accurately inferring the black hole mass function requires increasing the number of @xmath11 measurements , specifically targeting galaxies with diverse properties that have experienced varied growth channels .",
    "as we begin to examine a broader range of black hole masses and hosts , galaxies with different structural properties show surprises in the scaling relations .",
    "recent progress detecting high - mass black holes in brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) and other large early - type galaxies hint that these objects may be positive outliers from @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but there are still too few measurements to firmly characterize the scaling relations at @xmath17 .",
    "the uncertainties are equally severe at the opposite end , where spiral galaxies with low - mass black holes ( @xmath18 ) measured from water megamaser disks exhibit substantial scatter below the global black hole",

    "like the @xmath10 red nuggets , ngc 1277 and ngc 1271 have small effective radii of @xmath19 kpc , stellar masses of @xmath20 , and stellar mass surface density profiles that are elevated at the center and drop off steeply at larger radii compared to low - redshift early - type galaxies . in addition , ngc 1277 and ngc 1271 are rotating , consistent with the disk - like flattened structures of the @xmath10 red nuggets @xcite , and have uniformly old stellar populations ( ages of @xmath310 gyr ) extending out to several @xmath21 .",
    "the red nuggets are thought to grow in size and moderately in mass through mergers to produce the present - day massive galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with a small fraction experiencing passive evolution since @xmath10 ( e.g. , * ? ?",

    "ngc 1277 and ngc 1271 appear to be such relics of the red nuggets , and could provide the unique opportunity to gain insight into the black holes at earlier epochs .    of the current galaxies with dynamical @xmath11 measurements ,",
    "ngc 1277 and ngc 1271 are most similar to ngc 4342 @xcite and ngc 1332 .",

    "they contain black holes that are more massive than the predictions from @xmath16 , yet are consistent with @xmath22 .",

    "* ) , although we note that ngc 1332 may very well be consistent with the black hole relations given the uncertainties associated with both @xmath11 @xcite and the bulge component @xcite .",
    "clearly , additional mass measurements of black holes in ngc 1277-like galaxies are needed .",
    "a significant sample of local analogs to the @xmath10 red nuggets that are also positive outliers from @xmath23 would suggest that this black hole scaling relation did not apply at earlier times , galaxies instead harbored over - massive black holes , and subsequent galaxy growth had yet to occur .    beyond the connections to the @xmath10 red nuggets , the compact galaxies are interesting because they occupy the sparsely populated upper - end of the @xmath11 relationships , and their properties are quite distinct from the bcgs and giant ellipticals that are expected to house the most massive black holes in the universe .",
    "currently , at the high - mass end , the differing behaviors of @xmath22 and @xmath16 , and the poorly characterized scatter in @xmath11 for fixed @xmath14 or @xmath12 , lead to strongly divergent predictions of the black hole mass function @xcite .",

    "the psf was generated with tinytim @xcite for the @xmath32 filter and a g2  v star at the center of the wfc3 detector , then drizzled to produce the same scale as our final mrk 1216 image .",
    "the mrk 1216 mge is composed of 10 gaussians with dispersions , measured along the major axis , of 009@xmath332976 , and projected axis ratios between 0.52 and 0.99 .",

    "four blocks of consecutive object - sky - object sequences with 600 s exposures were recorded .",
    "the observations were acquired with the @xmath36 filter and the @xmath1 grating centered on @xmath37 @xmath38 m .",

    "the normal baseline calibrations consisting of dark frames , flat fields , argon / xeon arc lamp exposures , and a ronchi mask ( to establish the spatial rectification ) were taken as well .",
    "we processed the nifs data using pyraf and the gemini data reduction package version 1.11 , following the steps in the nifs example scripts for calibration , telluric , and science exposures . for the galaxy , the basic procedure consisted of preparing the raw images for processing within the nifs data reduction package , subtracting sky frames from adjacent object exposures , flat fielding , removing bad pixels and cosmic rays , wavelength calibration , and spatial rectification .",
    "we corrected for telluric features using an a0  v star , whose spectrum had been divided by a blackbody with a temperature of 9480 k after interpolating over the br@xmath39 absorption line .",
    "we then assembled data cubes having @xmath40 and @xmath41 spatial dimensions , each with a scale of 005 pixel@xmath0 , and a wavelength axis .",
    "we determined the spatial offsets between individual galaxy cubes by summing over the wavelength dimension and cross - correlating the images .",
    "these eight cubes , corresponding to a total of 1.3 hours on - source , were aligned and combined to produce the final mrk 1216 data cube .",

    ", we measured the stellar kinematics as a function of spatial location .",
    "specifically , we extracted the line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) , parameterized by the first four gauss - hermite moments , in 67 voronoi spatial bins @xcite using the penalized pixel fitting ( ppxf ) code of @xcite .",
    "the spatial bins were chosen so that the galaxy spectra had a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) @xmath42 40 , where the s / n was measured as the median flux divided by the standard deviation of the ppxf model residuals .",
    "such a high s / n spectrum is required in order to measure the losvd s deviation from a gaussian ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we provided ppxf with a velocity template library composed of 12 stars ( k0@xmath33m5 giant stars and two late - type supergiants ) , which were observed with nifs in the @xmath1 band .",
    "the stars are a subset of those presented in @xcite , but we have reduced the data ourselves @xcite , starting with the raw frames and their calibration files retrieved from the gemini science archive . during the fit with ppxf , we corrected for slight differences in the continuum shape and equivalent width between the losvd - convolved template stars and the observed galaxy spectra via an additive constant and a multiplicative legendre polynomial of degree 1 .",
    "the losvd was largely constrained by the strong @xmath43co(2@xmath330 ) and @xmath43co(3@xmath331 ) bandheads , which were contained within the @xmath44 @xmath38 m fitting region .",
    "we masked the absorption line because our template library does not include cool dwarf stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "example fits with ppxf to the observed galaxy spectra located at the nucleus , in an intermediate region , and in one of the outermost spatial bins are given in figure [ fig : nifs_specfit ] .    after an initial fit to the galaxy spectrum in each spatial bin , we ran a monte carlo simulation with 100 iterations . during each realization",

    ", we took the mean to be the kinematic value and the standard deviation to be the 1@xmath8 uncertainty .",
    "finally , we point - symmetrize the kinematics using the method described in @xcite , which also removes the systematic offsets in the odd gauss - hermite moments .    the resulting radial velocity ( @xmath45 ) map shows that mrk 1216 is rotating , such that the southwest side of the galaxy is blueshifted and the northeast side is redshifted with values of @xmath46180 km s@xmath0 .",

    "the parameter was not well constrained by the 2d line - of - sight kinematics @xcite .",
    "therefore , we determined the effect on @xmath11 and @xmath58 if a near edge - on angle of @xmath84 is used instead .",
    "we find that @xmath11 decreases by 22% to @xmath85 and @xmath58 changes by 23% to @xmath86 .    by adding in quadrature the 1@xmath8 formal model fitting uncertainty and the percent change in the best - fit values relative to the fiducial model above",

    "in addition , our dynamical @xmath6-band mass - to - light ratio is in agreement with expectations from stellar population synthesis models for both a kroupa ( @xmath92 ) and a salpeter ( @xmath93 ) initial mass function , assuming solar metallicity and a @xmath313 gyr age @xcite . given the black hole mass of @xmath94 and the bulge stellar velocity dispersion of 308 km s@xmath0 ( see section [ sec : bhgalrels ] ) , the nifs data , with a central 01 spatial bin , have easily resolved the 049 black hole sphere of influence .",
    "the ppak data cube provides an increase in 2d spatial coverage , more spatial bins , smaller uncertainties on the extracted kinematics , and better spectral resolution than the het long - slit spectroscopy .",
    "thus , we use the ppak kinematics in place of the het kinematics when constructing the dynamical models .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the radial form of the stellar mass - to - light ratio ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this comes at the expense of larger @xmath11 statistical uncertainties due to the poor constraint on @xmath58 .",
    "results of fitting orbit - based models to the nifs kinematics alone are shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : contours_nifsppak_nifs ] , and we find that @xmath97 and @xmath98 ( 1@xmath8 ) .    finally , the nifs kinematics were measured using an additive constant and a degree 1 multiplicative polynomial to account for differences in continuum shape between the velocity template library and the observed galaxy spectra .",
    "we consider these nifs kinematics robust , as changes to how ppxf is run ( see section [ subsec : nifs_kinematics ] ) produce similar kinematics . however , slight adjustments to the degree of the additive / multiplicative polynomials can cause inconsistent kinematics at the 1@xmath8 level ( all are consistent within 2@xmath8 ) .",
    "in particular , one of the largest differences is seen when running ppxf with a multiplicative degree 2 polynomial ( with no additive component ) , which produces 11 spatial bins in which the kinematics differ by more than 1@xmath8 relative to our adopted set of nifs kinematics .",
    "if instead we use the nifs kinematics extracted with ppxf and a multiplicative degree 2 polynomial , we infer @xmath99 and @xmath100 ( 1@xmath8 ) .",

    "since this double sersic model produced pronounced residuals , @xcite increased the number of sersic functions to four to obtain a good fit to the galaxy s complex structure .",
    "each of the four components , however , have rather low sersic indices between 0.99 and 1.61 , which complicates a morphological classification . a dynamical decomposition using orbital weights from the @xcite best - fit schwarzschild model support the picture depicted by the 4-component photometric decomposition .",

    "@xcite calculate a larger total luminosity for ngc 1277 based on modeling the 1d light profile , however their mge model suggests a smaller total luminosity than the one adopted here ( their mge model has 43% less light than their 1d component analysis ) .",

    "@xcite conclude that @xmath22 is the best empirical relationship available and that a multi - variate scaling relation between @xmath11 , @xmath142 and @xmath21 is a projection of @xmath22 with an equal amount of intrinsic scatter .",
    "previous attempts to explore whether the inclusion of an additional parameter leads to tighter scaling relations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have also generally found no significant decreases in the amount of intrinsic scatter compared to the single - parameter @xmath22 relation .",

    "the three het compact galaxies are in the compilation of @xcite . with this new black hole mass and luminosities derived from the _ hst _ images",
    ", we find that mrk 1216 and ngc 1271 , are within @xmath3@xmath143 of the black hole mass  galaxy luminosity  galaxy size relation correlation , and that ngc 1277 is consistent with the relation , given the intrinsic scatter .",
    "future work on multi - variate scaling relations requires overcoming a sampling bias in the known @xmath11 hosts ; currently there is a very limited spread in effective radii at a given @xmath1-band galaxy luminosity @xcite .",
    "mrk 1216 hosts one of the largest black holes dynamically detected to date , naturally leading to the question of how such a massive black hole ended up in a relatively modest galaxy .",
    "one interesting explanation is that mrk 1216 is a relic of the @xmath10 quiescent galaxies , and avoided the same series of mergers that produced the typical massive early - type galaxies of today .",
    "mrk 1216 perhaps reflects an earlier period when galaxies contained over - massive black holes for their bulge luminosities / masses , and galaxy growth had yet to follow .",
    "such a scenario has been proposed to explain the locations of ngc 1277 and ngc 1271 on the black hole scaling relations based upon having small effective radii for the stellar masses , stellar mass surface density profiles comparable to the @xmath10 red nuggets , and a uniformly old stellar population out to several @xmath21 ( e.g. , @xcite ; yildirim et  al .",
    "2016b , in prep ) .",
    "mrk 1216 is akin to ngc 1277 and ngc 1271 , and is similar to the @xmath10 red nuggets .",

    "2016b , in prep ) .",

    "mrk 1216 has one of the largest effective radii ( @xmath24 kpc ) in our sample of compact galaxies found through the het massive galaxy survey , and the stellar mass surface density profile is more extended in the outer regions ( yildirim et  al . 2016b , in prep ) . with future work",
    ", it would be informative to study mrk 1216 s stellar population over the extent of the galaxy .",
    "another possible explanation for the location of mrk 1216 on the @xmath16 and @xmath130 relations is that we simply do not have enough measurements at the upper - end of the correlations . with the limited number of objects in this high - mass regime ,",
    "neither the form of the correlations nor the magnitude and distribution of the scatter are well determined ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . therefore , mrk 1216 could fall in the tails of a distribution between black hole mass and galaxy properties that still needs to be fully flushed out .",
    "we note that many of the compact galaxies in the het massive galaxy survey have nuclear dust disks , indicating the presence of cleanly rotating gas @xcite , from which independent black hole mass measurements can be derived for comparison to the stellar - dynamical determinations .",
    "such cross - checks between mass measurement methods is essential for establishing the amount of intrinsic scatter in the black hole correlations , and eventually for assessing how strongly mrk 1216 , ngc 1277 , and ngc 1271 deviate from the relations .",
    "presently , a majority of the meaningful comparisons between the stellar and gas - dynamical methods have led to discrepancies where the stellar - dynamical @xmath11 exceeds the gas - dynamical mass by factors of @xmath144 @xcite , although there are a very small number of direct comparison studies .",
    "finally , over - massive black holes can result from tidal stripping events .",
    "this idea was used to explain the low - mass galaxy m60-ucd1 , which lies a mere 6.6 kpc away from the giant elliptical galaxy m60 @xcite . indeed",
    ", the eagle cosmological , hydrodynamical simulation @xcite shows that tidal stripping is the dominant process responsible for the extreme outliers from the @xmath145 correlation , but the simulation is most sensitive to galaxies with @xmath146 and @xmath147 . due to the limited box size",
    ", predictions can not be made for more massive ngc 1277-like galaxies @xcite .",
    "contrary to ngc 1277 and ngc 1271 , which are members of the perseus cluster , mrk 1216 is an isolated galaxy in the field , with only two other galaxies within 1 mpc at its distance @xcite .",
    "combined with the regular isophotes and lack of tidal signatures in the _ hst _ image , the idea that mrk 1216 was once the center of a more massive galaxy seems unlikely .",
    "in summary , we measured the 2d stellar kinematics of the compact , high - dispersion galaxy mrk 1216 using newly acquired ao nifs observations that probe within the black hole sphere of influence .",
    "mrk 1216 is rotating , has a distinct rise in the stellar velocity dispersion at the nucleus , exhibits the expected anti - correlation between @xmath45 and @xmath47 , and has elevated central @xmath49 values . the high angular resolution nifs kinematics , along with large - scale kinematic measurements and the luminous mass model from an _ hst _ image , are fit with stellar - dynamical models based upon the schwarzschild superposition method .",
    "we constrain the mass of the central black hole in mrk 1216 to be @xmath148 and the @xmath6-band stellar mass - to - light ratio to be @xmath149 .",
    "the error budget incorporates some possible systematic effects and the formal 1@xmath8 model fitting uncertainties .    with @xmath26 km s@xmath0 , mrk",
    "1216 is consistent with the @xmath22 relationship , but is a surprising positive outlier from @xmath16 and @xmath130 , even when conservatively using the galaxy s total luminosity and stellar mass of @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "mrk 1216 is similar to ngc 1277 and ngc 1271  the two compact , high - dispersion galaxies from the het massive galaxy survey that have prior stellar - dynamical @xmath11 measurements from ao observations .",
    "all three galaxies resemble the quiescent galaxies at @xmath152 given their small but massive nature , their stellar mass surface density profiles , their strong rotation , and ( in the cases of ngc 1277 and ngc 1271 ) their uniformly old stellar populations .",
    "therefore , mrk 1216 , as well as ngc 1277 and ngc 1271 , appear to be relics of the @xmath10 red nuggets , and their black holes may imply that the normalization of the @xmath23 and @xmath130 relations were higher at earlier times . in other words , perhaps black hole growth precedes that of its host galaxy .",
    "another possibility is that the galaxies are simply unusual and are in the tail of a distribution between @xmath11 and galaxy properties that still needs to be firmly established .",
