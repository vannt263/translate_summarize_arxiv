    "solid glass corner cube prisms ( or , more generally , corner cube retroreflectors or ccrs ) are used in interferometers , surveying references , gravimeters , and for laser ranging to satellites and the moon .",
    "ccrs may either have a metallic reflective coating on the rear surface , such as silver or aluminum , or be uncoated to operate via total internal reflection ( tir ) . within @xmath0 of normal - incidence ,",
    "tir ccrs reflect 100% of the incident light at any azimuthal angle , ignoring reflection losses at the front surface ( which may be anti - reflection coated ) .",
    "comparatively , silver coatings operating at 96% will lose 12% of the flux due to three rear surface reflections , and aluminum coatings at 91% will sacrifice 25% of the light . for some applications ,",
    "absorption of incident light ( e.g. , sunlight ) by the reflective coating results in strong thermal gradients within the prism , in turn leading to phase distortions that disturb the far - field diffraction pattern . in these cases ,",
    "tir cubes are preferred .",
    "on the other hand , coated corner cubes have little effect on the input polarization state , so that in the absence of thermal gradients or other distorting influences , the far - field diffraction pattern from such a corner cube will approach that of a perfect airy pattern corresponding to the circular aperture of the corner cube .",
    "tir corner cubes , by contrast , generally introduce elliptical polarization at each reflection .",
    "each of the six surface sequence permutations will in general produce a different output polarization , corresponding to phase offsets between the six paths .",
    "the resulting far - field diffraction pattern for a fused silica ccr has a central intensity only 26% that of the perfect reflector case .",
    "only 36.1% of the total flux falls within a radius of @xmath1corresponding to the first null in the airy pattern  where @xmath2 is the wavelength and @xmath3 is the diameter of the corner cube aperture .",
    "the comparable measure for the airy function is 83.8% .",
    "the literature contains a number of papers describing polarization and diffraction of tir ccrs , but some are inconsistent with each other , and none of them provide an adequate framework for a comprehensive assessment of ccr performance compatible with our goals . specifically , peck ( 1962 )",
    "@xcite finds polarization eigenmodes for tir ccrs at normal incidence  primarily with an interest in using ccrs in optical cavities .",
    "liu and azzam ( 1995 ) @xcite offer a comprehensive treatment of the polarization states emerging from tir ccrs , along with laboratory measurements of stokes parameters .",
    "the focus follows that of peck : calculating eigenmodes in a coordinate system that has a reflection relative to the input coordinates .",
    "hodgson and chipman ( 1990 ) @xcite also present laboratory data along with a mathematical development , but we find the results to be incompatible with ours and other works  as if the solid cube under examination employed reflective coatings rather than tir .",
    "scholl ( 1995 )",
    "@xcite performs raytrace analysis to track the state of the electric field within imperfect corner cubes , but does not treat tir explicitly .",
    "chang et al . ( 1971 ) @xcite provide an impressive analytic calculation of the far - field diffraction pattern of a tir ccr at normal incidence and linear input polarization , along with some useful quantitative handles .",
    "this paper also separates the diffraction patterns into orthogonal polarization states and provides laboratory checks on the results , which prompted us to use this paper as a useful standard against which to compare our normal - incidence linear polarization results . in a related vein , arnold produced a series of special reports on methods for calculating ccr transfer functions @xcite .",
    "most recently , sadovnikov and sokolov ( 2009 ) @xcite , and later sokolov and murashkin ( 2011 ) @xcite , contribute a work most similar to our own , presenting diagrams of polarization and diffraction patterns at different input polarizations for the normal incidence case .",
    "however , the works were not readily adaptable to our needs because : 1 ) coordinate systems and plotting conventions are not clearly described ; 2 ) the corner cubes considered do not appear to be circularly cut ; and 3 ) the presentation is not geared toward instructing readers on how to develop their own analysis capability  as this work aims to do .",
    "our ultimate goal is to assess the far - field diffraction pattern from tir ccrs subject to thermal gradients for application in our lunar laser ranging project @xcite ( see the companion paper on thermal gradients within ccrs @xcite ) . because the target ccr is in relative tangential motion with respect to the line of sight , velocity aberration shifts the pattern relative to our receiving telescope .",
    "we therefore sample the shoulder of the central diffraction peak , and thus are not content with knowledge of the central irradiance of the diffraction pattern . even though the lunar ccrs are designed to minimize thermal gradients , we observe strong evidence that thermal gradients are developing at certain lunar phases ",
    "likely due to solar illumination of dust deposited on the front faces of the prisms @xcite .",
    "we have found the existing literature to be insufficient for prescribing analysis algorithms that we might emulate , and further found inadequate published experimental results against which to verify our results .",
    "we describe here a technique to analyze corner cube polarization and diffraction patterns at arbitrary angles of incidence that should be straightforward to program into a computer language ( we used python , and make our code available online ) .",
    "moreover , we display graphical output of polarization states and of diffraction patterns that should be useful for comparison and as a demonstration of the general behavior of tir ccr diffraction .",
    "laboratory polarization measurements confirm the analysis , and far - field diffraction patterns verify the final result .",
    "figure  [ fig : ccr - geom ] depicts the geometry and orientation of a circularly cut ccr within a global right - handed cartesian coordinate system .",
    "rear faces are labeled a , b , and c , so that a particular ray path through the ccr can be labeled as acb , for instance .",
    "the three normal vectors for the rear surfaces form an orthonormal set:@xmath4 we define the distant observer s angular position relative to the ccr by an azimuth , @xmath5measured from the @xmath6axis and increasing toward the @xmath7axis  and an inclination , @xmath8away from the @xmath9axis , so that @xmath10 .",
    "snell s law can be applied at the ccr front face to redirect an incident light ray into a new @xmath11 , while reflection within the ccr changes the ray direction according to @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the surface normal in question .",
    "we define a frame for input polarization that we associate with horizontal ( @xmath14 ) and vertical ( @xmath15 ) in such a way that the horizontal unit vector is perpendicular to both @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which itself is the front surface normal .",
    "explicitly , @xmath18 where @xmath5 , again , is the azimuth of the observer .",
    "we will present both input and output polarization states in the globally - referenced observer frame of eq .",
    "[ eq : s0-p0 ] , which will ultimately require a coordinate flip owing to the retroreflection .",
    "on approach to each interface one must transform into the local @xmath19 and @xmath20 coordinate system corresponding to directions perpendicular and parallel to the plane of incidence , respectively .",
    "the @xmath19@xmath20 frame is described by@xmath21 which happens to be aligned with the global @xmath6@xmath7 frame for light approaching the corner cube from azimuth @xmath22 , and appearing right - handed if looking along @xmath11 .",
    "the transformation between some arbitrary @xmath23@xmath24 frame perpendicular to the propagation direction and the @xmath19@xmath20 frame for the upcoming surface interface can be determined from the four - quadrant arctangent@xmath25 as depicted in figure  [ fig : coord - ellipse ] .",
    "after the interface  whether refractive or reflective  the propagation direction , @xmath11 , is altered by some rotation about the @xmath26 direction .",
    "consequently , @xmath26 is unchanged at a single interface , while @xmath27 must be re - evaluated according to eq .",
    "[ eq : s - p - def ] .",
    "as one steps through the corner cube , the @xmath26 and @xmath27 vectors become the @xmath28 and @xmath29 vectors for the next application of eq .",
    "[ eq : alpha - det ] .    for reference ,",
    "the rotation angles , @xmath30 , for all six path sequences through the corner cube at normal incidence are given in table  [ tab : rotations ] , where the initial @xmath23@xmath24 coordinate system is aligned to the global @xmath6@xmath7 frame ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the last rotation , @xmath32 , aligns the final @xmath27 vector with @xmath33 , while the retroreflection ( @xmath34 ) results in a coordinate flip so that @xmath26 points along @xmath35",
    ".    .rotation sequences , in degrees[tab : rotations ] [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath36for normal incidence , horizontal input polarization      using a fused silica ccr and a hene laser at 632.8  nm , we directed a high - purity ( @xmath37:1 intensity ratio ) linear polarization state into each path sequence in turn , characterizing the emerging elliptical polarization state in terms of major and minor axes ( taking the square root of measured intensity to find electric field amplitude ) , angle of the axis , and rotation sense with the help of a high - precision quarter - wave plate .",
    "the quarter - wave plate also provided an independent check of the ellipse axis ratio  this time directly as an electric field ratio .",
    "we employed a separate precision quarter - wave plate to send circular polarization into the ccr , confirming an axis ratio of 0.99 in amplitude .",
    "figure  [ fig : pol - meas ] shows the results for two cases , in a format similar to that of previous plots .",
    "we found in practice that the measured ellipse properties deviated more than we expected , given the purity of input polarization ( see , for instance , the minor axis variations for the circular polarization case in figure  [ fig : pol - meas ] ) . anomalies did not follow the ccr upon a @xmath38 rotation of the ccr with respect to the optical bench , but stayed fixed in the laboratory frame , suggesting that the discrepancy resides in the measurement setup .",
    "the orientation of the major axis tends to be robust ( within @xmath39 ) , as this is a result of gross rotations ( projections ) of the input electric field vectors  both of which are controlled or known to adequate precision .",
    "the axis ratio , however , is very sensitive to phase differences between orthogonal polarizations , and could vary substantially . for the circular polarization case in figure  [ fig : pol - meas ] ,",
    "the minor axis amplitude varies from 0.16 to 0.34 ( expecting 0.17 ) , while the corresponding phase differences ( @xmath40 , evaluated in a frame where the major axis has @xmath41 ) remain within @xmath42 of theoretical expectations . for the linear polarization case",
    ", phase differences stayed within @xmath43 of the expected values .",
    "given the high degree of fidelity we observe in the far - field diffraction patterns  as demonstrated below ",
    "we conclude that the polarization states are indeed following the model closely , even if the results in figure  [ fig : pol - meas ] do not appear to be an exact match .",
    "the far - field diffraction pattern can be conveniently calculated via the fourier transform ( ft ) of the complex amplitude and phase of the electric field at the exit aperture of the corner cube .",
    "the ft integrates area - weighted amplitude and phase contributions at the aperture , resulting in the net sum  or interference  of the electric field at infinite distance as a function of angular displacement from the propagation direction .",
    "the square magnitude of the ft then represents the intensity in the far - field:@xmath44\\exp\\left[ik(\\chi u+\\eta v)\\right]\\mathrm{d}u\\mathrm{d}v\\right|^{2},\\label{eq : fourier - transform}\\ ] ] where the aperture amplitude , @xmath45 , and phase , @xmath46 , are functions of coordinates @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the aperture plane .",
    "the coordinates @xmath47 and @xmath48 then represent angular coordinates in the far - field , with @xmath49 .",
    "orthogonal polarizations can not interfere with each other , so the fourier transform must be broken into separate computations for any two orthogonal polarizations . for each , the phases are simply the final @xmath50 and @xmath51 phases resulting from the transformation of the final values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 computed via sequential applications of eq .",
    "[ eq : fresnel - shift ] into some final @xmath23@xmath24 coordinate frame .",
    "each wedge in the aperture  corresponding to each of the six unique path sequences  will have constant phase across the wedge .",
    "the aperture function can be determined during preparation for the fourier transform , in that one must pass to the integral a two - dimensional array of aperture amplitudes in the input @xmath23@xmath24 frame . by raytracing a grid of input ray positions sharing the same input @xmath11 vector ,",
    "one can determine which rays emerge by rejecting any ray that encounters any of the four ccr planes outside the cylindrical radius of the ccr .",
    "the resulting aperture for non - normal incidence has a shape given by the included intersection of two equal ellipses shifted relative to one another along their minor axes , each one representing the projected rim of the entrance aperture and the retro - reflected rendition of the same .",
    "the raytrace also determines which sequence ( wedge ) applies , and thus which amplitudes among the set of six pre - computed @xmath54 and @xmath55 values are to be used for @xmath56 .",
    "one can readily compute the central irradiance , @xmath57 , of the far - field diffraction pattern in the normal incidence case simply by summing the aperture function , @xmath56 , times the phase function , @xmath58 $ ] , equally weighted for all six wedges . in the trivial case",
    "where @xmath59 inside a circular aperture of radius @xmath60 while @xmath46 is constant , we get a central irradiance of @xmath61 . summing the values in table  [ tab : amp - phase - ex ] ( where @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) , each weighted by @xmath64 , we get a central irradiance for the @xmath6-component of : @xmath65 and a @xmath7-component summing to zero .",
    "thus the total central irradiance of the tir diffraction pattern is 26.4% of what it would be for a perfect airy pattern .",
    "combining this with reflection loss from an uncoated fused silica front surface ( incurred twice ) puts the central irradiance at 24.6% that of the airy pattern for a circular aperture of the same diameter .    we can develop a useful tool for computing the expected central irradiance in the far - field diffraction pattern if we characterize all the flux as being contained in a tophat pattern whose uniform intensity is set to that of the central peak of the actual diffraction pattern",
    "this crude model permits a simple estimation of the central intensity , once the tophat diameter is known .",
    "expressed in terms of the diffraction scale , an uncoated fused silica ccr is characterized by a tophat diameter of 2.56@xmath66 . for the apollo corner cubes at 532  nm ,",
    "this is 7.4  arcsec .",
    "the corresponding measure for a perfect airy pattern is 1.27@xmath66 .",
    "conversely , if we conveniently  albeit navely  modeled the diffraction pattern as containing all the flux within a tophat diameter set to @xmath66 , we find that the central irradiance of the actual pattern is reduced to 0.152 times the nominal value suggested by the simple @xmath66 tophat model .",
    "reflection losses at the front surface degrade the performance further .",
    "in the diffraction patterns we present , the orientation convention is in keeping with those in the rest of the paper : looking at the corner cube .",
    "thus the global @xmath67 direction is to the right , and @xmath68 is up .",
    "direction cosines are plotted , so that light arriving at positive-@xmath6 global coordinates in the far field are shown to the right .",
    "if projected onto a screen at infinity , each of the images here would incur a left - right flip .",
    "the horizontal direction follows that used to define polarization , being perpendicular to the plane of incidence and therefore lying in the global @xmath6@xmath7 plane .    at normal incidence ,",
    "the azimuthal orientation of the input polarization impacts the output polarization state , as seen in figure  [ fig : lin - pol - out ] .",
    "following the same ccr rotation sequence and input polarization as was used in figure  [ fig : lin - pol - out ] , we produce the far - field diffraction patterns in figure  [ fig : ffpat - lin - normal - az ] .",
    "the polarization state of the central peak follows that of the input polarization .",
    "the total diffraction pattern rotates by @xmath38 as the polarization rotates through @xmath69 in the opposite direction , producing a net @xmath70 rotation of the pattern with respect to the polarization state  just as the polarization ellipses did in figure  [ fig : lin - pol - out ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : cuts - vs - airy ] shows two profiles through the normal incidence tir ccr diffraction pattern compared to the scaled airy pattern .",
    "the two profiles correspond to orthogonal cuts through the center of the pattern in the upper - left panel of figure  [ fig : ffpat - lin - normal - az ] , one of which passes through two outer lobes , and the other passing between lobes .",
    "the plot shows the symmetry of the central peak , and its similarity to the airy function over a considerable radius . in units of @xmath66 ,",
    "the tir pattern departs from the airy pattern by 1% of full scale at a radius of 0.30 , by 5% at 0.470.48 , and by 10% at 0.590.61 , where ranges refer to the two different profiles .",
    "the functional form away from the central peak is particularly relevant for satellite and lunar ranging applications , where the tangential velocity of the target results in a shift ( velocity aberration ) of the diffraction pattern at the position of the transmitter , so that a co - located receiver samples the shoulder of the diffraction pattern rather than its peak .",
    "lunar ranging to the 38  mm diameter ccrs at 532  nm imposes a velocity aberration of 46  @xmath71rad , which corresponds to about 0.290.43  @xmath66 .",
    "the airy function is therefore still accurate to within 5% in this regime , for normal incidence .",
    "as we move away from normal incidence , we may consider the effect of azimuth and inclination angle on the patterns .",
    "we present results in a @xmath72 grid corresponding to off - axis positions on a @xmath73 pitch and in a pythagorean arrangement .",
    "we place the normal incidence case at the upper left , so that the fourth panel over in the top row corresponds to an inclination angle of @xmath43 and an azimuth of @xmath74 , as defined in section  [ sec : geometry ] .",
    "this corresponds to the distant observer placed in the positive-@xmath6 direction in the global coordinate frame of figure  [ fig : ccr - geom ] , with @xmath75 .",
    "the second panel over in the bottom row has an inclination angle of @xmath76 and an azimuth of @xmath77 , putting the observer at a positive-@xmath6 coordinate , with @xmath78 .",
    "figure  [ fig : aperture - grid ] shows the appearance of the effective apertures as seen by the observer in these positions .    for horizontal polarization input  which we define as perpendicular to the plane of incidence ",
    "we get the patterns seen in figure  [ fig : ffdp - horz - grid ] . for vertical input polarization ,",
    "the patterns look the same , but with a @xmath79 rotation of all frames and the middle panel corresponding to vertical polarization output and the rightmost panel corresponding to horizontal output .",
    "the far - field diffraction patterns for left - handed circular input polarization are shown in figure  [ fig : ffdp - cw - grid ] .",
    "the patterns for right - handed circular polarization are the same except for a @xmath79 rotation of each frame and an exchange of horizontal and vertical polarizations .",
    "the normal - incidence pattern has a three - fold symmetry lacking in the linear polarization case , which stems from the complete orientation - invariance of circular polarization , so that only the corner cube asymmetries may imprint on the diffraction pattern .",
    "evidence for symmetry is also clear in the polarization patterns of figure  [ fig : circ - pol - out ] .",
    "we formed a linearly - polarized plane wave from a hene laser across a 25  mm diameter , having a wavefront quality of approximately @xmath804 as judged visually by a shear plate . to achieve a uniform spatial intensity across the aperture",
    ", we placed a @xmath81  mm circular aperture in front of the ccr , concentric with and close to the front face ( wavefront quality was better over the smaller aperture ) .",
    "the ccr used was a 25.4  mm diameter high - precision fused silica corner cube .",
    "we also tested a flight spare ccr from the apollo retroreflector arrays , finding similar results ",
    "albeit with increased scattered light and diffraction spikes owing to the intentionally ",
    "ground edges where the rear ccr surfaces meet occupying a significant fraction of the 9  mm aperture .",
    "the beam passed through an uncoated fused silica wedge window having @xmath82 surface quality before striking the ccr at normal incidence .",
    "the wedge window was tilted to reflect the returning beam away from the optical axis by an angle of approximately @xmath39 for access to imaging .",
    "a 339  mm focal length lens produced a far - field pattern onto a ccd camera with 3.65  @xmath71 m pixels .",
    "this results in 15.75 pixels spanning the @xmath83 airy diameter . replacing the corner cube with a flat mirror produced an airy pattern having azimuthally uniform rings and approximately 84% of the total flux within the first dark ring , as expected .",
    "the same measure performed on the tir pattern under horizontal polarization produced @xmath84% , in perfect agreement with the theoretical expectation .",
    "the experimental diffraction pattern images in figure  [ fig : experimental - diffrac ] have been rotated and reflected to place the experimental results in the same frame established for the simulated patterns ( i.e. , transformations followed the physical setup , and are not simply forced to match simulations ) .",
    "the polarization states and resulting diffraction patterns from tir ccrs are non - trivial and generally require computational tools to assess .",
    "this paper presents a comprehensive methodology for doing so , and provides results against which independent analyses may be compared .",
    "the results compare well against some  but not all  items available in the literature , and laboratory measurements confirm the validity of the mathematical development .",
    "the python code that generated all simulation results contained in this paper is available at http://physics.ucsd.edu/~tmurphy/papers/ccr-sim/ccr-sim.html .",
    "this tool can provide a springboard from which one might analyze aberrations from manufacturing imperfections , intentional offset angles of the rear surfaces , thermally - induced refractive index gradients , aperture masking or blockage , non - planar wavefront input , etc . in a companion paper @xcite",
    ", we explore the impact of thermal gradients on the diffraction patterns from tir corner cube prisms .",
    "we thank jim faller for loaning to us the apollo flight spare corner cube .",
    "we are also grateful to ray williamson for helping us sort out confusing mis - information on wave plate orientations and tests to determine their optical axes .",
