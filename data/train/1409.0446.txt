    "we establish a connection between this problem and another difficult problem : the seemingly `` almost random '' behaviour of digits in the base 3 representations of the numbers @xmath5 .",

    "we prove that almost all values of the logarithmic complexity @xmath12 are located in the segment @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "having computed @xmath10 up to @xmath15 , we present some of our observations .    in section [ palgo ]",
    "we explore the so - called @xmath6-algorithms - a family of `` deterministic '' algorithms for building representations of numbers in basis @xmath7 .",
    "`` deterministic '' means that these algorithms do not use searching over trees , but are building expressions directly from the numbers to be represented .",
    "let @xmath6 be a non - empty finite set of primes , for example , @xmath16 , or @xmath17 .",
    "@xmath6-algorithm is building an expression of a number @xmath18 in basis @xmath7 by subtracting 1 s and by dividing ( whenever possible ) by primes from the set @xmath6 .",
    "we explore the spectrum of the logarithmic complexity @xmath19 .",
    "throughout this subsection , we assume that @xmath20 are positive integers such that @xmath21 is irrational , i.e. , @xmath22 for any integers @xmath23 .    let us denote by @xmath24 the * @xmath25-th digit * in the canonical base @xmath26 representation of the number @xmath1 , and by @xmath27 - the * sum of digits * in this representation .",
    "let us consider base @xmath26 representations of powers @xmath28 .",
    "imagine , for a moment ( somewhat incorrectly ) , that , for fixed @xmath29 , the digits @xmath30 behave like as statistically independent random variables taking the values @xmath31 with equal probabilities @xmath32 .",
    "then , the ( pseudo ) mean value and ( peudo ) variance of @xmath30 would be @xmath33 the total number of digits in the base @xmath26 representation of @xmath28 is @xmath34 , hence , the ( pseudo ) mean value of the sum @xmath35 would be @xmath36 and , because of the assumed ( pseudo ) independence of digits , its ( pseudo ) variance would be @xmath37 . as the final consequence , the corresponding centered and normed variable @xmath38 would behave as a standard normally distributed random variable with probability density @xmath39 .",
    "one can try verifying this conclusion experimentally .",
    "for example , let us compute @xmath40 for @xmath1 up to @xmath41 , and let us draw the histogram of the corresponding centered and normed variable @xmath42 ( see fig .",
    "[ histo1 ] ) .",
    "as we see , this variable behaves , indeed , almost exactly , as a standard normally distributed random variable ( the solid curve ) .",

    "let us try to estimate the amplitude of the possible deviations by `` applying '' the law of the iterated logarithm .",
    "let us introduce centered and normed ( pseudo ) random variables : @xmath45 by summing up these variables for @xmath25 from @xmath46 to @xmath47 , we obtain a sequence of ( pseudo ) random variables : @xmath48 that  must obey `` the law of the iterated logarithm .",
    "namely , if the sequence @xmath43 behaves , indeed , as a ' ' typical \" sum of equally distributed random variables , then @xmath49 and @xmath50 of the fraction @xmath51 ( @xmath52 stands for the natural logarithm ) must be @xmath53 and @xmath54 correspondingly .",
    "therefore , it seems , we could conjecture that , if we denote @xmath55 then @xmath56 .",
    "in particular , this would mean that @xmath57 by setting @xmath58 ( note that @xmath59 ) : @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 .    , scaledwidth=80.0% ]    however , the behaviour of the expression @xmath63 until @xmath64 does not show convergence to the segment @xmath65 $ ] ( see fig .",

    "it follows from his theorem 2 ( put @xmath66 ) , that @xmath67 where the constant @xmath68 can be effectively computed from @xmath69 .",
    "since then , no better than @xmath70 lower bounds of @xmath43 have been proved .",
    "however , it appears that from a well - known unproved hypothesis about integer complexity in basis @xmath7 , one can derive a strong * linear * lower bound of @xmath40 .",
