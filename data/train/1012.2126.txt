    "in the gev energy domain , there are competing pictures for how meson photoproduction reactions can be most economically described . in the meson - baryon picture , pseudo - scalar meson photoproduction proceeds by @xmath12 and @xmath13channel baryon exchange , plus @xmath14channel meson exchange . at @xmath15 gev@xmath6 and high @xmath16 ,",
    "cross sections are frequently well described in an approach with the exchange of one or more regge trajectories , corresponding to , in this reaction , @xmath17 and @xmath18 trajectories  @xcite . for a single trajectory ,",
    "the cross section @xmath19 can be parametrized @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a scale factor taken to be 1 gev and @xmath22 is a function of @xmath1 alone .",
    "@xmath23 is the regge trajectory that describes how the angular momentum of the exchange varies with @xmath1 .",
    "note that in a reaction where @xmath24 , one would expect the cross section to `` scale '' with @xmath25 .",
    "that is , the @xmath26-scaled cross section would exhibit a uniform smooth dependence on @xmath3 that depends neither on @xmath5 nor separately on the production angle of the meson .",
    "exclusive scattering in the high momentum and energy transfer limit is thought to follow the constituent counting rules introduced in refs .  @xcite .",
    "while the existence of these rules can be proved rigorously within perturbative qcd ( pqcd )  @xcite , they can also be derived based on more general grounds of the constituent nature of scattering without requiring the validity of pqcd  @xcite . in both interpretations",
    ", however , the onset of constituent counting manifests the transition from peripheral regge type scattering to short range hard scattering involving a minimal number of partonic constituents , plus leptonic or photon fields , via which a given exclusive reaction can occur .",
    "the constituent counting rule predicts the analytical form for the differential cross section @xmath19 to be @xmath27 in the limit that @xmath28 and @xmath29 is fixed , where the @xmath30 s are the masses of the particles involved in the reaction .",
    "the power factor @xmath31 is the minimal number of point - like constituents needed to accomplish the reaction .",
    "for photoproduction of pseudoscalar mesons , the relevant @xmath31 is 9 if the photon is counted as a single elementary field , so the expectation is that the cross section should scale as @xmath4 .",
    "the requirement that @xmath29 remain fixed at given high @xmath5 amounts to the meson production angle , @xmath32 , being held fixed .",
    "the form of the function @xmath33 is not specified , but can be in principle calculated either within pqcd or in non - perturbative models of constituent quark scattering . the major problem with pqcd , however , is in significant underestimation of the absolute magnitude of the function @xmath33 ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",

    "@xcite ) . in such models , however , the power law of the energy dependence is rather an accidental result .",
    "this situation can not explain the `` persistent '' consistency of the constituent scaling law observed for many hard exclusive reactions including hadronic  @xcite and photoproduction  @xcite reactions , involving proton , deuteron and even @xmath34 targets at @xmath35 kinematics ( see _ e.g. _ refs .",

    "so - called hadrodynamic models based on effective lagrangians have , for many years , been employed with moderate success to describe a wide range of hadronic and electromagnetic reactions , including the particular reaction that is the focus of this paper  @xcite .",
    "looking for such resonances in strangeness - containing final states has been a hunting ground for so - called `` missing '' resonances predicted in quark models  @xcite but not seen in pionic final state experiments .",
    "separating out the resonant contributions to the overall reaction mechanism has been pursued in various model approaches . in recent times",
    ", the most advanced methods include unitary coupled - channels methods that fit data sets from multiple channels simultaneously .",

    "a problem with this and similar hadrodynamic approaches lies in the broad freedom in the overlap of several contributing @xmath8 resonances and insufficient experimental constraints from spin observables to uniquely describe the reactions . as an alternative to the @xmath8 resonance picture involving 3-quark resonances",

    "this allows us to revisit the question of scaling and resonances outlined above .",
    "the paper is organized first with more theoretical background about scaling in section  [ sec : partonic ] , and then the experimental results demonstrating scaling behavior are shown in section  [ sec : scaling ] .",

    "the onset of the energy scaling of the differential cross section of the @xmath49 photoproduction reaction in the form of @xmath50 at fixed @xmath32 indicates in a certain degree the factorization of the hard sub - processes in the scattering amplitude which can be expressed in the form ( see _ e.g. _ refs .",

    "the latter can result to the additional oscillatory energy dependence of the @xmath63 scaled differential cross sections ( see _ e.g. _ refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    while the number of the partonic constituents in the wave function of hadrons in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ampl ] ) can be identified with that of the valence quarks , the interpretation of the physical photon at pre - asymptotic energies requires the consideration of both bare and hadronic components of its wave function .",
    "it is rather well established that the physical photon s wave function can be represented through the superposition of a bare photon and hadronic components ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath64 where the hadronic part is dominated by intermediate vector mesons states . due to the large interaction cross section the hadronic part of the photon wave function dominates in many photoproduction processes especially involving the production of vector mesons .    in the high energy and momentum transfer limit one",
    "expects that the bare photon component will gradually dominate in the photoproduction cross section since the hard kernel , @xmath56 , involving the hadronic component of the photon is suppressed by an additional factor , @xmath65 , as compared to the amplitude involving the bare photon only .",
    "however for the intermediate range of energies the hadronic component may still dominate in the hard processes at @xmath66 due to the relatively large coupling constant of the physical photon to the vector mesons . in this case",
    "the hard rescattering ( see _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite ) of intermediate vector mesons off the target nucleon defines the energy dependence of the photodisintegration cross section .",
    "this situation can explain the observed @xmath67 scaling of hard real compton scattering at large @xmath32  @xcite as well as exclusive photoproduction of @xmath68 mesons  @xcite which agrees reasonably well with the @xmath67 scaling of the differential cross section .",
    "the situation however is simplified with consideration of the photoproduction of pseudoscalar mesons . in this case the contribution from @xmath69 is suppressed since the dominating @xmath70 rescattering will proceed through the double helicity flip scattering which one expects to be suppressed in the high momentum transfer limit .",
    "this expectation is confirmed in the exclusive photoproduction of @xmath71-mesons in @xmath72 reactions which clearly shows a @xmath4 scaling starting already at @xmath73  gev@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "similar ( early ) scaling , may be expected for kaon photoproduction in @xmath74 or @xmath75 reactions .",
    "the precision of the previous data  @xcite on exclusive kaon photoproduction was not sufficient ( @xmath50 , @xmath76 ) to rule out unambiguously the contribution from the hadronic component of the photon wave function , which results in @xmath77 .",

    "the data are binned in bands of center of mass angle @xmath82 , each of width 0.1 .",
    "representative error bars are shown only for several angles important for this discussion ; the close spacing of the data points makes it easy to trace the trends as a function of angle .",
    "the important observation here is that for forward angles ( green points ) the cross sections fall smoothly with increasing @xmath3 , and that there is some hint of `` structure '' for intermediate angles near @xmath83 gev@xmath6 .",
    "figure  [ fig : dsdts2 ] shows the same data with a scaling factor of @xmath26 applied .",
    "it is evident that the forward - angle data now fall on a fairly tight locus of points , while for @xmath84 gev@xmath6 this simple scaling fails .",

    "no previous work has made a claim for a @xmath178-wave structure near 2.1 gev in this reaction channel ; previously , data were too sparse to clearly examine the angular dependence in this mass range . from fig .",
    "[ fig : dsdtshape ] one sees that this state influences the reaction also below 2 gev .",
    "hence , earlier work that concentrated on @xmath7 below 2 gev may need revision .",
    "we also note that the `` 2 star ''  @xcite resonance @xmath194 was identified by capstick and roberts  @xcite in their relativized quark model as having large combined strength in both photo - coupling and decay to @xmath195 .",
    "this led mart and bennhold  @xcite to tentatively identify this state with the large structure at 1.9 gev .",
    "our study supports the existence of a @xmath11 state coupling to @xmath40 , not at 1.9 gev but rather at 2.1 gev .",
    "in this paper we have ignored the available spin observables for this reaction , including the recoil polarization of the @xmath196 hyperon , @xmath197  @xcite , the beam asymmetry @xmath198  @xcite , the beam - recoil double polarizations @xmath199 and @xmath200  @xcite , and the beam - recoil linear double polarizations @xmath201 and @xmath202  @xcite . including these in amplitude - level fits results in much more sensitivity to smaller contributions to the reaction mechanism .",
    "further , we have ignored the effects of unitarity bounds and channel coupling .",
    "thus , the main result of this work has been to demonstrate how two different types of scaling apply to this reaction , and to demonstrate how the @xmath105-scaled cross section highlights some of the important resonance contributions to the reaction mechanism .",
    "this phenomenological analysis of the @xmath185 reaction has thus yielded some insights into this reaction . however , a theoretical foundation for using the notions of @xmath4 scaling and baryon resonance analysis in the same framework is lacking . with the observations made here , we hope to stimulate further efforts to understand whether this approach can be put on a more rigorous footing . we expect to study other meson photoproduction reactions to test the consistency of this approach",
