    "let @xmath0 be the set of all planar closed convex sets and denote by @xmath1 the standard integer lattice in @xmath2 .",

    "the perimeter , diameter , circumradius , inradius , minimal width and the area of a convex body @xmath3 are denoted by @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the study of optimal relations between two of these functionals ( for convex sets of arbitrary dimension ) is a classical problem in convex geometry ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the planar case , there is an extensive bibliography if one adds the extra assumption that @xmath5 is lattice - free ( cf .",
    "for this situation , hillock & scott  @xcite collected the known best possible inequalities relating pairs of the six functionals above .",
    "the only pairs that are missing in their list are @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "they have not been addressed so far and are the subject of our interest .",
    "the fact that lattice - freeness is not preserved by arbitrary scaling is usually reflected in the non - homogeneity of the geometric inequalities that are derived . in this spirit",
    ", we propose the study of sharp upper bounds for the non - negative functionals @xmath14 and @xmath15 , for lattice - free  @xmath3 .",
    "the existence of such upper bounds is proven by @xmath16 which follows from @xmath17 ( see  @xcite ) together with @xmath18 ( see  @xcite ) , @xmath19 .",
    "we conjecture , however , that the following bounds are the best possible @xmath20 the equilateral triangle of edge lengths @xmath21 for the pair @xmath12 and the split @xmath22 for the pair @xmath13 attain equality .    in the following ,",
    "we prove our conjectured inequalities in various cases , and offer sharp bounds on some non - linear functionals related to these magnitudes .",
    "a general proof for   has to be left as an open problem .    for our first result , we need to recall the notion of an _ unconditional _ set : some @xmath3 that is symmetric with respect to the lines @xmath23 and @xmath24 , for a suitable @xmath25 .",
    "[ th : prc ] let @xmath3 be lattice - free and unconditional",
    ". then @xmath26 the inequality is best possible",
    ".    often one can apply appropriate steiner symmetrizations to a general lattice - free  @xmath5 to obtain a lattice - free unconditional set ( cf .  @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , this method usually decreases the functional @xmath15 and hence is not applicable in our situation .",
    "our second result shows the validity of the first conjectured inequality in   for triangles .",
    "[ th : pdc ] let @xmath27 be a lattice - free triangle",
    ". then @xmath28 in particular , @xmath29 , and equality holds in   if and only if @xmath30 is an equilateral triangle with edge lengths @xmath21 .",
    "note that the refined inequality   is specific to triangles and does not hold for general lattice - free convex sets .    complementing the partial results above , we found the following sharp , yet weaker inequalities relating the magnitudes of interest .",

    "observe that our conjectured bound for the pair @xmath12 in   is independent from inequality i ) above , whereas the conjectured bound for @xmath13 would strengthen inequality ii ) by @xmath33 .",
    "first of all , since @xmath5 is unconditional we have @xmath34 and it suffices to show the inequality @xmath35 .",
    "let @xmath25 be the center of symmetry of @xmath5 .",
    "note , that @xmath36 lies in the interior of @xmath5 and is at the same time its circumcenter .",
    "as  @xmath1 is symmetric with respect to the coordinate axes , we may assume that after suitable reflections and translations of @xmath5 its center @xmath36 is contained in @xmath37 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "since @xmath38 , there exists a supporting line @xmath39 of @xmath5 with @xmath40 .",
    "we first suppose that @xmath41 ^ 2\\neq\\{0\\}$ ] . since @xmath42 ^ 2 $ ] , it holds @xmath43 , where @xmath44 denotes the euclidean norm . due to the unconditionality of  @xmath5 ,",
    "the symmetric line @xmath45 to @xmath39 with respect to @xmath36 supports  @xmath5 as well .",
    "therefore , @xmath5 is contained in the strip determined by @xmath39 and @xmath45 which has width at most  @xmath46 , hence @xmath47 .",
    "using an inequality of henk & tsintsifas  @xcite , we get @xmath48 , as desired .",
    "we now consider the case @xmath41",
    "^ 2=\\{0\\}$ ] .",
    "we shoot a ray from @xmath36 in direction @xmath49 and we let @xmath50 be the intersection point of this ray and @xmath39 .",
    "since @xmath39 has negative slope , @xmath51 if @xmath52 , and @xmath53 if @xmath54 . in both cases",
    ", it follows that @xmath55 .",
    "let @xmath56 .",
    "the functionals @xmath57 and @xmath58 are homogeneous of degree @xmath46 , and so @xmath59 we observe that @xmath60 is unconditional with respect to @xmath61 , and the line @xmath62 supports @xmath60 .",
    "moreover , the unconditionality of @xmath60 implies that the lines @xmath63 , and @xmath64 symmetric to @xmath39 , with respect to @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , respectively , support @xmath60 .",
    "thus @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the rhombus determined by these four lines and therefore @xmath60 is lattice - free . by definition of the circumradius , we have @xmath70 ^ 2=q'$ ] .",
    "thus @xmath71 and hence @xmath72 .    in the last step ,",
    "we show @xmath73\\times[-1/2,1/2]\\right)\\label{eq : uncond_1}\\\\ & = 4\\cir(k')+2,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which implies the desired inequality ( see figure  [ fig : uncond ] ) . to this end , we remark that the four vertices of @xmath69 can not all lie in @xmath74 , as this would mean that @xmath75 , a contradiction .",
    "thus , we assume without loss of generality that the two vertices of @xmath69 that are contained in the line @xmath67 lie outside of @xmath74 .",
    "let @xmath76 be the intersection point of @xmath39 and the boundary of @xmath77 with @xmath78 , and let @xmath79 be the intersection point of @xmath39 with the boundary of @xmath37\\times[-\\cir(k')+1/2,0]$ ] with @xmath80 .",
    "moreover , we define the following distances of segments in @xmath69 and @xmath77 ( see figure  [ fig : uncond ] ) : @xmath81      by the symmetry of @xmath82 , it is enough to prove @xmath83 in order to get  . using basic properties of homothetic triangles and pythagoras theorem",
    ", we obtain @xmath84 writing @xmath85 and @xmath86 , the inequality @xmath83 becomes @xmath87 since @xmath88 , this is equivalent to @xmath89 taking squares on both sides gives @xmath90 which follows from @xmath91 .",
    "therefore , inequality   holds and we have @xmath92 .",
    "we start by determining the scaling factor @xmath94 for which @xmath95 is such that the length of the segment @xmath96 is equal to  @xmath46 , where @xmath39 is the line that is parallel and at distance @xmath46 to the longest edge @xmath97 of  @xmath98 and on the same side of @xmath97 as the vertex of @xmath98 that is not contained in  @xmath97 ( see figure  [ fig : triangle ] ) .      since the diameter of @xmath98 is attained by its longest edge , we get from thales theorem that @xmath99 and thus @xmath100 .",
    "scott  @xcite showed that for lattice - free @xmath30 it holds @xmath101 .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath102 and hence @xmath103 .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath104 and we can restrict our attention to the triangle @xmath98 .",
    "now , we rotate and translate @xmath98 appropriately such that its longest edge lies on the @xmath105-axis and the chord @xmath96 has endpoints @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "let us further denote the vertices of the longest edge by @xmath108 and @xmath109 , for @xmath110 , and we may assume that @xmath111 ( see  figure  [ fig : triangle ] ) .",
    "a straightforward computation shows that @xmath112 is the third vertex of @xmath98 , and moreover @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the vertices @xmath112 and @xmath109 determine an edge of length at most @xmath115 , and thus @xmath116 taking squares and dividing by @xmath117 we obtain @xmath118 , and hence @xmath119 . together with @xmath111 , this gives @xmath120 .",
    "as @xmath121 equals the sum of the short edges minus @xmath115 , we get @xmath122 since @xmath123 is non - increasing and @xmath119 , we get an upper bound on @xmath121 by substituting @xmath124 by @xmath125 as follows @xmath126 now , we define @xmath127 and we compute that @xmath128 therefore , @xmath129 is non - increasing as well , and by @xmath130 , we have @xmath131 . using the formula for the scaling factor @xmath132 , we arrive at @xmath133 it is easy to see that @xmath134 and hence @xmath29 .    tracing back the inequalities , we see that equality holds in   if and only if @xmath135 and @xmath136 .",
    "this means that @xmath30 is similar to the triangle with vertices @xmath137 , and @xmath138 .",
    "this triangle is equilateral with edge lengths @xmath21 .",
