    "chiral amphiphilic molecules can self - assemble into microstructures with a variety of morphologies .",
    "two of the most interesting morphologies , both for basic research and for technological applications , are cylindrical tubules and helical ribbons  @xcite .",
    "tubules are bilayer or multilayer membranes of amphiphilic molecules wrapped in a cylinder , as shown in fig .",
    "[ tubulephoto ]  @xcite .",
    "they are observed in a variety of systems , including diacetylenic lipids  @xcite , bile  @xcite , surfactants  @xcite , and glutamates  @xcite . in diacetylenic lipid systems ,",
    "the tubule diameter is typically 0.5  @xmath0 m and the tubule length is typically 50200  @xmath0 m ; in other systems , the tubule dimensions are typically several times larger  @xcite . in most of these systems ,",
    "tubules exhibit a helical `` barber - pole '' pattern on the surface of the cylinder .",
    "helical ribbons are similar microstructures , consisting of long twisted strips of membranes with their edges exposed to the solvent , as shown in fig .",
    "[ helixphoto ]  @xcite . in some cases , helical ribbons are unstable precursors to the formation of tubules ; in other cases , helical ribbons appear to be stable .",
    "cylindrical tubules have been studied extensively for use in several technological applications , such as electroactive composites and controlled - release systems  @xcite .",
    "helical ribbons have not been used in technological applications , but they have also been studied extensively as part of an effort to rationally control the self - assembly of tubules .",
    "there have been three general approaches to the theory of tubules and helical ribbons .",
    "first , de gennes argued that a membrane of chiral molecules in any tilted phase must develop a spontaneous electrostatic polarization  @xcite .",
    "this polarization can induce a narrow strip of membrane to buckle into a cylinder .",
    "the original theory of de gennes described buckling along the long axis of a cylinder , but a straightforward modification describes helical winding due to electrostatic interactions .",
    "this theoretical approach predicts that adding of electrolytes to the solvent should increase the radius of the resulting tubules , because the electrostatic interaction would be screened by electrolytes in solution .",
    "however , experiments have shown that electrolytes in solution do not affect the formation or radius of tubules  @xcite , except for the particular case of tubules composed of amphiphiles with charged head groups  @xcite .",
    "thus , electrostatic interaction is very probably not a dominant factor in tubule formation .    as",
    "an alternative theoretical approach , lubensky and prost derived a general phase diagram for membranes with in - plane orientational order , which predicts cylinders as well as spheres , flat disks , and tori  @xcite . within the cylindrical phase ,",
    "the cylinder radius and length are determined by a competition between the curvature energy and the edge energy .",
    "one important prediction of this theory is the scaling @xmath1 between the tubule radius @xmath2 and the tubule length @xmath3 .",
    "however , experiments have found no correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "rather , in a typical sample of tubules , @xmath2 is quite monodisperse while @xmath3 varies widely  @xcite .",
    "thus , the competition between curvature energy and edge energy is also not a dominant factor in tubule formation .",
    "a third approach , which is consistent with the experimental results on lipid tubules , is based on the chiral packing of the molecules in a membrane .",
    "helfrich and prost have shown that a chiral membrane in a tilted phase will form a cylinder because of an intrinsic bending force due to chirality  @xcite .",
    "this bending force arises because long chiral molecules do not pack parallel to their neighbors , but rather at a nonzero twist angle with respect to their neighbors .",
    "if the molecules lie in bilayers , and are tilted with respect to the local layer normal , the favored twist from neighbor to neighbor leads the whole membrane to twist into a cylinder .",
    "several investigators have generalized the original helfrich - prost concept of an intrinsic chiral bending force in different ways .",
    "ou - yang and liu have developed a version of this theory based on an analogy with cholesteric liquid crystals  @xcite .",
    "chappell and yager have developed an analogous theory in which the direction of one - dimensional chains of molecules , rather than the direction of molecular tilt , defines a vector order parameter within the membrane  @xcite .",
    "nelson and powers have used the renormalization group to calculate the effects of thermal fluctuations on tubules  @xcite .",
    "this calculation predicts an anomalous scaling of the tubule radius as a function of the strength of the chiral interaction .",
    "_ have considered the full elastic anisotropy of a membrane , and have related the pitch angle of tubules to a ratio of membrane elastic constants  @xcite .",
    "they have also made predictions for the kinetic evolution of helical ribbons into tubules .    in our earlier paper",
    ", we generalized the helfrich - prost concept in another way  @xcite .",
    "in that theory , we began with a three - dimensional ( 3d ) liquid - crystal free energy and applied it to the case of chiral molecules in a membrane .",
    "we showed that the chiral term in this free energy has two simultaneous effects : it leads the membrane to twist into a cylinder , and it induces a variation in the direction of the molecular tilt on the cylinder . through this calculation",
    ", we predicted that tubules can form periodic modulated structures characterized by helical stripes in the tilt direction winding around the cylinders , as shown in fig .",
    "[ tiltmodulation ] .",
    "these stripes are analogous to the stripes seen in thin films of chiral smectic liquid crystals  @xcite , but in a cylindrical rather than a planar geometry .",
    "we argued that these stripes correspond to the helical substructure that is often observed on tubules .    in this paper",
    ", we further extend this theoretical approach to provide a more unified and systematic model of tubules and helical ribbons .",
    "first , we combine our earlier theory with the chung theory to obtain a theory of tubules with both elastic anisotropy and tilt modulation .",
    "we derive explicit expressions for the average direction of the tilt and for the direction of the modulation , in terms of the elastic coefficients , and we show that these directions are different .",
    "next , we show that the same theory can also be applied to helical ribbons .",
    "this theory shows that helical ribbons can be stable microstructures for a certain range of parameters ; they are not necessarily intermediate states in the formation of tubules . finally , we investigate the effects of the striped tilt modulation on the detailed shape of tubules .",
    "based on recent models of lipid bilayers  @xcite , we expect a modulation in the tilt to induce a modulation in the curvature .",
    "we predict the curvature modulation illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ripple3d ] , which resembles the @xmath4 rippled phases of lyotropic liquid crystals  @xcite .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we construct a free energy for tubules and helical ribbons , which includes elastic anisotropy and includes the possibility of tilt modulation . in sec .",
    "iii , we use this free energy to predict the radius and tilt direction for tubules with uniform tilt .",
    "the results of that section are in exact agreement with the theory of chung _ et al . _ in sec .",
    "iv , we consider tubules with a modulation in the tilt .",
    "we propose an explicit ansatz for that modulation , and then minimize the free energy over the parameters in that ansatz .",
    "we find that there is a first - order transition from uniform to modulated tubules . in sec .",
    "v , we apply the same theory to helical ribbons . the theory predicts the range of parameters in which helical ribbons are stable . in sec .",
    "vi , we investigate ripples in the curvature of tubules and helical ribbons .",
    "we derive an explicit expression for the ripple shape that corresponds to our ansatz for the tilt modulation . finally , in sec .",
    "vii , we discuss these theoretical predictions and compare them with experimental results .",
    "in this section , we construct a free energy for tubules and helical ribbons . in this free energy",
    ", we suppose that the membrane is in a fluid phase , which may have hexatic bond - orientational order but does not have crystalline positional order .",
    "this assumption is based on the theoretical argument of nelson and peliti , who showed that a flexible membrane can not have crystalline positional order in thermal equilibrium at nonzero temperature , because thermal fluctuations induce dislocations , which destroy this order on long length scales  @xcite .",
    "this assumption is also supported by two types of experimental evidence .",
    "first , treanor and pace found a distinct fluid character in nuclear magnetic resonance and electron spin resonance experiments on tubules  @xcite .",
    "second , brandow _ et al .",
    "_ found that tubule membranes can flow to seal up cuts in the membrane from an atomic force microscope tip  @xcite .",
    "this flow indicates that the membrane has no shear modulus  @xcite .",
    "further information on the membrane phase comes from thomas _ et al .",
    ", _ who found long positional correlation lengths of 0.068 to 0.135  @xmath5 m in synchrotron x - ray scattering studies of tubules  @xcite",
    ". taken together , all of these experimental results suggest that tubule membranes are in a highly correlated hexatic phase .    in this paper",
    ", we do not attempt to derive the free energy from a 3d liquid - crystal free energy , as in our earlier paper  @xcite .",
    "rather , we use a 2d differential - geometry notation , which is more general . in this notation ,",
    "the curvature of a membrane is described by the curvature tensor @xmath6 .",
    "the orientation of the molecular tilt is represented by the unit vector @xmath7 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ phidef ] , @xmath7 is the projection of the molecular director @xmath8 into the local tangent plane , normalized to unit magnitude .",
    "a membrane may consist of a single domain , in which the curvature @xmath6 is low and the tilt direction @xmath7 varies smoothly .",
    "alternatively , a membrane may consist of many internal domains separated by domain walls .",
    "domain walls are sharp boundaries between domains . across a narrow domain wall",
    ", @xmath7 jumps abruptly and @xmath6 may become high . here",
    ", we will consider the free energy of domains and domain walls separately .",
    "first , we consider a domain of low curvature and smoothly varying tilt . within a domain of a membrane",
    ", the free energy can be written as @xmath9\\biggr ] .",

    ", we shall imply summation over repeated indices , such as @xmath13 in the first term above .",
    "the first term of @xmath14 is the standard helfrich bending energy of the membrane  @xcite .",
    "the coefficient @xmath15 is the isotropic rigidity .",
    "the second term represents the anisotropy of the rigidity .",
    "the coefficient @xmath16 is the difference between the energy required to bend the membrane parallel to the tilt @xmath7 and the energy required to bend it perpendicular to @xmath7 . in general",
    ", @xmath17 can be either positive or negative .",
    "the third term , introduced by helfrich and prost  @xcite , is a chiral term that favors curvature in a direction @xmath18 from @xmath7 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath19 is a measure of the magnitude of the chiral interaction between the molecules in the membrane .",
    "the fourth term is another chiral term , which favors a bend in @xmath7 .",
    "this term was introduced by langer and sethna in the context of flat films of chiral liquid crystals  @xcite .",
    "the coefficient @xmath20 should have the same magnitude as @xmath19 ; both coefficients are comparable to @xmath21 in the notation of our earlier paper  @xcite . however , there is no symmetry reason why @xmath20 and @xmath19 must be equal .",
    "the fifth term , with coefficient @xmath22 , is the coupling between curvature of the membrane and splay of @xmath7 .",
    "it can be understood in two equivalent ways : ( a )  the curvature of the membrane breaks the symmetry between the two monolayers of a bilayer and hence induces a splay in @xmath7 , or ( b )  a splay in @xmath7 induces a curvature of the membrane to keep the molecules more nearly parallel in three dimensions .",
    "this term is equivalent to terms that have been considered in the lubensky - mackintosh theory of @xmath4 rippled phases  @xcite .",
    "the final pair of terms is the 2d frank free energy for variations in @xmath7 .",
    "it provides an energy penalty for tilt variations , and hence limits those variations .",
    "the coefficient @xmath23 is a single frank constant .",
    "we now consider a domain wall between two domains . across a domain wall , the tilt direction @xmath7 changes abruptly .",
    "the curvature @xmath6 may also become large , giving a `` crease '' in the membrane .",
    "for those reasons , different parts of the molecules come into contact at a domain walls than inside the domains .",
    "a domain wall therefore costs an energy @xmath24 per unit length .",
    "the domain - wall energy can not be derived from the free energy  ( [ freegeneral ] ) within a domain ; rather , it is an additional parameter that describes narrow walls where that free energy does not apply . for any morphology that includes domain walls , with a total wall length @xmath25 , the total free energy is @xmath26 .    in the free energy  ( [ freegeneral ] ) , the term @xmath27 is a total derivative .",
    "if the curvature is constant , as in a perfect cylinder , the term @xmath28 is also a total derivative .",
    "one might think that these terms integrate to constants and hence do not affect the morphology of a membrane .",
    "however , these terms are significant if the membrane consists of internal domains separated by domain walls , because they then become line integrals along the domain walls . indeed",
    ", these terms favor the formation of a series of domains separated by domain walls , because they can contribute a negative free energy for each domain .",
    "thus , in the rest of this paper , we will retain these terms , and we will explicitly compare their negative contribution to the free energy with the energy cost of the domain walls .",
    "the free energy  ( [ freegeneral ] ) does not contain an exhaustive list of all the terms permitted by symmetry ; other terms are also possible . for example , the term @xmath29 would give an additional elastic anisotropy , which has been considered by chung _",
    "et al . _",
    "the combination @xmath30 would give a difference in the frank constants for bend and splay .",
    "rather , this free energy is only intended to include the terms that generate distinct physical effects , while the omitted terms give higher - order details of the structure .    if the membrane forms a perfect cylinder with radius @xmath2 , the free energy  ( [ freegeneral ] ) simplifies greatly . in the standard",

    "@xcite originally derived eq .",

    "the ratio of 3.4 is quite reasonable , but the ratio of 0.0015 is surprising .",

    "in this section , we relax the assumption that the tilt direction @xmath7 is uniform everywhere on a tubule . instead , we allow @xmath7 to vary as a function of the cylindrical coordinates @xmath59 and @xmath60 , with @xmath61 .",

    "we have shown that there is a first - order transition from a uniform state to a modulated state characterized by stripes in the tilt direction .",
    "we must now discuss corrections to two approximations in this variational calculation .",
    "first , we assumed that there is only a small variation in the tilt direction across a stripe : @xmath76 . in some systems , @xmath80 might be locked at a larger angle .",
    "for example , in a membrane with hexatic bond - orientational order , the angle @xmath147 would be favored , because that angle would allow the tilt direction to jump from one bond direction to another bond direction across each domain wall",
    ". such locking has been investigated in the context of flat liquid - crystal films by hinshaw _",
    "et al . _",
    "in such a system , the transition from the uniform state to the modulated state would become more strongly first - order than we calculated above : the larger discontinuity in @xmath80 would imply a larger latent heat of transition .",
    "thus , the quantitative predictions of this section would no longer apply .",
    "nevertheless , our qualitative predictions would still apply , because tubules would have a first - order transition from a uniform state to a modulated state whether or not @xmath76 .",
    "second , we did the variational calculation with the approximation that the stripe width @xmath96 is a continuous variable , or equivalently , that the number of stripes @xmath62 takes continuous rather than just integer values .",
    "in fact , because of the periodic boundary conditions going around a cylinder , the parameter @xmath62 must be an integer , and hence @xmath94 is restricted to a discrete set of values .",
    "for that reason , there will be a series of jumps , or first - order transitions , between different integer values of @xmath62 . within each constant-@xmath62 `` phase ,",
    "'' there will be one special point where the continuous minimization gives exactly the right answer : @xmath148  integer . at those special points , all the results of the minimization ( for @xmath97 , @xmath96 , @xmath80 , etc . )",
    "will be correct . between those special points , there will be deviations from the predictions of the continuous approximation .",
    "the actual values should therefore fluctuate _ about _ the values from the continuous approximation .",
    "thus , this approximation should give a reasonable estimate of the actual results .",
    "in this section , we apply the theory for the modulated state of tubules , developed in the previous section , to helical ribbons . we draw an explicit analogy between a single stripe of a modulated tubule and a single ribbon .",
    "we show that a helical ribbon can be either a stable state of a membrane or an unstable intermediate state in the formation of a tubule .",
    "a stable helical ribbon has a particular optimum width .",
    "if more molecules are added to the ribbon , it becomes longer , not wider .",
    "by contrast , an unstable helical ribbon grows wider until it forms a tubule .",
    "the basis of our calculation is the geometry shown in fig .",

    "again , we describe the tilt variation using the @xmath66 coordinate , @xmath149 which runs in the @xmath67 direction .",
    "the ribbon edges are at @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is a variational parameter .",
    "the maximum possible value is @xmath152 , at which point the edges of the ribbon collide , and the ribbon forms a tubule . between the edges ,",
    "our ansatz for the tilt direction @xmath63 is @xmath153 this ansatz is a single period of the sawtooth wave of fig .",

    "iv , the ansatz has five variational parameters : the radius @xmath2 , the average tilt direction @xmath73 , the amplitude of the tilt variation @xmath154 , the ribbon direction @xmath67 , and the angle @xmath151 , which is the half - width of the ribbon in the @xmath66 coordinate .",
    "the actual width of the ribbon is @xmath155    we must now express the free energy  ( [ free1 ] ) of a helical ribbon in terms of these five variational parameters .",
    "the free energy is expressed per unit area of membrane , where the area does not include the gaps between the edges of the ribbon . for most of the terms , the free energy per unit area of a tubule , derived in sec .",
    "iv , still applies .",
    "however , instead of the domain - wall energy @xmath86 , we must now use the edge energy @xmath156 per unit length for each of the two edges of the ribbon .",
    "this edge energy gives the energy cost of having different parts of the molecules exposed to the solvent at the ribbon edges .",
    "hence , the total free energy per unit area in our ansatz for a helical ribbon becomes @xmath157 this expression must be minimized over the five variational parameters @xmath2 , @xmath91 , @xmath80 , @xmath65 , and @xmath158 .    at this point",
    ", we note that all five variational parameters are continuous variables ; none of them is an integer , as in the previous section .",
    "thus , we can immediately change variables from @xmath158 to the ribbon width @xmath159 , and from @xmath65 to the difference angle @xmath160 . in terms of these variables ,",

    "( [ free3 ] ) for the tubule free energy , but with @xmath162 substituted in place of @xmath86 .",
    "however , for ribbons , all of the parameters really are continuous variables ; that is not just an approximation .",
    "thus , the theory of ribbons is mathematically simpler than the theory of tubules .",
    "because the free energy for ribbons is equivalent to the free energy for tubules , we can carry over our results from the theory of tubules in sec .",

    "iii , but with the renormalized rigidity @xmath176 in place of the bare rigidity @xmath177",

    "first , many experiments have seen helical markings that wind around tubules , giving tubules a chiral substructure .",
    "clearly , helical ribbons always have a chiral structure .",
    "it is reasonable that the observed chirality of these microstructures results from a chiral packing of the molecules .",
    "second , recent experiments have found that diacetylenic lipid tubules have a very strong circular dichroism , which indicates a local chiral packing of the molecules , regardless of whether a chiral pattern is visible on the surface of the cylinder  @xcite .",
    "the same diacetylenic lipid molecules in solution or in large spherical vesicles have very low circular dichroism .",
    "these results show that the molecular packing in tubules is chiral , while the molecular packing in spherical vesicles is not chiral .",
    "so far , there has not been any direct test of our prediction of tilt modulation  no experiments have been sensitive to the local direction of molecular tilt in tubules .",
    "however , the helical markings on tubules provide indirect evidence for this prediction . in some cases , these helical markings are boundaries between sections of tubules with different numbers of bilayers in the walls . however , in other cases , helical markings appear even when there is no detectable discontinuity in the number of bilayers , as in fig .",
    "[ tubulephoto ] .",
    "these helical markings are apparently stable , because they do not anneal away in time , and hence seem to be a characteristic of the equilibrium state of tubules .",
    "our interpretation is that these helical markings are the orientational domain walls predicted by our theory . in this interpretation ,",
    "the domain walls are visible in electron micrographs because impurities accumulate there and colloidal particles from the solution preferentially adsorb there .",
    "such preferential diffusion of impurities to orientational domain walls has been observed directly in langmuir monolayers  @xcite .",
    "of course , this interpretation of the observed helical markings provides only indirect support for our theory . for a more direct test of our theory",
    ", one would need an experiment that can directly probe the local direction of molecular tilt .",
    "one possible experimental technique is fluourescence microscopy with polarized laser excitation .",
    "this technique has been used to observe variations in the local tilt direction in langmuir monolayers  @xcite . to apply this technique to tubules",
    ", one would either ( a )  use the intrinsic fluorescence of the constituent amphiphilic molecules , ( b )  attach a fluorescent group to the molecules , or ( c )  put a fluorescent probe into the membrane that forms tubules . one",
    "would then illuminate the tubules with polarized light from a laser source .",
    "variations in the direction of molecular tilt would then lead to variations in the intensity of fluorescence , which could be detected using confocal microscopy or near - field scanning optical microscopy . through this approach ,",
    "optical techniques could detect the predicted helical modulation in the tilt direction in the modulated state .",
    "the ripples in tubule curvature predicted by our theory may be the modulations seen by yager",
    "_ et al . _",
    "@xcite and by thomas _",
    "et al . _",
    "electron micrographs taken in those experiments show very clear helical variations in the tubule curvature .",
    "however , other experiments have not observed any ripples on tubules , within the resolution of the electron micrographs .",
    "the preliminary data are not yet sufficient to explain why ripples are seen in some experiments but not in others .    our prediction of a first - order transition between the uniform and modulated states of tubules also has some experimental support .",
    "et al . _ have measured the magnetic birefringence and specific heat of both single - bilayer and multi - bilayer tubules , as functions of temperature through the melting transition  @xcite .",
    "they find that single - bilayer tubules undergo a second - order melting transition , with strong pretransitional effects , while multi - bilayer tubules undergo a first - order melting transition .",
    "furthermore , single - bilayer tubules show an anomalous peak in the specific heat about 3  degrees _ below _ the main peak associated with melting into the untilted phase .",
    "this anomalous peak is consistent with our predicted transition between the modulated and the uniform states of tubules .",
    "the modulated state should occur in the 3  degree window between the anomalous peak and the main melting peak , where the membrane elastic constants are low , and the uniform state should occur at lower temperatures , below the anomalous peak .",
    "thus , our theory may explain this heat - capacity anomaly .    as a final point",
    ", we note that our theory for the modulated state of tubules leads to an interesting scenario for the kinetic evolution of flat membranes or large spherical vesicles into tubules .",
    "this scenario , first proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ kinetics ] . when a flat membrane or large spherical vesicle is cooled from an untilted into a tilted phase",
    ", it develops tilt order . because of the molecular chirality , the tilt order forms a series of stripes separated by domain walls , as shown in fig .",
    "[ kinetics]a .",
    "each stripe forms a ripple in the membrane curvature , and each domain wall forms a ridge in the membrane .",
    "thus , the domain walls are narrow regions where different parts of the amphiphilic molecules come into contact with neighboring molecules and with the solvent . as a result ,",
    "the domain walls become weak lines in the membrane , and the membrane tends to fall apart along those lines .",
    "the membrane thereby forms a series of narrow ribbons .",
    "these ribbons are free to twist in solution to form helices , as shown in fig .",
    "[ kinetics]b .",
    "those helices may remain as stable helical ribbons , or alternatively they may grow wider to form tubules , as shown in fig .",
    "[ kinetics]c .",
    "note that this proposed mechanism for tubule formation can only operate if the initial vesicle size is larger than the favored ribbon width .",
    "if the initial vesicle is too small , it can not transform into a tubule .",
    "this prediction is consistent with the experimental observation that large spherical vesicles ( with diameter greater than 1  @xmath0 m ) form tubules upon cooling , while small spherical vesicles ( diameter less than 0.05  @xmath0 m ) do not  @xcite .",
    "thus , the theoretical prediction of stripes in the tilt direction gives some insight into the kinetics of the tubule - formation process .",
    "in conclusion , in this paper we have shown the range of possible states that can occur in tubules .",
    "tubules can have a uniform state , as was considered by earlier investigators , but they can also have a modulated state , with a periodic helical variation in direction of molecular tilt and in the curvature of the membrane .",
    "there is at least indirect evidence that the modulated state occurs in actual experimental systems .",
    "a more definitive test of this theoretical prediction requires direct experimental probes of variations in the molecular tilt direction .",

    "<S> we present a general theory for the equilibrium structure of cylindrical tubules and helical ribbons of chiral lipid membranes . </S>",
    "<S> this theory is based on a continuum elastic free energy that permits variations in the direction of molecular tilt and in the curvature of the membrane . </S>",
    "<S> the theory shows that the formation of tubules and helical ribbons is driven by the chirality of the membrane . </S>",
    "<S> tubules have a first - order transition from a uniform state to a helically modulated state , with periodic stripes in the tilt direction and ripples in the curvature . </S>",
    "<S> helical ribbons can be stable structures , or they can be unstable intermediate states in the formation of tubules . </S>"
