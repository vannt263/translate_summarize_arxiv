    "<S> this observation raises the question : which contributions to the pinning potential are responsible for the asymmetry </S>",
    "<S> ? + the _ surface modulation _ of the pb film can not explain the asymmetry of the @xmath1 curves , since its contribution to the pinning potential is not depending on the direction of @xmath3 . for the same reason , the high _ magnetic permeability _ of the ferromagnetic material can not be the origin of the asymmetry . for magnetic dots with perpendicular anisotropy as pinning centres , the asymmetric behaviour has been related to the interaction between the magnetic moments @xmath28 of the magnetic dots and the applied field @xmath61 , in terms of a _ magnetic interaction energy _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . evaluating this term for the magnetic antidots </S>",
    "<S> , the clearest matching effects should appear when @xmath3 and @xmath60 have opposite polarity ( in this case fls are forced into the position of the antidots , which are acting as sharply defined pinning centers ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to what is observed in this experiment , therefore the term @xmath62 can not dominate the pinning potential . + </S>",
    "<S> recent vortex imaging experiments investigating in - plane magnetized dots in contact with a superconductor have shown that the stray field of the dots can induce vortex - like structures in the superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> these induced vortices play a crucial role in the flux pinning properties of the dots @xcite . also for magnetic dots with out - of - plane magnetization , </S>",
    "<S> the existence of induced vortices has been predicted by theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic antidots have the inverse geometry of magnetic dots , therefore the stray fields of dots and antidots are very similar to each other . </S>",
    "<S> we will now show that the asymmetric @xmath1 curves in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mh ] can be explained by the presence of such stray field induced vortices in the superconductor . + based on the above considerations for magnetic dots , we propose the following model when magnetic antidots are used as pinning centers : the presence of the stray field will create supercurrents in the superconductor . in order to estimate the magnitude of the stray field , </S>",
    "<S> we have carried out magnetostatical calculations ( based on the theory in @xcite ) for magnetic antidots with the same geometry and magnetization as in this experiment . at a height of @xmath63 above the surface of the co / pt multilayer </S>",
    "<S> , the amount of flux that is created by the ferromagnet corresponds to about @xmath64 ( @xmath44 is the flux quantum ) in each unit cell of the magnetic antidot array . </S>",
    "<S> hence , it appears reasonable to assume that the local stray fields can not be completely shielded by the meissner currents and at least one vortex per unit cell of the magnetic antidot array is created by the stray field . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that different unit cells contain different amounts of flux quanta , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _  when the average created flux in one unit cell above the ferromagnet is @xmath65 , with @xmath66 a non - integer number . </S>",
    "<S> + in the @xmath35 state , we assume that these induced vortices with a local magnetic field @xmath67 will be located at the interstitial positions of the antidot array ( see black arrows in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ model ] ) . since stray field emanating from the co / </S>",
    "<S> pt multilayer must return somewhere , antivortices with @xmath68 will appear at the position of the antidots ( grey arrows in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ model ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of vortex - antivortex pairs induced by stray field is also predicted in the case of magnetic dots with out - of - plane magnetization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> vortices and antivortices can not annihilate , since the vortices must be located at the interstitial positions , whereas the antivortices are fixed at the antidots </S>",
    "<S> . the number of antivortices and vortices in the superconductor in zero field must be the same ( neglecting effects at the sample boundary ) . </S>",
    "<S> + we will now discuss how the behaviour of the system in an applied magnetic field can be described by means of the above model . to avoid any confusion concerning the use of the terms _ vortex , antivortex _ and _ fl _ </S>",
    "<S> , we will always use the terms _ vortices _ and _ antivortices _ when they are induced by the magnetic co / pt multilayer ( vortices located at the interstices and antivortices at the antidots ) and _ fls _ when they are created by an externally applied field . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath69 is applied , the additional fls will interact with the vortices and antivortices . </S>",
    "<S> if fls and vortices have the same field polarity , they have a repulsive interaction , while fls and vortices with opposite field polarity attract each other . </S>",
    "<S> the antivortices are fixed at the position of the antidots and therefore form a strongly regular pinning potential for the fll , with a period corresponding to the period of the antidot array . </S>",
    "<S> the vortices at the interstitial positions are more mobile and do not form such a regular array , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ model ] . </S>",
    "<S> + when @xmath70 and @xmath35 , fls and antivortices have an attractive interaction and therefore , matching effects and an enhanced value of @xmath45 are observed . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath71 and @xmath35 , fls and antivortices have the same polarity and repel each other , so that the fls are forced into the interstitial positions . </S>",
    "<S> hence , a lower value of @xmath45 and only weak matching effects are observed compared to the case when @xmath70 and @xmath35 . </S>",
    "<S> this model also explains the reversal of the asymmetry when the film is magnetized in the opposite direction ( @xmath32 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the almost symmetric @xmath1 curve obtained for demagnetized magnetic antidots ( @xmath72 ) can be explained by the absence of an asymmetric pinning potential . due to the domain structure ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mfm]_c _ ) ) , antivortices can also appear at the interstitial positions . </S>",
    "<S> however , the weak matching effects at @xmath73 and @xmath52 indicate that the pinning potential still has a certain periodicity , _ </S>",
    "<S> e.g. _ , due to non - magnetic contributions such as the surface modulation of the pb . </S>",
    "<S> + in conclusion , a lattice of antidots in a magnetic film with perpendicular anisotropy creates a strong pinning potential for flux lines in a type - ii superconductor . pronounced asymmetric @xmath1 curves are observed , indicating significantly enhanced pinning when @xmath60 and @xmath3 are parallel . to explain this asymmetry , </S>",
    "<S> a qualitative model is proposed which is based on the presence of vortices and antivortices induced by the stray field of the magnetic antidots . </S>",
