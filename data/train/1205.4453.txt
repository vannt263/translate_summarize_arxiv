    "baroclinic instability is a generic flow instability that occurs in rotating , stably - stratified fluids subject to a meridional ( northward ) temperature gradient .",
    "examples of such a fluid are planetary atmospheres and oceans .",
    "the temperature gradient induces a vertical ( altitudinal ) shear in the mean flow by thermal wind balance ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; hence , baroclinic flows are those that nominally vary in the vertical direction .",
    "the instability itself is important because it gives rise to large- and meso - scale weather systems on planets .",
    "it also serves as a source of turbulence , which has been invoked as the initial condition in some simulations of extrasolar planets to generate plausible initial jet profiles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more importantly , the instability is a source of spatio - temporal variability which could be observed remotely .",
    "baroclinic instability on extrasolar planets has not been studied thus far . in this work",
    "we perform a simple linear analysis of a horizontally uniform jet in vertical shear .",
    "we also use a highly - accurate pseudospectral general circulation model ( gcm ) which solves the hydrostatic primitive equations to study the non - linear evolution of a non - uniform , gradient - wind balanced jet on an extrasolar planet .",
    "the primitive equations solved govern the large - scale dynamics of planetary atmospheres ( e.g. holton 1992 ; see also cho et al .",
    "2008 for some discussion relevant to the present work ) . here",
    "the main focus is on close - in gaseous planets , as they remain the best studied type of extrasolar planets thus far .",
    "however , much of the findings and discussion apply to hot extrasolar planets in general  regardless of whether a solid boundary is present or the radiatively stable layer extends deeply into the planet .    for concreteness ,",
    "we present calculations for a model planet with physical parameters appropriate for the extrasolar giant planet hd209458b ( table  1 ) .",
    "we focus on the stability of broad , high - speed zonal jets  positive ( eastward ) at the equator and negative ( westward ) at high latitude  under adiabatic ( i.e. heating and cooling rates balanced in the net ) situation . by ` broad ' we mean a width of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the rossby deformation length ( section  [ csp ] ) , and ` high - speed ' means the speed is @xmath21000  m  s@xmath3 at the core of the jet .",
    "such jets are commonly produced in diabatically - forced gcm simulations of close - in extrasolar giant planets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a study of adiabatic behaviour is needed because it provides the necessary baseline for comparing the instability under forced conditions and because , in many circumstances , the produced jets are not maintained by the applied thermal forcing ( but some flow - modified version , away from the specified radiative equilibrium ) .",
    "our basic approach in this work is to carefully study baroclinic instability in sufficient generality , without complicating the fundamental process with details which are still uncertain for extrasolar planets .",
    "the primary aim here is three - fold : 1 ) to ascertain the importance of baroclinic instability as a generic process operating on extrasolar planets ; 2 ) to gain a better understanding of the outputs from current extrasolar planet gcm simulations , made difficult by the complexity of solving the primitive equations accurately ; and , 3 ) to explore fundamental issues in baroclinic instability that have received less emphasis in traditional geophysical fluid dynamics studies , due to the markedly different parameter regime of many extrasolar planets compared to that of the earth .",

    "linear growth rates and phase speeds are calculated for the traditional primitive equations on the ` @xmath4-plane ' , a differentially rotating plane tangent to the surface of the planet at a given latitude . in section  [ non - linear ]",
    "we present the non - linear evolution of the instability , obtained from full numerical simulations .",
    "this section also presents the description of the numerical model and setup , as well as the non - convergence of under - resolved and/or over - dissipated simulations .",

    "these conditions are useful for assessing stability of any basic flow configuration .",
    "however , they do not provide quantitative information , such as the growth rates of unstable modes and phase speeds of waves / eddies generated by the instability .    for the earth ,",

    "the qg equations ( the above advection equation for @xmath56 plus boundary conditions ) derive from the more complete primitive equations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the standard qg equations are appropriate for large - scale motions on many planets , away from the low latitudes .",
    "however , they are not broadly appropriate for a large number of extrasolar planets , which are characterized by @xmath36 of order unity ( see table  [ table - params ] )  even away from the equatorial region .",
    "more importantly , much dynamics of interest on extrasolar planets occur in the equatorial region ( section  [ equatorial ] ) , where the traditional qg theory does formally break down .",
    "therefore , we perform our stability analysis using the full primitive equations .      in the standard pressure ( @xmath58 ) coordinate system @xcite , the hydrostatic primitive equations read :    [ pe ] @xmath59    here @xmath60 is the ( zonal , meridional ) velocity in the frame rotating with @xmath7 , where @xmath61 ; @xmath62 is the ` vertical ' velocity , where @xmath63 with @xmath64 operating along constant surfaces of @xmath58 ( which in general is not materially conserved ) ; @xmath65 is the potential temperature , where @xmath66 is the temperature , @xmath32 is the reference pressure , @xmath67 with @xmath29 the gas constant and @xmath30 the specific heat at constant pressure ; @xmath68 is the geopotential above the planetary radius @xmath27 , where @xmath26 is the constant surface gravity ; @xmath69 ; and , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are , respectively , momentum and potential temperature sources / dissipations . from here on , we exclusively work in @xmath58-coordinate and drop the tilde over the advective and gradient operators for notational clarity .    the above set of equations is closed with the ideal gas law , @xmath72 .",
    "the equations are also supplemented with the boundary conditions , @xmath73 hence , the domain boundaries are material surfaces and no mass flows across them .      in this section ,",

    "the @xmath4-plane is a tangent plane located at @xmath53 , and the setup is only formally justified for scales that are small compared to @xmath27 .",
    "however , in practice the @xmath4-plane approximation mainly results in small distortion of planetary waves and captures the essential qualitative behavior . for the analysis in this section , we neglect source / dissipation terms in equations  ( [ pe ] ) ",
    "i.e. @xmath78 .",
    "this is because , as discussed in section  [ introduction ] , we are interested in the dynamics of jets that result from conditions e.g. when the net heating is not large or the effective thermal relaxation time is not small .",
    "we perform a standard normal mode analysis of the baroclinic instability admitted by a two - layer representation of equations  ( [ pe ] ) .",
    "similar work has been carried out by @xcite and @xcite for the earth . as in these studies ,",

    "it follows from equations  ( [ 2l - pe]e ) and ( [ 2l - pe]f ) that barotropic ( vertically averaged ) wind is non - divergent . in the present analysis",
    ", we take the brunt - visl frequency @xmath35 to be uniform ; gcm simulations by @xcite show static stability to be fairly constant over one or two scale heights for a wide range of conditions .",

    "baroclinic instability in the two - level primitive equations system is obtained from perturbations of an unstable ` eady - type ' basic flow with uniform vertical shear @xcite : @xmath86 here @xmath87 characterizes the strength of the thermal wind and its shear ; and , @xmath88 is related to the reference static stability , @xmath89 , through @xmath90 for simplicity we shall consider meridionally - independent perturbations applied to the above basic flow .",
    "we now linearize equations  ( [ 2l - pe ] ) about this basic state and arrive at the following :    @xmath91    the temperature equation  ( 4c ) is obtained by summing equations  ( [ 2l - pe]c ) and ( [ 2l - pe]d ) and linearising .",

    "two of the roots of equation  ( [ baroclinic_dimfreq ] ) are stable eastward- and westward - traveling inertia - gravity waves .",
    "the other two roots are baroclinic waves .",
    "these waves propagate neutrally ( i.e. without growing or decaying ) eastward and westward , if @xmath117 ( provided @xmath118 ) .            the baroclinic wave solutions to equation  ( [ baroclinic_dimfreq ] )",

    "note here that unstable baroclinic waves travel westward relative to the mean flow ( @xmath123 ) .    from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] it can be seen that the wavelength of the most unstable mode at @xmath124 is @xmath125  m , corresponding to 1.8  undulations ( i.e. @xmath22 crests and troughs each ) at this latitude .",

    "hence , jets centred at lower latitudes have increased growth times with modestly increased wavelengths of the most unstable mode .",
    "significantly , linear analysis predicts stability for jets located at or equator - ward of @xmath132 ( see e.g. the flat , blue curve labelled ` hd25 ' ) .    to illustrate the dependence of the growth rate and phase speed on the characteristic flow speed ( or , equivalently , shear strength )",

    "[ fig2 ] result obtained for the case with @xmath133  m  s@xmath3 at @xmath128 ( black curve labelled ` hd45l ' ) . comparing the ` hd45 ' ( green ) and ` hd45l ' ( black ) curves , we see immediately that the growth rate of the most unstable mode decreases significantly for the smaller @xmath134 case .",
    "the instability takes @xmath24 times longer to develop in the weaker speed / shear case .",
    "we also note that the wavelength of the most unstable mode decreases slightly . hence",
    ", as @xmath134 decreases , the number of undulations increases for a jet located at a given latitude .",
    "the qualitative behaviour described above is not restricted to hd209458b .",
    "it applies to any planet that has a meridional temperature gradient . to illustrate the general applicability of our results , we present in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the growth rates and phase speeds at @xmath135 for several planets : earth , jupiter and gj436b ( red , green and black curves , respectively ) . for the earth ,",
    "the wavelength of the most unstable mode is 4100  km , corresponding to @xmath136 undulations at midlatitude , with growth rate of @xmath137 ( i.e. growth time of 15  hours ) .",
    "this is consistent with many studies of baroclinic instability on the earth ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the corresponding values of undulations for jupiter and gj436b are @xmath243 and @xmath21 with growth rates @xmath138 and @xmath139 , respectively . accordingly",
    ", if baroclinic instability occurs on these planets , it appears jupiter simulations must be of very high resolution to capture the instability . on the other hand ,",
    "the instability at the midlatitude of gj436b would clearly be of planetary scale and thus may lead to a possible observable variability signal for this planet on a timescale of @xmath1401.8  planetary rotations .",
    "note that the phase speeds of the unstable baroclinic waves on earth and jupiter are very small ( close to zero ) compared to those on the extrasolar planets , hd209458b and gj436b .",
    "we have also carried out linear growth rate analysis with the two - layer qg model for hd209458b and have compared the results with those from the primitive equations model , presented above . in the two models ,",
    "the growth rates at high latitudes and midlatitudes are equivalent to within @xmath141 per cent . however , at low latitudes , the qg model overestimates the growth rates by approximately 25 per cent . moreover , the qg model predicts instability down to @xmath142 , whereas the primitive equations model predicts instability only down to @xmath143 . below these latitudes ,",
    "both models predict stability .",
    "thus , ageostrophy appears to provide a stabilizing factor in this case . given that inertia - gravity waves are not filtered in the primitive equations model ( as they are in the qg model )",
    ", the enhanced stability may be due to the gravity waves ` leaking away ' some of the energy that drive the instability .",
    "the preceding analysis is highly idealised .",
    "therefore , it has limitations .",
    "for example , in general , planetary jets possess a three - dimensional structure  with concurrent vertical and meridional shears , as well as zonal asymmetry .",
    "also , the atmosphere is continuously stratified .",
    "one effect of a two - layer discretisation with uniform zonal flow in each layer is the inability to capture the symmetry breaking between eastward and westward jets .",
    "these limitations are discussed more in detail below .    in flows with both vertical and horizontal shears ,",
    "the growth of unstable baroclinic waves may be suppressed by the ` barotropic governor ' effect ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the effect is not fundamentally related to the sign of the jet , but a key ingredient is a counter - gradient eddy momentum flux @xmath144 generated under a horizontally sheared flow ; here the overbar indicates a zonal average .",
    "the shear and the momentum flux reinforce each other to distort the meridional structure of the wave , suppressing the growth rate and shortening the wavelength of the most unstable mode .",
    "thus , the full non - linear evolution of the instability exhibits lower growth rates and shorter wavelengths , compared with those indicated by the linear analysis presented in this section ( see section  [ non - linear ] ) .",
    "the atmosphere is also continuously stratified .",
    "a representation more realistic than a two - layer model changes the instability properties described in this section .",
    "the main change is that the short - wave and long - wave cut - offs in the two - layer representation ( see figs .  [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] ) no longer exist in the continuum of unstable modes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the retained modes ( charney and green modes , discussed below ) are not expected to change qualitatively the asymptotic behaviour of the instability . however , they do provide additional modes for wave - wave interaction during the non - linear growth phase  hence , affect the details of the evolution ; this may be significant for finite - time variability .",
    "another limitation of the linear model presented is that it does not distinguish between the signs of the jet ( or shear ) .",
    "this is because symmetry is preserved under the interchange of the shear sign , given the laterally uniform flow ; hence , distinction between the two signs is not expected .",
    "this is in contrast to the flow used in the non - linear calculation ( section  [ non - linear ] ) , in which the growth rate for an unstable westward ( negative shear ) jet is smaller than that for the unstable eastward ( positive shear ) jet at the same latitude .",
    "the two signed flows behave differently in this case because of the change in the sign of the jet curvature . furthermore",
    ", a westward jet has only one unstable mode ( charney mode ) as opposed to an eastward jet , which has an infinite number of unstable modes ( green modes ) .",
    "a similar observation has been made by @xcite , who observed a difference between eastward- and westward - sheared baroclinic flows in the charney model ( continuously stratified qg model on the @xmath4-plane ) .",
    "he has pointed out that the maximum growth rate for the absolute value of non - dimensional shear is substantially smaller for a flow with westward shear than a flow with eastward shear . moreover , while the eastward jet is baroclinically unstable for any value of vertical shear @xmath145 , the westward jet is unstable only if @xmath146 note that , at @xmath128 , the critical shear for hd209458b parameters used in this work is : @xmath147  s@xmath3 .",
    "the shear of the unstable westward jet described in section  [ westward ] is @xmath148  s@xmath3 , consistent with  ( [ crit_shear ] ) .",
    "to study the full non - linear evolution , we use a well - tested parallel pseudospectral model , bob @xcite .",
    "this model solves equations  ( [ pe ] ) in spherical geometry , subject to the boundary conditions  ( [ bc ] ) . as in many models , the equations in the vorticity",
    " divergence form are solved , where ( relative ) vorticity is @xmath149 and divergence is @xmath150 .",
    "the equations in this form are more amenable for the spectral transform method @xcite .",
    "domain decomposed spectral transform algorithm is used in the horizontal direction and standard second order finite difference scheme is used in the vertical direction .",
    "the latter direction is in pressure coordinates in the numerical model .    to follow the evolution over long duration , explicit dissipation",
    "is applied so that artificial accumulation of energy at small scales is prevented ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "asselin time filter @xmath154 @xcite is applied , at every time step and in each layer , to filter the computational mode arising from using a second - order time - marching scheme ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "no other numerical dissipators , fixers , stabilisers or filters are used in performing the simulations .      to study the non - linear evolution of baroclinic instability , we initialize our model with an idealized jet that satisfies the necessary condition for baroclinic instability , the charney - stern - pedlosky condition described in section  [ linear ] .",
    "the jet is initially set to be either eastward or westward , and centred at a latitude between @xmath155 to @xmath156n .",
    "a large number of simulations have been performed for this study , carefully varying each parameter ( jet location , strength , shear , profile , direction as well as domain size , etc . ) in an independent series of simulations . a very small subset of these runs , which we use for discussions in sections  [ setup ] to [ equatorial ] ,",

    "this ` problem - dependence ' conclusion has also been discussed by @xcite for ` spin - up ' experiments of hot giant planet circulations .    before presenting the results ,",
    "a brief discussion concerning our general approach to convergence testing is in order . in general , for numerical stability reasons ,",
    "the usual practice is to use a larger dissipation coefficient value when performing a calculation with lower resolution  or , alternatively , a smaller coefficient value when performing the same calculation at higher resolution  so that the damping time is same at the truncation scale .",
    "this results in a different damping time for a given mode at different resolutions . however , here our aim is to demonstrate convergence of the numerical model .",
    "hence , we employ the same value of the coefficient at all resolutions so that each mode , up to the truncation , experiences same dissipation rate in all the runs .",
    "the employed value is : @xmath287  m@xmath198  s@xmath3 .",
    "similar methodology has been implemented in e.g. @xcite to test convergence in the earth case .",
    "later , we also demonstrate non - convergence when the damping time is chosen such that it is same at the truncation scale for all resolutions , as in the usual practice .",
    "the requirement of adequate resolution is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] .",
    "the figure shows a set of four simulations with all parameters identical to run eeq presented in section  [ equatorial ]  except the resolution .",
    "the resolutions are : t21  ( a ) , t42  ( b ) , t85  ( c ) and t170  ( d ) .",
    "note , panel ( d ) is run eeq .",
    "all four runs use the same value of superviscosity coefficient , @xmath288  m@xmath198 s@xmath3 , as already mentioned . note also that the resolutions correspond , respectively , to 64@xmath19532 , 128@xmath19564 , 256@xmath195128 and 512@xmath195256 gaussian grids in physical space .",
    "but , because of the exponential convergence property of the spectral method , they are equivalent in accuracy to finite difference grids @xmath289 times finer in resolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "polar stereographic projections of the relative vorticity field @xmath213 at @xmath290 are shown , when the instability is in the early exponentially - growing stage ( see fig .  [ fig7 ] ) .    visual inspection of the fields readily reveals that the t21  ( a ) and t42  ( b ) runs do not converge to the t170  ( d ) run .",
    "the t85  ( c ) run is marginally converged , though this may change after a long time ( e.g. many hundreds of planetary rotations ) . in the figure , frames  ( a ) and  ( b ) are qualitatively different than frames ( c ) and ( d ) , which clearly show mode-6 instability .",
    "the t85 run in frame  ( c ) captures the basic structure present in the t170 run in frame  ( d ) .",
    "however , spurious small - scale oscillations are also clearly visible in frame  ( c ) ; these are not present in frame  ( d ) .",
    "the small - scale oscillations contaminate the calculation  causing the calculation to blow up , depending on the numerical parameters used ; see e.g. discussion in @xcite .",
    "the above behavior can be quantified by computing the corresponding kinetic energy spectra for each run .",
    "the spectra for the fields shown in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] are presented in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] .",
    "inspection of the t85 and t170 spectra ( red and black lines , respectively ) confirms the convergence of the simulations .",
    "note the presence of a clear dissipation range in the t170 run .",
    "in contrast , the appearance of nearly grid - scale waves in physical space for t21 and t42 resolution runs corroborates the tendency of the spectrum ( blue and pink lines for t21 and t42 , respectively ) in these runs to peel off and curl up considerably left of the aliasing limit ( @xmath14021 for t21 and @xmath14042 for t42 ) .",
    "this is caused by discretization errors that are not adequately controlled by the applied explicit viscosity .",
    "we have also performed an analogous series of runs in which a much larger dissipation coefficient value , @xmath291  m@xmath198  s@xmath3 has been used .",
    "this mimics ` properly ' dissipated runs at t21 and t42 resolutions ( i.e. runs with well represented dissipation range in spectral space ) .",
    "however , in this series the high resolution calculations are significantly over - dissipated and the physical space picture is characterised by a severe reduction in eddy kinetic energy at all times .",
    "this is supported by the spectra for two t170 resolution simulations with the two coefficients ( right frame of fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] ) . the spectrum for a run using @xmath292  m@xmath198  s@xmath3 ( black line )",
    "is shown together with the spectrum of the previously presented t170 run with @xmath288  m@xmath198  s@xmath3 ( red line ) . with the larger @xmath153 ,",
    "the spectrum is severely over - dissipated with only @xmath293 modes being resolved ; the rest of the modes clearly lie in the dissipation range .",
    "in contrast , at least @xmath294 modes are well - resolved with the smaller @xmath153 value .",
    "it is important to understand that wavenumbers short - ward of the fiducial ` dissipation range ' ( i.e. less than 20 and 80 , respectively , in the runs discussed above ) are still affected by a small amount of dissipation in practice : that is , dissipation affects the entire spectrum of wavenumbers continuously , rather than just the wavenumbers in the dissipation range .",
    "the amount , while small , can nevertheless be _ dynamically _ significant , as it can change the quantitative character of the instability , even suppress the instability altogether .",
    "indeed , if the value of @xmath153 is increased further , to @xmath295  m@xmath198  s@xmath3 , the baroclinic waves completely disappear .",
    "as discussed above , a common practice in numerical studies which vary the resolution is to adjust the dissipation coefficient @xmath153 so that the damping time @xmath296 is same at the truncation scale @xmath297 : @xmath298 ^ 2.\\ ] ] while the physical basis of this procedure is arguable , we demonstrate here that the practice still does not lead to convergence at low resolution . consider the value , @xmath299  m@xmath198  s@xmath3 , used in the high resolution simulation discussed above .",
    "the dissipation rate at the truncation scale for hd209458b corresponding to this @xmath153 value is @xmath300  s@xmath301 .",
    "note that this damping rate is comparable to the rates used in current flow modeling studies of hot gaseous extrasolar planet atmospheres at resolutions lower than t170 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "its significance can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig17 ] .",
    "[ fig17 ] shows the effects of adjusting @xmath153 so that the damping rate is constant at the truncation scale .",
    "the rate used is the one just discussed above : @xmath302  s@xmath3 .",
    "relative vorticity field @xmath213 at four resolutions for run eeq at @xmath290 is shown .",
    "two points are clear from the figure . first , the simulations in this series are not converged .",
    "the t21 and t42 resolution runs are completely over - dissipated and the momentum and heat transports are absent throughout the duration of the runs , up to @xmath281 .",
    "second , the @xmath153 values used in current gcm modelling studies of hot extrasolar giant planets do not permit the instability .",
    "note that , if the dissipation rate is chosen instead to be the one that ` adequately ' permits the instability in the low resolution run , the high resolution runs are severely under - dissipated and inundated with noise ( not shown ) .",
    "either way , convergence is not achieved by fixing the dissipation rate at the truncation scale .",
    "arguably , the two points above may not be significant for atmospheres characterized by a very short diabatic relaxation time . for",
    "then the thermal damping would dominate and naturally short - circuit the above issues pertaining to the artificial viscosity and resolution .",
    "however , in some gcm simulations , the dynamically - relevant , intrinsic thermal relaxation time is not always short after quasi - equilibration is reached , even above the @xmath21  bar level ( thrastarson ( private communication ) ) .",
    "moreover , the instabilities at higher latitudes possess short growth times and are much less affected by short relaxation times .",
    "additionally , there is the issue of transient growth , which we have not discussed in this work .",
    "the non - normal modes , associated with such growth , may operate on a much shorter time scale than the growths described in this work .",
    "we stress here that the high resolution runs described do not merely contain more fine - scale structures that presumably do not significantly affect the evolution . on the contrary",
    ", we have found that high resolution fundamentally affects the evolution .",
    "for example , bulk eddy heat- and momentum - fluxes differ significantly ( up to an order of magnitude ) in high- and low - resolution simulations .",
    "the reason for this is that vorticity anomalies ( eddies ) are much stronger , in addition to the filaments , in the high - resolution simulations ; and , growth is exponential in the stage of the evolution when these structures have emerged ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "hence , heat and momentum are redistributed much more effectively .",
    "baroclinic instability on extrasolar planets has not been studied thus far . in this work",
    "we have used an advanced pseudospectral gcm to perform an extensive study of the stability and non - linear evolution of balanced jets on hot extrasolar planets .",
    "our non - linear baroclinic instability calculations have been fully validated against previous similar calculations for the earth ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for concreteness ,",
    "we have presented here results for a model planet with physical parameters corresponding to the close - in giant planet hd209458b and focused on the stability of high - speed ( typically 1000  ms@xmath3 ) eastward jets at the equator and westward jets at high latitudes .",
    "broad jets of such magnitude are a common feature in current gcm simulations of tidally - synchronized giant planet atmospheres .    we have derived linear growth rate and phase speed spectra , via standard normal mode analysis , and compared the results with full non - linear numerical simulations . according to our linear analysis of the two - layer primitive equations model on the @xmath4-plane , the growth rate of the instability is reduced for a jet located at low latitudes , compared with a jet located at high latitudes . near the equator , where the deformation length scale @xmath1 becomes too large to accommodate baroclinic waves",
    ", the linear theory predicts stability . in general",
    ", linear analysis agrees reasonably well with the full non - linear calculations at the early stage of the unstable evolution , during the transient phase . after a long time , in simulations with high values of initial potential vorticity anomaly ( i.e. @xmath303 , where @xmath304 is the anomaly ) , cyclones merge to form robust monolithic vortices at the poles .",
    "this is not captured by linear analysis .",
    "as expected , full non - linear calculations show richer behavior than that obtained through linear analysis .",
    "non - linear simulations show that baroclinic instability occurs for all eastward jet profiles used in this study .",
    "in particular , broad equatorial eastward jets are unstable ( on a time scale of @xmath220  planetary rotations ) , despite stability suggested by the linear analysis .",
    "the instability takes place at the jet flanks , where there is still a significant vertical shear to satisfy the necessary condition for instability .",
    "the jet core is stable , unlike in the jets situated at higher latitudes ; this is in accordance with linear theory .",
    "westward jets near the equator , however , remain stable , both at the core and the flanks . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this is the first time non - linear baroclinic instability has been studied for a broad equatorial jet in the atmosphere . in general , we have found westward jets to be more stable compared to their eastward counterparts ( e.g. at midlatitude , instability timescale of @xmath26  planetary rotations for westward jets vs. @xmath23  planetary rotations for eastward jets ) , and to require much stronger vertical shear for instability in the full primitive equations system .",
    "additionally , we have demonstrated in this work that baroclinic instability does not require a solid boundary on planets , as long as there is a change of sign in the meridional potential vorticity gradient @xmath305 in the domain s interior .    by performing the simulations described above with a wide range of horizontal resolution ( from t21 to t170 )",
    ", we have found that the calculations do not converge for resolutions below t85 .",
    "this is a somewhat stronger requirement than for earth simulations and is primarily due to the much stronger jet amplitude on hot extrasolar planets ( @xmath1401000  m  s@xmath3 , compared to @xmath14050  m  s@xmath3 for the earth ) .",
    "furthermore , we have found that baroclinic instability does not occur at all if the artificial viscosity coefficient used in the calculation is too high .",
    "a high artificial viscosity is often used to stabilize numerical simulations against strong forcing in current studies of extrasolar planet atmospheres . given this",
    ", baroclinic instability is unlikely to be represented in current simulations  even when necessary conditions for instability are satisfied .",
    "this may pose a serious issue in flow modelling studies of extrasolar planet atmospheres in which the natural diabatic relaxation time is not too short ( i.e. greater than a few planetary rotations ) .",
    "the results presented in this paper show that baroclinic instability is significant for understanding characteristics of hot extrasolar planets which possess fast jet streams . this instability is likely to play a role in weather , general circulation and large scale variability of a few to few tens of planetary rotation periods on these planets @xcite .",
    "for example , the process could generate large long - lived storms that could be observed remotely .",
    "sharp fronts produced in baroclinic instability life - cycles can also act as a gravity wave source ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "gravity waves are expected to play an important role in stably stratified atmospheres of hot extrasolar planets : they can modify the circulation through exerting accelerations ( positive and negative ) on the mean flow , as well as transporting heat vertically from deep regions to sensible regions and laterally from day side to night side @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we only discuss adiabatic calculations .",
    "adiabatic calculations are important to cleanly delineate many subtle effects in rotating - stratified fluid that could obscure baroclinic instability .",
    "they are also important as a foundation for the instability under forced conditions , which require careful study .",
    "the complex effects of forcing on the background flow itself remains to be elucidated .",
    "we have also focused mainly on the instability and subsequent evolution of jets in isolation and only lightly touched on the effect of concomitant eddies on the background flow . in summary , the full effect of baroclinic instability on the mean flow on hot extrasolar planets remains to be carefully studied .",
    "some of the issues identified here will be addressed in future work .",
