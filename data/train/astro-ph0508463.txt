    "the mass distribution in elliptical galaxies is difficult to measure , in part because ellipticals do not contain gas or star disks like those found in spiral galaxies .",
    "the mass distribution is particularly uncertain beyond the effective radius , where the surface brightness fades rapidly .",
    "fortunately , globular clusters ( gcs ) are found at large distances in many elliptical galaxies .",
    "for example , more than @xmath7 gcs are believed to be present in m87 outside 3 times the effective radius @xmath8 kpc @xcite .",
    "gcs in nearby galaxies provide relatively bright pointlike sources for which radial velocities can be determined . by analyzing the statistics of the positions and radial velocities of gcs",
    ", we may constrain the mass profiles of their host galaxies and explore the dark matter distribution in the outer parts of elliptical galaxies . planetary nebulae",
    "also provide excellent kinematic probes for similar reasons ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the database of extragalactic gcs with radial velocities has been steadily growing in recent years .",
    "the most intensively observed systems are ngc 1399 @xcite and m87 . in this paper",
    "we examine the latter system . @xcite and @xcite observed the density profile of gcs in m87 out to 110 kpc .",
    "@xcite compiled a list of 43 gcs with radial velocities , from which @xcite derived a mass of @xmath9 m@xmath10 within 50 kpc .",
    "they also estimated that about 200 and 1000 gcs would be required to derive accurately the slope of the mass profile of the galaxy and the velocity anisotropy of the gcs , respectively . @xcite and @xcite obtained radial velocities for 221 gcs .",
    "this dataset was used to study the spin @xcite and mass profile of m87 @xcite .",
    "although there is significant rotation in the m87 gc system , the fractional kinetic energy in rotation @xmath11 is relatively small , so it should be safe to ignore rotation in our analysis and adopt the assumption that the system is spherical @xcite .",
    "thus the data pairs @xmath12 $ ] contain all available dynamical information , where @xmath13 is the projected distance from the gc to the center of the galaxy , and @xmath14 is its velocity in the line of sight . to convert angular distance to physical distance , we adopt a distance to m87 of 16.3 mpc ( i.e. 79 pc arcsec@xmath15 ) following @xcite .",
    "maximum likelihood analysis provides a powerful tool to analyze discrete data .",
    "it was used to derive the mass distribution of spherical galaxies first by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we describe our method for deriving spherical mass distributions from discrete data in section [ sec : tec ] .",
    "we use simulated data to test our method in section [ sec : sim ] . in section",
    "[ sec : m87 ] we constrain the mass profile of m87 and the distribution function ( hereafter df ) of its gcs .",
    "the mass distribution of m87 has been determined from gc kinematics by several authors , including @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the study most similar to ours is that of @xcite .",
    "we compare our method and results to theirs in section [ sec : dis ] .",
    "section [ sec : con ] contains conclusions .",
    "we wish to constrain the potential @xmath16 of a spherical system from a set of discrete data pairs @xmath17 $ ] . in a spherical system ,",
    "the df depends on at most two integrals of motion , energy @xmath18 and scalar angular momentum @xmath19 , and thus takes the form @xmath20 .",
    "we normalize so that @xmath21 we introduce a cartesian coordinate system @xmath22 with origin at the galactic center , and @xmath23-axis along the line of sight . in this system ,",
    "the projected radius is @xmath24 the probability that a given gc is found in the interval @xmath25 is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 because of spherical symmetry , we may assume without losing any information that all gcs lie in the @xmath28 plane and @xmath29 .",

    "this formalism can easily be generalized to account for selection effects and observational errors in radial velocities .",
    "for example , in most surveys we observe gcs only in a limited range of radii @xmath36 . to account for this limitation",
    ", we simply modify the normalization to require that @xmath37 to account for the errors in radial velocities , we just need to calculate @xmath38 with @xmath39 replaced by @xmath40 here we have assumed that the error @xmath41 is the same for all gcs , although the method is easily generalized to individual measurement errors . note that our method also probes , though with less power",
    ", the potential beyond the maximum survey radius @xmath42 , both because we observe the projected distribution , which includes gcs with radial distances to the galactic center larger than @xmath42 , and because some gc orbits have apocenters outside @xmath42 .    in principle , all physically possible potentials and dfs should be explored to maximize @xmath43 .",
    "the most general way to do so is to assume non - parametric forms for both potentials and dfs , but this is cumbersome and computationally expensive .",
    "instead we optimize within a family of parametrized potentials : we assume an analytical form @xmath44 and infer the parameters @xmath45 ( which can be viewed as a row vector ) .",
    "for example , we may assume a power - law density - potential pair @xmath46 where @xmath47 is an arbitrary radius , and then @xmath48 .",
    "we also investigate the @xcite density - potential pair , @xmath49 here @xmath5 is the concentration radius and @xmath50 .",
    "if the df @xmath20 were known , the problem of optimizing the parameters @xmath45 would be easy to solve .",
    "we would calculate @xmath38 as a function of @xmath45 and figure out where @xmath38 peaks .",
    "however , in practice the df is an unknown function , and we have to derive the df and @xmath45 simultaneously .",
    "this can be done by parametric or non - parametric methods .    in the parametric method @xcite , we choose a limited number of basis functions @xmath51 ( i.e. a complete set of basis functions truncated to some order @xmath52 ) , which are smooth in phase space .",
    "thus , the df is approximated as @xmath53 this method ensures that the derived df is smooth ; however , it is difficult to ensure that @xmath54 for all @xmath55 since neither @xmath56 nor @xmath57 is necessarily non - negative . furthermore , if @xmath52 is small we can not ensure that equation ( [ fke ] ) gives a good approximation to the actual df . of course",
    ", we can always increase @xmath52 to improve the approximation , but then we can not ensure that the best - fit df will be smooth .    in the non - parametric method @xcite , we divide the @xmath58 space into @xmath59 bins , which are denoted by the double index @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 . notice that the df is isotropic if @xmath63 and otherwise may be anisotropic .",
    "then we construct a set of top - hat functions , @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the phase - space volume within the survey limits that is associated with bin @xmath60 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath66 here @xmath67 is simply the fraction of gcs in bin @xmath60 , @xmath68 is the phase space density of gcs in bin @xmath60 , and @xmath20 and @xmath69 are normalized so that their integrals over phase space within the survey limits are unity .    in our calculation",
    ", the bin @xmath60 is defined by @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the lower and upper energy limits of the bin , and @xmath73 is the maximum angular momentum at energy @xmath18 , corresponding to a circular orbit .",
    "these bins cover all of the allowed region in @xmath58 space and may also cover some unallowed regions .",
    "each @xmath69 gives a normalized distribution in @xmath74 space , @xmath75 notice that @xmath76 depends on @xmath77 ( thus @xmath45 ) but is independent of the df specified by @xmath78 .",
    "an algorithm for evaluating @xmath76 efficiently is shown in appendix [ sec : appendix ] . to account for errors in radial velocities",
    ", the distribution should be convolved with a one - dimensional gaussian function as in equation ( [ eq : error ] ) .",
    "we use the convolved distribution hereafter and drop the prime symbol for simplicity .    due to the linearity of equations ( [ eq : grvz ] ) and ( [ fel ] )",
    ", we have @xmath79 therefore , for a given set of observations @xmath17 $ ] , the likelihood is a function of @xmath45 and @xmath78 only . for a fixed potential specified by the parameters @xmath45 , we can calculate @xmath80 , then maximize @xmath81 with respect to @xmath78 . we may then vary @xmath45 to search for a global maximum @xmath81 .",
    "an advantage of this method is that we need only ensure that all @xmath67 are non - negative to guarantee that @xmath54 .",
    "however , this method does not generally give smooth dfs . the derived dfs look like the sum of a set of @xmath82-functions @xcite .",
    "this is a drawback , since to some extent the irregularities in the dfs are fitting the statistical fluctuations in the data rather than the signal .",
    "in other words it is an ill - posed problem to infer @xmath83 from a small set of data points .",
    "one way to approach this problem is to maximize a `` penalized likelihood '' instead , which can be defined using entropy maximization @xcite or regularization @xcite .    by adding an entropy term , we maximize the function @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a parameter chosen to control the degree of smoothness of the df , and @xmath86 is a convex function of @xmath87 such as @xmath88 . adding the entropy term tends to force the df to be uniform in phase space ( in the limit of large @xmath85 , the data become irrelevant and the maximum value of @xmath89 occurs for @xmath90 ) .",
    "this tendency is particularly undesirable in our case because there is a large phase volume at high energy , so that large @xmath85 tends to place more gcs in a high energy state .",
    "we have done simulations to test this method and found that the derived df is either too irregular for small @xmath85 or has an excess high energy tail for large @xmath85 .    to implement regularization",
    ", we maximize the function @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are positive parameters that adjust the degree of smoothness of the df and @xmath94 and @xmath95 are dimensionless positive - definite functions of the df .",
    "there are several natural forms for @xmath94 , including @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a normalizing constant .",
    "the names indicate what functions minimize @xmath94 ; for example , the uniform form is zero if @xmath90 , the exponential form is zero if @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is a constant , etc .",
    "the angle brackets denote an average over area in @xmath100 space ; for example , if we use a fixed energy interval for all bins , the exponential form is proportional to @xmath101 in case no @xmath102 is zero . the term @xmath95 smoothing the df along the @xmath19 direction can be written similarly .    before we choose the form of @xmath94 and @xmath95 , it is helpful to discuss the meaning of the regularization term .",
    "equation ( [ eq : q ] ) is equivalent to @xmath103 therefore , maximizing @xmath104 is equivalent to maximizing the posterior probability if the prior probability for @xmath87 is @xmath105 by choosing @xmath92 and @xmath94 , we are assuming some prior information @xmath106 , i.e. , a specific degree of smoothness and shape of the df .",
    "therefore , the smoothing terms assess the physical plausibility of the df @xcite .",
    "generally , dfs of gcs are strongly non - uniform in the sense that they may change amplitude by a few orders of magnitude over the observable range .",
    "for example , given a logarithmic potential and a gc density profile @xmath107 the corresponding isotropic df is @xmath108 over the range @xmath109 , the df at zero velocity will vary by a factor of @xmath110 , which is about 3000 , given that the ratio @xmath111 is 110 kpc/7 kpc @xmath112 15 in the case of m87 ( see  [ sec : m87 ] ) .    given this large variation , neither entropy maximization as in equation ( [ eq : entropy ] ) nor the uniform form of the regularization term in equation ( [ eq : uniformdf ] ) is appropriate , because they tend to favor a uniform df over the entire phase space .",
    "the exponential and power - law forms in equations ( [ eq : expformdf ] ) and ( [ eq : power - lawformdf ] ) give more freedom and favor exponential or power - law forms for the df , which are more physically reasonable .",
    "we adopt the exponential form throughout this paper .    for convenience ,",
    "we define @xmath113 which is @xmath104 maximized with respect to the weights @xmath78 .",
    "the function @xmath114 usually has a number of local maxima in @xmath78 at a fixed set of potential parameters @xmath45 .",
    "we attempt to find the global maximum in this landscape using simulated annealing and the downhill simplex method , as discussed in @xcite . the method does not guarantee that we have found the global maximum , so we try several different initial values of @xmath78 and choose the largest maximum found from any of these initial conditions .",
    "the optimization process turns out to consume most of the computational resources required by this method .",
    "we may also assume some prior information @xmath115 for the potential parameters , which gives a prior probability @xmath116 .",
    "for example , in the power - law potential ( eq .",
    "[ eq : powerlaw ] ) , it is reasonable to assume a uniform prior in @xmath117 , thus we have @xmath118 then the probability distribution of the potential parameters @xmath45 is @xmath119    we may also incorporate the observed surface number density profile @xmath120 of the gcs and its error @xmath121 as an additional constraint in our calculation since this may be available for many more gcs , over a larger survey area than have measured velocities .",
    "we maximize the quantity @xmath122 where both @xmath123 and @xmath124 should be normalized so that @xmath125 and @xmath126 are unity within the survey limit of gc number counting .",
    "how should we choose @xmath92 and @xmath93 ?",
    "if these parameters are set too small , they do not smooth the df at all .",
    "if they are set too large , the df is forced to a specific functional form that may not be demanded by the data .",
    "notice that in contrast to many problems such as least - squares fitting @xcite the likelihood is only known to within a multiplicative constant , so the goodness of fit can only be assessed in a relative sense .",
    "when maximizing @xmath127 ( eq . [ eq : qwp ] ) , we choose smoothing parameters following @xcite .",
    "assume that the minimum @xmath128 in equation ( [ eq : x2 ] ) is @xmath129 in case of no regularization .",
    "then we increase the smoothing parameters so that the minimum @xmath128 is @xmath130 , where @xmath131 corresponds to @xmath132 error .",
    "we call these `` appropriate '' smoothing parameters .",
    "a degeneracy arises in choosing two smoothing parameters from one requirement .",
    "the two parameters @xmath92 and @xmath93 control smoothness in the direction of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively and are not necessarily equal .",
    "fortunately , we find that all `` appropriate '' pairs of smoothing parameters give similar results for derived potentials and energy distributions , although , not surprisingly , the derived anisotropy can be very different depending on the value of @xmath93 . of course",
    ", with more data , the values of smoothing parameters will be subject to tighter constraints .",
    "therefore , we may recover the anisotropy if enough data is available .",
    "we first test our algorithm using simulated data . we choose a df @xmath133 in a power - law potential ( eq . [ eq : powerlaw ] ) with @xmath134 kpc and @xmath135 .",
    "the energy @xmath18 is in units of @xmath136 .",
    "the anisotropy parameter @xmath137 is a constant which we choose in the range from @xmath138 ( extremely radial ) to 5 ( extremely tangential ) .",
    "the df is chosen so that the energy distribution is bimodal , to challenge the algorithm .",
    "we generate 160 kinematic data points within the projected radius range 732 kpc and a surface number density profile from 7000 gcs within the projected radius range 7110 kpc ( these match the properties of the sample of m87 gcs described in  [ sec : m87data ] ) .    in this case ,",
    "figure [ fig : fig1 ] shows the contour plot for @xmath140 for three simulations with @xmath141 , 0 and 5 .",
    "the appropriate smoothing parameters are @xmath142 so that @xmath143 .",
    "the plus signs are the best - fit model which gives the maximum @xmath140 while the asterisk signs mark the input models .",
    "the contours are @xmath144 levels from the peak , i.e. , @xmath145 of the maximum likelihood .",
    "we run 20 simulations with @xmath137 between @xmath138 and 5 and find that the standard errors are 10% for @xmath146 and 0.2 for @xmath85 .",
    "these tests show that we can recover the potential parameters from this dataset , even for extremely anisotropic dfs .",
    "figure [ fig : fig2 ] shows the input and derived energy distributions of the gcs , described by @xmath147 i.e. , the sum of the weights over all angular - momentum bins at a given energy .",
    "the derived energy distributions ( dotted lines ) fit the input distributions ( solid lines ) reasonably well for the nearly radial ( @xmath148 ) and isotropic ( @xmath149 ) dfs .",
    "however , the derived df is shifted to low energies for the nearly radial df ( @xmath141 ) , probably because the relatively large errors ( see figure [ fig : fig1 ] ) in the derived potential parameters lead to a shift of zero - energy point .",
    "nevertheless , the bimodality of the df is successfully recovered .    to determine whether our method can recover the anisotropy of the df from such a small data set",
    ", we define an indicator @xmath150 where @xmath151 is the df averaged over phase space at energy @xmath18 , @xmath152 figure [ fig : fig3 ] shows the weighted indicator of anisotropy @xmath153 which is a constant for an isotropic df .",
    "the solid lines show the input and the dotted lines show the derived anisotropy indicators associated with the best - fit models in figure [ fig : fig1 ] . for the isotropic ( @xmath149 , dotted line ) and tangential ( @xmath148 ) dfs , we recover the anisotropy correctly , but not for the radial df ( @xmath141 ) and some simulations with an isotropic df ( @xmath149 , dashed line ) .",
    "our simulations show that there is a high probability ( 5 out of 20 runs ) of failing to recover the anisotropy correctly .",
    "therefore , we can not get a reliable result for anisotropy from a small ( @xmath112160 velocities ) data set with these parameters .",
    "our simulations suggest that we can recover the dependence of the df on energy @xmath18 reasonably well with a sample of this size but we can not reliably recover the dependence of df on angular momentum @xmath19 . this is probably because the observable distribution @xmath39 depends more strongly on how gcs are distributed in energy than angular momentum . of course , with more data , we may constrain the anisotropy of the df more tightly .",
    "surveys of gc positions and radial velocities for m87 are described in section [ sec : intro ] .",
    "the largest survey of gc radial velocities is given by @xcite , who list 278 gcs .",
    "however , they are drawn from a variety of sources . to construct a uniform sample ,",
    "we use only the data in @xcite : these are drawn from a survey by @xcite , which was complete only in the radius range @xmath154@xmath155 .",
    "so we have the survey limits @xmath156 kpc ( see figure [ fig : fig4 ] ) . restricting our sample to this range , we have 161 gcs , which are shown in figure [ fig : fig5 ] .",
    "the errors in radial velocities given by @xcite range between 50100 km s@xmath15 ; we set the errors equal to 75 km s@xmath15 for all gcs .",
    "we also incorporate the surface number density profile @xmath120 , which is given with estimated error @xmath121 in 25 bins from 7 to 110 kpc by @xcite and @xcite , as an additional constraint in our calculation , as described in  [ sec : tec ] .",
    "both @xmath123 and @xmath124 should be normalized so that @xmath125 and @xmath126 are unity within the radius range 7110 kpc .",
    "notice that we do double count some of the gcs in 732 kpc since they appear in both the kinematic data @xmath17 $ ] and in the surface density distribution @xmath157 .",

    "we adopt the b - band luminosity profile in @xcite , which is smaller than the luminosity profile in @xcite by 23% , probably due to a systematic shift between different data they use .    the dotted line in figure [ fig : fig11]b shows the estimate for @xmath189 for anisotropic nfw models , which is almost the same as that for power - law models beyond 20 kpc .",
    "the errors are comparable to those for power - law models .",
    "we explore nfw models with the concentration radius @xmath5 ranging from 10 to 500 kpc .",
    "if the df is assumed isotropic , we get @xmath199 kpc , while models with @xmath200 and 500 kpc are ruled out at 2 and @xmath201 level , respectively . however , the best - fit anisotropic nfw models with 10 kpc @xmath202 kpc give @xmath203 within @xmath204 , i.e. , a wide range of @xmath5 can fit the data pretty well .",
    "the models nfw1 , nfw2 and nfw3 of @xcite are within 1-@xmath195 relative to our own best fit .",
    "the constant mass - to - light ratio model gives @xmath205 , which is much larger than the value @xmath206 obtained by @xcite fitting the globular cluster kinematics .",
    "the difference in the b - band luminosity profiles can not account for the large gap .",
    "for the same regularization level , the maximum penalized likelihood for the best - fit powerlaw and nfw models differ by less than 1-@xmath195 while the maximum for constant @xmath207 is smaller by 7 , i.e. , the constant @xmath207 model is about 4-@xmath195 worse than for the nfw or power - law models .",
    "the mass distribution of m87 from gcs has been studied by @xcite . in general our results are consistent with the conclusions of these earlier papers .",
    "our results are more robust than those by @xcite and @xcite since we assume a two - integral df rather than an isotropic df . in some aspects ,",
    "our analysis is less powerful than that of @xcite , because we do not use the stellar part to constrain the mass distribution of m87 .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that we constrain the mass distribution around the effective radius ( @xmath208 kpc ) rather poorly ( see figure [ fig : fig11 ] ) . as to the analysis of gc kinematics ,",
    "our methods and results differ from those in @xcite in the following aspects .    1",
    ".   romanowsky & kochanek ( 2001 ) fit their kinematic data to predictions for the probability distribution of radial velocities at given radii , rather than to the joint probability distribution of radius and velocity as we do .",
    "this difference in approaches is necessary because they use an incomplete sample of gcs , whereas ours is complete for @xmath209 kpc .",
    "our approach is statistically more powerful but requires us to use a subset of the gcs with measured radial velocities .",
    "2 .   we use regularization rather than entropy to smooth our results . as we have argued in ",
    "[ sec : tec ] , entropy smoothing tends to favor high - energy orbits .",
    "@xcite use entropy only as a numerical device to accelerate convergence to a final solution , eventually reducing the entropy contribution to a negligible value by reducing the constant @xmath85 in equation ( [ eq : alpha ] ) to a very small value .",
    "nevertheless , this process may still tend to bias the solution towards high - energy orbits .",
    "although @xcite explore both the best fit and the uncertainties in their mass models , they do not rigorously explore the range of dfs and velocity anisotropies that are consistent with the data .",
    "we find that either radial or tangential anisotropy in the df are allowed by the data .",
    "we also explore a wider range of mass models .",
    "the observations of metallicity of gcs show that there are metal - rich and metal - poor globular cluster samples in m87 .",
    "the metal - rich sample is more concentrated to the center @xcite .",
    "we tried to divide all gcs into two samples to study their kinematics individually .",
    "ideally it would be interesting to see how the subsamples contribute to the peaks observed in the energy distribution in figure [ fig : fig7 ] and [ fig : fig8]d .",
    "however , the present data set is too small so that the statistics is too poor to reach a conclusion .",
    "an important question is whether the mass distribution we have measured is a dark halo associated with m87 or with the virgo cluster as whole .",
    "if the df is isotropic , we find that @xmath199 kpc , which implies that the halo is small enough that it must be associated with m87 .",
    "however , for general dfs all halos with 10 @xmath210 kpc fit the data , so we can not determine whether the halo is associated with the galaxy or its host cluster .",
    "we have investigated how to determine the mass distribution of a spherical stellar system from the kinematics of a discrete set of test particles .",
    "we use a non - parametric form for the df , which includes the isotropic df as a special case , and parametrized forms for the potential , and find the best - fit potential and df using a penalized maximum likelihood method .",
    "our method allows for selection effects , observational and statistical errors , and anisotropy in the df .",
    "we find that the potential parameters are determined more securely than the energy distribution , which is in turn more accurate than the angular - momentum distribution .",
    "our simulations show that mass distributions depending on two parameters can be derived rather accurately from a small number ( @xmath211 ) of data pairs @xmath17 $ ] and surface number density profile .",
    "plausible estimates of the energy distribution of the test particles can also be recovered ; however , we can not tell whether the dfs are isotropic or not from such a small dataset .",
    "we have applied our method to a sample of 161 gcs between 7 kpc and 32 kpc in m87 . under the assumption that the system is spherical and the df is isotropic",
    ", we infer that the mass of m87 within 32 kpc is @xmath212m@xmath1 .",
    "the power - law index for the density profile , @xmath2 is @xmath171 .",
    "the energy distribution suggests a few kinematically distinct groups of globular clusters .",
    "if we allow an anisotropic df , the mass of m87 within 32 kpc is @xmath0m@xmath1 and the power - law index is @xmath194 , within 1 standard deviation of the results for an isotropic df .",
    "anisotropic models fitted to an nfw potential yield similar mass estimates but can not constrain the concentration radius @xmath5 in the range @xmath6 kpc although @xmath5 is as small as @xmath213 kpc in isotropic nfw models . assuming a constant mass - to - light ratio , the derived @xmath207 in the b - band is @xmath214 , but the model fit is substantially worse than for other mass models , and the derived mass - to - light ratio is far larger than any plausible stellar population .",
    "our methods and results are more rigorous than earlier attempts to measure the mass of m87 from gc kinematics @xcite and differ from those in @xcite as discussed in  [ sec : dis ] .    we find that our mass estimates are insensitive to the smoothing parameters .",
    "smoothing has stronger effects on the df , which is determined less reliably .",
    "the energy distribution has multiple peaks for the chosen smoothing parameters , perhaps suggesting a few kinematically distinct groups of gcs in m87 .",
    "the derived anisotropy of the gcs can not be determined at this stage . with more data",
    ", it may be possible to measure the anisotropy of the velocity distribution and to test models of gc evolution predicting that gcs on less - eccentric orbits are more likely to survive ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    a more statistically robust method of choosing smoothing parameters , more kinematic data and a more accurate surface number density , especially beyond 110 kpc are the most important theoretical and observational advances needed to determine the mass distribution in m87 more accurately by this method . for example",
    ", the ongoing acs virgo cluster survey @xcite will observe 20,000 globular clusters in the virgo cluster , which may allow us to put tighter constraints on the mass density profiles of m87 and other member galaxies .",
    "we thank judy cohen for providing the data in figures [ fig : fig4 ] and [ fig : fig5 ] in tabular form , michael strauss , david spergel , james gunn and robert lupton for valuable discussions , and the referee for suggestions that significantly improved the paper . this research was supported in part by nasa grant nng04gl47 g and used computational facilities supported by nsf grant ast-0216105 .",
