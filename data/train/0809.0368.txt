    "the relation between the local structure and its slow dynamics in a supercooled liquid near glass transition temperature , @xmath1 is currently a subject of intense curiosity .",
    "the most distinctive feature of glass formation is the rapid increase of viscosity with decrease in temperature .",
    "the temperature at which the viscosity becomes @xmath2 poise is defined as the glass transition temperature .",
    "one of the main difficulties in understanding the glass transition phenomenon is that this enormous slowing down of dynamics is apparently not accompanied by a growing static correlation length ( unlike the usual critical phenomena ) .",
    "static structural quantities do not reveal any long range correlation .",
    "in fact the static structure of the liquid near glass transition is not much different from its equilibrium high temperature counterpart .    in the adam - gibbs picture",
    "@xcite , the sharp slowing down is related to the growth of a cooperative dynamic length scale . in a separate theoretical study the size of heterogeneous reconfiguring regions in a deeply viscous liquid was inferred via the random first order transition theory ( rfot)@xcite . there is now increasing evidence from both experiments and simulations of a dynamic correlation length that grows upon approaching the glass transition @xcite .",
    "multipoint susceptibilities have been devised to quantify the behavior and magnitude of growing dynamic length scales and have been used in the experimental studies for several materials @xcite .",
    "these have directly determined the number of molecular units that move cooperatively near glass transition .",
    "the simplest density correlation function that contains information on correlated motion is the fourth - order @xcite .",
    "the four - point time - dependent density correlation function , @xmath3 measure the spatial correlations between the local liquid density at two points in space , each at two different times .",
    "the dynamical four - point susceptibility , @xmath0 ( the volume integral of @xmath3 ) becomes increasingly pronounced as glass transition is approached .    in this study , we look for a possible relationship between the structure and the slowdown of dynamics in supercooled polydisperse liquids near glass transition . in particular , we look at how the local structure ( which we characterize using structure factor and bond orientational order parameters ) would influence the growth of dynamic heterogeneity and the glass forming ability of the system .",
    "polydisperse liquids are one of the simplest model systems that exhibit glass transition and can be conveniently studied via both experiments @xcite and computer simulations as the size distribution of particles prevents crystallization @xcite .",
    "it also serves as a model for colloids and many other real world systems like polymers , pigments , paints etc as polydispersity is inherent in all these systems .",
    "polydispersity introduces a distribution of particle diameters and masses and thus makes the system intrinsically more heterogeneous .",

    "it is useful to consider only the even - l spherical harmonics , which are invariant under inversion .",
    "global bond order parameters can be calculated by averaging over all the bonds in the system , @xmath47 since @xmath48 for a given @xmath49 depends on the rotations of the reference frame , it is important to consider the rotationally invariant combinations such as @xmath50^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\ ] ] and @xmath51 @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the second and third order invariants , respectively .",

    "the exponent @xmath93 thus seems to change with polydispersity . the suppression of the rate of growth of dynamical heterogeneity by polydispersity leads to the dynamic cross - overs observed in the values of the stretch exponent , @xmath96 and the non - gaussian parameter , @xmath97 between @xmath88 and @xmath98 systems as shown earlier @xcite and the cross - over behavior seen in the exponent @xmath99 that quantifies the deviation from the prediction of stokes - einstein relation(see section iii .",
    "b ) . increasing polydispersity at fixed volume fraction",
    "decreases the fragility of the system ( see fig .",
    "[ fragility ] ) .",
    "fragility measures the rapidity with which the system approaches glass transition .",
    "hence decrease in the the rate of growth of dynamic heterogeneity with polydispersity is consistent with the decrease in the fragility .",

    "@xmath72 and @xmath77 are indices for solute and solvent , respectively . in fig .",
    "[ selog ] we show this plot for @xmath88 and @xmath89 systems .",
    "both systems show deviation from the se prediction even at high temperatures due to the intrinsic heterogeneity in the system , with the deviation being more pronounced for @xmath89 system .",
    "the se relation has been shown to be not valid for the diffusion of small solutes in a solvent of bigger particles @xcite .",
    "there is an anomalous enhancement of the self - diffusion over the se value for small solutes which can be described by a power law , @xmath110 hence the exponent @xmath99 quantifies the deviation from @xmath104 relation .",
    "it is unity in the @xmath104 limit and usually larger than unity in supercooled liquid .",
    "[ seexpo ] shows that @xmath99 deviates significantly from unity for polydisperse liquids , particularly at low temperatures .",
    "interestingly , it is larger than unity even at high temperature because of the heterogeneity in the size and mass .",
    "this deviation of the slope from unity at high temperature can be a combination of two different effects .",
    "the first one is the mass which is not present in se relation but has been reported earlier in simulations @xcite and mode coupling theory ( mct ) studies @xcite .",
    "the studies predict a weak power law mass dependence of diffusion .",
    "the second effect is that of size which has also been obtained in experiments and simulations @xcite and mct studies @xcite .",
    "when the size of one of the particles is @xmath111 times smaller than the other it shows an anomalous rise in diffusion .",
    "this enhanced diffusion has been explained in terms of microviscosity effect .",
    "the mct studies explain the microscopic origin of the size effect in terms of the difference in relaxation timescales of the two particles which leads to a decoupling in the dynamics @xcite .",
    "( note that for size dependent studies the small particle was a tracer and for mass dependent studies the heavier particle was a tracer . in the present study the systems are intrinsically heterogeneous . )    as temperature is lowered the deviation from the prediction of @xmath104 relation becomes more pronounced and one observes a crossover in the value of @xmath99 between the @xmath88 and @xmath89 systems ; the values are much higher for @xmath88 system than @xmath89 at low temperatures [ see fig .",
    "[ seexpo ] ] .",
    "this again shows that the rate of growth of dynamic heterogeneity is faster in @xmath88 system than in @xmath89 system",
    ". the faster rate of growth of dynamic correlations leads to similar temperature - dependent crossovers between @xmath88 and @xmath89 systems in the values of the stretch exponent ( @xmath96 ) and the non - gaussian parameter ( @xmath97 ) , both of which contain implicit information on dynamic heterogeneity @xcite .",
    "these studies show that there is a strong correlation between the growing dynamic heterogeneity in the system and the breakdown of @xmath104 relation as the former renders the continuum description of liquid invalid as required for the @xmath104 relation .",
    "it has been shown that the dynamics of fragile liquids are more spatially heterogeneous than that of strong liquids @xcite .",
    "increasing polydispersity at fixed volume fraction decreases the fragility of the system as shown in fig .",
    "[ fragility ] .",
    "the decrease of the rate of growth of @xmath0 with polydispersity supports the previously observed correlation between fragility and dynamic heterogeneity .",
    "the intrinsic heterogeneity of the system ( as measured by the distribution of particle masses and sizes ) increases with polydispersity .",
    "hence we have the interesting scenario in which increasing polydispersity leading to a more _ homogeneous _ dynamics even though the system becomes completely amorphous at higher values of polydispersity .",
    "it has been shown that polydispersity has a pronounced effect on potential energy surface @xcite .",
    "as polydispersity is increased from zero , the characteristics of the potential energy minima change from that of crystalline to that of amorphous .",
    "the latter is known to have low curvature and small barriers along some coordinates @xcite .",
    "this observation is also consistent from the perspective of the inherent structure formalism , according to which the potential energy landscape of a fragile liquid is very heterogeneous which in turn leads to heterogeneous dynamics whereas the landscape of strong liquids consist of a single mega basin @xcite .",
    "hence from a potential energy landscape perspective , increasing polydispersity leads to a _ smoothening _ of the landscape that in turn leads to the facilitation of dynamics as well as decrease of fragility . in section iii .",
    "d , we try to understand how polydispersity suppresses the rate of growth of dynamic correlations and in particular , whether the loss of structure upon increasing polydispersity has any role to play in this .",
    "we plot the static structure factor , @xmath112 for @xmath88 and @xmath89 systems in fig .",
    "the plot shows that increasing polydispersity destroys the local structure in the system as the system becomes more amorphous .",
    "the peak height of @xmath112 is highly suppressed in @xmath89 system as compared to @xmath88 system and does not show any appreciable growth upon lowering of @xmath113 .",
    "[ grmax ] shows the peak height value of @xmath41 , @xmath114 as a function of temperature . at @xmath88 ,",
    "the peak height shows considerable enhancement upon lowering of temperature whereas at @xmath89 there is no remarkable change in the value of @xmath114 with temperature .    as mentioned in section ii .",
    "b , the bond orientational order parameters give a better quantification of the local structural arrangement .",
    "frank @xcite proposed that atoms might form icosahedral clusters in liquids since the lowest energy state of a @xmath115-atom cluster interacting via lennard - jones potential is an icosahedron ( and not fcc ) .",
    "but icosahedra can not tile space in @xmath116-dimensions due to its @xmath117-fold symmetry and hence do not satisfy the global structural stability criterion .",
    "this geometrical frustration could be an important factor that contributes to the stability of glassy state @xcite .",
    "steinhardt et al @xcite have shown that there is a long range orientational icosahedral order in supercooled liquids .",
    "it has been shown that the large size disparities at higher values of polydispersity would inhibit any icosahedral cluster formation . however , since at low / moderate polydispersity the peak height of @xmath114 shows a pronounced growth as temperature is lowered , one can ask whether this is due to the formation of icosahedral clusters that grows with decrease in temperature .    we look for the local values of @xmath38 in order to understand whether local orientational",
    "order plays any role in the growth of dynamic heterogeneities . the icosahedral order ,",
    "if present , would be picked by the @xmath38 corresponding to @xmath62 , @xmath58 .",

    "the spherical harmonics corresponding to @xmath62 are summed over the nearest neighbor bonds only .",
    "the figure shows that there is a pronounced icosahedral orientational order at the local level .",
    "this local icosahedral order shows considerable enhancement at lower polydispersity as temperature is lowered ( for @xmath118 ) and also decreases with polydispersity .",
    "in the inset of fig . [ q6loc ]",
    "we plot @xmath58 as a function of the distance from the mct critical temperature @xmath91 which shows that as temperature is lowered , @xmath58 increases much more sharply at lower values of @xmath119 .    in fig . [ q6glob ]",
    "we plot the global values of @xmath58 for different @xmath119 as a function of temperature .",
    "the averages over bonds are evaluated by summing over all bonds lying within a sphere of radius @xmath120 units .",
    "nine such spheres are considered whose centers lie at different locations of the simulation box .",
    "we repeat this averaging for several different snapshots obtained from simulation .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ q6glob ] that polydispersity suppresses long range orientational order . even at moderate polydispersity",
    ", there is no pronounced growth of long range icosahedral order upon supercooling .",
    "our results indicate that increasing polydispersity destroys both the local structure and the local orientational order .",
    "the four - point susceptibility @xmath28 measures the susceptibility arising from the number of localized particles and is a measure of the dynamic heterogeneity in the system .",
    "thus the dynamic heterogeneity is associated with the temporary localization of particles by their neighbors .",
    "since the local structure is destroyed , at higher values of polydispersity it is not possible to have such a caging effect . as a consequence particle motion gets decorrelated over much shorter time scales",
    "this is best seen by plotting the van hove correlation function [ see fig.s [ vanhovself ] and [ vanhovdis ] ] . thus the loss of local structure due to polydispersity suppresses the growth of dynamic heterogeneity in the system .",
    "we find that the present system of @xmath121 particles of varying size and mass crystallizes when polydispersity is less than @xmath122 .",
    "thus , our system with @xmath123 polydispersity can be regarded as the system on the lower side of polydispersity that could be made to avoid crystallization and remain liquid within our md simulation time range .",
    "interestingly , we find that this is also the system that shows glassy behavior at the highest temperature . when we increase polydispersity beyond @xmath124 , we need to lower the temperature to capture the onset of slow glassy dynamics .",
    "this can be seen from fig .",
    "[ chi4max](b ) which shows that the rate of growth of @xmath102 decreases with @xmath119 .",

    "we find that the ruggedness of potential energy landscape decreases with @xmath119 , which is consistent with decrease of the @xmath125 as well as fragility with @xmath119 .",
    "it is important to note that network glass formers like silica which is a strong liquid in angell s fragile / strong classification , exhibits high glass forming ability due to trapping by defects .",

    "the latter appears to be a hallmark of polydisperse systems .",
