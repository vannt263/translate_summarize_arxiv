    "the proposed association between g11.2@xmath00.3 and the supernova ( sn ) event of 386  ad @xcite has prompted many years of detailed study of this object .",

    "downes then argued that g11.2@xmath00.3 was likely the result of either a 300 - 500 yr old type i sn explosion like tycho or kepler s supernova remnant ( snr ) , or an explosion similar to the event which produced snr cassiopeia a , but which took place in 386 ad .",
    "@xcite detected possible flat spectrum emission in the central region from high - frequency radio maps made with the _ effelsberg _ 100-m telescope , and concluded that g11.2@xmath00.3 belongs to a plerion - shell composite snr class .",

    "further _ vla _",
    "observations @xcite produced high resolution maps at 20 and 6 cm , and revealed clumpy emission at the outer shell boundry , giving it the appearance of an evolved type ii snr similar to cas a. @xcite also estimated a distance of @xmath7 kpc to the remnant based on its spectrum , and a diameter of @xmath8 pc .",
    "@xcite further supported the hypothesis linking g11.2@xmath00.3 to the historical event through correlations between radio and _ rosat _ x - ray observations , but argued for a type ia progenitor sn .",
    "hard - spectrum , non - thermal x - ray emission from a source within the remnant was detected in data from _ asca _ , which implied the existence of an embedded pulsar producing plerionic emission @xcite , and confirmed that g11.2@xmath00.3 is a composite remnant .",
    "a 65-ms x - ray pulsar ( psr j1811@xmath01925 ) was discovered by @xcite ; subsequent observations showed the characteristic spin - down age and rate of rotational kinetic energy loss to be @xmath9 yr and @xmath10 erg / s , respectively @xcite .",
    "the exact location of pulsar psr j1811@xmath01925 and the x - ray morphology of the pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) were revealed for the first time in _ chandra _ x - ray images @xcite .",
    "recent high - frequency radio observations using the single - dish _ effelsberg _ telescope revealed the spectral index of g11.2@xmath00.3 to be @xmath11 for the combined spectrum of the pwn and snr @xcite .",
    "a spectral index of @xmath12 for the shell emission alone was also calculated , by subtracting an estimated flat spectrum plerionic component .",
    "because g11.2@xmath00.3 has long been mis - classified as a purely shell radio snr , here we re - examine this source in light of its composite nature , as recently revealed by hard x - ray observations . in this paper ,",
    "we re - analyse archival _",
    "_ data of g11.2@xmath00.3 to determine its spectral index , using the technique of spectral tomography , which is a method that allows us to determine @xmath3 for both the shell and plerionic regions separately .",

    "radio observations of g11.2@xmath00.3 were made with the _ vla _ at 20 and 6 cm ( l- and c - bands , respectively ) , between 1984 april and 1985 may .",

    "the secondary calibrators 1749 + 096 , 1748@xmath0253 and 1741@xmath0038 ( b1950 ) were chosen for phase calibrations , based on observation coordinates and wavelength band . to aid in the process of detection and removal of bad visibilities",
    ", we performed calibrations on each data set individually .",
    "the header files were adjusted to match pointing centers ; this step was necessary to prompt miriad s restoring process into maintaining the smallest possible synthesized beam .",
    "combined images at both 20 and 6 cm were formed using multi - frequency synthesis and a uniform weighting scheme .",
    "the images were deconvolved using a maximum entropy algorithm @xcite .",
    "we applied iterative phase self - calibration procedures in multi - frequency mode to make additional corrections to the antenna gains as a function of time .",
    "the resulting cleaned maps , as displayed in figure  [ fig : snrs ] , were convolved with a gaussian restoring beam of dimensions @xmath13 and @xmath14 for 20 and 6 cm , respectively .      to measure the spectral index @xmath3 , where @xmath15 , from the 20- and 6-cm images , we first needed to spatially filter their @xmath16 sky distributions in order to match spatial scales @xcite .",
    "we degraded the nearly - complete @xmath16 coverage of the 20-cm image to that at 6 cm through a process of @xmath16 modelling , which essentially created a 20-cm visibility dataset with the same coverage as for the 6-cm image .",
    "this was imaged and deconvolved in the same way as were the original 6-cm data , and both maps were convolved to 10@xmath17 resolution to aid clarity in the following tomography process .",
    "we could then compare the two images in order to make a spectral index determination using the method of spectral tomography @xcite .",
    "a difference image @xmath18 was calculated by scaling the 6-cm image by a trial spectral index @xmath19 , and subtracting it from the 20-cm image , according to the formula @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 were the images being compared , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 were the average frequencies of the combined 20- and 6-cm images , respectively .",
    "when the trial spectral index reached the actual spectral index of a particular feature , i.e. @xmath25 , that region appeared to vanish into the local background of the difference image .",
    "uncertainties in @xmath3 were estimated by finding the range of @xmath19 beyond which significant residuals appeared .",
    "if a certain area of the feature possessed a slightly different spectral index , it appeared as a distinctly positive or negative residual compared to the rest of the difference image .      by examining the series of difference images , we find approximate values of @xmath3 for the pwn and snr regions of g11.2@xmath00.3 .",
    "positive residuals appear as light emission against the neutral grey background , and negative as dark emission .",
    "figure  [ fig : pwntomog ] shows a series of tomographic images between @xmath26 in @xmath27 intervals .",
    "the pwn region in the center disappears into the surrounding region within the shell when the trial spectral index is between @xmath28 0.20 and 0.30 .",
    "variations in the appearance of the shell interior between one image and the next suggest that the rms noise here roughly corresponds to a spectral index difference of @xmath29 , although we observe a very clear departure from uniform emission between 0.15 and 0.30 ; consequently , we choose asymmetric uncertainties around our best estimate of @xmath1 .    in figure  [",
    "fig : snrtomog ] , we show tomographic images between @xmath30 in @xmath31 intervals .",
    "the majority of the snr shell fades into the surrounding background between @xmath32 and @xmath33 ; we therefore estimate a value of @xmath2 for most of the shell region .",
    "however , it appears that the snr spectral index is not completely uniform , most noticeably in the southeastern region . at @xmath34 ,",
    "dark patches can be seen in the outer shell ; likewise , lingering positive residuals appear as lighter emission in the inner shell of the same region at @xmath35 .",
    "this gradient indicates that the spectrum for the outer shell is slightly flatter , and the inner shell slightly steeper , than for the bulk of the remnant .",
    "however , it should be noted that the similar size of the 6-cm beam relative to g11.2@xmath00.3 may have produced this apparent gradient if the primary beam is not perfectly modeled .",
    "observations are currently underway which will verify this feature .",
    "our measured values for @xmath36 and @xmath37 are in agreement with single - dish data as published by @xcite , who predict a fitted spectral index of @xmath38 from integrated flux density values of the total remnant . assuming a flat spectrum core of @xmath39 , they subtracted the pulsar wind component of the emission from the total , and inferred @xmath40 .",
    "this value is well within the uncertainty of our result .",
    "they also discuss shell structure , specifically , the southeastern region s appearance of being in a later evolutionary phase than the rest of the snr , based on polarization properties and x - ray observations .",
    "the possibility of a connection between their conclusion and our detected gradient in @xmath3 should perhaps be investigated further .",
    "using miriad , we determined the integrated flux over various regions in the source , and subtracted the background signal estimated from nearby sky .",
    "we estimate the background - subtracted flux density of the entire source to be @xmath41 jy at 20 cm and @xmath42 jy at 6 cm .",
    "similarly , we subtract the background interior to the shell surrounding the plerionic region to find the pwn flux density @xmath43 jy ( 20 cm ) and @xmath44 jy ( 6 cm ) .",
    "the uncertainties are inferred from the rms variations of flux in the background ; however , while the exterior background was relatively uniform in brightness , the interior background was highly irregular , causing the large uncertainties in the pwn flux .",
    "we then estimate the snr shell flux density to be @xmath45 jy ( 20 cm ) and @xmath46 jy ( 6 cm ) based on these measured results .",
    "the greatest source of systematic uncertainty in these values is a result of flux missing due to the nature of interferometric measurements having incomplete @xmath16 coverage .",
    "single - dish measurements would not be subject to the same uncertainty ; consequently , in comparing our results with those of @xcite , we estimate that @xmath7% of the total 20-cm flux and @xmath47% of 6-cm total flux is missing from our maps .",
    "we also measure the amount of missing 6-cm emission resulting from incomplete coverage by comparing the flux levels found in the 20-cm image before and after the @xmath16 modelling process .",
    "this @xmath48% difference in the total object and @xmath49% difference in the plerion indicates how much flux is lost in the 20-cm data by degrading it to 6-cm visibility , thereby implying that the 6-cm data are also missing @xmath50%@xmath51% flux .",

    "we plot an integrated fitted spectrum of the form @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the frequency in mhz . because of uncertainties in background subtraction and incomplete @xmath16 coverage ,",
    "we choose to plot an upper and a lower estimate for each value of flux density .",
    "we set @xmath43 as our low value estimate , because we used a region of high flux as background ( i.e. inside the shell ) , and also because of missing interferometric flux . by assuming the lowest possible background ( i.e. outside the shell )",
    ", we find a high value for @xmath55 , which gives a low limit estimate for @xmath56 of @xmath57 jy . in order to account for possible missing interferometric flux ,",
    "we deduce high flux estimates by subtracting our lower bounded values from interpolated total power results of @xcite .",
    "the high estimates for @xmath56 and @xmath55 are approximately @xmath58 jy and @xmath59 jy , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig : spec ] shows equation  [ equ : totflux ] plotted with our best high and low estimates of @xmath60 , and maximum and minimum uncertainties of @xmath3 .",
    "we find our values to be consistent with single - dish values , within estimated uncertainties .",
    "the higher frequency data points suggest that the true value of @xmath55 may be close to our upper estimate ; we therefore assume @xmath61 jy for our rough calculations of radio efficiency .",
    "the tomography difference images allow us to identify each feature according to its spectral index .",
    "in particular , we recognize the region of central emission that belongs to the pwn as outlined in the @xmath37 difference maps ( fig .  [",
    "fig : snrtomog ] ) by the prominent area of dark emission .",
    "a contour of this region is projected onto a detailed map of the plerionic region of g11.2@xmath00.3 in figure  [ fig : plerion ] . in this image , it is apparent that the protruding feature in the northwestern direction , and possibly a smaller , similar feature in the southeastern direction , is not spectrally part of the pwn , but may still be associated with emission from the interior of the remnant . a toroidal / jet morphology has been detected in the crab pwn , so it is possible that we may also be seeing a similar shape here . if it is a torus , then it is most likely centered very near the pulsar position , with an axis of @xmath62 west of north .",
    "there is some unexplained emission south of its eastern branch , which appears to be associated with the pwn but does not fit into the toroidal morphology , in addition to the protrusions to the nw and se , which are unassociated with the pwn .",
    "further discussion on the plerionic structure will be presented by roberts et al .",
    "( in preparation ) , as will the relationship between hard x - ray and radio emission .",
    "we measure the angular diameter of the snr to be @xmath63 at maximum extent , which corresponds to a linear diameter of @xmath64 pc , assuming the distance @xmath65 kpc to the remnant is accurate @xcite . to calculate the average diameter of the pwn , we find the total area encompassed by the plerion and approximate it as radially symmetric , resulting in an angular diameter of @xmath66 and @xmath67 pc .",
    "chandra _ x - ray image shows a pwn diameter of nearly @xmath68 @xcite , consistent with radio results .",
    "the ratio of diameters is @xmath69 in radio ; we compare this value against results for other composite remants and find it to be higher than most other reported ratios @xcite .",
    "current theory predicts two main phases of pwn evolution inside the shell . in the first phase",
    ", a bubble of plerionic gas freely expands into the supernova ejecta supersonically , until it encounters the reverse shock of the snr blast wave , which compresses the plerion . in the second phase , the pwn continues to expand within the snr at subsonic velocities , as described by a sedov solution @xcite .",
    "results of hydrodynamical numerical simulations predict the largest radial extent ratio at the point just before the reverse shock has reached the pwn ( fig .  8 of van der swaluw et al . 2000 ) .",
    "we detect a large pwn radius relative to its snr ; therefore , this object has probably not yet encountered the reverse shock .",
    "assuming these models are correct , this provides more evidence that g11.2@xmath00.3 is indeed a very young remnant , much younger than is indicated by the 24,000 yr characteristic age of the pulsar @xcite .",
    "@xcite characterize the efficiency @xmath70 of pwn radio emission by the fractional contribution of spin - down energy to radio luminosity , @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the radio luminosity of the pwn and @xmath73 is the spin - down luminosity of the associated pulsar .",
    "they establish upper limits on @xmath70 by re - examining results predicted by @xcite , with more up - to - date estimates for interstellar medium densities .",
    "six of the eight other known radio pwn are reported to have a `` typical '' efficiency of @xmath74 .",
    "using our result of @xmath75 and integrating over the range of 10 mhz to 100 ghz , we find @xmath76 thus , the efficiency of g11.2@xmath00.3 is consistent with those of other detected pwn .",
    "we have imaged snr g11.2@xmath00.3 at high resolution and revealed the spectral properties of its individual components .",
    "our spectral index and flux density results are consistent with recent studies of this source and other composite - type snr .",
    "however , measurements of its morphology suggest that it is in an earlier phase of evolution ( just entering the sedov phase ) than most other detected pwn inside remnant shells , according to numerical models .",
    "this result provides more evidence linking g11.2@xmath00.3 to the supernova event of 386  ad .",
    "we also find the radio efficiency to be as expected for an object surrounding a young , energetic pulsar .",
