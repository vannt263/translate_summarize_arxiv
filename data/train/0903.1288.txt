    "how twisted magnetic fields emerge from the dense , convectively unstable solar convection zone into the stably stratified , rarefied solar atmosphere and corona is a fundamentally important question for understanding the formation of solar active regions and the development of precursor structures for solar eruptions such as flares and cmes .",
    "pioneered by the earlier work of shibata and collaborators @xcite , a large body of 3d mhd simulations of the emergence of twisted magnetic flux tubes into the solar atmosphere ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) have been carried out in recent years , which have provided important insight into the above dynamic process .",
    "it has been shown that magnetic flux reaching the photosphere can undergo a dynamic expansion into the atmosphere as a result of the non - linear growth of the magnetic buoyancy instability . the conditions required of the emergent tubes for the onset of such dynamic expansion into the atmosphere has been examined by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these simulations have also shown that it is difficult for a twisted flux tube to rise bodily into the corona as a whole due to the heavy plasma that is trapped at the bottom concave ( or u - shaped ) portions of the winding field lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while the upper parts of the helical field lines of the twisted flux tube expand into the atmosphere and the corona , the u - shaped parts of the winding field lines remain largely trapped at and below the photosphere layer , and the center of the original tube axis ceases to rise a couple of pressure scale heights above the photosphere . despite this , a twisted coronal flux rope with sigmoid - shaped concave upturning field lines threading under a central axis that rises into coronal heights",
    "is found to develop in the end in many simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite found that shear flows on the photosphere driven by the magnetic tension force continually transport axial flux and magnetic energy to the upper expanded portion of the emerged field , causing it to eventually `` pinch off '' from the lower mass - laden part via magnetic reconnection in a current sheet forming in the lower atmosphere .",
    "this reconnection produces a coronal flux rope with a new central axial field line that rises into the corona with increasing speed .",
    "such development of a coronal flux rope is found to take place more readily with a more sharply arched subsurface tube for which the emerging segment breaking through the photosphere contains fewer turns of field line twist .",
    "@xcite shows that during the emergence of a twisted flux tube , both the vertical emergence of magnetic flux and the horizontal motions at the footpoints of the emerged field lines inject magnetic energy and helicity ( or twist ) into the atmosphere .",
    "the contribution by the direct emergence dominates at the early phase of flux emergence , while the horizontal flows become a dominant contributor of helicity injection later .",
    "@xcite studied in more detail the horizontal flows on the photosphere during flux emergence and found that as soon as the flux tubes intersecting the photosphere become vertical and the two polarity flux concentrations on the photosphere become separated , a rotational flow appears in each of the polarity flux concentrations .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study further the role of the shear flows and the rotational flows in driving the formation of a coronal flux rope during flux emergence .",
    "we present a simulation of the emergence of a twisted @xmath0-shaped subsurface flux tube whose emerging segment initially breaking through the photosphere contains less than one full wind of field - line twist . as in the simulation of @xcite",
    ", we find a brief initial phase of flux emergence during which the two polarity flux concentrations on the photosphere undergo a shearing motion along the neutral line and become separated .",
    "then a prominent rotational / vortical motion develops within each polarity , reminiscent of sunspot rotations that have been observed occasionally ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the rotational motions of the two polarities are due to torsional alfvn waves propagating along the twisted flux tube , transporting magnetic twist from the tube s interior portion , where the rate of twist is high , to its greatly stretched coronal portion , where the rate of twist is low , a result that was predicted by an earlier idealized analytical model of @xcite .",
    "the rotational motions of the two polarities are found to persist throughout the later phase of the evolution and steadily inject magnetic helicity into the atmosphere .",
    "the combined effect of the initial shear flow and the subsequent rotational motions of the two polarities is to twist up the inner field lines of the emerged field , causing them to rotate from their initial normal configuration ( i.e. arching over the polarity inversion line from the positive to the negative polarity ) , into an inverse configuration ( directed from the negative polarity to the positive polarity over the neutral line ) . in this manner ,",
    "a flux rope with sigmoid - shaped dipped core fields forms in the atmosphere , with the center of the flux rope , as represented by the o - point of the transverse field in the central cross - section , rising into coronal heights .",
    "this field reconfiguration is a major new finding of our study , namely that the horizontal rotation of the field direction of the lower emerged flux into an inverse configuration causes an upward propagation of the o - point , and initiates the development of the coronal flux rope .",
    "similar to many previous simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a current sheet forms in the lower atmosphere , and the field lines whose lower parts going through the current sheet all display a sigmoid morphology , which may correspond to the observed x - ray sigmoid loops in active regions .",
    "the remainder of the paper is structured as follows . in  2 we describe the numerical mhd model and the detailed setup of the simulation . in  3 , we describe the simulation results , with focuses on examining the nature of the rotational motion of the two polarities on the photosphere and how it drives the formation of a flux rope in the corona .",
    "finally in  4 we summarize the conclusions and discuss the implications of our simulation results .",
    "in this study we solve numerically the following ideal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations in a cartesian domain : @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 + \\rho { \\bf v } \\cdot { \\bf g } , \\label{eqetot}\\ ] ] @xmath6 where @xmath7 @xmath8 in the above @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 denote respectively the velocity field , the magnetic field , density , pressure , temperature , the gas constant , the mean molecular weight , the internal energy per unit volume , and the total energy ( internal+kinetic+magnetic ) per unit volume . the gravitational acceleration @xmath18 is a constant and is directed in the @xmath19 direction .",
    "the above ideal mhd equations are solved numerically without any _ explicit _ viscosity , magnetic diffusion , and non - adiabatic effects , although numerical dissipations are present .",
    "thus we do not physically treat the radiative energy transfer , thermal conduction , coronal heating , and the effects of partial ionization , which all play important roles in the thermal energy evolution of the plasma in the solar atmosphere .",
    "the thermal properties of the plasma in our simulations are therefore unrealistic .",
    "our study here focuses on the dynamic and topological properties of the 3d emerging magnetic field , given the above simplifications .",
    "the basic numerical schemes we use to solve the above mhd equations are as follows .",
    "the equations are discretized in space using a staggered finite - difference scheme @xcite , and advanced in time with an explicit , second order accurate , two - step predictor - corrector time stepping .",
    "a modified , second order accurate lax - friedrichs scheme similar to that described in is applied for evaluating the fluxes in the continuity , momentum , and energy equations .",
    "compared to the standard second order lax - friedrichs scheme , this scheme significantly reduces numerical diffusivity for regions of smooth variation , while retaining the same robustness in regions of shocks .",
    "a method of characteristics that is upwind in the alfvn waves @xcite is used for evaluating the @xmath20 term in the induction equation , and the constrained transport scheme is used to ensure @xmath21 to machine round - off errors .",
    "the equations are non - dimensionalized using the following normalizing constants : @xmath22 g @xmath23 ( photospheric density ) , @xmath24 km ( pressure scale height at the photosphere ) , @xmath25 k ( photospheric temperature ) , @xmath26 km  @xmath27 ( isothermal sound speed at the photosphere ) , @xmath28 s , @xmath29 ( photospheric pressure ) and @xmath30 g , as the units for density , length , temperature , velocity , time , pressure , and magnetic field respectively . for the remainder of the paper ,",
    "quantities and equations are expressed in the above units unless otherwise specified .",
    "the setup of the numerical simulation is illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "the simulation domain ( top panel of figure 1 ) is @xmath31 , resolved by a @xmath32 grid . in the @xmath33-direction ( @xmath34-direction ) , the mesh size is @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) within @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , and it increases gradually for @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) , reaching about 2 at the boundaries . in the @xmath41-direction ,",
    "the mesh size is @xmath42 within the range @xmath43 , and for @xmath44 it increases gradually to 1.39 at the top boundary .",
    "the horizontal boundaries in the @xmath33-direction ( the direction of the initial flux tube ) are assumed to be periodic .",
    "the bottom boundary is a perfectly conducting wall and is non - penetrating .",
    "an outflow boundary condition ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is applied for the top boundary and the two horizontal boundaries in the @xmath34-direction . for the initial state",
    ", we consider a plane - parallel atmosphere in hydrostatic equilibrium , composed of an adiabatically stratified polytropic layer representing the top layer of the convection zone , an isothermal layer representing the photosphere and the chromosphere , connecting to another isothermal layer of 1 mk representing the corona .",
    "the vertical profiles of the pressure @xmath45 , density @xmath46 , and temperature @xmath47 of the hydrostatic field - free atmosphere are shown in the bottom panel of figure 1 . a horizontal",
    ", twisted magnetic flux tube oriented along the @xmath33-direction is embedded in the polytropic layer ( convection zone ) with its axis located at @xmath48 .",
    "the magnetic field of the flux tube is given by @xmath49 where @xmath50 @xmath51 in the above @xmath52 is the tube axial direction , @xmath53 is the azimuthal direction in the tube cross - section , and @xmath54 denotes the radial distance to the tube axis .",
    "the flux tube is uniformly twisted , with the constant @xmath55 denoting the angle of field line rotation about the axis over a unit length of the tube .",
    "we set @xmath56 , the radius @xmath57 , and the rate of twist @xmath58 ( left - handed ) , which makes the tube marginally stable for the kink instability @xcite .",
    "the profile of the magnetic pressure @xmath59 along the vertical line at @xmath60 through the center of the embedded tube is also shown in figure 1 . inside the flux tube ,",
    "the plasma pressure differs from that of the hydrostatic field - free atmosphere @xmath45 by : @xmath61 , \\label{p1}\\ ] ] satisfying the equation : @xmath62 which ensures that the pressure gradient in the flux tube balances the lorentz force . to make the flux tube buoyant",
    ", we further impose a density change @xmath63 within the flux tube relative to @xmath64 of the field - free hydrostatic atmosphere : @xmath65\\ ] ] where @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "this makes the middle portion of the flux tube buoyant , with @xmath68 at the middle of the tube axis .",
    "the buoyancy declines with @xmath69 from @xmath70 following a gaussian profile with an e - folding length of @xmath71 , and the two ends are slightly anti - buoyant with @xmath72 at the ends of the tube axis .",
    "the plasma @xmath73 ( defined as the ratio of the plasma pressure over the magnetic pressure ) is about @xmath74 at the axis of the tube .",
    "the early evolution of the buoyant flux tube is qualitatively similar to those reported in many previous investigations .",
    "the central portion of the initial flux tube rises buoyantly while the two ends of the flux tube sink down towards the bottom owing to the slight negative buoyancy there .",
    "the flux tube develops into an @xmath0-shape , whose central apex portion rises towards the photosphere .",
    "when the flux tube enters the stably stratified photosphere , magnetic pressure builds up at the photosphere layer and the magnetic buoyancy instability develops .",
    "this causes a rapid expansion of the front of the flux tube into the solar atmosphere and initiates the flux emergence .",
    "figures 2 and 3 show respectively two perspective views of the 3d magnetic field as delineated by a set of representative field lines at 4 time instances during the flux emergence into the solar atmosphere .",
    "we see that at @xmath75 , the apex of the flux tube has broken through the photosphere and the front of the emerging flux tube begins to expand rapidly into the atmosphere and corona . with time",
    ", a twisted flux rope structure with field lines winding about a central axis ( as represented by the black line ) is formed in the atmosphere ( see the @xmath76 and @xmath77 panels ) . by time @xmath77",
    ", the central axis of the flux rope structure has reached coronal heights , and sigmoid - shaped field lines ( see the orange and red field lines ) , some of which containing dips , thread under the central axis with an inverse configuration ( i.e. pointing from negative to positive polarity region over the neutral line ) .",
    "note that field lines in different images are not the same field lines carrying the same plasma .",
    "they are simply field lines selectively drawn in each instance to reflect the topological structure of the 3d field .",
    "for example , the black axis in each panel corresponds to a _",
    "different _ field line in each of the time instances , an important point to be addressed later in  3.2 .    figures 4(a)(b ) show the evolution of the height and rise velocity for 3 different points within the central vertical plane of @xmath70 : ( 1 ) the front of the emerging flux tube , ( 2 ) the lagrangian position of the original tube axis , and ( 3 ) the o - point of the transverse magnetic field in the central vertical plane at @xmath70 , which is the point where @xmath78 on the central vertical line of @xmath70 and @xmath79 . figure 5 shows an example snapshot of the central vertical plane of @xmath70 at time @xmath80 , where the arrows show the direction of the transverse magnetic field in the plane , overlaid with a color image showing density on a log scale .",
    "note , only the part above the photosphere is shown , and the arrow lengths are all the same , normalized by the transverse field strength , for the points where the transverse field strengths are non - zero .",
    "the o - point of the transverse magnetic field is marked by the pink ` * ' point , and it has reached the height of the base of the corona at @xmath80 . it should be emphasized that the o - point position is based on a geometric definition which depends on the variation of @xmath81 with @xmath41 along the central vertical line of @xmath70 and @xmath79 .",
    "thus it does not track a lagrangian plasma element , and its height variation with time _ does not in general reflect the true vertical plasma motion _ but is strongly influenced by the change with time of the horizontal magnetic field orientations at points along the central vertical line . for these reasons , @xmath82 of @xmath83 for the o - point position shown in figure 4(a ) , does not in general agree with @xmath84 , the vertical velocity of the plasma instantaneously residing at the o - point shown in figure 4(b ) ( dashed - line ) .",
    "we also note that the black field line shown in each of the panels in figure 2 and 3 is the field line that is drawn from the o - point at that instance , and it corresponds to a different field line in each time .    from the position and the rise velocity of the front of the flux tube as shown in figure 4",
    ", one can see that the onset of the magnetic buoyancy instability and flux emergence into the atmosphere takes place at about @xmath85 , at which time there is an exponential increase of the vertical speed of the front . @xcite and @xcite have , based on the original work of @xcite and @xcite , given the following critical condition for the onset of magnetic buoyancy instability and flux emergence at the photospheric layer : @xmath86 where @xmath41 is height , @xmath87 is the local pressure scale height at the photosphere , @xmath88 is the magnetic field strength , @xmath89 is the ratio of the specific heats , @xmath73 is the ratio of the plasma pressure over the magnetic pressure , @xmath90 is the superadiabaticity of the atmosphere , which is @xmath91 for the isothermal stratification of the photosphere , and @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the three components of the local perturbation wave vector ( normalized by @xmath95 ) , with @xmath92 and @xmath93 being the two horizontal components parallel and perpendicular to the local magnetic field direction , and @xmath94 being the @xmath41 component .",
    "we find that at @xmath85 the build - up of magnetic pressure at the photosphere layer has just exceeded the gas pressure , forming a layer of low plasma @xmath73 ( see top panel of figure 6 ) , where the strong stabilizing term @xmath96 is reduced to become smaller than @xmath97 ( see bottom panel of figure 6 ) .",
    "using the horizontal widths @xmath98 and @xmath99 of the emerging magnetic region at @xmath100 to estimate @xmath101 and @xmath102 , and @xmath103 tube radius , we find that the above critical condition is met at @xmath104 .    as the front of the emerging flux tube begins to expand into the atmosphere at about @xmath85 , the rise speed of the original tube axis ( solid curve in figure 4(b ) ) and the rise speed measured at the location of the o - point ( dashed curve in figure 4(b ) ) both begin to decline , and their positions remain below @xmath105 during the period from @xmath75 to @xmath106 ( see figure 4(a ) ) .",
    "however , soon after @xmath106 there is an upward jump of the o - point position , and then its height continues to increase sharply . with the o - point moving into coronal heights , a flux rope with dipped , sigmoid - shaped core field ( see the @xmath77 panels in figures 2 and 3 ) develops in the corona .      to understand the apparent rise of the o - point into coronal heights and the formation of the coronal flux rope , we have tracked the evolution of a set of field lines which intersect the center vertical line of the domain ( at @xmath70 and @xmath79 ) .",
    "the way we do this is by tracking the motion of a few lagrangian points situated along the center vertical line of symmetry at @xmath70 and @xmath79 , and trace out field lines through these points at successive time instances from @xmath75 to @xmath77 .",
    "figures 7 , 8 , and 9 show 3d evolution of these tracked field lines as viewed from 3 perspectives .",
    "the black field line here corresponds to the original tube axis , and all the other field lines have their mid points ( at @xmath70 , @xmath79 ) above the mid point of the black field line ( reddish field lines have mid points above bluish field lines ) .",
    "note that the apex of the red field line does not correspond to the emerging front , but is significantly below it .",
    "thus its position and rise speed do not correspond to the dash - dotted lines for the front of the emerging tube shown in figure 4 . in this sequence of images , a field line of a particular color",
    "corresponds to the same field line carrying the same plasma .",
    "a corresponding animated gif movie showing the evolution of the tracked field lines is also available from the electronic edition .    at the beginning of the flux emergence",
    "( see the @xmath75 image in figure 8) , the field lines all show a normal configuration , i.e. they arch over the polarity inversion line from the positive to the negative polarity region .",
    "the @xmath81 components of these field lines at the midpoints are all positive .",
    "thus at this time , the o - point , which is the point of zero @xmath81 on the central vertical line , is located below the black field line ( the original tube axis ) . with time",
    "the two polarity regions on the photosphere begin to show a significant shearing motion along the neutral line ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the two polarity regions begin to separate . as a result",
    "the lower - lying black ( original axial field line ) and dark blue field lines are lengthened and begin to rotate ( clockwise ) toward an inverse configuration , with their @xmath81 changing from positive to negative at the midpoints ( see figure 8) . by time",
    "@xmath107 ( see figure 8) , the black and dark blue field lines have rotated to show a slight negative @xmath81 at their mid points , while the upper yellow and red field lines are still having positive @xmath81 at their midpoints .",
    "this change of orientations of the lower ( black and dark blue ) field lines from positive @xmath81 to negative @xmath81 causes an abrupt upward shift of the zero point of @xmath81 along the center vertical line of @xmath70 and @xmath79 , i.e. an upward shift of the o - point seen in figure 4(a ) ( soon after @xmath108 ) . as a result the o - point position shifts from below to above the original tube axis ( the black field line in figures 7,8 and 9 ) .",
    "this apparent crossing of the o - point position from below to above the original tube axis ( as seen between @xmath108 and @xmath107 in figure 4a ) is not a true plasma rise motion , but is simply due to the change of horizontal field line orientations in the atmosphere : the original tube axis ( the black field line tracked in figure 8) rotates from a forward into an inverse configuration , with @xmath81 at its mid point changing from positive to negative , and as a result the zero point of @xmath81 on the center vertical line of @xmath70 and @xmath79 , namely the o - point , propagates upward in position to a _ different _ field line above , which is now aligned with the @xmath33 direction .    by time of about @xmath107 ,",
    "a significant counter - clockwise vortical or rotational motion has set in within each of the two polarity flux concentrations on the photosphere , reminiscent of sunspot rotations ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the vortical motions can be seen from the footpoint motions of the field lines in figures 7,8 , and 9 ( and in the movie ) , and more clearly in figure 10 which shows snapshots of the @xmath41 component of the vorticity @xmath109 on the photosphere overlaid with contours of @xmath110 .",
    "we find high intensity of positive @xmath109 ( corresponding to counter - clockwise vortical motion ) centered on the peaks of the vertical magnetic flux concentration of both polarities .",
    "figure 11 shows the evolution of the mean vertical vorticity @xmath111 averaged over the area of each polarity flux concentration where @xmath110 is above 75% of the peak @xmath110 value .",
    "we find that the counter - clockwise vortical motion centered on each polarity flux concentration , as represented by @xmath112 , rises to its peak rate at @xmath113 and then persists at a relatively steady rate throughout the subsequent evolution .",
    "the footpoint vortical motions further twist up the emerged field lines , causing continued clock - wise horizontal rotation of the blue and the higher yellow and red field lines in the atmosphere as viewed from the top ( see the @xmath76 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath77 panels in figure 8 and the movie ) . with time , the yellow and then red field lines are also progressively rotated into an inverse configuration , changing the sign of @xmath81 from positive to negative at their mid points .",
    "this causes the o - point position ( the zero @xmath81 position on the center line of @xmath70 , @xmath79 ) to continue to propagate upward as seen in figure 4(a ) after about @xmath107 .",
    "note again that this upward shift of the o - point position from @xmath106 to about @xmath116 is not due to a true vertical rise of the plasma as can be seen from the near zero @xmath84 during this period shown in figure 4(b ) , but is simply a propagation effect produced by the change of horizontal orientations of the emerged field lines .",
    "starting from about @xmath116 , the plasma rise velocity @xmath84 measured at the o - point position also shows a significant upward acceleration ( see figure 4(b ) ) , which means that the rapid ascent of the o - point after about @xmath116 ( see figure 4(a ) ) is a combination of the upward propagation produced by the change of the horizontal orientations of the field lines and an actual rise motion of the field lines . at about @xmath115 ( see figure 8) , the o - point position has reached @xmath117 , which is at this instant identified with the mid - point of the red field line .",
    "the red field line has rotated to become aligned with the @xmath33-direction with zero @xmath81 at the middle and is at this instant identified as the axial field line of the coronal flux rope .",
    "the plasma rise speed @xmath84 measured at the o - point is about @xmath118 ( or 16.9 km / s ) , which continues to increase ( see figure 4(b ) ) .",
    "the field lines continue to rotate horizontally . as a result",
    "the field line identified as the coronal axial field line is continually changing . by time @xmath77",
    ", the red field line has further rotated to having a negative @xmath81 at its center , and the o - point has now shifted to a field line ( not shown in figures 7 , 8 , and 9 ) above the red field line .",
    "we also find that in conjunction with the horizontal rotation of the black and blue field lines in the atmosphere due to shearing and twisting at their footpoints , they develop central dips , into which plasma drains , and the two side `` wings '' of each of these field lines rise rapidly into the corona ( see the @xmath76 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath77 images in figures 7 and 9 ) .",
    "the above examination of the tracked field lines indicate that the formation and rise of the coronal flux rope is not a result of the bodily emergence of the subsurface flux tube as a whole .",
    "the bottom concave portions of the helical field lines in the original emerging flux tube breaking through the surface remain largely trapped at and below the photosphere layer due to the weight of the heavy plasma , and the center of the original tube axis ceases to rise after reaching about 2 - 3 pressure scale heights above the photosphere .",
    "however , the shearing and vortical motions of the two polarity flux concentrations at the photosphere continue to transport twist and magnetic energy into the emerged field in the atmosphere ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our analysis in this paper shows that due to this vortical motion at the footpoints , the emerged field lines near and just above the original axial field line ( including the original axial field line itself ) rotate horizontally in the atmosphere , changing @xmath81 at their mid points from positive to negative ( i.e. from an original normal configuration to an inverse configuration with respect to the photosphere neutral line ) .",
    "this initiates an upward _ propagation _ of the o - point in the emerged field in the central @xmath70 cross - section simply because of the change of horizontal orientation of the inner field lines , and not because of the rise of these field lines .",
    "later , the plasma rise speed measured at the o - point also shows a sharp increase , contributing to the rapid ascent of the o - point into coronal heights . as a result ,",
    "a coronal flux rope with an axis identified with the field line instantaneously aligned with the @xmath33-direction at its mid point ( i.e. going through the o - point ) , and with sigmoid shaped field lines threading under the axis with an inverse configuration develops , and it is rising with increasing velocity as the vortical motions at the footpoints of the flux rope continue to transport magnetic energy and twist into the corona . note that the field line being identified as the axial field line of the coronal flux rope is continually changing , due to the continued horizontal rotation of the field lines in the atmosphere as their footpoints are being twisted .    to quantify the transport of twist into the solar atmosphere due to both flux emergence as well as the horizontal vortical motions at the photosphere , we have computed the evolution of the relative magnetic helicity in the atmosphere above the photosphere and the helicity flux through the photospheric boundary .",
    "the relative magnetic helicity in the atmosphere above the photosphere @xmath119 is defined as @xcite : @xmath120 where @xmath10 is the magnetic field in the unbounded half space above @xmath119 , @xmath121 is the vector potential for @xmath10 , @xmath122 is the reference potential field having the same normal flux distribution as @xmath10 on the @xmath119 boundary , and @xmath123 is the vector potential for @xmath122 .",
    "the relative magnetic helicity @xmath124 is invariant with respect to the gauges for @xmath121 and @xmath123 .",
    "following @xcite , we use the following specific @xmath121 and @xmath123 for computing @xmath124 : @xmath125 @xmath126 where , @xmath127^{1/2 } } \\ ; dx ' dy ' . \\label{phi}\\ ] ] if we use the specific @xmath121 and @xmath123 given in equations ( [ a ] ) through ( [ phi ] ) , it can be shown that the expression ( [ hm ] ) for the relative helicity @xmath124 reduces to simply @xmath128 note , the derivation of the relative magnetic helicity assumed unbounded half space above the photosphere @xcite .",
    "we carry out the above integral within the simulation domain above @xmath119 assuming that the field outside of the domain is zero .",
    "thus , our helicity integration only gives an accurate result before the emerged field has expanded to reach the top and side boundaries .",
    "it has also been shown @xcite that the rate of change of the relative helicity @xmath124 can alternatively be computed by evaluating the helicity flux through the @xmath119 boundary plane : @xmath129 \\cdot { \\hat { \\bf z } } \\ ; dx dy \\label{hmflux}\\ ] ] where @xmath123 is given by equations ( [ ap])-([phi ] ) .",
    "the first term on the right - hand - side of equation ( [ hmflux ] ) corresponds to the injection of helicity by horizontal motion on the boundary , and the second term corresponds to injection by direct emergence or submergence of twisted flux across the boundary .",
    "note again , we carry out the above integration on the @xmath119 plane within the domain , assuming zero flux through the @xmath119 plane outside of the domain .",
    "the resulting evolution of @xmath130 and @xmath124 for the emerged field above @xmath119 is shown in figure 12 . in the lower panel of figure 12 , both @xmath124 computed from equation ( [ hm ] ) ( solid line ) and that obtained by accumulation of helicity flux with time @xmath131 ( dash - dotted line ) are shown .",
    "the good agreement of the two indicates good helicity conservation from our simulation . the deviation in the end is due to the fact that twisted magnetic flux is exiting the top and side boundaries and is therefore not accounted for in the integration of equation [ hm ] , while the time integration of @xmath132 continues to give accurately the amount of helicity that has been transported into the atmosphere through the boundary at @xmath119 .",
    "the top panel of figure 12 shows that the helicity flux due to flux emergence is dominating for a brief period at the beginning ( from about @xmath133 to @xmath134 ) , and then after about @xmath134 , horizontal shearing and rotational motions at the footpoints of the emerged field become the main source of helicity flux . by time of about @xmath107 ,",
    "the rotational motions in the two polarity flux concentrations have been established ( see figure 11 ) and they provide a steady and dominant helicity flux into the atmosphere in the subsequent evolution ( top panel of figure 12 ) . by time",
    "@xmath77 , the helicity transported into the atmosphere has reached about @xmath135 , corresponding to one full twist ( @xmath136 rotation ) of the flux @xmath137 in the original flux tube .",
    "the rotational motions centered on the two polarity flux concentrations are a manifestation of non - linear torsional alfvn waves propagating along the flux tube , transporting twist from the tube s interior portion towards its expanded coronal portion .",
    "consider the quantity @xmath138 , which gives a measure of the local rate of twist of the magnetic field .",
    "for a force - free magnetic field : @xmath139 from which one can show that @xmath140 i.e. @xmath141 is constant along each field line for a field with zero lorentz force . if there is a gradient of @xmath141 along a field line , then the _ thin _ flux bundle ( or tube ) centered on the field line will experience a net axial torque which drives torsional motion of the flux tube @xcite .",
    "the net axial torque exerted on a thin flux tube segment @xmath142 , where @xmath143 denotes the arc length along the thin tube , is given by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* eq . ( 20 ) in that paper ) : @xmath144 where @xmath145 represents a torque along the axial direction @xmath146 , which will drive the tube segment to spin about its axis , @xmath147 denotes the radius of the tube , @xmath148 denotes the axial field strength .",
    "equation ( [ tft_torque ] ) states that the net axial torque @xmath145 for a thin flux tube segment is directly proportional to the gradient of @xmath141 along the tube .",
    "note that in @xcite , the quantity @xmath55 , defined as the angle of field line rotation about the central axis per unit length along the tube , is used in place of @xmath141 to describe the twist . for a thin flux tube , the relation between @xmath141 and @xmath55 is @xmath149 @xcite .",
    "figure 13 shows the variation of @xmath141 along three field lines : the black field line shown in figures 7 , 8 , and 9 , corresponding to the original tube axis , and its two neighboring blue field lines shown in figures 7 , 8 , and 9 , at @xmath115 .",
    "we have plotted the @xmath141 values along these three field lines ( using the same colors for the data points as those of the corresponding field lines in figures 7 , 8 , and 9 ) as a function of depth , from their left ends to the left apices in the atmosphere , at @xmath115 .",
    "we can see that for all three neighboring field lines , the magnitude of @xmath141 decreases with height from the interior into the atmosphere .",
    "the @xmath141 is nearly constant along the atmosphere / corona portions of the field lines , indicating that they are near a force - free state , and the coronal value is about a factor of 10 less than the peak magnitude of @xmath141 in the interior part of the flux tube .",
    "the low @xmath141 magnitude in the corona is due to the extreme expansion and stretching of the magnetic field lines resulting from flux emergence @xcite .",
    "the lowered magnitude of @xmath141 in the atmosphere establishes a gradient of @xmath141 along the flux tube from the interior to the atmosphere , and produces a torque that drives the observed torsional motion of the flux tube intersecting the photosphere .",
    "the torsional motion will continue until the gradient of @xmath141 along the tube is removed , and the coronal @xmath141 equilibrates with the interior @xmath141 @xcite .",
    "the final 3d magnetic field in the atmosphere and corona obtained from the simulation show a coronal flux rope structure whose properties may qualitatively explain some basic observed features of sigmoid active regions .",
    "similar to what was found in @xcite , a current sheet has formed in the lower atmosphere .",
    "the top panel of figure 14 shows the current density @xmath150 in a horizontal plane at height @xmath151 in the chromosphere .",
    "it shows a horizontal cross - section of the current sheet .",
    "the current sheet has an over - all inverse - s shape ( except the central zigzag ) .",
    "field lines traced through a few points along the current concentration on @xmath151 are also plotted ( for different perspectives ) in the two lower panels of figure 14 .",
    "we find that all the field lines going through the current sheet show an inverse - s shape when viewed from the top ( as illustrated in the lower right panel of figure 14 ) , similar to what has been found in the simulations of @xcite and consistent with the theoretical prediction of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "one can argue that the heating associated with the current sheet may cause these inverse - s shaped field lines to preferentially brighten up in soft x - ray , giving rise to the observed x - ray sigmoid loops in an active region .",
    "it can also be seen that some of the field lines undergo sharp dips at the center portion of the current sheet ( see the red field lines in the lower left panel of figure 14 ) .",
    "reconnections in the current sheet are disengaging the heavy mass trapped in the dips , allowing for the flux rope to rise further into the corona with increasing speed .",
    "we find that the inverse - s shaped current sheet begins to develop at the time of about @xmath116 , being initially confined to a few pressure scale - heights above the photosphere . with time the current sheet extends upward , and",
    "by time @xmath77 , it has extended to the base of the corona .",
    "growing reconnections in the current sheet due to the numerical diffusion inherent in the code are expected to aid the upward acceleration of the center of the flux rope seen after about @xmath116 ( figure 4b ) .",
    "however , the ultimate driver of the rise of the flux rope and the development of the current sheet is the continued vortical motions at the footpoints of the emerged field lines , which transport twist and magnetic energy into the atmosphere , causing an excess of the upward lorentz force that drives the acceleration .",
    "we have presented a 3d mhd simulation of the emergence of a twisted @xmath0-shaped flux tube from the top layer of the solar interior into the solar atmosphere and the corona . compared to some of the previous simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the subsurface rising flux tube is more sharply arched such that the emerging segment first breaking through the photosphere contains less than one full wind of twist . in this simulation , we find that after an initial stage of flux emergence , during which the two polarity flux concentrations on the photosphere undergo a shearing motion and become separated , a prominent rotational / vortical motion develops within each polarity , reminiscent of sunspot rotations .",
    "this rotational motion persists throughout the subsequent evolution and steadily transports twist or magnetic helicity into the atmosphere .",
    "similar to what has been found in many previous investigations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the twisted flux tube is unable to rise bodily into the corona as a whole . while the upper parts of the winding field lines of the twisted flux tube expand into the atmosphere and the corona , the center of the original axial field line of the tube ceases to rise at about 2 - 3 pressure scale heights above the photosphere and the u - shaped parts of the helical field lines largely remain anchored at and below the photospheric layer .",
    "however , we find that the initial shearing and the subsequent rotational motions of the two polarity flux concentrations twist up the inner field lines ( near and include the original tube axis ) of the emerged field , causing them to rotate in the atmosphere from their initial normal configuration ( having a positive @xmath81 at the mid point , or arching over the polarity inversion line from the positive to the negative polarity ) , into an inverse configuration ( having a negative @xmath81 at the mid point , directed from the negative polarity to the positive polarity over the neutral line ) .",
    "this change of the horizontal orientations of the emerged field lines causes an upward propagation of the o - point ( the zero - crossing point of @xmath81 along the center vertical line of @xmath70 and @xmath79 ) in the emerged field in the central vertical cross - section ( @xmath70 ) . with the continued twisting of the emerged field lines by the vortical motions at the footpoints , which transports twist and magnetic energy into the corona ,",
    "the actual plasma motion measured at the o - point also starts to accelerate upwards .",
    "thus , the rapid ascent of the o - point is a combination of the upward propagation produced by the change of the horizontal orientations of the field lines and the actual rise of the field lines . as a result , a coronal flux rope with an axial field line identified with the field line instantaneously aligned with the @xmath33-direction at its mid point ( i.e. going through the o - point ) , and with sigmoid shaped field lines threading under the axis with an inverse configuration , is formed and rises with increasing speed as the vortical motions at the footpoints continue",
    "some of the sigmoid shaped field lines threading under the axis have also develop sharp dips as they are being twisted at the footpoints , with plasma draining into the dips and with the two side lobes rising rapidly into the corona .",
    "a current sheet forms in the lower atmosphere with field lines going through it all showing sigmoid shapes .",
    "heating in the current sheet may therefore cause these field lines to brighten up in x - ray as the observed sigmoid loops in active regions .",
    "field lines going through the center portion of the current sheet undergo sharp dips .",
    "reconnections in the current sheet allow for removal of the heavy plasma trapped in the dips and hence enhance the upward acceleration of the coronal flux rope .",
    "the formation of a coronal flux rope with sigmoid shaped core fields and with a current sheet in the lower atmosphere as a result of the emergence of a twisted flux tube from the interior into the solar atmosphere has been found to be a very general result ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the onset of a rotational / vortical motion centered on the two polarity flux concentrations soon after they become separated has also been found in @xcite .",
    "our work explicitly demonstrates how the vortical motions of the footpoints twist up the inner emerged field lines and rotate them into an inverse configuration ( figures 7 , 8 , and 9 ) , leading to the development and upward ascent of the coronal flux rope structure .",
    "we also show that the rotational motions of the two polarity flux concentrations on the photosphere are a manifestation of nonlinear torsional alfvn waves propagating along the flux tube , consistent with what has been predicted by an idealized analytical model of @xcite . due to the rapid stretching of the emerged magnetic field in the atmosphere and corona , the magnitude of @xmath152 along the coronal field lines , which is a measure of the rate of twist per unit length , drastically decreases . as a result",
    ", a gradient of the rate of twist is established along the flux tube from the interior into the atmosphere with the interior portion of the flux tube having a much higher rate of twist .",
    "this gradient in the rate of twist drives torsional waves along the flux tube , transporting twist from the interior highly twisted portion into the expanded coronal portion @xcite .",
    "thus the rotational motion will continue until the coronal @xmath141 equilibrates with the interior @xmath141 along the field lines . the time scale for establishing the equilibrium is on the order of the alfvn transient time along the interior flux tube , which means that the rotational motion can persists for a few days after the initial emergence .",
    "depending on how great the stretching of the emerged field lines is compared to the total length of the interior flux tube , it is conceivable that the final equilibrated @xmath141 value is of a significantly smaller magnitude compared to the initial @xmath141 of the subsurface flux tube rising to the photosphere .",
    "this may provide an explanation for the significantly lower @xmath141 values measured for the majority of the solar active regions compared to the twist rate needed for a buoyant flux tube to rise cohesively in the solar interior .",
    "sunspot rotations have been observed in many events preceding x - ray sigmoid brightening and the onset of eruptive flares ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our results suggest that these rotational motions are due to non - linear torsional alfvn waves naturally occurring during the emergence of a twisted flux tube , and is an important means whereby twist is transported from the interior into the corona , driving the development of a coronal flux rope as a precursor structure for solar eruptions",
    ". the horizontal vortical motion and its subsurface extension corresponding to the torsional alfvn waves may be detectable by local helioseismology techniques .",
