    "the development of a quantum memory - a device that can store conjugate quantum variables - is currently being driven by the field of quantum information processing , a field encompassing quantum computing and quantum cryptography .",
    "an ideal quantum memory for these applications would be 100% efficient , with long and controllable storage times , high storage bandwidths , and delay - bandwidth products , and faithful retrieval of the stored information . + their speed and lack of interaction with the environment make photons an ideal carrier for quantum information , unfortunately these same properties make them difficult to store . in recent years , however , much progress has been made towards the development of an optical quantum memory with techniques such as electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) , where recall efficiencies of over 40% in atomic ensembles @xcite and storage times of over 1 second in solid state systems @xcite have been achieved .",
    "another quantum memory candidate is the atomic frequency comb ( afc ) scheme , based on photon echoes , where the re - alignment of atomic dipoles is required for the stored light to be re - emitted .",
    "storage of coherent states with a mean photon number of approximately one has been demonstrated with afc @xcite and a maximum efficiency of 35% has been achieved for a fixed storage time on the order of microseconds ( determined by the bandwidth of the system ) @xcite . + the gradient echo memory ( gem ) technique is also a photon echo based coherent memory .",
    "the key ingredient for gem is a frequency gradient imposed along the memory , as illustrated in figure [ fig : ac_gem](a ) .",
    "not only does this gradient define the bandwidth of the system and cause re - emission of the pulse in the forwards direction by its reversal ( figure [ fig : ac_gem](b ) ) , it also allows for 100% retrieval of the stored pulse if it is monotonic @xcite . by altering the gradient ,",
    "spectral manipulation of the pulse is possible @xcite . in two level solid state systems",
    "an efficiency of 69% for gem has been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "this work was carried out using an electric field ( i.e. dc stark ) gradient created by placing four electrodes at the corners of the ensemble .",
    "+ with a two level system the storage time of gem will be limited by the decay rate from the excited state . by moving to a three level @xmath1 system in the far - detuned regime , as shown in figure [ fig : ac_rb](a )",
    ", an effective two level atom is created .",
    "this is known as @xmath1-gem , and apart from the increase in storage times achievable @xcite , it also allows for pulse resequencing @xcite .",
    "the decay rate of this system is now determined by the ground state decoherence rate . + previous experimental work on @xmath1-gem has used warm ( 65 - 70@xmath2 c ) gas cells , of length 7.5 - 20 cm and diameter 2.5 cm , containing @xmath3rb .",
    "this set - up has achieved efficiencies of up to 41% @xcite and coherence times of 20  @xmath4s .",
    "the frequency shift for the rubidium ensemble was created using a magnetic field ( i.e. zeeman ) gradient , as alkali elements do not have a linear dc stark shift . using magnetic fields created by applying currents to solenoids wrapped around the gas cell , as in the above work , there is a lack of precision control over the gradient .",
    "transient fields , which occur during gradient switching due to the inductance of the coils , also limit the switching time and can affect the rephasing process .",
    "+ one option for improving the gradient creation and control would be to move away from magnetic fields , and the coils necessary to create them , to an ac stark ( acs ) shift .",
    "this would allow for an all - optically controlled quantum memory .",
    "another option for improvement is to move from warm to cold atoms . due to the small decoherence rates in cold atomic ensembles",
    "this would allow for longer storage times and large on - resonance optical depths , due to the increase in density of the atoms .",
    "implementing these improvements in concert would be beneficial as the acs effect is intensity dependent and cold atoms can be persuaded to occupy small volumes , reducing the laser power necessary .",

    "+ the first method involves reversing the intensity profile along the ensemble @xmath222 .",
    "this is equivalent to the field switching method used in @xcite in that by reversing the intensity profile about the centre of the trap ( @xmath223 ) the detunings are also reversed about this point , i.e. @xmath224 . the intensity profiles for this method of switching are shown in figure [ fig : ac_states](a)(i ) , with the corresponding frequency gradients shown in figure [ fig : ac_states](a)(ii ) .",
    "this process involves no change in frequency of the stored pulse with respect to the input pulse .",
    "+ the second method involves switching the polarisation of the field @xmath225 while keeping the same intensity gradient , as shown in figure [ fig : ac_states](b)(i ) .",
    "this is a slightly more complicated process as the detunings are no longer reversed around the centre of the ensemble , with @xmath226 .",
    "this method still results in an echo being produced .",
    "however , the stored pulse will now be frequency shifted with respect to the input pulse , as can be seen from the corresponding frequency gradients shown in figure [ fig : ac_states](b)(ii ) .",
    "this is because a switch from @xmath226 is equivalent to a switch about the centre and an offset of @xmath227 being added . in a three level system",
    "this frequency shift can be overcome by altering the coupling field frequency in such a way as to cancel the initial shift .",
    "it should also be noted that @xmath137 will not contribute to @xmath124 for this switching method as it only depends on the detuning and intensity of the acs laser , both of which will be constant .",
    "+ this second switching method would suggest itself as the easiest to implement as all that is required to switch @xmath147 would be a pockels cell , which have switching times down to nanoseconds .",
    "it would not , however , allow for different frequency gradients and therefore filtering or manipulation of the pulse .",
    "apart from this , if the second switching method is used , then the minima for the scattering rate found in section [ sec : ac_wavelength ] will only apply for either the read or write stages of the memory .",
    "this is because , if the polarisation is reversed , the scattering behaviour of the levels will be reversed ( i.e. @xmath228 .",
    "+ the first switching method would allow for different gradients but involves much longer switching times ( on the order of milliseconds for lcslms ) .",
    "the combination of beam shapers ( bsh ) and pockels cells ( pc ) shown in figure [ fig : ac_setup](a ) allow for flexibility in beam shaping and fast switching times .",
    "if no spatial filtering is desired then only pc2 and bsh1 are needed , with the beam shaper determining the shape of the gradient and the polarisation switch causing the rephasing of the atoms . to allow different gradients to be used",
    ", an extra pockels cell pc1 and beam shaper bsh2 can be used . in this case , the second gradient can be prepared in advance and pc1 used to select which beam shaper to use .",
    "the acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) can be used to switch the acs beam on or off to decrease the scattering rate due to this field ( see following section ) .",
    "one main advantage of moving from warm to cold atoms is the extended storage times that can be achieved .",
    "there are two timescale of importance to our memory : ( i ) the trap lifetime @xmath101 ; and ( ii ) the coherence time @xmath100 .",
    "+ the trap lifetime depends on both the scattering rate of the trapping laser , as well as the rate of inter - atomic collisions",
    ". these will also affect the coherence time .",

    "another effect that must be considered is the inelastic collision rate between the atoms in the trap , as this will also cause a loss of coherence as well as trap population if the atoms are not all situated in the @xmath132 level .",
    "the collision rate in cold atoms has been studied in depth ( see for example @xcite ) with the collisional loss rate of the trap being given by @xmath235 where @xmath236 is the density profile of atoms . as can be seen from the above equation",
    "there are two components to the decay : one due to background gas collisions with coefficient @xmath237 being determined by the background gas pressure ; and one due to inelastic collisions between atoms in the trap with coefficient @xmath238 .",
    "@xmath239 for a dipole trap can , in general , be approximated to 1 s for a trap pressure of @xmath240 mbar @xcite .",
    "+ @xmath238 is perhaps more interesting as it can give an indication of the time between inelastic collisions of the rb atoms themselves . by using low trap laser intensities ,",
    "the rate of hyperfine changing collisions has been estimated to be between @xmath241 @xmath242s@xmath160 @xcite .",
    "@xmath243 will be a lower bound on the total collision rate ( as there are also non - hyperfine changing collisions to take into account ) but will be used to give an approximate rate of collisions . here",
    "we will take @xmath244 @xmath242s@xmath160 .",
    "for the densities we are expecting ( @xmath245 atoms/@xmath242 ) , and assuming a constant density within the trapping volume for simplicity , equation [ eq : ac_trap_loss_rate ] will give an initial , and maximum , collision rate of @xmath246 s@xmath160 .",
    "+ apart from the two sources of decoherence mentioned above , which will also affect the trap lifetime , there are two others that must be considered , namely the scattering rate due to the acs field as well as the coupling field .",
    "the scattering rate for the acs field can be determined as a function of system bandwidth @xmath127 similarly to equation [ eq : ac_optimal_scatering ] to be @xmath247 for the optimal detuning of @xmath248 thz discovered in section [ sec : ac_wavelength ] for the @xmath249 state with @xmath117 , this simplifies to @xmath250 for @xmath220 . + the optical depth of the system depends on the rabi frequency of the coupling field @xmath42 and the one - photon detuning @xmath40 , as was shown in equation [ eq : ac_optical_depth ] .",
    "it therefore makes sense to express the effect of the coupling field on the ground state in terms of these two parameters by using the relation between coupling field intensity @xmath251 and rabi frequency @xmath252 to give @xmath253 for pulses much longer than 1 @xmath4s and @xmath254 , then @xmath255 .",
    "+ the total scattering rate for the system is simply the sum of the individual rates .",
    "the acs and coupling fields are only needed during the reading and writing phases of the memory process which each last for a minimum period determined by the pulse length , i.e. @xmath256 , for single pulses but will become longer for multiple pulse storage . if we define a background scattering rate @xmath257 to include all the decoherence effects that are constantly present , i.e. scattering from the trapping laser , collisions and loss from the trap , and a read / write scattering rate of @xmath258 , then we can determine the total storage efficiency to be @xmath259 where @xmath260 is the time the pulse is stored in the memory .",

    "substituting these values into equations [ eq : ac_optical_depth ] and [ eq : ac_readwrite_efficiency ] gives the read / write efficiency of the system @xmath277 ^ 2 .",

    "figure [ fig : ac_efficiency](a ) shows the total efficiency @xmath280 for different values of @xmath281 , with storage time @xmath261 , and using @xmath282 .",
    "+ as can be seen from the figure , for each ratio of @xmath281 and storage time there is a maximum efficiency .",
    "this is a combination of two effects : firstly the increase in optical depth as the pulse length increases due to the smaller bandwidths required , and extra decoherence that will occur as the storage time increases .",
    "the decoherence is greater for larger values of @xmath281 due to the increase in @xmath283 this entails , and this can also be seen from figure [ fig : ac_efficiency](a ) . in this regime , however , the main source of decoherence is the atomic collisions , with an approximate coherence time of 30 ms .",
    "+ for short pulses ( @xmath284 ms ) and large values of @xmath285 efficiencies approach unity as optical depths will be high and the background decoherence effects will be negligible .",
    "this is therefore a good regime to investigate the delay - bandwidth product ( dbp ) of the memory .",
    "here we define dbp@xmath286 as this will give an indication of the number of pulses ( or bits ) that can be stored in the memory at one time .",
    "+ figure [ fig : ac_efficiency](b ) shows @xmath287 for ( i ) single and ( ii ) multiple pulse storage with @xmath263 @xmath4s .",
    "the difference between the two is that , for multiple pulse storage , the coupling and acs fields are left on at all times , while this is not the case for single pulse storage . as can be seen , single pulse storage with efficiency greater than 90% ( dashed line )",
    "occurs up to approximately @xmath288 . for multiple pulse storage ,",
    "this drops to 50 pulses due to the extra coupling field scattering , while 350 can be stored above the classical efficiency limit of @xmath289 .",
    "currently a maximum of four pulse storage has been achieved with @xmath1-gem with @xmath290 @xcite . to store pulses of 20",
    "@xmath4s length requires a system bandwidth of approximately 200 khz and therefore an acs laser power of less than 2 w in the optimized regime .",
    "we have made two proposals to improve the current experimental implementation of @xmath1-gem .",
    "first , a new method of gradient creation using the ac stark effect .",
    "second , a move from warm to cold atoms , along with the longer coherence times this entails .",
    "+ this paper investigated the experimental viability of these proposals .",
    "firstly , the trapping mechanism was investigated and it was determined that a far - detuned standing - wave dipole trap would not interfere with the acs gradient and have a lifetime on the order of seconds , while providing a small area for the acs laser .",
    "it was found that there is an optimal detuning for the acs field of approximately 5 thz to minimize scattering and maximize bandwidth . with this detuning , and",
    "an optimized beam shape and level scheme , a bandwidth of 150 khz / w could be created .",
    "different methods for gradient switching were investigated and a scheme devised that would allow a switch between any two arbitrary gradients on the order of nanoseconds using pockels cells .",
    "+ finally , factors that would limit the system such as scattering due to the trapping , coupling and acs lasers , as well as collisions between atoms were examined .",
    "these were combined with the read / write efficiency to model the total system efficiency as a function of storage time and it was seen that for long pulses ( @xmath291 ms ) , the coherence time was limited by the atomic collisions to be on the order of 10s of milliseconds .",
    "it was also found that for short pulses ( @xmath284 ms ) , efficiencies approach unity and 50 pulses could be stored in the memory at one time with efficiency greater than 90 % .",
    "the acs laser power required to produce the necessary memory bandwidth to store these pulses would be less than 2 w in the optimized regime .",
    "+ we therefore conclude that using an ac stark gradient with cold atoms is an experimentally viable option for improving the @xmath1-gem system in terms of gradient creation , switching and manipulation , as well as storage times and time - bandwidth products achievable using cold atoms .",
