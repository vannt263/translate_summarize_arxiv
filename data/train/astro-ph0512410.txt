    "since the first astrophysical detection of @xmath0 innershell absorption lines of fe  vii  xii in the x - ray spectrum of iras 13349 + 2438 obtained with the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs ) on board _ xmm - newton _",
    "@xcite , this so - called fe  m - shell unresolved transition array ( uta ) has been identified in many soft x - ray sources .",
    "the uta is mainly comprised of a cluster of lines originating from @xmath1@xmath2 transitions of m - shell iron ions that are located between 1517   .",
    "these lines , when properly modeled , provide important information on the ionization structure , column density , and outflow kinematics of the absorbing materials . @xcite calculated a complete set of atomic data for such modeling using the hebrew university lawrence livermore atomic code ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hullac , ) , and provided an abbreviated list of transition wavelengths , oscillator strengths , and autoionization rates .",
    "that complete data set has also been incorporated in some commonly used plasma modeling codes .    in most observations where the fe",
    "m - shell uta has been identified , individual features from different ionization states are not resolved , mostly due to significant turbulent velocity broadening ( @xmath3  kms@xmath4 ) at the source .",
    "low statistics and insufficient spectral resolution may also hamper the identification of individual charge states .",
    "therefore , one has to depend on global photoionized plasma models to constrain the physical conditions of the absorbing gas . in global fits , where individual utas are unresolved , the exact rest - frame position of each uta is particularly important , especially since current photoionization balance calculations fail to predict the formation of fe  m - shell ions consistently with highly ionized species of other elements @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite have reexamined the _ chandra _ high energy transmission grating spectrometer ( hetgs ) spectrum of the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) of ngc  3783 , by coadding all 900  ks available observations .",
    "the low turbulent velocity of the outflow of ngc  3783 , the high spectral resolution of the hetgs , and the very long exposure time enabled the individual absorption features from different fe  m - shell ions to be resolved .",
    "the analysis of @xcite showed that the outflow velocity associated with the fe  m - shell uta appears to be different from those of other highly - ionized species , namely , fe  xvii , o  vii , and o  viii . in fact , the data prefer a zero velocity for the gas associated with fe  m - shell ions , and a @xmath5  kms@xmath4 outflow velocity for the gas associated with more highly ionized ions . therefore , a two component model was proposed where the fe  m - shell ions are not part of the agn outflow , with an important implication of much lower mass loss rate .",
    "as stated in @xcite , the conclusions of that paper depend strongly on the calculated hullac wavelengths .",
    "the velocities of the fe  m - shell uta can be distinguished from those of other ions only if the hullac wavelengths are accurate to better than 30  m , which corresponds to a velocity of @xmath6590  kms@xmath4  at 16  m .",
    "however , it has been shown that the theoretical method employed by hullac can generally produce uncertainties of up to 2050  m for lines in the 1020   band @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , no laboratory measurements exist for the wavelengths of relevant ions except for a few strong lines of fe  xvi and fe  xv @xcite .",
    "for these few lines , the hullac wavelengths are indeed underestimated by 2030  m .",
    "however , the strongest and cleanest absorption features in the observed spectrum of ngc  3783 are from fe ix  xi . if the hullac wavelengths for these ions are also underestimated by similar amounts , the implied outflow velocity would be similar to that derived from fe  xvii and o ions .",
    "@xcite argued that errors in the calculated wavelengths would be distributed randomly in both directions , and therefore , the systematic shift observed in the data is unlikely a result of theoretical wavelength errors .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that the hullac errors for the strongest 2p3d transitions ( those which determine the uta centroid ) of the fe l - shell ions are generally much smaller than 30  m@xcite .",
    "the present work , however , shows that these indirect indications concerning the hullac accuracy for the fe  m - shell uta wavelengths were misleading and that the assumption that these wavelengths could be used for velocity measurements was premature .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that a combined configuration interaction and second order many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) is capable of predicting wavelengths of @xmath0 transitions of fe  xvii  xxiv to within a few m .",
    "the @xmath0 lines of the fe  m - shell uta are similar to those of fe xvii - xxiv , except for the addition of m - shell spectator electrons . following the unexpected result of @xcite , in this paper , we apply an improved version of the mbpt method to the @xmath0 transitions of fe  vi  xvi .",
    "the resulting wavelengths of the uta lines are found to be systematically larger than hullac ones by 1545  m .",
    "we also give improved autoionization rates , which are significantly larger than the previous hullac results .",
    "the new data are used to model the ngc  3783 spectrum , and the outflow velocity derived from fe  m - shell uta is found to be consistent with that associated with fe  xvii and o  vii ",
    "viii ions .    in  [ theory ]",
    ", we describe the detail of mbpt and its implementation . ",
    "[ result ] presents the results of the calculation , and their comparison with the previous hullac data set .",
    "a brief summary is given in  [ conclusion ] .",
    "the present calculation is based on the rayleigh - schrdinger perturbation theory for a multi - configurational model space .",
    "the brief description of the method presented here closely follows @xcite , and readers interested in a more detailed account should consult @xcite .",
    "the method tries to solve the schrdinger equation @xmath7 with perturbation expansion .",
    "the no - pair dirac - coulomb - breit ( dcb ) hamiltonian @xmath8 for an @xmath9-electron ionic system can be written as @xcite , @xmath10 + \\sum_{i < j } \\left(\\frac{1}{r_{ij } } + b_{ij}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the dirac hamiltonian for one free electron , @xmath12 is the nuclear charge , @xmath13 is the radial coordinate of the electron @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the distance between the electrons @xmath14 and @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the frequency - independent breit interaction @xmath18,\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is a matrix vector constructed from pauli spin matrices @xmath20 @xmath21    @xmath8 is split up into a model hamiltonian @xmath22 , and a perturbation @xmath23 . in the present case , a convenient choice is @xmath24 \\nonumber\\\\ v & = & -\\sum_i\\left[\\frac{z}{r_i}+u(r_i)\\right ] + \\sum_{i < j } \\left(\\frac{1}{r_{ij } } + b_{ij}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is a model potential including the screening effects of all electrons , whose appropriate choice makes @xmath23 as small as possible . in many applications , @xmath25 is taken to be the hartree - fock potential of a suitable configuration .",
    "such a choice simplifies the many - body expansion because many terms in the series vanish exactly .",
    "however , hartree - fock potential is non - local and complicates the generation of the zero - th order radial wavefunctions . in the present implementation",
    ", @xmath25 is approximated by a local central potential , and is derived from a dirac - fock - slater self - consistent field calculation , which minimizes the weighted mean energy of all relevant configurations .",
    "as long as the perturbation potential @xmath23 is kept small enough , the exact choice for @xmath25 does not affect the final results .    the eigenfunctions @xmath26 and eigenvalues @xmath27 of @xmath22 are easily obtained by forming slater determinants from single - electron wavefunctions once @xmath25 is determined .",
    "a subset of @xmath26 will define a model space @xmath28 , and the remaining states belong to the orthogonal space @xmath9 . a projection operator @xmath29 is defined for @xmath28 , which produces a state in the model space when operated on an eigenfunction of the full hamiltonian @xmath30 where @xmath31 is generally a linear combination of the subset of @xmath26 that belong to the model space @xmath28 .",
    "as described in @xcite , one can define a wave operator , @xmath32 , that transforms @xmath31 back to @xmath33 , @xmath34 the original schrdinger equation can then be transformed to @xmath35 this equation defines an effective hamiltonian in the model space @xmath36    whose eigenvalues are the true eigenenergies of the full hamiltonian .",
    "the effective hamiltonian is generally non - hermitian , and the eigenfunctions , @xmath31 are not necessarily orthogonal .",
    "it follows from the schrdinger equation and the definition of @xmath32 that the wave operator satisfies @xmath37 = v\\omega - \\omega v\\omega,\\ ] ] which is the starting point of the many - body expansion formula .",
    "the first order expansion of @xmath38 can be written as @xmath39 in terms of matrix elements in the model space @xmath28 .",
    "the first order effective hamiltonian is then @xmath40 where @xmath41 , and @xmath42 . by solving the generalized eigenvalue problem for the first order effective hamiltonian , one obtains the eigenvalues in second order .",
    "the energy levels obtained in the present work are based on the solution of this generalized eigenvalue problem .",
    "this is slightly different from the method used in @xcite , where following @xcite , the total second order energy is expressed as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the eigenvalues of @xmath45 in the model space with the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath46 , and @xmath47 is the second order correction due to correlations in the space @xmath9 @xmath48 this is in fact a good approximation of the generalized eigenvalue solution for @xmath49 . if one replaces the eigenvectors @xmath46 with the true eigenvectors @xmath50 of @xmath49 , the above expression becomes the exact eigenvalues of the first order effective hamiltonian .",
    "the uncertainties introduced by using the eigenvectors of @xmath45 instead of @xmath49 are generally of higher order , making it a valid approximation . nonetheless , the more accurate method of solving the generalized eigenvalue problem for @xmath49 is used in the present work .    in the present work ,",
    "we restrict the calculation to the ground state energies of @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) configurations , and the energies for states in the @xmath53 configuration that are connected to the ground state by electric dipole transitions .",
    "these are the absorption lines that appear in agn where the ions are predominantly in the ground states .",
    "the model potential are calculated separately for the @xmath51 and @xmath53 configurations .",
    "the model space @xmath28 consists of these configurations , and the @xmath9 space consists of all single and double excitations from them . because the @xmath9 space contains not only bound states , but also continuum ,",
    "a finite basis set method is used to evaluate the perturbation expansion to convergence .",
    "the basis set is derived by imposing the boundary condition @xmath54 for the single electron radial wavefunctions , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the small and large components of the dirac spinor , @xmath57 is the boundary radius , which is chosen to be large enough to contain the @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 wavefunction amplitudes , and @xmath61 is an arbitrary constant chosen to be @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the relativistic angular momentum quantum number of the one - electron orbital , and @xmath64 is the speed of light . with this choice",
    ", the boundary condition reduces to @xmath65 in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "several small corrections to the hamiltonian are also included in the calculations , namely , finite nuclear size , nuclear recoil , vacuum polarization , and electron self - energy .",
    "these are all taken into account with standard procedures of the atomic structure theory .",
    "in addition to energies , we also calculate the oscillator strengths and radiative rates for @xmath59-@xmath66 transitions that are connected to the ground state of each ion .",
    "because the @xmath53 states are highly autoionizing , the autoionization rates dominate the total lifetime of these levels .",
    "we calculate all possible autoionization channels between @xmath53 and @xmath67 configurations . in calculating the radiative and autoionization rates ,",
    "one may either use the eigenvectors @xmath46 of @xmath45 , or the generalized eigenvectors @xmath50 of @xmath49 .",
    "we have verified that the differences in the two choices are within @xmath6 20% for the ions considered in the present work , and we adopt the results of the latter method , which is generally not very different from that of hullac .    for ions from fe",
    "i  v , we have not carried out the mbpt calculation , since mbpt is expected to be less accurate for near neutral ions , and also because these ions are more complex . to give a complete database for the fe  m - shell uta , we have made simple configuration interaction calculations for them , and present the results along with mbpt calculations for fe  vi  xvi .",
    "in figure  [ fig : flambda ] , we compare the wavelengths and absorption oscillator strengths of the present calculation and those of @xcite for fe  vii  xvi . as can be seen , the oscillator strengths in the two calculations agree well with each other except for a few isolated weak transitions",
    ". however , the wavelengths in the present work are systematically larger than the hullac results by 1545  m for some of the strongest lines . the differences between the oscillator strength weighted wavelengths in the two calculations are also shown in the figure .",
    "we have no simple explanation for why the mbpt wavelengths are systematically longer than the configuration - interaction method of hullac .",
    "table  [ tab : lines ] gives the complete list of fe  m - shell uta transitions with the ground states as the lower levels .",
    "the database is a combination of mbpt results for fe  vi  xvi and configuration interaction results for fe  i  v .",
    "the tabulated data consist of wavelengths , oscillator strengths , radiative transition rates , and autoionization rates .",
    "the autoionization rates are sums over all relevant autoionization channels .",
    "the radiative transition rates are those between the ground states and the specific upper levels , i.e. , possible radiative decays to excited states are not included .",
    "the omission of these alternative radiative channels should have negligible effects on the total natural widths of the upper levels , since autoionization rates dominate the radiative rates in most cases , and for a few lines of fe  xvi and xv , where radiative rates are comparable to autoionization rates , decays to the ground states are the dominant branches .",
    "in addition to wavelengths , another major difference between the present and the earlier calculations of @xcite is in the autoionization rates .",
    "the present autoionization rates are significantly larger than the previous results , especially for lower charge states .",
    "the discrepancy is caused by additional autoionization channels that are included here .",
    "let us take the @xmath68 excited levels of fe  ix as an example . in @xcite , only the autoionization channels that involve the ejection of the 3d electron , i.e. toward @xmath69 , were considered .",
    "the present addition of channels to levels of @xmath70 gives total autoionization rates that are @xmath63.7 times higher .",
    "the increased autoionization rates broaden further the natural line width and may have implications for the curve of growth if turbulent broadening is particularly small . on the other hand ,",
    "if the source has significant turbulent broadening exceeding hundreds of kms@xmath4 , as is the usual case for agn outflows , this effect is unlikely to be observed .",
    "@xcite recently reanalyzed the hetgs spectra of ngc  3783 in the fe m - shell uta region .",
    "the hullac data of @xcite was used in that analysis .",
    "the major conclusion was that the outflow velocity of the gas associated with fe  m - shell ions are significantly less than that derived from the fe  xvii , o  vii , and o  viii lines . by comparing the deepest observed centroid of each ion and the hullac - calculated individual - ion centroid for fe  ix ",
    "xvi , velocities between @xmath71 and @xmath72  kms@xmath4 were derived . the same comparison , but now carried out with the present mbpt data is shown in table  [ tab : ngc3783 ] .",
    "except for a few ions where the identification of a unique uta centroid becomes difficult , the velocities range between @xmath73 and @xmath74  kms@xmath4 . we have fitted a uniform outflow velocity ( @xmath5  kms@xmath4 ) model to the same ngc  3783 spectrum of @xcite , using the present atomic data for fe  vi  xvi .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : ngc3783 ] .",
    "inspection of figure  [ fig : ngc3783 ] shows that no systematic discrepancies between the observed and theoretical absorption features for the fe  m - shell uta can be readily identified , and therefore , the fe  m - shell and other more ionized ions appear to belong to the same kinematic system .",
    "we have been able to identify one single laboratory measurement of fe  xvi lines against which we may check the accuracy of the present calculation .",
    "@xcite gave the wavelengths of the three strongest @xmath1@xmath2 transitions identified in the emission spectrum taken at the lawrence livermore national laboratory s electron beam ion trap .",
    "one of the three lines is blended with a strong fe  xvii line , and the other two lines are unblended , which allowed the accurate determination of their wavelengths .",
    "the two lines are @xmath75(@xmath76)@xmath77(@xmath78 ) transitions , and have measured wavelengths of 15.208(4 ) and 15.115(6 )   .",
    "the present work gives wavelengths of 15.2086 and 15.1127   respectively , which agree very well with the measured values . in the contrary",
    ", @xcite gave wavelengths of 15.1890 and 15.0762   respectively , which are 20 - 40  m too small .",
    "@xcite also identified the strongest fe  xv line , @xmath79(@xmath80)@xmath81(@xmath82 ) , in their spectrum , but did not give its measured wavelength . through inspection of figure  1 in their paper and private communications",
    ", we estimate that its wavelength is 15.353(5 )   , which also agrees reasonably well with the present result of 15.3588   , but 37  m larger than the hullac result .",
    "unfortunately , the fe  xv and xvi absorption lines are relatively weak in the ngc  3783 spectrum , and fe  xvi lines are severely blended with fe  xvii lines .",
    "nevertheless , the excellent agreement between the present results and the measurement for these few lines lends credibility to the mbpt treatment of the entire iso - nuclear sequence .",
    "we have developed a second order many - body perturbation theory with multi - reference model space .",
    "we apply the method to the calculation of wavelengths , oscillator strengths , and autoionization rates of fe  m - shell uta arising from @xmath1@xmath2 transitions originating from the ground state of fe vi - xvi .",
    "the wavelengths obtained in the present work are systematically larger than the hullac calculation of @xcite ; the present oscillator strengths of the strong absorption lines agree well with the hullac results ; and the autoionization rates of @xcite are found to be missing important autoionization channels , especially for lower charge states . using the present data for fe  vi ",
    "xvi , we find no evidence that the outflow velocity of the gas associated with fe  m - shell ions is different from that derived from fe  xvii and o  vii ",
    "viii ions , as claimed in the recent analysis of @xcite using the hullac data .",
    "a complete list of fe  m - shell uta lines are given , which include the present mbpt calculation for fe  vi  xvi , and a simple configuration interaction calculation for fe  i  v .",
    "we recommend that this new database should be preferred over the earlier hullac calculation of @xcite in the analyses of future absorption spectroscopy where fe  m - shell uta is prominent .",
