    "the flow around objects in a bulk medium is a classical problem in fluid dynamics which occurs in numerous natural phenomena and has many practical applications .",
    "the majority of research concerns high reynolds number flows , where vortex shedding plays an important role , and mixing is greatly enhanced  @xcite . until recently , and even though it was pointed out more than 60 years ago , much less attention has been given to mixing due to the drift volume , a mechanism described by potential flow known as darwin s drift  @xcite .",
    "one of the recent studies has shown that for many marine animals darwin s drift is the dominant contribution to mixing by swimming  @xcite .",
    "darwin s original proposition states that the drift volume induced by an object , which was started infinitely far away from an imaginary plane and moves infinitely far to the other side of the plane is equal to the added mass volume of that object  @xcite .",
    "this prediction is based on potential flow , and has been confirmed two decades ago by eames _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who added specific information concerning the method of evaluating the integrals to calculate the drift volume and of taking into account partial drift for finite systems .",
    "an open question is how the drift volume is influenced in the case of a less smooth object , or at higher reynolds numbers , when flow separation starts to play a role .",
    "this problem is related to the drift volume of a vortex ring , which was considered analytically for a continuously expanding vortex  @xcite and experimentally for a steady vortex ring  @xcite .",
    "we approach this problem experimentally by impulsively starting a disc from the interface of two immiscible liquids , oil and water , similarly and with the same setup as we did before when studying the dynamics of an air - water interface when a disc would impact it  @xcite . besides being a practical solution to studying drift volumes , this method has relevance for , e.g. , the mechanism of oil dispersion in water  @xcite . in our experiment ,",
    "when the disc moves down , it drags along the oil , which then obtains a particular funnel - shaped profile ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : sequence_thick_layer ] ) . both gravity and surface tension",
    "are deforming the shapes , and we determine how these profiles depend on the velocity of the disc .",
    "we observe that there exists a universal profile which becomes more prominent for higher velocities , for which this universal shape will extend deeper into the fluid .",
    "surprisingly , however , despite the observed universal behavior , these profiles do not agree with potential flow simulations we performed using a boundary integral technique .",
    "we attribute this difference to the formation of a vortex ring , which distorts the potential flow .",
    "we specifically show that the drift volume is _ larger _ than that predicted by potential flow .",

    "a linear motor that was mounted below the tank pulls a disc with a radius @xmath3 through the water surface at a constant speed @xmath1 , by means of a thin rod ( radius 3 mm ) connecting the linear motor with the disc .",
    "the disc was accelerated with a maximum acceleration of @xmath4 until the desired velocity ( @xmath1 ) was reached .",
    "the events were recorded with a photron sa2 high - speed color camera at frame rates ranging from @xmath5 to @xmath6 .",
    "the main control parameter of the experiment is an effective froude number @xmath7 , which is similar to the regular froude number defined as the disc speed @xmath1 , made dimensionless using the disc radius @xmath0 and the gravitational acceleration @xmath8 . only we replace @xmath8 by the effective gravitational acceleration @xmath9 of the oil phase inside the water phase , as one would use to determine the wave speed of gravitational waves on a density interface @xmath10 @xcite , yielding @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the densities of water and oil respectively . in our experiments we used sunflower oil , which has a density @xmath14 and a viscosity @xmath15 .",

    "is still unaffected by gravity at this point in time .    in order to see what the effect of the density difference is on the shape that we obtain at high froude numbers , we performed experiments with demineralized water ( @xmath42 ) at @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) and with salt water ( @xmath45 ) at @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "although there is a factor two in the density difference between the oil and the water phases ( demineralized vs. salt water ) , the difference in the profiles is negligible , which leads us to conclude that the shape of the entrained oil column does not strongly depend on the relative density difference between the fluids .",
    "the use of salt water does however have an experimental advantage : the oil - water interface became less contaminated with oil and water droplets after the experiment is finished , which reduced the time that we had to wait between two experiments until the surface was smooth enough to clearly observe formation of the profile of the entrained oil . for experimental convenience , we used salt water in all experiments , except noted otherwise .",

    "a closer inspection reveals that the discrepancy increases as the disc moves further down : while at @xmath39 ( @xmath52 ) there is a reasonable agreement between the simulation and experiment , at @xmath41 ( @xmath53 ) the difference is much larger .",

    "the experiment on the other hand shows a significant increase in radius after the initial decrease   of the minimum radius ) than in the experiment ] .",
    "a qualitative explanation for both these observations originates from the formation and growth of the vortex which introduces an additional downward velocity ( and velocity gradient ) inside the entrained volume of oil , since oil will continuously flow into the vortex .",
    "there where the shape of the entrained oil volume @xmath74 is column - like ( i.e. , @xmath75 is small ) , this will lead to simple stretching and thus a decreasing radius of the column  @xcite .",
    "however , where there exists a large gradient in the radius , the overall downward translation may introduce an increase in radius in the lab frame .",
    "this can be seen as follows . because the volume @xmath76 of the entrained oil is conserved",
    ", the interface @xmath74 obeys the pde @xmath77 where @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) is the downward velocity in the vertical direction inside the column , which for simplicity is assumed to be independent of the radial coordinate .",
    "this can immediately be rewritten as @xmath80 note that for such a stretching flow the second term in the above expression is always negative , since @xmath81 for the measured profiles , whereas the third ( or stretching ) term is always positive because @xmath82 . in case of a purely columnar shape ,",
    "the second term is zero , and therefore @xmath83 is negative . in case of a funnel - shaped profile with a strong radial gradient ( @xmath84 ) and sufficient downward velocity",
    ", the magnitude of the second term may well be larger than the stretching term , which will result in a positive @xmath83 .",
    "the remaining question is why we still observe universal shapes even though there is a clear influence from the vortex .",
    "the reason is that for early times ( @xmath85 ) the dimensionless size and strength of a vortex behind a impulsively started disc is independent of the disc speed , as was shown in  @xcite .",
    "that the same holds for our experiments can clearly be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : sequence_thick_layer ] , where the vortex for @xmath86 has the same size as that for @xmath87 , when they are compared at the same dimensionless time .",
    "we now proceed to providing an estimate of the magnitude of the downward velocity @xmath88 due to the presence of the vortex .",
    "given the circulation @xmath89 of a vortex line in a closed loop @xmath90 , the velocity @xmath91 at position @xmath92 can be obtained from the biot - savart law @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the core of the vortex line . for a ring - shaped vortex with a radius equal to the disc radius @xmath0 we can write for points @xmath92 on the axis of symmetry that , taking into account that the velocity is purely vertical , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , with @xmath97 the unit vector in the @xmath69-direction , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the vertical position of the core of the vortex .",
    "the @xmath69-component of the integral of eq .",
    "( [ eq : biotsavart ] ) can now be evaluated straightforwardly as @xmath101 and gives the vertical component of the velocity @xmath88 as @xmath102 or , in dimensionless form , @xmath103 where @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and the dimensionless , time - dependent circulation @xmath106 is independent of the disc speed  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : vzvortex ] we compare the vertical velocity on the axis of symmetry resulting from our potential flow calculation to the one induced by the vortex ring at different instances of time .",
    "we have used the empirical relation from yang  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite for @xmath107  ] and approximated the velocity of the vortex core to be linear ( i.e. , @xmath108 ) .",
    "the latter approximately matches the position of the vortex core in the experiments , where we observe that the core is about one disc radius above the disc at @xmath41 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sequence_thick_layer ] ) . clearly , the velocities and velocity gradients are greatly enhanced by the starting vortex , and an influence on the shape of the entrained oil column is therefore expected .",
    "most importantly note that the velocity profiles of fig .",
    "[ fig : vzvortex ] are independent of the disc velocity , resulting in a mechanism through which the universality of the shapes shown in fig .  [ fig : all_profiles ] are preserved .",
    "comparison of the estimated non - dimensional velocity @xmath104 on the axis of symmetry as a function of the non - dimensional distance @xmath109 to the center of the disc for the potential flow solution ( solid line ) and the time - dependent contribution from the vortex ring ( dotted lines ) at four different instances in dimensionless time @xmath110 . ]    to further quantify the influence of the vortex on the drift volume , we calculate the entrained volume of oil in both the simulations and the experiment . because a part of the interface is masked by the vortex",
    ", we do not calculate the complete displaced volume  @xcite , but only compare the part that is accessible in both the experiment and the simulation . in the simulations we find , at @xmath41 , between the depths @xmath111 and @xmath71 ( with @xmath2 at the unperturbed oil / water interface ) , an entrained volume of 4.24 ml , while in the experiment 7.25 ml of oil is entrained .",
    "extending the range to @xmath73 gives 5.57 ml and 8.66 ml for the simulation and experiment respectively .",
    "clearly , the experimental volume of entrained oil is significantly larger than the volume predicted by the potential flow simulations .",
    "we have performed experiments where we started a disc at an oil - water interface and pulled it down at a constant speed . we have shown that at high speeds , gravity and surface tension can be neglected , and the entrained oil obtains a universal funnel shape , independent of the froude number . however",
    ", a vortex ring is formed at the disc edge , which influences the shape of the entrained oil resulting in a qualitative and quantitative difference compared to the potential flow solution .",
    "nonetheless , the universality of the funnel shape is conserved .",
    "the shape also appears insensitive to the relative density difference , at least for the density differences studied .",
    "the effect might be investigated further for flows at lower reynolds numbers , exploring the limit where the vortex disappears . in our current setup",
    "this regime is inaccessible due to the influence of gravity at low disc speeds .",
    "a consequence of our finding is that the displaced volume as predicted by @xcite is underestimated in cases where flow separation is of importance .",
    "this introduces a non - trivial shape - effect on the entrainment in the wake of , for example , ocean life @xcite . the preserved universality in such cases , however , may help in simplifying and generalizing analysis in these situations .",
