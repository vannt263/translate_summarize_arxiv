    "ongoing doppler radial velocity surveys of nearby stars have detected over 200 extrasolar planets in the past decade @xcite .",
    "those surveys focus on late f , g , k , and m dwarfs within 50 pc and most of the planets they have found to date are more massive than saturn , and are presumably gas giants . recently , several neptune - mass and lower mass planets have been detected , most of them with orbital periods of a few days @xcite    as the search for new extrasolar planets continues , doppler surveys now look through a broad parameter space , including long - period jupiter analogs , very low mass planets in short - period orbits , multiple planetary systems , and new planets around stars with spectral types that extend beyond the ones traditionally been searched , i.e. k0v to f8v .",
    "the n2k program @xcite is a doppler survey with distributed observing campaigns at the keck , magellan and subaru telescopes , and is primarily aimed at increasing the number of known hot jupiters . because of their proximity to the host stars , the atmospheres of hot jupiters can be as hot as 2000 k , resulting in detectable emission at ir wavelengths .",
    "this makes these short period planets ideal targets for spaceborn follow up to observe exoplanet atmospheres @xcite , especially when they transit their host stars and undergo a secondary eclipse so that small differential changes in emission from the star - planet system can be measured ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is also important to have a sample of hot jupiters that is large enough to provide meaningful constraints on the formation , migration , and evolution mechanisms of these planets @xcite .",
    "the n2k program searches a fresh sample of the `` next 2000 '' stars , not included in other current doppler surveys , by extending the search radius to distances of 100110 parsecs from the sun .",
    "this project is intentionally biased towards metal rich stars to exploit the correlation between formation of gas giant planets and high stellar metallicity @xcite .",
    "the search strategy is optimized for the detection of jupiter - mass planets with orbital periods shorter than 14 days by obtaining radial velocity measurements on three consecutive nights .",
    "variability in the velocity of the host star over this short timescale flags the star as a candidate host for a short - period planet .",
    "however , gas giant planets in longer orbits are also identified and detected with additional observations . as an example , the n2k programs at the keck and subaru telescopes have already detected seven planets with periods between 21 days and 3.13 years @xcite .    here , we report the detection of the first two planets from the magellan n2k program .",
    "this program has been underway at the magellan telescopes at las campanas observatory in chile since 2004 , and includes @xmath4 300 fgk metal rich stars at distances between 50 and 100 parsecs .",
    "the new planets are orbiting the stars hd 154672 and hd 205739 .",
    "both host stars showed significant radial velocity scatter in the first year of observations and were initially flagged as hot jupiter candidates .",
    "however , follow - up observations over subsequent years revealed the presence of longer period planets and a trend on the radial velocity curve of hd 205739 that continues to increase after over 3.5 years .",

    "the bolometric luminosity of the star is @xmath7 = 1.88 @xmath8 , where we have included a bolometric correction of -0.09 derived from the empirical transformations of @xcite , using the effective temperature , surface gravity and metallicity of the star .",
    "our high resolution spectroscopic analysis , described in @xcite , yields @xmath9 = 5714 @xmath5 45 k , log g = 4.25 @xmath5 0.08 , @xmath10 = 1.0 @xmath5 0.5 km s@xmath3 , and [ fe / h ] = + 0.26 @xmath5 0.04 for hd154672 .",
    "the radius of the star derived from the stefan - boltzmann relation and the values of the luminosity and effective temperature above is 1.39 @xmath11 .",
    "we have also derived a stellar mass of 1.06 @xmath12 , a radius of 1.27 @xmath11 and an age of about 9.3 gyr using the @xcite grid of evolutionary models , based on the yale stellar evolution code and tuned to the uniform spectroscopic analysis of @xcite .",
    "the resultant log g is 4.26@xmath13 , in agreement with the results of the spectroscopic analysis .",
    "the uncertainties in these parameters correspond to a 95% credibility interval using bayesian posterior probability distributions .",

    "the hipparcos parallax of the star is 11.07 @xmath5 1.12 milliarcseconds , placing it at a distance of 90.3 @xmath5 9.1 parsecs .",
    "this sets the absolute magnitude of hd 205739 to @xmath6 = 3.78 , and its bolometric luminosity to @xmath7 = 2.3 @xmath8 .",
    "the value of @xmath7 , includes a bolometric correction of -0.03 derived from the same empirical transformations of @xcite mentioned above .",

    "we can therefore reject activity as the cause of the observed radial velocity variations of the stars .",
    "based on these observations , we adopt a conservative upper limit to the expected jitter ( or astrophysical noise ) of the stars of about 4 m s@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "doppler observations were carried out between mid 2004 and february 2008 at the magellan clay telescope using the mike spectrograph ( bernstein et al .",

    "the second source of noise is systematic instrumental errors , which for mike has a root mean square ( rms ) deviation of 5 m s@xmath3 , as derived from a subset of observed stars that appear to have stable radial velocities over the time span of the observations .",
    "a sample of stable stars measured with mike is presented in figures 1 and 2 of minniti et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "we obtained a total of 16 radial velocity measurements for hd 154672 and 24 measurements for hd 205739 .",
    "those measurements are summarized in tables 2 and 3 , including the observation dates and the radial velocity formal uncertainties introduced by photon - limited noise .",

    "set , we modeled the radial velocities to fit single planet keplerian orbits using a levenberg - marquardt fitting algorithm . in the case of",
    "it was necessary to include an additional variable linear trend to best reproduce the observed radial velocity variations .",
    "the parameter uncertainties of each best model fit were estimated by running 1000 monte carlo trials on each data set , where the model result of each trial was subtracted from the individual data points and the residual velocities scrambled and added back to the velocities predicted by the models , before running a new trial fit .",
    "the adopted final uncertainties of each parameter are derived from the standard deviation of all the model trials .",
    "the parameter values of the best keplerian model fit for each target are summarized in table 4 .",
    "the best model for hd154672 has an orbital period of 163.94 @xmath5 0.01 days , radial velocity semi - amplitude @xmath15 = 225 @xmath5 2 m s@xmath3 , and orbital eccentricity @xmath2 = 0.61 @xmath5 0.03 .",

    "a long term trend still appear large , showing points that deviate about 2@xmath19 from the average @xmath44 m s@xmath3 precision of the individual data points , however , an analysis of the periodogram of those residuals reveals no significant peaks , so we can not discard nor confirm the presence of additional shorter period planets in this system with the current dataset .",
    "the amplitude of the observed radial velocity variations for each star is 10100 times larger than the uncertainties of the individual radial velocity measurements , what makes the possibility that the detected signals are caused by noise fluctuations very unlikely .",
    "we quantitatively assert this statement by performing a false alarm probability ( fap ) analysis of the data using the method described by @xcite ( see  5.2 ) , with the inclusion of possible linear trends @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : fap205739 ] shows the result of 1000 fap trial tests for hd205739 .",

    "a similar analysis of the hd154672 data gives a negligible fap ( @xmath22 1.0@xmath21 ) . in this last case ,",
    "the median @xmath20 of the fap histogram is about 30 , the first percently @xmath20 is 16.1 , and the minimum @xmath20 after 1000 trial tests is 12.5 .",
    "none of the fap trial fits produces a @xmath20 lower than the value reported above for the best keplerian fit for hd 154672 .",
    "we present two new jovian  mass planets orbiting metal rich stars .",
    "hd 154672b is a fairly massive planet with a mass of m@xmath23 = 4.96 @xmath18 and a very pronounced orbital eccentricity of @xmath2 = 0.61 , that causes the planet to move from 0.23 to 0.96 au between periastron and apastron .",
    "the planet will therefore experience surface temperature changes of about 300k along its orbit , reaching a maximum temperature at periastron of about 600k , assuming the albedo of the planet is low .",
    "if water is present in the atmosphere of hd 154672b , it could transition between gaseous and liquid phases along the planet s orbit .    when placed in the eccentricity vs. orbital period parameter space diagram of known exoplanets illustrated in figure  [ fig : eccvsp ]",
    ", hd 154672b shows an orbital eccentricity larger than 90% of the discovered planets , and is only the seventh planet found with an orbital period shorter than 300 days and an eccentricity larger than 0.6 . of the other six planets , four",

    "* ) , to have a brown dwarf companion ( hd 3651 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to be part of a wide stellar binary system ( hd 80606 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or to present a large radial velocity trend induced by a distant body associated to that system ( hd 37605 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the high eccentricies in those cases can be explained by either kozai oscillations @xcite or chaotic evolution of planetary orbits in multiple systems .",
    "another planet in this subgroup , hd 17156 , has been recently reported to have a large orbital axis misalignment with respect to the stellar rotation axis , that can be best explained by gravitational interactions with other planets @xcite .",

    ", the parameters of this planet do not seem atypical . for planets with orbital periods",
    "longer than 20 days , the mean eccentricity is 0.29 , therefore hd205739b has an orbital eccentricity that is typical of detected planets that have not experienced tidal circularization .",
    "the separation of hd205739b from its host star changes from 0.65 au to 1.14 au between periastron and apastron .",
    "the maximum surface temperature of this planet is expected to be of the order of 400k , and the amplitude of its surface temperature change will only be of about 100k along the entire orbit .",
    "one peculiarity of the radial velocity curve of hd 205739 is the presence of a pronounced trend of 0.0649 m s@xmath3 per day , indicating the presence of an additional outer body in the system with an orbital period longer than the 3.5 year time span covered by our observations , and a radial velocity semi - amplitude greater than 35 m s@xmath3 . finally , the residuals of our best fit are a factor of two larger than expected , what hints the possible presence of other bodies in this system . however , more observations are needed to confirm this hypothesis .",
