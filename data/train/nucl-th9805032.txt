    "hypernuclei are bound systems of neutrons , protons and one or more strange baryons , such as the @xmath0 or @xmath1 hyperons .",
    "understanding the behavior of hypernuclei ( how they are produced , their spectroscopy and decay mechanisms ) has been the subject of intense investigations during the last decades , see e.g. , refs.@xcite .",
    "one of the main goals of such studies is to explore how the presence of the new degree of freedom ( strangeness ) alters and broadens the knowledge achieved from conventional nuclear physics .",
    "several features of the @xmath0 single - particle properties in the nucleus , being essentially different from those of the nucleon , have clearly emerged from these efforts .",
    "it is well accepted nowadays that the depth of the @xmath0-nucleus potential is around @xmath2 mev , which is 20 mev less attractive than the corresponding nucleon - nucleus one .",
    "the spin - orbit splittings of single particle levels in @xmath0 hypernuclei were found to be much smaller than their nucleonic counterparts@xcite , typically more than one order of magnitude .",
    "moreover , the @xmath0 , contrary to the nucleon , maintains its single - particle character even for states well below the fermi surface @xcite indicating a weaker interaction with other nucleons .",
    "studies of the mesonic weak decay of light @xmath0 hypernuclei @xcite have shown that the data @xcite clearly favour @xmath0-nucleus potentials which show a repulsion at short distances .",
    "this seems also to be a characteristic of the @xmath1-nucleus potential for light @xmath1-hypernuclei @xcite , which reproduces the recently measured bound @xmath3 state in @xmath4he with the in - flight @xmath5he@xmath6 reaction @xcite .",
    "this experiment confirms , with new and better statistics , the earlier results from the @xmath5he(stopped @xmath7 reaction @xcite .    attempts to derive the hyperon properties in a nucleus have followed several approaches .",
    "a @xmath0-nucleus potential of woods - saxon type reproduces reasonably well the measured @xmath0 single - particle energies of medium to heavy hypernuclei @xcite .",
    "non localities and density dependent effects , included in non - relativistic hartree - fock calculations using skyrme hyperon - nucleon ( @xmath8 ) interactions @xcite , improve the overall fit to the single - particle binding energies .",
    "the properties of hypernuclei have also been studied in a relativistic framework , such as dirac phenomenology @xcite or relativistic mean field theory @xcite .",
    "microscopic calculations , which aim at relating the hypernuclear observables to the bare @xmath8 interaction , are also available .",
    "this approach is especially interesting because it can be used to put further constraints on the @xmath8 interactions , which are not completely determined by the limited amount of scattering data due , essentially , to the experimental difficulties associated with the short lifetime of hyperons and low intensity beam fluxes .",
    "microscopic hypernuclear structure calculations are performed with an effective @xmath8 interaction ( @xmath9-matrix ) obtained from the bare @xmath8 potential through a bethe - goldstone equation .",

    "energy for the finite nucleus including corrections up to second order .",
    "the obtained self ",
    "energy for the @xmath0 is non - local and depends on the energy of the hyperon . solving the schrdinger equation with this self  energy it is possible to determine the single - particle energies and wave functions of the bound hyperon .",
    "the approach also provides automatically the real and imaginary part of the hyperon optical potential at positive energies and , therefore , allows to study the hyperon - nucleus scattering properties .",
    "the method was first employed to study the nucleon and @xmath11 properties in nuclei @xcite and later applied to calculate the @xmath12-wave non - local @xmath0 self  energy in @xmath10o , from which the single - particle @xmath0 binding energy was obtained @xcite .",

    "( [ eq : gexpan2 ] ) .",
    "we will consider the incoming ( outcoming ) hyperon as a plane wave and the nucleon hole states as harmonic oscillator ones , so the two - body wave function will be a mixed representation of both single - particle states given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the quantum numbers of the nucleon hole state and the hyperon state , respectively .",

    "the single - hole energies @xmath73 have been taken equal to the experimental single - particle energies in most of the nuclei studied ( e.g. , @xmath74c , @xmath75o , @xmath76ca ) and have been calculated from a woods - saxon potential with spin - orbit and coulomb terms appropriately fitted in other cases ( e.g. , @xmath77zr and @xmath78pb ) .",
    "the quantities @xmath79 are the quantum numbers of the intermediate @xmath80 states .",
    "next , we obtain the real part through a dispersion relation @xmath81 where @xmath82 means a principal value integral .",
    "finally , we must subtract the @xmath70 correction term coming from the nuclear matter intermediate propagator ( third term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gexpan2 ] ) ) .",
    "it reads @xmath83 where @xmath19 is the nuclear matter pauli operator and @xmath21 is the nuclear matter starting energy .",
    "this term only contributes to the real part of the hyperon self  energy and avoids the double counting over intermediate @xmath22 states contained already in the nuclear matter @xmath9-matrix of the hartree - fock contribution @xmath84 .    in summary ,",
    "the self  energy of the hyperon reads @xmath85 with the real part given by @xmath86 and the imaginary part by    @xmath87    the self  energy can then be inserted as a single - particle potential in a schrdinger equation in order to investigate bound and scattering states of a hyperon in a finite nucleus .",
    "the different approximations to the self  energy , i.e. , whether we include the @xmath70 contribution or not , result in different single - particle hamiltonians .",
    "we solve the schrdinger equation by diagonalizing the corresponding single - particle hamiltonian in a complete basis within a spherical box of radius @xmath88 following the procedure outlined in @xcite .",
    "this method is especially suitable fon non - local potentials defined either in coordinate or in momentum space @xcite .",
    "in this section we present and discuss results for @xmath0 and @xmath1 hypernuclei using two realistic interactions : nijmegen soft core @xcite and jlich b @xcite .      as described before , our method provides the binding energies of the different hyperon orbits in finite hypernuclei starting from a @xmath9-matrix calculated in nuclear matter in the @xmath8 center - of - mass frame at fixed starting energy @xmath21 and fermi momentum @xmath89 . by adding the @xmath70 correction to the hartree - fock term one incorporates , up to second order in the nuclear matter @xmath9-matrix , the correct energy dependence and pauli blocking factor in the finite nucleus .",
    "therefore , the complete calculation ( @xmath90 ) has to be viewed as a hartree - fock approach which uses a effective interaction derived microscopically with the appropriate density and energy dependence of the hypernucleus under study .",
    "this is in contrast to previous calculations @xcite where the determination of the finite hypernucleus effective interaction from the nuclear matter @xmath9-matrix implied a sort of average over the nuclear density . in these",
    "works several local and energy independent effective @xmath8 interactions of gaussian form ( @xmath91 ) were derived by parametrizing the corresponding nuclear matter @xmath9-matrices obtained from various @xmath8 potentials .",
    "the parametrization of the @xmath9-matrix into a local effective interaction @xmath91 to be used in finite hypernuclei calculations required the use of an appropiate value of the fermi momentum @xmath89 .",
    "this value was determined , for each nucleus , by averaging the corresponding nuclear density weighted by the modulus squared of the @xmath0 single - particle wave function of the single - particle level under study .",
    "the parameters of the effective @xmath91 interaction were adjusted to reproduce the @xmath0 potential energy @xmath92 in nuclear matter at the average value of @xmath89 . with these parametrizations , @xmath0 single - particle energies and",
    "excited hypernuclear levels in several @xmath0 hypernuclei were obtained through a shell - model calculation , with the aim of learning about the bare @xmath8 interaction .",
    "it therefore seems appropriate to explore , using our method , how much the hyperon single - particle energy depends on the starting energy ( and density ) of the nuclear matter @xmath9-matrix used in the calculation .",
    "this will allow us to assess how reliable energy independent effective interactions obtained from local density averages might be .",
    "let us first show , in fig .",
    "[ fig : binener ] , the binding energy @xmath93 of a @xmath0 ( curves on the left ) or a @xmath1 ( curves on the right ) in nuclear matter at @xmath94 @xmath95 as a function of the starting energy parameter @xmath96 , where @xmath97 mev is an average of the nucleon binding energy over the fermi sea and @xmath98 .",
    "the long - dashed ( full ) lines are for the nijmegen soft core ( jlich b ) interaction .",
    "an estimate of the self - consistent solution is obtained where the line @xmath96 crosses the calculated values of @xmath93 .",
    "this is indicated by the dotted lines in the figure . in the case of the nijmegen interaction",
    "we obtain @xmath99 mev ( @xmath100 mev ) for the @xmath0 and @xmath101 mev ( @xmath102 mev ) for the @xmath1 , whereas , in the case of the jlich interaction , @xmath103 mev for the @xmath0 ( @xmath104 mev ) and @xmath105 mev ( @xmath106 mev ) for the @xmath1 .",
    "several features emerge from fig .",
    "[ fig : binener ] .",
    "first , the @xmath1 hyperon is unrealistically overbound in nuclear matter by the jlich interaction .",
    "it is therefore necessary to readjust the parameters of this interaction if one wants to use it in shell model calculations of @xmath1 hypernuclei .",
    "secondly , we observe that the energy dependence of @xmath107 is slightly stronger in the case of the nijmegen interaction , especially for the @xmath1 hyperon which is more sensitive to the @xmath108 coupling because the starting energy is closer to the energies of the intermediate @xmath109 states ( which propagate with the kinetic energy spectrum ) .",
    "finally , we observe that the @xmath0 binding energy varies at most by 10 mev in a starting energy range of 80 mev , while the variation of the @xmath1 binding amounts to twice as much .",
    "as we will see below , this has consequences in the results for finite hypernuclei .    in tables",
    "[ tab : olambda ] and [ tab : osigma ] we show the binding energy of the @xmath0 and @xmath110 , respectively , in @xmath111o . the columns denoted by @xmath112 correspond to our lowest order calculation ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : hf ] ) ) which uses , as effective interaction , the nuclear matter @xmath9-matrix calculated in the @xmath8 center of mass frame at fixed energy ( shown in the first column ) and density ( @xmath94 @xmath95 ) .",
    "columns labelled @xmath113 include the @xmath70 corrections ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : disprel ] ) and ( [ eq : vc ] ) ) to bring the nuclear matter @xmath9-matrix to the finite nucleus one , with the proper energy and density dependence .",
    "we see that the lowest order results depend quite strongly on the starting energy used , especially in the case of the @xmath1 hyperon as would be expected from the nuclear matter results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : binener ] .",
    "however , it is worth noticing how , no matter what starting energy is used in solving the nuclear matter @xmath9-matrix , the corrected calculation ( @xmath90 ) ends up giving practically the same result for the hyperon binding energy . particularly stable",
    "are the results for the @xmath0 hyperon .",
    "this weaker energy dependence , seen already in the nuclear matter results of fig .",
    "[ fig : binener ] , is due to the fact that the energies involved in the calculation lie further away from the intermediate @xmath8 states , which propagate with kinetic energy , and therefore the strong @xmath114 coupling is less pronounced .    in tables [ tab : dlambda ] and [ tab : dsigma ] we show the binding energy of the @xmath0 and @xmath110 , respectively , in @xmath111o using nuclear matter @xmath9-matrices calculated at several values of the fermi momentum and a fixed value of the starting energy ( @xmath115 for the @xmath0 and @xmath116 for the @xmath1 ) .",
    "the lowest order calculation for the hyperon single - particle energy , shown in the second column , depends quite strongly on the value of @xmath89 .",
    "however , one finds again that , when the @xmath70 correction is included to incorporate the proper intermediate propagator of the finite nucleus , the results nicely converge to practically the same value , no matter what was the density used in the solution of the nuclear matter @xmath9-matrix .",
    "these results are interesting because they confirm that the finite nucleus @xmath47-matrix is already well approximated by the second order term in the expansion in terms of the nuclear matter @xmath9-matrix , see the second and third terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gexpan2 ] ) .",
    "the correction , whose size depends on the starting energy or fermi momentum used in the solution of the nuclear matter @xmath9-matrix , already leads to practically the same value for the hyperon single - particle energy .",
    "higher order terms could only help in bringing the results closer than what they already are .",
    "moreover , our results also show that in some cases the correction is quite appreciable , not only for the @xmath110 binding energies shown in tables [ tab : osigma ] and [ tab : dsigma ] , but also for the @xmath0 energies in the case of the nijmegen interaction . therefore ,",
    "if the correction is taken only approximately through an averaged nuclear matter @xmath9-matrix @xcite it may not lead to the proper effective interaction in the finite nucleus one is studying .",
    "these words of caution are particularly relevant in the case of the @xmath1 hyperon where the corrections are very large .",
    "we note that the @xmath0 single - particle energy obtained in the case of the nijmegen soft core interaction is in excellent agreement with that obtained by halderson ( see column 3 in fig",
    ". 7 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , where the @xmath9-matrix was calculated directly in the finite nucleus for various nijmegen interactions .",
    "our method must be viewed as an alternative way of building up a finite nucleus effective interaction .",
    "it was already shown there that the pauli corrections , which are a source of nucleus dependence , were very large for the nijmegen soft core potential .",
    "this again supports our believe that calculations based on nuclear matter @xmath9-matrices at an average density will carry uncertainties tied to the chosen value of the fermi momentum .",
    "in particular , the whole purpose of using these microscopic calculations to constrain the @xmath8 force can not be achieved if a different value of @xmath89 is used for each @xmath8 interaction when studying the same hypernucleus @xcite .    in the studies of single - particle binding energies below",
    ", we will refrain from a study of the @xmath1 binding energy since the results for @xmath117o give single - particle binding energies which are much too attractive .",
    "several analysis of @xmath118 atomic data @xcite suggest a @xmath1 well depth similar to that of the @xmath0 @xcite and more recent analysis @xcite did not discard @xmath1-nucleus potentials showing an inner repulsion .",
    "moreover , @xmath1 hypernuclear spectra from @xmath6 reactions suggest a relatively shallow @xmath1-nucleus potential @xcite .",
    "therefore , although the amount of data is limited , there is no experimental evidence for such strongly bound @xmath1 hyperons .",
    "this clearly points to a weakness in the present @xmath8 interactions , hinting possibly at a too strong @xmath108 coupling in the interactions .",
    "once the method is well established and tested for the specific case of @xmath119o , it is the right moment to study the systematics of the @xmath0 binding energy through the periodic table . to this end , values of the @xmath0 single - particle binding energies obtained in what has been called @xmath112 and @xmath90 approximations",
    "are reported in table [ tab : ener ] together with the available experimental data .",
    "these binding energies have been calculated using the energy - independent version with parameter set b of the jlich potential @xcite .",
    "the results for the nijmegen soft core potential @xcite have not been considered in this section because the corresponding prediction for the @xmath0 binding energy in nuclear matter is @xmath120 mev , about @xmath121 mev weaker than the prediction of the jlich model ( @xmath122 mev ) which agrees well with the extrapolated experimental values of the single - particle @xmath0 binding energies with increasing mass number .",
    "the agreement with the experimental data is rather good . for convenience in the technicalities of the algorithm",
    "we have always considered hypernuclei with a number of nucleons closing a subshell plus a @xmath0 .",
    "unfortunately , experimental data for those nuclei do not always exist and , as indicated in the table [ tab : ener ] , we have taken the closest representative nucleus for which the experimental information is available .",
    "nevertheless , the differences between the calculated and the experimental values should not be associated to this fact but to the approximations used in the calculation or to the potential itself .    for the density and starting energy used to calculate the @xmath0-nucleon @xmath9-matrix in nuclear matter , which has been used as effective interaction in our finite nucleus calculation , it turns out that the @xmath70 correction is always attractive . as discussed in the previous section ,",
    "if we had used other starting values for the density or the starting energy we would have ended up with different @xmath70 corrections but with the same value for @xmath90 .    in agreement with the experimental information ,",
    "the difference between the @xmath123 and @xmath124 @xmath0 single - particle binding energies associated to these partial waves is very small .",
    "note that the @xmath124 energy is lower than the @xmath123 .",
    "this is a characteristic of the jlich interaction which yeilds too much attraction in the @xmath125 partial wave , as noted already in @xcite where the @xmath126 and @xmath127 states of @xmath128he were calculated and showed to appear in reverse order from the experimental values .",
    "the calculated @xmath0 single - particle energies for @xmath129pb appear clearly overbound with respect to the experimental data .",
    "this is due to the fact that the distortion of the plane wave associated with the nucleon in the intermediate state of the @xmath70 diagram of fig .",

    "energy is non - local both in @xmath24-space and in @xmath142-space . however , in a previous work @xcite we have shown that one can generate a local representation of the self ",
    "energy by performing an appropriate average of the non - local self ",
    "energy @xmath143 , where @xmath53 indicates the quantum numbers of the single - particle state , over the coordinate @xmath144 .",
    "this local representation might , in first approximation , be characterized by the shape of a woods - saxon potential . instead of doing this average , a possible strategy is to assume a woods - saxon shape , fix the depth and the diffusivity independent of the mass number and determine the radius @xmath145 by requiring the woods - saxon potential to reproduce the same eigenvalue than the microscopic non - local energy dependent self  energy . a reasonable value for the depth @xmath133 is the @xmath0 binding energy in nuclear matter , which is taken to be @xmath122 mev , and for the diffusivity @xmath137 fm .",
    "the resulting values of @xmath145 when we apply this procedure to the @xmath12 deepest state of @xmath146c , @xmath10o and @xmath147ca are 2.25 fm , 2.53 fm and 3.82 fm respectively .",
    "fitting these three values with a functional form similar to the one used in ref .",
    "@xcite for the analysis of the experimental data one obtains @xmath148 fm . in order to visualize the quality of these fits ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : ener ] the binding energies for the @xmath12 and @xmath13 waves of @xmath149c , @xmath10o , @xmath147ca and @xmath150zr calculated with our non - local self  energies ( triangles ) together with the values obtained with a woods - saxon potential with the parameters just defined above ( solid lines ) . as the spin - orbit splitting is so small",
    "we have reported the average value of the @xmath123 and @xmath124 energies obtained from the non - local self  energies and have not considered any spin - orbit term in the adjusted woods - saxon potential .",
    "the results of @xmath14pb have not been included in the plot because , as mentioned before , the @xmath12 wave binding energy was larger than the binding energy in nuclear matter which we have taken as the depth of the woods - saxon potential .",
    "the calculated binding energies are well reproduced by the woods - saxon shape and , as expected , both partial waves extrapolate to the binding energy for nuclear matter",
    ".    of course the binding energies are not enough to characterize the single - particle states since potentials giving rise to the same binding energies can generate substantial differences in the corresponding wave functions .",
    "therefore , in order to analyze the microscopically calculated self  energy we should also study the single - particle wave functions .    to have a measure of the goodness of the wave functions generated by the woods - saxon potential , we calculate their overlap with the wave functions obtained by solving the schrdinger equation using the self  energy .",
    "the overlaps for @xmath146c , @xmath10o , @xmath147ca and @xmath150zr are 0.9917 , 0.9869 , 0.9924 and 0.9853 respectively , which are not close enough to 1 to guarantee the equality of the wave functions .",
    "this is visualized in fig .",
    "[ fig : funcs ] , where the wave function for the @xmath12 wave in @xmath10o obtained with the woods - saxon potential ( dashed - line ) is compared with the one obtained directly from the self  energy ( solid line )",
    ".    another possibility would be to keep the diffusivity fixed and adjust the radius @xmath145 and the depth @xmath133 to reproduce the eigenvalue and to maximize the overlap with the eigenfunction provided by the self  energy .",
    "the values of @xmath133 by applying this procedure to the @xmath12 wave of the three lighter nuclei considered above are respectively @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 mev whereas the values of the radius @xmath145 are 2.92 , 3.32 and 4.39 fm . with these values of @xmath133 and @xmath145 the overlaps are 0.9999 for the three nuclei considered .",
    "the eigenfunction obtained by this procedure for the @xmath10o is also drawn in fig .",
    "[ fig : funcs ] ( dot - dashed line ) and shows a large overlap with the self  energy eigenfunction ( solid - line ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "the single - particle energies of closed - shell nuclei with one @xmath0 are well reproduced by using both the microscopic self  energy or the simpler parametrization of woods - saxon type in the schrdinger equation . however , the wave functions provided by the microscopic self  energy differ from the ones originated by a woods - saxon with a fixed depth and diffusivity and a @xmath139-dependent radius . it is important to note that the mean square radius of the self  energy eigenfunction is larger than that from the corresponding woods - saxon wave function",
    ". this can have important consequences in the study the mesonic decay of these @xmath0 hypernuclei .",
    "indeed , it has been observed that the mesonic decay rates of light hypernuclei , such as @xmath154h , @xmath154he and @xmath155he , could be better reproduced if the @xmath0 wave function was pushed out to the surface by the effect of a repulsive hyperon - nucleus potential at short distances .",
    "this would favour the mesonic decay of these hypernuclei because the @xmath0 would be exploring smaller nuclear density regions and the pauli blocking effects , which prevent the mesonic decay from occuring , would be less pronounced .",
    "the mesonic decay rates of light hypernuclei have been calculated using repulsive @xmath0-nucleus potentials at short distances that have been obtained either phenomenologically @xcite , from a quark based bare @xmath8 interaction @xcite or from a microscopic @xmath91 effective interaction folded with an extremely compact @xmath5he density @xcite . at present",
    ", no calculation exists that combines the use of an @xmath8 effective interaction with an appropiate density treatment of the host nucleus .",
    "our method provides such ingredients and has been shown to produce @xmath0 wave functions that are pushed out to the surface .",
    "this is a consequence of the non - localities of the self  energy and might not be related to a repulsive character of the @xmath0-nucleus potential at short distances .",
    "the implications of our results on the mesonic decay of @xmath0 hypernuclei will be explored in a future work .",
    "we have analyzed a method to obtain the effective hyperon - nucleon interaction in finite nuclei based on an expansion over a @xmath9-matrix calculated in nuclear matter at fixed density and starting energy .",
    "the purpose of this study is to set up a reliable frame for hypernuclear structure calculations with the aim of obtaining information about the hyperon - nucleon interaction , complementary to that provided by hyperon - nucleon scattering experiments .",
    "we have shown , by explicit calculation of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 single - particle energies in @xmath111o , that truncating the expansion over the nuclear matter @xmath9-matrix at second order gives results that are very stable against variations of the density and starting energy used in the @xmath9-matrix . moreover ,",
    "both first and second order terms depend quite strongly on those parameters .",
    "this is an indication that the density dependent effects considered when treating explicitly the finite size of the nucleus are very important and , therefore , they might not be well approximated by energy independent and local effective interactions which start from a parametrized nuclear matter @xmath9-matrices evaluated at an average density .",
    "we note that the use of local and density averaged effective interactions can be extremely useful in detecting similarities and differences among the various hyperon - nucleon potentials .",
    "however , if the aim is to fine - tune the bare @xmath8 interactions to reproduce the spectroscopic data of hypernuclei , an appropiate effective interaction for the hypernucleus under study , as the one provided by our method , is in order . in particular ,",
    "the two interactions employed in the present work give rise to very attractive @xmath1 binding energies , while the @xmath156 atomic data and @xmath6 spectra seem to indicate @xmath1-nucleus potential depths similar to that of the @xmath0 or even shallower .",
    "although the method can be viewed as an alternative way of building up a finite nucleus effective interaction , it provides also the complete energy dependence of the hyperon self  energy .",
    "this allows in turn for a study of not only the bound states , as done here , but also the scattering states .",
    "this is especially of interest in the analysis of hypernuclear production reactions which yield a large amount of quasifree hyperons .",
    "we have obtained local woods - saxon @xmath0-nucleus potentials that reproduce the @xmath0 single - particle energies of several hypernuclei .",
    "however , the wave functions obtained from our non - local self  energy are far more extended and can be simulated only when we allow the woods - saxon potential to have an @xmath139-dependent depth and a relatively larger radius .",
    "this can have important implications on the weak mesonic decay of @xmath0 hypernuclei , which will be explored in a future work .",
