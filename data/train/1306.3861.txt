    "the study of charge - parity ( cp ) violation in decays of @xmath9 and @xmath10 mesons have yielded path - breaking results over the past half a century . through these measurements ,",
    "the kobayashi - maskawa paradigm of cp violation has been tested from many directions , and has emerged vindicated so far .",
    "these tests act as indirect probes of new physics beyond the standard model , and so far have not yielded any conclusive evidence for a deviation from the standard model ( sm ) predictions . a positive identification of deviations from the sm is often limited by the uncertainties in the sm predictions themselves , especially in the processes that involve decays of mesons , due to hadronic uncertainties .",
    "the measurements of @xmath11 mixing and the cp violation in @xmath7 decays have started yielding interesting results only in the past decade .",
    "one of the reasons for the @xmath7 decays to have come to the forefront so late is that the mixing as well as cp violation in the @xmath7 sector is expected to be small . in the sm , the contribution to the @xmath11 mixing box diagram",
    "is suppressed  for intermediate @xmath12 and @xmath13 quarks , due to their small masses , and for an intermediate @xmath14 quark , due to the small cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements .",
    "this leads to very small values for both the dispersive as well as absorptive parts of the @xmath11 mixing amplitude .",
    "indeed , the measurements give @xmath15 and @xmath16 to be less than @xmath17 @xcite . moreover , since the phases of the relevant ckm matrix elements are very small , the cp violation is also expected to be not more than @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the sm calculations of the mixing and cp asymmetries in the neutral @xmath7 meson system are difficult due to the mass of the charm quark  it is not light enough to enable the use of the chiral perturbation theory , and not heavy enough to guarantee convergence of the @xmath19 expansion in the heavy quark effective theory .",
    "moreover , the nonperturbative long - distance contributions to the mixing as well as decay amplitudes may be dominant  since the strong coupling is not very small at the scale of the @xmath7 meson mass , and the short - distance contributions do not have the benefit of an intermediate @xmath20 quark as in the case of @xmath10 mesons .",
    "therefore , @xmath7 decays are not a good place for precision measurements of the sm parameters .",
    "however , they can still be used as probes of new physics ( np ) , if the np effects can be large compared to the sm ones @xcite .",
    "modes like @xmath21 and @xmath22 can be sensitive to the presence of such np @xcite .    while the measurements of the mixing parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 are consistent with the sm estimates of @xmath25 @xcite , recent measurements of cp - violating quantities have given us a reason to consider the presence of np contributions .",
    "the cp violation in @xmath26 and @xmath27 decays was constrained by e791 @xcite , focus @xcite , cleo @xcite , and the @xmath10 factories @xcite .",
    "recently cdf @xcite and lhcb @xcite presented the measurements for the `` difference cp asymmetry ''",
    "@xmath28 , the difference between the cp asymmetries in the above two decay modes , that was expected to cancel out some of the systematic uncertainties .",
    "these results , obtained using the pion - tagged samples , indicated a value of @xmath29 for @xmath28 .",
    "these measurements disfavored a vanishing cp asymmetry , and were also away from the sm prediction ( leading order in @xmath30 @xcite ) of @xmath31 by more than @xmath32 .",
    "moreover , the latest lhcb results with the pion - tagged sample @xcite and the muon - tagged sample @xcite have central values with opposite signs , and differ by @xmath33 from each other .",
    "the average of these two lhcb measurements has also been recently reported @xcite , which is consistent with vanishing @xmath34 .",
    "( however as we shall point out in this paper , such an average need not be the right observable to look for . )",
    "several attempts have been made to check if the observed large cp asymmetries can be accommodated within the sm .",
    "it has been claimed that qcd penguin operators , with large strong phases , may give rise to a significant enhancement @xcite .",
    "the breaking of @xmath35 @xcite , or @xmath36-spin @xcite symmetries , or of the naive @xmath37 counting @xcite may also be a reason for the observed large @xmath28 .",
    "however the jury is still out on whether these contributions can account for the data without the need to go beyond the sm .",
    "specific np models that can enhance the cp asymmetries have also been extensively studied .",
    "these include the fourth quark generation @xcite , supersymmetric gluino - squark loops @xcite , littlest higgs model with t - parity @xcite , flavor violation in the up sector @xcite , models with a color - sextet diquark @xcite , models giving rise to the @xmath20-channel exchange of a weak doublet with a special flavor structure @xcite , the nonmanifest left - right symmetric model @xcite , or models with warped extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "a survey of the effect of np models that may contribute to the difference cp asymmetry has been performed in ref .",
    "it points out that the cp violation may be generated at the tree level with models that involve flavor - changing couplings of @xmath38 bosons , new charged gauge bosons , flavor - changing heavy gluon , scalar octets , a scalar diquark , or a two - higgs doublet with minimal flavor violation .",
    "models with gim - unsuppressed fermion and scalar loops , or those with chirally enhanced magnetic penguin operators , can also contribute to the cp asymmetry at the loop level .",
    "it has been observed @xcite that np models in which the primary source of flavor violation is linked to the breaking of chiral symmetry are natural candidates to explain the cp asymmetries , via enhanced chromomagnetic operators .",
    "many of these models also affect the measurements of other @xmath7 decay channels , as well as the @xmath11 mixing and @xmath39 in the @xmath9 sector , and hence the masses of new particles and couplings in most of these models are severely constrained @xcite .    identifying whether the enhancement in the cp violation in @xmath40 is from the sm or np is not straightforward ; however , some information may be obtained from related decay modes .",
    "it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that , since the enhancement due to nonperturbative physics should only affect exclusive modes , an enhancement in the inclusive modes will point definitively to np .",
    "one could also look at modes related to @xmath41 by isospin symmetry , since this symmetry is not expected to be broken significantly .",
    "such a comparison could distinguish between a large penguin amplitude and an enhanced chromomagnetic dipole operator , for example ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is not to check whether the sm or any specific np model explains the data .",
    "rather , we choose to take the data at face value , and learn in a model - independent way what they tell us about the cp violation in the @xmath11 mixing and decay . to this end",
    ", we perform a fit to the data with four complex parameters , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . here , the mixing parameters @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the complex - valued dispersive and absorptive components , respectively , of the effective @xmath11 mixing hamiltonian . the other two parameters , @xmath46 are the ratios of decay amplitudes of a pure @xmath47 and @xmath7 to the cp eigenstates .",
    "the data on @xmath11 mixing and cp asymmetries in the @xmath48 and @xmath49 channels form the main input for the fit .",
    "the ingredients for the fit also include the asymmetries @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , constructed from the ratios of effective lifetimes measured in the cp - eigenstate modes @xmath54 , and the ( almost-)flavor - specific modes @xmath55 @xcite , which have been reported by focus @xcite , cleo @xcite , belle @xcite , babar @xcite , and lhcb @xcite . while the measurements of @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are consistent with zero to within @xmath56 , the asymmetry @xmath53 has been found to be nonzero to more than @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "more recently , belle @xcite and babar @xcite have reported values of @xmath58 and @xmath59 averaged over the @xmath48 and @xmath49 samples , where the @xmath60 has been found to be nonzero to more than @xmath61 in each experiment . these asymmetries may be represented in terms of the combinations of the same parameters considered above , hence the information content in these measurements is also relevant in determining the favored parameter values , and in fact , is commonly used @xcite .",
    "the classification of cp violation in neutral meson systems is normally described in two languages .",
    "one may talk in terms of cp violation in only mixing ( deviation of @xmath62 from unity ) , in only decay ( deviation of @xmath63 from unity , where @xmath64 ) , and in the interference of mixing and decay ( imaginary part of @xmath65 ) .",
    "this is the standard notation used in the discussion of @xmath10 decays . on the other hand",
    ", one may use the language of direct vs. indirect cp violation , which has its origins in the analyses of @xmath9 decays .",
    "while we personally prefer the former formulation due to its clarity in distinguishing the source of the cp violation , the latter one has been used in most of the literature on the cp asymmetries in @xmath7 decays that is the focus of this paper .",
    "indeed , the recent experimental data @xcite have been interpreted in terms of the direct and indirect cp asymmetries ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively ) in the @xmath68 and @xmath69 decays .",
    "we therefore shall refer to both the notations , at the risk of some repetition in presenting our results and interpretations .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath28 in terms of its direct and indirect components often @xcite takes @xmath70 .",
    "we point out that if this condition were strictly valid , it would also imply @xmath71 , independent of the origin of the cp asymmetry .",
    "this is clearly not the case , even in the limit of flavor @xmath35 where these two quantities have the same magnitudes but opposite signs .",
    "therefore , the assumption of exactly equal @xmath67 in the @xmath8 and @xmath72 channels is , strictly speaking , not accurate . in practice , with certain `` natural '' expectations about the amplitudes and phases of np contributions ,",
    "the nonuniversality of @xmath67 may turn out to be so small that it may be neglected @xcite , since the difference @xmath73 is less than @xmath74 and is expected to contribute to the nonuniversality @xmath70 only to the second order .",
    "however , while searching for physics beyond the sm , the analysis of data should be performed without prejudice to theoretical expectations , and alternative scenarios , however unlikely they may seem , should be considered .",
    "we therefore reanalyze the current data without the approximation @xmath70 .",
    "our fit , in fact , shows that the preferred parameter space allows significantly different values for @xmath67 in @xmath48 and @xmath49 decays .",
    "such a difference could also contribute to the seemingly different @xmath2 values measured through the pion - tagged and muon - tagged data samples at the lhcb @xcite .",
    "that this nonuniversality also leads to the nonuniversality of @xmath58 and @xmath59 has been indirectly alluded to in ref .",

    "[ analytic ] , we present the analytical expressions for the time - dependent cp asymmetries and their direct and indirect components , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , inferred from the data .",

    "[ numerical ] , we perform a @xmath75 fit to the data and obtain the favored values for the parameters of interest .",

    "section  [ concl ] summarizes our results and recommends taking the possible nonuniversality in @xmath67 into account for future analyses of neutral @xmath7 decay data .",
    "we follow the analysis of @xmath11 mixing and decay as in refs .  @xcite . since the notations vary from analysis to analysis , we repeat the relevant steps to clarify our notation . in the @xmath76 flavor basis , the effective hamiltonian @xmath77 is not diagonal . the off - diagonal elements of the dispersive and absorptive components , i.e. @xmath44 and @xmath45 , are responsible for the @xmath11 mixing .",

    "it is therefore important that the measurements of @xmath165 and @xmath53 be available separately , without averaging over the @xmath48 and @xmath49 modes , and analyzed without the assumption of their equality .",
    "our analysis as such does not depend on whether we have only sm , or whether np is present in addition .",
    "however within the sm , even given the uncertainties due to long - distance contributions , it is very difficult to get cp violation of the order of @xmath114 or larger .",
    "indeed , if @xmath62 actually differs substantially from unity , it will need a large phase difference between @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which does not seem possible in the sm . also , getting significantly different phases for the quantities @xmath181 and @xmath43 , as indicated by the data ,",
    "is not something the sm can do .",
    "we therefore interpret our results in terms of the demands they make on np models , and the observations required for identifying such np . to compare our results with previous analyses , here we present our arguments in terms of the language and notation used in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the notation of the particle data group @xcite , the decay amplitudes @xmath182 and @xmath183",
    "[ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : af - abarf ] ) ] are written as @xmath184 \\ ; , \\nonumber \\\\ \\bar{a}_f & = & a_f^t ~ e^{- i \\phi_f^t } \\left [ 1 + r_f ~ e^{i ( \\delta_f - \\phi_f ) }   \\right ] \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath185 is the leading tree amplitude with its corresponding phase @xmath186 , while @xmath187 is the ratio of the subleading to the leading amplitude , with the corresponding strong and weak phase differences @xmath188 and @xmath189 , respectively .",
    "this notation may be matched to ours by using r_f = = e^-2 i _ f^t . the approximation @xmath190 used in @xcite leads to universal indirect cp violation ( @xmath191 ) that is independent of @xmath192 and @xmath189 . as a result , the quantities @xmath58 and @xmath59 are also universal , i.e. identical for the @xmath48 and @xmath49 modes .",
    "although the approximation @xmath193 is valid in the sm , it is not guaranteed to be true in the presence of np .",
    "higher - order terms in @xmath187 give nonuniversal contributions to @xmath67 through different values for @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath187 is bounded by the cp violation measurements themselves : since @xmath194 , we have @xmath195 , and hence @xmath196 , for both the decay modes . on the other hand , in order to have a significant nonuniversality in @xmath67 through @xmath197 , we need @xmath198 , since our fit suggests equal magnitudes for these two quantities ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda ] . using the results in @xcite ,",
    "the relevant nonuniversality may be expressed in terms of ( _ k ) - arg ( _ ) 2 r___- 2 r_k _ k _ k , so that at least one of the two quantities @xmath199 should be significantly large , i.e. @xmath200 . for both the above constraints to be satisfied simultaneously , we need @xmath201 , @xmath202 , and @xmath203 , for at least one of the final states @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the above argument suggests that for the condition implied by our best - fit point to be met , one needs an enhanced subleading amplitude with a large relative weak phase and a small relative small phase compared to the leading term , for at least one of the two final states .",
    "while the first two conditions may be generically satisfied by a np model that is not too constrained from other measurements , the smallness of the relative strong phase may seem to be rather fine - tuned , since the np operators typically differ from the leading ones in their color and chirality structure @xcite .",
    "explicit calculations or direct measurements of these strong phase differences are not available ; recent analysis of the @xmath68 scattering data in the context of sm @xcite indicates large strong phases , but note that what is needed here is a small _ difference _ in the strong phases of the leading and subleading contributions . on the other hand",
    ", the magnitude and phase of the np contribution should conspire such that @xmath110 to within @xmath114 .",
    "the np scenario required here is thus rather fine - tuned , but is not ruled out , and hence should not be ignored .",
    "further , note that if the difference between the lhcb measurements with the pion - tagged and muon - tagged samples is real , this is perhaps the only mechanism that can account for it .",
    "in fact , the measurement of nonuniversality of @xmath67 itself would give direct information on the smallness or largeness of this phase that appears in all the cp - violating observables .",
    "the np scenario described above , which gives large nonuniversality in @xmath67 , is mandated if the best - fit point obtained from our fit indeed turns out to be the right one with future data .",
    "however even if the future data were to indicate smaller nonuniversality in @xmath67 than the best - fit point obtained our fit , our analysis in sec .",
    "[ analytic ] still stays relevant .",
    "it gives generalized expressions for the cp asymmetry @xmath204 and the related quantities @xmath205 [ see eqs .",
    "( [ cpdir ] ) , ( [ cpindir ] ) , ( [ eq : agamma ] ) , ( [ eq : ycp ] ) ] that are valid even with nonuniversal @xmath67 .",
    "the expressions prevalent in the standard literature @xcite do not take this possibility into account .",
    "the nonuniversality of @xmath58 and @xmath59 has been explicitly calculated in @xcite , albeit with different expansion parameters than the ones considered here .",
    "we believe that our expansion parameters ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) are more well motivated since they have been measured to be small .",
    "moreover , while obtaining the final expression for @xmath28 , ref .",
    "@xcite used the assumption of universality of the phase of @xmath112 , thus restricting its domain of validity .",
    "the recent measurements of the cp asymmetries in @xmath206 modes , and the difference in the cp asymmetries in these modes ( the so - called difference cp asymmetry ) have yielded values differing from the sm expectations . moreover , the difference cp asymmetries measured at the lhcb through the pion - tagged and the muon - tagged samples differ substantially .",
    "we examine these data in a model - independent manner to discern the nature of cp violation involved therein and to find a resolution for the above discrepancy .    by performing a fit to the data on @xmath11 mixing , cp asymmetries in @xmath54 modes , as well as the related quantities @xmath58 and @xmath59 in these channels , we find the following : ( i ) the cp violation through decay - only in both the modes is restricted to be less than @xmath29 , although this limit still allows values much larger than those permitted by the sm .",
    "( ii ) the cp violation through mixing - only , on the other hand , can be quite large  the value of @xmath62 can differ from unity by @xmath207 .",
    "( iii ) the cp violation through the mixing - decay interference may play an important role in the @xmath54 modes .",
    "the phases of the quantities @xmath208 and @xmath209 tend to differ substantially .    in the language of direct and indirect cp asymmetries ,",
    "as used while presenting the recent experimental data , the direct cp asymmetries in both , @xmath48 and @xmath49 modes is restricted to be less than @xmath29 , and these two asymmetries can have different values .",
    "the indirect cp asymmetries in these two modes also can differ substantially in certain scenarios .",
    "indeed we demonstrate that , mathematically speaking , different direct cp asymmetries imply different indirect cp asymmetries , unless there are accidental cancellations .",
    "we therefore emphasize that taking the indirect cp asymmetries in these two channels to be equal is an approximation , one that may be valid , but that should be checked with data .",
    "it turns out that the possibility of nonuniversal indirect cp asymmetry also allows a partial reconciliation between the seemingly different difference cp asymmetries measured through the pion - tagged and muon - tagged samples at the lhcb .",
    "the analyses for these decay modes in terms of the direct and indirect cp asymmetries should therefore be performed without the usual assumption of equal indirect cp asymmetries in the two modes .",
    "our formalism also allows us to express the quantities @xmath58 and @xmath59 in a symmetric form , @xmath210 and @xmath211 , without having to assume equal magnitudes as well as phases for @xmath212 for the @xmath48 and @xmath49 channels .",
    "this also indicates that the data on these quantities in the @xmath48 and @xmath49 channels should be presented separately , since these quantities can be different in these two modes and an averaging might lose information critical for ascertaining the presence and nature of any np present .",
    "a significant nonuniversality in @xmath67 would require the subdominant amplitude in @xmath96 decay to be comparable in magnitude to the dominant one , as well as a small strong relative phase and a large weak relative phase between these two amplitudes .",
    "this scenario appears fine - tuned , given the theoretical expectation of large relative strong phases ; however , there is no direct calculation or measurement of the strong phase , so it is not ruled out .",
    "therefore , it is important to take into account the possibility of such a np that could give rise to significant nonuniversality in @xmath67 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 . the generalized analysis and expressions presented in this paper then need to be used instead of the ones in standard literature that assume universality of @xmath67 .",
    "indeed , such a generalized analysis will be useful in measuring the extent of the nonuniversality itself , and testing of the theoretical expectation of a large strong relative phase .",
    "since using the generalized analysis ( by removing just one assumption ) offers the possibility of explaining the current data as well as probing np signals with future data , this opportunity should not be missed .",
    "this implies that the averaging of @xmath205 values in @xmath41 modes at the b factories , as well as the averaging of @xmath28 in pion - tagged and muon - tagged modes in lhcb , should be avoided . with large amounts of data around the corner from the lhc upgrade and the super - b factory",
    ", statistics will cease to be the limiting factor , and one can probe possible np in the cp violation in @xmath7 decays in a clean way .",
    "while this article was under review , the lhcb collaboration announced undated results on @xmath58 @xcite : @xmath213 , @xmath214 . adding these measurements to our fit",
    ", we find that ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : scatter_rev ] ) the ability of nonuniversal-@xmath67 to help reconcile the @xmath28 measurements through the pion - tagged and muon - tagged samples at the lhcb is rather restricted by the new data .",
    "however the last word on the cp violation in @xmath7 meson system is yet to be written @xcite , and a complete analysis should take into account the possibility of different indirect cp asymmetries in the @xmath8 and @xmath6 channels .",
