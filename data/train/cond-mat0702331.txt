    "the two - temperature model ( ttm ) describes a non - equilibrium state between electrons and the lattice .",
    "when an electric field is applied to a metallic sample or the sample is photoexcited by a laser pulse , a state of non - equilibrium arise between electrons and the lattice .",
    "since the time required to establish equilibrium in the electron gas ( degenerate fermi distribution ) is much less than the time required to establish equilibrium between the electrons and the lattice phonons , the metal can be considered as composed of interacting subsystems , one electrons and other phonons .",
    "the hot degenerate ( thermalized ) electron gas relaxes to the bath phonons with relatively slow electron - phonon interactions .",
    "this problem was solved by v. l. ginzburg and v. p. shabanskii ( 1955)@xcite in high temperature limit ( @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the debye temperature ) . the complete solution for arbitrary temperatures",
    "was given by kaganov , lifshitz and tanatarov ( 1956)@xcite .",
    "they considered the weakly coupled electron and phonon subsystems and ignored the band structure of the metal , this work was further extended to the case of a metal exposed to ultrashort laser pulses@xcite , and today known as ttm .",
    "it is a pioneering work , that provides the basic model for ultra - fast pump - probe laser studies in metals@xcite .",
    "the theory of thermal relaxation of electrons in metals was further extended by p. b. allen@xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that ttm can be derived from d. n. zubarev s non - equilibrium statistical operator ( nso ) method@xcite by systematic approximations , with this , one can obtain even more advanced results than ttm including the non - markovian effects@xcite .",
    "nso method is based on a generalization of gibbs method of equilibrium states to non - equilibrium states .",
    "gibbs equilibrium statistical mechanics is based upon the deep connection between additive integrals of motion ( most common is energy ) and the invariance of phase space distribution function due to liouvelle theorem .",
    "this idea has been generalized to the non - equilibrium states by d. n. zubarev using the concept of local quasi - integrals of motion and n. n. bogolyubov s idea of a hierarchy of relaxation times i.e. , evolution of the system from far - from - equilibrium stage to kinetic stage and then to the hydrodynamic stage as time proceeds . in our context of non - equilibrium electron - phonon system",

    "the second aim of this paper is to point out new open problems about non - equilibrium electron relaxation in metallic nano - systems(see last paragraph of section iii b ) , and also in bulk systems ( beyond ttm , section iv ) .",
    "we also give a simple stochastic model to describe relaxation phenomena in non - equilibrium , non - degenerate ( non - boltzmann ) electronic subsystem .",
    "the adjective `` non - boltzmann '' signifies that the gas is in non - equilibrium condition even in the classical approximation .",
    "we emphasis both aspects ( namely , modified ttm for nano - systems using first principles and beyond ttm i.e. , a general stochastic model ) of the relaxation problem .",

    "_ is introduced and clarified .",

    "the terms non - degenerate , non - fermi - dirac , or non - thermalized electron distribution has been used in the literature , all have the same meaning , and point to the same physical condition of the electrons , but here , we adopt the term `` non - thermalized electron distribution '' for the sake of a unified presentation .",

    "the question regarding the weight of the two factors , namely , surface to volume ratio ( geometric factor ) , and reduction of electron phonon screening , in the thermalization of hot electron distribution is still open .",
    "as discussed in section ii , ttm assumes `` instantaneous '' thermalization of non - thermal electron distribution to a hot fermi distribution , and then this hot fermi distribution cools through electron - phonon interactions with the phonon subsystem .",
    "the assumption of `` instantaneous thermalization '' or `` adiabatic assumption '' is , in general , not in agreement with experimental observations@xcite , when one probe the system with very short and multi - wavelength laser pulses @xmath104 .",

    "is given by sun etal@xcite , which is quite successful in explaining qualitatively the main features of the relaxation mechanism , and it is in agreement with experimental observations ( typical pump - probe experiments ) and numerical solutions of the boltzmann equation .",
    "the model is applicable in the perturbative regime , where the system s response is linear and the measured changes in the reflectivity of the sample ( thin gold films of thickness @xmath105 ) can be related to the changes in electron distribution .",
    "the main idea is that the transient reflection or transmission of the sample is proportional to the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric constant , which is further related to the changes in the electron distribution  through joint density of states  due to a model developed by rosei etal@xcite .",
    "thus , in the linear perturbative regime , by knowing about transient reflectivity or transmissivity of the sample one can study the changes in the electron distribution .",

    "the first principle model has to face the problem of non - equilibrium electron distributions , a part of the main problem of the non - equilibrium statistical mechanics itself . a possible way to",
    "the solution is to use d. n. zubarev s non - equilibrium statistical operator method as mentioned in the introduction . but",

    "also , the possibly dissipative electron - electron interaction has to be interpreted in terms of the coulomb interaction as screened by the dissipative polarization of the lattice .",
    "while , our generalization of the stochastic granular gas model to the electronic system covers time - dependent process relevant to the transient femtosecond photoexcitation , we have actually treated the steady state electron distribution under the cw(continuous wave ) drive .",
    "this stochastic generalized model describes the scattering events for time less than @xmath119 which could be quite large for the case of strong electron - phonon couplings .",
    "so , this model is quite general one .",

    "similarly , the electron - phonon scattering rate is given by @xmath130 , with @xmath131 as the number of thermal phonons in the phonon - energy shell @xmath127 . here , the fraction @xmath132 determines the relative strengths of the binary electron - electron and the electron - phonon collisions .",
    "also , let the electrons are photoexcited at energy @xmath133 above the fermi energy at a rate @xmath134 , and then recombine ( deplete ) from the non - degenerate distribution through recombination .",
    "this depletion rate can be modelled by a term @xmath135 . here",
    ", fermi energy is set equal to zero for simplicity .",
    "the phonons are assumed to remain in thermal equilibrium at temperatures @xmath9 . for non - degenerate electronic subsystem energy to be the only label for the single particle states .",
    "the photo - excitation is taken to be homogenous over the sample , which is reasonable for a nanoscale metallic sample . for the above dissipative model driven far from equilibrium , the kinetics for the non - equilibrium electron number density @xmath136 is given by the rate equation @xmath137\\gamma   \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\int_0 ^ 1 dz p(z ) \\int de^\\prime \\int de^{\\prime\\prime } \\delta(e - z\\alpha ( e^{\\prime}+ e^{\\prime\\prime}))n_e(e^\\prime)n_e(e^{\\prime\\prime})(1-f)\\gamma \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\int_0 ^ 1 dz p(z ) \\int de^\\prime\\int de^{\\prime\\prime } \\delta(e - z ( e^{\\prime}+ e^{\\prime\\prime}))n_e(e^{\\prime})n_{ph}(e^{\\prime\\prime})f\\gamma \\nonumber \\\\ & & + g_{ex}(t)\\delta(e - e_{ex})-g_d\\delta(e)n_e(0).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the above",
    ", we have assumed the total energy @xmath138 for a binary collision to be partitioned such that a fraction @xmath139 , with probability density @xmath140 , goes to the _ tagged _ electron of initial energy @xmath141 , and @xmath142 to the colliding particle ( electron or phonon of initial energy @xmath143 ) .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath62 in the electron - electron collision takes care of the possibility of inelastic electron - electron collisions .",
    "note that we have suppressed the time argument ( @xmath144 ) in the non - equilibrium electron - number density @xmath136 .",
    "taking the energy laplace transform @xmath145 of eq.(36 ) , we obtain , @xmath146+(1-f ) \\gamma",

    "a pulsed excitation can , of course , be considered in general .",
    "accordingly , we set @xmath148 above , and all quantities on the r.h.s . of eq.(38 ) are then independent of time . in order to calculate the steady - state electron distribution for the system in terms of the bath ( phonon ) temperature and other rate parameters",
    ", we expand @xmath149 in powers of the laplace - transform parameter @xmath150 as @xmath151 and equate the co - efficients of like powers of @xmath150 .",
    "thus , from the zeroth power of s , we obtain at once @xmath152 similarly , from the first power of s , we get , @xmath153}.\\ ] ] in the above , we have taken a uniform limit for the energy partition : @xmath154 .    here",
    ", we have defined @xmath155 mean electron energy ; @xmath156 mean phonon energy @xmath157 ; and @xmath158 electron - to- phonon number ratio .",
    "it is to be noted that in the limit @xmath159 ( _ i.e. , _ for elastic electron - electron collisions as is usually expected for an electronic system unlike the case of the granular gas ) , and @xmath160 ( _ i.e. , _ no photo - excitation ) , we recover @xmath161 , _",
    "i.e. , _ the electrons and the phonons are at the same temperature , as is physically expected under equilibrium conditions . in general , however , the mean electron energy in the steady state is not the same as the mean phonon energy , and the former depends on the excitation rate ( the drive @xmath162 ) .",
    "the phenomenological integro - differential equation ( eq.38 ) is a general result .",
    "note that in ( eq.38 ) , the probability @xmath140 can be any ` collision distribution ' function .",
    "this kinetic equation can be solved by numerical simulations with specific choice of parameters .",
    "the important aspect of this stochastic model is that it describes the kinetics in non - degenerate electronic sub - system , because in this regime microscopic calculation for non - equilibrium distribution functions are complex , and no simple model is available .",
    "our simple stochastic model gives a partial solution to the problem .",
    "the present paper reviews the two - temperature model based on boltzmann - bloch - peierls kinetic equation .",
    "its approximate validity is justified due to the fact that , in an excited metal , the intra - electron and intra - phonon relaxation time scales are much much less than the inter - electron - phonon relaxation time scales . in spite of the success of ttm in bulk case",
    ", it can not be directly applied to spatially restricted systems , because of the non - resonant nature of the interaction between bulk phonons and the electrons .",
    "the main channel of energy relaxation is through electron surface - phonon interaction .",
    "problems can be solved by considering surface effects , as explained in section iii .",
    "we have seen ( from the discussions in section iv ) that ttm fails when one probe the sample with very short laser pulses ( pulse width in the femto - second regime ) , and the non - thermal electron distribution has been experimentally observed . in this regard",
    ", we explained the rate - equation model of sun etal and presented a stochastic kinetic model to describe the kinetics of non - thermal part of the electron distribution .",
    "so we see that ttm is an approximation of bbp kinetic equation .",
    "in fact , bbp approach also has its own limited validity , it is valid for a rarefied electron gas and in the first born approximation .",
    "its success here lies in the fact that conduction electrons in metals can be treated free . for a general non - equilibrium electron - phonon system ,",
    "non - equilibrium statistical operator method should give us more profound results , that will go beyond all the cases considered here .",
