    "here , we show that a uniform dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction along chains but staggered between chains can explain that the dynamical structure factor @xmath73 leads to an esr signal and that there is , consequently , a nontrivial mode b.    the symmetry of the crystal structure of dimpy ( fig .  1 of the main manuscript ) allows the occurrence of a uniform dm interaction along the leg , but staggered from leg to leg @xmath74 that corresponds to the term @xmath46 of the hamiltonian ( 1 ) in the main text .",

    "according to the identity , in the absence of the dm interaction ( i.e. , @xmath86 ) , one finds a single mode at @xmath87 , which is mode a. the esr mode b is absent unless anisotropic interactions breaking the spin - rotational symmetry are present .",
    "the identity also shows that mode b comes from the last term , the retarded green s function @xmath88 .",

    "<S> the former contribution is characteristic of the tll state and is commonly found in spin-1/2 heisenberg chains ( and can be interpreted as originating from the bose condensate of @xmath68 magnons ) , while the latter have @xmath69 magnons as their origin . </S>",
