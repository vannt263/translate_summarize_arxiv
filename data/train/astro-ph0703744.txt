    "there are four stress - energy components in the presently preferred standard cosmological model  @xcite : the baryons which constitute the visible universe , radiation ( photons and neutrinos ) , cold dark matter ( cdm ) and some unknown component , often called dark energy , which gives rise to the cosmic acceleration  @xcite . within the codes",
    "@xcite used to make predictions for specific models , the cdm is modelled as a pressureless , perfect fluid and the radiation components are modelled as black - body radiation gases . however , many of the qualitative features of the observed power spectra , for example , the acoustic peaks in the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , can be derived by ignoring the higher order moments of the photon and neutrino distributions and treating them as a perfect fluid with @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the pressure and @xmath2 is the density . hence , most of the important components of the universe are well approximated by perfect fluids .",
    "the microphysical origin of the cosmic acceleration is still a mystery .",
    "the simplest , and probably most popular , explanation is a cosmological constant , although this has some well documented fine - tuning problems  @xcite .",
    "various ideas exist , collectively known as dark energy ( for a recent review of dark energy models , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , whereby the additional stress - energy component is provided by a slowly rolling scalar field  @xcite , known as as quintessence , or a lattice of topological defects  @xcite .",
    "alternative explanations require the modification of gravity by the inclusion of non - minimal coupling between matter and gravity  @xcite , extra - dimensions ( for example , ref .",
    "@xcite ) and modifications to the einstein - hilbert action  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we shall consider a generalization of the perfect continuum fluid approach to describe dark energy .",
    "we have already pointed out that perfect fluids can be used to describe the essential properties of the radiation and cdm in the universe , and it seems reasonable to consider the possibility that the dark energy can also be understood in the same way .",
    "this will require us to go back to the fundamentals of how formulate a generalized continuum medium in general relativity and derive equations for the perturbations in the medium .",
    "these are essential in computing accurate predictions for observed power spectra  @xcite",
    ". we will show that the most obvious generalization of a perfect fluid is to allow for rigidity of the medium in a way analogous to a continuum elastic solid  @xcite , and that this can be stable if the rigidity is sufficiently large even if the pressure is negative . for most cosmological observations ( for example",
    ", the cmb or large - scale structure measurements ) we only need to consider the linearized regime .",
    "we will argue that the generalization of fluids to include rigidity , is the most general possibility for an adiabatic medium at linearized order .    in many ways",
    "the concept of dark energy is similar to the idea of the aether postulated in the late 19th century : there is something about the laws of physics which appears awry and we postulate a medium to try and solve the problem  .",
    "the approach we propose is to formulate generalized properties of such a medium , define ways of computing power spectra and then compare them with observations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the status of this kind of model after the first year wmap data ) .",
    "the idea of generalized dark matter / energy has been considered previously by a number of authors  @xcite .",
    "we will attempt to discuss how the approaches suggested by others relate to those presented here .",
    "the broad difference between our approach and those taken previously is that we will derive the equations describing perturbations in the medium from a set of well defined physical assumptions .",
    "these equations are closed and there is no freedom , except the strength of the rigidity , to play with .",
    "the original derivation of the equations presented here  @xcite , was motivated by the idea that the dark energy could be a lattice of topological defects ( cosmic strings or domain walls ) formed at a low energy phase transition .",
    "we will explain how such a lattice can provide a possible microphysical model for an elastic dark energy model .",
    "however , we believe that the formulation of the elastic dark energy models is more general and should not be thought of as being necessarily linked to these specific type of models which predict very specific values for @xmath3 .",
    "in particular , the elastic dark energy models include cdm and a cosmological constant as limiting cases allowing them to provide an interesting phenomenology .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : dynamics ] we discuss the formulation of a generalized medium and derive the equations of motion .",
    "we then go on to identify the various adiabatic and isocurvature modes in section  [ sec : sdemodes ] and present the cosmological signatures expected in the cmb and matter power spectra in section  [ sec : cosmo ] . in section  [ sec : micro ]",
    "we explain the basic ideas of defect - dominated scenarios for dark energy and explain how they relate to the elastic dark energy models .",
    "in section  [ sec : materialspace ] we review the medium representation concept and the scheme for specifying perturbations in a general medium . in",
    "[ sec : cosmoeqns ] we apply this formalism to compute the cosmological equations of motion for an isotropic elastic medium and in  [ sec : evalsound ] evaluate the propagation speeds of perturbations .",
    "we then decompose the perturbations in terms of harmonic basis functions in  [ sec : harmdecomp ] and  [ sec : svt_split ] to give the full set of einstein and energy - momentum conservation equations . in section  [ sec : genfluid ]",
    "we compare our results to other treatments of generalized fluids , and in  [ sec : aniso ] discuss briefly how the formalism can be applied to anisotropic perturbations .",
    "this section provides an overview of work on relativistic elastic media in the context of neutrons stars by carter and others  @xcite , and details how this elegant formalism to describe the mechanics of a generalized medium can be applied to cosmology . in newtonian",
    "theory it is natural to define the properties of a medium , such as the density and pressure , in terms of coordinates of a three - dimensional euclidean space at some given instant of time . in general relativity",
    ", however , there is no general time - slicing of the four - dimensional space - time manifold @xmath4 which can be used to specify the material state .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to consider the projection @xmath5 : @xmath6 of @xmath4 onto a three - dimensional manifold @xmath7 whose elements represent particles of the medium  @xcite . the inverse image @xmath8 of a point @xmath9 can then interpreted as the worldline of the particle represented by @xmath10 .",
    "the inverse image determines a one - to - one mapping between medium tensors defined on @xmath7 and the set of tensors on @xmath4 which are orthogonal to the congruence of wordlines .",
    "this mapping is important as it allows the intrinsic properties of the material medium to be defined on @xmath7 , whilst the spacetime evolution is described by tensor fields on @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , it allows the definition of spacetime tensors in terms the tensors defined on @xmath7 .",
    "we will use greek indices @xmath11 to label tensors on @xmath4 and roman indices @xmath12 to label tensors on @xmath7 .",
    "we define @xmath13 to be the metric on @xmath7 which quantifies the strain of the medium . at each point of @xmath7",
    ", we will assume that there are functions determining the density @xmath2 and pressure @xmath14 which can be expressed in terms of @xmath13 ( one of the properties of a perfect medium ) and , most probably , related by an equation of state @xmath15 . under these assumptions",
    "one can show that @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the determinant of @xmath18 , and by taking a second derivative of @xmath2 with respect to @xmath18 , one can define @xmath19 the classical elasticity tensor which satisfies @xmath20 .",
    "we will see that defining these two tensors is sufficient to understand linearized perturbations of the medium .    in order to make correspondence with the spacetime @xmath4",
    ", we define @xmath21 to be a bi - tensorial projection operator which projects a tensor in @xmath7 into @xmath4 , or vice - versa , then one can define the projected metric tensor @xmath22 by @xmath23 the field of flow vectors @xmath24 tangent to wordlines in @xmath4 are normalized by the condition @xmath25 and the projection is orthogonal to them , that is , @xmath26 .",
    "this allows us to construct @xmath22 as an orthogonal projection tensor @xmath27 providing an alternative , but equivalent , definition for @xmath22 .",
    "it acts as the tensor which projects other tensors onto the tangent subspace orthogonal to the wordlines .",
    "for example , any vector @xmath28 can then be decomposed into components orthogonal and parallel to the flow by @xmath29 , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "this allows physically relevant spacetime tensors to be decomposed into the parallel component , which does not contribute to the material projection , and the orthogonal part , which does .",
    "this framework is summarized schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : matflow ] .",
    "one can use the projection tensor to construct the spacetime pressure tensor , @xmath32 , from that on @xmath7 @xmath33 which satisfies @xmath34 .",
    "the same can be done for the elasticity tensor @xmath35 which satisfies @xmath36    one must also specify how perturbations in @xmath7 are related to those in @xmath4 in order to deal with dynamics .",
    "the convected differential @xmath37 $ ] is an important quantity , as it is the spacetime tensor corresponding to the lagrangian ( wordline preserving ) material variation on @xmath7 . in the case of a vector , there is the bijection @xmath38 \\longleftrightarrow \\ { { \\delta_{\\rm l}}\\ , _ \\perp \\ ! v^{\\rm a } , \\ , { \\delta_{\\rm l}}v^{\\parallel } \\}$ ] , where @xmath39 is the lagrangian variation . the convected differential can be evaluated in terms of lagrangian differentials on @xmath4 by projecting the orthogonal part of the perturbation .",
    "this gives the explicit relationship  @xcite @xmath40 = { \\delta_{\\rm l}}t^{\\mu ... }_{\\nu ... }+t^{\\mu ... }_{\\rho ... }u^{\\rho } { \\delta_{\\rm l}}u_{\\nu } - t^{\\rho ... }_{\\nu ... }u^{\\mu } { \\delta_{\\rm l}}u_{\\rho } \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath41 is a general mixed tensor .",
    "the next stage is to relate the material variations in terms of spacetime tensors .",
    "the most direct way to do this is to use the convected derivative , which relates lagrangian and material variations .",
    "applying ( [ eqn : convectderiv ] ) to ( [ eqn : materialpressure ] ) and ( [ eqn : materialelasticity ] ) one obtains  @xcite @xmath42 @xmath43 where extra terms are induced in ( [ eqn : spacetimepressure ] ) due to ( [ eqn : convectderiv ] ) .",
    "we can now begin to discuss the dynamics of an elastic medium .",
    "a _ perfect elastic medium _ is defined by the condition that the energy - momentum tensor @xmath44 is a material function of the metric tensor with respect to the flow field  @xcite , meaning that it takes the form @xmath45    the variation in the energy - momentum tensor can be obtained by using ( [ eqn : perfectem ] ) in conjunction with ( [ eqn : spacetimedensity ] ) and ( [ eqn : spacetimepressure ] ) to give @xmath46 where the non - orthogonal elasticity tensor @xmath47 can be decomposed as  @xcite @xmath48 and has the same symmetry properties as the ordinary elasticity tensor .",
    "this allows the variations to be conveniently written in terms of functional derivatives of the lagrangian with respect to the metric via @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the determinant of the metric .",
    "it is often more convenient to describe perturbations being fixed with respect to some background space .",
    "if the vector field @xmath52 is the infinitesimal displacement of the wordlines with respect to the fixed background space , then the difference between lagrangian @xmath39 and fixed ( eulerian ) variations @xmath53 is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the lie derivative .",
    "such a displacement could be removed by using a mapping of the perturbed space onto the background space , but it will be more convenient to set the gauge by some other means . in the following section , for example , we use the synchronous gauge to derive the cosmological equations of motion . for the particular case of the metric tensor then the relationship ( [ eqn : lageul ] )",
    "gives @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the eulerian variation of the metric tensor .",
    "the equation of motion for the vector field @xmath52 gives the complete system of equations for the perturbations .",

    "this tensor obeys the symmetry and orthogonality conditions @xmath62 eqn .",
    "( [ eqn : eom ] ) takes the form of a wave equation for the displacement vector @xmath52 .",
    "since all components are orthogonal the the flow then the additional degree of freedom in @xmath52 can be removed by imposing the orthogonality requirement @xmath63 .",
    "the remaining quantities required to evaluate ( [ eqn : eom ] ) are the lagrangian variation of the connection coefficients , given by @xmath64 and the flow gradient tensor given by @xmath65      the perturbed space - time metric takes the form @xmath66 , \\hspace{0.5 cm } h^{\\mu \\nu } = \\eta^{\\alpha \\mu } \\eta^{\\beta \\nu } h_{\\alpha \\beta}\\,,\\ ] ] and so the eulerian component of the metric perturbation is given by @xmath67 .",
    "we make use of the synchronous gauge conditions ( @xmath68 ) to remove the remaining degree of gauge freedom in the einstein field equations . at zeroth order",
    "the flow vector @xmath69 , and so the non - zero components of the displacement vector @xmath52 are confined to the spatial part by the orthogonality requirement @xmath63 .    in the synchronous gauge the non - zero components of the lagrangian variation of the connection are given by @xmath70 where dots are now understood to denote derivatives with respect to the conformal time and @xmath71 is the conformal time hubble parameter .",
    "we can now obtain the equations of motion and perturbed energy - momentum sources for the cosmological fluids by inserting the appropriate pressure and elasticity tensor expressions for each component into ( [ eqn : emperturb ] ) and ( [ eqn : eom ] ) .      in an isotropic perfect fluid the pressure tensor is isotropic and is given in terms of the pressure scalar @xmath1 by @xmath72 while the elasticity tensor is given in terms of the bulk modulus @xmath73 by  @xcite @xmath74 and the bulk modulus is defined by @xmath75 substituting these expressions into ( [ eqn : emperturb ] ) , we obtain the components of the perturbed energy - momentum tensor    @xmath76    where @xmath77 is the trace of the metric perturbation . from now",

    "more generally we have shown that specification of _ all _ of the components of the pressure tensor , @xmath93 , and elasticity tensor @xmath94 is sufficient to describe the perturbed energy momentum tensor using ( [ eqn : emperturb ] ) . in this section",
    "we will discuss aspects of a generalization which allows for the perturbations to be anisotropic and consider the case of cubic symmetry which is the simplest anisotropic possibility .    in general",
    ", the elasticity tensor has a total of 21 independent components  @xcite .",
    "one of these , the bulk modulus , is specified by the pressure and the other 20 are shear moduli , which can provide an anisotropic response to perturbations depending on the particular symmetry of the system .",
    "fortunately the classification of these shear moduli has been studied in the context of classical elasticity theory and it is known that there 14 different types , known as the bravais lattices . in table  [ tab : noshearmod ] we list the number of non - zero shear moduli for each symmetry group .",
    ".[tab : noshearmod ] number of non - zero shear moduli for each of the bravais lattice symmetry groups  @xcite . for the tetragonal and rhombohedral symmetries",
    "the number of shear moduli depend on the particular class of symmetry , which can be identified using the schnflies notation .",
    "there are 7 shear moduli for tetragonal symmetry with a 4-fold rotation axis ( @xmath190 ) , for example , but this reduces to 6 with the additional of a mirror plane parallel to the axis of rotation ( @xmath191 ) . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in addition to not being totally isotropic at formation ( or even having _ exact _ point symmetry ) a lattice may have initial macroscopic fluctuations relative to the equilibrium position which correspond to the isocurvature modes discussed in the previous section . since the formation of the lattice is a causal process then these modes with have an initial white noise spectrum ( @xmath192 ) .",
    "two interesting issues are the scale of symmetry breaking of the phase transition and the likely cell size of the lattice at the present day . both of these rely on us understanding the lattice formation process",
    "which is not well - understood .",
    "a simple assumption would be that the lattice forms instantaneously after the phase transition with some initial cell size @xmath193 which is some fixed fraction of the horizon size at the time of formation @xmath194 .",
    "if @xmath195 is the symmetry breaking scale which relates to the temperature of formation @xmath196 , then assuming the lattice forms in the radiation era the correlation size at formation is given by @xmath197 where @xmath198 is the number of relativistic species at formation . in the case of domain walls , if the wall density at formation is @xmath199 , and assuming the network is subsequently swept along by the hubble flow , we can estimate @xmath195 to be @xmath200 since the coefficients representing uncertainty in the wall formation process have small exponents , it seems reasonable to estimate @xmath201kev if @xmath202 .",
    "one can also compute the present day cell size in a similar fashion , which turns out to be @xmath203 since the smallest wavenumber at which non - linear effects become important in cmb codes such as camb is @xmath204 , it seems reasonable to assume that the linear response to perturbations in such a defect network can be treated in the continuum elastic medium framework .",
    "the computation of the cell size is more sensitive to the uncertainty parameters , but since causality gives the upper limit of @xmath205 the continuum medium description seems justified .",
    "one can also perform a similar exercise in the case of cosmic strings .",
    "if the wall density at formation is @xmath206 then one finds @xmath207tev and @xmath208au , with similar uncertainties in these parameters as in the domain wall case .    the allowed symmetry breaking scale",
    "may be increased further if the defect network forms during inflation . in this scenario",
    "the network is inflated outside the horizon and re - enters during a later epoch thus diluting the initial density . if one assumes that @xmath209 where @xmath210 is the reheat temperature of inflaton and @xmath211 the number of e - folds remaining when the network leaves the horizon during inflation then the symmetry breaking scale of a domain wall network is given by @xmath212 and the present day cell size is modified to @xmath213 if @xmath214 and @xmath215tev then @xmath216mev and @xmath217mpc .",
    "one should note that quantum fluctuations in the defect forming field , @xmath218 , should satisfy satisfy @xmath219 , otherwise no phase transition can occur during inflation . if @xmath220 this restricts the mass scale of inflation to @xmath221gev .",
    "if a lattice of domain walls or cosmic strings exists , their local gravitational interactions can give rise to further observable effects .",
    "the symmetry breaking scale @xmath195 is limited observationally by the local generation of density induced perturbations . in the case of domain walls ,",
    "the mass per unit area is @xmath222 and so @xmath223kev gives @xmath224 , and for @xmath225mev the wall has @xmath226 . if there are only several walls in our current horizon they induce a density fluctuation @xmath227 , with a similar sized fluctuations in temperature of the cmb .",
    "a wall with @xmath223kev would induce direct temperature fluctuations of @xmath228 , which is well below the observed value of @xmath229 . using this constraint directly ,",
    "one find that domain walls with @xmath230mev would be ruled out  @xcite .",
    "however , this assumption assumes that the walls move relativistically , with only several walls in our horizon . in the lattice structures we have envisaged here",
    "the walls are static and only move with hubble flow , and the cmb distortion in this case can be much smaller  @xcite . in the case of strings ,",
    "the mass per unit length is given by @xmath231 and so @xmath232tev gives @xmath233 .",
    "the cmb temperature distortion is of the order @xmath234 , and so low energy strings discussed here would not produce significant fluctuations in temperature .",
    "we have studied the cosmological implications of a perfect elastic fluid in the framework of general relativity . in previous work on this subject ,",
    "bucher and spergel derived the equations of motion by variation of the action assuming that the fluid is isotropic  @xcite . here , we take a more general approach using the material representation concept and obtain equations of motion in terms of the pressure and elasticity tensors of the fluid .",
    "this allows us to parameterize the most general description of linearized perturbations of the fluid in a compact and transparent manner .    under the assumption that the pressure and elasticity tensors are isotropic",
    "we derive the einstein and energy - momentum conservation equations using this approach . when the fluid has non - zero rigidity there is a source of anisotropic stress which stabilizes perturbations when @xmath235 , making these models candidates to describe the dark energy .",
    "the anisotropic stress also interacts with the vector and tensor sectors as the shear modulus induces transverse waves in the fluid .",
    "this phenomenon is well known in the laboratory . in a non - relativistic ( low pressure ) deformed medium with non - zero rigidity the temperature has both temporal and spatial variations . if the transfer of heat occurs slowly then the oscillatory motions in the deformed body are adiabatic .",
    "these motions correspond to longitudinal ( scalar ) and transverse ( vector ) elastic waves , which are related by @xmath236  @xcite . in the relativistic ( high pressure ) treatment we enforce adiabicity by assuming that there are no temporal or spatial variations in @xmath123 and the relationship between the wave propagation modes is then given by @xmath237 .",
    "we find that the elastic fluid model is similar to generalized dark energy models  @xcite .",
    "the construction of the fluid energy - momentum tensor in these models was phenomenological , and it was argued that anisotropic stress can be attributed to viscosity in the fluid .",
    "we find that the functional form of anisotropic stress suggested in  @xcite is identical to our own if the decay timescale associated with the stress term is infinite . in this case",
    ", the viscous sound speed can be directly related to the vector sound speed of a fluid with rigidity by @xmath238    there appears to be two mechanisms for stabilizing dark energy perturbations if we wish to model the dark energy as a fluid . either the fluid can be adiabatic and have rigidity , or it can be non - adiabatic and have entropy perturbations .",
    "a microphysical realization of the latter possibility is scalar field dark energy .",
    "as the evolution of perturbations is different in each model , we have investigated the potential observational differences in the cmb and matter power spectrum assuming the initial conditions were generated from curvature fluctuations in the metric .",
    "we find that the possibilities for distinguishing the two models are low using only cmb tt data .",
    "however , the te power at large scales is reduced in the elastic fluid models relative to the @xmath239cdm and scalar field models with @xmath240 .",
    "this increases the parameter space in which the two models can be differentiated , up to @xmath241 .",
    "as @xmath123 becomes closer to -1 the dark energy perturbations become less important , and the two models essentially become the same from an observational point of view .",
    "the matter power spectrum outlines an interesting difference between the two models .",
    "an important aspect of the dark energy is that it has a large jeans length so that it does not cluster on small scales . in principle",
    "though , it can cluster on large scales and we have attempted to model this by including dark energy perturbations in @xmath242 . as @xmath243",
    "we find that the elastic dark energy contribution to @xmath242 dominates and @xmath244 would be required to be compatible with large scale structure data . in the case of scalar field dark energy the contribution to @xmath242 from dark energy increases as @xmath243 but remains sub - dominant even when @xmath245 .",
    "we have also shown that both scalar and vector isocurvature modes are allowed in an elastic fluid .",
    "these modes correspond to initial fluctuations of the fluid relative to the background , and give rise to anisotropic stress on super - horizon scales .",
    "a generic feature of these modes is that power is suppressed on small relative to large scales .",
    "the dominant mode in these models would have to be the adiabatic curvature mode in order to fit the data but there could be a sub - dominant isocurvature component .",
    "our approach has shown that we can parameterize the perturbations of the energy momentum tensor in terms of the pressure and elasticity tensors of the fluid . in this work we mainly focused on the isotropic case , but this formalism can be easily extended if the elastic fluid has point symmetry .",
    "the symmetry properties of the elasticity tensor can be classified by the bravais lattices , which are familiar in crystallography .",
    "recently , there has been evidence of large scale anomalies in the cmb , most noticeably the north - south power asymmetry  @xcite and alignment of low @xmath246 multipoles  @xcite , which appear to persist in the third year wmap data  @xcite .",
    "a possible solution is that the energy momentum tensor of the dark energy is not rotationally invariant at linearized order .",
    "we have considered the case where the elasticity tensor has cubic symmetry and find that perturbation growth is dependent on the direction as well as the magnitude of the wave vector .",
    "this is work is developed further in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we are currently investigating whether these anisotropic models are compatable with the data ."
