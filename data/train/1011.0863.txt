    "the dgp model  @xcite is a 5 dimensional braneworld theory that non - trivially modifies general relativity ( gr ) in the infrared",
    ". nevertheless , at sub - crossover ( sub - hubble length ) scales many of its properties can be captured by a 4d ( boundary ) effective theory  @xcite",
    ". this effective theory amounts to gr coupled to a scalar field @xmath0 whose equation of motion has only second derivatives and is invariant under the galilean shift @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 being constant .",
    "this scalar is related to the bending of the dgp brane in the bulk and has been termed as _ galileon _  @xcite .",
    "as ghost instability has been identified on the phenomenologically interesting self - accelerating branch of the dgp model  @xcite , which can also be easily seen in the local galileon approximation  @xcite , attempts have been made to generalize the dgp galileon description to produce a healthy modified gravity theory  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", the authors wrote down the most general single galileon lagrangian .",
    "remarkably , there are only @xmath4 possible galileon terms in @xmath5 dimensional spacetime , and ghost free self - accelerating background solutions have been shown to exist in a generalized galileon theory",
    ". however , a few phenomenologically challenging problems have also been identified in the single galileon theory , such as cherenkov - like radiation in the solar system , superluminal propagation far away from a matter sauce and very low strong coupling scales  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that these problems can be avoided by adding another galileon ( in a bi - galileon theory ) , meaning the theory space of the single galileon model is actually too small  @xcite .",
    "a local bi - galileon description is also what one might expect from co - dimension 2 braneworld models  @xcite , as there are generally two brane bending directions .",
    "one would want to generalize the galileon description to have even more degrees of freedom  @xcite . to avoid a proliferation of possible terms in the theory",
    ", we can impose internal ( global ) symmetries within the multiple galileons , so that the multiple galileons form some representation of a group  @xcite , @xmath6 .",
    "that is , the multi - galileon lagrangian is imposed to be invariant under the internal transformation _",
    "i_i^  j_j , where @xmath7 is the representation matrix of a certain group and summation over repeated group indices is implied .",
    "notice that the internal symmetry could originate from braneworld scenarios , as has been identified for the @xmath8 fundamental representation  @xcite . for other interesting field",
    "theoretical and cosmological implications of the galileon theory , see  @xcite .    in  @xcite",
    ", we wrote down all possible multi - galileon terms that are consistent with the fundamental and adjoint representations of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and looked for soliton solutions in multi - galileon theories ; we did not consider coupling the symmetric multi - galileon to gravity . in this paper , we will put the symmetric multi - galileon in the context of modified gravity . in section  [ coupgravity ] , we will venture a tentative coupling , but we want to emphasize that the main results of this paper are insensitive to this explicit coupling . in section  [ goldstonet ] , we discuss the spontaneous symmetry breaking phenomenon of the symmetric multi - galileon theory on a self - accelerating background . starting from an example ,",
    "we build up a new version of goldstone s theorem in symmetric multi - galileon theories that for every broken continuous symmetry a canonical kinetic degree of freedom is lost . in section  [ hamil ] ,",
    "we derive the hamiltonian formulation of a general multi - galileon theory ( with or without internal symmetry ) and find it is not bounded below .",
    "we speculate whether this might be overcome in more complete theories .",
    "in the original galileon model  @xcite , the galileon is coupled to graviton mainly via the kinetic mixing h_=_+2 _ , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are jordan and einstein frame ( perturbative ) metrics ; @xmath0 s contribution to the energy momentum tensor , or , its _ direct _ influence to the geometry is negligible .",
    "so in a sense the galileon modified gravity is a `` genuine '' infrared modification of general relativity , differing from models such as quintessence  @xcite , which has significant contribution to the energy momentum tensor . in this paper",
    ", we stick to this paradigm and tentatively propose the multi - galileon s coupling to gravity as @xmath12   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the multi - galileon lagrangian . for a general multi - galileon theory without internal symmetries",
    ", we might want to redefine @xmath15 to simplify the coupling , while keep the structure of @xmath16 unchanged .",
    "but this is usually not feasible in symmetric multi - galileon models . for example , in the case of @xmath8 fundamental representation , @xmath17 can not be linked to @xmath18 by an internal @xmath8 transformation .",
    "( note that the @xmath8 invariant coupling @xmath19 , @xmath20 being a general function of @xmath21 , has been considered in  @xcite , and the authors found gradient instability as well as superluminal excitations for the spherically symmetric background . ) we could argue that from the viewpoint of braneworld scenarios the coupling  ( [ coupling ] ) ( instead of , say , @xmath22 ) might be what one might expect for symmetric multi - galileon models . in a braneworld setup ,",
    "the multiple galileon fields living on a brane usually descend from the extra dimension coordinates as functions of the 4d brane volume coordinates  @xcite .",
    "since the symmetric multiple galileon fields enjoy some internal symmetry , the extra dimensional coordinates must have the corresponding symmetry at least near the brane . as the near brane geometry is expected to plays a role in determining the coupling to gravity",
    ", we may expect the different multiple galileons couple to gravity on a equal or similar basis .    at distances and time scales shorter than the hubble length",
    ", the friedmann - robertson - walker metric can be considered as a perturbation above minkowski spacetime . due to the kinetic mixing ( [ coupling ] ) , the cosmic profile of the multi - galileon can be cast _ within the hubble length _ as  @xcite [ cospi ] = -(h^2-h_gr^2)x_x^+12(-_gr)t^2 , where @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the actual hubble parameter for a given source @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the hypothetical hubble parameter in gr with the same @xmath25 as the source .",
    "thus the cosmic background configuration of @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 .",
    "assuming all the fields have similar coordinate dependence , the vacuum solution is given by |_i=-|k_i x_x^ , |k|k_1+ ... +|k_n = h^2-h_gr^2 .",
    "in this section we will see that the symmetric multi - galileon modified gravity exhibits spontaneous breaking of symmetries on some vacuum solution , and for every broken continuous symmetry the theory loses a canonical kinetic term , which resembles the usual goldstone s theorem in a scalar field theory .",
    "we will also discuss the implications of this modified goldstone s theorem .",
    "let us first see a simple example of this theorem : spontaneous breaking of the @xmath8 fundamental representation .",
    "the most general @xmath8 multi - galileon lagrangian in the fundamental representation is given by  @xcite [ sonl ] _",
    "= -_^i^_i - ^_[]_^i^_i _ ^^j _ ^_j , where @xmath29}\\equiv 3!\\delta^{\\rho}_{[\\sigma}\\delta^{\\mu}_{\\nu}\\delta^{\\lambda}_{\\tau]}$ ] , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are free parameters . varying ( [ coupling ] ) with respect to @xmath32",
    ", we get the equations of motion : [ eom1 ] 2 _ i + 4 ^_[]_^_i _ ^^j _ ^_j = - t .",
    "we would like to see whether there is any _ self - accelerating _ background ( or vacuum ) in this theory . by a self - accelerating background",
    ", we refer to the case where the universe has a ( at least approximately ) de sitter solution without support of a cosmological constant , i.e. , the case where @xmath33 with @xmath34 and @xmath35 is a solution to the equations of motion ( [ eom1 ] ) . substituting this profile into the equations of motion , we get [ sabg ] -4 |k_i ( + 3|k^j |k_j ) = 0 , which reduce to [ mss ] |k_i=0 , or [ sas ] |k^j |k_j=- .",
    "the former solution corresponds to minkowski spacetime , while the later can be a self - accelerating solution if @xmath36 and @xmath34 , which we assume to be satisfied .",
    "note that ( [ sas ] ) is not an isolated solution , instead it is a continuum of possible solutions .",
    "then we would like to see whether the self - accelerating solution can be free of ghosts , negative canonical kinetic terms .",
    "to this end , we expand the lagrangian ( [ sonl ] ) above the background ( [ sas ] ) , i.e. , we do the transformation @xmath37 and neglect the background part of the lagrangian : @xmath38}\\pd_{\\rho}\\pi_i\\pd^{\\sigma}\\!\\pi^j \\pd_{\\mu}\\pd^{\\nu}\\!\\pi_j { \\nonumber\\\\}&-\\beta\\ , \\delta^{\\phantom{[}\\rho\\mu\\lambda}_{[\\sigma\\nu\\tau]}\\pd_{\\rho}\\pi^i\\pd^{\\sigma}\\!\\pi_i \\pd_{\\mu}\\pd^{\\nu}\\!\\pi^j \\pd_{\\lambda } \\pd^{\\tau}\\!\\pi_j   .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] requiring the self - accelerating background to be ghost free gives rise to @xmath39 , so the conditions for a ghost free self - accelerating solution are > 0  0 .",
    "therefore , in the @xmath8 ( fundamental ) multi - galileon theory , when the self - accelerating branch is ghost free , the minkowski branch is inevitably haunted by ghosts , and vice versa . also , we see that there is just one canonical kinetic term on the self - accelerating background , while on the minkowski background there are @xmath40 of them .",
    "all of these would become apparent from a point of view of spontaneous symmetry breaking . to facilitate this approach , we would like to utilize the _ action polynomial _ introduced in  @xcite from that defined in our previous paper .",
    "this is because here we write @xmath41 , while in  @xcite we use @xmath42 .",
    "these two forms are related by integration by parts in the action , so they are physically equivalent .",
    "however , when @xmath0 is evaluated at @xmath43 , total derivatives also give rise to terms proportional to @xmath44 , so they differ by a factor of @xmath45 , i.e. , @xmath46 at @xmath43 . ] : @xmath47 where @xmath0 is evaluated at @xmath48 . by explicit calculation",
    "@xcite , we have shown that the extrema of @xmath49 correspond to cosmic background solutions ; also , the coefficient matrix of the canonical kinetic terms of the @xmath40-galileon about a background ( @xmath50 ) is equal to the hessian of @xmath49 about the background : [ cmkinetic ] k_ij(|k ) = h_ij(|k ) .",
    "|_k=|k , meaning among the extrema only the ( local ) minima are ghost free ones .",
    "these properties of @xmath49 allow us to treat @xmath49 as some kind of _ effective potential _ in finding ghost free vacua .",
    "as an aside , note that in canonical field theories such as a scalar field theory , the hamiltonian of the theory provides an energy function to minimize to find stable vacua .",
    "however , due to their non - trivial vacuum configurations and higher derivative nature , the hamiltonian formulation of multi - galileon theories does not give rise to such a clear energy function for the background configuration @xmath43 ; see section  [ hamil ] for details .",
    "now , we can easily recover the results of the @xmath8 multi - galileon vacuum solutions using @xmath49 .",
    "the extrema of @xmath49 give rise to the minkowski background @xmath51 and the self - accelerating background @xmath52 .",
    "the background @xmath52 is a minimum of @xmath49 only if @xmath53 and @xmath39 . also , since the continuum @xmath52 is a minimum , topologically @xmath51 can not be a minimum , thus for the same set of parameters only one of the two backgrounds can be stable .",
    "the hessian of @xmath49 about the self - accelerating background is given by @xmath54 , which has only one non - zero eigenvalue , so there is just one canonical kinetic term on this background .",
    "indeed , we might visualize @xmath49 with a ghost free self - accelerating background by a `` mexican hat '' ( fig .  [ mexhat ] ) .",
    "the trough of this mexican hat is an @xmath55-sphere , respecting @xmath8 .",
    "an @xmath55-sphere ( or @xmath8 ) has @xmath56 independent rotational symmetries .",
    "the vacuum solution occupies one point on the trough and thus only respects an @xmath57 subgroup , which leaves a sub @xmath58-sphere still rotational symmetric and breaks @xmath59 rotational symmetries . only the radial direction around the trough accommodates non - trivial `` oscillations '' , reflecting the presence of only one canonical kinetic term .",
    "the @xmath59 flat directions represent the loss of @xmath59 canonical kinetic terms .     of the @xmath8 multi - galileon ( plotted for the case of @xmath60 ) .",
    "the vacuum rests on the trough , spontaneously breaking @xmath8 to @xmath57 , therefore fluctuations along the @xmath59 flat directions of the trough do not have canonical kinetic terms.,width=220,height=220 ]      this is of course reminiscent of goldstone s theorem for a canonical scalar field theory with a potential .",
    "here we are able to prove an analogous theorem for a symmetric multi - galileon theory with an arbitrary internal group that the number of canonical kinetic terms that are lost is equal to the number of spontaneously broken symmetries , which in turn equals the dimension of the total symmetry group minus that of the unbroken subgroup .",
    "again it is sufficient to use the action polynomial @xmath49 to prove this .",
    "let @xmath61 be a ( local ) minimum of @xmath49 , so it is a sensible background to expand the theory . since @xmath61 is a minimum , @xmath62 should only have non - negative eigenvalues .",
    "the eigenvectors of positive eigenvalues correspond to the canonical kinetic terms , while the eigenvectors of zero eigenvalues correspond to the degrees of freedom without canonical kinetic terms .    to prove the theorem",
    ", we must show that every spontaneously broken symmetry gives rise to an independent zero - eigenvalued eigenvector . under an infinitesimal group action , for the configuration @xmath63 , we have [ gptf ] k^i k^i+^i(k ) , where @xmath64 is an infinitesimal .",
    "since @xmath65 is invariant under a group transformation , from ( [ actpoly ] ) , we infer that @xmath49 is also invariant .",
    "so we have l(k)=l(k+ ( k))=l(k)+ ^i(k ) , which leads to the identity ^i(k)=0 . differentiating it with respect to @xmath66 and evaluating it at the vacuum of the theory ( @xmath50 ) gives [ cmdrel ] k_ij(|k)^j(|k)=0 , where @xmath67 is the coefficient matrix of the canonical kinetic terms , as defined in ( [ cmkinetic ] )",
    "now , if the transformation ( [ gptf ] ) belongs to the unbroken subgroup , the vacuum @xmath50 is invariant under the transformation and the relation ( [ cmdrel ] ) is trivial as we have @xmath68 .",
    "if the transformation ( [ gptf ] ) belongs to a spontaneously broken symmetry , the vacuum is changed along the flat directions of the continuous minimum of @xmath49 and so we have @xmath69 . in this case",
    ", @xmath67 has a zero eigenvalue and the eigenvector @xmath70 , or @xmath71 , is the degree of freedom that loses its canonical kinetic term .      in multi - galileon theories , due to the presence of higher order kinetic terms , absence of a canonical kinetic term does not necessarily mean loss of a dynamical degree of freedom . taking the @xmath8 multi - galileon theory for example , by integration by parts the cubic term of the lagrangian above the self - accelerating background ( [ sonlsa ] ) can be cast as @xmath72}\\pd_{a } \\pi^i \\pd^{b}\\!\\pi_i\\ , \\pd_{c } \\pd^{d}(\\bar{k}^j \\pi_j )    , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 are spatial indices ( rather than group indices ) , and the theory has @xmath40 cubic kinetic terms .",
    "the conjugate momenta of @xmath74 is non - vanishing and the canonical phase space is non - trivial for all the @xmath40 degrees of freedom .",
    "so there are still @xmath40 apparent dynamical degrees of freedom on the self - accelerating background .",
    "however , since a mode without a canonical kinetic term can be regarded as infinitely strongly coupled and vainshtein mechanism takes effect in galileon models , these modes would self - screen themselves from the others .",
    "we shall demonstrate this schematically .",
    "suppose @xmath75 loses its canonical kinetic term around the self - accelerating vacuum and consider a slightly different background where the lagrangian is given by ~^2 m_p^2 _ 1 _ 1 + _ 1 _ 1 _ 1 + _ 1 t+ ... , with @xmath76 standing for other interactions and modes . to see the genuine dynamics of this mode",
    ", we canonically normalizing it , which gives rise to ~m_p^2 _ 1 _ 1 + _ 1 _ 1 _ 1 + 1_1 t + ... .",
    "we can recover the perturbative lagrangian around the vacuum by taking the limit @xmath77 , where we can clearly see that @xmath75 is infinitely strongly coupled .",
    "now , we can calculate that the vainshtein radius of a spherical source ( @xmath78 ) for @xmath75 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) : r_v=(1)^43()^ .",
    "it goes to infinity when @xmath64 goes to 0 , meaning this mode would be self - screened at infinitely large distances , and thus is effectively non - dynamical on the vacuum , at least in terms of weak gravitational interactions .",
    "nevertheless , as mentioned above , although some modes in the galileon multiplet lose their canonical kinetic terms on a self - accelerating vacuum , these modes can re - acquire their quadratic kinetic terms on backgrounds with matter sources . therefore , around a generic background such as in the solar system , these modes are indeed not strongly coupled . as an aside ,",
    "if there is a cosmological constant , the multi - galileon internal symmetry will be explicitly broken , in which case there is generally no loss of canonical kinetic terms .",
    "for the example of @xmath60 fundamental representation , the action polynomial is deformed to be a tilted mexican hat where there is only an unique minimum .",
    "when calculating the leading corrections to gr , thanks to vainshtein effect , we might simply exclude these inert modes .",
    "so the spontaneous symmetry breaking and the subsequent freeze - out of some dynamical modes could be reflected in tests of modification to gravity force , as the leading corrections are encoded in the canonical kinetic terms .",
    "we still take the @xmath8 multi - galileon for example .",
    "first , note that the one particle exchange amplitude between two conserved sources @xmath25 and @xmath79 in gr schematically is given by _",
    "gr~-2m_p^2(t^t_-12 tt ) . for simplicity , we assuming @xmath80 , so we have @xmath81 .",
    "when the vacuum is spontaneously broken and rests on the self - accelerating branch ( [ sas ] ) , from ( [ sonlsa ] ) we can see that the @xmath8 multi - galileon gives rise to a leading correction [ modsa ] _",
    "sa=-_gr~ tt. this is compared to the case without spontaneous symmetry breaking , when the leading correction on the minkowski branch ( [ mss ] ) is given by _",
    "m~- tt .    on the other hand , when testing the multi - galileon modification to gravitational force upto leading order , we have to deal with observational degeneracy between multi - galileon theories with different internal symmetries and different choices of vacuum branches . again taking the @xmath8 example and assuming @xmath80 , the leading correction from the @xmath8 multi - galileon on the self - accelerating branch ( [ modsa ] ) is the same as that from a multi - galileon theory without internal symmetries and with canonical kinetic terms @xmath82 , provided @xmath40 is an even number .",
    "in this section , we deviate from our main plot of the paper and briefly introduce a subplot : the hamiltonian approach of multi - galileon theories .",
    "first , we derive the hamiltonian for a general multi - galileon theory with or without internal symmetries .",
    "as the lagrangian of a multi - galileon theory contains terms with more than 2 spacetime derivatives , one might expect the hamiltonian formulation of a multi - galileon theory should involve ostrogradski s prescription for high order derivative theories ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "however , a bell should be certainly rung to this naive thinking once we notice the fact that the equations of motion of a multi - galileon theory has only second order derivatives .",
    "we will see that a general multi - galileon lagrangian can be cast to have only up to first order time derivatives . a general multi - galileon theory without a tadpole term can be written as  @xcite @xmath83}}_{[\\nu _ { 2} ... \\nu _ { n } ] } \\pd_{\\mu_{2}}\\pi_{i _ { 1}}\\pd^{\\nu _ { 2 } } \\pi_{i _ { 2 } } \\pd_{\\mu _ { 3}}\\pd^{\\nu _ { 3 } } \\pi_{i _ { 3}} ... \\pd_{\\mu _ { n}}\\pd^{\\nu _ { n } } \\pi_{i _ { n}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath84}\\equiv ( n-1)!\\delta^{\\:\\mu_2}_{[\\nu_2 } ...",

    "to see what the derivative structure is , we should unfold the anti - symmetrisation . since the hamiltonian formulation only requires the knowledge of the time derivative structure , we only need to separate the time derivatives from the spatial ones .",

    "the perturbative hamiltonian above some self - accelerating background ( @xmath50 ) can also be cast in the form ( [ hamilt ] ) with the parameters @xmath116 replaced by a new set of parameters @xmath117 ( as polynomials of @xmath118 ) ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , so it is also unbounded below . in a fundamental theory , this of course signals instabilities .",
    "however , the multi - galileon modified gravity is only supposed to be the decoupling limit of some underlying full theory , so one should really check whether the hamiltonian of the underlying full theory is well behaved or not .",
    "the underlying theory presumably has 4d diffeomorphism invariance , so the corresponding naive 4d hamiltonian ( excluding the part from extra dimensions ) is tuned to zero by 4 constraint equations , similar to that in gr .",
    "a useful 4d hamiltonian arises when the theory is `` deparameterized ''  @xcite , but from the experiences in gr , even checking the positivity of the background solution could be nontrivial ) is included in the constraint equations , the multi - galileon hamiltonian ( [ hamilt ] ) being unbounded below is irrelevant to the stability issue of the full theory . ] .    on the other hand , due to the derivative structure of the multi - galileon theories ,",
    "the most negative hamiltonian value is achieved by setting the gradients close to the cutoff of the theory , i.e. , @xmath119 .",
    "this kind of being unbounded below pushes the limit of a classical theory , as it relies on a small region of the canonical phase space , so one might also doubt whether quantum corrections can alther the picture . a famous example of this is the hydrogen atom : the classical coulomb potential for this system ( @xmath120 ) can be made arbitrarily negative by placing the electron close to the nucleus , but the hydrogen atom is stable upon quantisation of electrodynamics .",
    "we have coupled the multi - galileon theory with internal symmetries studied in  @xcite to conventional general relativity ( gr ) and proposed it as a modified gravity theory in the decoupling limit where the multi - galileon modifies gr only by mixing with the transverse graviton .",
    "we have discussed the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking of these theories on ( classical ) self - accelerating vacua .",
    "we point out that , similar to that in canonical scalar field theories , the pattern of the symmetry breaking is governed by a new version of goldstone s theorem that for every broken continuous symmetry the theory loses a canonical kinetic term .",
    "note that as the energy - nomentum tensor @xmath121 by definition vanishes in the self - accelerating vacuum , this theorem is largely insensitive to the coupling to gr .",
    "but we do assume the background configuration of the multi - galileon is given by @xmath122 .",
    "we have also discussed implications of this theorem . in particular , we suggest that the mode that loses its canonical kinetic term , although apparently non - trivial in the phase space , becomes inert due to vainshtein mechanism .",
    "this would lead to different modification to gravitational force , compared to what one would naively expect from the lagragian with the broken vacuum hidden .",
    "also , there would be degeneracy among multi - galileon theories with different internal symmetries and different choices of vacuum branches .",
    "we have also derived the hamiltonian of a general multi - galileon theory .",
    "we find the hamiltonian with the configuration @xmath123 does not give rise to a good `` effective potential '' to minimize to find the background solution .",
    "besides , we find the hamiltonian is not bounded below because of the higher order multi - galileon terms .",
    "we speculate this pathology might arise from the decoupling limit or the classical nature of multi - galileon theories and argue that the underlying full theory for the multi - galileon or even its quantum version should be investigated to decide whether this is a real problem or not .",
    "there are a few attempts to put the galileon description in a more formal framework  @xcite , and it is interesting to see whether the vacuum hamiltonian in these models is bounded below , which we leave for future work .     + *",
