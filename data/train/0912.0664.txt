    "one of the most relevant issues in cosmology is understanding the evolution of galaxy populations .",
    "thanks to recently developed techniques and improved instrumentation , observations of high redshift galaxies ( @xmath5 ) began to be possible during the last years @xcite .",
    "the fundamental quantity used in the exploration of these galaxy populations is the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) . in particular",
    ", the lf in the rest - frame uv provides valuable information on key physical processes .",
    "the uv output of a galaxy imposes constraints on the instantaneous formation rate and amount of young stars in a galaxy .",
    "this kind of census provides information on the role of galactic star populations in the reionization of the universe @xcite .",
    "observationally , the method of choice to gather a large sample of galaxies at high redshift is the drop - out technique .",
    "this technique detects the spectral discontinuity at @xmath6    ( lyman break ) due to the absorption of uv radiation by intergalactic hydrogen gas using multi - wavelength broad band imaging @xcite .",
    "the galaxies discovered using this method receive the name of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) .",
    "motivated by the observational results , recent theoretical studies of lbgs beyond @xmath5 have been developed @xcite .",
    "these theoretical studies , usually require computational techniques to produce a mock galaxy population which can be directly compared with the observed one . in the case of the rest - frame uv lf ,",
    "two important elements are required in the model : the stellar population ( masses , ages and metallicities ) and the corresponding gas content in order to derive the extinction properties .",
    "modelling the intrinsic uv emission through stellar population synthesis models is now a standard procedure @xcite . on the other hand , having a proper estimation of the extinction is a more uncertain process .",
    "the estimation of the extinction can assume the form of a simple calzetti law @xcite , where usually the uv magnitudes of each galaxy are reduced by the same amount regardless of the physical properties of the gas in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "if the galaxy model provides information on the gas and its metallicity contents , it would be desirable to implement a more physical model for the dust obscuration and try to put some constraints on the amount and distribution ( i.e. clumpiness ) of the dust on galactic scales @xcite .",
    "in this letter we present the first results from the _ marenostrum high - z universe_. the simulation follows self - consistently the dynamical evolution of more than 2 billion dark matter and gas particles and includes a prescription for star formation , supernovae feedback and uv background . here , we will present the numerical estimates for the continuum rest - frame uv emission from the stellar component , and a dust attenuation model . our main objective is to compare the numerical predictions with the observed evolution of the uv lf between redshifts @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the _ marenostrum high - z universe _ simulation follows the non linear evolution of structures in baryons ( gas and stars ) and dark matter , starting from @xmath9 within a cube of @xmath10 comoving on a side .",
    "the cosmological parameters used correspond to wmap1 data @xcite and are @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , a hubble parameter @xmath15 , and a spectral index @xmath16 .",
    "the initial density field has been sampled by @xmath17 dark matter particles with a mass of @xmath18 and @xmath17 sph gas particles with a mass of @xmath19 .",
    "the simulation has been performed using the treepm+sph code ` gadget-2 ` @xcite .",
    "radiative and compton cooling processes for an optically thin primordial plasma of helium and hydrogen are included .",
    "we assumed photo - ionisation by an external spatially uniform uv - background adopting @xcite .",
    "the physics of star formation is treated by means of a sub - resolution model in which the gas of the interstellar medium ( ism ) is described as a multiphase medium of hot and cold gas @xcite .",
    "stars can be formed in regions that are sufficiently dense and cold .",
    "we consider the thermal feedback of supernovae as well as the effects of stellar winds following the model described in @xcite the gravitational smoothing scale was set to 2 in comoving coordinates .",
    "the simulation was run in the marenostrum supercomputer using 800 processors simultaneously .",
    "this simulation is intended to study the early phases of galaxy formation .",
    "it is currently at z=4.55 , after spending more than 4.5 million cpu hours .",
    "we identify the objects in the simulations using the ` amiga ` halo finder ( ` ahf ` ) which identifies both halos and subhalos . ` ahf ` is an improvement of the ` mhf ` halo finder @xcite , which locates local overdensities in an adaptively smoothed density field as prospective halo centers . `",
    "ahf ` is described in detail in @xcite .    in ` ahf ` the local potential minima are computed for each of these density peaks and the gravitationally bound particles are determined . only peaks with at least 20 bound particles",
    "are considered as haloes and retained for further analysis in ` ahf ` .",
    "the thermal energy of gas particles is taken into account during the calculation of the binding energy .",
    "all objects with more than @xmath20 particles , dark matter , gas and stars combined , are used in our present analyses .",
    "we assume a galaxy is resolved if the object contains @xmath21 or more star particles , which corresponds to objects with @xmath22 particles of gas .",
    "this ensures a proper estimation of the average gas column densities in our numerical galaxies .",
    "we then build the full spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and compute the dust attenuation using the information from the stars and gas particles of each galaxy . in the following section we explain the details of these procedures .",
    "the photometric properties of the galaxies are calculated employing the stellar population synthesis model ` stardust ` , using the methods described in @xcite .",
    "we adopt a salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) .",
    "the seds are built using the ` ahf ` catalogs .",
    "nevertheless , we have checked that all the results quoted in this letter remain valid if we identify galaxies by the friend - of - friends algorithm that run over the star particles only .",
    "the dust attenuation model parametrizes both the extinction in a homogeneous interstellar medium ( ism ) and the molecular clouds around young stars , following the physical model of @xcite .",
    "the attenuation from dust in the homogeneous ism assumes later a slab geometry , while the additional attenuation for young stars assumes a spherical symmetry .",
    "we describe first the optical depth for the homogeneous interstellar medium , denoted by @xmath23 .",
    "we take the mean perpendicular optical depth of a galactic disc at wavelength @xmath24 to be    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the extinction curve from , @xmath27 is the gas metallicity , @xmath28 is the mean atomic hydrogen column density and @xmath29 is a factor that takes into account the evolution of the dust to gas ratio at different redshifts , with @xmath30 from the available constraints based on simplified theoretical models @xcite and observations around @xmath31 @xcite . given the uncertainties in this value , we will treat @xmath32 as a free parameter .",
    "the mean h column density is calculated as    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is the universal mass fraction of hydrogen , @xmath35 is the mass in gas , @xmath36 is the radius of the galaxy and @xmath37 is the proton mass .",
    "the extinction curve depends on the gas metallicity @xmath27 and is based on an interpolation between the solar neighborhood and the large and small magellanic clouds ( @xmath38 for @xmath39  and @xmath40 for @xmath41 ) .    the radius , stellar and gas masses for each galaxy are taken from the ` ahf ` catalogs .",
    "computing @xmath28 from the galaxy catalogs turns out to give similar results , on average , than integrating the 3d gas distribution of the galaxies using the appropriate sph kernel .",
    "the difference between the average hydrogen column densities calculated in these two different ways are less than @xmath42 regardless of the size of the galaxy , provided that the gas distribution is sampled with more than @xmath21 particles .",
    "in addition to the foreground , homogeneous ism extinction , we also model , in a simple manner , the attenuation of young stars that are embedded in their nest clouds .",
    "stars younger than a given age , @xmath43 , are subject to an additional attenuation with mean perpendicular optical depth    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the fraction of the total optical depth seen by the young stars that is found in the homogeneous ism .",
    "@xcite in a study of 115 nearby galaxies , spanning a wide range of star formation activities , find that @xmath45 is typically @xmath46 with a wide range of scatter between @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "given the possible uncertainties in extrapolating the typical values of @xmath45 to high redshift , we will treat this quantity as a free parameter .",
    "in the calculation of the luminosity functions we have made first an additional correction motivated from the different abundance of dark matter halos between the cosmology used in the simulation ( wmap1 , @xmath49 @xcite ) and the values of the cosmological parameters estimated from the latest cmb results ( wmap5 , @xmath50 @xcite ) . at a given redshift and mass range ,",
    "the wmap1 universe has a larger halo number density than in the wmap5 one .",
    "we estimate the influence of a different cosmology using the sheth - tormen formalism @xcite .",
    "the ratio between the wmap5 and wmap1 halo mass functions is used as a weight factor for each galaxy ( depending on the mass of the host halo ) in the construction of the lf .",
    "this procedure is justified because of the strong correlation shown between the uv luminosity and the halo mass .",
    "we have tested this correction by running two additional simulations with exactly the same mass and force resolutions but a corresponding smaller volume to speed up the calculations ( i.e @xmath51 particles in a @xmath52 comoving boxsize ) .",
    "they were performed with same initial conditions using the wmap1 and wmap5 cosmological parameters . though not shown here",
    ", we do reproduce the results of the wmap5 run when using the wmap1 run with the aforementioned correction .",
    "the results after correcting for the halo abundance are shown in figure [ fig : norm ] .",
    "the black squares represent the results without any dust extinction .",
    "all the rest - frame uv lfs , without dust extinction , strongly over - predict ( up to 2 orders of magnitude ) the observational estimates in all the redshift range , in fairly agreement with results from other @xmath4cdm simulations @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy can not be attributed to the selection of the salpeter imf to compute the seds .",
    "other imfs , such as chabrier @xcite or kroupa @xcite have lower mass to luminosity ratios in the uv ( at most @xmath53 ) with respect to a salpeter imf , for a young starburst of a given age . @xcite .",
    "these imfs would then increase the discrepancy between our simulation and observations .",
    "one could argue that the excess of galaxies in our simulation could be related with some of the astrophysical processes that shape the luminosity function at low redshift @xcite .",
    "in particular , an improved modelling of supernovae and quasar feedbacks can modify the luminosity function .",
    "this scenario can not be ruled out on the basis of the present simulation , and certainly deserves further study . nevertheless ,",
    "in our case , we want to show that a simple , physically motivated extinction model can explain the different behaviour of the simulated and observed uv lf .",
    "if we apply only the extinction due to the homogeneous ism , parametrized by @xmath54 ( for any value of @xmath32 ) then only the most massive galaxies are effectively extinguished .",
    "if we modify the values of @xmath32 in such a way as to match the bright end of the observed lf , we still find an excess of simulated galaxies at the faint end .",
    "to modify the luminosities at the faint end , specially at @xmath7 and @xmath55 , one needs to apply a larger extinction on the young stars .",
    "the correction on the population of young stars turns out to be independent on the total mass of the galaxy , modifying both the bright and faint ends of the lfs .",
    "we explore the parameter space in order to find the best set of parameters ( @xmath32 , @xmath45 , @xmath56 ) in our extinction model which provides a good fit to the observational data . in figure",
    "[ fig : norm ] the red hexagons show the results for the best fit parameters : @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59myr .",
    "it means that stars younger than @xmath59myr are almost completely extinguished .",
    "thus , the optical depth in the clouds embedding the young stars must be between @xmath2 ( @xmath60 ) and @xmath3 ( @xmath61 ) times larger than the optical depth in the ism .",
    "for comparison , the largest values found in local galaxies by @xcite are @xmath62 times the optical depth in the ism .",
    "furthermore , we do not find any strong degeneracy between the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath45 .",
    "we consider now the colors of the galaxies .",
    "one of the simplest ways to observationally estimate the dust attenuation is through the uv slope @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : beta ] we show the values for @xmath63 in the simulated galaxies and compared to recent observational estimations @xcite .",
    "we find that that the extinguished colors are consistent with the constraints worked out from the observations .",
    "there is a minor discrepancy at the faintest magnitudes ( m@xmath65 -19 ) which is not highly significant if we consider that the error bars in the figure [ fig : beta ] represent a @xmath66-@xmath67 scatter .",
    "remarkably , some extinguished simulated galaxies at @xmath68 ( not shown in the figure ) still show very blue slopes @xmath69 as seen in the observations .",
    "we have used the _ marenostrum high - z universe _ , currently the largest sph simulation of galaxy formation , with more than 2 billion particles , to study the evolution of the rest - frame uv luminosity function between @xmath70 .",
    "we find that the uv lf from the simulation over - predicts systematically the observations .",
    "using a chabrier , kroupa or top heavy imf , instead of the salpeter imf we have used here , will increase the disagreement .",
    "we further correct the luminosity of each galaxy by dust attenuation .",
    "if we correct only by the attenuation produced by an homogeneous ism , with an optical depth calculated using equation [ eq : ism ] , we find that the results are unsatisfactory . in that kind of extinction model ,",
    "the dust optical depth turns out to be dependent on the mass of the galaxy , making the bright end of the lf more extinguished than the faint end , the latter remaining basically unchanged .",
    "we use then a simple but physically motivated model based on @xcite , where the extinction is described by a homogeneous ism component plus a clumpy component affecting the younger stars .",
    "we find that the additional extinction on the younger stars is necessary to reproduce the overall normalization and shape of the luminosity functions between @xmath71 .",
    "the final modification on the uv luminosities is independent on the total mass of the galaxy , meaning that the faint end of the lf can be modified as well .",
    "we find that all the stars younger than @xmath1 myr must be obscured almost completely in order to get a good agreement to the observed evolution of the lfs .",
    "this means that the optical depth in the clouds embedding the young stars must be between @xmath2 and @xmath3 times larger than the optical depth from the homogeneous ism .",
    "compared to observations of local galaxies this proportion between the two optical depths is one order of magnitude larger than the highest estimates . the agreement of our model to available observational constraints hints for a clumpy ism at high redshift .",
    "the extinction model we propose is consistent with the observational constraints of the uv slope between @xmath71 .",
    "we even find some galaxies with very blue uv slopes as seen in galaxies at @xmath72 @xcite .",
    "the agreement is less satisfactory at lower uv magnitudes @xmath73 .",
    "the extinction model we apply to the very young stars is thus not visible as a strong change in the uv slopes , but could be observationally detected in the rest - frame infrared with instruments like herschel and alma .",
    "a complementary view of the results presented so far will be provided in an upcoming publication on the physical nature of lyman-@xmath32 emitters in the _ marenostrum high - z universe_.",
