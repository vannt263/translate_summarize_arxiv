    "measurements of the total cross section of @xmath4 annihilation into hadrons at low energies as well as of the cross sections of exclusive hadronic channels are of great interest for better understanding the interactions of light quarks .",
    "this precise knowledge is also necessary for calculations of effects such as contributions of hadronic vacuum polarization to @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite , tests of the standard model via the hypothesis of conserved vector current ( cvc ) relating @xmath7 hadrons to hadronic @xmath8-lepton decays @xcite .",
    "annihilation of @xmath9 into five pions was first observed by m3n @xcite , dm1 @xcite and cmd @xcite detectors .",
    "these limited data samples allowed one to study this process qualitatively and estimate the magnitude of the corresponding cross section .",
    "later measurements by various groups in orsay and novosibirsk ( see @xcite ) provided more detailed information on the energy dependence of the cross section for the processes @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "both isoscalar and isovector intermediate states can contribute to the cross section of the reaction @xmath12 . in the isoscalar case",
    "the final @xmath13 state is produced via @xmath14 and its excitations ( @xmath15 ) , whereas the isovector contribution includes the @xmath16 final state arising from the @xmath17 and its excitations ( @xmath18 ) . since violation of isospin symmetry in electromagnetic interactions is small",
    ", one can expect that the interference between the modes with different isospin is also small , so that the two cross sections could be found independently .",
    "the experiment was performed with the cmd-2 detector at the @xmath9 collider vepp-2 m in novosibirsk @xcite . the c.m .",
    "energy range from the threshold of hadron production to 1.4 gev was scanned with 10 mev steps .",
    "the highest energy attainable at vepp-2 m is rather close to the threshold of both final states studied , and therefore for the analysis of five pion production about 3 pb@xmath1 of data collected in the energy range 1280 to 1380 mev were used .",
    "the tracking system of the detector consists of a drift chamber with about 250 @xmath19 resolution transverse to the beam and a proportional z - chamber used for the trigger , both inside a superconducting solenoid with a field of 1 t. photons are detected in the barrel csi calorimeter with 8 - 10% energy resolution and the endcap bgo calorimeter with 6% energy resolution .",
    "more details on the detector can be found elsewhere @xcite .    to select events of the processes under study",
    "the following cuts were applied :    1 .",
    "four charged tracks and two or more photons are found .",
    "the sum of the charges of all tracks is equal to zero .",
    "3 .   for each track",
    "the z coordinate of the origin is close to the interaction point ",
    "@xmath20 cm .",
    "the impact parameter of each track is small enough  @xmath21 cm .",
    "the background remaining after applying these cuts is mostly caused by the process @xmath22 where extra photons appear because of the splitting of clusters from charged particles .",
    "the events selected by the above process were kinematically reconstructed with the following constraints : @xmath23 @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 are energies and momenta of charged particles , while @xmath27 and @xmath28 are those for photons .",
    "the kinematic fit tries all possible photon pairs in the event and the one with the smallest @xmath29 value is used in further analysis .",
    "the events with thus chosen pairs of photons were again processed by kinematic reconstruction with an additional constraint requiring the invariant mass of the two photons be equal to the @xmath30 mass : @xmath31 the second stage helps to increase the three pion invariant mass @xmath32 resolution .    to further suppress the background from @xmath33 events two additional cuts were used :    1 .",
    "the energy of each of the two selected photons is large enough  @xmath34 mev .",
    "this cut efficiently rejects events with fake photons emerging because of the cluster splitting .",
    "the @xmath29 parameter characterizing the quality of the kinematic fit is @xmath35 .    the @xmath32 distribution of selected events is presented in fig .  [ tot_sp ] .",
    "the invariant mass @xmath32 for selected events .",
    "the solid curve represents the result of the fit , the dotted curve is the contribution of the @xmath36 mode , the dashed - dotted curve is that of @xmath37 , and the dashed curve shows the contribution of the background process @xmath38.,scaledwidth=59.0% ]    since all four possible combinations of pions contribute , a large combinatorial background is observed .",
    "the left peak in the figure corresponds to the @xmath37 production whereas the right one is caused by the process @xmath39 .",
    "the number of events for each process is found by fitting the histogram with the sum of three curves : @xmath40 , @xmath41 and the background of the @xmath38 process .",
    "the shape of the curves has been found from simulation based on matrix elements consistent with the simplest lorentz structure of the feynman diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fm_om ] and fig .",
    "[ fm_eta ] .",
    "the interference between diagrams with different charges of intermediate @xmath42 mesons and with transpositions of identical pions in the final state has been taken into account .",
    "simulation of the background process @xmath43 was performed according to ref .",
    "the procedure of statistical separation for events from different processes was checked by using simulation and the systematic error associated with this procedure was found to be negligible .",
    "the detection efficiency for our selection criteria was found to be 25% and 23% for @xmath3 and @xmath2 respectively , with no significant energy dependence .",
    "the radiative corrections for each process were calculated following ref .",
    "@xcite .    the value of the radiative correction varied with energy from -16.5% to -20.0% for each process .",
    "the number of signal events and corresponding cross sections are presented in table [ odin ] for each energy and shown in figs .",
    "[ om_sec ] and [ eta_sec ] in comparison with the results of other experiments  @xcite .",
    "the systematic uncertainty mainly comes from the difference in @xmath29 distributions for simulation and experimental data and was estimated as @xmath44% .",
    "our results for the cross section of the process @xmath45 are higher than those from dm2 , but they are not incompatible within the large statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "the cross section of the process @xmath46 agrees with the results of other measurements by nd and dm2 as well as with the preliminary results from cmd-2 @xcite obtained using the decay mode @xmath47 .",
    "the number of background events found in this way is consistent with the estimate based on the value of the cross section for the process @xmath48 obtained by cmd-2 @xcite .",
    "one can therefore conclude that the cross section of the five pion production is saturated by the @xmath3 and @xmath2 intermediate states .    to understand whether the data allow a small contribution from the @xmath49 final state other than @xmath3 or @xmath2 , the following analysis was carried out .",
    "a strict cut on @xmath50 was imposed considerably suppressing the background from @xmath33 .",
    "the expected shape of the @xmath32 distribution was determined from a simulation of the process @xmath51 assuming a constant matrix element .",
    "next a fit of the experimental distribution of @xmath32 was performed assuming all four contributions discussed above .",
    "results of this fit in terms of the upper limits on the possible contribution to the cross section of @xmath49 production at 95% confidence level are shown in the last column of table [ odin ] .",
    "one can see that these limits are typically much smaller than the @xmath3 cross section indicating the smallness of other intermediate mechanisms of @xmath49 production .",
    "results of the fit are shown in figs .",
    "[ om_sec ] , [ eta_sec ] and presented in table [ dwa ] . the @xmath29/n.d.f .",
    "value is equal to 15.1/19 and 37/31 for @xmath3 and @xmath2 respectively .",
    "hatched areas show separate contributions for each resonance .",
    "one can see that the contributions of @xmath52 for @xmath3 and @xmath53 for @xmath2 are negligible compared to the @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively and are not statistically significant .",
    "the fit with one resonance only was additionally performed which results in @xmath29/n.d.f = 23/23 and @xmath29/n.d.f = 43/35 for @xmath3 and @xmath56 respectively .    to estimate the possible variation of parameters we performed the fit of the @xmath3 cross section under the assumption that the total width is completely determined by the decay @xmath57 . in accordance with @xcite ,",
    "the branching ratio of the @xmath52 is dominated by the @xmath58 decay while for the @xmath54 it is about @xmath59 50 % , so that this assumption does not look completely unreasonable . in this case",
    "@xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the squared matrix element of the @xmath62 decay integrated over the phase space . @xmath63 as well as",
    "@xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are parameters of the fit .",
    "@xmath67 presented in tables  [ dwa ] and [ tri ] were calculated in accordance with the relation @xmath68 .",
    "the fit results of which are presented in table  [ tri ] has @xmath29/n.d.f = 13/19 indicating a good fit to this hypothesis . as one can conclude from comparison of table  [ dwa ] and table  [ tri ] , the parameters of the @xmath52 are more or less stable while for the @xmath54 the level of their variation is of the order of two standard deviations .",
    "more precise experimental information collected in the whole energy range from 1.4 to 2 gev is obviously necessary to determine unambiguously the properties of the @xmath42(770 ) and @xmath69(782 ) excitations .    .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the cross section of @xmath9 annihilation into five pions has been measured in the energy range 1.28 - 1.38 gev using the cmd-2 detector .",
    "the cross section is saturated by the contributions of @xmath3 and @xmath2 intermediate mechanisms .",
    "the energy dependence of the cross sections is compatible with the generally accepted pattern of two higher mass excitations for both @xmath42(770 ) and @xmath69(782 ) mesons , although an acceptable fit was obtained with one isoscalar and one isovector resonace only ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) .",
    "parameters of the resonances are rather model dependent and more detailed information at c.m .",
    "energies above 1.4 gev is required for their unambiguous determination",
