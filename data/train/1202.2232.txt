    "the holst action is an action used as a starting point to quantize gravity in theories employing real @xmath2 connection . in fact , holst term is much older then holst action formulation or even the loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) .",
    "it was first presented in @xcite as a possible extension of the hilbert - einstein action invariant under gauge symmetries ( e.g. lorentz and diffeomorphisms symmetries ) but breaking parity whenever the torsion is present .",
    "it turns out that the extension of the lagrangian density @xmath3 by the term @xmath4 which is proposed in this article is the only possible extension linear in r in the einstein - cartan framework .",
    "it was suggested at the end of @xcite that it would be interesting to extend the results to the supersymmetric case .",
    "such extension is presented at this work .",
    "the minimal / non - minimal coupling of the matter fields with spin-@xmath5 was already studied in the holst action framework by several authors @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the term with immirzi parameter becomes dynamical i.e. it appears in the equation of motion ( e.o.m . ) and the parity is violated as expected . however , in @xcite it has been shown that there is a coupling of fermions to the holst action which does not affect the equations of motion , where @xmath6 is the nieh - yan topological invariant and @xmath7 is a current of matter field .",
    "this property is more general and can be extended for derivations contained at this work .",
    "this turns out to be equivalent to the argument that if we take into account the terms quadratic in contorsion in the dynamical part of the action as well as in the holst term ( see [ appp ] ) , the immirzi parameter is not dynamical . ] . in spite of the interest in coupling fermions to the theory ,",
    "the supersymmetric holst action was studied only in @xcite as an extension of the holst bosonic lagrangian or in the @xcite where the supersymmetric holst action was obtained as a result of super ",
    "bf theory with constrains . in both cases",
    "it turned out that the holst term does not influence the e.o.m .",
    "as this work shows , these properties are general features of supersymmetric theories .    to clarify some misunderstanding in the role of the holst term and immirzi parameter",
    ", this paper will first recall the way of constructing holst term , then will shortly present the role of the immirzi parameter .",
    "the last part of this section is devoted to rudiments of general theory concerns the construction of the general parity violation term , based on the torsion equation . in the second part of this work",
    "the construction for higher supersymmetry will be presented and the super - holst action @xmath1 will be coupled , using the noether method , to scalar - spinor-@xmath5 , maxwell and yang  mills multiplet .",
    "the immirzi parameter was introduced by barbero @xcite and immirzi @xcite as a parameter which allows to introduce real @xmath2 connection is double covering of the group @xmath8 . ] instead of complex @xmath9 ashtekar connection @xcite in canonical quantization of general relativity .",
    "the construction follows from noticing that if one partially fixes the @xmath8 gauge freedom by \" time gauge  , what is left is the invariance under local @xmath10 , with frame space  like field @xmath11(@xmath12 are space indexes , and @xmath13 internal indices ) , and 3metric constructed from frame field @xmath14 .",
    "then one can construct a densitized triad @xmath15 .",
    "there are two connection present in this construction , a @xmath10 levi  civita connection @xmath16 and the connection @xmath17 ( the @xmath18 is a spin connection where @xmath19 ) conjugated to @xmath20 i.e. @xmath21 barbero and immirzi pointed out @xcite , that there exist a cannonical transformation of variables",
    "@xmath22 which results in a single non vanishing poissone brackets @xmath23 the parameter @xmath24 is called immirzi parameter and its presence ensures that the theory has a lorentzian signature as long as @xmath25 ( which is euclidean case ) .",
    "if one sets @xmath26 then one reconstructs the original ashtekar self / anti - self dual variables @xcite . for @xmath27",
    "the variables are real .",
    "the immirzi parameter also appears in a more general context in @xcite , where it was shown that by using the most general inner product on lie algebra @xmath28 @xmath29 and identifying @xmath30 , one gets a theory , that includes the immirzi parameter ) with boundary terms . ] .",
    "an action which leads to barbero formulation in hamiltonian framework @xcite is the action proposed in @xcite was introduced for simplification as it is a numerical factor . ]",
    "@xmath31 this action was proposed earlier @xcite in the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 governs the parity violating interaction .",
    "observe that the action ( [ holst ] ) is based on the barbero connection .",
    "one can take a variation of action @xmath34 where @xmath35 in the case where @xmath36 one can recognizes the ashtekar connection .",
    "if one uses the space - time decomposition of connection , i.e. @xmath37 and inserts it to the action , then it is easy to see that action depends exactly on the barbero connection @xmath38 with the identification @xmath39 .",
    "the construction of connection ( [ conss ] ) suggests how the holst term is constructed .",
    "it is built from terms belonging to the torsion equation i.e. from e.o.m .",
    "calculated under variation @xmath40 , multiplied by @xmath41 .",
    "the torsion equation has the following general structure @xmath42}\\,^j = d _ { [ \\mu } e_{\\nu ] } ^j = k _ { [ \\mu}\\,^{ij}e_{\\nu ] j}=-2k_{[\\mu\\nu]}\\,^i\\,.\\label{tortor}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the tensor @xmath43 is called contorsion and is defined as a difference between torsion and torsion - free connection @xmath44 in terms of spin connection it can be rewritten as @xmath45 the contorsion @xmath46 can be obtained from @xmath47}\\,^\\rho\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and can be expressed in term of torsion as @xmath48 the holst term can be constructed from torsion and contorsion tensor by the following contractions @xmath49 it arises from the ( [ conss ] ) that a variation with respect to @xmath50 is @xmath51 if one restricts oneself to a theory linear in @xmath3 and without any second covariant derivatives , the most general object of 3 indices ( 2 space - time and 1 internal ) which can be contracted via @xmath52 and gives the second part of ( [ rty ] ) @xmath53 is exactly ( [ hoholst ] ) .",
    "+ there are some comments on this construction .",
    "first , if matter fields are not included to lagrangian , there is no torsion @xcite . in the other words the torsion @xmath54}^\\lambda\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is antisymmetric in lower indices and there is no contorsion term @xmath55 . to get dynamical torsion , due to the fact that torsion couples to spin and gravity field",
    "has spin-2 , one can express contorsion field in a term of scalar field @xmath56 and ensure that this equation will be satisfied by adding it to the action via lagrange multiplier .",
    "however this procedure does not break parity symmetry @xcite . in the case of matter field",
    "the term ( [ hoholst ] ) bieng a pseudoscalar breaks parity .",
    "second comment is that there exist much more terms quadratic in contorsion which can be added to the action ( see @xcite ) , even the terms added in nondynamical manner , which results in the dynamical torsion i.e. terms with second derivatives of @xmath57 or equivalently , terms quadratic on the derivatives of @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "based on the construction ( [ hoholst ] ) , the supersymmetric extension can be found in @xcite ] of the holst action can be easily constructed and classified and in @xcite for sugra @xmath58 . ] . in the case of supergravity ( sugra ) expression in ( [ tortor ] )",
    "is called  super torsion  are internal indices , @xmath59 are space - time indices and @xmath60 numbers the different supersymmetric charges . ] .",
    "matter can be coupled in the supersymmetric manner i.e. in the way which ensure that the lagrangian will be invariant under supersymmetric , lorentz and diffeomorphisms transformations .",
    "the method of coupling is called the noether method and details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the brief review of the method @xcite for the scalar - spin-@xmath5 multiplet based on consideration of wess - zumino lagrangian which is scalar - spinor-@xmath5 theory with global supersymmetric invariance @xmath61 where @xmath62 is scalar , @xmath63 is pseudoscalar and @xmath64 is spin-@xmath65 spinor . if one replaces a global supersymmetric invariance with local , the coupling term , accurate to second order in coupling constant @xmath66 , can be expressed as @xmath67\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{8}i\\kappa^2(a \\bop[\\beta ] b)[e\\bar{\\chi}\\gamma_5\\gamma^\\beta\\chi-\\epsilon^{\\alpha\\beta\\mu\\tau}\\bar{\\psi}_\\alpha\\gamma_\\tau\\psi_\\mu]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the supersymmetric transformation , accurate to first order in @xmath66 , are @xmath68 @xmath69 b)+\\frac{\\kappa}{4}(\\chi\\gamma_5\\gamma^\\rho\\chi)(\\sigma_{\\mu\\rho}\\gamma_5\\epsilon)\\ ] ] @xmath70 @xmath71 the total lagrangian of supersymmetric gravity coupled to scalar multiplet is @xmath72\\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{8}i\\kappa^2(a \\bop[\\beta ] b)[e\\bar{\\chi}\\gamma_5\\gamma^\\beta\\chi-\\epsilon^{\\alpha\\beta\\mu\\tau}\\bar{\\psi}_\\alpha\\gamma_\\tau\\psi_\\mu]\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the equation of torsion can be calculated from ( [ l1 ] ) as @xmath73i}=\\bar{\\psi}_\\nu\\gamma_i\\psi_\\rho+\\frac{1}{e}e^\\mu_i\\epsilon_{\\nu\\rho\\mu\\sigma}\\bar{\\chi}\\gamma^\\sigma\\chi\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the construction ( [ hoholst ] ) the holst term reads @xmath74 one can couple the maxwell field using exactly the same procedure @xcite .",
    "the action for coupled abelian field in supersymmetric way is @xmath75 one can recognize the two connections , a spin connection and an abelian connection , but the impact to super torsion equation is given only by a spin connection and it looks exactly the same as ( [ tt2 ] ) .    if one considers a yang ",
    "mills multipled given by the lagrangian @xmath76 than immediately will see , that using non - abelian matter fields instead of abelian do not influence to torsion equation ( [ tt2 ] ) . therefore , it is a general observation that holst term in the scalar - spin-@xmath5 , maxwell and yang ",
    "mills theory has the same form of ( [ holhol ] ) .",
    "it is possible to formulate general theory , which is valid for any supersymmetric matter couple to sugra n=1 and for any higher sugra ( n=1,2,4,8 ) .",
    "[ t2 ] the holst term constructed in sugra @xmath0 and sugra @xmath1 coupled to matter is invariant under supersymmetric , lorentz and diffeomorphisms transformation and does not influence the field equations .",
    "the torsion equation has a general form @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a number of different matter sources present in a theory . using the construction ( [ hoholst ] ) the holst term reads @xmath79 one can notices that any arbitrary infinitesimal variation of this lagrangian @xmath80 vanishes according to torsion equation ( [ heh ] ) .",
    "one can realize that in the supersymmetry theories the terms depending on immirzi parameter are not dynamical . this result is much different from many works on coupling spinor fileds to gravity @xcite .",
    "therefore , the understanding of the difference is very instructive .",
    "usually , the strategy of coupling matter field to holst action is based on adding the matter lagrangian with some coupling constants .",
    "the significant is that the matter field does not contribute the holst action .",
    "if one calculates the torsion equation then immediately realizes that it has some impact to torsion  free connection i.e. contorsion , and contorsion depend on the immirzi parameter .",
    "solution of this equation gives the new connection ( [ omee ] ) , which contribute to action by some additional terms ( see ( [ a3 ] ) in the appendix ) e.g. @xmath81 , which appear in e.o.m .",
    "strategy presented in this work assumes that the holst term is constructed according to construction ( [ hoholst ] ) , which ensures that holst term will be supersymmetric ( using theorem [ t2 ] ) , as the theory without holst term has to be supersymmetric by itself .",
    "then if super torsion equation is calculated , contorsion tensor will not depend on immirzi parameter anymore .",
    "therefore , the action with additional terms ( [ a2 ] , [ a3 ] ) also does not depend on immirzi parameter .",
    "thus one can see that the assumption of supersymmetry does not allow appearance of the immirzi parameter in e.o.m",
    ".    however , considering the additional term @xcite in the super ",
    "holst action is very interesting according to the interpretation of immirzi parameter as a regulator of the quantum fluctuations of the vanishing torsion condition .",
