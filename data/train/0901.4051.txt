    "interestingly , constructing complete sets of mu bases is equivalent to finding an orthogonal decomposition of the lie algebra @xmath15 , which poses a long - standing open problem whenever @xmath2 is not a prime power @xcite .",
    "let us summarize what is know about the ( non- ) existence of mu bases in composite dimensions .",
    "there are a few _ analytic _ results :    * it is possible to construct _ three _ mu bases in @xmath13 without reference to the value of @xmath2 @xcite ; hence , three mu bases do exist for any composite dimension @xmath2 ; * there are at least @xmath16 mu bases if @xmath17 , the smallest factor of the prime decomposition of @xmath2 , occurs @xmath18 times @xcite ; * more than @xmath16 mu bases are known exist for specific values of @xmath2 ; for example , if @xmath19 , a total of @xmath20 @xmath21 mu bases have been identified @xcite .",
    "attempts to generalize number - theoretic formul  used in the construction of complete mu bases from prime - power dimensions to composite dimensions fail @xcite .",

    "again , no more than two mu hadamard matrices emerge , giving rise to at most three mu bases ; it is thus impossible to base the construction of a complete set on the heisenberg - weyl group .    the strategy of this paper will be to generalize grassl s approach by removing the restriction that the second mu basis be related to the heisenberg - weyl group .",
    "instead , we will consider many different choices for the second mu basis , thoroughly sampling the set of currently known complex hadamard matrices .",

    "[ results ] presents our findings which we obtain by applying the algorithm to nearly 6000 hadamard matrices of dimension six .",
    "conclusions are drawn in the final section .",
    "traditionally , a hadamard matrix @xmath4 in dimension @xmath2 is understood to have elements @xmath25 only and to satisfy the condition @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the identity . in the context of mu bases , it is customary to call @xmath4 a _ hadamard _ matrix if it is unitary and its matrix elements are of the form @xmath28 the @xmath2 vectors formed by the columns of such a matrix provide an orthonormal basis of @xmath13 .",
    "each of these vectors is mutually unbiased with respect to the standard basis , naturally associated with the identity matrix @xmath27 .",
    "it is convenient to identify a hadamard matrix with the mu basis formed by its columns .",
    "two hadamard matrices are _ equivalent _ to each other , @xmath29 , if one can be obtained from the other by permutations of its columns and its rows , and by the multiplication of its columns and rows with individual phase factors .",
    "explicitly , the equivalence relation reads @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are _ monomial _ matrices , i.e. they are unitary and have only one nonzero element in each row and column .",
    "consequently , each hadamard matrix is equivalent to a _ dephased _ hadamard matrix , the first row and column of which have entries @xmath5 only .",
    "all ( complex ) hadamard matrices are known for dimensions @xmath33 but there is no exhaustive classification for @xmath34 .",
    "it is useful to briefly describe the hadamard matrices known to exist in dimension six since we will ` parametrize ' the search for mu bases in terms of hadamard matrices .",
    "we use the notation introduced in @xcite the authors of which maintain an online catalog of hadamard matrices @xcite .    each point in fig .",
    "[ allhadamards ] , an updated version of a figure presented in @xcite , corresponds to one hadamard matrix of dimension six , except for the interior of the upper circle where a point represents two hadamard matrices ( cf .",
    "there is one _ isolated point _ , representing the spectral matrix @xmath35 given in @xcite , also known as tao s matrix @xcite .",
    "three sets of hadamard matrices labeled by a _ single parameter _ are known : the di family @xmath36 introduced in @xcite , a family of symmetric matrices denoted by @xmath37 @xcite and the family of all hermitean hadamard matrices @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "two _ two - parameter _ families of hadamard matrices are known to arise from discrete fourier - type transformations @xmath39 in @xmath22 , and from their transpositions , @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "the szllsi family @xmath41 is the only other known two - parameter set @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the matrix @xmath42 can be shown to be equivalent to @xmath43 , and there is a second possibility to define a matrix at this point , giving rise to @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "we have noticed that such a doubling actually occurs for _ all _ values of the parameters @xmath45 leading to a set of hadamard matrices @xmath46 inequivalent to @xmath41 .",
    "hence , the interior of the upper circle in fig .",
    "[ allhadamards ] represents two layers of hadamard matrices which are glued together at the boundary of the circle .",
    "topologically , the szllsi family @xmath41 and the set @xmath46 thus combine to form the surface of a sphere .",
    "appendix [ defnhadamards ] lists the explicit forms of hadamard matrices as well as the parameter ranges which have been reduced to their _ fundamental regions _ using the equivalence relation (    [ equivalence ] ) .",
    "[ allhadamards ] also shows equivalences between hadamard matrices simultaneously belonging to different families .",
    "the circulant hadamard matrix @xmath47 @xcite , for example , embeds into the hermitean family which in turn is given by the boundary of the szllsi families . lining up some of the points where different families overlap suggests that we arrange the hadamard matrices in a symmetrical way .",
    "there are two reasons for this : for the di , hermitean and symmetric families , a reflection about the line passing through the points @xmath48 and @xmath35 maps @xmath49 to @xmath50 , while the same reflection sends @xmath49 to @xmath51 if the matrix @xmath49 is a member of the di , hermitean or fourier families ; for the szllsi family , the reflection about the vertical axis must be supplemented by a change of layer in order to get from @xmath41 to @xmath46 .",
    "let us finally mention that the known families of hadamard matrices come in two different types , _ affine _ and _ non - affine _ ones .",

    "in this section , we make explicit the conditions on a vector @xmath22 to be mu with respect to the standard matrix and a fixed hadamard matrix , i.e. tothe pair @xmath57 .",
    "then we outline an algorithm to construct _ all _ solutions of the resulting multivariate polynomial equations , allowing us to check how many additional mu hadamard matrices do exist .",
    "we illustrate this approach by constructing a complete set of _ four _ mu bases in dimension @xmath23 , and we reproduce grassl s result for @xmath24 in order to explain that this approach produces rigorous results in spite of inevitable numerical approximations .      a vector @xmath58 is mu with respect to the standard basis ( associated with the columns of the identity @xmath27 ) if each of its components has modulus @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath59 is mu with respect to a fixed hadamard matrix @xmath4 if @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the state associated with the @xmath62 column @xmath63 of @xmath4 , @xmath64 .",
    "let us express these conditions on @xmath59 in terms of its components @xmath65 , written as @xmath66 where @xmath67 are @xmath68 real parameters .",
    "the overall phase of the state @xmath59 is irrelevant which allows us to fix the phase of its first component .",
    "then , the first set of constraints on the state @xmath59 reads @xmath69 and the second set is given by @xmath70 where the state @xmath61 has components @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
