    "in the neighborhood of a second order phase transition various quantities diverge .",
    "for example the correlation length , which characterizes the decay of the two - point correlation function , behaves as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the reduced temperature , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the amplitudes in the high and the low temperature phase , respectively , and @xmath12 is the critical exponent of the correlation length .",
    "these power laws are affected by confluent corrections , such as @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and non - confluent ones such as @xmath16 .",
    "critical exponents such as @xmath12 and ratios of amplitudes such as @xmath17 are universal .",
    "this means that they assume exactly the same value for any system within a given universality class .",
    "also correction exponents such as @xmath18 and ratios of correction amplitudes as @xmath19 are universal .",
    "a universality class is characterized by the dimension of the system , the range of the interaction and the symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "the critical exponents @xmath20 of the specific heat , @xmath21 of the magnetic susceptibility , @xmath22 of the two - point correlation function at the critical point , @xmath12 of the correlation length , @xmath23 of the magnetization at the critical temperature as a function of the external field and @xmath24 of the spontaneous magnetization at a vanishing external field are related by so called scaling and hyperscaling relations .",
    "this allows to deduce all of them from two independent exponents . for reviews on critical phenomena and the renormalization group ( rg )",
    "see e.g. @xcite .    here",
    "we are concerned with three dimensions , short range interactions and a @xmath25 symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "the best know model undergoing a phase transition in this universality class is the spin-1/2 ising model in three dimensions with nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "therefore this universality class is called the three - dimensional ising universality class .",
    "this universality class is supposed to be realized in a huge range of experimental systems : binary mixtures , uniaxial magnets or micellar systems ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "typically the estimates of critical exponents extracted from experimental data are less accurate than those obtained by using the theoretical methods discussed below .",
    "for example , recent experimental estimates obtained from turbidity data for a methanol - cyclohexane mixture are @xmath26 and @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "critical exponents and amplitude ratios have been computed by various theoretical methods such as field theoretic methods or high temperature series expansions and monte carlo simulations of lattice models .",

    "in addition we report the value of @xmath21 that can be compared with the results of the high temperature series expansions reported below .",
    "typically , the errors reported for the critical exponents obtained from the perturbative expansion in @xmath31 are smaller than those obtained from the @xmath28-expansion . while the estimates for @xmath12 are all consistent within the quoted errors , clear variations can be observed for @xmath22 , @xmath21 and @xmath33 . for a discussion of the different resummation schemes that have been used , we refer the reader to ref .",

    "note that , as discussed by nickel @xcite , the subleading correction exponent @xmath89 @xcite also plays a crucial role in the analysis of the perturbative series in three dimensions fixed .",
    "therefore , it would be highly desirable to get an estimate of @xmath91 by using a different method .    using monte carlo simulations , the error of the estimates of the critical exponents",
    "can be further reduced just by spending more cpu time . to this end",
    "one has to increase the statistics as well as enlarge the size of the lattices that are simulated . keeping the statistical error and the systematical one proportional , the effort increases as @xmath92 with a decreasing error , where the first factor @xmath93 is related to the increased statistics and the second to the larger linear lattice size @xmath94 that is needed to reduce the systematical error .",
    "here we assume that the systematical error is proportional to @xmath95 , since , as we have shown here , leading corrections can be eliminated .",

    "this is about a factor of 30 more cpu time than we have spent here .",
