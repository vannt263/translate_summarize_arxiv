    "the interest in such small objects is due to the appearance of new effects if the size of the system is comparable to some characteristic length . in case of superconductors",
    "it means that the sample should have one size at least of order the coherence length @xmath3 ( such superconductors are called mesoscopic superconductors ) . for example , only for hollow cylinders or rings of radius @xmath4 it is possible to observe the famous little - parks oscillations @xcite .",

    ", we found that the vorticity @xmath30 of the final state of the ring depends on the value of @xmath20 and is not necessary equal to @xmath56 .",
    "the larger @xmath20 the larger the vorticity after the transition .",
    "the final state is reached in the following manner .",
    "when the magnetic field increases the order parameter decreases ( see inset of fig .",

    "this time scale is taken as the time in which the value of the order parameter decreases from 1 to 0.4 in its minimal point .",
    "when the order parameter reaches the value @xmath57 in its minimal point the process speeds up considerably and the order parameter starts to oscillate in time at this point along the ring ( see fig .",

    "oscillatory behavior of the superconducting @xmath58 ( fig .",
    "2(b ) ) and the normal @xmath59 ( fig .",
    "2(c ) ) current density is found at the point where the minimal value of the order parameter is found . at other places in the ring such oscillatory behavior",

    "nonzero values of @xmath65 near the moment of the phase slip is connected with the finite coordinate and time step used in the numerical calculations.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in fig .",
    "3 the dependence on @xmath20 of the dynamics of @xmath65 in the minimal point is illustrated .",
    "note that with increasing value of @xmath20 the number of phase slips ( or equivalently the number of oscillations of the order parameter at its minimal point ) increases and hence @xmath48 also increases .",
    "another important property is that the amplitude of those oscillations decreases with increasing @xmath20 .",
    "the above results lead us to conclude that in a supeconducting ring there are two characteristics time scales .",
    "first , there is the relaxation time of the absolute value of the order parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the second time scale is determined by the time between the phase slips ( ps ) , i.e. the period of oscillation of the value of the order parameter in its minimal point ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . below",
    "we show that the latter time is directly proportional to the time of change of the phase of the order parameter @xmath1 and is connected to the relaxation time of the charge imbalance in the system .    in fig .",
    "4 the distribution of the absolute value of the order parameter @xmath66 and the gauge - invariant momentum @xmath36 are shown near the point where the first phase - slip occurs for a ring with radius @xmath42 and @xmath45 at different times : just before and after the first ps which occurs at @xmath67 . before the moment of the phase",
    "slip the order parameter decreases while after the ps it increases . in order to understand this different behavior",
    "let us rewrite eq .",
    "( 1a ) separately for the absolute value @xmath65 and the phase @xmath68 of the order parameter    @xmath69    here @xmath70 is the arc - coordinate along the ring and we used the condition @xmath71 .",
    "it is obvious from eq .",
    "( 4a ) that if the rhs of eq .",
    "( 4a ) is negative @xmath65 decreases in time and if the rhs is positive @xmath65 will increase in time .",
    "because the second derivative of @xmath65 is always positive ( at least near the phase - slip center - see fig .",
    "4(a ) ) the different time dependence of @xmath65 is governed by the term @xmath72 . from fig .",
    "4(b ) it is clear that after the phase slip the value of @xmath36 is less than before this moment , with practically the same distribution of @xmath65 .",
    "it is this fact which is responsible for an increase of the order parameter just after the moment of the phase slip .",
    "but at some moment of time the momentum @xmath36 can become sufficiently large , making the rhs of eq .",
    "( 4a ) negative and as a consequence @xmath65 starts to decrease .     and with @xmath45 .",
    "the phase slip occurs at @xmath67.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    based on our numerical calculations we may state that for every value of the order parameter in the minimal point , there exists a critical value of the momentum @xmath73 such that if the value of the momentum in this point is less than @xmath73 the order parameter will increase in time . in the opposite case the order parameter decreases which leads ultimately to the phase slip process .",
    "therefore , when after a phase slip @xmath36 increases fast enough such that at some moment the condition @xmath74 is fulfilled , the order parameter will start to decrease which leads than to a new phase slip process .    from our results",
    "we can conclude that the change of @xmath36 ( or phase of the order parameter ) with time and of @xmath65 with time has a different dependence on @xmath20 . indeed from figs . 2 and 3 it follows that with increasing @xmath20 the time relaxation of @xmath65 becomes larger with respect to the relaxation time for @xmath36 ( for example",
    ", the amplitude of oscillations of @xmath65 is decreased ) . moreover",
    ", the relaxation time for @xmath36 depends not only on @xmath20 but also on the history of the system : the larger the number of phase slips which have occurred in the system the longer the time becomes between the next two subsequent phase slips . in order to understand such behavior we turn to eq .",
    "( 4b ) .",
    "the numerical analysis shows that the second term in the rhs of eq .",
    "( 4b ) is only important for some length near the phase slip center .",
    "this length is nothing else than the length over which the electric field penetrates the superconductor .",
    "we checked this directly by solving eqs .",
    "( 1a , b ) for this situation . but",
    "this length is the decay length @xmath75 of the charge imbalance in the superconductor ( see for example refs .",
    "we numerically found that @xmath75 varies with @xmath20 ( in the range @xmath76 ) as @xmath77 .",
    "it means that the relaxation time of the charge imbalance is @xmath78 .",
    "lets take the derivative @xmath79 on both side of eq .",
    "( 4b ) and integrate it over a distance of @xmath75 near the ps center ( far from it we have @xmath80 ) we obtain the josephson relation ( in dimensionless units ) @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the phase difference over the phase slip center which leads to the voltage @xmath83 and where @xmath84 is the normal current ( or electric field in our units ) in the point of the phase slip .",
    "( 5 ) it follows immediately that the relaxation time for the phase of the order parameter near the phase slip center is @xmath85 where @xmath86 means averaging over time between two consecutive phase slips .",
    "this result allows us to qualitatively explain our numerical results . indeed , from fig .",
    "2(c ) it is apparent that @xmath87 decreases after each ps and as a result it leads to an increase of @xmath1 . with increasing @xmath20 ,",
    "@xmath75 decreases and @xmath1 increases . fitting our data",
    "( see fig .",
    "5 ) leads to the dependencies @xmath88 and @xmath89 for rings with radius @xmath42 and @xmath46 , respectively ( here @xmath1 was defined as the time between the first and the second phase slip ) .",
    "this is close to the expected dependencies which follow from eq .",
    "( 6 ) and from the above dependence of @xmath90 ( quantitative differences follows from uncertainty in our finding @xmath1 and @xmath75 ) . besides , eq .",
    "( 6 ) allows us to explain the decrease of @xmath1 with increasing radius of the ring ( see inset in fig .",
    "namely , during the time between two phase slips the gauge - invariant momentum decreases as @xmath91 ( because @xmath92 increases as @xmath93 ) in the system .",
    "far from the phase slip center the total current practically is equal to @xmath94 . because @xmath71 in the ring we directly obtain that during this time the normal current density in the point of the phase slip also decreases as @xmath95 . taking into account eq .",
    "( 6 ) we can conclude that @xmath1 should vary as @xmath95 ( at least for a large radius and for the first phase slip ) . the behavior shown in the inset of fig .",
    "5 is very close to such a dependence ( it is interesting to note that in contrast to @xmath1 the time @xmath0 does practically not depend on @xmath27 ) .    on the basis of our results we can make the following statement : when the period of oscillation ( time of change of the phase of the order parameter ) becomes of the order , or larger , than the relaxation time of the absolute value of the order parameter the next phase slip becomes impossible in the system .",
    "this result can be applied to the system of ref .",
    "@xcite where a current carrying wire was studied .",
    "the authors found a critical current @xmath96 for @xmath24 and @xmath97 for @xmath23 . from our observation",
    "follows that the phase slip solution may be realized as a stable solution when @xmath98 .",
    "we found that @xmath77 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 which leads to the critical current @xmath101 which decreases with increasing @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "above we found that the time scale governing the change in the phase does not coincide with the relaxation time of the absolute value of the order parameter .",
    "this difference is essentially connected with the presence of an electrostatic potential in the system . in order to demonstrate this we performed the following numerical experiment .",
    "we neglected @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( 1a ) and found that the number of ps is now independent of @xmath20 and @xmath27 , and @xmath48 equals unity .",
    "moreover , it turned out that the time scale @xmath102 is an order of magnitude larger .",
    "this clearly shows that the electrostatic potential is responsible for the appearance of a second characteristic time which results in the above mentioned effects .    in an earlier paper @xcite the question of the selection of the metastable state",
    "was already discussed for the case of a superconducting ring . however , these authors neglected the effect of the electrostatic potential and found that transitions with @xmath103 can occur only when the magnetic field ( called the induced electro - moving force ( emf ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ) increases very quickly .",
    "in their case these transitions were connected to the appearance of several nodes in @xmath66 along the perimeter of the ring and in each node a single ps occurred .",
    "we reproduced those results and found such transitions also for larger values of @xmath53 . however , simple estimates show that in order to realize such a situation in practice it is necessary to have an extremely large ramp of the magnetic field .",
    "for example , for @xmath5 mesoscopic samples with @xmath104 and @xmath62 the corresponding ramp should be about @xmath105 .",
    "with such a ramp the induced normal currents in the ring are so large that heating effects will suppress superconductivity .",
    "( curves 1,2 ) , the relaxation time of the order parameter @xmath0 , ( which for definiteness we defined as the time of variation of the order parameter from @xmath64 till the first ps - curves 3,4 ) and the relaxation time of the phase of the order parameter @xmath1 ( we defined it here as the time between the first and second ps - curves 5,6 ) are shown as function of the parameter @xmath20 .",
    "dotted(solid ) curves are for a ring with radius @xmath106 .",
    "dashed curve corresponds to the relaxation time of the charge imbalance ( as obtained from the expression @xmath107 ) . in the inset",
    ", the dependency of @xmath1 on the ring radius is shown for different values of the parameter @xmath20.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    the transitions between the metastable states in the ring are not only determined by @xmath20 and @xmath27 , but also , the presence of defects play a crucial role .",
    "their existence leads to a decrease of @xmath48 .",
    "this is mainly connected to the fact that with decreasing @xmath37 ( as a result of the presence of a defect ) the value of @xmath87 decreases even at the moment of the first phase slip ( because @xmath87 can not be larger than @xmath108 ) and hence @xmath1 increases .",
    "we can also explain this in terms of a decreasing degeneracy of the system .",
    "for example , if we decrease @xmath37 with a factor of two ( e.g. by the presence of defects ) it leads to a twice smaller value for @xmath109 and @xmath56 .",
    "but our numerical analysis showed that the effect of defects is not only restricted to a decrease of @xmath37 and @xmath56 . to show this we simulated a defect by inserting an inclusion of another material with less or zero @xmath110 .",
    "this is done by inserting in the rhs of eq .",
    "( 1a ) an additional term @xmath111 where @xmath112 is zero except inside the defect where @xmath113 .",
    "the magnetic field was increased up to @xmath35 of the ideal ring case .",
    "we found that the number of ps was smaller as compared to the case of a ring without defects .",
    "the calculations was done for defects such that @xmath37 was decreased by less than a factor of 2 in comparison to the ideal ring case .",
    "in contrast , a similar calculation for a ring with nonuniform thickness / width showed that , even for weak nonuniformity ( which decreases @xmath37 by less than @xmath114 ) , @xmath115 was larger than for the ideal ring case and the final vorticity approaches @xmath56 .",
    "this remarkable difference between the situation for a defect and the case of a nonuniformity may be traced back to the difference in the distribution of the order parameter : even in the absence of an external magnetic field the defect leads to a nonuniform distribution of the order parameter which is not so for the nonuniform ring case .",
    "a more thorough study of the effect of defects will be presented elsewhere .",
    "all the above results were based on a one - dimensional model which contains the essential physics of the decay and recovery of the superconducting state in a ring from a metastable state to its final state .",
    "however , even in the case when the effect of the self - field can be neglected the finite width of the ring may still lead to important additional effects ( for example , a finite critical magnetic field ) . in order to include the finite width of the ring into our calculation we considered the following model .",
    "we took a ring of mean radius @xmath116 , width @xmath117 , and thickness less than @xmath3 and @xmath6 .",
    "these parameters are close to those of the ring studied experimentally in ref .",
    "@xcite and they are such that we can still neglect the self - field of the ring .",
    "the obtained magnetization curves of such a ring are shown in fig .",
    "6 as function of the magnetic field and for two values of @xmath20 .",
    "those results were obtained from a numerical solution of the two - dimensional ginzburg - landau equations , eqs .",
    "( 1a , b ) .",
    "the magnetic field was changed with steps @xmath53 over a time interval which is larger than the initial part of the phase slip process @xmath102 ( for our parameters this procedure leads practically to an adiabatic change of the magnetic field ) .    from fig .",
    "6 we notice that the value of the vorticity jumps , @xmath48 , depends sensitively on the parameter @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "we found that the phase slips occur in one particular place along the perimeter of the ring .",
    "however , in contrast to our previous one - dimensional case , @xmath48 depends also on the applied magnetic field .",
    "the reason is that for a finite width ring the number of metastable states decreases with increasing magnetic field ( see ref .",
    "it means that the system can not be moved far from equilibrium with a large superconducting current density ( because the order parameter is strongly suppressed by the external field ) at high magnetic field .",
    "hence , the value of @xmath87 will be much smaller in comparison with the one at low magnetic fields and @xmath1 is larger or comparable with @xmath0 even for high values of @xmath20 and even for the first ps .",
    "thus , the effect of a large magnetic field in case of a finite width ring is similar , to some respect , to the effect of defects for a one - dimensional ring .",
    "our numerical results are in _ qualitative _ agreement with the experimental results of pedersen _ et al . _",
    "( see fig .",
    "@xcite ) . unfortunately ,",
    "no _ quantitative _ comparison is possible because of a number of unknowns , e.g. the value of @xmath37 ( it is necessary to have the dependence of @xmath118 as obtained starting from zero magnetic field ) , the value of @xmath3 is not accurately known and hence the ratio @xmath119 can therefore only be estimated .",
    "the value of both these parameters have a strong influence on the value of the vorticity jumps @xmath48 .    .",
    "the results are shown for a sweep up and sweep down of the magnetic field.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    let us discuss now finite temperature and screening effects ( i.e. finite @xmath6 ) .",
    "nonzero temperature leads to the possibility of a perturbative appearance of phase slip centers at @xmath120 .",
    "but if the field @xmath121 does not differ too much from @xmath35 the average @xmath87 is not altered strongly . as a result , after the appearance of the first thermo - activated ps center the second phase slip may appear automatically ( if the ratio @xmath2 is large enough ) which leads to an avalanche - type of process .",
    "unfortunately , it is impossible to apply the results of ref .",
    "@xcite in order to calculate the probability of this process even for the first ps .",
    "the reason is that in ref .",
    "@xcite the effect of the electrostatic potential ( which play a crucial role as was mentioned above ) was neglected .",
    "a finite @xmath6 ( and large enough width of the ring ) leads to a nonuniform distribution of the momentum @xmath36 over the width of the ring which can play an important role on the above considered effects .",
    "as we mentioned above such a finite width ring may be modelled as a strip with transport current in an external magnetic field . in ref .",
    "@xcite the condition for the entry of the first vortices in a narrow superconducting strip was studied .",
    "it turned out , that the period of vortex chain entry depends essentially on the distribution of @xmath36 over the width of the strip .",
    "when this distribution is uniform the period is infinite .",
    "but even small nonuniformities in this distribution leads to a finite period .",
    "if we translate their results to our ring geometry , the period of the vortex chain must now be discrete @xmath122 ( @xmath123 ) . under a certain condition",
    "the entry of vortices becomes possible , not through a single point along the perimeter , but through two , three and more points ( without increasing the ramp of the magnetic field ) .",
    "a finite @xmath6 only increases this effect because it leads to larger nonuniformities in the dependence of @xmath36 over the ring width .",
    "in this situation there is a competition between the process of the appearance of additional nodes along the ring perimeter and the number of ps in these points . at high magnetic fields",
    "these effects becomes negligible small ( because superconductivity only exists near the edges and the ring effectively can be considered as two one - dimensional rings ) and we will have the situation as discussed in the present work , and , recently in @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we studied how an unstable superconducting state of a superconducting ring evolves in time and transit to its final state .",
    "the latter is not necessary the thermodynamic equilibrium state and may be another metastable state with a different vorticity but which is stable in time .",
    "the transition between the different superconducting states occurs through a phase slip center which is a point along the ring where the superconducting amplitude decreases to zero abruptly resulting in the change of the vorticity of the superconducting state with one unit .",
    "the waiting time , or the creation time for the first phase slip , is found to be two orders of magnitude larger than the subsequent time intervals between consecutive phase slips .",
    "the latter time is connected with the time relaxation of the charge imbalance in the superconductor and increases the closer the system becomes to the final state .",
    "this circumstance allows to find this time ( also as the relaxation time of the absolute value of the order parameter ) from magnetic measurements of superconducting rings of large radius .",
