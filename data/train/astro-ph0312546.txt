    "historically , redshift surveys have provided the data and the test ground for much of the research on the nature of clustering and the distribution of galaxies . in the past few years",
    ", observations of large scale structure have improved greatly . today , with the development of fibre - fed spectrographs that can simultaneously measure spectra of hundreds of galaxies , cosmologists have at their fingertips large redshift surveys such as 2 degree field ( 2df ) and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "the analysis of these redshift surveys yield invaluable cosmological information . on the quantitative side , with the assumption that the galaxy distribution arises from the gravitational instability of small fluctuations generated in the early universe ,",
    "a wide range of statistical measurements can be obtained , such as the power spectrum and bispectrum .",
    "furthermore , a qualitative understanding of galaxy distribution provides insight into the mechanisms of structure formation that generate the complex pattern of sheets and filaments comprising the ` cosmic web ' ( bond , kofman & pogosyan 1996 ) we observe and allows us to map a wide variety of structure , including clusters , superclusters and voids .    today , many more redshifts are available for galaxies than direct distance measurements .",
    "this discrepancy inspired a great deal of work on methods for reconstruction of the real - space density field from that observed in redshift - space .",
    "these methods use a variety of functional representations ( e.g. cartesian , fourier , spherical harmonics or wavelets ) and smoothing techniques ( e.g. a gaussian sphere or a wiener filter ) .",
    "there are physical as well as practical reasons why one would be interested in smoothing the observed density field .",
    "it is often assumed that the galaxy distribution samples the underlying smooth density field and the two are related by a proportionality constant , the so - called linear bias parameter , @xmath3 .",
    "the finite sampling of the smooth underlying field introduces poisson ` shot noise . '",
    "any robust reconstruction technique must reliably mitigate the statistical uncertainties due to shot noise .",
    "moreover , in redshift surveys , the actual number of galaxies in a given volume is larger than the number observed , in particular in magnitude limited samples where at large distances only very luminous galaxies can be seen .    in this paper , we analyse large scale structure in the 2 degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs , colless 2001 ) , which has now obtained the redshifts for approximately 230,000 galaxies .",
    "we recover the underlying density field , characterised by an assumed power spectrum of fluctuations , from the observed field which suffers from incomplete sky coverage ( described by the angular mask ) and incomplete galaxy sampling due to its magnitude limit ( described by the selection function ) .",
    "the filtering is achieved by a wiener filter ( wiener 1949 , press 1992 ) within the framework of both linear and non - linear theory of density fluctuations .",
    "the wiener filter is optimal in the sense that the variance between the derived reconstruction and the underlying true density field is minimised . as opposed to _",
    "ad hoc _ smoothing schemes , the smoothing due to the wiener filter is determined by the data . in the limit of high signal - to - noise",
    ", the wiener filter modifies the observed data only weakly , whereas it suppresses the contribution of the data contaminated by shot noise .",
    "the wiener filtering is a well known technique and has been applied to many fields in astronomy ( see rybicki & press 1992 ) .",
    "for example , the method was used to reconstruct the angular distribution ( lahav 1994 ) , the real - space density , velocity and gravitational potential fields of the 1.2 jy-@xmath4 ( fisher 1995 ) and @xmath4 pscz surveys ( schmoldt 1999 ) .",
    "the wiener filter was also applied to the reconstruction of the angular maps of the cosmic microwave background temperature fluctuations ( bunn 1994 , tegmark & efstathiou 1995 , bouchet & gispert 1999 ) .",
    "a detailed formalism of the wiener filtering method as it pertains to the large scale structure reconstruction can be found in zaroubi ( 1995 ) .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : we begin with a brief review of the formalism of the wiener filter method .",
    "a summary of 2dfgrs data set , the survey mask and the selection function are given in section 3 .",
    "in section 4 , we outline the scheme used to pixelise the survey . in section 5 ,",
    "we give the formalism for the covariance matrix used in the analysis .",
    "after that , we describe the application of the wiener filter method to 2dfgrs and present detailed maps of the reconstructed field . in section 7",
    ", we identify the superclusters and voids in the survey .    throughout this paper , we assume a @xmath5cdm cosmology with @xmath6 and @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "in this section , we give a brief description of the wiener filter method . for more details ,",
    "we refer the reader to zaroubi ( 1995 ) .",
    "let s assume that we have a set of measurements , @xmath9 which are a linear convolution of the true underlying signal , @xmath10 , plus a contribution from statistical noise , @xmath11 , such that @xmath12 the wiener filter is defined as the _ linear _ combination of the observed data which is closest to the true signal in a minimum variance sense .",
    "more explicitly , the wiener filter estimate , @xmath13 , is given by @xmath14 where the filter is chosen to minimise the variance of the residual field , @xmath15 : @xmath16    it is straightforward to show that the wiener filter is given by @xmath17 where the first term on the right hand side is the signal - data correlation matrix ; @xmath18 and the second term is the data - data correlation matrix ; @xmath19    in the above equations , we have assumed that the signal and noise are uncorrelated . from equations  [ wienerfilter ] and  [ ddcor ] ,",
    "it is clear that , in order to implement the wiener filter , one must construct a _",
    "prior _ which depends on the mean of the signal ( which is 0 by construction ) and the variance of the signal and noise .",
    "the assumption of a prior may be alarming at first glance .",
    "however , slightly inaccurate values of wiener filter will only introduce second order errors to the full reconstruction ( see rybicki & press 1992 ) .",
    "the dependence of the wiener filter on the prior can be made clear by defining signal and noise matrices as @xmath20 and @xmath21 . with this notation",
    ", we can rewrite the equations above so that @xmath22 is given as @xmath23^{-1 } { \\bf d}. \\qquad \\label{swfvec}\\ ] ] the mean square residual given in equation  [ vares ] can then be calculated as @xmath24^{-1 } { \\bf n}. \\qquad \\label{res}\\ ] ]    formulated in this way , we see that the purpose of the wiener filter is to attenuate the contribution of low signal - to - noise ratio data .",
    "the derivation of the wiener filter given above follows from the sole requirement of minimum variance and requires only a model for the variance of the signal and noise .",
    "the wiener filter can also be derived using the laws of conditional probability if the underlying distribution functions for the signal and noise are assumed to be gaussian . for the gaussian prior ,",
    "the wiener filter estimate is both the maximum _ posterior _ estimate and the mean field ( see zaroubi 1995 ) .",
    "as several authors point out ( e.g. rybicki & press 1992 , zaroubi 2002 ) , the wiener filter is a biased estimator since it predicts a null field in the absence of good data , unless the field itself has zero mean . since we constructed the density field to have zero mean , we are not worried about this bias .",
    "however , the observed field deviates from zero due to selection effects and so one needs to be aware of this bias in the reconstructions .",
    "it is well known that the peculiar velocities of galaxies distort clustering pattern in redshift space . on small scales ,",
    "the random peculiar velocity of each galaxy causes smearing along the line of sight , known as _ the finger of god_. on larger scales , there is compression of structures along the line of sight due to coherent infall velocities of large - scale structure induced by gravity .",
    "one of the major difficulties in analysing redshift surveys is the transformation of the position of galaxies from redshift space to real space . for all sky surveys ,",
    "this issue can be addressed using several methods , for example the iterative method of yahil ( 1991 ) and modified poisson equation of nusser & davis 1994 .",
    "however , these methods are not applicable to surveys which are not all sky as they assume that in linear theory , the peculiar velocity of any galaxy is a result of the matter distribution around it , and the gravitational field is dominated by the matter distribution inside the volume of the survey . for a survey like 2dfgrs , within the limitation of linear theory where the redshift space density is a linear transformation of the real space density , a wiener filter can be used to transform from redshift space to real space ( see fisher ( 1995 ) and zaroubi ( 1995 ) for further details ) .",
    "this can be written as @xmath25 where the first term on the right hand side is the cross - correlation matrix of real and redshift space densities and * s*(*r * ) is the position vector in redshift space .",
    "it is worth emphasising that this method is limited as it only recovers the peculiar velocity field generated by the mass sources represented by the galaxies within the survey boundaries .",
    "it does not account for possible external forces .",
    "this limitation can only be overcome by comparing the 2df survey with all sky surveys .",
    "the 2dfgrs , now completed , is selected in the photometric @xmath26  band from the apm galaxy survey ( maddox , efstathiou & sutherland 1990 ) and its subsequent extensions ( maddox 2003 , in preparation ) .",
    "the survey covers about @xmath27 and is made up of two declination strips , one in the south galactic pole region ( sgp ) covering approximately @xmath28 , @xmath29 and the other in the direction of the north galactic pole ( ngp ) , spanning @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "in addition to these contiguous regions , there are a number of randomly located circular 2-degree fields scattered over the full extent of the low extinction regions of the southern apm galaxy survey .",
    "the magnitude limit at the start of the survey was set at @xmath32 but both the photometry of the input catalogue and the dust extinction map have been revised since and so there are small variations in magnitude limit as a function of position over the sky which are taken into account using the magnitude limit mask .",
    "the effective median magnitude limit , over the area of the survey , is @xmath33 ( colless 2001 ) .",
    "we use the data obtained prior to may 2002 , when the survey was nearly complete .",
    "this includes 221283 unique , reliable galaxy redshifts .",
    "we analyse a magnitude - limited sample with redshift limits @xmath34 and @xmath35 . the median redshift is @xmath36 .",
    "we use 167305 galaxies in total , 98129 in the sgp and 69176 in the ngp . we do not include the random fields in our analysis .",
    "the 2dfgrs database and full documentation are available on the www at http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/2dfgrs/.      the completeness of the survey varies according to the position in the sky due to unobserved fields , particularly at the survey edges , and unfibred objects in the observed fields because of collision constraints or broken fibres .    for our analysis , we make use of two different masks ( colless  2001 ; norberg  2002 ) .",
    "the first of these masks is the redshift completeness mask defined as the ratio of the number of galaxies for which redshifts have been measured to the total number of objects in the parent catalogue .",
    "this spatial incompleteness is illustrated in figure  [ mask ] .",
    "the second mask is the magnitude limit mask which gives the extinction corrected magnitude limit of the survey at each position .",
    "the radial selection function gives the probability of observing a galaxy for a given redshift and can be readily calculated from the galaxy luminosity function :    @xmath37    where for the concordance model : @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( norberg 2002 ) .",
    "the selection function can then be expressed as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the minimum luminosity detectable at luminosity distance @xmath43 ( assuming the concordance model ) , evaluated for the concordance model , @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the minimum luminosity for which the catalogue is complete and varies as a function of position over the sky . for distances considered in this paper , where the deviations from the hubble flow are relatively small , the selection function can be approximated as @xmath46 .",
    "each galaxy , @xmath47 , is then assigned the weight @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the values of the selection function for each galaxy and angular survey mask for each cell @xmath51 ( see section 4 ) , respectively .",
    "in order to form a data vector of overdensities , the survey needs to be pixelised .",
    "there are many ways to pixelise a survey : equal sized cubes in redshift space , igloo cells , spherical harmonics , delauney tessellation methods , wavelet decomposition , etc .",
    "each of these methods have their own advantages and disadvantages and they should be treated with care as they form functional bases in which all the statistical and physical properties of cosmic fields are retained .",
    "the pixelisation scheme used in this analysis is an ` igloo ' grid with wedge shaped pixels bounded in right ascension , declination and in redshift .",
    "the pixelisation is constructed to keep the average number density per pixel approximately constant .",
    "the advantage of using this pixelisation is that the number of pixels is minimised since the pixel volume is increased with redshift to counteract the decrease in the selection function .",
    "this is achieved by selecting a ` target cell width ' for cells at the mean redshift of the survey and deriving the rest of the bin widths so as to match the shape of the selection function .",
    "the target cell widths used in this analysis are @xmath2 mpc and @xmath1 mpc .",
    "once the redshift binning has been calculated each radial bin is split into declination bands and then each band in declination is further divided into cells in right ascension .",
    "the process is designed so as to make the cells roughly cubical . in figure  [ pixels ] , we show an illustration of this by plotting the cells in right ascension and declination for a given redshift strip .",
    "although advantageous in many ways , the pixelisation scheme used in this paper may complicate the interpretation of the reconstructed field . by definition",
    ", the wiener filter signal will approach to zero at the edges of the survey where the shot noise may dominate .",
    "this means the true signal will be constructed in a non - uniform manner .",
    "this effect will be amplified as the cell sizes get bigger at higher redshifts .",
    "hence , both of these effects must be considered when interpreting the results .",
    "the signal covariance matrix can be accurately modelled by an analytical approximation ( moody 2003 ) .",
    "the calculation of the covariance matrix is similar to the analysis described by efstathiou and moody ( 2001 ) apart from the modification due to three - dimensionality of the survey .",
    "the covariance matrix for the ` noise free ' density fluctuations is @xmath52 , where @xmath53 = @xmath54 in the @xmath51th pixel .",
    "it is estimated by first considering a pair of pixels with volumes @xmath55 and @xmath56 , separated by distance @xmath57 so that ,    c_ij & = & _ cell_i^ ( * x * ) dv_i _ cell_j^ ( * x+r * ) dv_j + & = & _ cell_i^_cell_j^ ( * x*)(*x+r * ) dv_idv_j + & = & _ cell_i^_cell_j^(*r * ) dv_idv_j where the isotropic two point correlation function @xmath58 is given by ( r ) & = & _ ^p(k)e^-i*kr*d^3k , and therefore , c_ij&= & _ p(k)d^3k + & & _ cell_i^_cell_j^ e^-i * k*(*r*_i-*r*_j ) dv_i dv_j .",
    "after performing the fourier transform , this equation can be written as c_ij & = & _ p(k)s(*k*,*l*_i)s(*k*,*l*_j ) c(*k*,*r*)d^3k , [ integrate ] where the functions @xmath59 and @xmath60 are given by , s(*k*,*l * ) & = & sinc(k_xl_x/2)sinc(k_yl_y/2 ) sinc(k_zl_z/2 ) + c(*k*,*r * ) & = & ( k_xr_x ) ( k_yr_y ) ( k_zr_z ) , where the label * l * describes the dimensions of the cell ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 ) , the components of * r * describes the separation between cell centres , * k*= ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) is the wavevector and @xmath67 .",

    "we define , k_x & = & k ( ) ( ) + k_y & = & k ( ) ( ) + k_z & = & k ( ) . .",

    "the cell window functions can be ignored , simplifying the calculation so that , g_ijk=_k_min^k_max(kr ) 4k^2dk , where @xmath43 is the separation between cell centres .",
    "in order to calculate the data vector @xmath75 in equation  [ swfvec ] , we first estimate the number of galaxies @xmath76 in each pixel @xmath51 : n_i=_gal^n_gal(i ) w(gal ) , where the sum is over all the observed galaxies in the pixel and @xmath77 is the weight assigned to each galaxy ( equation  [ weight ] ) .",
    "the boundaries of each pixel are defined by the scheme described in section 4 , using a target cell width of @xmath78 mpc .",

    "we note that the value for @xmath80 obtained using the equation above is consistent with the maximum estimator method proposed by davis and huchra ( 1982 ) . using these definitions",
    ", we write the @xmath51th component of the data vector @xmath75 as : d_i = .",
    "note that , the mean value of @xmath75 is zero by construction .",
    "reconstruction of the underlying signal given in equation  [ swfvec ] also requires the signal - signal and the inverse of the data - data correlation matrices .",
    "the data - data correlation matrix ( equation  [ ddcor ] ) is the sum of noise - noise correlation matrix @xmath81 and the signal - signal correlation matrix @xmath82 formulated in the previous section .",
    "the only change made is to the calculation of @xmath82 where the real space correlation function @xmath58 is now multiplied by kaiser s factor in order to correct for the redshift distortions on large scales .",

    "moreover , the conversion from @xmath100 to @xmath99 introduces uncertainties in the calculation .",
    "therefore , we choose an approximate value , @xmath101 to normalise the power spectrum . for @xmath102 , we adopt the value found by hawkins ( 2002 ) , @xmath103 which is estimated at the effective luminosity , @xmath104 , and the effective redshift , @xmath105 , of the survey sample .",

    "however , since the pixelisation was constructed to keep the shot noise per pixel approximately constant , @xmath119 also stays constant ( @xmath120 for both ngp and sgp ) but the average density contrast in each pixel decreases with increasing redshift .",

    "this increase is clearly evident in figures  [ 1res ] and  [ 2res ] .",
    "another conclusion that can be drawn from the figures is that the bumps in the density field are due to real features not due to error in the reconstruction , even at higher redshifts .",
    "@xmath122    @xmath123      in order to increase the resolution of the density field maps , we reduce the target cell width to @xmath124 mpc .",

    "the variance of the mass density field in this sphere is @xmath126 which corresponds to non - linear scales . to reconstruct the density field on these scales ,",
    "we require accurate descriptions of non - linear galaxy power spectrum and the non - linear redshift space distortions .    for the non - linear matter power spectrum @xmath127",
    ", we adopt the empirical fitting formula of smith ( 2003 ) .",
    "this formula , derived using the ` halo model ' for galaxy clustering , is more accurate than the widely used peacock & dodds ( 1996 ) fitting formula which is based on the assumption of ` stable clustering ' of virialized halos .",
    "we note that for the scales concerned in this paper ( up to @xmath128 ) , smith ( 2003 ) and peacock & dodds ( 1996 ) fitting formulae give very similar results .",
    "for simplicity we assume linear , scale independent biasing in order to determine the galaxy power spectrum from the mass power spectrum , where @xmath3 measures the ratio between galaxy and mass distribution , p_nl^r = b^2p_nl^m , [ bias ] where @xmath129 is the galaxy and @xmath130 is the matter power spectrum .",
    "we assume that @xmath131 for our analysis . while this value is in agreement with the result obtained from 2dfgrs ( lahav 2002 , verde 2002 ) for scales of tens of mpc , it does not hold true for the scales of @xmath124 mpc on which different galaxy populations show different clustering patterns ( norberg 2002 , madgwick 2002 , zehavi 2002 ) .",
    "more realistic models exist where biasing is scale dependent ( e.g. seljak , 2000 and peacock & smith , 2000 ) but since the wiener filtering method is not sensitive to small errors in the prior parameters and the reconstruction scales are not highly non - linear , the simple assumption of no bias will still give accurate reconstructions .",
    "the main effect of redshift distortions on non - linear scales is the reduction of power as a result of radial smearing due to virialized motions .",
    "the density profile in redshift space is then the convolution of its real space counterpart with the peculiar velocity distribution along the line of sight , leading to damping of power on small scales .",
    "this effect is known to be reasonably well approximated by treating the pairwise peculiar velocity field as gaussian or better still as an exponential in real space ( superpositions of gaussians ) , with dispersion @xmath132 ( e.g. peacock & dodds 1994 , ballinger 1996 & kang 2002 ) . therefore the galaxy power spectrum in redshift space is written as p_nl^s(k,)= p_nl^r(k,)(1+^2)^2d(k_p ) , [ nlps ] where @xmath133 is the cosine of the wave vector to the line of sight , @xmath132 has the unit of @xmath134 mpc and the damping function in @xmath135-space is a loretzian : d(k_p)=. integrating equation  [ nlps ] over @xmath133 , we obtain the direction - averaged power spectrum in redshift space : & = & + + & + & .",
    "[ nlpz ] for the non - linear reconstruction , we use equation  [ nlpz ] instead of equation  [ linpz ] when deriving the correlation function in redshift space .",
    "figure  [ pk ] shows how the non - linear power spectrum is damped in redshift space ( dashed line ) and compared to the linear power spectrum ( dotted line ) . in this plot and throughout this paper we adopt the @xmath132 value derived by hawkins ( 2002 ) , @xmath136 .",
    "interestingly , by coincidence , the non - linear and linear power spectra look very similar in redshift space .",
    "so , if we had used the linear power spectrum instead of its non - linear counterpart , we still would have obtained physically accurate reconstructions of the density field in redshift space .",
    "the optimal density field in real space is calculated using equation  [ opt ] .",
    "the cross - correlation matrix in equation  [ appopt ] can now be approximated as @xmath137 again , integrating the equation above over @xmath133 , the direction averaged cross - correlation matrix of the density field in real space and the density field in redshift space can be written as & = & ( k^2_p^2(1 + ) ) + & + & + ( k^2_p^2 ) .    at the end of this paper , we show some examples of the non - linear reconstructions ( figures  [ 00sgp ] ,  [ 5mpc10sgp ] , [ 5mpc2ngp ] and  [ 5mpc6ngp ] ) . as can be seen from these plots the resolution of the reconstructions improves radically , down to the scale of large clusters .",
    "comparing figure  [ 14ngp ] and figure  [ 5mpc6ngp ] where the redshift ranges of the maps are similar , we conclude that 10 @xmath134 mpc and 5 @xmath134 mpc resolutions give consistent reconstructions .",
    "due to the very large number of cells , we reconstruct four separate density fields for redshift ranges @xmath138z@xmath139 and @xmath140z@xmath141 in sgp , @xmath138z@xmath139 and @xmath140z@xmath142 in ngp .",
    "there are 46 redshift slices in total .",
    "the number of cells for the latter reconstructions are in the order of 10 000 .",
    "to investigate the effects of using different non - linear redshift distortion approximations , we also reconstruct one field without the damping function but just collapsing the fingers of god .",
    "although including the damping function results in a more physically accurate reconstruction of the density field in real space , it still is not enough to account for the elongation of the richest clusters along the line of sight . collapsing the fingers of god as well as including the damping function underestimates power resulting in noisy reconstruction of the density field .",
    "we choose to use only the damping function for the non - linear scales obtaining stable results for the density field reconstruction .    the theory of gravitational instability states that as the dynamics evolve away from the linear regime , the initial field deviates from gaussianity and skewness develops .",
    "the wiener filter , in the form presented here , only minimises the variance and it ignores the higher moments that describe the skewness of the underlying distribution .",
    "however , since the scales of reconstructions presented in this section are not highly non - linear and the signal - to - noise ratio is high , the assumptions involved in this analysis are not severely violated for the non - linear reconstruction of the density field in redshift space .",
    "the real space reconstructions are more sensitive to the choice of cell size and the power spectrum since the wiener filter is used not only for noise suppression but also for transformation from redshift space .",
    "therefore , reconstructions in redshift space are more reliable on these non - linear scales than those in real space .",
    "a different approach to the non - linear density field reconstruction presented in this paper is to apply the wiener filter to the reconstruction of the logarithm of the density field as there is good evidence that the statistical properties of the perturbation field in the quasi - linear regime is well approximated by a log - normal distribution .",
    "a detailed analysis of the application of the wiener filtering technique to log - normal fields is given in sheth ( 1995 ) .",
    "one of the main goals of this paper is to use the reconstructed density field to identify the major superclusters and voids in the 2dfgrs .",
    "we define superclusters ( voids ) as regions of large overdensity ( underdensity ) which is above ( below ) a certain threshold .",
    "this approach has been used successfully by several authors ( e.g. einasto 2002 & 2003 , kolokotronis , basilakos & plionis 2002 , plionis & basilakos 2002 , saunders 1991 ) .      in order to find the superclusters listed in table  [ tab : sc ] , we define the density contrast threshold , @xmath143 , as distance dependent .",
    "we use a varying density threshold for two reasons that are related to the way the density field is reconstructed .",
    "firstly , the adaptive gridding we use implies that the cells get bigger with increasing redshift .",
    "this means that the density contrast in each cell decreases .",
    "the second effect that decreases the density contrast arises due to the wiener filter signal tending to zero towards the edges of the survey .",
    "therefore , for each redshift slice we find the mean and the standard deviation of the density field ( averaged over 113 cells for ngp and 223 for sgp ) , then we calculate @xmath143 as twice the standard deviation of the field added to its mean , averaged over sgp and ngp for each redshift bin ( see figure  [ thresh ] ) . in order to account for the clustering effects ,",
    "we fit a smooth curve to @xmath143 , using @xmath144 minimisation .",
    "the best fit , also shown figure  [ thresh ] , is a quadratic equation with @xmath144/(number of degrees of freedom ) = 1.6 .",
    "we use this fit when selecting the overdensities .",
    "we note that choosing smoothed or unsmoothed density threshold does not change the selection of the superclusters .",
    "the list of superclusters in sgp and ngp region are given in table  [ tab : sc ] .",
    "this table is structured as follows : column 1 is the identification , columns 2 and 3 are the minimum and the maximum redshift , columns 4 and 5 are the minimum and maximum @xmath109 , columns 6 and 7 are the minimum and maximum @xmath110 over which the density contours above @xmath143 extend . in column 8 , we show the number of durham groups with more than 5 members that the supercluster contains . in column 9",
    ", we show the number of abell , apm and edcc clusters studied by de propris ( 2002 ) the supercluster has . in the last column",
    ", we show the total number of groups and clusters .",
    "note that most of the abell clusters are counted in the durham group catalogue .",
    "we observe that the rich groups ( groups with more than 9 members ) almost always reside in superclusters whereas poorer groups are more dispersed .",
    "we note that the superclusters that contain abell clusters are on average richer than superclusters that do not contain abell clusters , in agreement with einasto 2003 .",
    "however , we also note that the number of abell clusters in a rich supercluster can be equal to the number of abell clusters in a poorer supercluster , whereas the number of durham groups increase as the overdensity increases .",
    "thus , we conclude that the durham groups are in general better representatives of the underlying density distribution of 2dfgrs than abell clusters .",
    "the superclusters scsgp03 , scsgp04 and scsgp05 can be seen in figure  [ 02sgp ] .",
    "scsgp04 is part the rich pisces - cetus supercluster which was first described by tully ( 1987 ) .",
    "scsgp01 , scsgp02 , scsgp03 and scsgp04 are all filamentary structures connected to each other , forming a multi branching system .",
    "scsgp05 seems to be a more isolated system , possibly connected to scsgp06 and scsgp07 .",
    "scsgp06 ( figure  [ 06sgp ] ) is the upper part of the gigantic horoglium reticulum supercluster .",
    "scsgp07 ( figure  [ 06sgp ] ) is the extended part of the leo - coma supercluster .",
    "the richest supercluster in the sgp region is scsgp16 which can be seen in the middle of the plots in figure  [ 5mpc10sgp ] .",
    "also shown , in the same figure , is scsgp15 , one of the richest superclusters in sgp and the edge of scsgp17 .",
    "in fact , as evident from figure  [ 5mpc10sgp ] , scsgp14 , scsgp15 , scsgp16 and scsgp17 are branches of one big filamentary structure . in figure",
    "[ 5mpc2ngp ] , we see scngp01 , this structure is part of the upper edge of the shapley supercluster .",
    "the richest supercluster in ngp is scngp06 , shown in figure  [ 09ngp ] . around this , in the neighbouring redshift slices , there are two rich filamentary superclusters , scngp06 , scngp08 ( figure  [ 14ngp ] ) .",
    "scngp07 seems to be the node point of these filamentary structures .",
    "table 1 shows only the major overdensities in the survey .",
    "these tend to be filamentary structures that are mostly connected to each other .      for the catalogue of the largest voids in table  [ tab : sgpvoid ] and table  [ tab : ngpvoid ] , we only consider regions with 80 percent completeness or more and go up to a redshift of 0.15 .",
    "following the previous studies ( e.g. el - ad & piran 2000 , benson 2003 & sheth 2003 ) , our chosen underdensity threshold is @xmath145 .",
    "the lists of galaxies and their properties that are in these voids and in the other smaller voids that are not in tables  [ tab : sgpvoid ] and  [ tab : ngpvoid ] are given in url : http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/@xmath111pirin .",
    "the tables of voids is structured in a similar way as the table of superclusters , only we give separate tables for ngp and sgp voids .",
    "the most intriguing structures seen are the voids vsgp01 , vsgp2 , vsgp03 , vsgp4 and vsgp05 .",
    "these voids , clearly visible in the radial number density function of 2dfgrs , are actually part of a big superhole broken up by the low value of the void density threshold .",
    "this superhole has been observed and investigated by several authors ( e.g. cross 2002 , de propis 2002 , norberg 2002 , frith 2003 ) .",
    "the local ngp region also has excess underdensity ( vngp01,vngp02 , vngp03 , vngp04 , vngp05 , vngp06 and vngp07 , again part of a big superhole ) but the voids in this area are not as big or as empty as the voids in local sgp .",
    "in fact , by combining the results from 2 micron all sky survey , las campanas survey and 2dfgrs , frith ( 2003 ) conclude that these underdensities suggest that there is a contiguous void stretching from north to south .",
    "if such a void does exist then it is unexpectedly large for our present understanding of large scale structure , where on large enough scales the universe is isotropic and homogeneous .",
    "in this paper we use the wiener filtering technique to reconstruct the density field of the 2df galaxy redshift survey .",
    "we pixelise the survey into igloo cells bounded by @xmath109 , @xmath110 and redshift .",
    "the cell size varies in order to keep the number of galaxies per cell roughly constant and is approximately 10 @xmath134 for mpc high and 5 @xmath134 mpc for the low resolution maps at the median redshift of the survey . assuming a prior based on parameters @xmath146 , @xmath7 , @xmath147 , @xmath148 and @xmath149 , we find that the reconstructed density field clearly picks out the groups catalogue built by eke ( 2003 ) and abell , apm and edcc clusters investigated by de propris ( 2002 ) .",
    "we also reconstruct four separate density fields with different redshift ranges for a smaller cell size of 5 @xmath134 mpc at the median redshift . for these reconstructions , we assume a non - linear power spectrum fit developed by smith ( 2003 ) and linear biasing . the resolution of the density field improves dramatically , down to the size of big clusters .",
    "the derived high resolution density fields is in agreement with the lower resolution versions .",
    "we use the reconstructed fields to identify the major superclusters and voids in sgp and ngp .",
    "we find that the richest superclusters are filamentary and multi branching , in agreement with einasto 2002 .",
    "we also find that the rich clusters always reside in superclusters whereas poor clusters are more dispersed .",
    "we present the major superclusters in 2dfgrs in table 1 .",
    "we pick out two very rich superclusters , one in sgp and one in ngp .",
    "we also identify voids as underdensities that are below @xmath150 and that lie in regions with more that 80@xmath151 completeness .",
    "these underdensities are presented in table 2 ( sgp ) and table 3 ( ngp ) .",
    "we pick out two big voids , one in sgp and one in ngp . unfortunately",
    ", we can not measure the sizes and masses of the large structures we observe in 2df as most of these structures continue beyond the boundaries of the survey .",
    "the detailed maps and lists of all of the reconstructed density fields , plots of the residual fields and the lists of the galaxies that are in underdense regions can be found on www at http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/@xmath111pirin .",
    "one of the main aims of this paper is to identify the large scale structure in 2dfgrs .",
    "the wiener filtering technique provides a rigorous methodology for variable smoothing and noise suppression . as such , a natural continuation of this work is using the wiener filtering method in conjunction with other methods to further investigate the geometry and the topology of the supercluster - void network .",
    "sheth ( 2003 ) developed a powerful surface modelling scheme , surfgen , in order to calculate the minkowski functionals of the surface generated from the density field .",
    "the four minkowski functionals  the area , the volume , the extrinsic curvature and the genus  contain information about the geometry , connectivity and topology of the surface ( cf .",
    "mecke , buchert & wagner 1994 and sheth 2003 ) and thus they will provide a detailed morphological analysis of the superclusters and voids in 2dfgrs .",
    "although not applicable to 2dfgrs , the wiener reconstruction technique is well suited to recovering the velocity fields from peculiar velocity catalogues .",
    "comparisons of galaxy density and velocity fields allow direct estimations of the cosmological parameters such as the bias parameter and the mean mass density .",
    "these comparisons will be possible with the upcoming 6df galaxy survey ( http://www .. mso.anu.edu.au/6dfgs ) which will measure the redshifts of 170,000 galaxies and the peculiar velocities of 15,000 galaxies by june 2005 .",
    "compared to 2dfgrs , the 6df survey has a much higher sky - coverage ( the entire southern sky down to @xmath152 ) .",
    "this wide survey area would allow a full hemispheric wiener reconstruction of large scale structure so that the sizes and masses of the superclusters and voids can be determined .",
    "the 2df galaxy redshift survey was made possible through the dedicated efforts of the staff at anglo - australian observatory , both in crediting the two - degree field instrument and supporting it on the telescope .",
