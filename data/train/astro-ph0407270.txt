    "ch@xmath1 was detected only in the solid state in low resolution _ infrared space observatory ( iso ) _ observations at 7.67 @xmath5  toward @xmath11 low mass protostars @xcite , the galactic center @xcite , and an external galactic nucleus @xcite . a recent low resolution _",

    "observations of ch@xmath1 provide insight into the basic principles of astrochemical networks . in the presence of atomic c and h , ch@xmath1 is rapidly formed on cold grains , just as h@xmath12o is formed from atomic o and h ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , the observed gas and solid state ch@xmath1 abundances are low , not more than a few percent with respect to co and h@xmath12o @xcite .",
    "this points to relatively low atomic c abundances at the time of ch@xmath1 formation , when most c is already locked up in co. in this same scenario the high ch@xmath13oh abundances in several lines of sight may be explained by hydrogenation of abundantly present co @xcite , and large co@xmath12 abundances by oxidation of co. the dominance of a co- and o - based , rather than c - based , chemistry is stressed by the profiles of solid co@xmath12 absorption bands which show an intimate mixture of co@xmath12 , ch@xmath13oh , and h@xmath12o in the ices @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , even at relatively low abundances methane is proposed to be the starting point of a rich chemistry leading to the complex organic molecules observed in dense clouds like the tmc-1 ridge @xcite . to further test the role of ch@xmath1 in interstellar chemistry , basic diagnostics , such as gas phase abundances , gas / solid phase abundance ratios , gas phase temperatures and abundance gradients need to be measured in more lines of sight .    in this work",

    "here we independently confirm the presence of ch@xmath1 by detecting many lines from the 3.32 @xmath5  stretching mode as well as the ice band .",
    "the high spectral resolution of these observations permits a line profile analysis in which we determine gas phase conditions in the various environments along the line sight , such as the envelope , the hot core , and the outflow .",

    "<S> absorption and emission lines originating from the @xmath0 c - h stretching manifold of gas phase ch@xmath1 were discovered in the high resolution ( @xmath2=25,000 ) infrared l band spectrum along the line of sight toward ngc 7538 : irs9 . </S>",
    "<S> these observations provide a diagnostic of the complex dynamics and chemistry in a massive star forming region . </S>",
    "<S> the line shapes resemble p cygni profiles with the absorption and emission components shifted by @xmath3 @xmath4  with respect to the systemic velocity . </S>",
    "<S> similar velocity components were observed in co at 4.7 @xmath5 , but in contrast to ch@xmath1 , the co shows deep absorption due to a high velocity outflow as well as absorption at the systemic velocity due to the cold outer envelope . </S>",
    "<S> it is concluded that the gas phase ch@xmath1 abundance varies by an order of magnitude in this line of sight : it is low in the envelope and the outflow ( x[ch@xmath1]@xmath7 ) , and at least a factor of 10 larger in the central core . </S>",
    "<S> the discovery of solid ch@xmath1 in independent ground and space based data sets shows that methane is nearly entirely frozen onto grains in the envelope . </S>",
    "<S> it thus appears that ch@xmath1 is formed by grain surface reactions , evaporates into the gas phase in the warm inner regions of protostellar cores and is efficiently destroyed in shocks related to outflows . </S>"
