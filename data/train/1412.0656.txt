    "models of inflation that rely on the slow rolling of a single scalar field have become the canonical family of models for inflation @xcite .",
    "these models are specified by a potential - energy density @xmath6 given as a function of the inflaton field @xmath7 . as long as the slow - roll conditions , which require that the slope and curvature of @xmath6 are sufficiently small , are satisfied , the universe inflates",
    "inflation then ends and is followed by a period of reheating ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) that converts the energy density in the inflaton to the thermal bath , at a reheating temperature @xmath4 , that fills the universe at the beginning of the standard radiation - dominated epoch .    in the canonical reheating scenario @xcite ,",
    "oscillations of the inflaton around the minimum of its potential correspond to massive inflaton particles , and these particles then decay to the plasma of standard model particles that compose the radiation - dominated universe .",
    "however , the physics of reheating may be far more complicated .",
    "for example , different rates for different types of decays into different standard model particles may yield different clocks for starting the usual radiation - dominated epoch",
    ". there may be a preheating stage @xcite , where there is a resonant production of particles @xcite , which can enhance the inflaton decay via scattering @xcite , or where inhomogeneous modes may be excited @xcite .",
    "turbulence may also play a role @xcite .",
    "it is generally assumed that the reheat temperature is above the electroweak transition ( presumably so that weak - scale dark matter can be produced ) .",
    "more conservatively , though , the reheat temperature must be above an mev , the temperature of big - bang nucleosynthesis , the earliest time for which we have clear empirical relics . the theoretical uncertainty in reheating is often taken into account , in the consideration of experimental constraints to inflation models , by surmising some reasonable range  e.g .",
    ", @xmath0 to @xmath1for the number @xmath8 of @xmath2-folds of inflation between the time that our observable horizon exited the horizon during inflation and the end of inflation .",
    "the upper limit to this range arises if inflaton oscillations reheat the universe instantaneously to a grand unified theory - scale temperature , and the lower limit arises if reheating is closer to the electroweak scale .    here we consider an alternative approach where we parametrize the cosmic fluid during reheating by an effective equation - of - state parameter @xmath3 , that tells us how its energy density ( @xmath9 ) decays during this epoch . in the canonical - reheating scenario @xmath10 , but numerical studies of thermalization",
    "indicate a possibly broader range of values @xmath11 @xcite . by demanding that the equation - of - state parameter fall within this range , we infer slightly better constraints to inflation models than in the usual approach wherein some overly permissive range of @xmath8 is assumed .",
    "the approach we use here was discussed in refs .",

    "we show in particular that the lower limit to the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath5 inferred from current measurements of @xmath12 should be a bit higher ( by about @xmath13 ) if we restrict the value of @xmath3 to the range suggested by reheating theory .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section",

    "it then decreases for @xmath22 @xmath2-folds of expansion during which the energy in the inflaton potential is dissipated into a radiation bath .",
    "the standard radiation - dominated era then proceeds for @xmath23 @xmath2-folds before the advent of matter domination ( and then dark - energy domination ) .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the number of @xmath2-folds of expansion between the time that a given scale exits the horizon and the end of inflation is related to the number of @xmath2-folds since the end of inflation until that scale re - enters the horizon during matter / radiation - domination .",
    "the expansion history also determines the evolution of the energy density , and a second relation can be obtained from a given expansion history by demanding the proper relation between the energy density during inflation and the energy density today .    a consistent model for inflation must have an inflaton potential @xmath6 that at some point steepens so that the slow - roll condition @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 is the slow - roll parameter and @xmath26 is the reduced planck mass ) breaks down , at which point inflation ends .",

    "the hubble parameter can then be written in terms of the inflaton potential using the friedmann equation , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is evaluated through the slow - roll equation , @xmath33 , where the prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath7 .",

    "it is also important to note that the tightness of the constraint to the @xmath12 parameter space for fixed @xmath70 ( for natural inflation ) or @xmath99 ( for higgs - like inflation ) is determined not by the precision of current measurements , but by the self consistency of the inflationary - plus - reheating model . for",

    "would only shift the black curves to the right .",
    "we have explored a new technique to find constraints to inflationary models by studying their reheating period . instead of focusing on the physics of the reheating phase itself , or assuming an overly ample parameter space by constraining the number of @xmath2-folds of inflation , we characterize the whole reheating era by a single equation - of - state parameter @xmath3 , that we constrain to have physically reasonable values .",
    "this leads to more precise constraints to the inflationary observables .",
    "we have applied this formalism to two families of potentials ( natural inflation and higgs - like inflation ) , finding better lower bounds for the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath5 , as can be seen in table [ tab ] ( where the usual @xmath71 , @xmath94 potentials are in bold face ) .",
    "it is important to notice that these results are robust to changes in the equation - of - state parameter as long as it is kept under @xmath1151/3 , as suggested by the literature on reheating .",
    "the results derived for the potentials studied also apply , taking the limiting cases @xmath70 or @xmath116 , to power - law models and , as we show in figure [ fig : rns ] , the allowed region for the power - law case ( green line ) is more constrained using our method than with the usual analysis in which the range for the numbers of @xmath2-folds is fixed . for comparison ,",
    "the right - hand plots in figures [ fig : natural ] and [ fig : higgs ] correspond to the plot made on @xcite for @xmath112 potential , showing in the upper panel @xmath8 instead of @xmath22 .",
    ".minimum value of the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath5 at the pivot scale @xmath108 mpc@xmath109 allowed by reheating considerations and the planck @xmath114 range of values of the scalar spectral index @xmath12 for each of the models studied . in the central column",

    "it was considered for power - law potentials in refs .",
    "@xcite , and we have generalized here to natural and higgs - like potentials .",
    "still , the approach can be similarly applied to any single - field inflation model and will generically lead to slightly more restrictive bounds to the inflationary parameter space , including the range of values of the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath5 . as a result ,",
