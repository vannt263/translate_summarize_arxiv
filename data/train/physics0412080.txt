    "among the many ideas developed around the use of liquid noble gases , the liquid argon time projection chamber  @xcite certainly represented one of the most challenging and appealing designs .",
    "the technology was proposed as a tool for uniform and high accuracy imaging of massive detector volumes .",
    "the operating principle of the lar tpc was based on the fact that in highly purified lar ionization tracks could indeed be transported undistorted by a uniform electric field over distances of the order of meters .",
    "imaging is provided by wire planes placed at the end of the drift path , continuously sensing and recording the signals induced by the drifting electrons .",
    "liquid argon is an ideal medium since it provides high density , excellent properties ( ionization , scintillation yields ) and is intrinsically safe and cheap , and readily available anywhere as a standard by - product of the liquefaction of air .",
    "non  destructive readout of ionization electrons by charge induction allows to detect the signal of electrons crossing subsequent planes with different wire orientation .",
    "this provides several projective views of the same event , hence allowing for space point reconstruction and precise calorimetric measurement .",
    "the feasibility of this technology has been demonstrated by the extensive icarus r&d program , which included studies on small lar volumes about proof of principle , lar purification methods , readout schemes and electronics , as well as studies with several prototypes of increasing mass on purification technology , collection of physics events , pattern recognition , long duration tests and readout .",
    "the largest of these prototypes had a mass of 3 tons of lar  @xcite and has been continuously operated for more than four years , collecting a large sample of cosmic - ray and gamma - source events .",
    "furthermore , a smaller device with 50 l of lar  @xcite was exposed to the cern neutrino beam , demonstrating the high recognition capability of the technique for neutrino interaction events .",
    "the realization of the 600 ton icarus detector culminated with its full test carried out at surface during the summer 2001  @xcite .",
    "this test demonstrated that the lar tpc technique can be operated at the kton scale with a drift length of 1.5  m.",
    "the bubble - chamber - like reconstruction capability of the liquid argon tpc provides simultaneously ( 1 ) a tracking device with unbiased imaging and reconstruction , and ( 2 ) full sampling calorimetry .",
    "the detector is fully active , homogeneous and isotropic .",
    "the resolution is very good , both for energy ( calorimetry ) and for angular reconstruction ( tracking ) .",
    "the possibility to complement the features with those provided by a magnetic field has been considered and would open new possibilities @xcite : ( a ) charge discrimination , ( b ) momentum measurement of particles escaping the detector ( @xmath0 high energy muons ) , ( c ) very precise kinematics , since the measurements are multiple scattering dominated ( e.g. @xmath1 for a track length of @xmath2 and a field of @xmath3 ) .",
    "the orientation of the magnetic field can be chosen such that the bending direction is in the direction of the drift where the best spatial resolution is achieved .",
    "the magnetic field is hence perpendicular to the electric drift field .",
    "the lorentz angle is expected to be very small in liquid ( e.g. @xmath4 at @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) . embedding the volume of argon into a magnetic field",
    "should therefore not alter the imaging properties of the detector and the measurement of the bending of charged hadrons or penetrating muons would allow a precise determination of the momentum and a determination of their charge .",
    "the required magnetic field for charge discrimination for a path @xmath7 in liquid argon @xcite is given by the bending    @xmath8    and the multiple scattering contribution :    @xmath9    at low momenta , we can safely neglect the contribution from the position measurement error given the readout pitch and drift time resolution .",
    "the momentum determination resolution is then given by : @xmath10 and the statistical significance for charge separation can be written as ( @xmath11 are the bending for positive and negative charges ) : @xmath12 for example , with a field of 0.55  t , the charge of tracks of 10  cm can be separated at @xmath13 .",
    "the requirement for a @xmath14 charge discrimination can be written as : @xmath15 , which implies a field strength :    @xmath16    for long penetrating tracks like muons , a field of @xmath17 allows to discriminate the charge for tracks longer than 4 meters .",
    "this corresponds for example to a muon momentum threshold of 800  mev / c .",
    "hence , performances are very good , even at very low momenta . unlike muons or hadrons ,",
    "the early showering of electrons makes their charge identification difficult .",
    "the track length usable for charge discrimination is limited to a few radiation lengths after which the showers make the recognition of the parent electron more difficult . in practice ,",
    "charge discrimination is possible for high fields @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 . from simulations",
    ", we found that the determination of the charge of electrons of energy in the range between 1 and 5 gev is feasible with good purity , provided the field has a strength in the range of 1  t. preliminary estimates show that these electrons exhibit an average curvature sufficient to have electron charge discrimination better than @xmath21 with an efficiency of 20%@xcite .",
    "further studies are on - going .",
    "an r&d programme to investigate a lar tpc in a magnetic field was initiated .",
    "the goal was to study the drift properties of free electrons in lar in the presence of a magnetic field and to prove that the imaging capabilities are not affected .",
    "the test programme included ( 1 ) checking the basic imaging in b - field ( 2 ) measuring traversing and stopping muons ( 3 ) test charge discrimination ( 4 ) check lorentz angle .",
    "we report here on preliminary results obtained .",
    "a complete report is in preparation  @xcite .",
    "the experimental setup ( see figure  [ fig : setup ] ) was custom built for this test .    we have first designed and assembled a liquid argon tpc with a width of 300  mm , a height of 150  mm and a maximal drift length of 150  mm",
    "( see figure  [ fig : laff1 ] ) .",
    "its dimensions were chosen to fit in the recycled sindrum i magnet , which allows to test the chamber in a maximal field of 0.55  t. at the maximal field the dc current is 850  a corresponding to a power consumption of 220  kw . the electrical power and the water cooling circuit necessary to operate the magnet in the laboratory had to be specially installed by eth .",
    "the cryostat is made of three concentrical cylinders : the inner most with a diameter of 250  mm contains the purified lar with the drift chamber , the second cylinder is a ln@xmath22 bath kept under an absolute pressure of 2.7  bar in order not to freeze out the lar at about 1  bar , it is wrapped with 25 layers of superinsulation ; the outer most cylinder is for the insulation vacuum .",
    "the drift chamber consists of a rectangular cathode , 27 field shaping electrodes spaced by 5  mm and the three detector planes .",
    "the first two detector planes are wire chambers with the wires oriented at @xmath23 to the vertical ; the stainless steel wires have a diameter of @xmath24 and a pitch of 2  mm .",
    "the wire chambers are operated at potentials such that they are transparent to the drifting electrons and only pick up an induced signal from the electron cloud passing the planes .",
    "the third plane is a pcb with horizontal strips with a width of 1  mm and a pitch of 2  mm on which the drift electrons are collected .",
    "the wires and the strips are connected through 3  m long twisted pair cables to the feedthroughs on a flange , from the feedthroughs the signals are connected through 20  cm cables to the analog boards ( caen - v791 ) of the icarus readout electronics ; the vme - like analog board contains the low - noise preamplifiers for 32 channels and two multiplexed 10 bit fadc running at 40  mhz ; each wire ( strip ) is sampled with 2.5  mhz .",
    "the readout electronics works as a continuous wave form digitizer : the digitized data are stored in a buffer , large enough to contain the data of a time interval of about 1  ms for each channel ; the maximal drift time during this run was about 150  @xmath25s .",
    "when a trigger occurs the filling of the buffer is stopped and the data are transferred to a pci card in a pc , the pci card is read out with a labview program . the high voltage up to a maximal value of 22.5  kv is applied to the cathode and is connected through a resistor chain to the field shaping elctrodes in order to produce a homogeneous electric drift field ( horizontal and perpendicular to the solenoid axis ) .",
    "there were two different triggers used : to trigger on cosmic ray muons passing through the magnet , plastic scintillators mounted on top and at the bottom of the magnet were used .",
    "the trigger counters also define the time @xmath26 of the event , needed to determine the drift time from the chamber signals .",
    "the sum - output from the chamber signals allows to trigger on low - energy events , as e.g. muons stopping in the chamber . in this case the scintillators on the top of the chamber are use to define the @xmath26 .",
    "in november 2004 the setup was ready for a first test . before filling with lar ,",
    "the cylinder containing the drift chamber was pumped during four weeks ; the final vacuum was better than @xmath27  mbar .",
    "after cooling down during a few days with ln@xmath22 , the cylinder was filled through a purification cartridge with lar ; the same lar filling was used during the whole three weeks of data taking without recirculating it through the purification cartridge . starting the tests without magnetic field and triggering with the scintillator counters , clean cosmic ray tracks",
    "were immediately observed at a drift field of 500  v / cm .",
    "about 100 passing - through muons per hour were stored . from the observation of a decreasing collected drift charge with increasing drift time ,",
    "the mean lifetime of the free electrons in lar was estimated to be about 100  @xmath25s ; it did not decrease significantly during the whole period of the run .",
    "+ after a few days of commissioning , the magnetic field was turned on to the maximal value of 0.55  t. the signal - to - noise ratio of the chamber signals did not change significantly with the magnet on .",
    "figure  [ fig : eve ] shows the raw data ( from the collection plane ) of events with the magnetic field turned on and with a drift field of 300  v / cm ; the intensity of the black color is a measure of the collected charge .",
    "the horizontal axis corresponds to the drift time and the vertical axis to the wire number .",
    "the figures show the two - dimensional projection of tracks in the plane perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "combining clusters with equal drift time from two ( or three ) planes allows the three - dimensional reconstruction of the track@xcite .",
    "these events are interpreted as cosmic muons either crossing or stopping then decaying in the detector .",
    "delta - rays or converted @xmath28-pairs are also easily identifiable .",
    "we have built a small lar test tpc and operated it for the first time in a magnetic field ( 0.55  t ) perpendicular to the electric drift field .",
    "the quality of cosmic ray tracks is not significantly decreased with the b - field turned on . the setup will be used to study the drift properties of electrons in lar in a magnetic field and a measurement of the lorentz angle is foreseen .",
    "a complete description of this work is in preparation@xcite .",
