    "extra dimensional theories where standard model fields are localized on a brane @xcite have recently attracted a lot of attention , since such models have several distinct features from ordinary kaluza - klein ( kk ) theories . in particular ,",
    "randall and sundrum @xcite presented a simple model based on two branes and a single extra dimension , where the hierarchy problem could be solved due to the exponentially changing metric along the extra dimension . in order to obtain a phenomenologically acceptable model , the radion field ( which corresponds to fluctuations in the distance of the two branes ) has to get a mass",
    ", otherwise it would violate the equivalence principle @xcite , and also result in unconventional cosmological expansion equations @xcite .",
    "the simplest mechanism for radius stabilization has been suggested by goldberger and wise @xcite , who employed an additional bulk scalar which has a bulk mass term and also couples to both branes ( for another issues related to the radion potential see @xcite ) .",
    "both the cosmology and collider phenomenology crucially depend on the mass and couplings of the radion . in particular",
    ", there is no radion moduli problem if the radion mass is @xmath6 and its couplings to standard model ( sm ) fields is @xmath7 .",
    "this is also the most favorable scenario for discovering the radion at a future collider .",
    "in fact it was shown in @xcite , that the radion will have the above properties for the goldberger  wise scenario .",
    "however , the calculation of @xcite were using a nave ansatz for the radion field which ignores both the radion wavefunction and the backreaction of the stabilizing scalar field on the metric .",
    "the validity of this approximation has recently been questioned @xcite .",
    "therefore in this paper we analyze the coupled radion - scalar system in detail from the 5d point of view .",
    "we derive the coupled differential equations governing the dynamics of the system , and find the mass eigenvalues for some limiting cases . due to the coupling between the radion and the bulk scalar , we find that there will be a single kk tower describing the system , with the metric perturbations non - vanishing for every kk mode .",
    "this implies that the standard model fields localized on the tev brane will couple to every kk mode from the bulk scalar , and this could provide a means to directly probe the stabilizing physics .    using the coupled equations for the radion ",
    "scalar system , we analyze the late  time behavior of the radion in an expanding universe , and find that the troubling 55component of einstein s equation just determines the shift of the radion .",
    "this shift completely agrees with the shift obtained in @xcite using the 4d effective theory .",
    "given that we have established that the radion mass is @xmath6 and that its couplings to sm particles is @xmath7 , it is reasonable to consider its effects on sm phenomenology .",
    "some direct collider signatures for the radion and loop corrections have been discussed in @xcite . in the second half of this paper",
    "the effects of the radion on the oblique parameters are calculated using an effective theory approach similar to @xcite . since in the rs model",
    "the radion is the only new state well below the tev scale , a low  energy effective theory including only the radion and sm fields is used .",
    "the effects of other heavy modes are accounted for by including non ",
    "renormalizable operators at the cutoff scale . in the absence of a curvature  scalar higgs mixing operator , the corrections from the radion are small , but give a negative contribution to @xmath0 . in the presence of such a mixing operator",
    "the corrections could be sizable due to the modified radion and higgs couplings .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ review - rs - gw - sec ] we review the randall - sundrum model and radius stabilization by bulk scalar fields .",
    "we also summarize the explicit example of @xcite which we will be using for our explicit computation of the radion mass and couplings to sm fields . in section [ coupled - sec ]",
    "we present our ansatz for the coupled metric and scalar fluctuations based on the analysis of @xcite of the radion without a stabilizing potential .",
    "we will derive a single ordinary differential equation , whose eigenmodes will yield the kk modes for the radion - scalar system . in section [ general - properties - sec ]",
    "we analyze the generic properties of this equation . in the general case",
    "we find that the system is not described by a hermitian schrdinger operator .",
    "however , we identify a convenient limit , in which the differential operator is in fact hermitian , and the eigenfunctions are manifestly orthogonal . in section [ approx - kk - sec ]",
    "we analyze the eigenfunctions in this limit , and find the approximate masses for the kk tower . in this analysis , the back reaction of the metric",
    "is neglected , which results in the lightest mode still being massless .",
    "the effect of the back reaction on the lightest mode is taken into account in section [ mass - sec ] , where we find the mass of the radion to be of the order ( but slightly lighter ) than the weak scale . in section [ coupling - kk - sec ]",
    "we discuss the couplings of the radion and the kk tower to sm fields on the brane .",
    "we find that the radion coupling is _ exactly _ agrees with the results in @xcite , while the couplings of the other kk modes of the scalar field are suppressed by the mass of the given mode , and is proportional to the backreaction of the metric due to the scalar background . in section [ cosmology - sec ]",
    "we demonstrate that in an expanding universe the shift in the radion at late times agrees with the 4d effective theory result obtained in @xcite .",
    "having established the mass and coupling of the radion , we write an effective lagrangian in section [ effective - lag - sec ] without any specific mechanism of radius stabilization and neglecting the contributions of the kk modes . in section [ curvature - scalar - sec ]",
    "we add a curvature - scalar higgs coupling to the effective lagrangian , and discuss how the couplings are modified .",
    "then , in section [ feynman - sec ] we calculate the feynman rules in a general gauge .",
    "these allow us to compute the oblique parameters via one - loop vacuum polarization diagrams with radions in the loop in section [ electroweak - sec ] .",
    "the radion correction is log divergent ( unlike the higgs ) , and so we also write the nonrenormalizable operators at the cutoff scale that provide the necessary counterterms .",
    "the size of the new contributions are shown for various cases in several figures in section [ numerical - sec ] .",
    "we also estimate limits on the radion mass as a function of the cutoff scale in section [ limits - sec ] .",
    "finally , we conclude in section [ conclusions - sec ] .",
    "[ review - rs - gw - sec ] randall and sundrum presented a very interesting proposal for solving the hierarchy problem @xcite . by introducing a fifth dimension where the bulk geometry is anti - de sitter ,",
    "a large hierarchy between the planck scale and the tev scale is obtained with only a mild finetuning .",
    "two branes are introduced , located at the boundaries of the anti - de sitter space . by tuning the bulk cosmological constant @xmath8 , the tensions @xmath9 and @xmath10 on the planck and tev branes , respectively , such that @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is the 5d newton constant related to the 5d planck mass by @xmath13 ) one obtains a 4-d poincare invariant solution .",
    "the metric is then @xmath14 where the planck brane and tev branes are located at @xmath15 and @xmath16 . for a moderate choice of @xmath17 , a large hierarchy between the planck scale and the weak scale is generated .",
    "since this solution is obtained for any value of @xmath18 , some mechanism is required to fix @xmath19 as opposed to some other value of @xmath18 .",
    "this must also be done without introducing any large finetuning .",
    "further , small shifts in the separation between the two branes do not change the energy , and so are described in an effective theory by the fluctuations of a massless particle , the `` radion '' .",
    "this particle couples like a brans - dicke scalar and must be massive to recover ordinary 4-d einstein gravity @xcite    one way to achieve these requirements is to introduce a bulk scalar field @xmath20 that has a bulk potential @xmath21 @xcite . to stabilize the brane distance , potentials @xmath22 on the planck and tev branes respectively are also included .",
    "the competition between the brane and bulk lagrangians generates a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) for @xmath20 , which results in a 4-d vacuum energy that depends on @xmath18 . for a simple choice of polynomial potentials a large hierarchy",
    "is then easily obtained with a mild finetuning @xcite , and the resulting mass for the radion is @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the phenomenology of the radion depends on the strength of its coupling to the brane fields .",
    "using the following nave _ ansatz _ to describe the radion @xmath23 @xmath24 @xcite and @xcite computed the normalization of the radion kinetic term to be @xmath25 fields living on the tev brane couple to the radion through the induced metric , with an interaction @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the canonically normalized radion , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the physical energy - momentum tensor of the tev brane fields .",
    "it is then clear that the radion couples as @xmath31tev to the standard model fields .",
    "obtaining an acceptable phenomenology then requires that the radion mass is @xmath32tev@xmath33 , which is easily satisfied by the goldberger ",
    "wise mechanism .",
    "the phenomenology of the radion is then crucially dependent on the normalization of the kinetic term .",
    "in fact , in the computation leading to the @xmath32tev@xmath34 prefactor in ( [ rkterm ] ) there is a cancellation between two terms of @xmath35 .",
    "the origin of this cancellation remains somewhat mysterious , and the absence of this cancellation would clearly lead to different predictions . in @xcite",
    "it was pointed out that there are additional contributions to the radion kinetic term not included in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the profile of the stabilizing field depends on @xmath18 , and so a small change in @xmath36 distorts the background field .",
    "it was found that this results in an @xmath35 correction to the radion kinetic term , thereby drastically changing the phenomenology of the radion .",
    "we review the resolution of this issue in the first part of this paper .",
    "some of the results presented in sections [ coupled - sec][mass - sec ] are already contained in the work by tanaka and montes @xcite , even though the results of this paper were obtained independently of ref.@xcite .",
    "we explicitly determine the wavefunction of the radion when there is a stabilizing mechanism .",
    "we find that the radion mass is typically @xmath32tev@xmath33 .",
    "in the limit that the backreaction of the stabilizing fields on the metric is small , we find that the correction of the stabilizing field to the radion kinetic term is subdominant to the gravitational contribution .",
    "we also find that once the stabilizing field has a non ",
    "zero vev , the kaluza - klein ( kk ) tower couples directly to the brane world fields , with @xmath37tev normalization , and amplitude depending on the size of the backreaction .",
    "the action we consider is @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the induced metric on the branes .",
    "the background vev for @xmath20 and background metric that preserve 4-d lorentz invariance is @xmath40 @xmath41 the einstein equations are then @xmath42 with @xmath43 . for this background",
    "the scalar and metric field equations are @xmath44 here primes denote @xmath45 , and we reserve @xmath46 to denote derivative with respect to the comoving 4-d spacetime coordinates @xmath47 .",
    "the boundary equations for @xmath48 and @xmath49 are obtained by matching the singular terms in the above equations .",

    "the virtue of this method is that for simple choices of @xmath55 it is possible to also solve for the backreaction of @xmath49 on the metric .",
    "this will be important for us , since we find that only after including the backreaction of the stabilizing field does one find that the radion acquires a mass .",
    "in particular , to obtain some analytic results the following superpotential @xcite will be used : @xmath56 with brane potentials @xmath57 here @xmath58 refer to planck / tev brane .",
    "the solution is @xcite @xmath59 the separation distance @xmath18 is then fixed by matching @xmath49 at @xmath60 and @xmath18 to @xmath61 and @xmath62 which gives @xmath63 .",
    "so the quantity @xmath64 is not a ( hierarchically ) small number , since both @xmath61 and @xmath62 are @xmath65 .",
    "this combination will appear later in the expression for the radion mass . also for future reference , since the backreaction corresponds to the second term in @xmath48 , the limit of a small backreaction is @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , but with @xmath68constant , so that @xmath69 is kept constant .",
    "[ coupled - sec ]    when @xmath70 there is always a static solution independent of the value of @xmath18 .. but only one finetune remains after radius stabilization @xcite . ] the small fluctuations in the relative position between the two branes then describe a massless particle ( `` the radion '' ) , and its wavefunction is @xcite @xmath71 and where @xmath72{6.5pt}{0.4pt}}\\rule[6.5pt]{0.4pt}{0.4pt}\\hskip-0.4pt\\rule{0.4pt}{6.5pt}}}}r=0 $ ] . since the coupling of the radion to the standard model fields is @xmath31tev @xcite , obtaining an acceptable phenomenology requires that this radion acquires a mass .",
    "we therefore consider the spectrum of perturbations about the above background which stabilizes the inter  brane separation .",
    "a general ansatz to describe the spin0 fluctuations is @xmath73 @xmath74 in order to describe all gravitational excitations of the model , one would need to add also the degrees of freedom in the graviton , by replacing @xmath75 .",
    "one can show that the einstein equations with this replacement will have the radion and the graviton decoupled .",
    "this metric ansatz ( [ a2 ] ) ( together with the two equations ( [ varphieq ] ) and @xmath76 which we will shortly derive ) fixes our gauge choice .",
    "one can show , that the effect of the remaining gauge transformations that preserve the form of ( [ a2 ] ) and ( [ varphieq ] ) just amount to a 4d gauge transformation on the graviton field @xmath77 and can be used to impose a convenient 4d gauge for the graviton . in the following",
    "we will only concentrate on the radion field . using this ansatz",

    "it is then possible to show that a solution @xmath78 to the above equation automatically implies that the @xmath80 equation and the remaining einstein equation are satisfied . in particular , starting with ( [ eheqn ] ) , one uses the derivative of ( [ varphieq ] ) to eliminate @xmath108 . the resulting equation , call it @xmath109 , is then differentiated and the combination @xmath110 is constructed . using the background field equations and ( [ varphieq ] )",
    "one arrives at the @xmath80 equation .",
    "finally , the @xmath82 equation is obtained from the @xmath111 equation after substituting for @xmath105 .",
    "[ general - properties - sec ]    first we show that the single ordinary differential equation for @xmath112 given in ( [ heqn ] ) can always be brought into the schrdinger form .",
    "for this we first transform the equations into the coordinate system where the background metric is conformally flat .",
    "this is achieved by the change of variables @xmath113 , where @xmath114 . in these",

    "after the rescaling of the field @xmath78 by @xmath116 we obtain the schrdinger - like equation @xmath117    however , this by itself does not guarantee hermiticity of the differential operator in ( [ schrodinger ] ) .",
    "the reason is that this operator is defined only on a finite strip , and therefore in addition to writing the equation in a schrdinger form one also has to ensure that one has hermitian boundary conditions for @xmath78 . for the differential operator in ( [ schrodinger ] ) to actually be hermitian on the finite strip between the two branes , one also has to require that for any two functions @xmath118 on the strip @xmath119 , where @xmath60 and @xmath120 denote the positions of the branes in the conformally flat @xmath121 coordinates",
    "once this condition is satisfied , it is automatically guaranteed by the usual theorems that all eigenvalues @xmath122 are real , that the eigenfunctions are orthogonal to each other and that they form a complete set .",
    "the actual boundary conditions that @xmath78 has to satisfy can be derived from the general boundary condition given in ( [ phibound ] ) . in the particular model considered in this paper the boundary condition in the @xmath123",
    "coordinates is given by @xmath124 in the special limit when @xmath125 this boundary condition reduces to @xmath126 on the two boundaries , which together with the constraint equation ( [ varphieq ] ) between @xmath80 and @xmath78 just implies @xmath127 at the two branes .",
    "upon transforming to the schrdinger basis and @xmath121 coordinates the boundary condition will be replaced by @xmath128 at the branes .",
    "this boundary condition clearly satisfies the hermiticity properties and thus will ensure the appearance of only real mass eigenvalues of the coupled system .",
    "this will also be the case that we will analyze in full detail in the following sections .",
    "as for the general case , when @xmath129 is finite , the boundary condition will not be hermitian .",
    "this can be easily seen from the fact that the general boundary condition involves @xmath105 at the branes , which should be expressed from ( [ varphieq ] ) in terms of @xmath108 , @xmath130 and @xmath78 at the brane .",
    "the appearance of @xmath108 in the boundary condition will generically ruin the hermiticity of the operator .",
    "nevertheless , one may eliminate @xmath131 in favor of the eigenvalue , and one can in principle solve for @xmath78 .",
    "the non  hermiticity by itself however does not mean that the eigenvalues are not real .",
    "in fact , since @xmath20 is a real scalar , and @xmath78 a component of the metric tensor , both of these functions have to be real to start with , which guarantees at least the appearance of only real eigenvalues .",
    "while for the model studied here ( see section [ mass - sec ] ) the radion is not tachyonic , it is unclear whether for a general potential this remains true .",
    "however , the orthogonality of the solutions is not guaranteed by anything , and will likely be violated in general for the non - hermitian boundary conditions .",
    "it would be interesting to understand the physics behind the non - orthogonality of these solutions in more detail .",
    "[ approx - kk - sec ] we have seen that the coupled radion - scalar system leads to a single ordinary second order differential equation . from now on we will always assume that we can use the limit @xmath132 , and be able to use the hermitian boundary conditions ( [ match1 ] ) . in the following we will present an approximate solution to these equations . for this , we will first neglect the backreaction of the non - vanishing scalar background on the metric .",
    "this will lead us to a simple bessel - type equation , which will give a very good approximation for the masses of the kk tower of the fields .",
    "however , surprisingly , in this approximation the radion ( which we identify as the lowest lying solution of ( [ heqn ] ) remains massless .",
    "therefore , after presenting this approximation , we will give a perturbative analysis for the effect of the backreaction of the metric on the radion mass .",
    "we will find that as expected , the radion mass will be of order tev , but somewhat lighter just as predicted in @xcite .    to find the actual wave functions and masses for the radion - scalar system",

    "@xcite and summarized in section [ review - rs - gw - sec ] .",
    "first we neglect the backreaction of the scalar field background on the metric , which seems to be a good approximation as long as @xmath133 . in this case",
    "the equation for the radion field @xmath78 reduces in the schrdinger frame to : @xmath134 where @xmath135 is given by @xmath136 in these coordinates the boundary conditions at the brane simplify to @xmath137 at the locations of the branes at @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "the solutions of these equations are given by linear combinations of the bessel functions @xmath140 and neumann functions @xmath141 : @xmath142 the mass eigenvalues @xmath143 can be determined from the boundary condition ( [ match3 ] ) .",
    "using the relation for bessel functions @xmath144 the boundary conditions at the two branes simply reduce to @xmath145 which yields the simple equation @xmath146 which can be used to determine the mass eigenvalues @xmath143 .",

    "[ fig : oscillating ] we show the lowest mass eigenvalues for @xmath147 , which corresponds to the somewhat unrealistic value @xmath148 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] we show the dependence of the first non - vanishing mass eigenvalue on the value of @xmath149 .",
    "one can easily see from ( [ bm ] ) , that @xmath150 is always a solution to ( [ bm ] ) , therefore in the approximation we are using the radion is still massless . for the higher states of the kk tower it is a good approximation to use the mass eigenvalues obtained from ( [ bm ] ) , because the masses are of the order ( and even larger ) than the tev scale , thus in the limit of small backreaction that we are considering throughout the paper these masses will be only slightly modified .",
    "the radion ( which appeared as the zero mode above ) however needs special treatment , since the shift in the mass ( which is usually negligible for the higher kk modes ) coming from the backreaction of the metric background due to the scalar field is the leading order contribution to the mass for the radion .",
    "below we will estimate the size of the radion mass in perturbation theory .",
    "[ mass - sec ] in the previous section we have seen what the approximate wave - functions and masses are for the kk tower of the coupled radion - scalar system . in this approximation of neglecting the backreaction ,",

    ", @xmath151 is always a solution with zero mass if @xmath152 is neglected in the bulk .",

    ", we will show how the backreaction generates a non - vanishing mass for the radion field .",
    "for this , we start with the equation describing the radion wave function in the @xmath123 coordinates : @xmath153 where @xmath154 is given in ( [ abackgr ] )",

    "@xmath156 the other boundary condition is @xmath126 .",
    "thus we will treat the backreaction as a perturbation , and look for the solution in terms of a perturbative series in @xmath157 .",
    "then we write the solution as @xmath158 expanding the solution as above and keeping only the leading terms in @xmath159 we obtain the equation @xmath160 along with the boundary conditions @xmath161 at the location of the branes .",
    "one can easily find the most general solution for @xmath162 from the equation in the bulk , which is given by @xmath163 where the integration constant @xmath164 along with the radion mass @xmath165 is determined by the boundary conditions at the brane . this way we obtain the radion mass to be @xmath166 where @xmath18 denotes the location of the brane .",
    "note that this result is very similar to the answer obtained from the effective theory computation using the nave ansatz@xcite , except for the important difference in the power of @xmath167 .",
    "the exact result obtained here scales as @xmath168 , whereas the effective theory result would scale as @xmath169 .",
    "it would be very interesting to understand the origin of this different scaling .",
    "for this model to give the correct value of the weak scale without reintroducing a large fine - tuning again one needs @xmath170 , thus the radion mass turns out to be somewhat lighter than the tev scale .",
    "it is suppressed by the factor @xmath171 compared to the tev scale .",
    "thus in this approximation @xmath172 tev , which could be at least in the range of a few gev s .",
    "of course , we need to emphasize that @xmath173 is not necessarily small for the stabilization mechanism to work , we took this limit only for calculational convenience .",
    "[ coupling - kk - sec ] in this section the coupling of the radion and kk tower of @xmath20 to the tev brane are obtained . in particular",
    "we demonstrate that the bulk scalar field gives a small correction to the radion kinetic term , and thus the kinetic terms obtained from the einstein ",
    "hilbert part of the action dominate , justifying the results obtained using the nave ansatz @xcite .    in the previous section",
    "it was seen that by including the backreaction an @xmath174tev@xmath175 for the radion is obtained .",
    "the wavefunction is then @xmath176 where @xmath177 is given by the integral of ( [ radwave ] ) . since the radion mass is @xmath174tev@xmath175 , and by assumption @xmath178 , we see by inspection that the backreaction induces a small correction to the unperturbed wavefunction .",
    "so for the purposes of determining the coupling of the radion to the tev brane it is sufficient to include only the unperturbed wavefunction , namely @xmath179 .",
    "then a straightforward calculation gives @xmath180 so the normalized radion @xmath181 is @xmath182 , since @xmath183 .",
    "this implies a coupling to the tev brane fields which is @xmath184 where the left hand side of this equation is a consequence of the fact that the induced metric on the tev brane is @xmath185 .",
    "the coupling obtained this way agrees precisely with ( [ rcoupling ] ) .",
    "this is perhaps surprising , since the latter computation used an _ ansatz _ which did not satisfy the equations of motion .",
    "this makes us suspect that results which depend only on the leading unperturbed form of the radion wave function will be correctly captured by the nave ansatz .",
    "now we address the issue that was originally raised by @xcite .",
    "is the radion kinetic term dominated by the kinetic term of the bulk scalar field or the bulk gravity action , and in particular is the former hierarchically larger ? to answer this , we need the change in @xmath80 caused by a fluctuation in the radion .",
    "since @xmath126 when the backreaction is not included , we must include the leading backreaction correction to the radion wavefunction , given by the integral of ( [ radwave ] ) . from ( [ varphieq ] )",
    "we compute that the change in @xmath80 to @xmath186 due to the radion is @xmath187 where @xmath188 this fluctuation in @xmath20 then contributes to the radion kinetic term at @xmath189 an amount @xmath190 from ( [ radnorm1 ] ) the unnormalized contribution from bulk gravity to the kinetic term is @xmath191 .",
    "so we only need to consider those contributions from @xmath20 which are comparable or larger to this . recalling that @xmath192 , it is seen that the largest terms in ( [ phikt ] ) are at best @xmath193 . explicitly performing the integral",
    "one finds that it is @xmath194 this is typically @xmath195 , which is smaller than ( [ radnorm1 ] ) since we assuming that the backreaction is small , @xmath196 , and also that @xmath197 to obtain a realistic hierarchy .",
    "so the radion kinetic term is dominated by the contribution from the bulk gravity , and receives a small correction from the stabilizing bulk scalar field .",
    "in section [ general - properties - sec ] it was found that for the simple boundary conditions @xmath198 ( corresponding to the limit @xmath199 ) a self  adjoint equation for @xmath78 was obtained . the general solution to this is @xmath200 where @xmath201 is a mass eigenstate , and the @xmath202 are some numbers .",
    "we expect that @xmath78 includes the massive radion , but where did all the other states come from ? it is helpful to reconsider what happens when the backreaction is neglected . in this limit",
    "the kk tower in @xmath78 completely disappears and only the ( massless ) radion remains .",
    "this may be observed from ( [ varphieq ] ) , since neglecting the backreaction corresponds to @xmath203 , and this amounts to setting @xmath204 .",
    "the only solution for @xmath78 in this case is the radion zero mode @xmath205 .",
    "once the backreaction is included , however , the fluctuating modes in @xmath20 and @xmath78 are correlated through ( [ varphieq ] ) . in particular , a general fluctuation @xmath80 induces a change in @xmath78 .",
    "the sum over kk states appearing above is then just the decomposition of @xmath78 into these kk eigenstates .",
    "it is then expected that the coefficients @xmath206 for the non  radion states to be suppressed by the backreaction .",
    "the preceding remarks imply that the tev brane fields , which couple to the induced metric @xmath78 , also directly couple to the kk tower , by an amount suppressed by the backreaction . since @xmath207 is already suppressed by the backreaction , therefore in order to compute the induced metric to lowest order in the backreaction we can use the zeroth order wavefunctions for @xmath80 .",

    "one finds the coupling @xmath216 the model - dependent couplings that appear are @xmath217 and @xmath218 is a numerical constant of @xmath219 .",
    "while the inclusion of the backreaction leads to a tev suppressed coupling for the kk modes , the size decreases rather rapidly due to the @xmath220tev suppression , as may be observed from inspecting fig . 1 .",
    "the coupling discussed here implies that the kk modes of @xmath20 can be directly produced at future colliders , and they also decay directly to standard model fields .",
    "this may be puzzling at first , since the stabilizing potential may have a global discrete symmetry , such as @xmath221 , which would navely imply that some of these kk modes are stable .",
    "the background vev for @xmath20 explicitly breaks this symmetry , however , and this allows for all the kk modes to decay into the brane world fields .",
    "the direct coupling of the kk modes from the stabilizing fields may have interesting implications for search strategies and current limits on the randall - sundrum framework .",
    "in particular , it may be important to _ not _ neglect the stabilizing potential when discussing these issues . however , when the backreaction is small , the size of their couplings is suppressed by @xmath222 compared to the that of the radion",

    "[ cosmology - sec ] the subject of brane cosmology has recently attracted lots of interest @xcite .",

    "walker ( frw ) cosmology @xcite .",
    "however , it did not take very long to realize , that this is simply due to the fact , that a generic brane model ( like the one presented in @xcite ) can not give the ordinary cosmological evolution , since gravity is in general manifestly higher dimensional .",
    "this means that in these models the 4d effective theory is usually not described by ordinary einstein gravity , but generically a complicated scalar - tensor theory of gravity .",
    "however , observations show that our universe is described by einstein s theory of relativity to a high precision , therefore one has to require from the outset that a brane model reproduces ordinary einstein gravity , at least at long enough distances .",
    "once this is achieved , the cosmological expansion will be automatically described by the ordinary frw universe , which simply follows from the fact that the effective theory is ordinary einstein gravity .",
    "thus one can see that the issue of unconventional cosmologies is nothing else but the issue of whether one recovers 4d gravity .",
    "this issue manifests itself in the case of the randall - sundrum two - brane model due to the presence of the radion field . without a stabilizing potential ,",
    "the radion field will be massless , and yield additional long range forces , and also contribute to the expansion of the universe , yielding an unconventional cosmology , which is presumably excluded by the requirement for a successful nucleosynthesis @xcite .",
    "thus the radion field has to obtain a mass .",
    "once it is massive , gravity on both branes will be ordinary 4d gravity , and thus the cosmology will be conventional below temperatures comparable to the radion mass .",

    "the cosmological expansion has been presented , where the wave function of the radion has been neglected , and also the effects of the stabilizing scalar field were included by adding a five dimensional potential for the radion field @xmath223 . assuming that that the potential @xmath223 is very steep , it was shown from a perturbative solution of the bulk equations that the ordinary frw universe is recovered .",
    "it was also argued , that the @xmath224 component of the einstein equation , which in the absence of a stabilizing potential usually leads to the unconventional expansion equations will only determine the shift in the radion field due to matter on the wall , and does not result in unconventional cosmologies once the radius is stabilized .",

    "so in an adiabatic approximation the leading order result using the nave ansatz should agree with that obtained from using the correct radion wavefunction , if the fluctuations in the scalar field are ignored .",
    "it is less clear why the full answer including the contribution from the scalar field turns out to be exactly equal to the calculation using the nave ansatz .",
    "note that matter on the planck brane causes a smaller shift in the radion compared to an equal amount of matter on the tev brane .",
    "this is because the radion wavefunction is peaked at the tev brane , and it couples more weakly to the planck brane relative to the tev brane by precisely the amount @xmath252 .",

    "the contribution of the higgs to the oblique parameters is by itself divergent , but these divergences are canceled by the contribution from the pseudo - goldstone bosons ( or the longitudinal states of the massive gauge bosons ) .",
    "thus for the radion one expects a divergent contribution , but in contrast to the higgs there is no additional source to cancel this .",

    "the explicit computation of the @xmath371 and @xmath372 wavefunction renormalizations demonstrates that the above operator has the correct relative factor between the two gauge bosons .",
    "this is perhaps non  trivial , since there is no additional degree of freedom to fix this relative factor .",

    "it is trivial to obtain the correct mass renormalization from ( [ op2 ] ) , since here there are two coefficients to be determined from only two constraints .",
    "so in addition to the usual standard model renormalizations , these wavefunction and mass counterterms are also required to renormalize the model .    the model with the radion represents an effective theory valid for @xmath376 .",
    "the dimension6 operators discussed above are obtained by integrating some unknown degrees of freedom in the full theory , and in the effective theory they appear with some unknown coefficients @xmath377 .",
    "these for example could include the effects of integrating out the heavy spin-2 kk modes . since the divergences for which the two above operators act as counterterms arise at one loop order , they are proportional to @xmath378 .",
    "thus it is reasonable to expect that the finite part of the operator is also of the same order , and in order to match the form of the explicitly calculated one - loop corrections we will write the ( finite ) coefficients as @xmath379 where we expect that the dimensionless parameters @xmath380 and @xmath381 are at most of order one .",

    "this amounts to simply replacing the @xmath390 poles in the gauge  boson self - energies with @xmath391 .    to compute the oblique parameters one uses the feynman rules in the previous section to compute the two feynman diagrams that contribute to the vacuum polarizations",
    "both diagrams have one internal radion , and one uses the three point function and the other uses the four point function .",
    "our convention for the sign of the vacuum polarizations @xmath392 is that    @xmath393    and only the first term is computed .",

    "the anomalous couplings are discussed in the previous section . by an appropriate rescaling of the coupling",
    "we can also use @xmath396 for the higgs .",
    "when @xmath397 , the results given below can also be used to compute the oblique parameters after an appropriate redefinition of the couplings and masses .",
    "the modification to the expression for the oblique parameters is summarized in ( [ generalx ] ) .",
    "inspecting the feynman diagrams for the vacuum polarizations one finds that the quadratic divergences cancel between the two diagrams , leaving only a logarithmic divergence .",
    "therefore this justifies the use of dimensional regularization .",
    "an explicit computation of the feynman diagrams in unitary gauge and for vanishing curvature scalar parameter @xmath269 gives @xmath398 where to avoid confusion with defining too many @xmath399 , the renormalization scale @xmath400 appearing includes the usual factors of @xmath401 and euler s constant @xmath402 . an analytic expression for the feynman parameter integral",

    "so the set of operators given by ( [ op1 ] ) and ( [ op2 ] ) provide an appropriate set of counterterms .",

    "one obtains for @xmath299 , @xmath418 inspecting the above expressions for the @xmath419 s one finds that there is no divergent contribution to @xmath318 , and this is consistent with the fact that @xmath420 and @xmath421 provide no counterterms for @xmath318 .",
    "it is interesting that the radion contribution to @xmath0 is negative and to @xmath317 is positive .",

    "then one obtains the usual positive ( negative ) correction to @xmath0 @xmath426 . for the radion",

    "we conclude with a comment on the decoupling behavior of the radion . inspecting the above expressions we see that for large @xmath429 the radion contribution scales as @xmath430 for the purposes of this paragraph we distinguish the cutoff of the effective theory , @xmath431 , from the mass scale @xmath432 appearing in the radion coupling . in our analysis we have approximated @xmath433 .",

    "but then the coupling of the radion to the gauge bosons contains the very large coefficient @xmath437 .",
    "it is then inappropriate to use the one  loop approximation .",
    "so to remain within the validity of the approximations used here one must also increase @xmath303 for large @xmath429",
    ". then the radion contribution decouples .    for large radion mass",
    "it is conceivable that the coupling of the radion to tr@xmath317 decreases .",
    "this can not be seen in our computations here because we have made the approximation of using only the zero mode wavefunction to determine the coupling , but have included the backreaction perturbatively to compute the radion mass .",
    "for very large radion mass these approximations are invalid , and then one must exactly solve the equations .",
    "it is then conceivable that for large radion mass the radion wavefunction on the tev brane decreases in such a manner that the coupling to tr@xmath317 remains natural , i.e. @xmath438 .    following standard practice we define a reference model in which one computes the oblique parameters within the standard model , which means for some specific value for the higgs mass . since the curvature scalar operator mixes the radion and higgs , the two physical scalars are some mixture of the gauge higgs and radion .",
    "this mixture is not a unitary rotation due to the kinetic mixing between the states .",
    "the couplings of the ` higgs ' in this case is somewhat different than in the standard model , and for the purposes of computing the oblique parameters it is easiest to think of this as a new model , rather than as a perturbation to the standard model .",
    "so in computing the oblique parameters the standard model higgs contribution ( for the reference higgs mass ) should be subtracted out , and the contribution of the physical states in this model added back in .",
    "that is , @xmath439 as mentioned , @xmath440 is the contribution from only the higgs , with mass @xmath441 and with standard model couplings , and it is independent of @xmath303 , @xmath429 and the curvature - mixing parameter @xmath269 . the quantity @xmath442 is the full sm contribution , with the higgs set at the reference mass @xmath443 .",
    "the new physics contribution contains two pieces , @xmath444 which describe the contribution of the physical radion @xmath445 , and the physical higgs @xmath446 .",
    "in the limit of no curvature  scalar mixing , this last contribution is just that of a standard model higgs with mass @xmath298 . for a general curvature",
    "scalar mixing one just needs to include the effect of the mixing coefficients @xmath228 , @xmath357 , @xmath358 and @xmath359 given in the previous section .",
