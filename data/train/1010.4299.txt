    "a substantial fraction of the star formation rate density ( sfrd ) of the universe at @xmath1@xmath132 occurs in young star - forming galaxies that can be identified through a significant lyman break in their spectra , so - called lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ; e.g. , steidel et al.@xcite ) .",
    "it was recently suggested that @xmath1325% of the stellar mass in the universe was formed in lbgs ( reddy & steidel @xcite ) .",
    "these galaxies typically have uv - derived star formation rates ( sfrs ) in excess of 10yr@xmath6 ( e.g. , nandra et al .",
    "@xcite ; reddy et al .",
    "@xcite ) , marking comparatively moderate star formation events in view of the @xmath102 orders of magnitude higher sfrs usually found in distant submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) and quasars ( e.g. , blain et al .  @xcite ; wang et al .",
    "however , due to the presence of dust in the star - forming regions , their exact properties ( and thus , the absolute contribution to the sfrd ) are difficult to determine ( e.g. , reddy et al .",

    "@xcite ; carilli et al .",
    "@xcite ; siana et al .",
    "it is thus desirable to study the gas and dust properties of lbgs directly , in particular through molecular line emission .    due to",
    "the low ( stellar ) masses and gas content of lbgs ( e.g. , shapley et al .",
    "@xcite ; compared to other systems observed at high redshift , e.g. , smgs and quasars ) , such studies are currently only possible in strongly lensed systems . due to lensing magnification factors of @xmath1030 , two @xmath1@xmath103 lensed lbgs were successfully detected in  emission ( baker et al .",
    "@xcite ; coppin et al .",
    "these observations revealed the presence of substantial amounts of molecular gas .",
    "however , recent studies of the ground - state  transition in high-@xmath1 galaxies have shown that this line appears to carry a higher luminosity than higher-@xmath11 co lines in many cases , and that the ratio appears to be a function of galaxy type ( e.g. , riechers et al .",

    "<S> we report the detection of  emission toward the lensed @xmath0 lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) ms1512-cb58 ( @xmath1=2.73 ) and the cosmic eye ( @xmath1=3.07 ) , using the expanded very large array . </S>",
    "<S> the strength of the co line emission reveals molecular gas reservoirs with masses of ( 4.6@xmath21.1)@xmath310@xmath4@xmath5@xmath6@xmath7  and ( 9.3@xmath21.6)@xmath310@xmath4@xmath8@xmath6@xmath9 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these observations suggest by @xmath1030%40% larger gas reservoirs than estimated previously based on  observations due to subthermal excitation of the @xmath11=3 line . </S>",
    "<S> these observations also suggest gas mass fractions of 0.46@xmath20.17 and 0.16@xmath20.06 . the  emission in the cosmic eye is slightly resolved on scales of 4.5@xmath12@xmath21.5@xmath12 , consistent with previous studies of nebular emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the molecular gas is associated with the most intensely star - forming regions seen in the ultraviolet ( uv ) . </S>",
    "<S> we do not resolve the emission in cb58 at @xmath102@xmath12 resolution , but find that the emission is also consistent with the position of the uv - brightest emission peak . </S>",
    "<S> the gas masses , gas fractions , moderate co line excitation , and star formation efficiencies in these galaxies are consistent with what is found in nearby luminous infrared galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> these observations thus currently represent the best constraints on the molecular gas content of ` ordinary ' ( i.e. , @xmath10@xmath0 ) @xmath1@xmath103 star - forming galaxies . despite comparable star formation rates , </S>",
    "<S> the gas properties of these young lbgs seem to be different from the recently identified optical / infrared - selected high-@xmath1 massive , gas - rich star - forming galaxies , which are more gas - rich and massive , but have lower star formation efficiencies , and presumably trace a different galaxy population . </S>"
