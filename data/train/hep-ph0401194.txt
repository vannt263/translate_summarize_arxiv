    "after many years of success of the standard model ( sm ) , the higgs mechanism is still the least tested sector , and the problem of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) remmains almost as open as ever .",
    "however , the analysis of raditive corrections within the sm @xcite , points towards the existence of a light higgs boson , which could be detected in the early stages of lhc @xcite . on the other hand , the sm is often considered as an effective theory , valid up to an energy scale of @xmath7 , and eventually it will be replaced by a more fundamental theory , which will explain , among other things , the physics behind ewsb and perhaps even the origin of flavor .",
    "several examples of candidate theories , which range from supersymmetry @xcite to deconstruction @xcite , include a higgs sector with two scalar doublets , which has a rich structure and predicts interesting phenomenology @xcite .",
    "the general two - higgs doublet model ( thdm ) has a potential problem with flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) mediated by the higgs bosons , which arises when each quark type ( u and d ) is allowed to couple to both higgs doublets , and fcnc could be induced at large rates that may jeopardize the model .",
    "the possible solutions to this problem of the thdm involve an assumption about the yukawa structure of the model . to discuss them it is convenient to refer to the yukawa lagrangian , which is written for the quarks fields as follows : @xmath8 where @xmath9 denote the higgs doublets .",
    "the specific choices for the yukawa matrices @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) define the versions of the thdm known as i , ii or iii , which involve the following mechanisms , that are aimed either to eliminate the otherwise unbearable fcnc problem or at least to keep it under control , namely :    1 .",
    "_ discrete symmetries . _",
    "a discrete symmetry can be invoked to allow a given fermion type ( u or d - quarks for instance ) to couple to a single higgs doublet , and in such case fcnc s are absent at tree - level . in particular , when a single higgs field gives masses to both types of quarks ( either @xmath12 or @xmath13 ) , the resulting model is referred as thdm - i . on the other hand , when each type of quark couples to a different higgs doublet ( either @xmath14 or @xmath15 ) , the model is known as the thdm - ii .",
    "this thdm - ii pattern is highly motivated because it arises at tree - level in the minimal susy extension for the sm ( mssm ) @xcite .",
    "radiative supression .",
    "_ when each fermion type couples to both higgs doublets , fcnc could be kept under control if there exists a hierarchy between @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "namely , a given set of yukawa matrices is present at tree - level , but the other ones arise only as a radiative effect .",
    "this occurs for instance in the mssm , where the type - ii thdm structure is not protected by any symmetry , and is transformed into a type - iii thdm ( see bellow ) , through the loop effects of sfermions and gauginos .",
    "namely , the yukawa couplings that are already present at tree - level in the mssm ( @xmath18 ) receive radiative corrections , while the terms ( @xmath19 ) are induced at one - loop level . + in particular , when the `` seesaw '' mechanism  @xcite is implemented in the mssm to explain the observed neutrino masses  @xcite , lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) appears naturally in the right - handed neutrino sector , which is then communicated to the sleptons and from there to the charged leptons and higgs sector .",
    "these corrections allow the neutral higgs bosons to mediate lfv s , in particular it was found that the ( higgs - mediated ) tau decay @xmath20 @xcite as well as the ( real ) higgs decay @xmath21 @xcite , can enter into possible detection domain .",
    "similar effects are known to arise in the quark sector , for instance @xmath22 can reach branching fractions at large @xmath23 , that can be probed at run  ii of the tevatron  @xcite .",
    "flavor symmetries .",
    "_ suppression for fcnc can also be achived when a certain form of the yukawa matrices that reproduce the observed fermion masses and mixing angles is implemented in the model , which is then named as thdm - iii .",
    "this could be done either by implementing the frogart - nielsen mechanism to generate the fermion mass hierarchies @xcite , or by studying a certain _ ansatz _ for the fermion mass matrices @xcite .",
    "the first proposal for the higgs couplings along these lines was posed in @xcite , it was based on the six - texture form of the mass matrices , namely : @xmath24 then , by assuming that each yukawa matrix @xmath10 has the same hierarchy , one finds : @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 . then , the higgs - fermion couplings obey the following pattern : @xmath28 , which is known as the cheng - sher _",
    "this brings under control the fcnc problem , and it has been extensively studied in the literature to search for flavor - violating signals in the higgs sector @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in studying the flavor symmetry option .",
    "however , the six - texture _ ansatz _ seems disfavored by current data on the ckm mixing angles .",
    "more recently , mass matrices with four - texture _ ansatz _ have been considered , and are found in better agreement with the observed data @xcite .",
    "it is interesting then to investigate how the cheng - sher form of the higgs - fermion couplings , gets modified when one replaces the six - texture matrices by the four - texture _",
    "ansatz_. this paper is aimed precisely to study this question ; we want to derive the form of the higgs - fermion couplings and to discuss how and when the resulting predictions could be tested , both in rare tau decays and in the phenomenology of the higgs bosons @xcite . unlike previous studies , we keep in our analysis the effect of the complex phases , which modify the fcnc higgs couplings .",
    "the organization of the paper goes as follows : in section 2 , we discuss the lagrangian for the thdm with the four - texture form for the mass matrices , and present the results for the higgs - fermion vertices in the charged lepton sector",
    ". then , in section 3 we study the constraints impossed on the parameters of the model from low energy lfv processes . in section 4",
    "we discuss predictions of the model for tau and higgs decays , including the capabilities of future hadron and @xmath5-colliders to probe this phenomena .",
    "finally , section 5 contains our conclusions .",
    "the yukawa lagrangian of the thdm - iii for the lepton sector is given by :    @xmath29    after ssb the charged lepton mass matrix is given by , @xmath30    we shall asuume that both yukawa matrices @xmath31 and @xmath32 have the four - texture form and hermitic ; following the conventions of @xcite , the lepton mass matrix is then written as :    @xmath33    when @xmath34 one recovers the six - texture form .",
    "we also consider the hierarchy : + @xmath35 , which is supported by the observed fermion masses in the sm .    because of the hermicity condition , both @xmath36 and @xmath37 are real parameters , while the phases of @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath40 , can be removed from the mass matrix @xmath41 by defining : @xmath42 , where @xmath43 $ ] , and the mass matrix @xmath44 includes only the real parts of @xmath41 .",
    "the diagonalization of @xmath45 is then obtained by an orthogonal matrix @xmath46 , such that the diagonal mass matrix is : @xmath47 .",
    "the lagrangian ( 2 ) can be expanded in terms of the mass - eigenstates for the neutral ( @xmath48 ) and charged higgs bosons ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the interactions of the neutral higgs bosons are given by ,    @xmath50l_{j}h^{0 }   \\nonumber \\\\                   &   & + \\frac{g}{2}\\left(\\frac{m_{i}}{m_w}\\right)\\bar{l}_{i } \\left[-\\frac{\\sin\\alpha}{\\cos\\beta } \\delta_{ij}+    \\frac{\\sqrt{2 } \\",

    "thus , the fermion - higgs couplings respect cp - invariance , despite the fact that the yukawa matrices include complex phases ; this follows because of the hermiticity conditions impossed on both @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the corrections to the lepton flavor conserving ( lfc ) and flavor - violating ( lfv ) couplings , depend on the rotated matrix : @xmath55 .",
    "we shall evaluate @xmath56 , by assuming that @xmath54 has a four - texture form , namely :    @xmath57    the matrix that diagonalizes the real matrix @xmath58 with the four - texture form , is given by :    @xmath59    where @xmath60    then the rotated form @xmath61 has the general form ,    @xmath62    however , the full expressions for the resulting elements have a complicated form , as it can be appreciated , for instance , by looking at the element @xmath63 , which is displayed here :    @xmath64 \\frac{(a-\\lambda_{2})}{m_3-\\lambda_2 } \\sqrt{\\frac{m_1 m_3 } { a m_2 } } +   \\tilde{b}_2 \\frac{a-\\lambda_2 } { m_3-\\lambda_2 } \\\\ & & + a_2 \\frac{a-\\lambda_2 } { m_3-\\lambda_2 } - [ b^*_2 e^{i\\phi_b } + b_2 e^{-i\\phi_b } ] \\sqrt{\\frac{(a-\\lambda_{2})(m_3-a ) } { m_3- \\lambda_2 } } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we have taken the limits : @xmath65 .",
    "the free - parameters are : @xmath66 .    to derive a better suited approximation",
    ", we shall consider the elements of the yukawa matrix @xmath54 as having the same hierarchy as the full mass matrix , namely :    @xmath67    then , in order to keep the same hierarchy for the elements of the mass matrix , we find that @xmath68 must fall within the interval @xmath69 .",
    "thus , we propose the following relation for @xmath68 :    @xmath70    where @xmath71 and @xmath72 .    then , we introduce the matrix @xmath73 as follows :    @xmath74    which differs from the usual cheng - sher @xmath75 not only because of the appearence of the complex phases , but also in the form of the real parts @xmath76 .    expanding in powers of @xmath77",
