    "the purpose of this work is to study the influence of a material curve on the behavior of two - dimensional ideal flows when the size of the curve tends to zero .",
    "the study of the fluid flows in a singularly perturbed domains was initiated by iftimie , lopes filho and nussenzveig lopes in @xcite , in the case of a smooth obstacle which shrinks to a point . for some initial data , they obtain a blow - up of the limit velocity like @xmath0 centered at the point where the obstacle disappears . for some other initial data ,",
    "they prove that there is no blow - up .",
    "six years later , the case of thin obstacles shrinking to a curve was treated in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the limit velocity always blows up at the end - points of the curve like @xmath1 . in light of this",
    "two works a natural question arises : what happens in the case of small curves ?",
    "our result can be stated as following : as the end - points get closer and closer , for some initial data , the two blow - ups like @xmath1 combine in order to give @xmath0 , and for other initial data , the blow - ups compensate each other and disappear .",
    "more precisely , we fix both an initial vorticity @xmath2 , smooth and compactly supported outside the obstacle @xmath3 , and the circulation @xmath4 of the initial velocity around the obstacle .",
    "we assume that the obstacle @xmath3 is a bounded , connected , simply connected subset of the plane .",
    "let us define the exterior domain @xmath5 .",
    "then , the vorticity and the circulation uniquely determine a vector field @xmath6 tangent to the obstacle such that : @xmath7    when the obstacle @xmath3 is smooth and open , it is proved by kikuchi @xcite that there exists a unique global strong solution to the euler equations in @xmath8 .",
    "if @xmath3 is a smooth curve @xmath9 ( with two end - points ) , we have to define what is a weak - solution .",
    "[ sol - curve ] let @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we say that @xmath12 is a global weak solution of the euler equations outside the curve @xmath9 with initial condition @xmath13 if @xmath14 and if we have in the sense of distributions @xmath15 where @xmath16 verifies @xmath17    in this definition , @xmath18 , and means that we have @xmath19 for any test function @xmath20 .    in @xcite",
    ", we prove the existence of a global weak solution in the sense of the previous definition .",
    "the idea of the previous paper is the following : for @xmath9 given , we manage to construct a sequence of smooth obstacles @xmath21 ( thanks to biholomorphisms ) , which shrink to the curve .",
    "next , we consider the strong solution @xmath22 in smooth domain @xmath23 , and we pass to the limit .",
    "the details of this proof will be presented in subsection [ thicken ] .",
    "however , we have constructed a special family of obstacles .",
    "the first goal here is to generalized @xcite in the case of a geometrical convergence of @xmath21 to @xmath9 .",
    "[ main 2 ] let @xmath24 be a sequence of smooth , open obstacles containing @xmath9 .",

    "another consequence of proving a geometrical theorem ( theorem [ theo - assump ] ) is the extension of @xcite , which corresponds to the previous theorem in the viscous case ( with navier - stokes equations instead to euler equations ) .",
    "the second goal of this article is to study the behavior of the weak solution when the curve shrinks to a point .    in @xcite ,",

    "additionally , @xcite proves that there exists at most one global solution of the previous limit system .",
    "therefore , we can state that theorem [ ift_main ] holds true for all sequences @xmath52 , without extracting subsequences .    in the exterior of the curve",
    ", we will note in remark [ rem : prop - curve ] that the velocity , for any weak solution , is continuous up to the curve , with different values on each side of @xmath9 , and blows up at the endpoints of the curve as the inverse of the square root of the distance .",
    "as it was said at the beginning of this introduction , we remark in this two results that the velocity blows up like @xmath0 in the case of a point , and like @xmath1 near the end - points in the case of the curve .",
    "the problem here is to check that we find a result similar to theorem [ ift_main ] when a curve shrinks to a point .",
    "we fix a smooth open jordan arc @xmath9 , and we set @xmath53",

    "the main tool is the explicit formula of the biot - savart law ( law giving the velocity in terms of vorticity ) , thanks to conformal mappings . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors use the change of variables @xmath61 , in order to work in a fixed domain .",
    "then they obtain @xmath62 estimates for a part of the velocity , thanks to the smoothness of the obstacle , and they pass to the limit using a div - curl lemma . in @xcite , the change of variables does not hold and we work on convergence of biholomorphisms when the domains change .",
    "next , we take advantage of this convergence to pass directly to the limit in the biot - savart law , thanks to the dominated convergence theorem . in our case of the small curve",
    ", we lost the convergence of biholomorphism and @xcite can not be applied directly .",
    "the curve being a non - smooth domain , because of the end - points , we can not either apply directly the result from @xcite .",
    "indeed , we will see that we only have @xmath63 estimates of the velocity for @xmath64 instead of @xmath62 .",
    "actually , we will improve some estimates and we will manage to pass to the limit with the div - curl lemma .",
    "the remainder of this work is organized in three sections . in section",
    "[ sect : 2 ] , we recall some results on conformal mapping and biot - savart law . we show that @xcite gives us the existence of at least one global weak solution @xmath55 for the euler equations outside the curve @xmath54 ( in the sense of definition [ sol - curve ] ) .",
    "we take advantage of this part to prove the convergence of biholomorphisms when an obstacle shrinks to a curve , completing @xcite .",
    "theorem [ main 2 ] will be a consequence of this section",
    ". there will be a general remark concerning the convergence of euler solutions when the domain converges . in section [ sect : 3 ] ,",
    "we establish _ a priori _ estimates for the vorticity and the velocity , in order to pass to the limit in the last section .",
    "we emphasize that the techniques used here , and in @xcite , are specific to the ideal flows in dimension two , around one obstacle .",
    "the study of several obstacles does not allow us to use riemann mappings .",
    "loosing the explicit formula of the biot - savart law , the author in @xcite choose to work in a bounded domain , with several holes , where one hole shrinks to a point .",
    "in a bounded domain , he can use the maximum principle , and he obtains a theorem similar to theorem [ ift_main ] . in @xcite , we work in an unbounded domain , with @xmath65 obstacles , of size @xmath48 , uniformly distributed on a imaginary curve @xmath9 , and the goal is to determine if a chain of small islands ( @xmath66 , @xmath67 ) has the same effect as a wall @xmath9 .",
    "concerning the viscous flow , there is no control of the vorticity in a domain with some boundary .",
    "therefore , we do not use @xmath68 and the biot - savart law , and we gain control on one derivative of the velocity thanks to the energy inequality .",
    "the case of a small obstacle in dimension two is studied in @xcite , and in dimension three in @xcite .",
    "the thin obstacle in dimension two is treated in @xcite , and in dimension three in @xcite .",
    "we note that there does not exist any result for ideal flow in dimension three .",
    "indeed , we can not use the vorticity equation , and we do not have energy inequality . then , a control of the derivative of the velocity is missing .    for the sake of clarity ,",
    "the main notations are listed in an appendix at the end of the paper .",
    "as it is mentioned in the introduction , complex analysis is an important tool for the study of two dimensional ideal flow outside one obstacle . identifying @xmath69 with the complex plane @xmath70",
    ", the biholomorphism mapping the exterior of the obstacle to the exterior of the unit disk will be used to obtain an explicit formula for the biot - savart law .",
    "a key of this work , as in @xcite , is to estimate these biholomorphisms when the size and the sickness of the obstacle go to zero .",
    "we begin this section by some reminders on thin obstacles ( see @xcite for more details ) .",

    "let @xmath100 be a jordan arc .",

    "then @xmath880 maps @xmath8 to @xmath119 and @xmath241 , @xmath285 .",
    "to finish the proof , we use the kellogg - warschawski theorem ( see theorem 3.6 of @xcite , which can be applied for the exterior problems ) , to observe that @xmath876 , @xmath881 and @xmath882 have a continuous extension up to the boundary , because @xmath844 is a @xmath846 jordan curve .",
