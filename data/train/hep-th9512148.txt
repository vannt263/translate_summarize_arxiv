    "much of the controversy surrounding discussion of the black hole information loss problem hinges on the question of the validity of the semiclassical approximation to gravity . in hawking s original analysis",
    "it was argued that back - reaction effects would be small and that the hawking modes could be considered as propagating in a background unaffected by their presence ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this assumption seems to lead inevitably to the conclusion that black hole evaporation leads pure states to evolve into mixed states . in recent years",
    "there have been a growing number of advocates for the point of view that the semiclassical theory breaks down in such a way as to restore coherence of the final state ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "some of these authors have claimed that within the context of a local field theory the reasoning employed by hawking is correct until late into the evaporation and therefore exotic string theoretic effects are necessary to resolve the information paradox ( @xcite ) .",
    "others have claimed that the breakdown occurs sufficiently early in the lifetime of the black hole to be visible within the context of the semiclassical theory itself ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "still others have argued that although the standard semiclassical results do break down , the low energy theory remains under sufficient control to permit explicit computation of nonthermal corrections to the hawking radiation ( @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we will attempt to shed some light on these competing viewpoints in the context of @xmath0 dilaton gravity coupled to massless scalar matter . using the techniques of  @xcite and",
    "@xcite we will completely integrate out the dilaton and the graviton and work with the effective quantum mechanics of gravitationally dressed particles .",
    "as such we have presumably completely included all the effects of gravitational and dilatonic fluctuations in the underlying theory .",
    "the resulting quantum mechanics is too nonlinear for full canonical or path - integral quantization .",
    "consequently we work in the wkb approximation and develop the leading corrections to the wavefunctions of particles propagating in a dilaton gravity background in the limit of small @xmath1 .",
    "these improved wavefunctions can then be used to repeat the traditional hawking analysis thereby providing the leading back - reaction corrections to black hole radiation .",
    "we work with the quantum mechanics of dressed particles as opposed to a dressed field theory because it is significantly easier to obtain the effective particle theory .",
    "we are actually interested in understanding the effects of back - reaction on the effective second quantized system .",
    "it is possible to recover some such insights from the effective first quantized theory by identifying the second quantized operators that produce the phenomena that we observe in a basis of states in the first quantized language .",
    "our philosophy for studying the back - reaction effects is the opposite of the approach pursued in  @xcite .",
    "those authors essentially integrated out the matter fields in order to include the back - reaction , while we integrate out the graviton and the dilaton .",
    "having obtained the effective quantum mechanics , we examine two situations in detail .",
    "first of all , we study the effect of the gravitational dressing of a single outgoing particle on the hawking flux .",
    "the analogous dressing of spherically reduced einstein gravity has been found to give energy dependent shifts of the hawking temperature ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , we find the temperature for radiation of dressed particles in @xmath0 dilaton gravity remains unchanged .",
    "this is so despite the fact that the wavefunctions and associated bogliubov coefficients are significantly modified by the self - interactions which produce an unusual renormalization of the kruskal frequencies of outgoing states .",
    "next we examine the outgoing radiation in the dynamical background of a single incoming quantum particle in an approximation where the self - interactions are turned off .",
    "the wavefunctions responsible for the late time radiation acquire large scattering phases that depend on the incoming state .",
    "in general we are able to identify the effect of an arbitrary incoming quantum wavefunction on the outgoing wavefunctions .",
    "these effects translate into phase shifts of the bogliubov coeffcients that determine the structure of the vacuum misalignment between the horizon and infinity . in the full second quantized treatment , these phase shifts should be operator valued expressions connecting the incoming and outgoing states . since the wkb approximation can be understood in part as a replacement of operators by their expectation values , our results allow us to identify the s matrix operator entangling infalling and outgoing states , at least up to certain normal ordering problems .",
    "the leading terms suggested by  @xcite and  @xcite , as well as subleading corrections are identified . despite the entanglement produced by this operator",
    ", the radiation is seen to be thermal in the approximation in which the self - interactions have been turned off .",
    "however , we argue that the non - commutativity of the in - out scattering operator with the self - interactions could bring out some additional information about the structure of the infalling state .",
    "finally , we examine the validity of the semiclassical calculations that give these results .",
    "we find that the computation of the bogliubov coefficients relating horizon states to asymptotic states is not reliable in the presence of infalling matter .",
    "the semiclassical method is only reliable when the energies of the various particles involved are small .",
    "it is seen that even a small incoming energy density leads to huge shifts in the energies of the outgoing states .",
    "the size of these shifts grows exponentially in time and suggests a rapid breakdown of semiclassical methods .",
    "moreover , we find that there are two complementary , semiclassically controlled hilbert spaces with which the system can be described .",
    "one is appropriate to observers entering the black hole and another is is suitable for observers of the hawking radiation .",
    "this lends support to the idea of black hole complementarity .",
    "in this paper we will be integrating the dilaton and the graviton out of @xmath0 dilaton gravity coupled to a fixed number of matter particles . since the theory is two dimensional , the fields have no propagating degrees of freedom and `` integrating out '' amounts to fixing a gauge that is consistent with the constraints induced by the presence of matter particles .",
    "the family of gauges we will choose is quite unusual and is closely related to the interesting parametrization of the schwarschild black hole adopted in  @xcite . in order to have intuitions for the effective theory",
    "it is useful to begin by displaying the classical black hole solutions of dilaton gravity in the same gauge so that we know how the space is sliced in the absence of any back - reacting particles .",
    "the action defining @xmath0 dilaton gravity is : @xmath2\\ ] ] with @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 being the dilaton , ricci scalar and cosmological constant respectively .",
    "coset theory given suitable conventions for the normalization of the dilaton and the cosmological constant ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is also the effective field theory that operates within the throats of four dimensional , near - extremal , magnetically charged , dilaton black holes ( @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the spherical reduction of einstein gravity gives an action identical to that in equation  [ eq : action ] with the cosmological constant moved out of the parentheses . ]",
    "= 1.5 in    classical solutions of this action and several close variants have been analyzed in detail in a number of papers .",
    "( for example , see  @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . for a good review consult @xcite .",
    ") there is a spectrum of black hole solutions which can be written in kruskal - like coordinates as : @xmath6 where @xmath7 can be shown to be the mass of the black hole .",
    "( the factor of @xmath8 which is absent in the solution presented by @xcite arises from a difference in conventions . ) a penrose diagram of this solution is displayed in figure  [ fig : kruskal ] .",
    "now consider the following coordinate transformation : @xmath9 the metric , and the dilaton are now given by : @xmath10 the important point about these coordinates is that the metric is stationary , and regular at the horizon while at the same time being asymptotically flat .",
    "consequently , the conserved energy defined as the generator of translations with respect to @xmath11 is the hamiltonian of the system and even applies to states in the interior of the black hole .",
    "the new @xmath12 , @xmath11 coordinates give a patch covering regions @xmath13 and @xmath14 of figure  [ fig : kruskal ] . by changing the sign of @xmath11 in the metric  [ eq : met1 ] we patch regions @xmath13 and @xmath15 . by further judicious changes of sign in the relations defining @xmath16 nd @xmath17 in terms of @xmath12 and @xmath11",
    "we get patches covering regions @xmath14 and @xmath18 and @xmath15 and @xmath18 .",
    "figure  [ fig : rtconst ] displays the surfaces of constant @xmath12 and @xmath11 in the metric ( [ eq : met1 ] ) for regions @xmath13 and @xmath14 that are of interest to us . in this parametrization",
    "the horizon is found at @xmath19 and the singularity is at @xmath20 .",
    "= 1.5 in    with these classical solutions in hand we can repeat hawking s calculation to evaluate the radiation streaming out of the black hole .",
    "the radiation arises because of a misalignment of the vacua defined with respect to inertial observers at the horizon and at infinity .",
    "the vacuum that is defined as the state annihilated by all states of positive kruskal frequency is found to contain a thermal spectrum when probed near future infinity . on the other hand the vacuum defined as",
    "the state annihilated by the asymptotic modes appears singular to inertial observers at the horizon .",
    "since the horizon should not be a locally distinguished location , we conclude that the physical vacuum is annihilated by the kruskal modes and that , consequently , there is radiation at infinity . in this paper",
    "we will improve upon the classic calculations by including the self - interaction of the outgoing radiation in the presence of incoming matter . for purposes of comparison",
    "it is instructive to first reproduce the hawking calculation in the context of @xmath0 dilaton gravity coupled to a massless scalar field .",
    "( see giddings and nelson for a clear discussion of a related scenario ( @xcite ) . ) in order to do this we must solve the massless wave equation in the background  ( [ eq : met1 ] ) to find a complete set of energy eigenstates and a complete set of kruskal momentum eigenstates .",
    "the former define the particle spectrum measured by the asymptotic observer and the latter are the states that have definite frequency with respect to inertial observers at the horizon . using the conformal flatness of the metric it is easy to show that the energy eigenstates are : @xmath21 where the upper sign refers to outgoing waves and the lower sign describes infalling waves .",
    "note that the outgoing energy eigenstates are singular at the horizon and therefore can not be extended into region @xmath14 .",
    "the kruskal eigenstates that define the particle spectrum at the horizon are found to be : @xmath22    in the region @xmath13 in figure  [ fig : kruskal ] the outgoing part of a massless scalar field can be expanded in either of the sets of modes @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "we write @xmath25 = \\int d\\omega \\left[b_\\omega \\phi_{+\\omega } + b^\\dagger_\\omega \\phi_{+\\omega}^ * \\right]$ ] . since each of the sets @xmath26 and @xmath27 is complete we can write : @xmath28 \\nonumber \\\\ \\psi_{+\\omega{^\\prime } } & = & \\int_0^\\infty d\\omega{^\\prime}\\left [ \\alpha_{\\omega\\omega{^\\prime}}^ * \\phi_{+\\omega } -    \\beta_{\\omega\\omega{^\\prime } } \\phi_{+\\omega}^ * \\right ] \\label{eq : bog1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the second equation follows from the first in view of the fact that the sets of states @xmath29 and @xmath30 are orthonormal under a klein - gordon inner product .",
    "analogous relations can be computed between the creation and annihilation operators associated with @xmath24 and @xmath23 .",
    "note that the coefficients @xmath31 measure the mixing between positive and negative frequencies that is responsible for the hawking flux . from the second of the equations  [ eq : bog1 ]",
    "we see that the bogliubov coefficients @xmath32 and @xmath31 can be computed by projecting out the components of @xmath33 that have definite frequency with respect to @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath34 the @xmath35 in the denominator is the spatial part of the energy eigenstate @xmath26 . these integrals can be computed exactly and give : @xmath36 where @xmath31 can be simply computed from @xmath32 by analytically continuing @xmath37 .",
    "it can be shown that since @xmath38 is independent of @xmath39 , the black hole radiates a flux @xmath40 given by : @xmath41 in other words , the flux is thermal with a temperature of @xmath42 .",
    "( we can see this also from the fact that kruskal eigenstates are clearly periodic in imaginary time with period @xmath42 . )",
    "all correlation functions in the final state can also be shown to be precisely thermal at late times ( @xcite ) .    in the above analysis we made no mention of the states in the interior of the black hole . as discussed in  @xcite we must augment the @xmath3 basis by adding modes defined in region @xmath14 .",
    "since the states in the interior of the black hole are inaccessible to asymptotic observers , we must trace over these interior modes to describe experiments localized in region @xmath13 .",
    "this yields a density matrix that is purely thermal .",
    "if this thermality persists all the way through to the endpoint of black hole evaporation , a pure inital state of the world will have evolved into a mixed state .",
    "this is the content of the information loss problem . in the next section",
    "we will construct the effective theory of particles propagating in a dilaton gravity background and ask whether the self - interactions and interactions with infalling matter modify the conclusions regarding thermality of the radiation .",
    "it is important to note that in order to compute the misalignment of the kruskal and asymptotic vacua it is necessary to understand the behaviour of all the excited states since the bogliubov coefficients depend on them .",
    "we are going to find that there are large effects that threaten the validity of semiclassical computations but that these effects vanish in the kruskal vacuum state .",
    "for this reason it may appear that the effects we compute are not important because , as discussed above , we specify the initial state to be the kruskal vacuum",
    ". however , the computation of the misalignment between the kruskal and asymptotic vacua requires knowledges of the behaviour of the excited states at the horizon .",
    "we will see that these excited states are very sensitive to self - interaction as well as to interaction with infalling states .",
    "in this section we will construct an effective theory of matter particles by integrating the graviton and dilaton out of the action for @xmath43 point particles coupled to @xmath0 dilaton gravity .",
    "we will work in the hamiltonian formulation of the theory for which purpose it is useful to introduce the adm parametrization of the metric : @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are functions of the coordinates @xmath12 and @xmath11 .",
    "we also define @xmath48 in terms of which the lagrangian in equation  [ eq : action ] becomes @xmath49 . in this parametrization",

    "the matter part of the action is : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the mass of the particle which we will take to be zero .",
    "adding @xmath61 and @xmath62 describes dilaton gravity coupled to @xmath58 point particles with @xmath54 , the total energy of the system , specifying the hamiltonian .",
    "note that in the combined action there are no time derivatives of @xmath45 and @xmath47 .",
    "consequently , these quantities can be integrated out of the action generating the constraints that @xmath63 and @xmath64 must vanish .    the elimination of the metric and dilaton from this action following the methods of  @xcite and  @xcite is described in appendix  [ sec : elim ] .",
    "since the technical details are quite confusing we will describe the basic idea of the construction here . since the dilaton and the graviton are not dynamical in two dimensions we can eliminate them by a choice of gauge .",
    "however , the gauge must be consistent with constraints that arise from varying @xmath45 and @xmath47 .",
    "put another way , the @xmath58 matter particles cause kinks in the geometry that move around with the particles .",
    "the action for the motion of these kinks is the only non - trivial contribution of the geometry to the dynamics . in eliminating the metric and the dilaton from the lagrangian we have to be careful to dress the particles with the action of the kinks in the geometry that they generate .",
    "the basic idea of  @xcite and  @xcite is to compute the contribution of a kink in the geometry by integrating up the constrained action for the geometry in the presence of a particle and then differentiating with respect to time to recover the constrained lagrangian . at first sight",
    "this seems a rather strange procedure - one may wonder why we could not directly fix a gauge consistent with the constraint .",
    "the reason for pursuing this awkward procedure is that the constraint produced by the propagation of a point particle contains delta function singularities and by first integrating past the singularities and then differentiating back we ensure that we are not missing any contributions to the dressed action .",
    "= 1.5 in      in appendix  [ sec : elim ] we have implemented the procedure for eliminating the dilaton and the graviton described in the previous section .",
    "it turns out that the geometry between the particles looks like a slice of a black hole of fixed mass .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : particles ] where @xmath65 labels the mass outside the ith particle and @xmath66 is the mass of the background black hole , if any .",
    "furthermore , in a gauge with @xmath67 and @xmath68 we obtain the following effective lagrangian for dressed massless particles : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is @xmath71 for outgoing particles and @xmath72 for infalling particles .",
    "this expression should be read as a hamiltonian formulation of the lagrangian ( @xmath73 ) so that @xmath74 is identified as the hamiltonian of the system and the canonical momentum of the ith particle is : @xmath75 this expression for the canonical momentum implicitly defines @xmath76 in terms of @xmath77 and @xmath78 and this chain of relations defines @xmath79 , the hamiltonian , in terms of the coordinates and momenta of each of the particles .",
    "@xmath65 should be thought of as the mass parameter of the geometry outside the ith particle and so @xmath80 can be understood as the energy of the ith particle .",
    "= 1.5 in      in order to understand the meaning of this effective lagrangian it is useful to consider a single dressed particle whose lagrangian is given by : @xmath81 here @xmath82 is the mass of the background black hole and @xmath83 is the adm mass of the geometry . at large @xmath12",
    "we can expand in powers of @xmath84 and we find that @xmath85 .",
    "this correctly tells us that near infinity , to leading order , the momentum of the massless particle equals its energy .",
    "we wish to interpret the effective lagrangian in terms of the diagrams that have contributed to the dressing of the particle . in flat space",
    "we should have @xmath86 , and in curved space the interaction with the background gives the classical equation @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a function of @xmath12 that can be read off from the geometry .",
    "in diagrammatic terms , the diagram proportional to @xmath89 in figure  [ fig : diags ] gives the classical description of a massless particle in curved space and the diagrams with more graviton legs represent the self - interaction corrections .",
    "indeed , writing @xmath90 and linearizing equation  [ eq:1part ] we find that : @xmath91 this is exactly the relation between momentum and energy for a classical massless particle in the dilaton black hole in equation  [ eq : newcoords ] .",
    "this agreement increases our confidence that we have correctly derived the effective theory and suggests that an expansion of @xmath92 in powers of @xmath93 amounts to a summation of the n - graviton self - interaction diagrams in figure  [ fig : diags ] .",
    "the lagrangian in equation  [ eq : lag ] contains graviton exchanges between all the particles in the system .",
    "we can truncate to exchanges of @xmath94 gravitons by expanding to the appropriate powers in the energies of each particle . note that for outgoing particles ( @xmath95 ) , equation  [ eq:1part ] tells us that a particle of finite energy has a momentum that blows up as @xmath96 .",
    "from the equations of motion computed below we will see that @xmath97 is the location of the horizon and the blowup is symptomatic of the huge redshifts between the horizon and infinity .",
    "having understood the dressed lagrangian describing particle trajectories that do not intersect we turn to the description of particles that cross each other . in the right hand figure",
    "[ fig : particles ] , we have two particles whose trajectories intersect . before and after crossing the two particle lagrangian  [ eq : lag ] describes the system , but we must give a prescription for determining the the mass parameter @xmath98 that determines the geometry between the particles after crossing .",
    "( @xmath66 and @xmath99 are unchanged because the former is the mass of the background black hole and latter is the total conserved energy . )",
    "the splicing prescription is derived from the observation that the crossing of particles does not involve any actual displacement so that we expect total energy and momentum to be conserved . applying this to the right hand figure  [ fig : particles ] and using the effective momenta given in equation  [ eq : can ] we arrive at the splicing condition : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the position at which the crossing occurs .",
    "letting @xmath102 and @xmath103 be the energies of the infalling particle before and after collision with the outgoer we can write the splicing condition as : @xmath104 here @xmath105 is the energy of the outgoing particle prior to the collision .",
    "we see that the energy of the infaller is shifted by the collision .",
    "the significance of this shift will be discussed in section  [ sec : break ] .      to complete the description of the dressed classical mechanics of particles in dilaton gravity",
    "we must compute the equations of motion since the classical trajectories will be necessary for the wkb quantization of the theory in the next section .",
    "since we are in the hamiltonian formalism the equations of motion are given by @xmath106 where all the @xmath78 and the @xmath107 for @xmath108 are held constant in taking the partial derivatives .",
    "generically , the classical kinematics of a highly nonlinear lagrangian like the one in equation  [ eq : lag ] can only be integrated if there are a sufficient number of conserved quantities present in the system . fortunately , because neither the dilaton nor the graviton is dynamical we expect that the energy of every particle ( @xmath109 ) is individually conserved in the absence of crossing of trajectories .    it is shown in appendix  [ sec : integ ] that the system of @xmath58 dressed particles is classically integrable since the @xmath76 are time - independent and have mutually vanishing poisson brackets . with this observation in hand",
    ", we derive the equations of motion by noting from equation  [ eq : can ] that the hamiltonian @xmath79 on depends on @xmath110 only via its dependence on @xmath111 which in turn depends on @xmath112 and so on until we reach @xmath76 which is implicitly expressed as a function of @xmath110 .",
    "so we have @xmath113 .",
    "these derivatives can be computed by differentiating both sides of equation  [ eq : can ] and rearranging terms .",
    "the subscripts indicate the variables in equation  [ eq : can ] that are to be held constant while taking the derivatives . putting everything together we find the equations of motion for the dressed particles : @xmath114 the integrability of the system now comes to our rescue - all the @xmath76 are constant and so we can integrate the equation of motion of the outermost particle , use the trajectory to integrate the motion of the next inner particle and so on until all the classical trajectories have been computed .",
    "if particle trajectories cross we must use one set of @xmath76 prior to crossing and another after crossing following the splicing prescription described in the previous subsection . for use in the next section",
    "we integrate the equation of motion of a single dressed particle : @xmath115 this equation of motion is identical to the equation for geodesic motion of a massless particle in the metric  ( [ eq : met1 ] ) for a black hole of mass @xmath116 .",
    "indeed , for an outgoing trajectory ( @xmath95 ) we see that the particle can only escape to infinity if @xmath117 . as discussed in section  [ sec : classic ] a black hole of mass @xmath116 has its horizon at @xmath118 .",
    "we see that at the level of the equations of motion a single dressed particle moves as though the metric is determined by the total adm mass ( @xmath83 ) as opposed to just the mass of the background black hole ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "we would like to use the effective lagrangian in equation  [ eq : lag ] to construct the quantum mechanics of the system .",
    "given @xmath43 particles we have a dressed lagrangian that describes the propagation of these particles within @xmath43 particle fock space .",
    "we need not be disturbed that the lack of a second quantized formulation will prevent us from seeing the particle production associated with the hawking radiation .",
    "the hawking flux is not associated with `` vertices '' in the usual perturbative sense of particle production - the hawking particles appear because of a mismatch of vacua between the inertial pbserver at the horizon and the observer at inifinty . given that we are in the n - particle fock space we do not expect the number of particles to change via interactions between the @xmath43 particles . therefore , given that @xmath43 hawking particles are produced , we can study their back reaction effects by constructing the quantum mechanics described by the lagrangian  [ eq : lag ] within the @xmath43 particle fock space .",
    "nevertheless , there is a difficulty with quantizing the system of gravitationally dressed particles . because the lagrangian is so nonlinear in the coordinates and momenta we can not simply promote these quantities to operators and canonically quantize the system since we would be faced with difficult normal ordering problems . the most reasonable procedure towards quantizing the system appears to be to study the semiclassical limit in which @xmath119 so that action of classical trajectories of the particles and the small fluctuations around these trajectories dominate the quantum physics . in the next section we will describe the wkb procedure for carrying out such a quantization and then we will apply the procedure to computing the wavefunctions of the dressed particles .",
    "the resulting states presumably include all the self - interaction corrections arising from self - exchange of the longitudinal graviton and dilaton .",
    "we are forced to resort to semiclassical methods to quantize the effective theory because it is too nonlinear for canonical or full path integral quantization .",
    "the basic idea of the semiclassical method is to observe that in the limit of small @xmath1 , the transport of wavefunctions is dominated by classical trajectories .",
    "( see gutzwiller  @xcite . ) in general , if @xmath120 is the wavefunction at early times , the transport of the wavefunction to late times is described by the equation @xmath121 . here",
    "@xmath122 is the propagator given by the path integral @xmath123 and @xmath124 is the action for the path @xmath125 . for small @xmath1 , extrema of the action",
    "dominate the path integral and the integral can be well approximated as the saddlepoint phase times the determinant of the quadratic fluctations around the saddlepoint .",
    "to use the semiclassical propagator to calculate the transport of wavefunctions we must calculate the above integral over the initial positions @xmath126 . because the propagator has been calculated by the method of saddlepoints ,",
    "it is only consistent to do the integral over @xmath126 by the method of saddlepoints as well .",
    "it is useful to note that the phase of the integrand is proportional to @xmath127 whereas the amplitude is @xmath128 so that the saddlepoint is consistently calculated from the phases alone . in other words ,",
    "we evaluate the integrand at the coordinate @xmath129 at which the phase of the intgrand is minimized and then we calculate the determinant of quadratic fluctuations around this point . because it is suppressed by a power of @xmath1 , the amplitude @xmath130",
    "does not enter the calculation of the determinant and is simply evaluated at the saddlepoint . putting all these facts together",
    "we arrive at the following expression for the semiclassical propagation of a wavefunction that starts at @xmath131 as @xmath132 : @xmath133 in this expression @xmath89 and @xmath134 are the self consistent solutions to the equations : @xmath135 the first of these equations is the equation of motion for the classical trajectory of energy @xmath89 that starts at @xmath134 and the second equation is standard relation between the action and the momentum of a classical particle .",
    "the semiclassical method requires that the frequency of the wavefunction varies sufficiently slowly for us to define a local energy in every segment of the wave .",
    "the content of the above equations is that this local energy at @xmath134 is transported along the classical trajectory of that energy that starts at @xmath134 and is deposited at the final point of the trajectory after a time @xmath11 . as a final check note that imposing the condition that @xmath89 is constant giving an energy eigenstate can be shown to yield the following wavefunction : @xmath136}\\ ] ] this is the familiar wkb expression for energy eigenstates in one dimensional quantum mechanics .",
    "we now apply this formalism to the gravitational self - interaction of particles in dilaton gravity .",
    "note that in computing overlap integrals of semiclassical wavefunctions it is only consistent to use the method of saddlepoints since the wkb wavefunctions have themselves been computed in that manner .",
    "we will now compute the self - interaction corrections to wavefunctions of single particles propagating in dilaton gravity . having computed the dressed spectrum we will repeat the calculation of the hawking radiation in section  [ sec : classic ] with the improved modes . in fact we will only work with the phase of the wavefunction because , as discussed above , the saddlepoints in the overlap integrals that give the bogliubov coefficients are insensitive to the amplitude which is suppressed by a power of @xmath1 .",
    "equation  [ eq : wkb ] says that the phase of the single particle dressed wkb wavefunction is given by @xmath137 where we have identified the energy of the particle as the adm mass ( @xmath116 ) minus the mass of the background black hole , and where @xmath92 is the coefficient of @xmath138 in equation  [ eq:1part ] .",

    "the self - consistency conditions in equation  [ eq : self ] are solved in appendix  [ sec : onewave ] to arrive at the leading order dressed wkb phase at late times : @xmath143 the late time wavefunction is @xmath144 and therefore looks exactly like the kruskal eigenstate in the initial condition with a redefined frequency . note that @xmath145 is @xmath94 to leading order for small @xmath94 so that states of small kruskal momentum are unaffected . however , as we shall shortly see , virtual states of very large kruskal momentum are responsible for the production of the hawking radiation and so this frequency redefinition is important for them .    having computed the one - particle dressed wavefunctions we are in a position to analyze the physical effects arising from gravitational self - interaction .",
    "kraus and wilczek have found that such self - interactions cause a energy dependent shift of the radiation temperature for schwarschild and reissner - nordstrom black holes ( @xcite , @xcite ) and it is interesting to understand whether such effects can occur in the context of the two dimensional black holes .",
    "we have computed the dressed analogues of the kruskal eigenstates above , and if we also compute the dressed energy eigenstates we can find the bogliubov transformations responsible for producing the hawking radiation . from equations",

    "we have not found a shift of the hawking temperature unlike kraus and wilczek ( @xcite ) .",
    "this is not surprising in retrospect because the temperature of dilaton black holes depends only on the cosmological constant and we do not expect the self - interactions of the matter particles to renormalize this quantity . nonetheless , the frequency redefinition derived here is quite dramatic and we may wonder whether there are any physical effects associated with it . to resolve this question we would need to compute the amplitudes of the effective wavefunctions and examine whether the n - point functions of the hawking state are changed .",
    "we do not expect any such changes because the frequency renormalization derived here does not mix positive and negative frequencies .",
    "the structure of the effective wavefunctions strongly suggests that the net effect of the self - interactions is merely a frequency redefinition .",
    "in computing the bogliubov tranformations we used only the leading order dressed wavefunctions in equation  [ eq : leading ] .",
    "one may wonder whether the subleading corrections could lead to nonthermal population of states in the radiation .",
    "we do not expect this to happen because the computations in appendix  [ sec : onewave ] show that the kruskal eigenstates will depend on time via factors of @xmath159 .",
    "consequently these states are periodic in imaginary time with a period of @xmath42 suggesting that the spectrum will look thermally populated even when the subleading terms are accounted for .    before concluding this section there are two more useful lessons to draw .",
    "the first is that the kruskal momenta contributing to late time radiation grow linearly with time and the second is that the self - interaction corrections are unimportant for infalling states . to show the first point we return to equation  [ eq : bog1 ] to express the dressed energy eigenstates in terms of the dressed kruskal states : @xmath160 .",

    "in fact in the small @xmath1 limit of interest to us here ( we are considering the limit where the semiclassical wavefunctions are reliable ) both integration measures yield the same conclusion concerning the values of @xmath94 that dominate the integral .",
    "this is because , in the semiclassical limit , the integral is dominated by the @xmath167 phases in the wavefunctions @xmath33 and in the bogliubov coefficients .",
    "this means that the @xmath128 measure in the integral is not important for determining the important regions of the integrand . ]    finally , we can ask whether incoming states are strongly affected by self - interactions . physically , we do do not expect large effects because the relationship between momentum and energy for incoming particles does not become singular at horizon .",
    "the lack of any large effects can be shown in the wkb lanuguage by taking @xmath168 , so that we have an incoming kruskal eigenstate as the initial condition , with @xmath169 in equation  [ eq : can ] for the canonical momentum . in the calculation of the dressed wavefunctions in appendix  [",

    "the equations of motion before and after crossing are : @xmath190 where @xmath191 and @xmath101 are the time and position at which the outgoing classical trajectory intersects with the incoming classical trajectory that starts at @xmath174 .",
    "this completes the specification of the leading order classical mechanics of the outgoing particles in the backgrounds produced by the infalling quantum state .",
    "these ingredients will be used in the next section to compute the approximate semiclassical quantum mechanics of the outgoing states in the quantum infalling background .      as discussed earlier the phase of the two particle wavefunction",
    "is given by : @xmath192 ( we have split the usual integral @xmath193 into the parts before and after crossing . ) performing the integrals we find : @xmath194 + \\frac{m_a}{\\lambda^2 } \\ln\\left[\\frac{e^{\\lambda r_c } - \\sqrt{m_0 \\pi}/\\lambda}{e^{\\lambda r_a(0 ) } - \\sqrt{m_0 \\pi}/\\lambda } \\right ] \\label{eq : ph1}\\ ] ] note that the equations of motion  [ eq : before ] and  [ eq : after ] tell us the ratios within the logarithms in terms of the time travelled before and after the collision with the infaller .",
    "using these relations in equation  [ eq : ph1 ] we find that the phase of the two particle wavefunction in the tadpole approximation is given by : @xmath195 so we need only solve for @xmath196 as a function of @xmath197 , @xmath11 and @xmath174 in order to compute the wkb phase of the two - particle wavefunction .",
    "let us take @xmath198 so that we have an outgoing kruskal eigenstate . using the equations of motion of the outgoing particle",

    "the semiclassical method is only valid when the energy of the incoming state is small compared to the mass of the black hole ( @xmath207 ) so that we can expand the @xmath208 to leading order arriving at the following expression for the phase of the two - particle wkb wavefunction : @xmath209 p_+ \\label{eq:2ph}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have identified @xmath210 as the outgoing kruskal momentum and @xmath211 as the kruskal momentum flowing in from the initial coordinate @xmath174 .",
    "comparing with equation  [ eq : kruskalout ] for the outgoing kruskal eigenstates we see that the last expression has the structure of a scattering phase shift induced in the outgoing state by the incoming state .",
    "first let us examine the structure of the two particle wavefunction in equation  [ eq:2ph ] .",
    "the leading term on the second line , @xmath212 is the two dimensional reduction of the shockwave interaction first advocated by thooft ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the term that is suppressed by @xmath213 arises because the position of the horizon moves when the infalling state falls into the black hole .",
    "this shift of the horizon `` squeezes '' the region outside the black hole causing a deformation of the wavefunction of states defined in the exterior region . in general , the term on the second line represents a scattering phase shift produced in the outgoing state by the incoming state and has a structure somewhat reminiscent of the exact s - matrix in the electromagnetic analogue problem studied by  @xcite .",
    "however , we do not expect the subleading correction computed here to restore the information about the infalling state to infinity since we do not have a systematic series of such corrections of the necessary structure .",
    "the two particle wavefunction in equation  [ eq:2ph ] can be used to identify the scattering operator that acts on the outgoing state in the presence of the infalling wavepacket . to do this",
    "observe that in the wkb method operators are essentially replaced by expectation values taken locally in every segment of the wavefunction with slowly varying phase .",
    "for example , the quantity @xmath214 is to be understood as an expectation value of @xmath215 taken locally in the neighbourhood of @xmath174 . indeed , identifying the momentum @xmath216 ( and similarly @xmath217 ) we can promote the coordinates and momenta appearing in the scattering phase shift computed above to operators and arrive at the scattering operator acting on the outgoing states up to ordering problems .",
    "this scattering operator has the effect of entangling the outgoing and incoming states .",
    "next , we calculate the hawking radiation in the dynamical background produced by the incoming state via computation of the bogliubov coefficients . in order to do this",
    "we need the the form of the energy eigenstates as measured by the asymptotic observer . using equation  [ eq : eeig ]",
    "we find the phase of an asymptotic energy eigenstate to be : @xmath218 note that @xmath148 diverges at @xmath219 where the horizon of the black hole is located after the infalling mode has fallen in . in previous sections",
    "we have only worked with states defined in the exterior of the black hole but in what follows we will need to augment the wavefunctions @xmath220 with modes defined in the interior of the black hole .",
    "this is necessary because the kruskal eigenstates in our initial conditions have support both inside and outside the black hole and therefore a full analysis of the final state requires modes defined in both these regions . since the definition of a `` particle '' is somewhat ambiguous inside the black hole , we are free to pick any convenient basis to augment the set @xmath221 . in the interior of the black hole",
    "we therefore pick the set @xmath222 where : @xmath223    in equation  [ eq : bog1 ] we had defined the bogliubov coefficients @xmath32 and @xmath31 relating @xmath224 to the kruskal basis . now define @xmath225 and @xmath226 analogously to relate @xmath227 to the kruskal states . using the relations  [ eq : bogints ] and their analogues for @xmath225 and @xmath226 we find that saddlepoint calculations give the following results : and since the computation of bogliubov coefficients is to be regarded as an overlap integral between semiclassical wavefunctions , it is only consistent to perform these integrals via the saddlepoint method . ]",
    "@xmath228 we have written these bogliubov coefficients as functions of @xmath174 in order to emphasize that @xmath229 is a function of @xmath174 and that the in - out scattering represents an entanglement that prevents us from separating the hilbert space into a product of incoming and outgoing states .    despite the entanglement produced by the scattering , since @xmath157 is independent of both @xmath94 and @xmath174 , the standard arguments used in section  [ sec : classic ] tell us that the kruskal vacuum state contains a thermal spectrum of particles of temperature @xmath42 .",
    "( see  @xcite and  @xcite for explanations of the standard arguments . )",
    "indeed , we can show that the final hawking state is left completely unaffected by the @xmath230 phase accumulated during the in - out scattering . to show this , let @xmath231 be the annihilation operator for the kruskal mode @xmath94 and let @xmath232 and @xmath233 be the annihilation operators for the asymptotic modes @xmath224 and @xmath234 defined in the previous section .",
    "then the bogliubov coefficients can be used to relate the various creation and annihilation operators ( @xcite ) : @xmath235 \\label{eq : adef}\\ ] ] the state of the system is defined to be the one that is annihilated by all the operators @xmath231 .",
    "putting in the bogliubov coefficients in equation  [ eq : boginout ] it is clear that the scattering phase can be factored out of equation  [ eq : adef ] giving : @xmath236 where @xmath237 is the kruskal annihilation operator in the absence of the scattering phase shifts .",
    "since the hawking state in the absence of scattering is the one annihilated by all the @xmath237 we can see that the same state is annihilated by the @xmath231 so that the in - out scattering does not affect the state at all . indeed , the only trace of the infalling state in the radiation is that the energy eigenstates are defined in a geometry whose mass is determined by the energy carried into the black hole by the infaller .      in previous sections",
    "we have computed the effects on the hawking radiation of self - interactions and of an infalling state .",
    "the former led to a renormalization of the frequency of outgoing kruskal states and the latter produced a scattering phase shift .",
    "we may wonder whether the two effects together can be responsible for any added recovery of information .",
    "the problem is that the severe non - linearities of the self - interacting system in the presence of an incoming state preclude analysis except in very special kinematical regimes .",
    "therefore , despite extensive calculations in the more complete scenario we will be satisfied with a qualitative discussion of the phenomena that can be expected .",
    "the in - out scattering does not commute with the self - interactions since the scattering shifts the phase of the wavefunction by an amount proportional to the outgoing kruskal momentum and the self - interactions renormalize this momentum .",
    "let us imagine that the self - interactions are turned off until @xmath141 .",
    "then as time passes , the wavefunction gradually renormalizes its kruskal momentum @xmath94 to @xmath238 $ ] .",
    "the scattering phase shift acquired upon interaction with the incoming state will depend on how far the state has been permitted to renormalize itself .",
    "this can potentially leave a trace of the time of interaction in the outgoing wavefunction thereby carrying out some information regarding the composition of the incoming wavepacket .",
    "careful scrutiny shows that the particular feature of the self - interacted wavefunctions that could carry this information would be the shifts @xmath239 and @xmath240 in exponent on the right side of equation  [ eq : iter2 ] .",
    "these quantities are expected to be shifted by the interaction with the infaller and will not cancel in the final state like the @xmath230 shifts in the previous section .",
    "in other words , the in - out interactions could affect the renormalization of the kruskal frequency in such a way as to enable some return of information .",
    "the results of previous sections appear to demonstrate that self - interactions and the in - out scattering have little effect on the late time radiation despite dramatic effects on the individual states involved in the computation . in this section",
    "we will address some consequences of the fact that the results in the previous sections also demonstrate that the semiclassical approximation is breaking down rapidly .    to see this , note that the semiclassical methods are only valid when the energies of the particles involved are small .",
    "now , given the bogliubov coefficients in equation  [ eq : boginout ] , an energy eigenstate of energy @xmath155 in the region outside the black hole can be constructed from the kruskal states as @xmath241 $ ] .",
    "it is easily shown that this integral is dominated by modes with : @xmath242 since the typical late time radiation has energy @xmath243 , this means that the modes that contribute to the hawking flux have a kruskal momentum @xmath94 that is growing exponentially in time .",
    "now , the equation @xmath244 combined with equation  [ eq : ps ] before the collision and the kruskal initial condition for @xmath245 gives the relation @xmath246 . using the solution for @xmath205 arrived at in section  [ sec : tad2part ]",
    "we find that the energy of the outgoing state prior to scattering from the incoming state is given by : @xmath247 with @xmath248 .",
    "since @xmath94 is growing exponentially in time we see that the hawking flux emerges from states dominated by classical trajectories that have exponentially high energies before collision with the infalling state . at the formal level",
    "this invalidates the semiclassical approach and suggests that the results of previous sections should not be believed .    in the calculation of the hawking radiation",
    ", there are no real particles in the system that have these high energies since the state is defined to be the kruskal vacuum .",
    "therefore , a common argument says , the large shifts described above do not threaten the validity of the semiclassical computations .",
    "however , the calculation of the misalignment of kruskal and asymptotic vacua requires use of the bogliubov coefficients which depend on the excited states of the system .",
    "so , even if the system is placed in an initial state which apparently acquires no semiclassical corrections ( being a state of kruskal momentum zero ) the calculation of bogliubov coefficients has limited validity because of the large corrections to the excited states .",
    "put another way , the precise form of the vacuum redefinition depends on the behaviour of modes of nonzero kruskal momentum which acquire large corrections . a way to see",
    "this explicitly is in the formula for the hawking state @xmath249 where @xmath32 and @xmath31 are `` matrices '' of bogliubov coefficients @xmath250 and @xmath251 and the operators @xmath252 create asymptotic states .",
    "( this can be derived as the solution to the condition that the hawking state is annihilated by the kruskal mode operators (  @xcite ) . )",
    "this formula has the structure of pairs of particles coming out of some loop diagram as in figure  [ fig : create ] .",
    "the matrix product @xmath253 involves a sum on intermediate kruskal states and is essentially a summation over the particles running around the loops in figure  [ fig : create ] . as discussed earlier , the states in these loops have energies that grow exponentially with time prior to scattering from the incoming state .",
    "this suggests that we simply do not have sufficient control over the summation on virtual processes implicit in the computation of the hawking state to be able to believe that the semiclassical results have exact validity .",
    "we may fear that the results presented here are gauge dependent since we are working with a particular parametrization of the dilaton black hole .",
    "however , this fear is allayed by observing that the method of this paper is to compute the the wkb phase which is given by @xmath254 , a reparametrization invariant quantity .",
    "so the exponentially large scattering phase shifts that threaten the validity of the semiclassical calculations should appear in any parametrization including one that only uses the `` nice slices '' of  @xcite .",
    "another objection that is sometimes raised is that arguments regarding the breakdown of the semiclassical approximation involve `` postdiction '' whereby we try to reason about the states from which a low energy state at the current time could have developed .",
    "it has been argued that difficulties with such `` postdiction '' should not be interpreted as evidence for breakdown of the semiclassical theory ( @xcite ) . in fact , the problem should rather be phrased in terms of the structure of the hilbert space on which the field theory is defined as we will discuss in the next section .",
    "as discussed above , the hawking state is calculated by computing the misalignment between the vacuum defined by inertial observers at the black hole horizon and by obervers at infinity .",
    "this misalignment depends on the structure of the excited states of the system . in the presence of infalling matter",
    ", the hilbert space contains both an infalling and outgoing component . in section  [ sec : leading ] the states in this in - out hilbert space were approximated by removing the self - interactions and by having the infalling state propagate in the static background black hole while the outgoing state propagated in the quantum mechanical geometry thus produced .",
    "in fact , a complete treatment involves a study of two particle states with one infaller and one outgoer treated with the two particle version of the self - interacted lagrangian  [ eq : lag ] . in this section",
    "we consider such two particle states and find that the interactions between the infaller and outgoer lead to serious difficulties with the definition of the hilbert space .    using the conventions of the right - hand figure  [ fig : particles ] we take @xmath255 and @xmath256 to be the energies of the outgoing and incoming particles before scattering .",
    "similarly , take @xmath257 and @xmath258 to be the energies of the outgoing and incoming particles after scattering .",
    "we will begin by assuming that all these energies are much smaller than the black hole mass so that the semiclassical treatment is valid and show that in the kinematical regime relevant to the hawking radiation , we are driven well out of the regime of validity .",
    "the splicing prescription in equation  [ eq : bsplice ] gives @xmath259 in terms of the incoming energies and the position @xmath101 at which the scattering occurs . using the splicing prescription and energy conservation with the two particle equations of motion derived in section  [ sec : eom ]",
    ", we can imitate the analysis of the self - interactions and the in - out scattering in sections  [ sec : selfcorr ] and  [ sec : leading ] .",
    "define @xmath260 and @xmath261 .",
    "then , given some infalling energy @xmath262 , it is easy to show that at late times on @xmath263 , when @xmath264 , the following results hold in the leading order : @xmath265 where we have defined the self - interaction renormalized frequency : @xmath266 here we have used the fact that the energies of the particles are assumed to be small to use the approximations made in the section on self - interaction corrections , as well as to drop some terms of order @xmath267 which give negligible corrections to the equations of motion of the outgoing particle prior to scattering .",
    "we are now in a position to extract the most important physical consequences of the self - interacted in - out scattering .",
    "first of all , the results on the self - interactions and in - out scattering have told us that the typical energy of the outgoing particle is unchanged from the classic result and will be @xmath268 .",
    "so , from equation  [ eq : ms ] , @xmath269 .",
    "from the definition of @xmath270 we see that @xmath39 is growing exponentially with time .",
    "now consider a low energy mode dropped into the black hole with some small @xmath271 . looking at the solution for @xmath272 , and using the exponential growth of @xmath39 , we see that the state in the two particle hilbert space responsible for producing the late - time hawking radiation is dominated by classical trajectories with exponentially large energies before scattering from the infalling state .",
    "the first lesson of these huge energy shifts is that states of absurdly high energies will have to be admitted into the hilbert space on the early slice to produce the states on the late slice necessary to support the hawking radiation .",
    "furthermore , if we require that we are able to observe late time hawking radiation of reasonable energies , then equation  [ eq : ms ] shows that low - energy infalling modes will necessarily be scattered by the outgoer into states inside the black hole with extremely large energies .",
    "the huge energies developed by the particles can also be rewritten as the difference in the masses of the geometries on either side of the particle . if we would require the mass of the internal black hole @xmath66 to remain fixed , the huge energies into which the infalling particle is scattered imply that we would have to admit states of absurdly high adm mass into the late slice hilbert space .",
    "this would clearly be unphysical .",
    "instead , we should require that the total energy of the system , as given by the adm mass , remains at some reasonable fixed values @xmath99 , and consider the states of the system with this total energy . in that case , the huge energies into which the infalling particles are scattered imply that the interior black hole geometry must have a negative mass thereby displaying a naked singularity .",
    "( see figure  [ fig : geom ] . ) both alternatives , absurdly high energy states in the hilbert space and naked singularity geometries , seem quite unpalatable .",
    "there are two complementary ways to avoid both difficulties .",
    "the first is to require that the radiation observed at late times has exponentially small energies so that the states in the hilbert space that are responsible for producing the radiation never have energies exceeding some finite cutoff .",
    "this allows the infalling matter to propagate into the black hole interior without developing very high energies on the late time slice .",
    "this prescription therefore gives a construction of a hilbert space appropriate to an infalling observer .",
    "however , this seems like an unacceptable solution to an outside observer since it involves a drastic cutoff on the outgoing modes that tends to zero energy at late times . the complementary solution is to restrict the infalling modes to have exponentially small energies . under this circumstance also , the states in the late time hilbert space remain well defined .",
    "however , this prescription clearly imposes severe restrictions on the physics that the infalling observer can observe .    the dilemma seems to force the conclusion that the semiclassical theory of hawking radiation , even with the self - interaction corrections , breaks down rapidly .",
    "furthermore , there are two complementary , semiclassically controlled hilbert spaces at late times .",
    "one is appropriate for describing the physics seen by the infaller , and the other is appropriate to a description of the hawking radiation .",
    "it is possible that these complementary hilbert spaces should be identified in some way giving a realization of black hole complementarity .",
    "in this paper we have studied back - reaction effects in hawking radiation from @xmath0 dilaton black holes .",
    "first of all , we constructed the effective theory produced by integrating out gravity and the dilaton and used this to study the self - interaction of the hawking radiation .",
    "we found an unusual renormalization of the kruskal frequency of outgoing states that nevertheless left the hawking temperature unchanged .",
    "then we studied the radiation issuing from a dynamical background produced by a quantum mechanical state falling into a black hole .",
    "this calculation was carried out in an approximation where the self - interactions were removed in order to examine the scattering effects separately .",
    "the in - out interaction was found to produce large scattering phases in outgoing states that nevertheless conspire to leave the hawking state essentially unchanged .",
    "finally , we asked whether these semiclassical conclusions could be trusted .",
    "we displayed the evidence that semiclassical methods have limited validity in constructing the hilbert space on late slices .",
    "we concluded from this that the structure of the semiclassically controlled hilbert space supports a formulation of black hole complementarity .",

    "we would also like to thank curt callan for extensive discussions and for collaboration in the early part of this work .",

    "in this appendix we will discuss the derivation of the effective action for dressed particles in @xmath0 dilaton gravity . the derivation will closely follow the work of kraus and wilczek ( @xcite ) as well as  @xcite .",
    "the reader is referred to these references for more detailed discussions - the basic steps are reproduced here mainly for ease of reference .",
    "figure  [ fig : particles ] is a useful picture of the scenario being considered .",
    "the plan of this section is as follows .",
    "first we implement the constraints in @xmath0 dilaton gravity and integrate the action for an arbitrary constrained trajectory of the geometry and the particles propagating in it . differentiating this action with respect to time",
    "gives a lagrangian in which the constraints have been incorporated .",
    "fixing a gauge to eliminate redundant degrees of freedom yields the effective lagrangian for dressed particles .    in section",
    "[ sec : dress ] we presented the hamiltonian formulation of @xmath0 dilaton gravity coupled to @xmath43 matter particles . since the resulting action did not contain time derivatives of the variables @xmath273 and @xmath274 , these quantities can be integrated out generating the constraints that @xmath275 and @xmath276 . by considering the linear combination of constraints @xmath277 where the prime denotes @xmath278 we find that : @xmath279 \\delta(r- r_i(t ) ) = 0\\ ] ] with @xmath280 given by : @xmath281\\ ] ] this tells us that in the regions away from each of the particles the quantity @xmath280 is constant and these constants have been labelled @xmath76 in figure  [ fig : particles ] .",
    "indeed it can be shown that in the regions between the particles the geometry is that of a black hole of mass @xmath65 . since equation  [ eq : constrt1 ] tells us that @xmath76 is independent of @xmath12 we can invert the relationship in equation  [ eq : meq ] to find the following expressions for @xmath51 and @xmath52 : @xmath282^{1/2 } \\ : \\ : \\ : ; \\ : \\ :",
    "\\pi_r = \\pi_l{^\\prime}l/ r{^\\prime}\\ ] ] the equation for @xmath52 is taken straight from the expression for the constraint @xmath283 in equation  [ eq : rconsrt ] . to find the relationship between the @xmath76 we observe that the constraints at the are consistent with @xmath46 and @xmath53 being continuous at the positions of the particles with @xmath51 and @xmath52 free from singularities there .",
    "then , integrating the constraints @xmath284 and @xmath285 across the positions of the particles gives : @xmath286 in these equations , @xmath287 refers to the position of the ith particle .",
    "simultaneous solutions of each pair of equations for each @xmath288 expresses @xmath76 in terms of @xmath77 and @xmath110 .",
    "we now follow the procedure of kraus and wilczek to derive the effective action for the dressed particle trajectories .",
    "the idea is that the particles drag kinks in the geometry around with them and we seek to include the contribution of these kinks to the action as part of the gravitational dressing of the particles themselves . to do this",
    "we will work with a single particle in dilaton gravity - the generalization to @xmath43 particles that do not cross will be trivial since we will just have to add similar pieces for every particle in the system .",
    "so we consider a single particle trajectory @xmath289 in figure  [ fig : particles ] with @xmath66 being the mass of the geometry for @xmath290 and @xmath116 , the mass for @xmath291 , is the adm mass and hamiltonian of the system .",
    "we begin by noting that the action for an infinitesimal variation of the geometry and particle trajectory is @xmath292 .",
    "we want to integrate @xmath293 for paths of the system that obey the constraints .",
    "the key observation is that for @xmath294 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are fixed by the constraints as a function of @xmath46 and @xmath53 .",
    "consequently , the hamilton - jacobi function for a trajectory of the geometry , @xmath295 is independent of trajectory and is a function only of endpoints .",
    "let us first consider trajectories of the geometry that leave @xmath82 and @xmath83 fixed . in the regions @xmath296 and @xmath297 we can follow  @xcite to integrate @xmath124 from a configuration a to a configuration b as follows . starting from any configuration",
    "we can integrate @xmath298 along a path of constant @xmath299 to a configuration with @xmath300 .",
    "this configuration has @xmath301 and is therefore static .",
    "then holding this relation between @xmath302 and @xmath46 fixed we integrate to some other standard static configuration .",
    "the second leg of the integration has @xmath301 and so does not contribute anything . to integrate between any pair of configurations @xmath303 and @xmath304 we integrate in this manner from @xmath303 to the standard configuration and from there to @xmath304 .",
    "this gives the following action for the motion of the geometry in the regions @xmath291 and @xmath290 in which we have dropped the constant arising from the lower limit of the @xmath46 integration : @xmath305 where we define @xmath306 and @xmath307\\ ] ] equation  [ eq : tempac ] is the action for a trajectory for which there are no variations of the geometry at @xmath308 , the position of the shell and which keeps the mass @xmath83 constant . to find the action for a general trajectory of the geometry",
    "consider a general variation of equation  [ eq : tempac ] with respect to @xmath46 and @xmath53 .",
    "we find that : @xmath309     + \\left[\\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial r{^\\prime}}(r_1 + \\epsilon )       - \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial r{^\\prime}}(r_1 - \\epsilon ) \\right ]        d\\hat{r } + \\nonumber \\\\ &    \\int_{r_1}^{\\infty } dr \\ , \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial m_1 } \\ , dm_1   \\label{eq : var}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath310 represents the total variation in @xmath53 at the position of the particle and @xmath311 is the variation in the adm mass caused by an arbitrary variation of @xmath46 and @xmath53 .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath310 arises because @xmath302 is constrained to be discontinuous across the position of the particle ( equation  [ eq : piconstrt ] ) and represents the contribution of the kink in the geometry .",
    "the terms proportional to @xmath311 arises because a general variation of the geometry can change the mass of the system .",
    "there is no contribution from @xmath312 because we assume that the mass of the background black hole is held fixed . since we must require that @xmath313 and @xmath314 we must subtract the integrated contribution of the two anomalous variations on the right of equation  [ eq : var ] . putting everything together we arrive at the following action for a constrained variation of dilaton - gravity coupled to a single particle : @xmath315 - \\nonumber \\\\ & \\int_0^t dt\\ , \\int_{r_1}^{\\infty } dr \\frac{dm_1}{dt }                          \\frac{\\partial f_1}{\\partial m_1 }   \\ : - \\ :   \\int_0^t dt\\ , \\frac{m_1}{\\lambda } \\label{eq : totac}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath316 is the value of @xmath53 at the position of the particle .",
    "although we have not explicitly considered the contribution of a variation of @xmath308 to the action , the integrability of the equations ensures that such a piece has been included as can be checked by explicitly differentiating back .",
    "we are now in a position to derive the effective constrained lagrangian for this system by differentiating the action in equation  [ eq : totac ] . indeed , writing @xmath317 , and using the integrated constraints for a massless particle ( @xmath318 ) in equation  [ eq : piconstrt ] in imitation of kraus and wilczek (  @xcite ) , we find the following lagrangian : @xmath319 - \\nonumber \\\\ & \\eta \\frac{2 \\hat{r } \\dot{\\hat{r } } } { \\pi } \\ln\\left [ \\frac{(r{^\\prime}/l ) _ > - \\eta \\left.\\sqrt{\\left ( r{^\\prime}/l \\right)^2 - b_1 ^ 2 } \\right| _ > } { ( r{^\\prime}/l ) _ < - \\eta \\left.\\sqrt{\\left ( r{^\\prime}/l \\right)^2 - b_0 ^ 2 } \\right| _ < } \\right ] + \\nonumber \\\\ & \\int_0^{r_1 - \\epsilon } dr \\ , \\left[\\pi_l \\dot{l } + \\pi_r \\dot{r } \\right ] +   \\int_{r+1 + \\epsilon}^{\\infty } dr \\ , \\left[\\pi_l \\dot{l } + \\pi_r \\dot{r } \\right ]   -   \\frac{m_1}{\\lambda}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this equation @xmath320 and @xmath321 indicate positions on either side of the particle at @xmath308 that are infinitesimally close by , but not subject to the constraint in equation  [ eq : piconstrt ] .",
    "furthermore , @xmath322 .",
    "the expression on the second line is the contribution of a kink in the geometry to the effective lagrangian and all the effort of integrating up the action and differentiating back has been designed to correctly pick up this contribution .",
    "we are now free to fix a gauge for @xmath46 and @xmath53 .",
    "a particularly convenient gauge is @xmath323 and @xmath324 which yields the following effective lagrangian : @xmath325 this equation is to be interpreted as @xmath326 where @xmath327 is the hamiltonian of the system and @xmath328 is the effective canonical momentum .",
    "in fact , it is convenient to subtract out the constant contribution of the background black hole to the hamiltonian to write the hamiltonian as @xmath329 . to get the effective lagrangian for",
    "multiple particles we need only add a similar @xmath330 term for each particle and pick the new adm mass as the hamiltonian .",
    "this has been done is section  [ sec : dress ] .",
    "in this appendix we will demonstrate that the quantities @xmath76 that determine the masses of the geometries in between the particles form a system of @xmath43 conserved quantities with mutually vanishing poisson brackets .",
    "this shows that the effective dynamics of the system is classically integrable so long as the particles do not cross each other . to show that @xmath331 we start with the observation that @xmath332 since @xmath333 is the global hamiltonian of the system .",
    "next , observe that equation  [ eq : can ] defining @xmath334 can be written as a definition of @xmath77 in terms of the dynamical of variables of the ith particle and @xmath76 : @xmath335 .",
    "let us take as the induction hypothesis that @xmath336 .",
    "we can write : @xmath337 we now compute the various partial and total derivatives required to evaluate this expression and plug back in .",
    "first of all note that equation  [ eq : can ] for the canonical momenta can be written in the form @xmath338 for a suitably chosen function @xmath339 . define the quantities : @xmath340 we can now differentiate both sides of the equation for @xmath341 to get : @xmath342 these expressions can be solved to find the partial derivatives in equation  [ eq : dmdt ] .",
    "finally , we want to compute @xmath343 and @xmath344 . since @xmath333 is the hamiltonian these are given by @xmath345 and @xmath346 where the partial derivatives are taken while holding all the other canonical pairs @xmath347 constant .",
    "we can use the chain of definitions of @xmath76 in terms of @xmath77 to compute these derivatives as : @xmath348 with @xmath122 defined as : @xmath349 putting these expressions back into equation  [ eq : dmdt ] we find that @xmath350 where we have used the induction hypothesis that @xmath336 that is satisfied for @xmath351 .",
    "having shown that the @xmath76 are conserved we show that they have mutually vanishing poisson brackets .",
    "the possion brackets are given by : @xmath352 where each partial derivative is evaluated while holding all other canonical variables constant .",
    "we can use the equations  [ eq : can ] for the canonical momenta as an implicit chain of definitions of @xmath76 in terms of @xmath77 : @xmath353 .",
    "this permits us to write @xmath354 .",
    "so consider @xmath355 for @xmath356 .",
    "because each @xmath76 is defined in terms of @xmath107 and @xmath357 for @xmath358 , this possion bracket is given by : @xmath359 .",
    "now define @xmath360 with @xmath361 . then @xmath362 and @xmath363 .",
    "this gives us the result that : @xmath364 = 0\\ ] ] this proves that the possion brackets of the @xmath76 vanish .",
    "we have seen that the @xmath76 form a set of @xmath43 mutually commuting quantities with vanishing possion brackets .",
    "this tells us that the system of @xmath43 gravitationally dressed particles is classically integrable so long as the particles do not cross .",
    "in this appendix we will solve the wkb self - consistency conditions in equation  [ eq : self ] in order to compute the one particle dressed wavefunctions .",
    "it is useful to define @xmath239 and @xmath240 as the following small quantities : @xmath365 in these equations @xmath239 measures the difference between the boundary of the trapped surfaces for self - interacting particles and the event horizon associated with the background black hole .",
    "the small quantity @xmath240 measures how far the initial position of the particle deviates from the boundary of the trapped surfaces . using the initial condition @xmath140 and the equation of motion  ( [ eq:1motion ] )",
    "the self - consistency conditions  ( [ eq : self ] ) can now be written as : @xmath366 \\label{eq : iter2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to solve these equations we have to specify the kinematical regimes that are of interest to us so that we can make suitable approximations .",
    "we are interested in observing the radiation at late times on @xmath202 .",
    "so we will take @xmath367 so that the observations are made far from the horizon of the black hole while @xmath368 is small .",
    "we will also assume that the outgoing state has an energy much smaller than @xmath66 , the energy of the black hole , because the semiclassical methods are not reliable for extremely energetic states .",
    "this choice of kinematical regime implies that both @xmath239 and @xmath240 are much smaller that @xmath369 .",
    "it is shown in section  [ sec : selfcorr ] that hawking radiation observed at a time @xmath11 arises from states with kruskal momenta that grow rapidly with time and this tells us that for the physics questions of interest to us we can drop the @xmath239 and the @xmath240 in the exponent of equation  [ eq : iter2 ] to leading order .",
    "having linearized the equations in this way we solve them to find that : @xmath370 in the equation for @xmath371 , the function @xmath339 is zero to leading order - we have included it merely to remind us that there are additional subleading dependencies that we have omitted .",
    "we are now ready to calculate the phase of the dressed wavefunction @xmath372 where @xmath373 is given in equation  [ eq : r ] .",
    "since we have only calculated @xmath239 and @xmath240 to leading order we should linearize @xmath53 in terms of these small quantities . keeping terms of order @xmath239 , @xmath240 , @xmath374 and @xmath375 , we substitute our solutions for these quantities to find : @xmath376 } { 1 + e^{-\\lambda t}(\\gamma -1)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as discussed earlier we expect @xmath339 to be small and from equation  [ eq : soln ] we see that if @xmath239 is assumed to be small then at late times on @xmath263 ( large @xmath12 with @xmath377 small ) @xmath378 must be small also .",
