    "<S> when incorporating the near - field contribution , we observe very good agreement between the theory and our simulations , including the trapping of the puller and the oscillations of the pusher ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : vel1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this result can be understood by noting that the far- and near - field contributions are qualitatively different . in the far - field , </S>",
    "<S> a pusher swims stably parallel to the wall , whereas a puller rotates until it is perpendicular to it  @xcite . in the near - field , it is the puller which swims stably along the wall , pointing slightly towards it  @xcite , whereas the pusher has no stable swimming solution . in our simulations , </S>",
    "<S> the particle is trapped close to the wall , so near - field hydrodynamics dominates , although far - field contributions are non - negligible .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite an analysis of the dynamics of approach to the surface , @xmath69  @xcite , leads to similar conclusions : prior to interacting with the repulsive wall , the far - field works well ; when the repulsive interaction is reached , there is a notable disagreement ( see si , fig . </S>",
    "<S> s2 ) .    for movement along the wall ( @xmath70 ) , the simulations and far field predictions agree reasonably well at all times ( fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : vel2](a ) ; similar conclusions were reached by spagnolie and lauga who studied the dynamics of a swimmer before collisions with the wall  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the steady state velocities for both swimmers are considerably larger than in the bulk , i.e. the presence of a surface accelerates the motion ( @xmath71% increase , see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : vel2](a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the increase in the swimming speed near a solid surface can be understood intuitively by considering the swimming mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> the pusher is propelled from behind , thus when pointing away from the surface it is pushing the fluid flow against a solid wall  </S>",
    "<S> this should enhance the swim speed , as predicted for swimmers in porous media  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the speed increase is retained for the periodic swimming . </S>",
    "<S> the speedup of the puller can be understood in a similar way : the squirmer is now oriented towards the wall so by pulling inward along its swimming axis , it pulls itself along the wall . </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments reported an enhanced swimming speed up to @xmath72 for janus colloids on a water - air interface  @xcite .     for a pusher ( @xmath73 ) ; simulations ( solid line ) and far field predictions ( dot - dashed line ) and puller ( @xmath74 ) ; simulations ( dotted line ) and far field prediction ( dashed line ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath75 ; initial conditions : @xmath40 , @xmath52 ; no thermal noise ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) time averaged @xmath76 as a function of the repulsion range @xmath21 , from simulations ( open symbols ) and far field calculations ( closed symbols ) , for both pushers ( squares and upward triangles ) and pullers ( circles and downward triangles ) . </S>",
    "<S> initial conditions : @xmath40 , @xmath77 ; @xmath38 . ]    increasing the range of the repulsive interaction leaves the pusher dynamics along the surface mostly unaffected : we find that @xmath78 for all the interaction ranges considered , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : vel2](a , b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the case of the puller is very different , as any repulsive interaction extending past the equilibrium swimming distance @xmath79 leads to hydrodynamic torques orienting the particle towards the wall ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : gapangle1](d ) ) ; see also si , fig . </S>",
    "<S> s3 , which shows that the far - field approximation for the tangential speed remains good in this case as well ) . </S>",
    "<S> the reorientation occurs independently of initial conditions ( in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : vel2](b ) the initial angle is almost tangential , @xmath66 ) , and leads to a dramatic slowing down of the particle , whose motion virtually comes to a standstill when @xmath56 ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : vel2](b ) ) . in all the cases we have considered </S>",
    "<S> , the rotational motion has a fundamental role in the dynamics of the particle , and this is affected by @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the soft repulsion only slows down the particle movement along the surface normal ( as visible from si , fig . </S>",
    "<S> s2 for @xmath69 ) , and it _ does not _ create any torques ; therefore any rotational motion of the particle only arises from the combination of hydrodynamic and brownian forces .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusions : _ we have presented a study of fully resolved spherical squirmers swimming between two solid walls , using a microscopic model which prescribes a slip velocity at the particle surface . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that repulsive interactions , which have been neglected in previous theories of swimmers interacting with surfaces , play a very important role in the squirmer s dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> first , they can stabilise hydrodynamic oscillations of a pusher close to the wall . </S>",
    "<S> a recent systematic investigation has demonstrated that in the parameter range we consider ( @xmath80 or below ) there is no stable bound state with the pusher swimming near the wall  @xcite . while experiments routinely observe that bacteria ( which are known to be pushers ) or phoretic swimmers ( which are thought to be pushers ) are attracted to and swim near flat surfaces  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one way to reconcile these results is if the trajectory of the swimmer at late times is oscillatory ( a limit cycle in the @xmath81 plane ) instead of having constant velocity ( a stationary point in the @xmath81 plane ) . </S>",
    "<S> while this conclusion should hold qualitatively for several different pusher swimmers , we note that a spherical squirmer model does not provide a quantitatively accurate description of a rod - like bacterial swimmer such as _ e.coli_ , so that the details of its hydrodynamic oscillations may in practice differ from those presented here .    </S>",
    "<S> second , we find that the swim velocity of a pusher is much increased with respect to the bulk limit : this behaviour can be understood as the particle , on average , is directed away from the wall and pushes on it , enhancing its speed . </S>",
    "<S> third , we find that the tangential velocity of a puller slows down dramatically with the range of the repulsive interaction with the wall . </S>",
    "<S> our results critically require near - field hydrodynamics , as the far - field approximation poorly captures the rotational dynamics we observe .    </S>",
    "<S> our findings further imply that the existence and extent of steric or electrostatic repulsion of the wall could be tuned to control properties such as the number density and speed of active particles near a surface . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally this could be achieved , by varying either the buffer concentration ( for electrostatic repulsion ) or the polymer coverage of the surface ( for steric repulsion ) . </S>",
    "<S> these predictions should be testable with experiments using bacterial swimmers or artificial microswimmers , although for phoretic particles one may need to first estimate the effect of chemical gradients , here neglected , on the dynamics  @xcite .    </S>",
