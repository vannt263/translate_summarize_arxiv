    "the use of standard rods  distance scales with no evolution in linear size over the lifetime of the universe  to carry out geometric tests of cosmological models was first proposed by hoyle ( 1959 ) , but the application of this idea to real data took a long time , specifically because of the difficulty in finding suitable objects or structures for this purpose .",
    "the earliest tests of cosmological models using the observed dependence of the angular size of galaxies or kpc - scale radio sources could not easily define a true metric rod and were subject to unknown evolutionary effects ( e.g. , sandage 1988 ) .",
    "there was uncertainty about whether the observed size - redshift relation in radio galaxies was an indication of an actual evolution in size ( kapahi 1987 ; barthel & miley 1988 ; neeser et al .",
    "1995 ) , or whether it was due to selection effects ( singal 1998 ; nilsson et al .",
    "this was partially addressed in a subsequent study using an enlarged sample of double - lobed quasars at @xmath16 ( buchalter et al .",
    "1998 ) , which showed no change in apparent angular size within the range @xmath17 , consistent with standard cosmology without significant evolution .",
    "separate investigations specifically to study the cosmic deceleration ( or acceleration ) were carried out by gurvits ( 1993 , 1994 ) ( using vlbi visibility data obtained at 13 cm by preston et al .",
    "this analysis also provided estimates of the dependence of the apparent angular size of compact sources on their luminosity and rest - frame frequency .",
    "similar studies were also carried out by kellermann ( 1993 ) and wilkinson et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . within a few years ,",
    "a much enlarged sample of 330 compact radio sources distributed over a broad range of redshifts @xmath18 started to demonstrate that the angular size - redshift relation for compact radio sources is consistent with the predictions of standard friedmann - robertson - walker models without the need to consider evolutionary or selection effects ( gurvits et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "other groups carried out their own cosmological tests using powerful radio - lobed radio galaxies , presumed to be reasonable standard yardsticks to determine global cosmological parameters ( daly 1994 , 1995 ) .",
    "the method was applied and discussed by guerra & daly ( 1996 , 1998 ) , guerra ( 1997 ) , and daly , guerra & wan ( 1998 , 2000 ) , who reported that the data at that time strongly favoured a low ( matter ) density universe .",
    "vishwakarma ( 2001 ) and lima & alcaniz ( 2002 ) used the gurvits et al .",
    "( 1999 ) compact radio source angular size versus redshift data to set constraints on cosmological parameters .",
    "this analysis was extended by chen & ratra ( 2003 ) , who used these data to place constraints on cosmological model parameters for a variety of cosmological constant scenarios . and a more focused study using friib radio galaxy redshift - angular size data to derive constraints on the parameters of a spatially - flat cosmology with a dark - energy scalar field was carried out by podariu et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "more recently , in one of the better known studies using this method , based on the average linear size of galaxies with the same luminosity ( see , e.g. , mcintosh et al . 2005 ; barden et al . 2005 ; trujillo et al .",
    "2006 ; lpez - corredoira 2010 ) , the measurements do not appear to be consistent with an expanding cosmology , unless galaxies have grown in size by a surprisingly large factor six from redshift @xmath19 to @xmath20 .",
    "perhaps the cosmology itself is wrong or , more simply , there is still some ambiguity concerning the use of galactic size as a standard rod . indeed ,",
    "if another more reliable scale could be found , and shown to be consistent with , say , the standard model ( @xmath0cdm ) , the contrast between this result , and the disparity emerging through the use of galaxies , could be useful in affirming the need for stronger evolution in galactic growth than is predicted by current theory .",
    "our focus in this paper will be galaxy clusters , which can also be used as standard rulers under appropriate conditions .",
    "these are the largest gravitationally collapsed structures in the universe , with a hot diffuse plasma ( @xmath21 k ) filling the intergalactic medium . their angular size versus redshift can be measured using a combination of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) and x - ray surface brightness observations .",
    "the sunyaev - zeldovich effect is the result of high - energy electrons distorting the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) through inverse compton scattering , during which low - energy cmb photons ( on average ) receive an energy boost from the high - energy electrons in the cluster ( sunyaev & zeldovich 1970 , 1972 ) .",
    "the same hot gas emits x - rays primarily via thermal bremsstrahlung . while the sze is a function of the integrated pressure , @xmath22 ( in terms of the electron number density @xmath23 and temperature @xmath24 ) along the line - of - sight , the x - ray emission scales as @xmath25 ( in terms of the cooling function @xmath26 ) .",
    "this different dependence on density , along with a suitable model for the cluster gas , enables a direct distance determination to the galaxy cluster .",
    "this method is independent of the extragalactic distance ladder and provides distances to high - redshift galaxy clusters .",
    "sze / x - ray distances have been previously used to constrain some cosmological parameters and to test the distance duality relationship of metric gravity models ( see , e.g. , de bernardis et al . 2006 ; lima et al .",

    ", we will use these data , not to further examine the distance duality relation per se but , rather , to address two related issues .",
    "first , we will use the newer and larger sample of galaxy - cluster angular size versus redshift measurements from bonamante et al .",
    "( 2006 ) to constrain cosmological models .",
    "in particular , we wish to see if the aforementioned tension between galaxy growth and the conventional expansion scenario is supported by the cluster data , or whether the latter confirm the basic theoretical predictions , thus reinforcing the need for a stronger galactic evolution at high redshifts .",
    "second , we wish to use this relatively new probe of the universe s expansion to directly test the @xmath1 universe ( melia 2007 ; melia & shevchuk 2012 ) against the data and to see how its predictions compare with those of @xmath0cdm .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in   2 , we will briefly summarize the galaxy - cluster angular - size sample at our disposal .",
    "we will present theoretical fits to the data in   3 , and constrain the cosmological parameters  both in the context of @xmath0cdm and the @xmath1 universe  in ",
    "we will end with a discussion and conclusion in   5 .",
    "in addition to the luminosity distance , @xmath27 , which is necessary for measurements involving standard candles such as type ia sne , the angular - diameter distance ( add ) , @xmath28 , is also used in astronomy for objects whose diameter ( i.e. , the standard ruler ) is known . the luminosity distance and add can be measured independently using different celestial objects , but they are related via etherington s reciprocity relation : @xmath29 this relation , sometimes referred as the distance - duality ( dd ) relation , is completely general and is valid for all cosmological models based on riemannian geometry .",
    "that is , its validity is independent of einstein s field equations for gravity and the nature of the matter - energy content of the universe .",
    "it requires only that the source and observer be connected via null geodesics in a riemannian spacetime and that the number of photons be conserved .",
    "x - ray observations of the intra - cluster medium , combined with radio observations of the galaxy cluster s sunyaev - zeldovich effect , allow an estimate of the add to be made . recently ,",

    "in other words , though @xmath72 in @xmath0cdm can not be equal to @xmath71 from one moment to the next , its value averaged over the age of the universe is equal to what it would have been in @xmath1 .    in terms of the expansion dynamics , @xmath0cdm must guess the constituents of the universe and their individual equations of state , and then predict the expansion rate as a function of time .",
    "in contrast , @xmath1 acknowledges the fact that no matter what these constituents are , the total energy density in the universe gives rise to a gravitational horizon coincident with the better known hubble radius .",

    ", the difference in outcome using model selection tools is therefore almost entirely due to the fact that @xmath1 has fewer parameters than the standard model .    with this result",
    ", we can now address the second goal of our paper  to provide some evidence in support of , or against , the strong evolution in galaxy size implied by earlier studies assuming @xmath0cdm .",
    "the analysis of the average linear size of galaxies with the same luminosity , though over a range of redshifts ( see , e.g. , mcintosh et al . 2005 ; barden et al .",
    "2005 ; trujillo et al .",
    "2006 ) , had indicated that the standard model is consistent with these data only if these galaxies were @xmath13 times smaller at @xmath19 than at @xmath20 .",
    "lopz - corredoira ( 2010 ) reconsidered this question , pointing out that current ideas invoked to explain this effect probably can not adequately account for all of the deficit of large objects at high redshifts .",
    "for example , the main argument in favour of the evolution in size for a fixed luminosity is that younger galaxies tend to be brighter , and we should expect to see younger galaxies at high redshift .",
    "therefore , for a given luminosity corresponding to some radius at present , galaxies in the past could have produced the same luminosity with a smaller radius .",
    "lopz - corredoira estimates that this effect can contribute a factor @xmath147 difference in size , depending on whether one is looking at elliptical or disk galaxies .",
    "other factors contributing to the evolution in size include mergers , and observational selection effects , such as extinction .",
    "it appears that none of these explanations , on their own , can account for the required overall growth .",
    "however , our use of galaxy clusters in this paper has shown that the cluster add data are quite consistent with both @xmath0cdm and @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the fact that both of these models provide an excellent explanation for the add measurements using clusters casts some doubt on the suggestion that the inferred galaxy - size evolution is due to the adoption of an incorrect cosmology , rather than effects such as those discussed above .",
    "if it turns out that the combination of growth factors together can not account for the factor six difference in size between @xmath19 and @xmath20 , we would conclude that some other astrophysical reasons are responsible , rather than the adoption of an incorrect expansion scenario .    in conclusion",
    ", even though the current galaxy - cluster angular size versus redshift data are still somewhat limited by relatively large uncertainties , we have demonstrated that they can nonetheless already be used to carry out meaningful one - on - one comparisons between competing cosmologies .",
    "the add measurements for these structures appear to be consistent with both @xmath0cdm and the @xmath1 universe , suggesting that the inconsistent results obtained with similar work using individual galaxy sizes are probably not an indication of gross deficiencies with the assumed cosmological model .",
