    "to understand the broad interest in non - light flavors in hadronic collisions , one only has to appreciate two basic facts : 1 ) strangeness and charm are degrees of freedom which are not present in the initial colliding systems ( predominantly composed of up and down quarks ) and 2 ) the successively larger quark masses require larger momentum transfers in their production processes , thus making the use of pqcd techniques more reasonable as the strong coupling constant decreases .",
    "these features make heavy flavor an interesting probe of the early stages of heavy ion collisions , possibly sensitive to the features of the produced , strongly - interacting medium .",
    "to even begin to address the issue of heavy flavor production in heavy ion collisions , one must understand the essential features of the production process in elementary collisions , including @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 reactions . since the discovery of the @xmath3 ( closed charm ) in 1974  @xcite and the subsequent discovery of d mesons ( open charm ) a year later",
    ", a large data set on charmed hadrons has been built up over a variety of collision energies and reactions . only a small subset relevant to later arguments will be discussed here .",
    "the apparently simple reaction of electron - positron annihilating to a virtual photon and subsequently into hadrons ( @xmath4 ) is an excellent laboratory to study both the production of heavy quarks from the qcd vacuum as well as the cleanest environment to study their fragmentation into hadrons .",
    "it provided the cleanest environment to discover the @xmath3 and to measure its properties , as well as the means to produce the higher - mass and higher - spin states of the `` charmonium '' spectrum , whose striking similarity to the already - known positronium level diagram was one of the early great successes of the quark model of hadrons  @xcite .",
    "the fragmentation of heavy quarks is an active field of research in recent years .",
    "this is a consequence of the recent turn - on of b - factories at kek and slac , as well as recent analyses of production at the @xmath5 pole with extensive particle identification .",
    "one striking feature of heavy quark fragmentation which distinguishes it from light - quark fragmentation the distinctive `` hard '' fragmentation functions , with the leading particle taking typically 60% of the initial quark energy for charm ( at b - factory energies ) , and nearly 80% for beauty",
    "( at lep energies )  @xcite .",
    "when studied as a function of particle species in b and c jets , one finds a striking example of the `` leading particle effect '' , where kaons appear to carry the memory of the initial heavy quark ( clearly by virtue of the cascading weak decays of the heavy quarks @xmath6 )  @xcite .",
    "one also sees a dramatic depletion of all particles in the forward direction , a direct indication of the so - called `` dead - cone '' effect  @xcite .",
    "both of these effects ( hard fragmentation and dead - cone ) will be relevant for later discussions of heavy quark production in heavy ion collisions .     , width=226 ]     , width=340 ]    as a preparation for future discussions of @xmath3 production , it is important to discuss the level of our understanding of how such particles are formed from heavy quarks .",
    "originally it was thought that a charm and anti - charm quark were produced simultaneously via @xmath7 or @xmath8 scattering and then the pair would `` coalesce '' into a color singlet @xmath3 - the `` color singlet model '' ( csm )  @xcite .",
    "however , it turned out that this model in conjunction with pqcd production estimates dramatically under - predicted the rates in @xmath1 collisions ( to be discussed below ) .",
    "this led to the `` color octet model '' ( com )  @xcite which attributed @xmath3 production to the correlated production of a @xmath9 precursor state already close in phase space , color neutralized by an available soft gluon . by reducing the difficulty of situating the produced quarks near enough in phase space , the com predicted much larger production rates .",
    "a similar model is the `` color evaporation model '' ( cem )  @xcite , which predicts that a @xmath3 is dominantly produced via gluon fragmentation , presuming that one can always find a soft gluon .",
    "this model also predicts simple formulas for @xmath10 .    in this context , one can appreciate the puzzle in @xmath3 production found recently in belle data  @xcite .",
    "they found a striking correlation in the production of @xmath3 with other charmed particles .",
    "the fraction @xmath11 is a striking challenge for both singlet and octet models of @xmath3 production .",
    "neither would predict that a charm pair , which should normally hadronize into jets with leading d mesons , would prefer to emit _ another _ charm pair .",
    "however , it is the opinion of this author ( perhaps unoriginally ) that this large ratio may simply be a sort of `` trigger bias '' .",
    "since a decay of a virtual photon into oppositely pointing @xmath12 and @xmath13 jets would preclude these quarks from creating a bound state , it seems unlikely to ever produce a @xmath3 without the liberation of yet another pair of quarks . in this context",
    ", it may be difficult to produce a @xmath3 without additional charm production , but this heuristic argument ( which is ultimately based on quark counting ) does not have any substantial theoretical underpinning at present .      in @xmath14 collisions ,",
    "the dominant charm production process is the scattering of quarks and gluons in the initial - state parton structure of the projectiles .",
    "charm production in @xmath15 and @xmath16 collisions thus offers a means to explore a large range of kinematic variables ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) at the cost of needing to introduce substantial phenomenological input to interpret the data .",
    "that is , at the same time as one is testing the utility of the fundamental pqcd cross sections , one is also testing our understanding of non - perturbative structure and fragmentation functions .    as the most basic example of the concept of `` collinear factorization ''",
    ", one can examine a typical expression of the total charm cross section in its factorized form ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite :    @xmath19    this formula shows how one factorizes out the initial state of the projectiles from the fundamental pqcd production cross section , constraining the kinematics with the delta function . the `` projectile '' and `` target '' are incorporated separately via their own structure functions and the respective momentum fractions sampled from each ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) .",
    "the `` k - factor '' is required to match the overall normalization , which is often underestimated by fixed - order calculations , but is expected to be unnecessary if all orders could be included .",
    "results from these calculations are shown for p+p collisions in fig .",
    "[ vogt - ccbb ] .    to extract single - particle spectra",
    ", one must convolute the terms which describe the production of charm quarks with the fragmentation functions we have already discussed in the context of @xmath0 annihilations to charm or bottom quarks .",
    "@xmath22    here we see how particle spectra result from 3 independent steps : 1 ) production controlled by the initial nucleon or nuclear structure , 2 ) pqcd cross sections , 3 ) fragmentation of the produced partons .",
    "it should be noted that the scale dependence of the cross sections and fragmentation functions are themselves typically controlled by dglap qcd evolution , which provides for additional low - x gluons as the energy increases .",
    "this breaks the initially - proposed feynman scaling and leads to the production of very soft gluons near @xmath23 .",
    "it should also be noted that experimental transverse momentum spectra are much softer than the theoretical predictions . to account for this",
    ", one typically adds a phenomenological `` @xmath24-broadening '' , shown as @xmath25 , which harden the spectrum and increase the cross section .",
    "the same does not appear to be needed in the longitudinal distributions at fixed target energies , which is a real puzzle at present  @xcite .",
    "it should be emphasized in this context that qcd `` factorization '' , in the formal sense established by collins , soper , and sterman @xcite , is critical concept for the application of pqcd to hadronic and heavy ion collisions .",
    "it is only officially a well - defined concept for very large momentum transfers , such that @xmath26 . in this regime ,",
    "the momentum transfers take place over small space - time distances and one may prove that in certain conditions ( e.g. drell - yan production ) that the `` hard '' pqcd cross sections are independent of the long - wavelength fluctuations in the proton wave function .",
    "this is thus a prerequisite for any kind of nucleon or nuclear structure physics , although it is also critical that the structure functions are `` universal '' and independent of which pqcd subprocess one is considering .",
    "finally , if all this is true , then hard processes in @xmath16 and @xmath27 collisions become comprehensible as a superposition of the independent binary collisions given the initial impact parameter .       , width=453 ]    it is generally understood , by means of the qcd factorization theorems , that hadron - hadron interactions at asymptotically high energies should be amenable to a perturbative qcd description , especially for processes involving large momentum transfers .",
    "historically , this expectation has been well established for high-@xmath28 jet rates but typically confounded for open heavy flavor and quarkonium production at the highest - available energies at the fermilab tevatron ( @xmath29 tev ) .",
    "open charm at cdf has only recently come under reasonable theoretical control .",
    "the data shown in fig .  [ diffxsection_combined_4x1 ] on d meson production  @xcite is compared with nlo calculations , and one finds that the data sit on the upper edge of the theoretical systematic error bands ( shown in gray ) .",
    "these are the errors generated by varying the factorization and renormalization scales ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) up and down by a factor of two .",
    "thus , one is finding a consistency between data and theory of about 50 - 100% , which is certainly not in the realm of precision physics yet , but nlo calculations of heavy flavor production are maturing rapidly , so more improvements should be expected .    the situation with @xmath3 production has been steadily improving since the realization in the early 1990 s that pqcd calculations joined with the csm under - predicted the measured @xmath3 production rates at very high @xmath32 ( 6 - 20 gev / c ) by enormous factors ( 1 - 2 orders of magnitude)@xcite .",
    "the introduction of the com improved the agreement in rates , but predicted a polarization which has been strongly contradicted by recent tevatron data@xcite .    the main point to draw from these discussions",
    "is that even in the highest energy elementary collisions , heavy flavor production is not trivial .",
    "this situation should be kept in mind when applying similar calculations to lower - energy heavy ion collisions , where the momentum transfers are smaller , and the collision systems are substantially more complicated .",
    "evolution . [ rgdist ] , width=340 ]",
    "given the current understanding of heavy flavor production in high - energy collisions , it would seem difficult to get a handle on the nature of similar production processes in the more complicated environment of a heavy ion collision . to this end",
    ", studies of proton collisions on nuclei are used to get a potentially more relevant baseline for a+a collisions .",
    "one of the complications of studying flavor production in a nuclear environment is the nucleus itself .",
    "deep - inelastic experiments in the early 1980 s revealed that the effective structure of a nucleon embedded in a nucleus ( expressed as ratios such as @xmath33 ) were substantially modified relative to the nucleon structure .",
    "while only a modest dependence on @xmath18 , the hardness scale of the scattering process , was observed@xcite , a dramatic dependence was found in the @xmath17 variable , representing the momentum fraction of the partons struck by the incoming virtual photon . at the highest @xmath17 range ( @xmath34 ) , one observes a large enhancement due to fermi smearing of the nucleons in the nucleus . at moderate @xmath17 ( @xmath35 one finds a depletion of the parton distributions , a phenomenon called the `` emc effect''@xcite but which continues to resist simple explanation even now . to maintain energy - momentum conservation ,",
    "the strong depletion in moderate @xmath17 partons must be compensated by a rise in @xmath17 values of approximately @xmath36 , called the `` enhancement '' or `` anti - shadowing '' region .",
    "finally , the region of very low @xmath17 ( @xmath37 ) shows `` shadowing '' phenomenon , characterized by a depletion nearly flat down to very low @xmath17 values .    while no unique explanation of this effect exists ,",
    "it is generally thought to arise by the quantum - mechanical interference of the wave functions of the nucleons in the nucleus , which make up the tube in front of the incoming virtual photon ( or equivalently @xmath38 state)@xcite .    by treating nuclear effects as modifications of the initial state , rather than as a dynamical effect of the collision of the probe with the nucleus",
    ", the physics of nuclear modifications is generally considered to not be in the realm of perturbative qcd .",
    "thus , `` nuclear shadowing '' a term which encompasses all of the above effects and denotes any modification of the structure function of a nucleon in a nucleus , is generally handled by a judicious parametrization of existing data , using known pqcd techniques to evolve the modification factors as a function of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "this is the basis of the well - known eks98 approach .",
    "they take the modification factors @xmath39 for parton @xmath40 and evolve using dglap techniques@xcite . these lead to a set of curves shown in fig .",
    "[ rgdist ] , from ref .",
    "@xcite , which clearly show the `` shadowing '' , `` anti - shadowing '' , `` emc effect '' and `` fermi motion '' regimes , but now as a function of @xmath18 from @xmath41 to @xmath42 .",
    "it should not be forgotten , however , that saturation models do offer a qcd - based model for shadowing phenomenon with some basis in perturbative qcd .      as we showed in above sections ,",
    "heavy flavor is not fully under control even in elementary reactions .",
    "open charm is still under - predicted by pqcd calculations , requiring substantial @xmath43 factors to agree with data .",
    "even then , special fragmentation functions and intrinsic @xmath24 are needed to describe the differential cross sections .",
    "closed charm is plagued by its reliance on nrqcd models of @xmath3 formation .",
    "how could we then expect to use it as a `` calibrated '' probe in a heavy ion collision ?",
    "the answer again relies on qcd factorization : in principle the short - wavelength field configurations reflected in large transverse momentum processes are only moderately sensitive to the longer - range configurations typical of soft processes .",
    "this leads to the prediction that high-@xmath32 phenomena , including charm production rates , are only sensitive to the number of binary collisions experienced by the nucleons as the nuclei interpenetrate each other . to be more specific , one would expect the rate of these rare processes to scale _ linearly _ with the number of binary collisions , essentially measuring the longitudinal thickness of the projectile and target nuclei seen by the incoming nucleons .",
    "given this , strong deviations from factorization expectations can then be interpreted a indications of non - trivial nuclear physics .",
    "@xmath3 suppression is the canonical example of this story@xcite .    just as a reminder",
    ", we briefly review the two dominant scaling variables for yields in heavy ion collisions .",
    "soft particle production in @xmath16 and @xmath27 collisions has been observed to scale linearly with the number of `` participating '' nucleons ( @xmath44 ) , i.e. nucleons which undergo any inelastic process .",
    "hard processes , by contrast , are expected to scale with the number of `` binary collisions '' , as mentioned in the previous paragraph .",
    "these two quantities are tightly correlated by the fact that at smaller impact parameter ( @xmath45 ) , a typical nucleon sees a larger thickness , so the larger the overlap volume , the greater the thickness of nuclear matter it collides with , giving an approximate number of collisions that scales as volume@xmath46thickness @xmath47 .",
    "glauber calculations show that over the range of impact parameters measured by rhic experiments , one is sampling thicknesses of @xmath48 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ glauber_200_ncnp_npnc ] .",
    "production drell - yan as a function of centrality .",
    "[ tmundo_preto ] , width=340 ]     production drell - yan as a function of centrality .",
    "[ tmundo_preto ] , width=226 ]    the na50 analysis of @xmath3 suppression is generally shown as the ratio of @xmath3 production relative to drell - yan production a function of a centrality variable ( typically @xmath28)@xcite . this ratio is then compared with a calculation of the expected `` normal nuclear suppression '' extracted from p+a data , as shown in fig .",
    "[ tmundo_preto ] .",
    "the data appear to agree with the normal suppression in peripheral events , but then deviate strongly for moderately peripheral events saturating at a suppression factor of approximately 50% .",
    "these results are insensitive to various choices of the centrality variable ( i.e. a rescaling of the horizontal axis )  @xcite , which is not surprising considering that these ratios are made within each centrality class .",
    "while these results have been cited widely and studied by a variety of theoretical approaches , it makes sense to look very carefully at the systematics of @xmath3 production from other systems and energies , by which `` normal '' nuclear suppression is determined .",
    "the analysis of this suppression is based on the fact that the yield of @xmath3 per target nucleon tends to systematically decrease as a function of nuclear thickness .",
    "this is typically interpreted as the absorption of produced @xmath3 in the nucleus itself , presumably by @xmath49 inelastic scattering  @xcite .",
    "this absorption is described empirically by the parameter @xmath50 , which is made from a fit of the yields to the form @xmath51 , with @xmath52 ideally the @xmath14 cross section ( but not necessarily so ) . if @xmath53 then every nucleon in the nucleus is visible to the incoming proton , which is equivalent to @xmath54-scaling .",
    "we interpret @xmath55 as due to the shadowing of the interior by the nucleons on the surface , i.e. @xmath56 corresponds to complete surface absorption , with even lower values interpreted as further absorption in the bulk .",
    "na50 extracted values of @xmath57 @xcite . implying a substantial absorption in heavy targets .",
    "they also analyze these results in terms of an attenuation in the effective thickness of the nuclear target ( which is approximately @xmath58 ) , @xmath59 and using glauber geometry as a function of centrality to determine @xmath60 in order to estimate @xmath61 .",
    "this cross section was as large as @xmath62 mb in the 1996 analysis , but has decreased to @xmath63 mb in a recent analysis incorporating the s+u data@xcite .",
    "thus , this cross section appears to depend strongly on the fit assumptions , lending some doubt to its status as representing a primordial physics process .     as a function of @xmath64 .",
    "[ alpha_xf ] , height=264 ]     as a function of @xmath64 .",
    "[ alpha_xf ] , height=264 ]    some insight on this can be gained by study of other important @xmath3 data sets from phenix at rhic and e866 at fermilab .",
    "these experiments have larger kinematic acceptance than na50 , e866 with the full forward range @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) in p+a collisions and phenix with forward and backward coverage @xmath67 in d+au collisions , in order to elucidate the role of shadowing and energy loss in @xmath3 production .",
    "if the depletion of @xmath3 as a function of nuclear thickness was simply due to the shadowing of the parton densities in the nuclear target , then the suppression factor would be simply due to the nuclear properties and thus @xmath50 would be a universal function of @xmath21 , the momentum fraction of the target parton , invariant with beam energy . as shown in fig .",
    "[ alpha_x2 ] , this expectation is dramatically violated when one compares na3 ,",
    "e866 and phenix ( something already noted previously by e866  @xcite comparing to na3 data from cern ) .",
    "this violation of @xmath21 scaling should be contrasted with scaling which _ is _ observed in the forward region between phenix , e866 and na3 over a broad range in @xmath64 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ alpha_xf ]  @xcite .",
    "while this would seem to be merely fortuitous , it should not be forgotten that inclusive charged particle production also seems to scale with @xmath64 across a wide range of beam energies .",
    "this is seen in the phenomenon of `` limiting fragmentation '' , where particle yields seem to scale when plotted as a function of @xmath68  @xcite .",
    "thus , it seems that @xmath3 s also obey a sort of limiting fragmentation , similar to soft processes , despite their presumed status as a hard probe .     , width=340 ]     , width=226 ]    other @xmath3 data suggests that this is not the case , at least for @xmath3 .",
    "phobos data has also shown that the yield inclusive charged particles ( @xmath69 ) scale approximately linearly with @xmath44 in d+au and au+au , but only when one integrates the yield over the full phase space@xcite .",
    "in limited regions , this linear scaling is clearly broken .",
    "in fact , in the forward region of d+au collisions , increasing the number of participants strongly suppresses the yield in the forward direction .",
    "this is compensated by an increase in yield in the backward direction , holding the total yield per participant constant @xcite .",
    "similar `` long range '' correlations of particle yields with centrality are also seen in phenix , where they calculate @xmath70 ( the ratio of yields in central and peripheral events , normalized by the number of binary collisions ) for @xmath3 as well as stopped hadrons in the muon system , which have @xmath71 , as shown in fig .  [ brahms_phenix_rcpjpsi ]  @xcite .",
    "it appears again that @xmath3 production acts very similarly to soft particles , at least away from mid - rapidity .",
    "this compensation of suppression in the forward region with enhancement in the backward direction may lead to an approximate constancy of total @xmath3 production with @xmath44 or @xmath54 in d+au collisions .",
    "taken together with the various claims made by gazdzicki et al  @xcite and braun - munzinger et al @xcite who argued that @xmath3 production actually shows approximate @xmath44-scaling , suppression measurements in a+a collisions may be substantially distorted by limited kinematic acceptance .",
    "if in fact @xmath44 scaling is relevant for @xmath3 production in a+a collisions , this may signal a mechanism better described by statistic models than by parton model calculations .",
    "of course , interpreting @xmath3 production statistically opens up the possibility of charm recombination , especially at rhic when the charm yields per events are quite large compared with sps energies  @xcite .",
    "the current phenix data  @xcite has very large error bars , and so it is somewhat premature to rule out recombination scenarios . the run 4 data with 10x the statistics should allow more definitive statements to be made .",

    "once the quantum numbers have been liberated in the initial state , they only decay via weak processes on time scales much longer than the lifetime of the system .",
    "thus , open charm may well serve the same purpose as drell - yan production and act as a proper reference for the modification of hard processes , especially if it is found to scale with the number of binary collisions .",
    "the high-@xmath32 suppression seen for light hadrons is not expected to show up in the spectrum of hadrons with heavy quarks ( d and b mesons ) due to the `` dead cone '' effect discussed above  @xcite    open charm has been measured both by phenix and star , by a variety of techniques .",

    "in conclusion , we have reviewed various aspects of heavy flavor production in heavy ion collisions in the context of elementary collisions .",
    "the interplay between theory in experiment in @xmath0 and @xmath1 data has been discussed and it is found that the pqcd description is not straightforward even now , although substantial progress is being made with nlo calculations .",
    "quarkonium suppression in p+a and a+a show some very puzzling features , if the primordial charm quarks are truly produced by factorisable hard processes .",
    "it is mysterious how @xmath3 production shares features with `` soft '' inclusive particle production .",
    "it is equally mysterious how open strangeness also scales much faster than @xmath44 , an effect which should not be entirely ignored when considering the @xmath54-scaling of open charm .",
    "it is evident that heavy ions , by offering an environment where nucleons are struck multiple times ( unlike elementary collisions ) , provide a unique perspective on the production of new flavor quantum numbers over a wide range of momentum scales .",
    "so while the present occasionally seems `` strange '' , although often `` charming '' , the future of heavy flavor studies at rhic certainly looks `` beautiful '' , with upgrades and planned searches for the @xmath90 and leptons from @xmath91 decay in the large statistics data sets taken in rhic run 4@xcite .",
    "the author would like to thank the organizers , federico antinori , steffen bass , rene bellwied , thomas ullrich , julia velkovska and urs wiedemann , who invited a non - expert sight - unseen to give a non - traditional talk on this subject .",
    "invaluable help was given by david silvermyr and raphael de cassagnac , who supplied me with preliminary phenix results .",
    "special thanks to ralf averbeck , terry awes , mark baker , jean cleymans , and paul stankus for discussions related to this work .",
