    "<S> we report that in cylindrical nanorods skyrmion chains , i.e. , three - dimensional spin textures , emerge dynamically , as revealed by micromagnetic simulations . </S>",
    "<S> the skyrmion - chain state occurs when the diameter of the rod is larger than the helical pitch length of the material , and the number of skyrmions on the chain is proportional to the length of the nanorod . </S>",
    "<S> this finding provides a deeper understanding of the interplay between geometry and skyrmionic symmetry , and shows how spatial confinement can stabilize spontaneous topological spin textures .    </S>",
    "<S> competition between the symmetric exchange interaction , the antisymmetric dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction ( dmi ) @xcite , and uniaxial crystalline anisotropy gives rise to the formation of complex spin textures in magnetic materials . </S>",
    "<S> in bulk magnets the dmi contributions typically cancel out , but non - zero net contributions emerge in low - symmetry systems , such as on surfaces and steps @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a fascinating manifestation of the competition between symmetric and antisymmetric interactions is the occurrence of skyrmions and skyrmion lattices @xcite , as observed e.g. in epitaxial fege(111 ) films @xcite and ultrathin fe / ir films @xcite with strong perpendicular anisotropy at zero field , and more recently in ultrathin co / pt nanostructures at room temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the stability of skyrmionic states is therefore contingent upon a symmetry - breaking field , either external or internal @xcite , which can also be set by the geometry of a solid , i.e. , the confinement of the spin structure in a low - symmetry system @xcite . on surfaces of bulk crystals skyrmions exist in a narrow temperature@xmath0field range , close to the curie temperature @xcite , but in thin films the skyrmion phase extends to wider temperature- and field - ranges @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the confinement of spin textures in nanostructures is therefore a key element for the stability of these states .    </S>",
    "<S> the intense research on skyrmions is fueled on the one hand by the fascination of the new physics related to these complex spin structures , and on the other hand by the potential to develop new technology for data - storage devices . </S>",
    "<S> this is motivated by the fact that skyrmions can be moved by relatively low current densities @xcite , promising energy - efficient spintronics , and because skyrmion - based devices can be coupled to conventional domain - wall - based devices by adjusting the geometry of the solid @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the confinement of skyrmionic spin textures in nano - structures is a key element in creating and controlling them , and as we will discuss in this letter , the geometry of nanostructures can give rise to complex spontaneous spin textures . using high - resolution micromagnetic finite - difference simulations for the structure of fege </S>",
    "<S> we will show that in cylindrical nanorods three - dimensional metastable topological spin textures emerge , which exhibit a one - dimensional oscillation of the topological charge . </S>",
    "<S> first we will discuss simulations of ultrathin nanodisks , and then we will show results for cylindrical nanorods .    in our calculations , </S>",
    "<S> the total energy density @xmath1 is the sum of the ferromagnetic exchange @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the exchange stiffness and @xmath4 is the magnetization unit vector ( @xmath5 with @xmath6 the saturation magnetization ) ; the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the strength of the dmi ; the zeeman energy @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the external field ; and the magnetostatic self - energy due to dipolar - interactions @xmath11    where @xmath12 is the local demagnetizing field .    for the simulations we used the graphics - processing - unit accelerated software package _ mumax3 </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite , which solves the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation of motion    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the dimensionless damping parameter ( @xmath15 , with @xmath16 the gilbert damping frequency constant and @xmath17 the electron gyromagnetic ratio ) , and @xmath18 is the effective magnetic field consisting of both internal and external fields . </S>",
    "<S> the material parameters for fege taken from literature are : exchange stiffness @xcite @xmath19  pj / m , saturation magnetization @xcite @xmath20  ka / m , and dmi strength @xcite </S>",
    "<S> @xmath21  mj / m@xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> since the dmi energy in fege is intrinsic and not of interfacial origin , it should not depend on the thickness , hence we kept the dmi strength constant throughout all simulations .    the observables recorded during the simulations were i ) the local magnetic moment configuration in the solid @xmath4 , ii ) the net magnetization @xmath23 , and iii ) the 2d topological charge @xmath24 </S>",
    "<S> @xmath25    the cell size for the simulations of the nanodisks was set to 0.5 nm x 0.5 nm x 0.5 nm , and for the nanorods it was varied to achieve maximum performance while maintaining high spatial resolution . </S>",
    "<S> for the image shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] the cell size was 3.75 nm x 3.75 nm x 3.9 nm , whereas for more detailed analysis we used 1.875 nm x 1.875 nm x 1.97 nm ( mesh of @xmath26 for a rod with diameter of 120 nm and length of 500 nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> occasional checks were made with smaller cell sizes to confirm the validity of the results .    </S>",
    "<S> -component of the magnetization unit vector as a function of the distance from the disk center . ]         as a function of the distance ( @xmath27 ) from the rod end . </S>",
    "<S> the two cross - sections show the skyrmion ( high @xmath24 ) and mexican hat ( low @xmath24 ) spin configuration . ]    a crucial aspect for the realization of a skyrmion in an ultrathin structure , e.g. a nanodisk , is the presence of a symmetry - breaking field , either external or internal . </S>",
    "<S> it also possible to prepare the skyrmion state by applying external fields , as shown for co / pd nanodots @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in our simulations we can dynamically form a metastable skyrmion even in the absence of uniaxial anisotropy by magnetizing the sample in the out - of - plane direction using a field pulse ( @xmath28 t ) and allowing the spin structure to relax . doing this results in a left - handed skyrmion core ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a ) , in which the magnetization in the center of the disk is @xmath29 and around the perimeter of the disk is @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> we quantify the skyrmionic configuration by calculating the topological charge @xmath24 , and find a numerical value of 0.8 ( for a perfect skyrmion of @xmath31 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the deviation from the integer value is due to the tilting of the spins along the circumference of the disk by dipolar interactions .    for the confinement of the skyrmionic spin texture </S>",
    "<S> , the size of the disk needs to be comparable to the skyrmion - core radius , which depends on the interplay between the dmi and magnetostatic interactions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig1 ] shows two simulation results for diameters of ( a ) 120 nm and ( b ) 180 nm along with the magnetization profiles as a function of the distance from the disk center . for 120 nm the result is a complete skyrmion core , and for 180 nm the spin structure forms a concentric ring with alternating @xmath32 , similar to those shown in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if we further increase the radius of the disk , the ring configuration breaks down to a helical state ( not shown here ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a single skyrmion in fege ultrathin disks is stable for diameters in the range of 70 nm  135 nm , i.e. , @xmath33 , where @xmath34  nm is the characteristic pitch length for fege ( @xmath3 is the ferromagnetic exchange energy and @xmath8 is the strength of the dmi ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that without considering the energy contribution of dipolar interactions ( @xmath35 ) , a single skyrmion is only stable up to @xmath36 nm . </S>",
    "<S> dipolar interactions are therefore crucial in stabilizing the skyrmion , as they tend to align the spins along the physical edge of the disk , thus shrinking or stretching the skyrmion in order to satisfy this condition . </S>",
    "<S> this importance of dipolar interactions was recently also discussed with regards to experiments on pt / co / mgo nanostructures @xcite , where it was found that with increasing dmi strength the role played by dipolar interactions became increasingly important . </S>",
    "<S> this has to do with the interplay between two length scales , i.e. , @xmath37 and the exchange length @xcite @xmath38  nm for fege . when @xmath39 , the curling period of the spin structure is longer than the exchange length . </S>",
    "<S> as , however , the dmi increases and @xmath37 decreases , the curling is impeded by the dipolar interactions and the role of magnetostatics becomes more important .        </S>",
    "<S> now we turn to 3d structures in order to examine the dimensional evolution of the skyrmion state in cylindrical symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the state was prepared in a similar was as for the nanodisks , i.e. , saturating external field applied along the @xmath40 axis and then removed . in a nanorod with a diameter of 60 </S>",
    "<S> nm the spin configuration corresponds to an incomplete helix ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]a ) , where the core of the rod is magnetized along the @xmath40 axis and the spins on the circumference of the rod are left - handedly wrapped around the solid . </S>",
    "<S> if we increase the diameter to 120 nm , however , corresponding to a diameter at which the skyrmion core is complete in an ultrathin nanodisk , the spin structure is a striking three - dimensional _ skyrmion chain _ </S>",
    "<S> , where the core of the rod is magnetized along the @xmath40 axis but the spins away from the core form a three - dimensional spin texture with a spatial oscillation along the rod ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we investigated a range of diameters and found that the stability range for a skyrmion chain in a rod is 90 nm @xmath41 135 nm . for larger diameters , i.e. , for @xmath42 nm , the spin structure is in a complex helical - like state ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]c ) , where the variation of the moments from one edge to the other is discontinuous , and unfolds via the formation of hedgehogs , or bloch points , close to the edges of the rod , similar to those shown by milde _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ @xcite .    increasing the rod length increases the number of skyrmions in the chain . </S>",
    "<S> the dipolar interactions play an important role here , as they stretch or compress the skyrmions in order to adapt the spin texture onto the solid and fulfill the boundary conditions , as discussed above . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the number of skyrmions in the rod can only be increased by integer steps : when having a rod of certain length that contains 3 skyrmions , the number of skyrmions will remain the same while we increase the length up to the point where the rod can fit 4 skyrmions , etc . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario of skyrmion packing is topologically equivalent to atomic cluster - packing , where the number of nearest neighbors around a solute atom remains constant upon increasing the radius of the atom , and then jumps to a new configuration above a threshold value @xcite .    for a nanorod with a diameter of 120 </S>",
    "<S> nm and length of 500 nm , the spin structure contains 6 skyrmions , as seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]a , which shows the oscillation of @xmath24 inside the solid . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillation of the spin structure from one skyrmion core , i.e. , where @xmath43 , to the next is done via a helical mexican - hat - like spin texture ( see fig . [ fig3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the oscillation of @xmath24 has a sinusoidal form @xmath44 , with a period of @xmath45  nm . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , while the spin texture seems continuous , and the skyrmions along the chain connected , we see that the topological charge is localized at the skyrmion configuration ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the localization of @xmath24 can be suppressed by a symmetry - breaking field , either internal or external . </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a hypothetical scenario of a material with exactly the same parameters ( @xmath6 , @xmath3 , and @xmath8 ) , which additionally has a uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy @xmath46 that is comparable to the magnetostatic self - energy , i.e. , @xmath47  j / m@xmath48 . as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]a , the 3d oscillation of the spin structure vanishes and the result is a continuous _ skyrmion line _ along the rod with @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , if we break the symmetry by an external field along the @xmath40 direction opposing the magnetization in the core ( without having @xmath46 ) , the resulting spin configuration is again a single skyrmion line along the rod . for a one - to - one comparison between the effect of internal vs. external field , </S>",
    "<S> the applied field in this example was set equal to the anisotropy field from the example shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]a , i.e. , ( @xmath50  t ) . </S>",
    "<S> the external field not only generates a single skyrmion line , but also decreases the skyrmion radius ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , with increasing ( opposing ) @xmath51 , the skyrmion radius decreases monotonically up to the critical field , at which @xmath52 and @xmath53 . once </S>",
    "<S> @xmath54 , if we switch off the external field , the spin configuration will return to that of a skyrmion chain , but with opposite polarity .    </S>",
    "<S> all the predictions made here may be verified experimentally , either by real - space observation , i.e. , lorentz transmission electron microscopy or magnetic force microscopy , or by reciprocal space investigations , such as polarized small - angle neutron scattering .    in summary , we have shown that geometrical confinement enables the occurrence of spontaneous three - dimensional skyrmion chains in cylindrical nanorods , and that a symmetry - breaking field , either external or internal , turns the structure to that of a single skyrmion line . </S>",
    "<S> these findings provide a deeper understanding of the stability of skyrmionic spin configurations in nano - structures , where spatial confinement plays a vital role . </S>",
    "<S> they may also be of great importance for the further development of spintronics towards skyrmion - based technologies . </S>"
