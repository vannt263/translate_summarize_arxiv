    "correlated heterostructures composed of transition - metal oxides have attracted much interest both experimentally and theoretically as a new arena for studies of strongly correlated electron systems .",

    "found interface - specific conducting states between two different insulating perovskite transition - metal oxides  @xcite , one of the main interests has been directed toward the electronic properties near the hetero - interface , drastically varying with respect to the bulk components .",
    "one of the best - known examples is the laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 heterostructure .",
    "although both laalo@xmath0 and srtio@xmath0 are conventional band - insulators , recent experiments have revealed two - dimensional superconductivity  @xcite , ferromagnetic correlation  @xcite and even the coexistences of the two states at @xmath1-type polar interfaces  @xcite .",
    "these phases exhibit a distinct dependence on film - thickness and growth - condition  @xcite and an intriguing electric - field response  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , high carrier - mobility at the interface  @xcite and two - dimensional superconductivity  @xcite have been reported for latio@xmath0 ( lto)/srtio@xmath0 ( sto ) heterostructures .",
    "motivated by these experimental findings , many theoretical approaches have been proposed to describe the nature of quasi two - dimensional electron systems localized around the interface  @xcite .",
    "particularly the lto / sto interface has been extensively investigated due to the chemical similarity and small mismatch of lattice constants between perovskite compounds lto and sto  @xcite .",

    "the origin of metallic behavior at the lto / sto interface has been clarified , and , moreover , possible ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases have been investigated , also in relation to orbital ordering  @xcite and their temperature dependence  @xcite .",
    "first principles calculations have been also performed to explore the role of the lattice reconstruction , and demonstrated several spin and charge ordered phases  @xcite as well as the effects of lattice relaxation  @xcite , which modify the interface electronic structure . moreover , regg _ et al _ examined the electronic and thermoelectric transport properties , particularly focusing on the characters of quasi - particles in the inhomogeneous layered system  @xcite .    in this paper",

    ", however , some experimental setups may allow us to tune the dimensionality of the interface electron system .",
    "therefore , reflecting the broadness of the conducting electronic state , the possible @xmath2 band occupation would vary abruptly or gradually from @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) at lto to @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) at sto region beyond the interface if the thickness of the heterostructure along the stacking direction is large enough to reproduce bulk properties in each region",
    ". such sharpness of the spatially changing electron density might even modify the electronic structure only near the interface .    here",
    "we shed light on the nature of the electronic state around the hetero - interface with particular emphasis on the interplay of charge distribution and magnetic properties . as mentioned above",
    ", we consider a bi / mi / bi heterostructure , taking the example of a lto / sto heterostructure . for simplicity , we assume perfect matching of the two lattices and , thus , only focus on the electronic reconstruction based on the mobile electrons in the ti - derived band .",
    "the corresponding model heterostructure is described by the generalized hubbard model defined in ref .  .",
    "here our focus is put on the competition of spin and charge degrees of freedom while neglecting the orbital degeneracy of ti-3d band .",
    "we treat on - site interaction with the hartree - fock approximation , and calculate the ground state phase diagram as a function of the local and long - range coulomb interaction .",
    "we obtain a variety of the interface - specific magnetic and charge - ordered phases .",
    "we find that the intimate spin - charge coupling in magnetic fields causes a first - order metamagnetic transition as well as a reentrant charge - ordering transition .",

    "we choose the @xmath9-axis along @xmath10 $ ] direction .",
    "black sites at @xmath11 correspond to the @xmath12 sites of perovskite @xmath13 and @xmath14 lattices , where the relevant conduction electrons reside .",

    "we study a bi / mi / bi - type heterostructure based on the [ 001 ] stacking of @xmath4 mott insulator @xmath13 and @xmath6 band insulator @xmath14 with cubic perovskite lattice structures ; hereafter we choose the @xmath9 axis along the [ 001 ] direction .",
    "taking an example of lto / sto multilayer structure , @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) ions represent a valence of + 2 ( + 3 ) charged cation , and mobile conduction electrons reside on the @xmath12 ions which are common constituents for @xmath13 and @xmath14 . a schematic view of this system is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] .",
    "we assume the chemical similarity and perfect lattice match between two cubic perovskite components . therefore ,",
    "simulating the different valences between @xmath15 and @xmath16 ions , we define the model heterostructure via @xmath8 counter - ion layers with a positive charge @xmath19 sitting in the mott - insulating material ; @xmath20 and @xmath21 cations are here substituted with @xmath18 and neutral point charges , respectively  @xcite .",
    "hence , in addition to the repulsive electron - electron interaction , electrons suffer from the electrostatic potential of the positively charged ions placed between electrically active @xmath12 sites .",
    "the charge neutral condition requires that the total number of these electrons equals to that of @xmath18-charged @xmath15 site ions . in the present work ,",
    "the corresponding microscopic model is simplified with disregarding orbital degeneracy of @xmath12 ions , which are sometimes associated with interesting phenomena in transition - metal oxides .",
    "thus , this model heterostructure captures the essential aspects of the competition between spin and charge degrees of freedom in a spatially non - uniform environment .    to describe electron dynamics in the background of the non - uniform attractive potential , we introduce the generalized hubbard model given by , @xmath22 here , the kinetic term @xmath23 is presented by the single band tight - binding model , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an annihilation operator of an electron with spin @xmath26 at the site labeled by index @xmath27 as @xmath11 with lattice constant @xmath28 .",
    "electron hopping with the transfer integral @xmath29 is limited between the nearest - neighbor sites on the square lattice . @xmath30 and @xmath31 correspond to electron - electron and electron - ion coulomb interaction given by , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the spin dependent occupation number , and @xmath17 specifies a position of the cation . both the electron - electron repulsion and the electron - ion attraction",
    "are introduced as a long - ranged coulomb interaction whose characteristic energy scale is given by the coefficient @xmath34 with the dielectric constant @xmath35 of the host lattice . in eq .",
    "( [ ee ] ) , the strong on - site repulsion between electrons is considered via an ordinary hubbard interaction term with magnitude @xmath36 . note that the strength of the on - site interaction has the same value on all @xmath12 sites throughout the heterostructure , i.  e.  the spatial inhomogeneity of this model is characterized by the @xmath31 term .",
    "therefore , it is naturally assumed that the electron density profile is mainly determined by these long - range interactions . on the one hand , the broad charge distribution , extended into the band - insulating material ,",
    "is favored in order to suppress repulsive electron - electron interaction @xmath30 , but on the other hand , the attractive electrostatic potential @xmath31 confines the conduction electrons in the mott - insulating region .",
    "we also take the effects of external magnetic fields into account to give a systematical study of the magnetism in the inhomogeneous system . in the current study",
    ", the magnetic fields are treated through the zeeman term .",
    "@xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 indicate the electron g - factor and the bohr magneton , respectively , and @xmath40 is a magnetization along the applied magnetic fields .",
    "hereafter , the applied magnetic fields are measured in units of @xmath41 .",
    "the ground state phases are governed essentially by three parameters : thickness of positive ion layers @xmath8 , on - site hubbard @xmath36 and the coupling constant of long - range coulomb interaction @xmath42 .",
    "as mentioned in ref .",
    ", for the example of the experimentally fabricated lto / sto heterostructure substantial uncertainties exist in estimating the realistic values of @xmath36 and @xmath42 except for an experimentally tunable parameter @xmath8 .",
    "particularly the dielectric constant @xmath43 in bulk sto samples strongly depends on temperature  @xcite and electric fields  @xcite , and can even change its value by more than one order of magnitude as a function of these quantities .",
    "therefore , in addition to @xmath8 , discussions on the role of @xmath36 and @xmath42 may be important to gain physical insights into the electronic and magnetic properties of realistic heterostructures , particularly into the interplay of spin and charge degrees of freedom .",
    "however , a systematic and exact computational study of the model hamiltonian [ eq .  ( [ ham ] ) ] over a wide range of parameters is practically excluded .",
    "hence , in the current study , the on - site repulsion and long - range coulomb interaction are treated by employing unrestricted hartree - fock and hartree approximation , respectively . here , for the derivation of the effective single - particle hamiltonian ,",
    "the on - site hubbard term @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ ee ] ) decoupled as follows , @xmath45 where the site - dependent expectation values @xmath46 are calculated self - consistently .",
    "however , not only the energetically most favorable state , several self - consistent solutions are typically allowed in mean - field treatments .",
    "we thus consider a variety of ordered states allowed up to two sublattices and select the one with the lowest energy after many iteration steps of @xmath47 .",
    "as compared to other many - body methods such as dynamical mean field theory , the hartree - fock treatment treats electron correlation effects only with limitations .",
    "we , however , believe that the approximation captures the qualitatively correct tendency towards certain electron correlations , while overestimating the realization of actual order .    in the following ,",
    "we restrict our investigation to the physically relevant parameter regime @xmath48 at zero temperature .",
    "we consider a supercell geometry of about @xmath49-layers structure including @xmath8 cation planes , and employ open boundary conditions for solving the mean - field hamiltonian . since electrons are well confined within this multi - layer structure for all the parameter values considered in our study , the boundary condition would not change the quantitative aspects of our present calculation .",
    "in order to gain insights into the electronic and magnetic properties , we first discuss the ground - state phase diagram . in this section ,",
    "we fix the external magnetic field to zero and investigate possible phases in the @xmath36-@xmath42 plane .",
    "as pointed out by previous studies  @xcite , the profile of the charge distribution is sensitive to the energy scale of long - range coulomb interaction @xmath42 . at small @xmath42 ,",
    "electrons are extended to the band - insulating region due to the weak attractive potential of cation layers , and the electron density profile gradually varies from @xmath50 ( mi ) to @xmath51 ( bi ) across the interface . in contrast , electrons are strongly confined along the @xmath9 direction for large @xmath42 , and a more abrupt change of charge distribution is observed in the vicinity of the interface . to characterize this",
    " sharpness \" in the charge distribution around the interface , we introduce a thomas - fermi screening length which roughly corresponds to @xmath52  @xcite . with this value",
    ", we can distinguish between  broad \" and  abrupt \" variations of the charge distribution via @xmath53 and @xmath54 , for which the positive electrostatic potential confines mobile electrons between the insulating regions .",
    "we expect that the electronic and magnetic phases near the interface are sensitive to the electron density profile , and change their character around @xmath55 .",
    "similar insights have been also given in the preceding studies using double exchange  @xcite and holstein - hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "we investigate possible in - plane magnetic and charge ordered states with a two - sublattice structure .",
    "dmft calculations performed by okamoto and millis  @xcite showed that a ferromagnetic ordering is favored in the vicinity of the interface in the large @xmath36 regime .",
    "therefore , besides the conventional paramagnetic ( pm ) , ferromagnetic ( f ) and antiferromagnetic ( af ) states , we allow for a spatial modulation of the magnetic moment . along the @xmath9-axis , a possible magnetic state can vary smoothly from the af state in the mott - insulating region to the fm state around the interface .",
    "we search for the favorable direction of the fm moment relative to that of the af moment .",
    "in addition , although a simple cubic lattice with band filling @xmath56 prefers the g - type af ( gaf ) ordering showing @xmath57 spin configuration particularly in the @xmath58 limit , the strong spatial inhomogeneity in the charge density profile may induce a uniaxial distortion for the possible spin alignment in the @xmath9-direction . hence , as trial magnetic states in the mott - insulating region",
    ", we further take into account the a - type af ( aaf ) and c - type af ( caf ) structure having the @xmath59 and @xmath60 spin orderings , respectively .     and long - range coulomb interaction @xmath42 .",
    "the number of the counter - ion layers is @xmath61 .",
    "our focus is put on the physically relevant regime , @xmath48 .",
    "six phases are shown : paramagnetic metallic state ( pmm ) , paramagnetic charge ordered state ( pmco ) , antiferromagnetic state with @xmath62 spin configuration ( gaf ) , @xmath63-type antiferromagnetic state ( aaf ) , gaf state with canted antiferromagnetic state at the interface ( ca - gaf ) and gaf state with checkerboard charge - ordering at the interface ( co - gaf ) .",

    "six phases are found within the current mean - field analysis : pm metallic state ( pmm ) , pm charge ordered ( co ) state with checkerboard pattern ( pmco ) , gaf state , aaf state , canted af state around the interface accompanied with gaf ordering in mott - insulating region ( ca - gaf ) , and ferromagnetic checkerboard co state at the interface plane with gaf ordering for mott - insulating side ( co - gaf ) .",
    "the phase boundaries , represented by the solid ( broken ) lines , correspond to the first-(second- ) order phase transitions . in order to examine the role of the counter - ion layer thickness @xmath8 , the thicker heterostructure , involving @xmath66 positive layers ,",

    "the corresponding phase diagram is , however , analogous to the @xmath61 case apart from the aaf state , which is absent in the case of @xmath66 .",
    "this type of @xmath8-dependence is further discussed in sec .",
    "[ subsec : canted af ] .",
    "intriguingly , the charge ( magnetic ) properties in the mean - field phase diagram are dramatically changed around @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "let us first focus on the small @xmath42 regime ( weak confinement regime @xmath54 )",
    ". at small @xmath36 the possible ground state is pmm . with increasing @xmath36 ,",
    "this state undergoes a continuous phase transition to the gaf state , whose behavior is in good agreement with ref .  ; in spite of the lower occupancy @xmath69 , the finite af moment , aligned in the same direction as that of the neighboring layers , is observed at the interface layer ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : ca_u12_dens ] ) . note that this gaf state is stabilized in the whole @xmath42 region at intermediate @xmath36 .",
    "when @xmath36 is further increased , we encounter a distinct magnetic phase : a ferromagnetic component of the magnetization spontaneously arises around the hetero - interface , giving rise to a tilt of the af moment .",
    "we , thus , arrive at the ca - gaf phase , although aaf states are still stable under certain conditions .",
    "the detailed study for the ca - gaf state is given in sec .",
    "[ subsec : canted af ] .",
    "on the other hand , the charge sector exhibits quite different properties for @xmath70 ( @xmath53 ) . in this case , the pmco state is stabilized in the small-@xmath36 region , which turns into the gaf state around @xmath71 via a first - order transition . here , the charge - ordering is realized in the whole mott - insulating region .",
    "we naturally expect that the pmco state is stabilized by the long - range coulomb interaction  @xcite . for the large @xmath36 region , we propose another interesting mechanism to stabilize the charge ordering in the co - gaf phase , which will be addressed later in sec .",
    "[ subsec : charge order ] .    in the following subsections",
    ", we give a more detailed discussions on the phase diagram with particular emphasis on the two remarkable phases realized in the large @xmath36 region : the canted antiferromagnetic state and the charge ordered state .",
    "we start with discussions on the possible ordered states for @xmath72 ( @xmath54 ) . in this case , the weak attractive potential makes the conduction electron deeply penetrate into the band - insulating region , and , thus , the charge distribution near the interface is relatively sensitive to the values of @xmath42 .",
    "hence , the electronic phases for @xmath72 would be connected with the spatial variation of the charge distribution through the band - filling dependence of the typical bulk phases  @xcite . in this regime , we find three phases which are common to @xmath61 and @xmath66 : pmm , gaf and ca - gaf states . among them ,",
    "the most salient phase we found is the ca - gaf state , because there is no analog in the bulk phase diagram  @xcite .",
    "this state is defined by the @xmath9-axis modulation of the antiferromagnetic spin alignment ; around the interface , the alternating up and down spins are both tilted in the same direction , and , thus , a ferromagnetic moment perpendicular to the af moment emerges . to obtain the above solution we consider the two kinds of the phases accompanied with finite magnetization around the interface , which are distinguished by the angle between the direction of the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic moment : perpendicular or parallel . with the energetic comparison ,",
    "we find the solution with perpendicular one is favorable , and therefore the interplay of the f and af orderings induces the spin canting in the vicinity of the interface .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ca_u12_dens ] , several quantities in the ca - gaf state are plotted as a function of the distance @xmath9 from the center of the heterostructure : the spatial modulation of the layer - dependent electron density @xmath73 , magnetization @xmath74 and staggered magnetization @xmath75 .",
    "this figure confirms the above statement that the weak charge binding @xmath76 ( @xmath54 ) induces the charge leakage toward the band - insulating region ; the electron density drops from @xmath77 to @xmath78 over a few layers across the interface , and the finite electron density is even observed in outer layers ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "in addition , the band occupation is always less than @xmath3 through the heterostructure .",
    "these features are analogous to the preceding studies  @xcite . turning to the properties of magnetism",
    ", the values of the staggered magnetization are almost saturated inside the mi region ( @xmath80 ) and at the interface layers , respectively , and the magnetic moments are gradually diminished away from the corresponding regions .",
    "we note that in this ca - gaf phase , the characteristic behaviors of @xmath73 , @xmath75 and @xmath74 presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ca_u12_dens ] are consistent with the dmft results  @xcite , where good agreement between dmft and hartree -fock analysis is only found for the electron density and the staggered magnetization .    , @xmath81 , and @xmath66 .",
    "counter - ions are placed at @xmath82 .",

    "all such features manifest themselves in the corresponding layer - resolved single - particle spectral function @xmath87 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ca_u12_dos ] , where we plot one of the spin - dependent components @xmath88 . around the center of the heterostructure ( @xmath89 )",
    ", the conduction band gets quite narrow , and the opening of the gap ( @xmath90 ) is observed due to the af ordering ; inside the mi region , the competition of the on - site @xmath36 and the attractive coulomb potential sustains the electron occupancy approximately @xmath91 per site .",
    "in contrast , in the bi regions , the form of spectral function well reproduces that of the free electrons in the bulk systems @xcite , and the whole conduction band is finally pushed above the fermi level for @xmath92 .",
    "however , when approaching the interface , the spectral function is gradually shifted downward to the chemical potential because of the interplay of the electron spreading and binding effects along the @xmath9-axis .",
    "metallic layers are , thus , formed around the interface , and as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ca_u12_dens ] , these layers also carry a ferromagnetic spin polarization .",
    "note that although the layer - dependent magnetization looks in good agreement with the previous dmft analysis  @xcite , the origin of the present magnetization should be understood by the so - called stoner mechanism .",
    "actually the mean - field phase diagram of two - dimensional hubbard model well describes the emergence of the spontaneous magnetization for @xmath93 at the interface showing @xmath94 band occupation  @xcite .",
    "the small , but finite ferromagnetic moments in the neighboring layers could , thus , be identified as a proximity effect from the f ordering in the interface . therefore , it is necessary to employ other sophisticated methods to give more accurate descriptions of the magnetism in the correlated heterostructure .",

    "we now return to the discussion on the ca - gaf state . as can be seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : ca_u12_dens ] and [ fig : ca_u12_dos ] , the gradual suppression of the spin canting is observed toward the center of the heterostructure , and accordingly the canted af state is restricted to only a narrow region around the interface .",
    "therefore , these results suggest the weak thickness - dependence for the stabilization of the ca - gaf state .",
    "this finding is supported by the obtained phase diagram with on - site @xmath36 and cation layer thickness @xmath8 , which is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : u12ec08unphase ] . for @xmath96 ,",

    ", the result of @xmath95 shows a considerably different behavior : the pmm state for small @xmath36 , the aaf state for narrow range of intermediate @xmath36 and the f state for large @xmath36 . here ,",
    "in the ca - gaf state at @xmath97 , all layers in the mi show the metallic density of states and a canted spin state , while such layers are limited around the interface for thicker heterostructures @xmath98 . compared with the pmm - to - gaf transition line ,",
    "the phase boundary between the gaf and the ca - gaf state are less sensitive to @xmath8 .",
    "as mentioned above , this tendency may be explained by the stoner concept for metallic ferromagnets , because the electron occupancy at the interface layer is essentially independent of the layer thickness for large @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath99 becomes smaller it is expected that the corresponding phase diagram shows a behavior more sensitive to the thickness @xmath8 .",
    "this point is understood as follows ; the weak charge binding reduces the occupancy at the center of heterostructure , and accordingly smaller @xmath8 further assists the electron leakage toward the band - insulating region and shows smaller occupation even at the central layers , as compared to thicker heterostructures .",
    "the calculated @xmath36-@xmath42 phase diagram in fig.[fig : n4_uec_phase ] confirms the above statement .",
    "actually , at @xmath100 , we can find the aaf phase at @xmath61 , which is not found at @xmath66 .",
    "unfortunately , however , it seems difficult for the present mean - field analysis to catch the physical aspect for such small @xmath42 region because the stoner mean field treatment likely overestimates the ferromagnetic tendency in those layers  @xcite .",

    "open and filled circles represent the electron occupations at a and b sublattices , respectively . ]    in this subsection , we focus on the regime @xmath102 ( @xmath104 ) where electrons are strongly confined along the @xmath9 direction .",
    "compared to @xmath105 , the electronic phase diagram for @xmath102 is less sensitive to the layer thickness @xmath8 and the profile of the electron density . in the corresponding parameter regime , the strong attractive potential traps the electrons inside the mi region , and accordingly the most mobile electrons are absent in the band - insulating region .",
    "this observation suggests that the role of the interlayer hopping , i.  e.  electron hopping along the @xmath9 direction , is distinguished from that of in - planes , particularly around the interface .",
    "it is because the layer - dependent electron occupancy shows an abrupt change across the interface : from @xmath106 in the mott - insulating region to @xmath51 in the band - insulating region . in the region of @xmath102 , the corresponding phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : n4_uec_phase ] typically consists of the copm , gaf and co - gaf state .",

    "according to our numerical results , a - sites always carry the lower electron density compared to b - sites around @xmath129 . to clarify the relation between this spin structure and the interface charge - ordering , we take into account the charge confinement effect along the @xmath9-axis ; for @xmath102 ( i.e. @xmath53 ) , the strong charge binding via the positive background localizes the electrons inside the heterostructure ( @xmath130 in fig .",
