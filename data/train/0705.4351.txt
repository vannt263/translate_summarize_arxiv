    "besides , curves corresponding to @xmath135 and @xmath136 are lapped over with each other because there is little difference in their numerical expression .",
    "although eight different higgs triplet yukawa couplings result in the same neutrino mass matrix through the type - ii seesaw formula , their effects on lepton - flavor - violating processes are very different . as a result",
    ", we may check the stability of the type - ii seesaw formula by measuring the branching ratios of the lepton - flavor - violating @xmath137 decays accurately in the future experiments .",
    "in addition to the right - handed neutrinos , the higgs triplet is another source of the neutrino mass generation in the type - ii seesaw model , so the evolution of the neutrino mass matrix is a little different from that in the type - i seesaw model .",
    "besides , the duality property for the type - ii seesaw formula indicates that there exist eight possible higgs triplet yukawa couplings @xmath138 which , for a given @xmath57 , result in exactly the same mass matrix of light neutrinos . in this article , we have calculated the rges for the evolutions of the type - ii seesaw neutrino mass matrices from the seesaw scale to the electro - weak scale in the supersymmetric left - right model .",
