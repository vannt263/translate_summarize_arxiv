    "quantum dot devices have recently been the focus of intense investigation , due to the impressive experimental control available in manipulating the microscopic interactions responsible for kondo physics@xcite . in particular the classic spin-@xmath0 kondo effect@xcite  in which a localized spin is fully screened by coupling to itinerant conduction electrons in a single attached metallic lead  has now been widely studied experimentally ( see _ eg _ [ ] ) .",
    "but arguably the most diverse and subtle kondo physics results from the _ interplay _ between internal spin and orbital degrees of freedom in _ coupled _ quantum dots .",
    "a wide range of strongly correlated electron behavior is accessible in such systems , with variants of the standard kondo effect@xcite , quantum phase transitions@xcite and non - fermi liquid phases@xcite having been studied theoretically .",
    "in particular , both double@xcite and triple@xcite quantum dots have been shown to demonstrate low - temperature behavior quite different from their single - dot counterparts@xcite .",
    "advances in nanofabrication techniques@xcite , and atomic - scale manipulation using scanning tunneling microscopy@xcite , now allow for the construction of coupled quantum dot structures , in which the geometry and capacitance of the dots can be controlled , and their couplings fine - tuned@xcite .",
    "experimental access to a rich range of kondo and related physics is thus within reach .",
    "one of the most delicate effects , however , arises in the two - channel kondo ( 2ck ) model proposed by nozires and blandin@xcite , which describes a spin-@xmath0 symmetrically coupled to two independent metallic leads .",
    "the standard , strong coupling fermi liquid fixed point common in single - channel models is destabilized here . much studied theoretically ( for a review see [ ] ) , the dot spin in the 2ck model is overscreened at low temperatures , with each channel competing to compensate the local moment .",
    "the nontrivial intermediate - coupling fixed point which controls the low - temperature behavior of the system has a number of unusual non - fermi - liquid ( nfl ) properties@xcite , including a residual entropy of @xmath1 and a magnetic susceptibility which diverges logarithmically at low temperature .",
    "the key ingredient of this 2ck physics is the suppression of charge transfer between the two symmetrically coupled leads@xcite  the necessity in essence of a central _ spin_. experimental realizations of 2ck physics have been variously sought in _",
    "heavy fermion systems containing uranium@xcite , scattering from 2-level systems using ballistic metal point contacts@xcite , systems with tunneling between nonmagnetic impurities in metals@xcite , and from impurities in graphene@xcite ; albeit that the interpretation of observed behavior in terms of 2ck physics is not always unambiguous .    recently however , potok _ et al _ have demonstrated@xcite clear two - channel behavior in a coupled quantum dot device in which one small and one large dot are tunnel - coupled , with the small dot also coupled to a metallic lead .",
    "the large dot acts as an interacting second lead , but is fine - tuned to the coulomb blockade regime so that charge transfer is energetically disfavoured .",
    "a small degree of inter - lead charge transfer must nonetheless occur , so ultimately the system is a fermi liquid , with the 2ck fixed point destabilized below some low - temperature scale ( which crossover has been widely studied theoretically@xcite , as has the instability of the 2ck fixed point to channel asymmetry@xcite ) .",
    "but at finite temperatures , 2ck physics is clearly observed@xcite .",
    "studying coupled quantum dot systems in a two - channel environment has attracted considerable theoretical interest recently@xcite , in part because nfl states are accessible .",
    "the two - impurity two - channel kondo model@xcite ( where two antiferromagnetically coupled dots are each coupled to their own lead ) is a prime example , in which the tendency to form a local singlet state on the two dots competes with the formation of two separated single - channel kondo states@xcite .",
    "the quantum critical point separating these phases is again the 2ck fixed point@xcite .",
    "triple quantum dot ( tqd ) models with three dots coupled to two leads in a mirror - symmetric fashion have also been studied@xcite , recent work@xcite by itko and bona showing in particular that a range of fixed points familiar from simpler quantum impurity models are accessible in a ring model .",
    "indeed both two - channel and two - impurity kondo effects are realised , on tuning the interdot couplings as a third dot is coupled to the two - impurity two - channel system@xcite .",
    "tqds arranged in a ring geometry also provide@xcite the simplest and most direct means of studying the effect of local frustration on kondo physics .",
    "in mirror - symmetric systems , all dot states can be classified by their parity under left@xmath2right interchange@xcite .",
    "this symmetry permits a level crossing of states in the isolated trimer on varying the interdot couplings , with a pair of degenerate doublets comprising the ground state when all dots are equivalent .",
    "it was recently shown@xcite that this level - crossing is preserved in the full many - body system when a single lead is attached .",
    "the situation is however more subtle on coupling the trimer to two leads , which is the focus of the present paper .",
    "we study a two - channel tqd ring model , shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ dots ] ( and discussed below ) , as a function of the interdot exchange couplings ; using the density matrix extension@xcite of wilson s numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) technique@xcite .",
    "we show that 2ck physics predominates in this model , but that two _ distinct _",
    "2ck phases must in fact arise since local trimer states of different parity can couple to the leads . in consequence ,",
    "one expects a quantum phase transition to occur between the two 2ck phases .",
    "this is indeed shown to arise , with the 2ck phases separated by a nontrivial quantum critical point , the nature of which is uncovered explicitly and analysed in detail .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we discuss the two - channel tqd hamiltonian , and develop low - energy effective models to describe the behavior of the system when deep in each 2ck phase .",
    "symmetry arguments indicate the presence of a quantum phase transition near to the point of inherent magnetic frustration in the tqd , and an effective low - energy model valid in the vicinity of the transition is derived .",

    ". a small degree of charge transfer , which would arise in a real tqd device from interdot tunnel - couplings ( as opposed to exchange couplings ) , will ultimately lead to a crossover@xcite from a 2ck to a stable fermi liquid fixed point , below some characteristic low - temperature scale .",
