    "recent advances in estimation and identification ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite and the references therein ) stemming from mathematical control theory may be summarized by the two following facts :    * their algebraic nature permits to derive exact non - asymptotic formulae for obtaining the unknown quantities in real time .",
    "* there is no need to know the statistical properties of the corrupting noises .",
    "those techniques have already been applied in many concrete situations , including signal processing ( see the references in @xcite ) .",
    "their recent and successful extension to discrete - time linear control systems @xcite has prompted us to study their relevance to financial time series .",
    "the relationship between time series analysis and control theory is well documented ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "our viewpoint seems nevertheless to be quite new when compared to the existing literature .",
    "the title of this communication is due to its obvious connection with some aspects of _ technical analysis _ , or _ charting _ ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite and the references therein ) , which is widely used among traders and financial professionals .      consider the univariate time series @xmath1 : @xmath2 is not regarded here as a stochastic process like in the familiar arma and arima models but is supposed to satisfy `` approximatively '' a linear difference equation @xmath3 where @xmath4 .",
    "introduce as in digital signal processing the additive decomposition @xmath5 where    * @xmath6 is the _ trendline _ which satisfies eq .",
    "exactly ; * the additive `` noise '' @xmath7 is the mismatch between the real data and the trendline .",
    "thus @xmath8 where @xmath9 we only assume that the `` ergodic mean '' of @xmath10 is @xmath11 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath12 it means that , @xmath13 , the moving average @xmath14 is close to @xmath11 if @xmath15 is large enough .",

    "most of the stochastic processes , like finite linear combinations of i.i.d .",
    "zero - mean processes , which are associated to time series modeling , do satisfy almost surely such a weak assumption .",
    "our analysis    * does not make any difference between non - stationary and stationary time series , * does not need the often tedious and cumbersome trend and seasonality decomposition ( our trendlines include the seasonalities , if they exist )",
    ".      it should be clear that    * a concrete time series can not be `` well '' approximated in general by a solution of a `` parsimonious '' eq . , _",
    "i.e. _ , a linear difference equation of low order ; * the use of large order linear difference equations , or of nonlinear ones , might lead to a formidable computational burden for their identifications without any clear - cut forecasting benefit .",
    "we adopt therefore the quite promising viewpoint of @xcite where the control of `` complex '' systems is achieved without trying a global identification but thanks to elementary models which are only valid during a short time interval and are continuously updated .",
    "we utilize here low order difference equations .",
    "then the window size for the moving average does not need to be `` large ''",
