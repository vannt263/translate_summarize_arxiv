    "dust grains to which the observed emission is attributed have lifetimes much shorter than the ages of the central stars ; dust grains are continuously replenished by collisional cascades from hidden planetesimals , approximately kilometer - sized or larger bodies . however , since gravity plays a dominant role in determining the outcome of planetesimal collisions , collisional fragmentation of planetesimals to start collisional cascades needs collisional velocities between planetesimals exceeding their surface escape velocities .",
    "therefore , significant perturbations to increase the collisional velocities between planetesimals for collisional fragmentation are required for the formation of debris discs .",

    "the collisional cascade grinds bodies down until radiation pressure from the host star blows them away .",
    "the collisional cascade and the subsequent blow - out reduce the surface density of planetesimals in the disc . along with this reduction , embryo growth stalls ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the dust mass supplied by the collisional cascade decreases . on the other hand , the formation timescale of planetary embryos is longer in the outer disc ; planetary growth propagates from the inner to outer disc",
    "when the dust mass produced by planet formation decreases in the inner disc , subsequent planet formation increases the dust production rate in the outer disc .",

    "planet formation propagates from the inner to outer disc , and the dust supply region moves in turn with planet formation . since collisional fragmentation reduces the surface density of planetesimals , the dust production rate gradually decreases after planet formation occurs . as a result ,",
    "planet formation forms narrow debris discs from inside out if initial planetesimal discs have a smooth radial distribution or have no radial cutoff .",
    "however , we find that planetesimal discs are likely narrow to account for most observational fluxes of debris discs around g - type stars .",
    "planet formation in narrow planetesimal belts can also better explain debris discs around a - type stars @xcite . for g stars ,",
    "the plausible disc radii are estimated in this paper to be 2535au for an initial planetesimal radius of @xmath152 km , whereas they are 4080au for smaller initial planetesimals .",
    "their radii are comparable to those obtained from the simple estimate shown in   [ sc : obs_data ] , whereas the total mass of bodies is not well determined from the simple estimate because of the uncertainty of the size distribution of large bodies ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dist_mass ] and table [ tab : best_fit ] ) .",
    "in addition , from more detailed analyses we find that 100 km sized planetesimals are most likely to explain the observational fluxes .",
    "the fluxes of debris discs are mainly determined by thermal emission of dust grains of size 1100 . however , in previous studies , the debris disc fluxes caused by planet formation are calculated by extrapolation from the results of simulations that only treat bodies larger than @xmath153 m @xcite .",
    "therefore , their model fluxes are underestimated by a factor 310 , compared to simulations handling down to @xmath154-sized dust grains . on the other hand ,",
    "previous simulations included a gaseous component with a lifetime of @xmath88 years , while we ignore the effects of gas even in early times .",
    "even starting with similar initial planetesimals , the time when disc fluxes increase is earlier for our simulation .",
    "this means that gas drag plays an important role in flux evolution before 100 million years . indeed ,",
    "since collisional cascades can not effectively produce @xmath154-sized bodies in a gaseous disc @xcite , disc fluxes may not rise before gas depletion occurs .    if gas depletion is taken into account , the inner edge of a disc may also be naturally explained .",
    "if discs still have as much gas as the minimum - mass solar nebula , collisional fragmentation between bodies smaller than about 10 m does not occur because of damping due to gas drag .",
    "hence , collisional cascade induced by planet formation do not significantly produce bodies smaller than 10 m and the bodies at the low - mass end of the collisional cascade are depleted by radial drift due to gas drag @xcite .",
    "after gas depletion , collisional cascades can produce smaller bodies and then debris disc fluxes increase .",
    "if planet formation occurs inside a radius @xmath155 prior to gas depletion , planets are subsequently formed beyond @xmath155 in a gas - free disc .",
    "if @xmath155 corresponds to the inner edge radius @xmath6 of a planetesimal disc that we assume in this paper , the flux evolution is expected to be similar : the inner edges of planetesimal discs may be related to the gas depletion of protoplanetary discs . on the other hand , gas giant planets formed inside @xmath6 dynamically",
    "clean up around their orbits , which may also contribute to the formation of the inner edges of planetesimal discs .",
    "planetesimal formation beyond several 10au is difficult because radial drift is more rapid than the collisional growth of dust in protoplanetary discs ; possible formation region of planetesimals via collisional growth is inside several 10au @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "if stars are born in a cluster , stars experience close stellar encounters during their escape from the cluster .",
    "such an early stellar encounter truncates the disc ; a stellar passage at @xmath156au as expected in the relatively dense clusters produces an outer edge of planet forming region at 30au @xcite and explains some dynamical properties of kuiper belt objects @xcite . therefore , planetesimal formation and/or an early stellar encounter may explain the outer edges of planetesimal discs .    in the solar system ,",
    "jupiter and saturn were formed before the gas lifetime of the solar nebula , while uranus and neptune were formed after significant gas depletion .",
    "planet formation in gas - free discs might have occurred beyond 1020au .",
    "an early stellar encounter as an explanation of the orbital distribution of kuiper belt objects may yield the outer edge of the planetesimal disc at around 50au @xcite .",
    "therefore , narrow planetesimal discs composed of large planetesimals ( @xmath157 km ) that are very likely to form debris discs might be similar to that of the solar system .",
    "taking into account gas depletion , the similarity to the solar system should be address in future studies .",
