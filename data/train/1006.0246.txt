    "early star cluster evolution generally leads to dissolution into the field due to rapid gas expulsion associated with evolutionary effects of massive stars such as supernovae and stellar winds .",
    "this causes abrupt changes in the gravitational potential , to the point that significant fractions of the low - mass stars with high velocity in the outer region escape from the cluster ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "bound open clusters ( ocs ) , i.e. those that keep dynamical stability after the first @xmath03040myr , appear to be minority of about 5% ( @xcite ) .",
    "there is a high discrepancy between the birthrate of embedded clusters ( 24myr@xmath1kpc@xmath2 , @xcite ) and ocs ( 0.25myr@xmath1kpc@xmath2 according to @xcite , and 0.45myr@xmath1kpc@xmath2 according to @xcite ) within 2kpc of the sun .",
    "this is likely a consequence of the high rate of infant mortality .",
    "the cluster survival depends primarily on the dynamical state of the stars , i.e. , their virial ratio immediately before the onset of gas expulsion @xcite , while the star - formation efficiency has a secondary role . as an example of a dissolving cluster",
    ", a recent study showed that bochum1 has an eroded radial density profile ( rdp ) and a detached core , suggesting , in that case , the genesis of a small ob association ( @xcite ) .",
    "young ocs are probes of the early physical processes occuring in embedded and post - embedded clusters . in recent years",
    "our group has analyzed main sequence ( ms ) and pre - main sequence ( pms ) stellar contents of such objects using powerful tools for field decontamination ( ngc4755 in @xcite ; ngc6611 in @xcite ; pismis5 , ngc1931 , vdb80 and bdbs96 in @xcite ; and ngc2244 in @xcite ) .",
    "the development of infrared astronomy during the last years has improved our understanding about the origin of clusters , but there is a lot of questions to be answered yet . can all intermediate steps of early cluster evolution be tracked ?",
    "can evolutionary scenarios be tested ?",
    "the present work together with other recent ones by our group address this puzzle , which is fundamental for the understanding of star cluster and field populations build up in the galaxy .",
    "another fundamental question is whether massive stars can be formed in isolation , or if isolated massive stars are remnants of dispersed embedded clusters . @xcite and @xcite found that 4@xmath32% of all o - type stars with @xmath4@xmath58mag could have been formed outside a cluster . @xcite",
    "have suggested that some apparently isolated o - stars are in fact low - mass clusters ( @xmath5100m@xmath6 ) with only one massive star .",
    "n - body simulations by @xcite showed that the orion nebula cluster could have lost at least half of its ob stars as runaways during early cluster evolution .",
    "the presence of bow - shocks associated with massive stars can be used as an indicator of ejection of these stars at supersonic velocities ( e.g. @xcite ) , when the proper motion can not be measured properly because of large distances and shortly separated epochs . however ,",
    "only a fraction @xmath720% of runaway ob stars produce bow - shocks .    in the present study",
    ", we explore a star - forming complex related to the sh2 - 132 hii region ( @xcite ) that embeds some previously undetected clusters . using 2mass photometry we analyse colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) and rdps of 5 star clusters related or possibly related to sh2 - 132 hii .",
    "an additional star cluster projected close to the complex is also studied .",
    "a radio continuum emission analysis of sh2 - 132 ( @xcite ) indicated the giant nature of this complex and its evolved character ( low electron densities , large linear diameter and an ionized gas mass greater than 10@xmath8m@xmath6 ) , which suggests a suitable laboratory for early dynamical and hydrodynamical evolution .",
    "we also investigate two wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars in the area , searching for possible star clusters around them .    in sect.[sec :",
    "dir ] we present the targets . in sect.[sec : cmd ] we carry out cmd analysis and estimate cluster parameters . in sect.[sec : rdp ] we study the density profiles .",
    "discussions are given in sect.[sec : dis ] .",
    "finally , conclusions of this work are in sect.[sec : con ] .",
    "the number of embedded star clusters in a given star - forming region is essential to study the gas expulsion and dynamical evolution effects , in order to know about cluster binarity or multiplicity ( @xcite ) . in this investigation line",
    "we searched for new embedded clusters in sh2 - 132 complex .",
    "we present in table[tab : clu ] the star clusters in the area of the sh2 - 132 .",
    "the radii given in col.5 were chosen by eye for decontamination purposes ( sect.[sec : cmd ] ) , since they provide a good contrast with the field .",
    "fig.[fig : sh132 ] shows an @xmath9-band 2nd generation digitized sky survey ( xdss ) image of the whole complex with the positions of the star clusters ( table[tab : clu ] ) together with the dark nebulae ldn1150 , ldn1154 and ldn1161 ( @xcite ) .",
    "sbb1 , sbb2 , sbb3 and sbb4 were found by one of us ( tas ) using the 2mass atlas .",
    "the optical oc teutsch127 ( @xcite ) contains a trapezium system ( trap900 ) found by @xcite .",
    "berkeley94 was studied with photographic photometry by @xcite and the derived parameters are given in webda : age @xmath10=10myr , reddening _",
    "e(b@xmath11v)_=0.61 and distance from the sun",
    "_ d@xmath6_=2.63kpc .",
    "it is important to analyse berkeley94 also with 2mass photometry for comparison purposes .",

    "col.1 : star cluster name , col.2 : central density , col.3 : core radius ( arcmin ) , col.4 : core radius ( pc ) assuming a distance from the sun _ d@xmath6_=3.6kpc , col.5 : background density .",
    "the morphology of sh2 - 132 , which contains several bubbles suggests triggered star formation similarly to sh2 - 284 ( @xcite ) .",
    "additional small star clusters not yet identified are possible in the area of the sh2 - 132 complex .",
    "a higher resolution mid - infrared study would be important .    teutsch127 appears to be a young oc with age @xmath05myr , while sbb1 seems to be @xmath01myr old .",
    "sbb1 is deeply embedded and may result from a stellar feedback of o and b - type stars in somewhat older surrounding clusters .",
    "it is superimposed on a probable bow - shock @xmath03@xmath12 to the southwest of teutsch127 and wr153ab",
    ". however , this bow - shock seems to have been generated in sbb2 .",
    "we may be witnessing sequential effects of star formation .",
    "the presence of the trapezium system trap900 in the center of teutsch127 will certainly have an important role in the cluster evolution .",
    "trapezium systems evolve into hierarchical systems ( with a much larger separation among its components ) or even disperse in a few million years producing runaway stars .",
    "the oldest one identified so far has @xmath050myr ( @xcite ) .",
    "teutsch127 is close to wr153ab that is a spectroscopic binary with a primary wn6o and an o6i ( @xcite ) .",
    "evolution of this wr to spectral type wc and its subsequent explosion as supernova will certainly have an impact on the dynamical evolution of neighbouring clusters ( teutsch127 , sbb1 and sbb2 ) , by means of gas removal .",
    "sbb1 is the youngest cluster in the sample and remains embedded .",
    "the residual gas expulsion and stellar evolution may cause an increase of core radius .",
    "since sbb2 expulsed its residual gas , star formation must have stopped and its survival as a bound oc depends on the dynamics and evolution of neighbouring clusters and specially of the wr153ab star .",
    "sbb3 hosts the wr152 star of type wn3(h)-w , a mass of 12m@xmath6 and mass loss rate @xmath13(m@xmath6/yr)=-5.5 ( @xcite ) .",
    "since wr152 has a relatively low mass for a wr star ( the minimum initial mass for a star to become a wr at solar - metallicity is 25m@xmath6 ) it can explode as supernova without evolving through the wc type , expulsing gas and dissolving the star cluster very early .",
    "two possible destinations are suggested for the central clusters of sh2 - 132 :    1 .",
    "given the proximity among these clusters , a merger may occur , which would generate a more massive oc .",
    "as a consequence this cluster would appear dynamically older than the evolution of its stars indicates , that is , with mass segregation more advanced than expected ( @xcite ) .",
    "2 .   alternatively ,",
    "the dissolution of the clusters , as a consequence of residual gas expulsion , stellar evolution and dynamics of the trapezium system . in this case , trap900 might leave a compact fossil remnant .",
    "we report the discovery of 4 star clusters ( here referred to as sbb1 , sbb2 , sbb3 and sbb4 ) in the area of the sh2 - 132 complex .",
    "these clusters and two previously catalogued ones ( teutsch127 and berkeley94 ) were analyzed with 2mass photometry and show evidence that the sh2 - 132 complex is a site of triggered star formation , as suggested by its hierarchical structure and age distribution of the star clusters .",
    "the presence of gas and dust bubbles reinforces this idea .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee for constructive comments and suggestions . we acknowledge support from the brazilian institution cnpq .",
