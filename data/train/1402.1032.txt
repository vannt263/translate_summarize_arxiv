    "the @xmath5-process operates during the he and c burning stages of stellar evolution at temperatures between 0.1 and 1 gk ( equivalent to thermal energies from @xmath9 to 90 kev ) . for the determination of the effective neutron capture rate in a stellar environment , the energy differential ( @xmath6 ) cross section @xmath10 has to be known over a wide energy range up to several hundred kev . folding the differential cross section with the thermal maxwell - boltzmann spectrum yields the maxwellian averaged cross section ( macs ) characteristic of the stellar environment .    with an isotopic abundance of 68% ,",
    "@xmath0ni is among the prominent members of the fe abundance peak and represents a secondary seed isotope for nucleosynthesis in the @xmath5-process .",
    "the solar ni abundance has been produced along with the fe - peak elements by core - collapse supernovae of massive stars @xcite as well as by thermonuclear supernovae of type ia @xcite in complete nuclear statistical equilibrium during @xmath11-rich freeze - out . according to spectroscopic observations at different metallicities , about 70% of the solar ni",

    "several measurements of the @xmath0ni ( @xmath6 ) cross section are available in exfor @xcite , but only few extend over a wide astrophysically relevant neutron energy range .",

    "the present work was motivated by the sizable differences between the experimental cross section data of @xmath0ni @xcite , aiming at a high - resolution measurement from thermal to about 400 kev neutron energy .",
    "the radiative neutron capture cross section of @xmath0ni was measured at the neutron time of flight facility n_tof at cern . at n_tof",
    " one of the most luminous neutron sources presently available  neutrons are produced by an intense pulsed beam of 20 gev/@xmath13 protons impinging on a massive cylindrical pb target .",
    "typical beam conditions are a repetition rate in multiples of 1.2 s and a proton pulse width of 7 ns . on average ,",
    "300 neutrons are produced per proton , resulting in a total of @xmath14 neutrons per pulse .",
    "besides 1 cm layer of water used for cooling the pb target , 4 cm layer of borated water is used for moderating the initially fast neutrons .",
    "the final neutron spectrum spans the energy range from thermal to several gev .",
    "the production of 2.2 mev @xmath15-rays from radiative neutron capture on hydrogen is also minimized by using borated water as the main moderator .",
    "although strongly suppressed by the borated water , the thermal neutron component still ensures a significant capture yield .",
    "an evacuated beam line is connected to the spallation target and moderator .",
    "neutrons , charged particles and intense @xmath15-radiation outside the beam line are attenuated by the massive concrete walls and 3.5 m thick iron shielding .",
    "the charged particles from inside the beam line are removed by a 1.5 t sweeping magnet .",
    "the neutron beam is shaped by collimators at 137 and 178 m from the spallation target .",
    "the aperture of the second collimator was 19 mm , corresponding to the capture mode of the n_tof facility . behind the experimental area , at about 185 m",

    "the scintillation liquid was contained within the cylindrical compartment of 618  ml for bicron and 1027  ml in case of fzk .",
    "these volumes were low enough to provide sufficiently low @xmath15-ray detection efficiency , required for detecting no more than one @xmath15-ray from @xmath15-ray cascades emitted in the neutron capture reactions .",
    "the detectors were mounted 8.2 cm upstream of the sample to reduce the effect of in - beam @xmath15-rays , and at a distance of 6.8 cm from the center of the neutron beam line .",
    "c@xmath12d@xmath12 detectors are characterized by exceptionally low neutron sensitivity .",
    "the use of carbon fiber for the evacuated beam line and for the supports further minimized the probability for neutron capture by the experimental apparatus itself . in this manner the neutron sensitivity of the experimental setup  which can be defined as the ratio @xmath22 between the efficiency @xmath23 for detecting scattered neutrons ( through secondary @xmath15-rays produced by their interaction in the experimental area ) and the efficiency @xmath24 for detecting capture events  was kept as low as manageable .",

    "a memory buffer of 48 mb allows us to measure up to 96 ms in neutron time - of - flight , corresponding to a neutron energy of 20 mev .",

    "the energy calibration of the c@xmath12d@xmath12 detectors was performed with @xmath30cs , @xmath31y and am / be calibration sources , which were also used to verify the stability of the detector response during the 32 days of the experiment .",
    "in addition , the energy resolution of the two c@xmath12d@xmath12 detectors was assessed from these calibration data .",
    "the time - of - flight to energy calibration , that is the determination of the fixed flight path length , was based on the analysis of @xmath32au resonances , according to the method described in ref .",

    "the well - established pulse height weighting technique , originally proposed by maier - leibnitz @xcite , was applied to the recorded signals .",
    "this procedure ensures that the efficiency @xmath24 of a detector is independent of the de - excitation pattern of the capture @xmath15-ray cascade .",
    "this condition is achieved by off - line modification of the detector response so that it becomes proportional to the detected @xmath15-ray energy : @xmath33 .",

    "the spectra @xmath36 were obtained by a detailed geant4 simulation . within the simulation code the experimental setup of the two c@xmath12d@xmath12 detectors and the surrounding apparatus were described in detail .",
    "thus the simulation takes into account the intrinsic and geometrical efficiency for detecting @xmath15-rays as well as secondary effects such as absorption of @xmath15-rays in the sample and the detection of photons scattered by the nearby components .",
    "simulated monochromatic spectra were folded with the experimentally determined energy resolution of the two c@xmath12d@xmath12 detectors .",

    "an important remark concerns the presence of a direct capture ( dc ) and direct - semidirect ( dsd ) capture @xcite component .",
    "theoretical calculations @xcite predict that such a component plays an important role at low energy in this isotope . in particular , s - wave neutrons , characterized by an energy dependence close to @xmath76 behavior , may account for more than 30% of the thermal cross section value , while a much smaller contribution is expected for p - wave neutrons at higher energy .",
    "it should be considered that the low energy dc and dsd components can be accounted for by the negative energy resonances , as essentially done in the evaluations . in the present work , since the capture yield was determined with good accuracy down to thermal neutron energy , and a reasonable global fit was obtained from thermal energy to a few kev , it was not necessary to consider in the macs an additional contribution of the s - wave dc or dsd capture component , calculated from theoretical models , as done in ref .",
    "we remark that , although conceptually different , the two methods used for the determination of this non - resonant component in the macs are practically equivalent .",
    "the only missing correction regards the dc component of p - wave neutrons .",

    "the present results confirm guber s results around @xmath3 = 30 kev , a temperature domain of special importance for the stellar nucleosynthesis .",
    "however , for temperatures above 70 kev the n_tof results show a deviation larger than 5% relative to guber s data .",

    "50 kev range the latest endf / b - vii.1 evaluation is clearly favored . above 50 kev",
    "the n_tof results lie between the values predicted by both libraries . since all other major libraries essentially reproduce the evaluations in endf / b - vii.0 , the n_tof results call for a revision of the @xmath0ni capture data in those data libraries . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the available macss from kadonis v0.3 compilation @xcite are also shown .",
    "the plotted data are listed in table [ tab4 ] for all @xmath3 values found in kadonis v0.3 database .",
    "both the statistical and systematic uncertainty in the macs have been obtained by error propagation , starting from the values reported for the resolved and unresolved resonance region .",
    "systematic uncertainties are the same as those for the systematic uncertainty of kernels .",
    "the impact of our new results on the @xmath5-process was studied with a full 25m@xmath159 stellar model with an initial metal content of @xmath160 = 0.02 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5-process nucleosynthesis is provided by the post - processing nugrid code mppnp @xcite .",
    "the final abundance distribution exhibits an effect that is essentially limited to the abundance of @xmath0ni itself . due to the smaller macs values compared to kadonis v0.3 , @xmath0ni is less efficiently depleted , leading to a 60% higher final abundance in the @xmath5-processed material",
    ". however , the overall effect of the new @xmath0ni values on the @xmath5-process abundance pattern is marginal , mostly because the @xmath0ni abundance is much smaller ( 4.3% @xcite ) compared to the dominant @xmath161fe seed .",
    "the radiative neutron capture cross section of @xmath0ni has been measured in a wide energy range from 27 mev up to 400 kev , taking advantage of the high instantaneous neutron flux available at the n_tof facility at cern , together with the low neutron sensitivity of two liquid c@xmath12d@xmath12 scintillation detectors . analyzing the high - resolution capture",

    "@xcite within @xmath3 = 10  60 kev range .",
    "the decrease of the new macs causes an increase of 60% of the final @xmath5-process abundance of @xmath0ni .",
