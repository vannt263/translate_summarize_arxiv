    "according to the hoop - conjecture @xcite , a cosmic string that contracts to a size smaller than its schwarzschild radius will collapse and form a black hole .",
    "this process is of particular interest and importance in connection with primordial black holes , hawking radiation , high energy cosmic gamma bursts etc .    in a network of cosmic strings , only a very small fraction , @xmath1 , of strings are expected to collapse to black holes .",
    "many attempts have been made to obtain a value for @xmath1 ( see for instance @xcite-@xcite ) , but the results deviate wildly .",
    "interestingly enough , only in one of the pioneering papers on the subject , the one by polnarev and zembowicz @xcite , is the derivation of @xmath1 based on exact analytical expressions for the cosmic strings involved in the process . in all other discussions the derivation of @xmath1",
    "is based on linearized expressions for the string configurations ( for instance @xcite ) , rather general arguments and estimates ( for instance @xcite ) , observational data concerning high energy cosmic rays ( for instance @xcite-@xcite ) or the derivation is purely numerical ( for instance @xcite ) . and even in ref .",
    "@xcite , the final computation of @xmath1 is actually numerical , although it could in fact have been performed analytically .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the question of collapse for the analytical two - parameter family of strings introduced by turok @xcite .",
    "this is the same family of strings that was considered in @xcite .",
    "however , simple explicit examples show that the results obtained in @xcite are correct only in part of the parameter - space",
    ". we will show that some essential points were missed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and that the results obtained there are not completely correct .",
    "first of all , we make a classification of the string configurations according to their general behavior during one period of oscillation .",
    "together with some simple explicit examples , this analysis reveals that the corresponding result obtained in @xcite is in fact only correct in approximately half of the two - dimensional parameter - space .",
    "secondly , we then derive the exact analytical expression for the probability @xmath1 of string collapse to black holes .",
    "our result for @xmath1 agrees partly with that of ref .",
    "@xcite in the sense that @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the string tension and @xmath4 is newtons constant . however , we find a numerical prefactor in the relation , expressed in terms of euler s gamma - function , which is of the order @xmath5 . for comparison , in ref .",
    "@xcite the prefactor was found ( numerically ) to be of the order @xmath6 .",
    "finally we show that our careful computation of the prefactor helps to understand the discrepancy between previously obtained results and , in particular , that for  large \" values of @xmath0 , there may not even be a discrepancy .",
    "we also give a simple physical argument that can immediately rule out some of the previously obtained results .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec2 ]",
    ", we introduce the string configurations of turok @xcite and discuss the results obtained by polnarev and zembowicz @xcite . in section [ sec3 ] ,",
    "we give the precise definition of the minimal string size @xmath7 , and we make a complete classification of the two - dimensional parameter - space .",
    "the classification is in terms of the specific time(s ) at which the value @xmath7 comes out for a particular string configuration during one period of  oscillation \" . in section [ sec4 ]",
    ", we derive an exact analytical expression for the probability of string collapse to black holes and we give the approximate result in the physically realistic limit @xmath8 . finally in section [ sec5 ] , we argue that our careful computation of the prefactor helps to understand the discrepancy between previously obtained results , and we give our concluding remarks .",
    "some of the details of the computations used in sections [ sec3 ] and [ sec4 ] are presented in the appendix .",
    "the string equations of motion in flat minkowski space take the form : @xmath9 supplemented by the constraints : @xmath10 it is convenient to take @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a constant with dimension of length .",
    "( [ waveeq])-([gaugefix ] ) become : @xmath13 a two - parameter solution to eqs .",

    "this family of solutions generalizes the solutions considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the total mass - energy of the turok - string is:@xmath17 where:@xmath18 it follows that : @xmath19 which ( by construction ) is independent of the parameters ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "similarly , one finds for the momenta : @xmath21 in fact , the string center of mass is located at @xmath22 at all times , and the strings are symmetric under reflection in origo.the schwarzschild radius corresponding to the energy ( [ stringenergy ] ) is @xmath23 for realistic cosmic strings , the dimensionless parameter @xmath0 is quite small @xcite , say @xmath24 .",
    "it is then clear that a turok - string ( [ turokstring ] ) will typically be far outside its schwarzschild radius ( as follows since typically @xmath25 ) .",
    "however , for certain particular values @xmath26 , a string might at some instant during its evolution be completely inside its schwarzschild radius .",
    "such a string will collapse and eventually form a black hole , according to the socalled hoop - conjecture @xcite . to determine whether this happens or not , we must first find the minimal 3-sphere , that completely encloses the string , as a function of time .",
    "after minimization over time , we then get the minimal 3-sphere that can ever enclose the whole string .",
    "let the radius of this sphere be @xmath7 ( it will be defined more stringently in the next section ) .",
    "then the condition for collapse is : @xmath27 that is to say , @xmath28    in a pioneering paper , polnarev and zembowicz @xcite considered , among other things , the question of collapse of the turok - strings ( [ turokstring ] ) .",
    "in connection with the minimal string size @xmath7 they found :    * the strings have their minimal size @xmath7 at @xmath29 * for generic parameters @xmath30 : @xmath31",
    "the result ( [ polz1 ] ) would be expected for a string experiencing a monopole - like oscillation , i.e. starting from maximal size at @xmath32 , then contracting isotropically to minimal size at @xmath33 , and then re - expanding to its original maximal size at @xmath34 . as for the result ( [ polz2 ] )",
    "it was simply stated @xcite without proof or derivation .    in sections 3,4",
    "we shall show that ( [ polz1 ] ) and ( [ polz2 ] ) are not completely correct .",
    "in fact , they are correct in part of the two - dimensional parameter - space but incorrect in other parts . a simple example showing that ( [ polz2 ] ) can not be correct , is provided by the case @xmath35 . in that case the result ( [ polz2 ] ) would actually give @xmath36 , which would mean that the whole string had collapsed to a point at some instant .",
    "this would imply that at some instant @xmath37 , but that is certainly impossible for @xmath38 .",
    "the problem is that ( [ polz2 ] ) gives the minimal distance from origo to the string , but it is the maximal distance which is relevant for the minimal 3-sphere .",
    "for a given pair of parameters ( @xmath39 ) , we define the minimal string size @xmath40 as the ( square of the ) radius of the minimal 3-sphere that can ever enclose the string completely .",
    "more precisely : @xmath41 \\end{array } \\left [ \\begin{array}{cc } \\mbox{maximum}\\\\ \\sigma\\in\\left[0 ; \\pi\\right ] \\end{array } \\left(r^2\\left(\\tau , \\sigma\\right)\\right)\\right ] \\label{defr}\\ ] ] where : @xmath42 as obtained using eq .",
    "( [ turokstring ] ) .",
    "thus , for a fixed time @xmath43 , we first compute the maximal distance from origo ( i.e. the string center of mass ) to the string .",
    "this gives the minimal 3-sphere that encloses the string at that particular instant .",
    "we then minimize this maximal distance over all times .",
    "this gives altogether the minimal string size @xmath40 . and",
    "this is obviously the quantity that must be compared with the ( square of the ) schwarzschild radius @xmath44 .",
    "notice that we need only maximize over @xmath45 $ ] and minimize over @xmath46 $ ] in eq .",
    "( [ defr ] ) .",
    "this is due to the reflection symmetry and time periodicity of the turok - strings ( [ turokstring ] ) .",
    "+ we now outline the computation of @xmath40 . the details can be found in the appendix , and some analytical results are given also in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "we first solve the equation : @xmath47 for fixed time @xmath43 .",
    "this leads to a quartic equation in @xmath48 : @xmath49 where the coefficients @xmath50 depend on time @xmath43 as well as on the parameters @xmath51 .",
    "the explicit expressions are given in the appendix .",
    "the solutions to equation ( [ quartic ] ) are explicitly known , leading to @xmath52 for given values of @xmath51 . by insertion of these solutions",
    "@xmath53 into @xmath54 , it is then straightforward to obtain the maximal distance in the square bracket of eq .",

    "this is now a function of @xmath43 , which finally has to be minimized over @xmath46 $ ] . for more details ,",
    "see the appendix and section [ sec4 ] .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "1 , that is , the minimal string size @xmath40 as a function of ( @xmath55 ) . not surprisingly , the minimal string size is generally of the order 1 ( in units of @xmath12 ; see eq .",
    "( [ turokstring ] ) ) .",
    "the exception is in the vicinity of @xmath56 , where the minimal string size is close to zero .",
    "this was also to be expected since the vicinity of @xmath57 describes the near - spherical strings , and those are the only ones expected to have a chance to collapse , due to their relatively small angular momentum .",
    "these strings will be considered in detail in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "however , the computation of the minimal string size @xmath40 gives some more information about the turok - strings , namely the time(s ) @xmath43 at which the strings are minimal .",
    "this gives rise to a precise classification of the turok - strings , and a subsequent subdivision into 3 different families ( see fig .",
    "2 ) : + * i*. these strings have their minimal size at @xmath58 .",
    "that is , starting from their original size at @xmath43 = 0 , they generally contract to their minimal size at @xmath58 , and then generally expand back to their original size at @xmath59 . +",
    "* ii*. these strings start from their minimal size at @xmath43 = 0",
    ". then they generally expand towards their maximal size and then recontract towards their minimal size at @xmath59 . + * iii*. these strings have their minimal size at two values of @xmath43 symmetrically around @xmath60 .",
    "that is , they first generally contract and reach the minimal size at some @xmath61 $ ]",
    ". then they expand for a while , and then recontract and reach the minimal size again at @xmath62 .",
    "then they expand again towards the original size at @xmath59 . in this family of strings ,",
    "the value of @xmath63 depends on @xmath64 .",
    "+   + it must be stressed that the strings in most cases do not expand or contract _ isotropically_. they typically expand in some directions while contracting in other directions .",
    "this is why we use the expressions  generally expand \" and  generally contract \" , which refer to the minimal string size as a function of time ( the radius of the minimal 3-sphere enclosing the string , as a function of time ) .",
    "notice that besides the three above - mentioned families of strings , there are a number of degenerate cases at the different boundaries .",
    "for instance , at the boundary @xmath65 , the strings have their minimal size at @xmath32 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath59 . on the other hand , at the boundary between regions",
    "* i * and * ii * , the strings have their minimal size at @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath59 .",
    "notice also that the 3 points @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 correspond to rigidly rotating strings , thus they have their minimal ( and maximal ) size at @xmath71 times .",
    "+ let us close this section with a comparison with the result ( [ polz1 ] ) of ref . @xcite .",
    "we see that the result ( [ polz1 ] ) is correct in the region * i * of parameter - space , but incorrect in regions * ii * and * iii*. +",
    "in this section we consider the question of collapse of the turok - strings ( [ turokstring ] ) . as already discussed in the previous section , the only strings with a chance to collapse are those corresponding to parameters @xmath64 located in the vicinity of @xmath72 .",
    "that is , we need only consider strings in the family * i * of fig .",
    "2 . using the results of the appendix , it is then straightforward to show that the minimal string size @xmath40 , as defined in eq .",

    "the integrals in ( [ prob ] ) are of hyper - elliptic type @xcite , and not very enlightening in the general case . however , using that typically @xmath87 ( see @xcite ) , a simple approximation is obtained by keeping only the leading order terms : @xmath88 the result ( [ approxprob ] ) is a very good approximation for @xmath89 , thus for any  realistic \" cosmic strings we conclude : @xmath90 which is our final result of this section .    it should be stressed that we have been using the simplest and most naive version of the hoop - conjecture : namely , we did not take into account the angular momentum of the strings .",
    "however , numerical studies @xcite of other families of strings showed that inclusion of the angular momentum only leads to minor changes in the final result , so we expect the same will happen here .",
    "it should also be stressed that we have neglected a number of other physical effects that might change the probability of collapse .",
    "these include the gravitational field of the string and gravitational radiation .    finally , as in all other discussions of the probability of string collapse ,",
    "we are faced with the problem that we do not know the measure of integration in parameter - space . thus using another measure in eq .",
    "( [ prob ] ) would generally give a different result ( see also ref .",
    "in this paper we examined , using purely analytical methods , the question of collapse of turok s two - parameter family of cosmic strings @xcite .",
    "we made a complete classification of the strings according to the specific time(s ) the minimal string size is reached during one period .",
    "this revealed that the previously obtained results @xcite were only correct in part of the two - dimensional parameter - space .",
    "we then obtained an exact analytical expression for the probability @xmath1 of collapse into black holes for the turok strings , which partly agrees with that of ref .",
    "@xcite in the sense that @xmath2 .",
    "however , we showed that there is a large numerical prefactor in the relation .",
    "this factor is of the order @xmath5 , and not , as previously stated @xcite , of the order @xmath6 .",
    "one might say that it is perhaps not so important whether the prefactor is @xmath6 or @xmath5 since the exponent will more or less kill the probability of collapse anyway .",
    "this may very well be true for  small \" values of @xmath0 ( say , @xmath24 ) , but for  large \" values of @xmath0 ( say , @xmath91 ) the situation is completely different .",
    "in fact , we shall now argue why it is so important to carefully compute the prefactor : we find that when using our result , a clear picture is beginning to emerge .",
    "different computations based on different families of strings ( not surprisingly ) produce slightly different exponents , but they also produce completely different prefactors .",
    "importantly , the two go in the same direction : an exponent larger by @xmath6 is followed by a prefactor larger by a factor @xmath92 ( roughly speaking ) .",
    "for instance , the one - parameter family of kibble and turok @xcite gives @xmath93 , our computation for the two - parameter family gives @xmath94 and the caldwell - casper computation @xcite gives @xmath95 .",
    "we find it extremely interesting that for @xmath96 ( which is the range where the caldwell - casper computation is valid ) , the three computations basically agree giving @xmath97 .",
    "we therefore find that our careful computation of the prefactor is very important and has helped to understand the discrepancy between previously obtained results . and",
    "in particular , for  large \" values of @xmath0 , there may not even be a discrepancy since the different exponents and prefactors of the different computations actually produce more or less the same number for the probability of collapse .",
    "for  small \" values of @xmath0 , the picture is unfortunately not so clear , and more detailed investigations seem necessary .",
    "it is actually possible to give a physical argument showing that the results of different computations ( if they are done correctly ) should merge for  large \" values of @xmath0 .",
    "consider the rigidly rotating straight string , corresponding to @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "it is easy to show that it is precisely inside its schwarzschild radius for @xmath100 .",
    "now , it is well - known that the rigidly rotating string has the maximal angular momentum per energy ( it is exactly on the leading regge trajectory ) , and therefore is expected to be the most difficult string to collapse into a black hole . therefore , for @xmath101 all other strings have already collapsed , and we should expect @xmath102 .",
    "this is indeed the case for the three above mentioned computations , while it does not hold for the computation of ref.@xcite .",
    "more generally , the condition @xmath103 can be considered as a physical boundary condition , and therefore can be used to immediately rule out some of the previously obtained results for @xmath1 ; for instance those of @xcite and @xcite .    as a possible continuation of our work",
    ", it would be very interesting to consider more general multi - parameter families of strings , to see how general our result for @xmath1 actually is .",
    "such families of strings have been constructed and considered for instance in @xcite , and more general ones can be obtained along the lines of @xcite .    unfortunately , there are also still some open questions , as we discussed at the end of section [ sec4 ] .",
    "the main problem seems to be that we still do not know exactly what is the measure of integration in parameter - space @xcite .",
