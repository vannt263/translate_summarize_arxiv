    "in the past decades , the mechanisms of the conductivity through the superconductor - insulator - normal metal ( sin ) tunnel interface have been extensively studied . due to the superconducting energy gap @xmath1 in the quasiparticle density of states , the current through such an interface is generally suppressed at low temperatures , @xmath2 , and subgap bias voltages , @xmath3 , giving rise to a low - voltage nonlinearity in the @xmath4-curve @xcite . recently",
    "this , the most common property of sin - contacts has been found to be rather useful , e.g. , for reducing generation of quasiparticles by building the current shunts into the josephson - junction qubits @xcite or for avoiding an extra decoherence @xcite in all - josephson rsfq - qubit integrated systems @xcite .    in particular , the thermal noise produced by",
    "the resistively shunted josephson junctions in a standard rsfq - circuitry , brings into being an additional source of qubit decoherence @xcite .",
    "it was shown however that this effect can be minimized , by using the nonlinear damping that is provided by an sin - junction of low asymptotic resistance , @xmath5 , and a high value of the nonlinearity parameter @xmath6^{-1}$ ] , where @xmath7 is the zero - bias conductivity of the shunt .",
    "the dynamics of sin - shunted josephson junctions has recently been analyzed in detail on the basis of a standard tunnelling model of the sin - junction ( see ref .",
    "the feasibility was demonstrated to ensure both a high damping at the characteristic josephson frequency @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the characteristic voltage and @xmath10 the critical current , and , due to the high impedance of the sin - junction at subgap voltages , a sufficiently low noise at qubit frequencies of typically up to @xmath11{ghz } \\ll \\delta / h $ ] .",
    "the first experiments on sin - shunted nb sis josephson junctions @xcite have proven the feasibility of the overdamped regime at @xmath12{k}$ ] . at the same time , however , an unexpectedly weak subgap nonlinearity of the sin - junctions was observed . in particular , the value of @xmath13 , measured at @xmath14{k}$ ] in an sin - junction with a specific tunnel resistance of @xmath15{\\omega \\times \\mu m^2}$ ] , was much smaller than the values @xmath16 which are typical of opaque barriers ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , and also far below the simple estimates made for the tunnelling model , yielding a large subgap suppression factor @xmath17 @xcite . in view of the previous data",
    ", it would be an even more challenging task to achieve a high nonlinearity in sin - junctions of very low specific resistance , e.g. , @xmath18{\\omega \\times \\mu m^2}$ ] for the sin - junctions based on superconducting al @xcite , as required for rsfq operation at qubit temperatures @xmath19{mk}$ ] .",
    ", as measured in a 4-point configuration.,width=307 ]    in this paper , we address subgap conductance phenomena in sin - junctions of very high transparency .",
    "in particular we found that the degree of nonlinearity of the measured @xmath4-curves is consistent with predictions of the two - electron tunnelling model which has been developed in a ballistic regime by blonder , tinkham and klapwijk ( btk ) @xcite and modified by hekking and nazarov @xcite to account also for interference contributions due to coherent electron diffusion . in earlier experiments ,",
    "the spatial coherence was clearly demonstrated by pothier _",
    "@xcite in the form of a periodical dependence of the low - bias conductance of the so - called ns - quid interferometer on the magnetic flux .",
    "a spatially coherent enhancement of the two - electron tunnelling amplitude makes the junction conductance topology - dependent .",
    "this effect was observed as _ zero - bias conductance anomaly _ in a thin - film planar ns - interface , which was compared in ref .",
    "@xcite with the btk ballistic transport through an edge - type ns - contact . in our experiment , we compare the values of the nonlinearity parameter @xmath20 for different junction topologies , varying the junction sizes and/or the width of the adjacent diffusive electrode . we show that a sufficiently strong nonlinearity can be obtained in submicron sin - contacts with even high - transparency barriers , i.e. in the case of interest for rsfq - qubit applications .",
    "two techniques were applied for fabricating the samples . the large reference junctions `` nbaupd '' and `` nbal '' ( see table  [ sampa ] ) were made in a standard sandwich technique which is usually applied for rsfq - devices ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) , on the basis of a nb trilayer , patterned with the help of optical lithography .",
    "both samples had a sophisticated multilayered structure which made a particular analysis of the sin - junction component difficult .",
    "for example , the junction `` nbal '' consisted of the metal stack with a pronounced proximity effect between the aupd and the top nb layers , and , possibly , between the bottom nb and the covering al , separated by a thin oxide barrier only .",
    "these nb - based samples were characterized in a he@xmath21-cryostat at temperatures down to @xmath22{k}$ ] .",
    "the data for these two samples , shown in table  [ sampa ] , represent our rough estimations .    for the sake of simplicity and flexibility of the design ,",
    "all other junctions were fabricated by means of dolan s shadow evaporation process @xcite .",
    "the complete structures were deposited _ in - situ _ from the e - gun through the single e - beam - patterned pmma / ge / copolymer mask with free - hanging bridges .",
    "the junctions were formed on the overlapping areas of the first and the subsequent shifted layers , deposited through the same openings in the mask but at different tilting angles of the wafer in respect to the incident material flow .",
    "the @xmath4-curves were measured at @xmath23{k } $ ] in a dilution refrigerator .",
    "the bottom layer of all shadow - evaporated junctions was made of aluminum , with a thickness of @xmath24{nm}$ ] , and oxidized in a very mild regime ( see below ) to form a thin tunnel barrier . to be able to put several different structures on the same chip",
    ", we used besides a two - layer also a three - layer design , with cu- , cu / cu- or al / cu - layers building the top electrodes of the junctions .",
    "the junctions `` sintop '' and `` sinbot '' were simple two - layer structures with the tunnel areas differing by the factor of two , both oxidized for 5 min at an oxygen pressure of @xmath25{pa}$ ] , which resulted in a specific barrier resistance @xmath26{\\omega \\times \\mu m^2}$ ] .",
    "a somewhat more complicated layout was used for the junctions `` 1l1f '' to `` 2l4f '' which were fabricated on the next wafer .",
    "the top junction electrode was made either of a single layer [ _ the top _ cu film in the `` 1lxx''- junctions , see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig1](a - c),(e ) ] or of a double - layer composition [ a composition of _ the middle and the top _ cu films in the `` 2lxx''-junctions , see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) ] , evaporated in two consecutive steps , with an additional tilting of the wafer in between .",
    "accordingly , two different thicknesses of the top electrodes , @xmath27{nm}$ ] and @xmath28{nm}$ ] , were obtained .",
    "this wafer was oxidized for 5 min at lower pressure , @xmath29{pa}$ ] , in order to obtain an even more transparent barrier .",
    "although all junctions had the same al bottom layer with the same oxidation step , two different values of @xmath30 were found : @xmath31{\\omega \\times \\mu m^2}$ ] for the `` 1lxx''-junctions , and @xmath32{\\omega \\times \\mu m^2}$ ] for the `` 2lxx''-junctions .",
    "a similar effect was observed for the samples `` sisn '' and `` sisnsin '' . in our opinion , this variation is specific to low - dose oxidation processes and arises due to a prolonged oxidation of the al by adsorbed oxygen in the areas which are not being covered by the middle layer of cu .",
    "the junctions `` 1l2f '' to `` 2l4f '' , `` sisn '' and `` sisnsin '' were designed in a `` split - finger '' layout [ see figs .",

    "the neighboring fingers of cu formed , together with the superconducting al sections , the closed loops of the area @xmath35{\\mu m^2}$ ] .",
    "in contrast to the other samples , the normal metal electrodes in the junctions `` 1l1fmin '' and `` 1l2fmin '' were made in a special `` electron confinement '' shape [ fig .",
    "[ fig1](e ) ] : the width of the adjacent wire was reduced further to 1/4 of @xmath34 while the tunnel area was kept identical to that in the samples `` 1l1f '' and `` 1l2f '' , respectively .",
    "the top electrode of junctions in the samples `` sisn '' and `` sisnsin '' , both fabricated on the same wafer , consisted of two different metals , al and cu , which formed slightly shifted shadows in such a way that , in the sample `` sisn '' , the junction was designed to be effectively of type `` superconductor - insulator - superconductor '' with a proximity - reduced gap ( sis ) . in the sample `` sisnsin '' , the junction of the same total area was made up of such an sis to the half with an al / oxide / cu sin - contact ( see the cross - sections in fig .

    "as expected , significant subgap leakage currents were observed in most of the sin - junctions , even at the temperature @xmath36{mk } \\ll \\delta / k_{\\text b}$ ] , resulting in a strong smearing of the superconducting gap corner and in rather moderate values of @xmath37110 ( see table  [ sampa ] ) .",
    "the appreciable excess subgap current at low temperatures is commonly attributed to the resonant two - electron transport channel due to andreev reflection @xcite . to interpret our data ,",
    "we first make estimations within the simplified ballistic btk model , which put aside the electron scattering effects in the electrodes . using eq.(17 ) of @xcite , it is straightforward to derive simple expressions for the subgap conductance at @xmath38 : @xmath39\\left [ { 1 + 2z^2 } \\right]^2 } } \\ ] ] and the btk nonlinearity parameter : @xmath40^{-1 } = \\frac{{\\left ( { 1 + 2z^2 } \\right)^2 } } { { 2(1 + z^2 ) } } , \\ ] ] whereby the dimensionless barrier strength @xmath41 @xcite characterizes the transparency of the ns interface , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the fermi energy and wavenumber , respectively and @xmath45 enters the phenomenological repulsive barrier potential @xmath46 . for a thin tunnel barrier of the simplest , rectangular shape with a height @xmath47 and a thickness @xmath48 , which is the fermi wavelength , @xmath41 can be expressed as @xmath49 , ~   \\kappa   = k_{\\rm f } \\sqrt { \\frac{u - \\epsilon _ { \\rm f } } { \\epsilon _ { \\rm f}}}\\ ] ] by matching the well - known plane - wave transmission coefficient ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) with that of btk , @xmath50 , which is provided in ref .",

    "whereas the asymptotic slopes of all three samples are similar , the zero - bias resistance of the sample `` 1l4f '' , which is the one with the narrowest wires and junctions , exceeds @xmath51 of the other samples noticeably , indicating the geometric effect for the two - electron conductance . the small kicks on both , positive and negative branches of the @xmath4-curves around @xmath52 arise due to self - heating effects in the junctions ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "important corrections can be made to the calculations if we take a note of the fact that the barriers under consideration are as thin as a single monolayer of al oxide .",
    "the value of @xmath60 accepted above presents an average barrier thickness of the plane junction with the specific capacitance @xmath61{ff/\\mu m^2}$ ] ( derived from the coulomb offset voltage of the similarly oxidized single - electron transistors @xcite , cf . also @xcite ) , and the dielectric constant @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "for such thin oxide layers , it is plausible to expect considerable local deviations of the relative barrier thickness , even for the cleanest tunnel interface .",
    "possible models for the fine structure of very thin barriers have recently been discussed for junctions of type nb / alo@xmath63/nb with current densities in a wide range , @xmath64{ka / cm^2}$ ] @xcite . in refs .",

    "our argument is that small , but finite values , @xmath66 , corresponding to our experimental value @xmath67 ( see fig .",
    "6 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , rather relate to the picture of a thin , but finite tunnel barrier , at least on the mesoscopic scale @xmath68 . moreover , on the microscopic scale @xmath69",
    ", the ballistic transport model accounting for the pinhole effects is not adequate ; the relevant approach here relates to the electron diffraction , which makes the tunnelling picture non - local @xcite .    to build a quantitative model",

    "the effective zero - bias nonlinearity can then be found as the ratio @xmath72 of the average asymptotic @xmath73 and the zero - bias conductivities @xmath74 : @xmath75 best matching the experimental range of @xmath76  27 in al - based sin junctions for @xmath77  0.80.9 , i.e. , for the realistic barriers with a thickness of up to two oxide monolayers .",
    "so far we have been able to obtain a reasonable , though rough , estimation of the zero - bias nonlinearity of sin junctions within the scope of the ballistic btk model .",
    "a more detailed insight can be gained , by comparing the subgap transport properties in sin junctions of the same transparency but of different size .",

    "[ fig1](b , c ) ] .",
    "all three structures have the same total tunnel area and , therefore , similar asymptotic resistances , but they differ with regard to the number @xmath78 and the width @xmath34 of the partial junctions . in none of the split - finger interferometer structures , a periodic dependency of the @xmath4-curves on the magnetic field was observed , which indicates the absence of inter - junction coherence effects such as those reported earlier for different structure dimensions by pothier _ et al . _ @xcite .",
    "this property of our structures is obviously due to the normal - metal sections of each loop being , in total , longer than the interference length in a diffusive conductor @xmath79{\\mu m}$ ] @xcite and , when used in practice , it makes damping on the base of the split - finger sin - junction flux insensitive .",
    "independent tunnelling in the sub - junctions enables a parallelization of the sin - contacts , when a low shunting resistance is required .    for the larger junctions `` 1l1f '' and `` 1l2f '' , with @xmath80{\\mu m}$ ] ,",
    "the value of @xmath81 does not vary with the junction width . on the contrary , for the parallel connection of the four smaller , @xmath82{\\mu m}$]-wide sub - junctions in sample `` 1l4f '' , the value of @xmath83 is nearly twice as large .",
    "the same tendency is to be seen for the samples `` 2l2f '' and `` 2l4f '' with slightly different parameters ( see table  [ sampa ] ) .",
    "the observed dimensional effect can be interpreted following the model of hekking and nazarov @xcite which accounts for spatially coherent contributions to the andreev conductance due to two - electron diffusion . according to this model , the coherence factors , and thus the subgap conductance ,",

    "a strong current reduction was found at voltages below @xmath92 ( cf . also @xcite ) , resulting in larger values of @xmath93 and 52 in the samples `` sisn '' and `` sisnsin '' , respectively .",

    "the layer of al was originally considered in this structure to form a normal - metal electrode whereas the `` s '' electrode was a proximity superconductor built of an aupd / nb bilayer",
    ". however , much higher subgap nonlinearity than in the other sin - junctions indicates , in our opinion , that the al electrode has a spectrum of states which differs from that of a normal metal .",
    "for example , a small gap could be induced in al by the bottom film of nb through a very transparent separating tunnel barrier , making the junction effectively an sis type .",
