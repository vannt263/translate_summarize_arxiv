    "the antlia galaxy cluster has long been overlooked in optical studies despite the fact that it is the nearest cluster after virgo and fornax , with a comparable number of members and total mass as the latter @xcite .",
    "its central part consists of two subgroups , each dominated by one of the giant elliptical galaxies ngc3258 and ngc3268 .",
    "this particular structure makes it an even more interesting target , as evidence for interactions between the galaxies in the central cluster region may emerge .",
    "however , large differences in the radial velocities between ngc3268 and several close and bright neighbours suggest a considerable structural depth . we have performed the first ccd study of the stellar population in ngc3258 and ngc3268 (",
    "* hereafter paperi ) , where the existing literature on the antlia cluster is summarized .",
    "afterwards , our study of the galaxy content of this cluster @xcite , revealed the presence of numerous low surface brightness galaxies , that had not been identified in a former photographic search carried out by @xcite .    in paperi , the luminosity and colour profiles of ngc3258 and ngc3268 , and of their globular cluster systems ( gcss ) ,",
    "were studied on the basis of wide - field washington photometry .",
    "both gcss show bimodal colour distributions , but small number statistics prevented the detection of any difference between the radial profiles of the two globular cluster ( gc ) subpopulations . unfortunately , these data were not deep enough to reach the turn - over magnitudes of the respective gcs luminosity functions , which can be used as distance indicators , and it was not possible to estimate new distances .",
    "the sbf distances determined by @xcite are the only ones available , besides a distance estimation via the hubble flow @xcite .",
    "a recent study of gcss in eight brightest cluster galaxies by @xcite includes both antlia ellipticals .",
    "on the basis of ( @xmath2 ) photometry obtained with the acs / wfc camera from the hubble space telescope ( field of view of @xmath3 arcmin@xmath4 ) , they focus on the two - colour data and metallicity distributions .",
    "harris et al .",
    "confirm our results from paperi that the gc colour distributions in these antlia galaxies are bimodal .",
    "they found a trend in the sense that brightest blue gcs seem to become redder with increasing luminosity . with regard to the radial projected distribution , harris et al .",
    "also show that red gcs are more centrally concentrated than blue ones .    in this new investigation with vlt data ,",
    "we determine gc luminosity functions ( gclfs ) and , through their turn - overs , the distance estimates for the dominant antlia ellipticals .",
    "we study the characteristics of the different gc subpopulations in each galaxy , and compare them to the galaxies light profiles .",
    "the total gc populations are also calculated .",
    "in addition , the gcss near the giant elliptical galaxies are compared to the cluster population in a field further away , about 100kpc from both galaxies ( the ` intracluster ' field ) .",
    "one goal of this comparison is to search for intracluster gc candidates , i.e. , gcs that may be unbound to a parent galaxy , but are instead moving freely in the potential well of the cluster ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section 2 describes the observations , the adopted criteria for the gc candidates selection , and the completeness and reddening corrections . in section 3",
    "we analyse the results from the four observed fields and perform the distance calculations .",
    "section 4 deals with the galaxies properties , and sections 5 and 6 with those of their gcss",
    ". a discussion of the results is presented in section 7 and , lastly , the conclusions and a summary are provided in section 8 .",
    "bessel @xmath5 and @xmath6 imaging was obtained for four fields in the antlia cluster during 2003 march 2728 , with fors1 at the vlt ut1 ( antu ) telescope ( cerro paranal , chile ) .",
    "this camera is equipped with a @xmath7 pixels@xmath4 ccd chip , which provides an image scale of 0.2arcsecpixel@xmath8 and a field of view of @xmath9 arcmin@xmath4 ( about @xmath10 kpc@xmath4 at the antlia distance ) .",
    "the positions of the fields are shown in fig.[fig : fields ] and basic data are listed in table[tab : fields ] .",
    "the labels of the fields ( see fig.[fig : fields ] ) were selected as follows : ` ngc3258 ' and ` ngc3268 ' for those that are located on the dominant galaxies , ` intracluster ' for the field placed in between them , and ` background ' for the field located close to the border of the mosaic field , used to correct for the contamination by the background .",
    "for the four fields , three images with exposure times of 100/200s each plus five images with exposure times of 300/700s each were obtained in the @xmath5/@xmath6 bands , respectively . in all cases , short exposures of 10s",
    "were also taken to avoid saturation problems .",
    "the seeing was excellent ( table[tab : fields ] ) .",
    "mosaic image that has been used in paperi .",
    "north is up and east to the left.,width=317 ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the ellipticity of the gcs can be determined studying the azimuthal density distribution of gc candidates with respect to the azimuthal angle , that is , a position angle measured from north to east .",
    "an elliptical gcs causes sinusoidal counts in this diagram : the ellipticity @xmath11 and the number density along the major and the minor axis ( @xmath12 ) are related via @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the exponent of the radial density distribution ( @xmath15 ) .    in the upper panel of fig.[fig : azi ] the azimuthal distribution of the ngc3258 gcs is shown for clusters within 0.52arcmin . a sinusoidal fit to the data results in an ellipticity @xmath16 and a pa of the major axis @xmath17 , which are in excellent agreement with those obtained in paperi .",
    "within 0.52arcmin for ngc3258 ( upper panel ) and for ngc3268 ( lower panel ) .",
    "the dotted lines show the sinusoidal fits .",
    ", width=317 ]      we have shown that red and blue clusters have different radial distribution , hence the colour distribution shows a radial dependence which is shown in fig.[fig : colour58 ] . in particular , the presence of red gcs is less noticeable in the outer cluster sample .",
    "we have fitted two gaussians to the histogram data .",
    "we find for the inner sample ( @xmath18 arcmin ) : @xmath19 and for the outer sample ( @xmath20 arcmin ) : @xmath21 no radial dependence of the peak positions can be observed up to our limit in galactocentric radius , that is , about 45kpc .",
    "this result is consistent with the observations in other ellipticals within similar radial ranges @xcite . in this way ,",
    "the radial dependence of the colour distribution may be basically explained by the different proportions of the blue and red subpopulations .",
    "we have also tested the colour distribution within different luminosity ranges : bright ( @xmath22 ) , intermediate ( @xmath23 ) and faint ( @xmath24 ) samples ( the figure is not shown because it is similar to the ngc3268 one depicted in fig.[fig : colour68a ] ) . for the intermediate and faint samples it is possible to fit two gaussians .",
    "these results show that the blue and red peaks for these luminosity ranges agree with the colours obtained for all gcs together , within the errors ( table[tab : kmm ] ) . however , the red peak of the fainter sample is redder than the red of the intermediate sample ( @xmath25 / @xmath26 , and @xmath27 / @xmath28 , for blues / reds in the intermediate and faint samples , respectively ) .    for the brighter sample ,",
    "it is not possible to fit two gaussians but only one .",
    "the peak colour obtained ( @xmath29 ) is somewhat intermediate between both gc populations .",
    "this behaviour has already been detected in other ellipticals that dominate galaxy clusters like , e.g. , ngc1399 @xcite , and the sample of eight brightest cluster galaxies from @xcite .",
    "fig.[fig : radial68 ] shows the radial density profiles of all gcs , red and blue ones , for the candidates brighter than @xmath5=25 in ngc3268 . in this case , the profiles can be well described by power - laws or by devaucouleurs profiles .",
    "all fits were performed within the range 0.65arcmin and the results are depicted in table[tab : radialdistr ] .",
    "the profile obtained from the mosaic data for this gcs has been included in the upper panel , where the difference between the vlt and mosaic profiles in the inner region is due to radial incompleteness effects within 0.7arcmin ( see fig . 6 in paperi ) .",
    "the slopes of all devaucouleurs fits for all gcs ( red and blue ) agree within the errors with those of the ngc3258 fits . as in the ngc3258 gcs ,",
    "red clusters have a more concentrated distribution than blue clusters .",
    "it is apparent from fig.[fig : radial68 ] that the innermost point of the blue gcs profile deviates from the expected position , which is probably due to an underestimation of the completeness correction .",
    "neither the blue or red gc radial density profiles show any feature that can be understood as the spatial limit of the gcs .",
    "however , the red profile shows that the zero density level will be reached at a galactocentric radius slightly larger than 5arcmin .",
    ".,width=317 ]    the galaxy surface luminosity profile shown in fig.[fig : radial68 ] is well traced by the red gcs , but the slope is clearly different from that of the blue gcs profile .",
    "the azimuthal number counts of the gcs within 0.52arcmin are shown in the lower panel of fig.[fig : azi ] , from which we derive an ellipticity @xmath30 and a position angle @xmath31 .",
    "the errors in both parameters are large because the fit is affected by a clear excess in the gc azimuthal distribution , at azimuthal angles between 200250 .",
    "this excess appears in coincidence with one of the maxima of the sinusoidal fit , and at azimuthal angles that correspond to the direction towards ngc3258 .",
    "it is interesting to note that on the sky , the position angle with origin in ngc3258 that points to the direction of ngc3268 , is 39 .",
    "so we confirm the results from paperi , that both gcss are elongated in a direction close to an axis joining the two galaxies .",
    "the gc colour distribution is shown in fig.[fig : colour68a ] for three luminosity intervals , within the radial range 0.72.3arcmin . as for ngc3258 ,",
    "the brightest gcs show a unimodal colour distribution while fainter gcs have bimodal distributions .",
    "the distribution also extends to redder colours as we consider fainter gcs .",
    "the two - gaussian fits show that the blue and red peaks , for the intermediate and faint luminosity ranges , agree with the colours obtained for all gcs together , within the errors ( table[tab : kmm ] ) . however , the red peak of the fainter sample is clearly redder than that of the intermediate sample ( @xmath29 / @xmath32 , and @xmath33 / @xmath34 , for blues / reds in the intermediate and faint samples , respectively ) .",
    "similar trends are present in the ngc3258 gcs .",
    "the peak colour obtained from the single - gaussian fit to the brightest sample ( @xmath35 ) is roughly in between both subpopulations .",
    "the colour distributions within different galactocentric radii have also been tested within an inner and outer samples as for ngc3258 .",
    "we confirm the radial dependence of the colour distribution because the fraction of red gcs present in the outer sample is smaller than in the inner one .",
    "the colours of the blue / red peaks roughly agree , within the errors , with the ones estimated for the whole gc population , but in this case the peaks of the inner sample are redder than those of the outer group ( @xmath36 / @xmath37 , and @xmath38 / @xmath39 , for blue / red peaks in the inner and outer samples , respectively ) .",
    "the principal property of the colour distribution of gcs , the bimodality , has been previously found to be absent among the bright gcs of ngc1399 @xcite and m87 @xcite .",
    "@xcite found the same in their acs photometry of several central giant ellipticals , including our antlia galaxies , while this point remained unclear in our previous washington photometry .",
    "unimodal colour distributions , seem to apply to clusters brighter than approximately @xmath40 .",
    "our present photometry reiterates on this finding , shifting the limit between bimodality and unimodality even a bit lower to @xmath41 .",
    "it is plausible ( and discussed in the literature , see the reviews of @xcite and @xcite ) that there are several possible formation channels for creating a population of very bright clusters .",
    "stripped galactic nuclei @xcite , former blue compact galaxies , but also `` normal '' formation of massive clusters , perhaps through the merging of smaller subclusters @xcite are viable candidates or formation histories , which in the center of a galaxy cluster might occur more frequently than in less dense environments .",
    "we can estimate the gc populations performing a numerical integration of the devaucouleurs radial density profile , which includes gcs brighter than @xmath5=25 , and doubling the result according to the toms of the gclfs .",
    "the external limiting radius of the gcss is taken as @xmath42 = 10arcmin following paperi . in this way ,",
    "the total gc population of ngc3258 amounts to @xmath43 and that of ngc3268 @xmath44 . in ngc3258 ,",
    "the red gcs are clearly less numerous than the blues , being the ratio of blues to reds @xmath45 , which is close to the ratio estimated from the colour distribution @xmath46 , within the errors ( see table[tab : kmm ] ) .",
    "the ratio of blue to red gcs around ngc3268 is @xmath47 , also close to the ratio derived from the colour distribution @xmath48 ( table[tab : kmm ] ) .    in order to calculate the specific frequency @xmath49 ( as defined by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of both gcss , we need the @xmath5-band absolute magnitudes of the host galaxies and number of gcs estimated over the same galactocentric distance .",
    "the @xmath50-band integrated luminosities of the galaxies up to @xmath42 = 4arcmin can be obtained from paperi and corrected by absorption in @xmath50 applying the relation from @xcite @xmath51 and the @xmath52 colour excesses depicted in table[tab : fields ] .",
    "we can not estimate global @xmath49 due to the large uncertainties of the integrated luminosity at larger radii , but we are able to improve the @xmath49 from paperi ( also within @xmath42 = 4arcmin ) through a more precise determination of the number of gcs . by means of the individual distance moduli estimated in this paper and the colour index @xmath53 ( paperi ) for both galaxies ,",
    "we obtain absolute luminosities within 4arcmin @xmath54 for ngc3258 , and @xmath55 for ngc3268 , where the errors are calculated with the errors of the apparent magnitudes and of the distance moduli .",
    "the corresponding gc populations , up to the same radius , are estimated by numerical integration of the radial density profiles .",
    "finally , the specific frequencies within @xmath42 = 4arcmin are @xmath56 for ngc3258 , and @xmath57 for ngc3268 . due to the limited radial range of these calculations ,",
    "these @xmath49 should be taken as indicative values .",
    "the derived distances indicate that ngc3258 is located somewhat in the foreground with respect to ngc3268 .",
    "the toms , taken at face value , suggest a difference of 6 mpc , while the sbf distances are different by 3 mpc , although the uncertainties would not exclude the same distance .",
    "an additional argument is that the ` intracluster ' field independently reveals a tom intermediate between ngc3258 and ngc3268 which we expect if the outskirts of the respective gcss are projected onto each other .",
    "this interpretation is also not without oddities .",
    "ngc3258 has an unusually high specific frequency considering its brightness and , if really in the foreground , would be in a relatively poor environment , at least poorer than that of ngc3268 .",
    "such a high frequency is , however , not unique as we see from the case of ngc4636 @xcite , but extraordinary .",
    "a distance modulus of 0.4 mag higher would decrease its specific frequency by a factor of 1.4 , making it more common . on the other hand ,",
    "its tom is very well sampled , better than that of ngc3268 , so we do not think that the tom is grossly erroneous .",
    "a few remarks to the group around ngc3268 : the radial velocities of the three neighbour galaxies that are listed in paperi ( ngc3269 , ngc3271 , ngc3267 ; these are the only ones for which radial velocities are available ) , are consistently higher by about 1000 km / s .",
    "the morphological appearance suggests ngc3268 to be the central galaxy of that subgroup of the antlia cluster .",
    "these radial velocities , however , let it appear improbable that ngc3268 is at rest with respect to that group .",
    "its `` normal '' specific frequency also would not qualify it as a `` central '' galaxy .    more insight into the structure of the antlia cluster",
    "can only be expected by a radial velocity survey .      with regard to the presence of gcs inside galaxy clusters that are not bound to individual galaxies , observational evidence of their existence",
    "have been presented , among others , by @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "besides , numerical simulations on their formation and properties have been performed by @xcite .        in the previous sections we have derived the cluster radial density distribution and fitted devaucouleurs laws to the gcss of ngc3258 and ngc3268 .",
    "we now take these fits , extrapolate them beyond the observed 5arcmin , and compute the combined cluster density along the connecting axis between the two galaxies .",
    "the results for all gcs , as well as for reds and blues , are shown in fig.[fig : intergal ] , where ngc3258 and ngc3268 would be on the right and left sides , respectively .",
    "the ` intracluster ' field is located on this connecting axis , and we aim at comparing the observed densities in this field with the combined extrapolated profile , along this connecting line . for this reason ,",
    "the gc densities for five different radial ranges within the ` intracluster ' field , completeness corrected and background subtracted , are determined taking a limiting magnitude @xmath5 = 25 .",
    "the observed densities follow closely the individual extrapolated density profiles ( filled circles in fig.[fig : intergal ] ) . however , number statistics are low as all densities in this field , observed and extrapolated , are below 5gcsarcmin@xmath58 .",
    "we scaled the mosaic densities to those of the vlt fields , which are shown in the upper panel of fig.[fig : intergal ] . on the ` intracluster ' field",
    ", the combination of the extrapolated fitted functions seems to predict a higher cluster density than the observed one .    if there were some intracluster gcs one would expect the observed density in the ` intracluster ' field to be larger than just the sum of the individual gcs extrapolated profiles .",
    "the contribution of red gcs is almost negligible , so the analysis is performed basically on the blue ones . along the axis connecting both galaxies ,",
    "the range of the observed ( blue gc ) densities is @xmath59arcmin@xmath58 while the range of combined ( blue gcs ) extrapolated densities , within the same radii , is @xmath60arcmin@xmath58 .",
    "though we are dealing with poor number statistics these results suggest that not only the observed densities are not larger than the predicted ones , but they even tend to be smaller .",
    "so far , we do not find from our data any conclusive evidence of the existence of intracluster gcs in the region between ngc3258 and ngc3268 .",
    "however , it should be taken into account that the ` intracluster ' field , where there are gcs contributed by both gcss , has not turn into a proper place to seek for them .",
    "we are undertaking a kinematic study of the gc and galaxy content of the antlia cluster , that will probably help to detect their presence in this cluster .",
    "on the basis of fors1/vlt ( @xmath61 ) images we have performed an analysis of the globular cluster systems of ngc3258 and ngc3268 , the dominant elliptical galaxies of the antlia galaxy cluster .",
    "our first study of these gcss was based on washington ( @xmath62 ) photometry and wide - field mosaic images ( paperi ) , which did not reach the turn - over magnitude ( tom ) of the globular cluster luminosity function ( gclf ) . here",
    "we summarize the results and conclusions :    * the toms of the red , the blue , and the total populations are obtained by fitting gaussians to the respective gclfs .",
    "the distance moduli , obtained from the entire gc sample , are @xmath63 for ngc3258 and @xmath64 for ngc3268 , which are in good agreement with those obtained by @xcite via the sbf method .",
    "the toms of the blue gcs are on the average @xmath65 = 0.4 mag brighter than those of the red ones . *",
    "the gclf was independently determined for a field between ngc3258 and ngc3268 .",
    "we could measure a tom of @xmath66 ( blue gcs ) , intermediate between the toms of the bright galaxies .",
    "this supports the view that we are observing the overlapping of the two gcss .",
    "the actual number density is even somewhat lower than from one would expect by the extrapolation of the number density profiles determined near the host galaxies .",
    "we therefore found no evidence of the presence of intracluster gcs in the field between the ellipticals . *",
    "the total gc populations are about @xmath0gcs in ngc3258 and @xmath1gcs in ngc3268 while the extent of both gcss is at least 10arcmin ( about 90 kpc )",
    ". if the relative distances are correct , this corresponds to specific frequencies of @xmath67 for ngc3258 and @xmath68 for ngc3268 .",
    "* other findings from paperi like the bimodal colour distribution or the azimuthal distributions have been confirmed .",
    "the galaxy light profiles match more closely the red gcs radial density profiles .",
    "a point not addressed in paperi is the unimodal colour distribution of the brightest clusters .",
    "the strongest indication so far for the spatial proximity of ngc3268 and ngc3258 was the common radial velocity of 2800 km / s .",
    "but the gclf distance moduli rather suggest that ngc3268 is located somewhat in the background , separated from ngc3258 by several mpc .",
    "the unusually high specific frequency of ngc3258 is , however , a rare finding and would ease with a distance equal to that of ngc3268 . a further confirmation",
    "would therefore be required .",
    "much evidence suggests that antlia is a cluster in a very early stage of dynamical evolution , but the spatial and dynamical relationship of its components are still unclear .",
    "we started a kinematic study intending to bring more clarity in the understanding of the apparently complex structure of antlia .",

    "<S> we present a deep vlt photometry in the regions surrounding the two dominant galaxies of the antlia cluster , the giant ellipticals ngc3258 and ngc3268 . </S>",
    "<S> we construct the luminosity functions of their globular cluster systems ( gcss ) and determine their distances through the turn - over magnitudes . </S>",
    "<S> these distances are in good agreement with those obtained by the sbf method . </S>",
    "<S> there is some , but not conclusive , evidence that the distance to ngc3268 is larger by several mpc . </S>",
    "<S> the gcss colour distributions are bimodal but the brightest globular clusters ( gcs ) show a unimodal distribution with an intermediate colour peak . </S>",
    "<S> the radial distributions of both gcss are well fitted by devaucouleurs laws up to 5arcmin . </S>",
    "<S> red gcs present a steeper radial density profile than the blue gcs , and follow closely the galaxies brightness profiles . </S>",
    "<S> total gc populations are estimated to be about @xmath0gcs in ngc3258 and @xmath1gcs in ngc3268 . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the possible existence of gcs in a field located between the two giant galaxies ( intracluster gcs ) . </S>",
    "<S> their luminosity functions and number densities are consistent with the two gcss overlapping in projection .    </S>",
