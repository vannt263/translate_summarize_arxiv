    "in @xcite , the first analysis of particle creation process of black - holes in drgt massive gravity was performed .",
    "the analysis done in @xcite used the hawking method studied in @xcite , but in an implicit way .",
    "this means that the extra - degrees of freedom were not studied explicitly , but rather they appeared implicitly inside the definitions of extended coordinates ( stckelberg functions ) .",
    "this method just take the advantage of the fact that the extra - degrees of freedom appear in a similar way as the coordinate transformations in general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "this is just the well known stckelberg trick applied at the non - linear level . in @xcite ,",
    "the path integral formulation was explored .",
    "in such a case , the analysis of the periodicity of the poles of the propagator revealed the possibility of an extra component of radiation coming from the extra - degrees of freedom of the theory .",
    "this extra - component , is relevant at scales where the extra - degrees of freedom are important .",
    "if we take the origin of coordinates on the source , this happens for distances larger than the vainshtein radius @xmath1 and only observers defining the time in an arbitrary direction with respect to the stckelberg function ( @xmath2 ) are able to detect it . on the other hand",
    ", observers defining the time in agreement with @xmath2 will not be able to perceive the additional contribution to the hawking result and all their measurements of temperature and particle creation process are reduced to the gr case . although the result found in @xcite is general , in such a case the author did not evaluate explicitly the new value of temperature .",
    "this value will depend on how the periodicity of the propagator is affected by the presence of the extra - degrees of freedom .",
    "the calculations performed by using the path integral method , are simplified if we work by defining the stckelberg functions in agreement with the extended versions of the advanced and retarded coordinates as has been done in @xcite . in the extended version of the coordinates ,",
    "the stckelberg function denoted by @xmath2 appears in replacement of the time - coordinate . in this manuscript ,",
    "i study the particle creation process of black - holes by using the path - integral formulation .",
    "i explore the analyticity properties of the propagator inside the non - linear formulation of massive gravity proposed by de - rham , gabadadze and tolley ( drgt ) .",
    "the general result suggests that for stckelberg functions given by @xmath3 , with @xmath4 having some non - linear time - dependence , the periodicity properties of the poles of the propagator change and the effect of the extra - particle creation is evident .",
    "the dynamical metric in this case is however , non - stationary .",
    "if @xmath4 has a linear time - dependence , then the properties of the poles of the propagator are also affected and the stationary condition of the dynamical metric would be satisfied .",
    "these general situations are not explored in this manuscript . here",
    "i concentrate the analysis on the black - hole solution found in @xcite for the case @xmath5 , with @xmath6 and @xmath7 representing two free parameters of the theory .",
    "this combination of parameters is special because it provides a solution with zero cosmological constant ( @xmath8 ) and a non - zero graviton mass .",
    "then it is easier to analyze the effect of the extra - degrees of freedom at large scales .",
    "similar solution was found in @xcite .",
    "the stationary condition of this solution , guarantees that the stckelberg function is linear in time and given by @xmath9 , with @xmath10 representing a spatial dependent function carrying the information of the extra - degrees of freedom .",
    "here @xmath10 is time - independent .",
    "then after analytical extension of the time - coordinate @xmath0 , the effect of the function @xmath10 , is to create a shift effect for the poles of the propagators if we compare them with respect to the gr case .",
    "in addition , if we express the extended version of the kruskal coordinates as an explicit function of time @xmath0 , then after the analytical extension of the time - coordinate , the periodicity of the poles of the propagator is given by @xmath11 , with @xmath12 depending on the free - parameters of the theory .",
    "the relation @xmath13 marks the possibility of having a branch point condition .",
    "the order of the branch point is given by @xmath14 and it depends on the value taken by the parameters of the theory . for the case",
    "@xmath5 , the order of the branch point becomes zero when @xmath15 .",
    "it is infinite for @xmath16 and in general is finite for other values taken by the parameter @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath17 ( when @xmath18 ) , the periodicity of the propagator is the same as in the gr case , however the shift of the poles of the propagators produced by the function @xmath10 in this particular case , although does not affect the value of temperature with respect to the gr case ( for the case @xmath17 ) , it affects the space - time locations where the observers detect particles . in other words , if an observer moving under the theory of gr travels through a line of constant @xmath19 , then he will disagree with the instants ( of time ) at which the particles appear if he compare his results with the observers describing the physics in agreement with the drgt theory of massive gravity .",
    "this is equivalent to a time - dilation effect reproduced by the extra - degrees of freedom at large scales . for the case of the branch points ,",
    "when they become of order zero or infinite order , the effect of particle creation coming from the black - hole is completely suppressed for the observers describing this kind of solutions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ( [ eq : final1 ] ) , i make a brief review of the schwarzschild de - sitter solution inside the non - linear formulation of massive gravity ; this solution is discussed in detail in @xcite . in section ( [ eq : pathspart ] ) , i make a brief review of the path integral formulation applied to the analysis of the particle creation process of black - holes .",
    "this analysis was originally proposed by hartle and hawking @xcite .",
    "section ( [ eq : non - linearstu ] ) is dedicated to explore the non - linear version of the stckelberg trick .",
    "the idea is to explain the distinction between coordinate transformations and the stckelberg trick .",
    "from the perspective of gr , the stckelberg trick looks like a dipheomorphism transformation . inside drgt massive gravity , this is not the case . in section ( [ eq : analitycity ] ) , i explore the analyticity properties of the propagator .",
    "this is the key section of the manuscript . in section ( [ eq : blackrad ] ) , i explain the expected modifications for the black - hole radiance due to the extra - degrees of freedom of the theory for the case @xmath5 .",
    "this section explores the connection between the rates of emission and absorption .",
    "finally , in section ( [ eq : con ] ) , i conclude .",
    "in @xcite , the s - ds solution can be written explicitly as :    @xmath20    where :    @xmath21    and @xmath22 , with @xmath23 being the scale factor which depends on the free - parameters of the theory . in this previous solution ,",
    "all the degrees of freedom are inside the dynamical metric .",
    "the fiducial metric in this case is just the minkowskian one given explicitly as :    @xmath24    the solution ( [ eq : drgt metric ] ) can be equivalently written as :    @xmath25    where @xmath2 corresponds to the stckelberg function .",
    "this function contains the information of the extra degrees of freedom in agreement with the formulation introduced in @xcite .",
    "the metric ( [ eq : drgt metric2 ] ) is then diffeomorphism invariant @xcite .",
    "the gravitational degrees of freedom of the stckelberg fields appear inside @xmath2 through the spatial ( temporal ) dependence of the function . for the family of solutions with two free - parameters and the stckelberg function constrained as has been found in @xcite ,",
    "the cosmological constant is given by @xcite :    @xmath26    this constant is zero when the two free - parameters of the theory @xmath7 and @xmath6 satisfy the relation @xmath5 .",
    "independent of the relation between the two free parameters of the theory , the stckelberg function has to satisfy the constraint @xcite :    @xmath27    a global solution of this previous constraint , is given by the finkelstein - type form @xcite :    @xmath28",
    "the path integral method in gr , was introduced by hartle and hawking in @xcite . here",
    "i will use the same method in order to derive the results of the hawking radiation in massive gravity and then analyze the possible contributions coming from the extra - degrees of freedom . in the feynman path integral method ,",
    "the amplitude @xmath29 for a particle to propagate from a point @xmath30 to another point @xmath31 , is given by :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is just the classical action for a particular path connecting @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the amplitude @xmath29 is called propagator . in fig . ( [ fig:1 ] ) , we can observe the analytically extended schwarzschild space .",
    "the shaded part of the diagram should be replaced by a gravitationally collapsing object .",
    "the path @xmath34 , represents the process of a pair of particles being created at the point @xmath35 .",
    "one of the particles propagates forward in time and reach the point @xmath36 , where an observer with a detector is located .",
    "the other particle propagate backwards in time , reaching eventually the future singularity at @xmath37 .",
    "there are two kind of observers in drgt massive gravity .",
    "the first one defines the time in agreement with the stckelberg function @xmath2 .",
    "this observer will not see any difference between gr and the drgt formulation of massive gravity .",
    "this observer can not detect any contribution coming from the extra - degrees of freedom of the theory .",
    "the second kind of observer , defines the time arbitrarily in agreement with @xmath0 . in general",
    ", the directions of the killing vectors defined in agreement with @xmath2 and @xmath0 , will disagree .",
    "when this happens , we have the possibility of extra - particle creation process due to the extra - degrees of freedom of the theory .",
    "in general metric solutions , the extra - particle creation process will emerge from the time - dependence ( @xmath0 ) of the stckelberg function . in the stationary case with @xmath10 being time - independent , which is the one explored in this manuscript ,",
    "the stckelberg function is linear with respect to @xmath0 and there are two effects that will appear still at this level .",
    "the first one is the branch point condition reproduced by the factor @xmath12 appearing in the metric components ( [ eq : drgt metric ] ) .",
    "the second effect is the shift of the poles of the propagator with respect to the gr case , even if @xmath17 . later in this manuscript",
    ", i will explain in detail both effects . for the moment",
    ", i will define the path integral method and i will explain how can it be applied to the drgt massive gravity case . here",
    "i do not consider the paths coming from @xmath38 , because they correspond to propagation of incoming particles from the infinite past . here",
    "i will assume that the infinite past does not contain any degree of freedom .",
    "the paths corresponding to the shaded region are ignored , since they correspond to the collapsing object itself .",
    "the propagation is then considered from the future singularity . if we want to use the stationary phase method in order to derive the particle creation process , we immediately find that it is impossible to find real stationary paths connecting the future singularity with a positive - frequency mode for a stationary exterior observer @xcite .",
    "then we have to analytically extend the path toward the past singularity , or equivalently , we have to translate the point @xmath37 on the future singularity to complex values .",
    "this is equivalent to relate the rate of emission to the rate of absorption of the black - hole after thermodynamic equilibrium is reached .",
    "mathematically , the connection is @xcite :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 and @xmath41 correspond to the probability emission and absorption respectively . here @xmath42 is the surface gravity of the black - hole , which in the standard case of gr becomes @xmath43 . in massive gravity , some modification is expected for observers located at scales larger than @xmath1 if they define their corresponding time - like killing vectors with respect to the usual notion of time coordinate .",
    "if we want to apply the path integral method for the analysis of black - holes in gr to the drgt case , the stckelberg function plays the role of the time - coordinate as has been explained in @xcite .",
    "then the time - coordinate @xmath0 , will appear implicitly inside this function .",
    "this is equivalent to use the stckelberg trick at the non - linear level explained in the coming section .",
    "the coming section will require to use the stckelberg trick in order to reproduce the important results related to the hawking radiation inside the non - linear formulation of massive gravity .",
    "at the non - linear level , the trick looks like the dipheomorphism transformations in gr . in unitary gauge ( with a fiducial metric being minkowski ) , it can be expressed as @xcite :    @xmath44    where @xmath45 are the components of the stckelberg functions . the previous equation looks like a standard gauge transformation in gr .",
    "it is however , the way of introducing redundant variables in order to restore the dipheomorphism invariance of the massive action in massive gravity .",
    "the redundant variables contain the information of the extra - gravitational degrees of freedom . under the dipheomorphism transformations given by :    @xmath46    the metric ( [ eq : gmunu ] ) is invariant .",
    "this is necessary for keeping the massive action invariant .",
    "infinitesimally , the stckelberg function expansion :    @xmath47    provides the following result on the metric ( [ eq : gmunu ] ) :    @xmath48    the gauge transformations ( [ eq : gt ] ) , after the infinitesimal expansion @xmath49 , become :    @xmath50    @xmath51    the @xmath52-term corresponds to the goldstone bosons that at the non - linear level carry the broken symmetry in massive gravity .",
    "it can be verified again that under the previous infinitesimal gauge transformations , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ob ] ) provides the result :    @xmath53    which demonstrates that the dynamical metric with the stckelberg functions appearing explicitly is dipheomorphism invariant .",
    "if we want to derive the analyticity properties of the propagator , the easiest way is by using the stckelberg trick , already explained in the previous section .",
    "the trick permits us to define the stckelberg function in terms of new objects which can be considered as extended coordinates .",
    "the basic idea is to replace the standard time - coordinate @xmath0 by the use of the stckelberg function @xmath2 inside this new objects .",
    "we can then define the components of the stckelberg functions as extended coordinates . here",
    "we start with the basic differential definition of the propagator given by :    @xmath54    with the appropriate boundary conditions . in drgt massive gravity ,",
    "the condition @xmath5 is equivalent to the schwarzschild solution ( asymptotically flat ) , but with some background of stckelberg fields .",
    "inside the schwarzschild geometry , we will consider the case where @xmath31 is external to the black - hole and @xmath30 is over the horizon as in the standard case .",
    "if the vainshtein mechanism operates , as it is expected from these solutions , then the extra - degrees of freedom effects will become relevant after the vainshtein scale and then the time coordinate orientation selected by the observer becomes important for the vacuum definition and as a consequence , for the definition of temperature . as has been explained before , for observers defining the time in agreement with @xmath2 , the perceived radiation will not change with respect to the gr case @xcite . on the other hand , for observers defining the time in the standard way , the effect of the extra - degrees of freedom will appear and they will generate changes in the periodicity pattern for the poles of the propagator .",
    "we can define the kruskal coordinates in drgt by using the stckelberg trick .",
    "they are defined as @xcite :    @xmath55    with :    @xmath56    where the stckelberg fields components are defined as :    @xmath57    @xmath58    and @xmath2 is the initial stckelberg function .",
    "the objects ( [ eq : adv ] ) and ( [ eq : adv35678 ] ) are the new stckelberg functions .",
    "they can also be defined as extended coordinates inside the drgt formulation .",
    "note that the condition ( [ eq : condo ] ) is not affected by the presence of the extra - degrees of freedom of the theory ( drgt ) because the initial stckelberg function ( @xmath2 ) does not appear in the final result .",
    "in fact , whenever we find time - independent quantities defined originally inside the framework of gr , when extended to the drgt case , will not be affected by the presence of the extra - degrees of freedom in spherically symmetric configurations .",
    "only time - dependent quantities as they are defined originally inside the framework of gr , will suffer some changes when they are extended to the drgt case . the definition of event horizon taken from the combination of stckelberg function components in eq .",
    "( [ eq : condo ] ) is unchanged with respect to the gr case .",
    "then the event horizon is defined with the condition @xmath59 or @xmath60 , when @xmath61 .",
    "this can also be verified from the metric ( [ eq : drgt metric ] ) , then the event - horizon position will not be affected by the presence of the extra - degrees of freedom .",
    "the complexified horizon in this case , is defined as the surface where the non - zero of the coordinates @xmath62 or @xmath63 is extended analytically to complex values .",
    "any singularities for the propagator will come from the point @xmath64 as in the standard case @xcite . by dividing the interval of @xmath65 as in @xcite ,",
    "the propagator becomes :    @xmath66    where @xmath67 corresponds to the propagator of the interval @xmath68 $ ] for the parameter @xmath65 with @xmath69 being infinitesimal and near the divergence point of the propagator .",
    "we can observe that there is a singularity as @xmath70 .",
    "in massive gravity , the extra - degrees of freedom are contained inside this condition if we take into account the stckelberg trick as has been formulated in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gmunu ] ) .",
    "then in terms of the stckelberg function , this result corresponds to a null geodesic , connecting @xmath31 with the complexified manifold .",
    "when expressed explicitly in terms of the standard time coordinate @xmath0 , this previous null condition contains some extra - terms ( stckelberg fields ) which will modify the analyticity properties of the propagator .",
    "all the geodesics starting from real values of @xmath31 , will intersect the horizon at real sections , namely , sections where the extended versions of @xmath63 and @xmath62 are real .",
    "we can consider the geodesics which connect a real value of @xmath31 which is outside the black - hole with the future event horizon .",
    "then we can define again new stckelberg functions by extending the notion of the advanced eddington - finkelstein coordinates in agreement with ( [ eq : adv ] ) , covering @xmath71 :    @xmath72    with @xmath73 representing the extended version ( stckelberg function ) of the advanced - null coordinates @xmath74 . here",
    "at this point of the calculation , we have two options .",
    "the first one is to work by using @xmath73 as the killing time .",
    "in such a case , we will obtain exactly the same results of gr .",
    "this corresponds to the observers defining the vacuum in agreement with @xmath2 .",
    "the second option , is to use @xmath76 as the killing time , defining then eq .",
    "( [ eq : this one ] ) as :    @xmath77    it is possible for some observers to define the vacuum in agreement with @xmath78 , namely , the usual time - coordinate . by complexifying the geodesics assuming an imaginary affine parameter @xmath79 ,",
    "then the geodesic would be a two - dimensional sheet in the complex coordinate system and then from eq .",
    "( [ eq : this one ] ) , we know that for complex extensions of @xmath73 , there is a periodicity associated to the coordinate @xmath63 and given by @xmath80 or :    @xmath81    note however that if we use the coordinate @xmath78 as the killing time , then any dependence on @xmath78 coming from the function @xmath82 , will affect the periodicity properties of the complexified variable @xmath78 . for stationary solutions with @xmath10 being independent of @xmath78 , like the one explored in this manuscript , the periodicity structure of the propagator still can be affected by a couple of effects that can appear due to the presence of extra - degrees of freedom .",
    "these effects will be explained later in detail .",
    "what is important for the moment is to note that the periodicity associated with the variable @xmath73 , can be different to the one associated to the variable @xmath78 . by convenience ,",
    "we select the strip which contains real values of @xmath63 .",
    "we suppose that for some affine parameter @xmath83 , the coordinates ( and stckelberg functions ) take the values @xmath84 , which are assumed to be real .",
    "then we can study which complex values of the extended coordinate ( stckelberg function ) @xmath73 in the strip with real values of @xmath61 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are contained inside the two - dimensional sheet generated by the null geodesics .",
    "it is clear that the two - dimensional sheet generated by the complex values of @xmath73 , when expressed in terms of @xmath78 , will in general contain some arbitrary combinations of the complex values of @xmath78 and @xmath82 , depending on the specific form of the stckelberg function @xmath87 . by extending the method proposed by hartle and hawking @xcite , the singularities of the propagator on the complexified horizon",
    "are slightly displaced from the real values of u and v. they correspond to the poles marked by @xmath88 , which are infinitesimal displacements with respect to the real values on the complexified horizon .",
    "the direction of the displacements , can be found in the same way as hartle and hawking did @xcite .",
    "the analyticity properties of the propagator suggests that the periodicity of the poles will change with respect to the gr case for observers taking the time in agreement with @xmath0 defined in an arbitrary direction with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "observers defining the time in agreement with @xmath2 , will not perceive any change in the periodicity of the poles of the propagator .",
    "for these special observers , there is no difference with respect to the gr case .",
    "we can define stckelberg functions in agreement with the extended null - coordinates @xmath62 and @xmath63 defined as :    @xmath89    with the ( initial ) stckelberg function @xmath2 playing the role of an extended notion of time .",
    "the results ( [ eq : munsang ] ) are valid for the cases @xmath90 and @xmath91 . on the other hand",
    ", we also have :    @xmath92    for the cases @xmath93 and @xmath91 .",
    "analogous relations can be found for the other quadrants of the extended penrose diagram .    .",
    "taken from @xcite.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in the diagram ( [ fig : momoko ] ) , the region @xmath94 has the cauchy data over part of the future horizon and part of the past horizon .",
    "then the initial data over these surfaces , determine uniquely the propagator inside this region . if we complexify the original stckelberg function @xmath2 , and keeping the coordinates @xmath95 real , then eqns .",
    "( [ eq : munsang ] ) can be written in the modulus - argument form :    @xmath96    where @xmath97",
    ". then the problem of determining the propagator is reduced to solve the wave equation ( [ eq : waveequation ] ) , in the real functions @xmath98 and @xmath99 for fixed values of @xmath100 .",
    "this is analogous to the standard case illustrated by hawking and hartle @xcite .",
    "however , the main difference here is the fact that the function @xmath100 , contains the information of the extra - degrees of freedom of the theory .",
    "the propagator is analytic on the complexified horizon on the upper - half plane of the complex variable @xmath62 and on the lower half plane for the complex variable @xmath63 .",
    "the cauchy data is regular when :    @xmath101    where @xmath102 , with @xmath103 being the imaginary component of @xmath4 .",
    "if we know the exact dependence of the function @xmath4 , then we can separate easily the real part from the imaginary one .",
    "the extra - component of radiation , coming from the deformation of the periodicity pattern of the propagator produced by the stckelberg function @xmath2 , depends on whether or not there is an imaginary component for @xmath4 after doing the analytical extension on the variable @xmath0 .",
    "the observers defining the time in agreement with @xmath2 , will never be able to perceive any extra - component of radiation and they will define the same result of temperature as in gr . on the other hand , observers defining the time in an arbitrary direction with respect to @xmath2 , might be able to perceive an extra - component of radiation , depending on the explicit form of the stckelberg function .",
    "the propagator is analytic in @xmath2 in the same form as it appears in gr . the functions @xmath104 and @xmath105 satisfy the cauchy - riemann ( orthogonality ) conditions , already demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "then given the previous arguments , the propagator @xmath29 will be analytic in @xmath2 in a strip of width @xmath106 .",
    "notice however , that this means that :    @xmath107    if we want to solve for @xmath108 this previous inequality , we have to take into account that @xmath4 can be time - dependent .",
    "this means that this function can be written as :    @xmath109    where we have defined @xmath110 .",
    "the exact range of regularity for the propagator given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : regularity ] ) , and solved in terms of the standard complex time coordinate will depend on the exact form of the function @xmath4 .",
    "only if this function is time - independent , then it is possible to solve trivially for @xmath108 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : regularity ] ) as follows :    @xmath111    from these previous results , we can observe that the periodicity of the poles of the propagator might change due to the presence of the extra - degrees of freedom .",
    "in other words , the periodicity associated to the variable @xmath0 , is not necessarily the same periodicity associated to the function @xmath2 .",
    "the exact behavior of the poles of the propagator with respect to any observer , depends on the exact functional dependence of the stckelberg function @xmath2 .",
    "the modified period of the propagator , will reproduce a change on the amount of particles detected if the detectors operate by using the usual notion of time @xmath0 .",
    "the vainshtein radius marks the scale after which the extra - degrees of freedom become relevant , then it is expected that the effects explained in this manuscript are relevant after the vainshtein radius @xcite .",
    "if we use the stckelberg function as the time - coordinate , then the penrose diagram for the case with zero cosmological constant will not differ from the standard schwarzschild diagram shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig:1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "then the propagator @xmath29 with @xmath30 in the region @xmath94 of the diagram ( [ fig : momoko ] ) , still can be continued to @xmath112 .",

    "if the observers define the time in agreement with @xmath2 , then everything will look like gr .",
    "these special kind of observers will never perceive any difference between massive gravity and gr and they will describe the physics in agreement with the standard penrose diagram .",
    "the analytical extension just mentioned , marks the relation between the rates of emission and absorption of the black - hole .",
    "if we want to understand the physical effects of the extra - degrees of freedom , then we have to express the propagator in terms of the ordinary time @xmath0 . then for detectors operating with respect to @xmath0 , instead of @xmath2 ,",
    "the analytic extension does not necessarily relates the rate of emission with the rate of absorption of the black - hole radiation .",
    "this is because the extension is related not only to the complex part of the ordinary time variable @xmath0 , but also to the complex part of the function @xmath4 , namely @xmath103 .",

    "it is not clear at all what is the periodicity associated to the complex time .",
    "later i will demonstrate that for the case under study in this manuscript , the periodicity structure of the propagator , depends on the values of the free - parameters of the theory .",
