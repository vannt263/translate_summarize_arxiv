    "the angular integral gives two bessel functions of the first kind : @xmath156 after linearization , use of a suitable representation for the bessel functions brings the remaining integrals into a form that can readily be solved through residue integration , leading to @xmath157 + \\frac{k_f}{\\sqrt{\\beta } } \\operatorname{im}\\left(\\phi_1\\right ) \\big ) \\tau_x \\bigg]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have set @xmath158 to zero due to the one - dimensional structure of the system , as in the main text .",
    "we have here defined the function @xmath159 , where @xmath31 , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the modified bessel and struve functions of the first kind , respectively .    after inserting the obtained expressions into the bdg equation , we collect terms with the same prefactors and",

    "we can thus bring the nonlinear eigenvalue equation into the form .",
    "in this appendix , we derive an equation for the eigenvalues of eq .  .",
    "we start out with @xmath164 , where @xmath165 as noted in the main text , the energy dependence in the fourier transformed matrix elements has a negligible impact on the solution of the nonlinear eigenvalue problem .",
    "hence we can set the energy in them to zero , which in the main text is denoted by @xmath166 , but here we will forego that notation with no risk of confusion . by calculating the determinant , we observe that all remaining energy - dependence outside of @xmath46 is a single term proportional to @xmath167 .",
    "since we can write this in terms of @xmath168 , finding the zeros for the determinant reduces to solving a quadratic equation in @xmath169 @xmath170 where the coefficients @xmath57 are given by the expressions @xmath171 the quadratic equation has two solutions , but it turns out that for all relevant parameters , one of the solutions is negative , which is not sensible for @xmath169 .",
