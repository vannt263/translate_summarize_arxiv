    "though this is , in general , impossible , the wrinkling embedding theorem from @xcite allows us to do that after a certain additional modification of @xmath25 , called _ pleating _ , see theorem [ thm : folds ] .",
    "we then show that the pleating construction can be extended to the class of framed well balanced flifs , see section [ sec : pleat - flif ] .",
    "thus we get a framed well balanced flif @xmath154 extending the local framed leafwise igusa function @xmath16 .",
    "the proof now is concluded in two steps .",

    "the paper has the following organization . in section [ sec : distr - fold ]",
    "we discuss the notion of fold tangency of a submanifold with respect to a not necessarily integrable distribution , define the pleating construction for submanifolds and formulate the main technical result , theorem [ thm : folds ] , which is an analog for folded maps of gromov s directed embedding theorem , see @xcite .",
