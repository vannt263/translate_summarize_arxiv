    "observations with the _ rossi x  ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) satellite have revealed the presence of several quasi ",
    "periodic phenomena in the fourier power spectra of low  mass x  ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "they occur on timescales similar to the dynamical timescale near a neutron star , i.e. at frequencies around 1000 hz .",
    "kilohertz quasi  periodic oscillations ( khz qpos ) have been discovered in more than 20 sources ( van der klis et al .",
    "1996a , b ; strohmayer , zhang , & swank 1996 ; strohmayer et al .",
    "1996 ; see for the most recent review van der klis 2000 ) .",
    "in several lmxbs nearly coherent oscillations were discovered during type i x - ray bursts ( strohmayer et al . 1996 ; for a review see swank 2000 ) ; these burst oscillations presumably occur at frequencies close to the neutron star spin frequency ( strohmayer et al .",
    "recently , another high frequency quasi - periodic phenomenon was discovered in the power spectra of three lmxbs ( jonker , mndez , & van der klis 2000 ) .",
    "the khz qpos are nearly always found in pairs , although in a few sources so far only one khz qpo has been found ( zhang et al .",
    "1998 ; marshall & markwardt 1999 ; homan & van der klis 2000 ) .",
    "their frequencies vary over several hundred hz on timescales of hours to days ; in the best studied sources , it is found that the frequency separation of the twin khz qpos , @xmath2 , decreases monotonically by 50100 hz over the observed frequency range as the frequency of the khz qpo increases ( see e.g. van der klis et al .",
    "1997 ; mndez et al .",
    "1998 ; mndez , van der klis , & van paradijs 1998 ; mndez & van der klis 1999 ) ; observations of the khz qpo frequencies in the other sources are consistent with this trend ( jonker et al .",
    "1998 , psaltis et al . 1998 ) .",
    "various models exist for these qpos . immediately after their discovery a beat frequency model was proposed ( strohmayer et al . 1996 ) , of which the sonic  point model is the most current ( miller , lamb , & psaltis 1998 ; revised by lamb & miller 2000 ) .",
    "later , stella & vietri ( 1999 ) proposed the relativistic precession model ( but see markovi & lamb 2000 ) and osherovich & titarchuk ( 1999 ) introduced the two  oscillator model . in the latter model",
    "the qpo at @xmath3 ( the lower khz qpo ) occurs at the keplerian frequency of material orbiting the neutron star , whereas in the other two models the qpo at @xmath4 ( the upper khz qpo ) is the one that is keplerian .",
    "recently , psaltis & norman ( 2000 ) proposed the transition layer model in which the twin khz qpo peaks arise due to disk oscillations at frequencies close to those predicted by the relativistic precession model .    in this letter , we report the discovery of a khz qpo and a type i x  ray burst in 2s  0918549 .",
    "the source turns out to be one of the least luminous khz qpo sources , however , the fractional rms amplitude of the qpo is quite high .",
    "we study the dependence of the fractional rms amplitudes of the upper khz qpo on source luminosity across the ensemble of lmxbs and show that they are strongly anticorrelated .",
    "we have used observations obtained with the proportional counter array ( pca ; jahoda et al .",
    "1996 ) onboard the _ rxte _ satellite ( bradt , rothschild , & swank 1993 ) . a log of the observations and the average source count rates at the time of the observation can be found in table  [ obs_log ] . in total @xmath175 ksec of data",
    "were used in our analysis .",
    "data were obtained in four different modes .",
    "the standard 1 and 2 modes , which are always operational , respectively provide data with a time resolution of 0.125 seconds in just one energy bin and 16 seconds in 129 energy bins covering the effective pca 2 to 60 kev range .",
    "additionally , data were obtained using the mode providing the highest time resolution ( @xmath5 ) , combined with the full energy resolution _",
    "rxte _ can provide ( 256 energy bins covering the 2 to 60 kev ; the goodxenon mode ) .",
    "this mode saturates on count rates higher than @xmath18000 counts per second .    in order to follow spectral variations we created color ",
    "color diagrams ( cds ) by plotting a soft color vs. a hard color .",
    "the soft color was defined as the ratio between the count rates in the 3.56.4 kev and 23.5 kev energy band ; the hard color was defined as that between the 9.716.0 kev and 6.49.7 kev energy band .",
    "the data were background subtracted but no dead  time corrections were applied ( the dead  time is less than @xmath12% ) .",
    "the colors of the 1997 observations were corrected for pca gain changes , using crab observations obtained in may 1997 , and may 2000 . assuming the crab is constant , observed color changes of the crab between the observations of may 1997 and",
    "may 2000 should reflect changes of the instrument s spectral response .",
    "the observed changes in crab were @xmath16% in the soft color and @xmath11% in the hard color .",
    "the colors were converted to those which would have been detected by the pca on may 2000 ( cf . di salvo et al . 2000 ) .",
    "residual color errors due to the differences between the spectra of crab and 2s  0918549 are less than the statistical errors .",
    "we calculated fast fourier transforms with a nyquist frequency of 4096 hz of data segments of 16 seconds ( 260 kev ) .",
    "the power density spectra were averaged and fitted with a function consisting of lorentzians ( to represent peaks arising in the power spectrum due to qpos ) , a constant to account for the power due to poisson counting statistics , and an exponentially cutoff power law to represent the noise component apparent at low frequencies .",
    "errors on the fit parameters were calculated using @xmath6 ( 1@xmath7 single parameter ) .",
    "the 95% confidence upper limits were determined using @xmath8 .",
    "the color  color diagram of 2s  0918549 ( see fig .  [ cd ] ; left ) resembles that of an atoll source .",
    "the squares represent the average of 256  s of data from observations 110 , the filled circles are 128  s averages from observation 11 , and the open circles are 128  s averages from observations 12 and 13 . together with the timing properties ( described below ) it is clear that the squares represent the island state and the open and filled circles the banana branch of an atoll source .",
    "the average power spectrum of observations 110 combined ( see fig .  [ cd ] , right , top ) shows a strong band limited noise component , which could be described using an exponentially cutoff power law with a fractional rms amplitude of 26%@xmath01% ( integrated over 0.1100 hz , 260 kev ) , a power law index of 0.47@xmath00.05 , and a cutoff frequeny of 21@xmath06 hz .",
    "we derived a 95% confidence upper limit on the presence of a khz qpo with a full - width at half maximum ( fwhm ) 100 hz in the range of 3001200 hz of @xmath130% ( rms ) .",
    "we discovered a khz qpo at 1156@xmath09 hz , with a fwhm of 68@xmath023 hz , and a fractional rms amplitude of 18%@xmath02% ( 260 kev ) in the average power spectrum of observation 11 ( see fig .",
    "[ khz ] ) .",
    "in addition , the average power spectrum of observation 11 ( fig .  [ cd ] , right , bottom ) shows a peaked noise component at a frequency of 25@xmath02 hz , with a fractional rms amplitude of 17%@xmath02% , and a fwhm of 22@xmath06 hz . to investigate the peak noise component and the khz qpo further , we also calculated power spectra using data in the 4.018.0 kev energy band .",
    "the values measured in the 4.018.0 kev energy band are the same within the errors , although the significance of the detection of the khz qpo is somewhat higher ( 6.1@xmath7 compared to 5.7 @xmath7 in the 260 kev band ) .",
    "we subdivided the 4.018.0 kev power spectra of observation 11 in two parts .",
    "the frequency of the khz qpo increased from 1126@xmath09 hz in the first part of observation 11 to 1218@xmath9 hz at the end .",
    "the source moved further up the banana branch , from an average hard and soft color of 0.452@xmath00.003 and 2.49@xmath00.01 to 0.431@xmath00.003 and 2.64@xmath00.01 , respectively .",
    "the background subtracted count rate in the 4.018.0 kev energy band , the fwhm , and the fractional rms amplitude are consistent with being the same in the two parts .",
    "the properties of the peaked noise component were consistent with being the same in the two selections .",
    "no power spectral components were detected in the average power spectrum of observations 12 and 13 combined .",
    "we derived an upper limit on the presence of a 100 hz wide khz qpo of @xmath113% rms in the range between 3001200 hz in both the 260 kev and the 4.018.0 kev energy band , and an upper limit of 5%6% on the presence of a power law component at frequencies in the range of 0.1 to 100 hz in both the 260 kev and the 4.018.0 kev energy band , with a power law index of 1.0 .    during observation 11",
    "a type i x  ray burst occurred ( see fig .  [ lc_burst ] ) .",
    "this is the first detection of a burst in 2s  0918549 , and establishes the compact object as a neutron star . as apparent in fig .",
    "[ lc_burst ] the burst profile was complex , with a smooth exponential decay with an e - folding time of 8.95@xmath00.05  s beginning @xmath10 seconds after the initial rise . due to the very high count rates of more than 20000 counts per second ( 3 detector count rate )",
    "the goodxenon mode saturated . the total count rate displayed in fig .",
    "[ lc_burst ] is for the 0.125 s standard 1 data which were not affected by this saturation . during",
    "the part of the decay where the count rate was less than 8000 counts per second spectral analysis shows cooling of the blackbody spectral component . using the 16  s standard 2 mode we derive a flux for the 16  s bin containing the burst peak of @xmath11 erg @xmath12 s@xmath13 ( 2 - 20 kev ) . since the mean count rate in this 16  s time bin is a factor of @xmath14 2.5 lower than the peak count rate as measured using the 1/8  s bin of the standard 1 observations , we use this factor to improve our estimation of the peak burst flux .",
    "we did not correct for the deadtime effects which become important at the count rates at the peak of the burst ( @xmath125% ) , this provides a lower limit on the peak flux .",
    "the pre  burst flux is less than @xmath15 erg @xmath12 s@xmath13 ( 2 - 20 kev ) .",
    "so , the persistent emission of the source when it is on the lower banana branch is less than 0.5 percent of the eddington luminosity . assuming the peak burst flux to be isotropic and at or below the eddington limit of @xmath16 erg s@xmath13 we derive an upper limit to the distance of 4.9 kpc .",
    "[ lc_burst ]",
    "we discovered a khz qpo at a frequency of @xmath11156 hz with a fractional rms amplitude of nearly 20% ( 260 kev ) in the x  ray emission of the lmxb 2s  0918549 .",
    "for the first time in this source a type i x  ray burst was detected , establishing the nature of the compact object in 2s  0918549 as a neutron star .",
    "we derived an upper limit to the persistent luminosity when the source is on the lower banana branch of 0.005 @xmath17 making 2s  0918549 one of the least luminous lmxbs in which a khz qpo has been observed .",
    "the spectral and timing properties indicate that this source is a low  luminous atoll source , displaying the full complement of spectral and timing states ( island state and a full banana branch ) .",
    "similar to other khz qpo sources , e.g. mndez et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the khz qpo was only observed when the source was on the lower part of the banana branch .",
    "its frequency changed from @xmath188 hz to 1218@xmath020 hz , when the source moved further on the banana branch , similar to other atoll sources ( e.g. mndez et al .",
    "its frequency is similar to the frequency of the _ upper _ khz qpo in other atoll sources in a similar lower  banana state ( e.g. di salvo et al . 2000 , mndez et al .",
    "the frequency of the lower khz qpo is usually lower in that part of the cd .",
    "furthermore , when both qpos of the twin khz qpos are detected simultaneously the frequency of the lower khz qpo has never been found at frequencies larger than @xmath1900 hz in any lmxb ( see van der klis 2000 ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that this khz qpo is most likely the upper peak of the khz qpo pair which is detected in most other lmxbs .",
    "after 4u  0614 + 109 , 2s  0918549 is another example of a very low luminous lmxb whose khz qpos are strong , whereas in the most luminous lmbxs , the z  sources , the khz qpos tend to be weak ( see also the review of van der klis 2000 ) . to further investigate this ,",
    "we compared the fractional rms amplitudes of the khz qpo in 2s  0918549 with those of the upper khz qpo in other lmxbs . in order to account for the fact that in a given source the fractional rms amplitude of the khz qpo changes as its frequency changes we measured the fractional rms amplitude at both the lowest and highest frequency at which the upper khz qpo is found . from extensive studies for several sources",
    "it is clear that the fractional rms amplitude of the upper khz qpo decreases monotonically as the frequency of the upper peak increases ( e.g. wijnands et al .",
    "1997 , jonker et al .",
    "1998 , wijnands et al .",
    "1998 , mndez , van der klis , & ford 2000 ) .",
    "this ensures that the method we used will yield a good indication of the range in fractional rms amplitude spanned in each source .",
    "the sample we studied here contains only those sources for which a significant detection of the upper khz qpo in the 560 kev energy range was possible ( 4u  0614 + 09 ; ford et al .",

    "sco  x1 was not included since the fractional rms amplitude of the qpos can not be calculated accurately at present due to the severe dead - time effects present in this source .",
    "we calculated the 560 kev fractional rms amplitude in order to avoid as much as possible systematic effects on the derived fractional rms amplitudes of the peaks due to the different @xmath19 values towards the various sources .    the range in fractional rms amplitude of the upper khz qpo in each source is plotted in fig .",

    "it is apparent that the upper khz qpos detected in low ",

    "van paradijs & van der klis ( 1994 ) found that the hardness , defined as the ratio of counts between the 4080 kev band and the 1325 kev band , is in neutron star lmxbs correlated with the x  ray luminosity .",
    "this suggests that the x  ray flux variability of the source at the khz qpo frequency is correlated with the hardness in that band ( see also ford et al .",
    "1997 ) . within a source",
    "a similar correlation between the fractional rms amplitude of the upper khz qpo and the hardness of the energy spectrum has been found ; the harder the source the higher the fractional rms amplitude of the upper khz qpo ( e.g. 4u  0614 + 091 , ford et al .",

    "a two  component accretion flow ( radially and through a disk , gosh and lamb 1979 ) has been considered to explain that the frequency of the khz qpo does not depend on source luminosity ( ford et al .",
    "the observed anticorrelation between the fractional rms amplitude of the upper khz qpo and the source luminosity can not solely be explained by an increase of an unmodulated part of the accretion flow towards higher source luminosity , since the increase in luminosity is too large compared with the decrease in fractional rms amplitude .",
    "therefore , this can not explain the findings of ford et al .",
    "the same conclusion was drawn by mndez et al .",
