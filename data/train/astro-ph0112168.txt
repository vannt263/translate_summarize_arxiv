    "this volume in honor of jan van paradijs can be regarded as a state of the art reference on , basically , all relevant aspects and observations for grbs . basically , references should be given to almost all presentations . for practical reasons ,",
    "we want to refer globally to those at this point .",
    "the evidence for connection between supernovae ( sn ) and gamma - ray bursters ( grb ) include the coincidence between sn1998bw and grb  980425 , bumps in the afterglow of some grbs which are compatible with an underlying sn explosion , possible identification of the fe k line in the x - rays , and some evidence that grbs are related to star forming region .",
    "it becomes increasingly obvious that both the mechanism causing grbs and sne are intrinsically highly aspherical .",
    "these evidences provide the basis for the current suggestions that the sn and grb are connected .",
    "in particular , the direct collapse of the central region a very massive star to a black hole and the connection with the newly found hypernovae is a very attractive option ( e.g. woosley & macfayden 1999 , fryer et al .",
    "1999 ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the core of a massive star collapses directly to a black hole .",
    "subsequently , an accretion disk is formed and a ultra - relativistic jet is launched .",
    "about 0.5 @xmath0 of radioactive ni is ejected . despite the evidence ,",
    "there are are number of unsolved problems .",
    "grb  980425 was about a factor of 1000 dimmer than typical grbs .",
    "the properties of the optical afterglow of grbs strongly suggest a very low density environment unlike those to be expected in star forming regions . a low barion load is required despite the jet - launch in a high density star , and there seems to be no coincidence between snii , sneib / c and grbs . from theory and",
    "based on 2-d models , the formation of highly relativistic jets has been demonstrated to occur ( aloy et al .",
    "2000 ) but the energies of the ultra - relativistic parts of the jet are smaller by many orders of magnitude ( @xmath1 ) compared to the emitted @xmath2-ray energy , and the question on the stability of the narrow jets has been posed . moreover ,",
    "if @xmath3 is ejected , we would expect rather two k - shell lines due to @xmath3 and @xmath4 rather than one feature as reported .",
    "we note that neither of the problems must be regarded as a killer for the hyper - supernovae / grb connection but they have to be solved .",
    "+ depending on taste , we may feel close to the solution of the grb problem , or far away .",
    "one of the reasons is the lack of understanding of the normal core collapse sne or , more precisely , the mechanism which results into the ejection of the envelope . here , we want to ask for the current status of core collapse sne and their relation to grbs . at the end",
    ", we want to discuss the merging between a neutron star and wd as an additional scenario which , at the same time , may account for some of the subluminous thermonuclear explosions ( sneia ) and some of the grbs .",
    "core collapse supernovae are the final stages of stellar evolution in massive stars during which the central region collapses , forms a neutron star ( ns ) or a black hole , and the outer layers are ejected .",
    "recent explosion scenarios assumed that the ejection is due to energy deposition by neutrinos into the envelope but detailed models do not produce powerful explosions and , in most cases , do not trigger the ejection of the envelope at all ( e.g. yamada et al .",
    "1999 , ramp & janka 2000 , mezzacappa et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "there is new and mounting evidence for an asphericity and , in particular , for axial symmetry in several sne which may be hard to reconcile within the spherical picture .",
    "this evidence includes the observed high polarization and its variation with time ( e.g. wang et al . 2001 , leonard et al . 2000 ) , pulsar kicks ( strom et al .",
    "1995 ) , high velocity iron - group and intermediate - mass element material observed in remnants ( lucy 1987 , tueller et al . 1991 ) , direct observations of the debris of sn1987a ( wang et al .",
    "2001 , hflich , khokhlov & wang 2001 ) , etc . to be in agreement with the observations ,",
    "any successful mechanism must invoke some sort of axial symmetry for the explosion . as a limiting case",
    ", we consider jet - induced / dominated explosions of `` classical '' core collapse sne .",
    "the discovery of magnetars ( kouveliotou et al .",
    "1998 , duncan & thomson 1992 ) revived the idea that a mhd - jet with appropriate properties may be formed at the ns or bh ( leblanc & wilson 1970 , symbalisty 1984 ) .",
    "our study is based on detailed 3-d hydrodynamical and radiation transport models ( khokhlov 1998 , hflich et al .",
    "1998 , 2001 ) .",
    "we demonstrate the influence of the jet properties and of progenitor structure on the final density , chemical structure and the fallback of material .      *",
    "the setup : * the computational domain is a cube of size @xmath5 with a spherical star of radius @xmath6 and mass @xmath7 placed in the center .",
    "the innermost part with mass @xmath8 and radius @xmath9  cm , consisting of fe and si , is assumed to have collapsed on a timescale much faster than the outer , lower - density material .",
    "it is removed and replaced by a point gravitational source with mass @xmath10 representing the newly formed neutron star .",
    "the remaining mass of the envelope @xmath11 is mapped onto the computational domain . at two polar locations where the jets are initiated at @xmath12",
    ", we impose an inflow with velocity @xmath13 and a density @xmath14 . at @xmath15 ,",
    "the jet density and pressure are the same as those of the background material .",
    "for the first 0.5  s , the jet velocity at @xmath15 is kept constant at @xmath13 .",
    "after 0.5  s , the velocity of the jets at @xmath15 was gradually decreased to zero at approximately 2  s. the total energy of the jets is @xmath16 .",
    "these parameters are consistent with , but somewhat less than , those of the leblanc - wilson model .    * the reference model : * as a baseline case",
    ", we consider a jet - induced explosion in a helium star .",
    "jet propagation inside the star is shown in fig .",
    "as the jets move outwards , they remain collimated and do not develop much internal structure . a bow shock forms at the head of the jet and spreads in all directions , roughly cylindrically around each jet .",
    "the jet - engine has been switched off after about 2.5 seconds , the material of the bow shock continues to propagate through the star .",
    "the stellar material is shocked by the bow shock .",
    "mach shocks travels towards the equator resulting in a redistribution of the energy .",
    "the opening angle of the jet depends on the ratio between the velocity of the bow shock to the speed of sound . for a given star ,",
    "this angle determines the efficiency of the deposition of the jet energy into the stellar envelope . here , the efficiency of the energy deposition is about 40 % , and the final asymmetry of the envelope is about two .",
    "* influence of the jet properties : * fig .",
    "[ jet2 ] shows two examples of an explosion with a low and a very high jet velocity compared to the baseline case ( fig .",
    "[ jet1 ] ) . fig .",
    "[ jet2 ] demonstrates the influence of the jet velocity on the opening angle of the jet and , consequently , on the efficiency of the energy deposition .",
    "for the low velocity jet , the jet engine is switched off long before the jet penetrates the stellar envelope .",
    "almost all of the energy of the jet goes into the stellar explosion . on a contrary , the fast jet ( 61,000 km / sec ) triggers only a weak explosion of 0.9 foe although its total energy was @xmath17 .",
    "* influence of the progenitor : * for a very extended star , as in case of normal type ii supernovae , the bow shock of a low velocity jet stalls within the envelope , and the entire jet energy is used to trigger the ejection of the stellar envelope . in our example ( fig . [ model ] ) , the jet material penetrates the helium core at about 100 seconds .",
    "after about 250 seconds the material of the jet stalls within the hydrogen rich envelope and after passing about 5 solar masses in the radial mass scale of the spherical progenitor . at this time ,",
    "the isobars are almost spherical , and an almost spherical shock front travels outwards .",
    "consequently , strong asphericities are limited to the inner regions .",
    "after about 385 seconds , we stopped the 3-d run and remaped the outer layers into 1-d structure , and followed the further evolution in 1-d .",
    "after about 1.8 @xmath18 seconds , the shock front reaches the surface .",
    "after about 3 days , the envelope expands homologously .",
    "the region where the jet material stalled , expands at velocities of about 4500 km / sec .",
    "* fallback : * jet - induced sn have very different characteristics with respect to fallback of material and the innermost structure . in 1-d calculations and for stars with main sequence masses",
    "of less than 20 @xmath19 and explosion energies in excess of 1 foe , the fallback of material remains less than 1.e-2 to 1.e-3 @xmath19 and an inner , low density cavity is formed with an outer edge of @xmath3 . for explosion energies between 1 and 2 foe , the outer edge of the cavity expands typically with velocities of about 700 to 1500 km / sec ( e.g. woosley 1997 , hflich et al .",
    "in contrast , we find strong , continuous fallback of @xmath20 in our 3-d models , and no lower limit for the velocity of the expanding material ( fig . 4 of khokhlov & hflich 2001 ) .",
    "this significant amount of fallback must have important consequences for the secondary formation of a black hole .",
    "the exact amount and time scales for the final accretion on the ns will depend sensitively on the rotation and momentum transport .",
    "* chemical structure : * the final chemical profiles of elements formed during the stellar evolution such as he , c , o and si are butterfly - shaped whereas the jet material fills an inner , conic structure ( fig .",
    "[ model ] , upper , middle panel ) .",
    "the composition of the jets must reflect the composition of the innermost parts of the star , and should contain heavy and intermediate - mass elements , freshly synthesized material such as @xmath3 and , maybe , r - process elements because , in our examples , the entropy at the bow shock region of the jet was as high as a few hundred , a crucial condition for a successful r - process in a high-@xmath21 environment . in any case , during the explosion , the jets bring heavy and intermediate mass elements into the outer h - rich layers .",
    "* radiation transport effects : * for the compact progenitors of sne  ib / c , the final departures of the iso - density contours from sphericity are typically a factor of two .",
    "this will produce a linear polarization of about 2 to 3 % ( hflich et al .",
    "1995 ) consistent with the values observed for sne  ib / c . in case of a red supergiant , i.e. sne  ii",
    ", the asphericity is restricted to the inner layers of the h - rich envelope . there",
    "the iso - densities show an axis ratio of up to @xmath22 1.3 .",
    "the intermediate and outer h - rich layers remain spherical .",
    "thus , even within the picture of jet - induced explosion , the latter effect alone can not ( ! ) account for the high polarization produced in the intermediate h - rich layers of core - collapse sn with a massive envelope such as sn  1999em where asymmetric ionization by @xmath2 photons for an aspherical chemical distribution of @xmath3 is crucial ( see fig . [ model ] and hflich et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "* conclusions : * our calculations show that low velocity , massive jets can explain the observations of core collapse sne .",
    "these kind of jets , however , will not produce typical grb energies though @xmath23-rays with total energies of @xmath24 may be produced at the jet - breakout in case of the explosion of a snic ( khokhlov et al .",
    "1998 ) and , within this picture , events such as sn1998bw / grb  980425 may be understood .",
    "however , the typical properties of the jets make supernovae with neutron star remnants very unlikely candidates to produce grbs within the same scenario .",
    "all potential candidates for a grb / sn connection seem to require the prompt ( macfayden et al .",
    "2001 ) or delayed formation of a black hole . whether this is sufficient , remains to be seen .",
    "in this section , we want to propose an alternative scenario for sn - grb - connection : the merger of a co white dwarf ( wd ) and a ns .",
    "these systems are expected to be formed at a relatively high rate , @xmath25 per year and galaxy and a large fraction of them will merge within a hubble time via the emission of gravitational waves , therefore making an important contribution to the population of potential grb progenitor systems ( davies et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "in some of these systems , e.g. j1141 - 6546 , the wd seems to have formed _ before _ the ns and therefore the time scale to form these systems is set by the neutron star formation time scale .",
    "once formed , 5% ( 20% , 50% ) of the binaries will merge within 10@xmath26 ( 10@xmath27 , 10@xmath28 ) years , reconciling this scenario with the observation that ( at least some ) grbs seem to occur in star forming regions .",
    "+ the basic phenomenology of the scenario is as follows : the wd transfers mass to the ns , which subsequently settles into an accretion disk around the ns .",
    "once enough material is accreted , the ns may collapse to a black hole ( bh ) . as we will see below",
    ", this event may show properties similar to thermonuclear sne , i.e. sne  ia and , at the same time , may contribute to the phenomenon called grbs .",
    "though , this event can not be the main contributor to either sne  ia or grbs because of the rate and properties of typical sne  ia or of grbs ( piran , this volume ) .",
    "* simulation : * in the following example , the results are based on a calculation using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics code , in which self - gravity is calculated using a binary - tree , the equation of state accounts for the nuclei , electron - positron pairs and photons . for further details",
    "we refer to rosswog et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2000 , 1999 ) .",
    "we have followed the final stages of the merging process between a neutron star and a c / o white dwarf of 0.7 @xmath19 and a radius of 7000 km .",
    "the neutron star is modelled as a point mass of 1.4 @xmath19 , the wd is resolved with @xmath29 particles . to model all the details of the mass transfer from the wd to the ns from the onset until the final wd - disruption is an almost impossible task :",
    "the initial mass transfer happens with rates too tiny to be resolved accurately in a full 3d calculation and , even worse , happens on time scales much too long to be followed by an explicit code whose time step is set by the sound velocity within the wd .",
    "therefore the initial separation has to be chosen as a compromise between accuracy and feasibility , we chose 22,000 km in order to see the onset of particles being transferred to the ns within the first orbit .",
    "therefore we neglect the existence of a low - mass disk which may exist before the tidal disruption sets in , but for the current , exploratory purposes this treatment is sufficent .",
    "the evolution of the system can be seen in fig .",
    "[ merger ] .",
    "within one orbital revolution mass transfer towards the ns sets in and leads to the formation of an accretion disk .",
    "this disk is fed continuoulsy from the wd for roughly four orbital periods before , at about 150 s , tidal disruption sets in .",
    "+ * sn : * the corresponding temperature and density distributions are shown as a function of the distance to the neutron star at 150 s. at this time , typical densities and temperatures at the central region of the disk ( @xmath30 km ) are 1 to 3 @xmath31 g/@xmath32 and in excess of 1.3@xmath33 k , respectively .",
    "these conditions are remarkable similar to those found in sneia . under these conditions ,",
    "the nuclear burning time scales are of the order of 0.1 to 1 sec , i.e. comparable or shorter than the hydrodynamic time scales .",
    "a nuclear detonation front will form and burn parts of the envelope . assuming a time scale of 1 sec , all material with @xmath34 larger than 6 , 5.6 and 5 g/@xmath35 will undergo complete si , explosive o and c burning , respectively .",
    "the corresponding products are mainly @xmath3 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively . in our example",
    ", only @xmath38 of @xmath39 can be expected to be produced , and about 0.4 to 0.5 @xmath0 are ejected during the thermonuclear explosion .",
    "detailed calculations for the further hydrodynamical evolution and light curves are underway using our radiation hydro code including a detailed nuclear network .",
    "this scenario will not be able to account for a typical sne  ia but it may contribute to the subclass of very underluminous sne  ia , and it may be able to account for the bumps in some afterglows and the iron k line in the x - ray spectra observed in some grbs .",
    "+ * grb : * at the end of the simulation roughly 1.9 @xmath19 are contained in the ns+disk - system , around 0.2 @xmath19 form the tidal tail that moves outwards .",
    "if we assume that , eventually , the sn - explosion forms a black - hole and that @xmath40 of material in the tidal tail survives the explosion while orbiting around the bh , we are left with the standard grb - model , bh + debris , and an energy reservoir of a few times 10@xmath41 erg , enough for the estimated , typical grb - energy of @xmath42 erg ( frail et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the grb may occur when the surviving debris falls back towards the bh , the delay between the sn - explosion and the grb can be expected to be of the order @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the semi - major axis of the debris orbit , but this delay is very sensitive to the details of the individual merger process . + the current study should be seen as pilot project to investigate the potential of this scenario .",
    "many aspects have not yet been explored in full .",
    "for example , we did not investigate the details of the wd - spins , the ignition process as a function of time , the details of the accretion on the neutron star and so on .",
    "these topics are subject to future investigations .",
