    "at the supernova ( sn ) explosion , various heavy elements / isotopes are produced as a strong shock wave passes through the inner region of the progenitor star . among these newly synthesized products , important is radioactive @xmath0ni ( clayton et al .",
    "the decay chain @xmath0ni @xmath1 @xmath0co @xmath1 @xmath0fe produces @xmath2-ray lines with average energy per decay @xmath3 mev ( @xmath0ni decay with an e - folding time of 8.8 days ) or @xmath4 mev ( @xmath0co decay with an e - folding time 113.7 days ) .",
    "these line @xmath2-rays are degraded along their paths through the sn ejecta by pair production , compton scattering , and photoelectric absorption ( e.g. , cass & lehoucq 1994 for a review ) .",
    "the absorbed energy is the source of the optical output of a sn in the case of type ib / c sne ( sne ib / c ) ( e.g. , maeda et al .",
    "2003 for a review ) .    by looking at properties of these @xmath2- and x - rays",
    ", it is expected that we can directly extract information on the distribution and the amount of @xmath0ni , which are closely related to the explosion mechanism .",
    "such observations have been performed only for very nearby sn 1987a ( dotani et al .",
    "1987 ; sunyaev et al . 1987 ; matz et al .",
    "attempts to detect the high emission from distant sne ( e.g. , at @xmath5 mpc ) have not been successful because of limited observational instruments in the past ( matz & share 1990 ; lichti et al .",
    "1994 ; morris et al . 1997 ; leising et al .",
    "however , now that _ integral _ and _ suzaku _ have been operated , and some new observatories are being planned ( e.g. , takahashi et al . 2001 ) , it is time to revisit theoretical prediction ( e.g. , mccray et al . 1987 ; woosley et al . 1987 ; shibazaki & ebisuzaki 1988 ; kumagai et al .",
    "1989 ) taking into account recent developments in sn research , i.e. , multidimensionality ( see e.g. , maeda & nomoto 2003 , maeda et al . 2006ab , and references therein ) .",
    "recently , multidimensional models for a supernova explosion become more and more popular . especially ,",
    "bipolar explosion models have been intensively studied in their explosion characteristics and nucleosynthetic features ( e.g. , nagataki 2000 ; maeda et al .",
    "2002 ; maeda & nomoto 2003 ) .",
    "there have been some observational evidence of such bipolar explosions ",

    "2002 ; wang et al . 2003",
    "; leonard et al . 2006 ) .    to judge a validity of a model , we have to compare model predictions with observations in details . for this purpose",
    ", we have been developing supernova multidimensional radiation transfer code _ samurai _",
    "( maeda et al . 2006ab ; maeda 2006 ; tanaka et al",
    "the code has been applied to very energetic supernova ( hypernova ) sn ic 1998bw associated with a gamma - ray burst . by comparing the model predictions with optical spectra and light curve of sn 1998bw in details , maeda et al .",
    "( 2006ab ) concluded that sn 1998bw is the bipolar explosion viewed from the jet direction .    in this paper , we present the model prediction for radioactive decay @xmath2- and x - rays from supernovae driven by bipolar jets .",
    "details are presented in maeda ( 2006 ) ( see also hungerford et al . 2003 , 2005 ) .",
    "although the model has been applied to hypernovae , we believe that most of the model predictions apply even to usual sne ib / c which also show some evidence of asphericity ( e.g. , wang et al .",
    "we use a fully time- and energy - dependent radiation transfer scheme to follow the high energy photons resulting from @xmath0ni / co / fe decay chain .",
    "this is done by using a monte - carlo method .",
    "line @xmath2-rays are produced according to the decay probabilities , then the photons are followed along their paths in which they suffer from pair creation , compton scattering , and photoelectric absorption in expanding 3d sn ejecta .",
    "the detail is described in maeda ( 2006 ) .",
    "we adopt the bipolar model a from maeda et al .",
    "( 2006b ) , which successfully reproduces the optical observations of hypernova sn 1998bw .",
    "the hydrodynamic and nucleosynthetic features have been examined in detail in maeda et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . for comparison",
    ", we also examine the spherical model s. the ejecta structure ( density and @xmath0ni ) is shown in figure 1 . in model",
    "a , @xmath0ni is distributed preferentially along the jet axis because the materials in this direction experience high temperature ( i.e. , @xmath6 k ) at the explosion . on the other hand ,",
    "the density is enhanced in the equatorial plane ( showing a disk - like structure ) , since only a weak shock wave pushes materials outward in the equatorial direction ( maeda et al .",
    "2002 ; maeda & nomoto 2003 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the high energy spectra at @xmath7 and @xmath8 days , which are obtained by our simulations .",
    "hereafter , @xmath9 is the time after the explosion .",
    "the aspherical model a has three unique features as compared to the spherical model s.    * * large line - to - continuum ratio : * model a shows a large line - to - continuum ratio , especially early on . in model",
    "a , the source of the high energy emission , i.e. , @xmath0ni / co , is abundantly present around the jet axis ( @xmath10-direction ) . in this direction ,",
    "the density is small , thus the optical depth is small , as the consequence of the jet - induced explosion .",
    "thus , few photons suffer from multiple compton scatterings which create the continuum in model a. since the situation does not change very much as time goes by , the line - to - continuum ratio does not show noticeable temporal evolution .",
    "+ also , the line - to - continuum ratio is not sensitive to the viewing orientation .",
    "both observers in the @xmath10- and @xmath11-direction look at the same region , i.e. , the @xmath0ni / co - rich jet .",
    "the line - to - continuum ratio is determined by local physical conditions in the emitting region , which is same irrespective of the observer s direction .",
    "thus , it is nearly independent from the observer s direction .",
    "an exception is a line profile , which is discussed in  3.2 .",
    "+ in model s , a situation is different .",
    "the @xmath0ni / co - rich region is surrounded by massive envelopes in model s. the line photons experience many scatterings , creating the high level of the continuum . in model",
    "s , the envelope becomes less and less optical thick due to the sn expansion , thus the continuum level becomes lower and lower as time goes by .",
    "* * large cut - off energy : * the hard x - ray cut - off , which is created by photoelectric absorption , is at higher energy in model a than model s. in model a , the last scattering point is close to the @xmath0ni - enhanced jet , thus the photoelectric absorption takes place in the fe - rich materials .",
    "since the situation does not change as time goes by , the cut - off energy does not show temporal evolution .",
    "this behavior is again insensitive to the observer s direction .",
    "+ on the other hand , model s shows temporal evolution .",
    "early on , the last scattering takes place near the surface where o is the dominant element .",
    "later on , the last scattering point moves deeper to the inner region where fe is the dominant element .",
    "thus , the cut - off energy moves from lower to higher energy . * * early emergence : * in model a , escape of the high energy photons occurs earlier than in model s if the kinetic energy of the expanding sn ejecta is the same .",
    "this is expected since @xmath0ni is produced along the axis where the optical depth is low in model a.      line profiles are also different for models a and s. as an example , figure 3 shows the line profiles of @xmath0co 1,238 kev line .",
    "other lines have similar properties , but the line blending should be taken into account ( e.g. , @xmath0ni 812 kev and @xmath0co 847 kev ) .",
    "model a yields a blueshifted line if viewed from the jet ( @xmath10- ) direction . in this case",
    ", an observer views the optically thin @xmath0ni / co - rich region from the jet ( @xmath10- ) direction , and the emission from the other hemisphere is blocked by the optically thick central region .",
    "the central region continues to be optically thick at @xmath12 days , thus the line keeps to be blueshifted .",
    "if model a is viewed from the @xmath11-direction , then two @xmath0ni / co - rich jets in both hemispheres can be seen . in this case , the emitting regions ( the jets ) are moving to the directions perpendicular to the observer .",
    "thus , the line is centered at the rest wavelength when viewed from the @xmath11-direction .",
    "the situation does not change as time goes by , thus the line center does not evolve as a function of time in model a ( irrespective of the observer s direction ) .",
    "however , the situation is different for model s. early on , only the outer region of the @xmath0ni / co - rich region is seen , yielding the blueshifted line .",
    "as time goes by , the observer can look into the deeper region ( because of the ejecta expansion and the density decrease ) , thus the line center continuously moves from the blue to the rest wavelength .",
    "cccc[t ] line - to - cont & small & large & large + cut - off e & low & high & high + evolution of spectra & large & small & small + line profile & evolved & blue & rest + evolution of lines & blue to rest & small & small    we have shown in this paper that expected observed features in the high energy emission are highly dependent on the geometry of the explosion . models a and s have quite different characteristics , thus these model can be distinguished by observations of the high energy emission . among the features ,",
    "the line profile is very sensitive to the viewing orientation in model a. thus , if we can perform deep observations to detect the line profile , then even the viewing orientation can be distinguished .",
    "in addition , temporal evolution is very different for models a and s. the expected features are summarized in table 1 .    for the sensitivity of _ integral _ ( @xmath13 in @xmath14 sec ) , we estimate that the maximum distances within which the @xmath2-rays are detectable are @xmath15 kpc , @xmath16 mpc , and @xmath17 mpc for sne ii , canonical sne ib / c , and hypernovae , respectively . since sn ii 1987a , the nearest sne for each type are sn ii 2004dj ( @xmath18 mps ) , sn ic 1994i ( @xmath19 mpc ) , and the hypernova sn ic 2002ap ( @xmath5 mpc ) .",
    "thus , the sensitivity of _ integral _ is unfortunately not enough to detect these core - collapse sne in the pace of 1 per 2 decades , unless very nearby sne like sn 1987a fortunately appears in the sky .",
    "if new generation hard x- and @xmath2-ray telescopes are designed to achieve a sensitivity @xmath20 magnitude or two better than the current instrument ( takahashi et al .",
    "2001 ) , then it is expected that the high energy emission from core - collapse sne can be detected @xmath20 sn per year .",
    "this sensitivity will lead to a comprehensive study of the sn explosive physics through observing the high energy emission ."
