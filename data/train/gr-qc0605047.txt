    "recently there have been advances in our abilities in cosmological observations for the quest of exploring the expansion history of the universe .",
    "it carries cosmology well beyond determining the present dimensionless density of matter @xmath1 and deceleration parameter @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it seems possible to reconstruct the entire function @xmath3 representing the expansion history of the entire universe .",
    "earlier on , cosmologists sought only a local measurement of the first two derivatives of the scale factor a , evaluated at a single time @xmath4 .",
    "attempt will be made trying instead to map out the function determining the global dynamics of the universe in the near future .",
    "one notes that many qualitative elements of cosmology follow directly from the structure of the metric@xcite .",
    "therefore , deeper understanding of our universe requires knowledge of the dynamics of the scale factor @xmath3 echoing the transition of energy between components from the epoch of radiation domination to that of matter domination .",
    "this is also known to be a key element in the growth of density perturbations into large structure .",
    "indeed , many proposed observation will be able to probe the function a(t ) more completely throughout all ages of the universe @xcite .",
    "a number of promising methods are being developed including the magnitude - redshift relation of type ia supernovae .",
    "the goal of mapping out the recent expansion history of the universe is well motivated .",
    "the thermal history of the universe , extending back through structure formation , matter - radiation decoupling , radiation thermalization , primordial nucleosynthesis , etc .",
    "is very important in the study of cosmology and particle physics , high energy physics , neutrino physics , gravitational physics , nuclear physics , and so on @xcite .",
    "expansion history of the universe is similarly a very promising research focus with the discovery of the current acceleration of the expansion of the universe .",
    "this includes the study of the role of high energy field theories in the form of possible quintessence , scalar - tensor gravitation , higher dimension theories , brane worlds , etc in the very recent universe .",
    "the accelerated expansion is also important to the possible fate of the universe @xcite .",
    "it is hence important to obtain the magnitude - redshift law relating to the scale factor - time behavior @xmath3 from these supernova observations with the proposed supernova / acceleration probe mission @xcite .",
    "therefore , the study of modelling different equation of state ( eos ) derived from different theories plays an important role in the study of the recent expansion history of our universe .",
    "the study of dark matter and possible contribution from different combinations of different theories including the sugra and string theory will become important also in the near future once the lhc experiment starts . therefore all practical methods to study its impact on the evolution history of our universe deserve full attentions . in fact , there have been proposals to parameterize different candidate models that are helpful in extracting important physics with the help of several different linear parameterizations of parameter @xmath5 or @xmath6 for the corresponding equation of state function @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "these linear models are shown to be very successful in recreating various physical functions .",
    "linear models , e.g. @xmath7 with @xmath8 , should be thought of as leading approximation of a complete taylor series .",
    "if this is so , result derived from higher order in @xmath9 , e.g. @xmath10 terms , should only provide marginal contribution and hence can be ignored .",
    "if the higher order contribution is appreciable , one should be very careful in dealing with the truncated series . as a practical analysis",
    ", one should compute all related physical functions also as a power series order by order to obtain reliable observable according to the precision requirement .",
    "otherwise , unphysical contributions may build up and leave the final result invalid .",
    "fortunately , this complication may be unnecessary if the higher order contributions are small as compared to the leading order contribution .",
    "therefore , we try to extend the parametrization further to include the effect of higher orders of the series expansion results",
    ". related physical quantities are treated carefully order by order in order to extract more reliable information from these expansions .",
    "one also tries to determine the expansion coefficients from the fitting of the measured hubble parameters or energy density . as a result",
    ", one may reconstruct the series expansion of the equation of state and probe the nature and origin of the matter sources .",
    "finally , we will also present an error analysis to find the range of convergence and possible error control for a meaningful truncation .",
    "for example , the linear model given by @xmath11 fits the sugra result to a good precision at large @xmath6 even the linear model is already off @xmath12 when @xmath13@xcite .",
    "one can show that the next leading expansion coefficient with @xmath14 only provides at most @xmath15 error even when the redshift is close to 1100 . as a result",
    ", one can show that a reliable truncation is possible when the higher order expansion coefficient is small for all range @xmath16 up to the last scattering surface when @xmath17 . therefore , it does not matter much whether one sums up all power of @xmath9 coupled to the leading coefficients @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "in addition , the linear model @xmath20 approximates the inverse power law model very well at small @xmath9@xcite .",
    "similar analysis will also be shown in this paper for comparison .",
    "in addition , the evolution of the equation of state @xmath0 of the physical universe could be very complicate .",
    "indeed , the equation of state can be described by @xmath21 for many different effective theory with effective potential @xmath22 and scalar field @xmath23 .",
    "for example , @xmath24 and @xmath25 $ ] for inverse power law models and sugra models respectively@xcite . the nature of our physical universe may also consist of many other combinations of scalar fields contributions .",
    "it is therefore important for us to figure out which model plays the most important role in the expansion history of our universe . the linear model or leading approximation appears to be of help in determining the essential part of the nature of the equation of state and its corresponding effective theory .",
    "therefore a more detailed analysis on the convergence properties of various approximated models is very important as a research topic .",
    "since one is not sure about the nature of the function @xmath0 , the taylor series expanding @xmath26 into series sum with expansion parameter @xmath27 may also be used to determine leading expansion parameter with the help of future measurement . by fitting the hubble parameter measurements one could determine leading terms of the expansion coefficients @xmath27 . as a result",
    ", one would be able to reconstruct the recent evolution of the function @xmath0 to the better precision .",
    "we will present the complete analysis in this paper . since",
    "future observations will be able to provide tight constraint for only a few parameters in the near future , the material provides in this paper can be used to determine these parameters in a more reliable details .",
    "hopefully , future development of observation tools may provide deeper insight to determine more constraints in these theories .",
    "we will present , in section ii , a taylor series expansion of some physical models .",
    "one will explain the choices of the expansion variables which come from the integration involving @xmath28 .",
    "the convergence range of these expansion variables will also be presented . in section iii",
    ", we will also compute leading terms of the energy density function @xmath29 , the hubble parameter @xmath30 , and the conformal time @xmath31 for these expansions in order to discuss the difference between these approaches.(cf . @xcite and fig . 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "due to the fact that the parameter @xmath5 has a larger naive convergent range , this parameter could be more useful in large @xmath6 expansion .",
    "we also compute and analyze the convergence range of a linear model in section iv .",
    "the equation of state is defined by the relation @xmath32 . in addition",
    ", the field equations of the universe can be shown to be : @xmath33 for a flat frw universe with @xmath34 the redshift defined via @xmath35 .",
    "various linear models @xcite , @xcite have been suggested for the eos in the literatures .",
    "we will try to point out in this paper the relations between these linear models and go further to obtain a more complete leading - order expansions .",
    "taylor expansion is known to be one of the best ways to extract leading contributions from a generic theory with the help of a power series expansion of some suitable field variables .",
    "the taylor series is normally convergent quickly depending on the structure of the expansion coefficients .",
    "the power series will , however , converge quickly if the range of variable is properly chosen .",
    "hence it is important to choose an appropriate expansion variable for the purpose of our study .",
    "for example , one may expand the eos , assuming to be a smooth function for all @xmath6 , as a power series of the variable @xmath6 around the point @xmath36 .",
    "this will lead to the power series expansion : @xmath37 here the summation of @xmath38 runs from @xmath39 to @xmath40 and @xmath41 for any function @xmath42 . from now on ,",
    "the range of summation will be omitted for convenience throughout this paper unless it is different from the range from @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "one sees clearly that there are three useful and practical ways to expand the equation of state : @xmath6 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , from the structure of the conservation law given by eq .",
    "( [ eos ] ) .",
    "it turns out that the expansion parameters will become @xmath6 , @xmath45 , and @xmath44 respectively if one tends to expand the function @xmath0 about the point @xmath36 . in practical",
    ", we will expand the second choice with the parameter @xmath5 instead of @xmath45 for convenience .    in this section , one will first expand the eos as a power series of the variable @xmath46 around the point @xmath47 .",
    "the result is @xmath48    note that if we expand the eos as a power series of the variable @xmath49 around @xmath50 , we will end up with a similar power series : @xmath51    the taylor series are normally convergent quickly depending on the structure of the expansion coefficients .",
    "nonetheless , one would prefer to choose a more appropriate expansion parameter in order to make the series converge more rapidly . as a result",
    ", leading order terms will be enough to extract the most important physics from the underlying theory .",
    "therefore the advantage of the @xmath9 expansion is that the power series converges rapidly for all range of the parameter @xmath52 , or equivalently , @xmath53 as compared to the range @xmath54 for the power series expansion of @xmath6 shown in eq .",
    "( [ z ] ) .",
    "one notes , however , that one should also expand all physical quantities and the field equations to the same order of precision we adopted for the eos expansion .",
    "higher order contributions will not be reliable unless one can show that the higher order terms does not affect the physics very much .",
    "for example , the liner order is good enough for the expansion of the eos modelling sugra model @xcite .",
    "this is because that the linear term fits the predicted eos for sugra model to a very high precision .",
    "one readily realizes , however , that it is not easy to track the series expansion order by order due to the form of the eq .",
    "( [ eos ] ) for the eos for the @xmath9 expansion .",
    "this is because that after performing the integration , one needs to pay attention to the distorted integration result .",
    "indeed , one needs to write @xmath55 in order to perform the integration involving @xmath56 . indeed , one will need to recombine the result back to a power series of @xmath9 .",
    "the trouble is that the lower order terms could sometimes hide in the higher order terms in @xmath57",
    ". it may not be easy to track clearly the lower order @xmath9 expansion when we perform the expansion , for example , due to the exponential factor in the eq .",
    "( [ eos ] ) .",
    "therefore , one finds that the most natural way to expand the eos is to expand it in terms of the variable @xmath58 around the point @xmath59 .",
    "indeed , this power series can be shown to be : @xmath60 and this power series converge very rapidly in the range @xmath61 , or equivalently , @xmath62 . here",
    "@xmath63 is the natural factor .",
    "note that this limit happens to agree with the proposed scope of the snap mission .",
    "we will study these different power series expansion for the eos and its applications in the following sections .",
    "due to the structure of the differential equations ( [ eos ] ) , one finds that it will be easy for us to compute related taylor series by expanding @xmath0 either as functions of @xmath6 , or @xmath64 , or @xmath65 .",
    "therefore , we will present details of these expansion series in this section . for convenience",
    ", we will use repeated notation for the expansion series in this section for convenience and economics of notations .",
    "one should bear in mind that these coefficients are defined differently associated with different arguments @xmath9 , @xmath66 and @xmath6 defined in each subsection .",
    "note that the expansion parameter @xmath67 .",
    "therefore , the taylor series expansion around small @xmath9 is equivalent to a series expansion around @xmath68 .",
    "this is again a series expansion around the very recent universe near @xmath68 .",
    "the expansion series in @xmath9 has a naive convergence range for all @xmath69 which is defined to be the early universe with @xmath70 .",
    "we will show in details how to extract the leading terms in the @xmath9-expansion with @xmath71 around the point @xmath50 .",
    "one can write the expansion coefficient as @xmath72 such that the power series for the expansion of the eos becomes @xmath73 hence the eq .",

    "nonetheless , one expects that fitting for a few more leading terms in the taylor series will be able to provide us better information about the nature of the function @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , the result shown here is independent of the choice of the time @xmath231 .",
    "the local measurement of the expansion coefficients can be extended to the comparison of the expansion coefficients at any time .",
