    "the notorious ` twin paradox ' served , from the early days of relativity theory , to illustrate and elucidate what seemed to be the bizarreness of the theory in contrast with daily experience .",
    "as is well known , the classical ` twin paradox ' ( or ` clock paradox ' as a more formal title ) uses a round - trip scenario , comparing the proper - time lapses as measured along two different world - lines between the same events in which these world - lines intersect ( the spaceship s takeoff and eventual return to earth ) . in this way the association between clock reading , age  biological and physical age  and proper - time lapses was established , both conceptually and empirically ( _ e.g. _ , rindler @xcite p.64 ) .",
    "proper times may be defined and computed , therefore measured , as the lorentz - invariant minkowskian length of intervals on time - like world - lines .",
    "comparison of the proper - time lapses measured along two different world - lines can only be done between common events , intersections of these world - lines .",
    "let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be such intersections , and @xmath2 the world - line intervals between these events along the different world - lines ( see ) . then the proper - time lapses to be compared are the corresponding lengths of @xmath3 .",
    "both intervals can not be geodesic , since that would mean that the intervals coincide .",
    "therefore at least one of the world - lines must be nongeodesic . in the classical round - trip scenario",
    "one world - line is geodesic ( inertial ) while the other is not  it is accelerated , and being nongeodesic the corresponding proper - time lapse on it is shorter .",
    "but other scenarios , involving two nongeodesic world - lines , are possible .",
    "proper - times may be compared only between intersections of world - lines.,width=188 ]     space - time diagram showing an accelerated space - traveler s world - line as viewed relative to the earth s rest frame , starting from rest .",
    "the intervals between neighbouring dots correspond to equal proper - time lapses , but due to time dilation they seem to be growing larger.,width=188 ]    time - like world - lines correspond to point - like particles .",
    "point - like particles are idealizations  in reality we have extended systems whose different points move on different world - lines to which would correspond , in general , different proper - times , resulting in differential ageing within the system .",
    "how , then , can we discuss differential ageing in such systems ?",
    "is it possible to assign a common or representative proper - time for the whole system that may serve as its age ?    to illustrate the issue , let us consider the following alternative version for the ` twin paradox ' :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ in this story , both twins are astronauts , assigned for the same space mission , which is about to launch in a very long spaceship .",
    "one of them is located at the front end of the spaceship , the other at its rear end . while on earth , the brothers surely are the same age .",
    "the spaceship starts from rest , and after a while in space lands on a remote planet somewhere in the galaxy . as the spaceship comes to rest the brothers walk towards the centre of the spaceship where they meet .",
    "will they still be of the same age ? _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    this is a true ` twin story ' , since after the journey along different world - lines the brothers meet and can compare their ages . unlike the classical scenario , in which the traveling twin s spaceship may be assumed point - like , here the spaceship must be an extended body .",
    "it is therefore assumed that the spaceship is so designed that it remains rigid all through the voyage .",
    "the reason for this assumption is that the relativistic rigidity condition , first suggested by born in 1909 @xcite , requires all the parts of the body or system in question to be in any moment at rest relative to a common momentary inertial frame .",
    "another way to put it is that the distance between any two particles in the system must remain unchanged throughout the motion relative to an instantaneous inertial rest frame attached to any one of the two particles  a very reasonable requirement for a spaceship in voyage .",
    "how does rigidity determine the answer ?",
    "immediately after its inception , it was asserted by herglotz and noether @xcite that born s condition implies that accelerated rectilinear rigid motion is possible .",
    "for this situation to be maintained , different points along the spaceship must have different accelerations which are inter - related in a very specific way .",
    "it is assumed in the following that the issue of differential acceleration was solved by the engine design of the spaceship , so we need not be bothered by it .",
    "most of the discussions of relativistic linear rigid motion assumed constant proper accelerations ( see , _ e.g. _ rindler @xcite p.71 , franklin @xcite , and references therein ) implying hyperbolic motion .",
    "this is a convenient but un - necessary limitation , because by the herglotz - noether theorem @xcite the relativistic rigidity condition is satisfied , in rectilinear motion , also by time - varying accelerations .",
    "moreover , time varying accelerations allow a variety of scenarios , from one in which the spaceship launches from rest in one inertial reference frame and lands , coming to rest , in another inertial reference frame , to a round - trip scenario in which the acceleration can not remain constant throughout the whole journey .",
    "general , with possibly time - varying accelerations , linear rigid motion was explicitly discussed , in part , by kim and jo @xcite , but not in a lorentz covariant manner , and not referring to proper - times and ageing , which is our main interest here .",
    "age , like proper ( rest-)mass , is an object s intrinsic property , and should therefore be treated in a lorentz covariant manner .",
    "we therefore start ( ) considering linear relativistic rigid motion with general ( not - necessarily constant ) accelerations in fully lorentz covariant notation , which allows us to relate accelerations , velocities and proper - times of arbitrarily different points along the moving body . with these relations",
    "the proper - times of the two brothers are compared ( ) .",
    "differential ageing is computed , found to be proportional to the proper spatial distance between the two and to the rapidity difference between start to end .",
    "therefore , if the end station is moving relative to the home station , then the brothers do indeed end up with different ages , simply because of being located in remote parts of the spaceship .",
    "the transmission of signals between the astronauts is examined ( ) , establishing a relation between the relative doppler shift of these signals and the age difference .",
    "the issue of simultaneous arrival of simultaneously emitted signals is also discussed . the paper is concluded ( ) with implications for the possibility of assigning a common proper - time to complex relativistic systems , and a comment on the relation between the rigidity condition and simultaneity .    the convention @xmath4 is used throughout , except for equation .",
    "events in minkowski space - time are @xmath5 , and the metric tensor with positive signature @xmath6 , is assumed . for any 4-vectors @xmath7 and @xmath8 , their inner product is @xmath9 using einstein s summation convention .",
    "we start by discussing rectilinear rigid motion with time - varying proper accelerations in a lorentz - covariant manner .    to analyze the rigid motion of the spaceship it is convenient to choose an arbitrary reference point within the system .",
    "it defines a reference world - line @xmath10 with @xmath11 its proper - time , with the unit velocity 4-vector @xmath12 , the over - dot implying differentiation relative to @xmath11 .",
    "we recall that a proper - time element along a general world - line @xmath13 is defined via the minkowskian line element @xmath14 .",
    "alternatively , the proper - time @xmath15 may be defined as the time - like parameter for which the 4-velocity @xmath16 is always a unit 4-vector ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that although the following derivation requires a reference point , its choice is completely arbitrary , as is verified in the following , in particular in equations - .    at each point @xmath18 on the reference world - line an orthonormal spatial triad @xmath19 may be defined , spanning the 3-space orthogonal to @xmath20 , thus defining a 3-d reference frame attached to the spaceship .",
    "this is the simultaneity hyperplane relative to @xmath18 .",
    "together the orthonormal tetrad @xmath21 is defined with the relations @xmath22 any other point in the system may be defined relative to the reference world - line by a set of 3 constant distance parameters @xmath23 relative to the triad @xmath24 , @xmath25 being an index designating the particular point , thus invoking the rigidity condition .",
    "the relative minkowskian displacement @xmath26 which lies in the simultaneity hyperplane relative to @xmath27 defines the world - line of the @xmath25-th point @xmath28 the motion of the whole system is completely determined by that of the reference world - line and the triad @xmath24 attached to it . without loss of generality ,",
    "@xmath29 may be chosen in the direction of the 4-acceleration of the reference point , satisfying the relation @xmath30 .",
    "the scalar coefficient @xmath31 is the proper acceleration , @xmath32 or @xmath33 when the spaceship accelerates or decelerates , respectively . from the orthonormality conditions it follows that @xmath34 .",
    "the condition for rectilinear motion ( no spatial rotation ) @xmath35 allows @xmath36 to be directed only along @xmath37 , so that necessarily @xmath38 .",
    "the other two tetrad vectors @xmath39 correspond to displacements perpendicular to the spatial direction of motion , and without rotation are constant .",
    "therefore , finally , the equations of the tetrad @xmath21 are @xmath40 the prime result of applying the rigidity condition for rectilinear motion is that all the points in the simultaneity hyperplane do indeed move with the same velocity , or , in other words , at each moment there is an instantaneous rest frame common to all the points of the system : from equation it follows that @xmath41 .",
    "then , with @xmath42 the proper - time at the @xmath25-th point , the unit 4-velocity there is @xmath43 since both @xmath44 and @xmath37 are unit 4-velocities ( with @xmath45 ) , it follows that the coefficient of @xmath46 in the rhs of equation must be unity .",
    "therefore @xmath47 , and as a bonus we receive the relation between the proper - times , @xmath48 since the 4-velocities are identical at all the points in the simultaneity hyperplane , but not the proper - times , the accelerations are point - dependent : @xmath49 therefore , the accelerations at all the points are parallel ( as expected , necessarily , for rectilinear motion ) and entirely determined by the acceleration of the reference point .",
    "yet , it is important to show that the choice of the reference point is completely arbitrary : writing @xmath50 the reciprocal relation is easily obtained from , @xmath51 any two points in the same simultaneity hyperplane then satisfy the identity @xmath52 while this relation depends separately on the position parameters relative to the reference world - line @xmath53 and @xmath54 , it is possible , with some basic algebraic steps , to derive from equation another relation which depends only on the relative position of the two points , independent on the initial reference point : @xmath55 therefore , any point can be chosen as the reference point with the same result ",
    "there is no preferred point in the system .    back to the proper - times relation",
    ", we now use a basic relation between the proper acceleration , the proper - time and the rapidity @xmath56 ( the additive quantity in the superposition of co - linear velocities @xcite ) : consider a point particle moving linearly on the world - line @xmath57 , with fixed @xmath58 , relative to some inertial frame . with unit 4-velocity @xmath59 , with @xmath60 and @xmath61 ,",
    "its 4-acceleration is @xmath62 since @xmath63 is a space - like unit 4-vector , the proper acceleration @xmath64 , satisfying @xmath65 , is @xmath66 . from the rapidity definition follows @xmath67 , so that the relation @xmath68 which holds for all rectilinear motion , is obtained @xcite .    substituting eq . in",
    "therefore yields @xmath69 since all the points in any simultaneity hyperplane move with the same velocity , @xmath70 has the same value for all the spaceship parts on simultaneity hyperplanes .",
    "in fact , @xmath70 may be used to characterize and even parametrize the simultaneity hyperplanes .",
    "proper - times are defined up to an additive constant .",
    "therefore , assuming a starting simultaneity hyperplane where the proper - times are the same for all the spaceship points , equation is integrated for the explicit relation between the proper - times at the end of the journey , @xmath71 % \\ ] ] this result is obviously independent of the choice of the reference point @xmath72 and the particular details of the acceleration , since it also follows from eq . that the proper times at any two points on the spaceship later satisfy the relation @xmath73 recalling that rapidity differences",
    "are lorentz invariant insures the lorentz invariance of these results .",
    "finally , since the ratio or relative advancement of proper - times must be positive , so that @xmath74 for all points @xmath25 and all possible choices of the reference point , then follows from equation the condition @xmath75 or @xmath76 for all @xmath53 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath77 is the spaceship s length and the reference point chosen at its centre , then the condition reads @xmath78 . in practice",
    ", this upper bound is very high : writing @xmath79 explicitly , then even for @xmath80 we get @xmath81 .",
    "we are now ready to launch into the space voyage with the twin astronauts .",
    "let the length of the spaceship be @xmath77 , and let it start from rest while parking along a pier of the same length .",
    "of the two astronauts , let a be positioned at the rear of the spaceship and b positioned at the front .",
    "a s world - line may serve as the reference world - line , written in terms of the home - base coordinates as @xmath82 its unit 4-velocity is then @xmath59 , and initial conditions are assumed at @xmath83 : @xmath84 . following the relations in and around equation , the instantaneous simultaneity hyperplanes are defined by the space - like unit vector @xmath63 . then , with @xmath85 , b s world - line is @xmath86 for each value of @xmath87 , the events @xmath88 and @xmath89 correspond to different home - base times , but they are simultaneous relative to the spaceship ( more precisely , they lie on the same instantaneous simultaneity hyperplane ) . therefore , while @xmath90 , for the simultaneous ( relative to the spaceship ) b - event @xmath91 v(t ) \\ne t$ ] . considering both world - lines together , then",
    "@xmath87 should be regarded merely as a time - like parameter .",
    "the identity of the velocities on the simultaneity hyperplane is verified by the relation @xmath92}{d\\left [ t + l \\gamma(v ) v \\right ] } = \\frac{v + l v \\gamma^3(v ) ( dv / dt ) } { 1 + l \\gamma^3(v ) ( dv / dt ) } = v % \\ ] ] both world - lines are shown in the space - time diagram in .    as an illustration for these relations ,",
    "then for hyperbolic motion the world - lines are ( conveniently parametrized by the rapidity @xmath70 ) @xmath93 @xmath64 is a s proper acceleration , while @xmath94 is b s proper acceleration , and the proper - times are @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively .",

    "proper - times are measured as minkowskian length of world - line intervals , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , etc .",

    "the change in the inclination of the spaceship s position is evident , due to reversing the direction of motion . although the world - line intervals @xmath107 and @xmath108 look somewhat different , their minkowskian lengths ( proper - time lapses ) are equal .",
    "this diagram uses @xmath109 with @xmath110 to insure condition .,width=188 ]",
    "according to each point of the spaceship requires its own acceleration to maintain the assumed rigidity ; as the spaceship accelerates ( in the @xmath111 direction ) a suffers the highest acceleration , which gradually decreases along the spaceship in the direction of its motion . if the acceleration changes and the spaceship decelerates these relations reverse . then we should be aware of the fact that due to the obvious condition @xmath112 then follows from the condition @xmath113 in accordance with the discussion following equation .    at the home - base the spaceship starts from rest , so that @xmath114 and both twins start at the same age , @xmath115 . if the spaceship returns , eventually , to its home - base and lands there ( as illustrated by ) , then also @xmath116 , and both twin s ages are equal .",
    "but if the spaceship arrives at a remote star system which moves with velocity @xmath117 relative to the home - base , then it follows from that the twins proper - times differ : @xmath118 ( the light velocity @xmath79 is explicitly introduced in equation for the following computation ) .",
    "the proper - time difference is therefore determined in terms of the relative velocity between the two stations .",
    "as the spaceship lands and comes to rest in the end station the astronauts world - lines still do not intersect , them being situated at remote ends of the spaceship .",
    "but then they start walking towards each other ( presumably with the same speed relative to the station s rest frame ) , so the proper - time lapses between landing and their meeting is the same for both , and does nt change the proper - time difference which as we have now verified determines the age difference between the astronauts .",
    "although the difference is real , in practice it is very minute : let the spaceship be 1 km long and @xmath119 . then @xmath120 the effect is real , but hardly detectable .",
    "an interesting by - product of the foregoing discussion relates transmission of em signals between the astronauts and the differential ageing .",
    "suppose that the twins , wishing to entertain themselves during the long journey , start exchanging signals . let twin a , in the rear , send at some moment a signal to b in the front .",
    "we recall that at each moment there is an instantaneous inertial frame in which the spaceship is momentarily at rest .",
    "let us denote the instantaneous rest frame that corresponds to emitting the signal @xmath121 , and assume that the astronauts world - line relative to @xmath121 are given by and , so @xmath87 is the time as measured by the @xmath121-clocks for a. relative to @xmath121 , then , the emission event may be assumed to be @xmath122 .",

    "the physical meaning of these results is as follows : the spaceship arrives to state of rest relative to @xmath187 after the emission of the signals , but before their arrival to their targets . from the standpoint of @xmath187-observers , when the signals are emitted the spaceship is moving to the left with velocity @xmath206 ,",
    "then it slows down , comes to rest and then starts moving to the right , accelerating .",
    "the signals arrival is when the spaceship s velocity relative to @xmath187 is @xmath207 .",
    "because of the relative motion , neither the emission nor the arrival of the signals are simultaneous for the @xmath187-observers : comparison of and relative to @xmath187 , or lorentz transforming from the spaceship s momentary rest frames to @xmath187 , verifies that in terms of @xmath187-time @xmath208 , the emission from a precedes the emission from b with @xmath209 , while the arrival to b precedes the arrival to a by the same amount , @xmath210 . in other words , for the @xmath187-observers , the signal from b to a seems to be emitted and arriving before the corresponding events for the signal from a to b.",
    "this article offers a platform for a combined discussion of two of the fundamental issues of special relativity  the association of proper - time with age and relativistic rigid motion , while using the concepts inherent in the so called ` twin paradox ' .",
    "apart from the anecdotical aspect of suggesting and discussing a non - standard version for the ` twin paradox ' , this note emerged from a work which addressed the question of _ whether it is possible to assign the concept of common proper - time to complex , spatially extended , relativistic systems as a whole _ ; in particular , with the wish to use this common proper - time for the _ age _ of the system .    for a pointlike body ,",
    "the proper - time measurement is identical with the reading of a clock momentarily at rest with the body : an un - accelerated point particle may always be found at rest relative to some inertial frame , so the proper - time measurement for it is identical to the clock reading in that frame . otherwise , if accelerated , the proper - time lapse of the particle moving on the world - line @xmath211 is the integral @xmath212 along its world - line .",
    "since this is the only time measurement available for that particle , it must necessarily serve as the measure for its _ age_.    regarding the space mission , the twin astronauts may be regarded as pointlike bodies , while the spaceship was deliberately considered rigid to insure that there is always an inertial frame in which the whole spaceship is momentarily at rest . still , since lorentz transformation of time depends on the location , different parts of the system measure different proper - time lapses .",
    "extended systems consist of number of points , each defining a different world - line .",
    "even if the whole system may be found momentarily , simultaneously , at rest , still different proper - times , different ages , are measured at different points .",
    "also , it is not possible to identify , at least not from kinematical considerations alone , a preferred point which may serve to define the common proper - time for the whole system : verifies that in this sense all the points of the system are equivalent .",
    "it is noted that the present version of the ` twin paradox ' , which really is not a paradox at all , is closely related to another famous relativity ` paradox ' , the so - called ` bell s spaceships paradox ' @xcite ( which is also not a paradox at all ) . to fit our story with bell s",
    "we could have used , instead of the long spaceship , two small spaceships connected by a long rigid rod , but this is an un - essential difference .",
    "bell s ` paradox ' was recently discussed by franklin @xcite , who , among other things , also compared the minkowskian times of the right and left spaceships ( or brothers ) which are obviously the same in any instantaneous rest frame .",
    "however , the _ ages _ of the brothers are determined not by the minkowskian times but by the proper - times measured along their ( separate ) space - time trajectories .",
    "as we have seen , the result is that if the end station is moving relative to the home station , then the brothers do indeed end up with different ages , simply because of being located in remote parts of the spaceship .",
    "this marks a difference between the existence of momentary rest frames for the whole ( extended ) system , on the one hand , and the possibility of assigning a common proper time for the whole system , on the other hand .",
    "we end with a comment regarding the significance of assuming rigid motion in this type of ` twins paradox ' scenario .",
    "the rigidity condition implies , by definition , that the relative distance between the space travelers be maintained constant relative to themselves .",
    "the requirement to maintain constant relative distance is introduced to provide means to compare the ages  proper - times  of the twins after the journey .",
    "these distances are compared between events on the twins world - lines that are simultaneous in some inertial reference frame . in the rigidity condition",
    "these are the twins momentary rest frames , but in principle it is possible to envisage using also other frames for the simultaneity .    as an example , a similar but different ` twin paradox ' scenario was proposed by boughn @xcite . in this scenario",
    "the two twins sit in point - like spaceships , initially at rest in some inertial reference frame s , separated distance @xmath77 apart .",
    "they start together their journey and supposed to follow the same plan relative to the home - base , so their world - lines , in s coordinates , are @xmath213 where @xmath157 describes some non - uniform motion .    here",
    "the requirement that the twins maintain constant relative distance is assumed to hold simultaneously relative to the home - base reference frame s , which is a fixed inertial frame .",
    "but for the astronauts themselves this simultaneity is irrelevant  they can only measure distances , velocities and accelerations relative to themselves , _",
    "i.e. _ , in an inertial frame in which they are momentarily at rest .",
    "therefore , for twin a at the event @xmath214 , the simultaneous b - event in the scenario is not @xmath215 but rather @xmath216 determined by the simultaneity condition @xmath217 \\cdot \\frac{dx_{\\rm a}^\\mu \\left ( t \\right)}{dt } = 0   \\quad \\rightarrow \\quad   \\bar t - t = \\left [ x\\left ( \\bar t \\right ) + l - x\\left ( t \\right ) \\right ] \\cdot v\\left ( t \\right ) \\ , .",
    "% \\ ] ] since @xmath218 then also @xmath219 , each twin sees the other moving , and actually being accelerated relative to him / her . the only way that the relative distance may be regarded constant by the twins relative to themselves is , therefore , in rigid motion .              born m 1909 die theorie des starren elektrons in der kinematik des relativittsprinzips ( the theory of the rigid electron in the kinematics of the principle of relativity ) _ annalen der physik _ * 335 ( 11 ) * 1 - 56    herglotz g 1910 ber den vom standpunkt des relativittsprinzips aus als starr zu bezeichnenden krper ( on bodies that are to be designated as `` rigid '' from the standpoint of the relativity principle ) _ annalen der physik _ * 336 ( 2 ) * 393 - 415 noether f 1910 zur kinematik des starren krpers in der relativtheorie _ annalen der physik _ * 336 ( 5 ) * 91944            bell b s 1993 _ speakable and unspeakable in quantum mechanics _",
