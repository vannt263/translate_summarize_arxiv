    "hadronic decays of the @xmath0 lepton are very important for studying qcd phenomena at a low - energy scale . various decay modes including an @xmath1-meson represent a wide class of such decays , which are still poorly studied",
    ". one of the important tasks in this field is to test effective chiral theories @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 decay amplitudes in these theories are based on an effective lagrangian of pseudoscalar , vector and axial - vector mesons with @xmath14 symmetry . on the other hand , for some decays",
    "the branching fractions as well as spectral functions of the final states can be predicted using the vector dominance model ( vdm ) .",
    "another important issue is testing the relations between the cross section of @xmath15 and the spectral function in @xmath16 decay predicted by conservation of vector current ( cvc ) and isospin symmetry  @xcite .",
    "for all of the above tasks , precise measurements of the branching fractions as well as detailed studies of the final - state invariant mass distributions are highly desirable .",
    "three @xmath0-decay modes involving @xmath1 mesons , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath16 , have been studied by cleo  @xcite and aleph  @xcite . however , the experimental statistics were very limited .",
    "for example , cleo has the most precise measurements with 85 events in the @xmath17 mode , 125 events in the @xmath16 mode and 25 in the @xmath19 mode .",
    "the limited statistics of these measurements result in large uncertainties for the branching fractions and do not allow study of the hadronic mass spectra .",
    "we report a detailed study of the branching fractions for @xmath17 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , as well as @xmath22 decays . the @xmath23 invariant mass in the @xmath24 decay and the @xmath25 invariant mass in the @xmath22 decay",
    "are studied to evaluate the branching fraction of the @xmath26 decay .",
    "in addition , some other final - state invariant mass distributions are presented and discussed .",
    "this study was performed at the kekb asymmetric - energy @xmath3 collider  @xcite with the belle detector .",
    "the results are based on a 490 fb@xmath2 data sample that contains about 450 million @xmath0-pairs , which is almost 100 times larger than in any of the previous measurements .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ belledet ] describes the belle detector .",
    "event selection is explained in section  [ eventselection ] .",
    "the branching fractions are determined in section  [ br1 ] , where that of @xmath26 is evaluated from analysis of the @xmath27 and @xmath22 samples in section  [ br2 ] .",
    "finally , some concluding remarks are given in section  [ conclusion ] .",
    "the belle detector is a large - solid - angle magnetic spectrometer that consists of a silicon vertex detector ( svd ) , a 50-layer central drift chamber ( cdc ) , an array of aerogel threshold cherenkov counters ( acc ) , a barrel - like arrangement of time - of - flight scintillation counters ( tof ) , and an electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecl ) comprised of csi(tl ) crystals located inside a superconducting solenoid coil that provides a 1.5  t magnetic field .",
    "an iron flux - return located outside the coil is instrumented to detect @xmath28 mesons and to identify muons ( klm ) . the detector is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "two inner detector configurations were used .",
    "a 2.0 cm radius beam pipe and a 3-layer silicon vertex detector were used for the first sample of 140  fb@xmath2 , while a 1.5 cm radius beam pipe , a 4-layer silicon detector and a small - cell inner drift chamber were used to record the remaining 350  fb@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "particle identification ( pid ) of the charged tracks uses likelihood ratios , @xmath29 , for a charged particle of species @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "@xmath29 is defined as @xmath32 ( the sum runs over the relevant particle species ) , where @xmath33 is a likelihood based on the energy deposit and shower shape in the ecl , the momentum and @xmath34 measured in the cdc , the particle range in the klm , the light yield in the acc , and the particle s time - of - flight from the tof counter  @xcite .",
    "the efficiencies for kaon , muon and electron identification are 77% for momenta of @xmath35 gev/@xmath36 , 92% for @xmath37 gev/@xmath36 and 94% for @xmath38 gev/@xmath36 , respectively .",
    "the detection efficiency for each signal mode and the level of background ( bg ) contribution are estimated from monte carlo ( mc ) simulations . to generate signal events as well as @xmath0-decay backgrounds ,",
    "the kkmc program @xcite is used . for the decay modes not covered by kkmc , like @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 ,",
    "the signal mc is produced assuming a pure phase - space distribution of the hadronic system with a @xmath42 weak interaction .",
    "the background from @xmath43 ( @xmath44 continuum ) is simulated using the evtgen procedure @xcite .",
    "the detector response is simulated by a geant3 @xcite based program . throughout the paper",
    "the efficiencies quoted include the branching ratios of the corresponding @xmath1 decays .",
    "the signal events should have the following common features in the @xmath45 reaction : @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes @xmath48 , @xmath23 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 or @xmath51 systems .",
    "the @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath51 are reconstructed through @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 decays , respectively .",
    "the @xmath1 meson is identified through the @xmath57 decay mode for all @xmath0 channels while the @xmath58 mode is added for the @xmath59 decay mode .",
    "the signal events , therefore , comprise either two or four charged tracks with zero net charge and two or four @xmath60 s . in order to take into account initial - state radiation , we allow at most one extra @xmath60 on both the signal and tag sides . each charged track is required to have a transverse momentum @xmath61 gev/@xmath36 , and a polar angle of @xmath62 , where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are measured relative to the direction opposite to that of the incident @xmath65 beam in the laboratory frame .",
    "each photon candidate should have an energy @xmath66 gev within the same polar angle region as for the charged particles .",
    "the tag - side @xmath67 is required to decay into leptons , i.e. @xmath68 @xmath69 , which corresponds to a branching fraction of 35.2%  @xcite .",
    "the lepton candidates are required to be well identified by requirements on the @xmath70 or @xmath71 pid parameters with @xmath72 gev/@xmath36 .    the thrust axis ( @xmath73 ) is defined to maximize @xmath74 , where @xmath75 denotes the momentum of each particle in the center - of - mass system ( cm ) , and the sum runs over all detected particles in an event .",

    "<S> we have studied hadronic @xmath0 decay modes involving an @xmath1 meson using 490 fb@xmath2 of data collected with the belle detector at the kekb asymmetric - energy @xmath3 collider . </S>",
    "<S> the following branching fractions have been measured : @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> these results are substantially more precise than previous measurements . </S>",
    "<S> the new measurements are compared with theoretical calculations based on the cvc hypothesis or the chiral perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> we also set upper limits on branching fractions for @xmath0 decays into @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and non - resonant @xmath13 final states .    </S>",
