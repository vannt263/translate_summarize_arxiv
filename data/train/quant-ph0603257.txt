    "bosonic gaussian channels provide a realistic noise model for transmission lines which employ photons as information carriers including optical fibers , wave guides , and free - space e.m . communication .",
    "they account for all processes where the transmitted signals undergo loss , amplification , and/or squeezing transformations  @xcite .",
    "the characterization of these transmission lines is relevant not only from a technological point of view but also from the point of view of quantum information theory where they pose some important open problems ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "for instance , in the context of average input photon number constraint , it is believed that the optimal ( classical or quantum ) communication rates  @xcite of such channels should be achieved by encoding messages into gaussian input states  @xcite .",
    "however , apart from the noiseless case  @xcite , the only nontrivial map for which such conjecture has been proved is the purely lossy channel where the information carrying photons couple through beam splitters with an external vacuum state ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the classical capacity  @xcite case and refs .",
    "@xcite for the entangled assisted capacities ) .",
    "finally bosonic gaussian channels are generally believed  @xcite to provide a natural example of maps with additive properties  @xcite ( e.g. , it has been conjectured that their maximum holevo information and minimum rnyi entropies should be additive ) although only preliminary results have been obtained  @xcite so far . in this paper",
    "we discuss a property which has some relevant implications in the analysis of the quantum capacity @xmath0  @xcite of a large class of one - mode bosonic gaussian channels .",
    "indeed we show that these maps are either _ weakly degradable _ or _ anti - degradable_. the notions of weak - degradability and anti - degradability of a channel are introduced here as a generalization of the degradability property defined by devetak and shor  @xcite . on one hand , using an argument of refs .",
    "@xcite , one can show that anti - degradable channels have null quantum capacity .",
    "on the other hand , it is known that channels which are degradable in the sense of ref .",
    "@xcite possess additive coherent information which allows one to express their quantum capacity , @xmath0 , in terms of a single - letter formula .",
    "the latter is much easier to handle than its regularized version and , in some cases , allows for a complete characterization of the @xmath0 ( e.g. , see the dephasing channel in ref .",

    "weakly degradable maps do not necessarily share the above property ( at present , however , we do not have a counter - example of this fact ) .",
    "still , as will be clear in the following , weak - degradability provides a necessary condition for degradability and for some of the maps analyzed here the two notions coincide . in what follows , we first present the formal definitions of weak - degradability and anti - degradability ( see sec .",

    "important property is the fact that maps which are unitarily equivalent to a weakly degradable channel are also weakly degradable ( analogously for anti - degradability ) .",
