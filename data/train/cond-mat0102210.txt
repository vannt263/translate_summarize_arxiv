    "the kondo model and its periodic extension , the kondo lattice model ( klm ) , which describe spin - exchange interaction between a localized spin or a system of localized spins , respectively , and a band of itinerant electrons , has been subject of intense theoretical studies in the past  @xcite .",
    "this model has been applied to a variety of different problems in solid - state physics using both a ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic coupling constant @xmath2 .",
    "the model with @xmath0 is the one originally known as _ kondo lattice model _ or simply _ kondo model _ in its non - periodic form with a single impurity spin in the system .",
    "it was used by kondo to explain the unusual temperature behavior of the resistivity of magnetic impurities in non - magnetic hosts  @xcite .",
    "the negative spin - exchange interaction can be derived from the hybridization of a correlated `` atomic '' level with a conduction band , the situation described by the anderson model  @xcite . in the limit of a low - lying half - filled atomic level and strong correlations ,",
    "the anderson model can be mapped onto the kondo model with a negative exchange constant  @xcite .",
    "the kondo lattice model is still subject to much theoretical work , the main objective is the understanding of the unusual physical behavior found in _ heavy - fermion _ materials  @xcite .    a model with identical operator structure in the hamiltonian , but with positive",
    "exchange constant has been known in the literature for a long time by many different names ( double exchange model , @xmath3-@xmath4 model , @xmath3-@xmath5 model ,  )  @xcite . for clarity",
    ", we will refer to this model in the following as _",
    "ferromagnetic kondo lattice model_. the model with ferromagnetic exchange has to be understood as an effective one .",
    "the origins of the exchange with @xmath1 are found in the interband coulomb correlations  @xcite .",
    "this situation is believed to dominate the physical properties of important systems such as the magnetic semiconductors  @xcite ( eux ; x = o , s , se , te ) , the diluted magnetic semiconductors  @xcite ( cd@xmath6mn@xmath7te , hg@xmath6fe@xmath7se ) , and the `` local moment '' metals  @xcite ( gd , dy , tb ) .",
    "to these problems , the ferromagnetic klm was successfully applied  @xcite .",
    "recently , this variant of the klm has gained a lot of interest with the discovery of the colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) materials  @xcite . in these materials , typically manganese oxides with perovskite structure ( la@xmath6(ca , sr)@xmath7mno@xmath8 ) ,",
    "the double - exchange model  @xcite has been successfully applied to explain the origin of ferromagnetic order and is expected to be a good starting point to investigate the resistivity anomalies  @xcite .",
    "this double - exchange model , however , is nothing else than the kondo lattice model with ferromagnetic ( positive ) exchange constant in the strong coupling limit . in the cmr materials , the localized @xmath9-spin of the model represents the more or less localized manganese @xmath10-@xmath11 electrons , whereas the conduction band is formed by the @xmath12 electrons .",
    "the interband - exchange interaction is nothing else but the intra - shell hund s rule coupling .",
    "since the @xmath10-@xmath12 electrons of the manganese form a relatively narrow band ( theoretical results from band - structure calculations : @xmath13  @xcite and experimental estimates : @xmath14  @xcite ) and hund s coupling is assumed to be large , the model has to be taken in the intermediate to strong coupling regime .",
    "there are few estimates about the value of the interaction constant in the literature , e.g.  @xmath15  @xcite , but these are challenged as to be too small  @xcite .",
    "most theoretical papers of the last years concerned with colossal magnetoresistance assume classical spins @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "this has been justified by the assumption of @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "although it is true that the important energy scale is @xmath18 , there are much more implications of @xmath16 that are not justified in the strong - coupling limit for a @xmath9 system . in several papers",
    ", it was stated that `` ",
    "the @xmath12 electrons are oriented parallel to the @xmath11 spins . ''",
    "@xcite or equivalently ``  so one only need consider configurations with @xmath12 electrons parallel to core spins . ''  @xcite",
    ". we will show below using exact results as well as several well - defined approximation methods , that for @xmath9 there is a considerable amount of spin-@xmath19 spectral weight located in the main region of the spin-@xmath20 states even for large interaction strengths .",
    "the assumption of a half - metallic state  @xcite , made in the two citations above can therefore never be met in the klm with quantum spins and is merely an effect of the ( unphysical ) limit of `` classical '' spins .",
    "the recently discussed half - metallic behaviour of the manganites  @xcite must have a different origin .    however , for the opposite sign of @xmath2 , exactly the assumed effect happens in the strong - coupling limit : the lowest - lying excitations in the conduction band density of states will be purely spin-@xmath19 .",
    "this already implies that results for the kondo lattice model with @xmath1 and @xmath0 can not simply be reverted into the respective other case .",
    "the change of sign changes the whole physics of the system . for @xmath21 an antiparallel ( `` antiferromagnetic '' ) alignment of the conduction band spin and the localized spin lowers the internal energy . for a sufficient band filling",
    ", this tends to a screening of the local moments by conduction electrons , well - known from the kondo effect that refers to a single magnetic impurity in a conduction electron sea . from this , the name `` kondo lattice model '' was originally derived for the @xmath0 case .",
    "we will further show that already for comparatively low interaction strengths the spin - exchange interaction alone leads to an opening of a gap in the density of states .",
    "this extraordinary correlation effect could give hints to the explanation of a recently discovered pseudogap in the managese oxides  @xcite .    to prove our claims already laid out so far",
    ", we will first review two important non - trivial exactly solvable limiting cases of the kondo lattice model in sec .",
    "[ sec : theo ] .",
    "the first is the _ zero - bandwidth limit _ ( `` atomic limit '' ) where the bandwidth of the conduction band is set to @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "the second exactly solvable limiting case is the so - called _ ferromagnetically saturated semiconductor _  @xcite .",
    "this is essentially the zero - temperature limit of the model with vanishing electron density and fully aligned spin system . in this limit",
    ", striking correlation effects can be observed and discussed .",
    "these limiting cases will already give clear evidence to our propositions made above . in sec .",
    "[ sec : dmft ] we will present a new _ dynamical mean - field theory _ (",
    "dmft)-based approach for the klm with @xmath23 spins .",
    "to circumstantiate our theory , we will introduce three more approximation schemes which also keep the spin as a quantum variable , not relying on the classical spin limit .",
    "the first will be a _",
    "second - order perturbation theory _ ( sopt ) for the klm based on the projector operator formalism  @xcite .",
    "the _ self - consistent cpa _",
    "( coherent potential approximation ) is a straightforward extension to the well - known cpa for the klm  @xcite .",
    "it starts from the zero - bandwidth limit discussed before .",
    "the third approximation method is a moment - conserving decoupling procedure for the equation of motion of the single - electron green function .",
    "this approximation scheme continuously evolves from the exactly solvable limit of the ferromagnetically saturated semiconductor .",
    "it will be called _ moment - conserving decoupling approximation _ ( mcda ) . the comparison of the results obtained by these three methods and our dmft scheme , each of which starts from a different limit allows to evaluate the range of applicability of the new approach , and to select the most trustworthy common features of all methods to gain a reliable picture of the physics of the ferromagnetic klm .",
    "the kondo - lattice model ( or @xmath3-@xmath5 model ) traces back the characteristic features of the underlying physical system to an interband exchange coupling of itinerant conduction electrons to ( quasi- ) localized magnetic moments described by the following model hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath24 @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) and @xmath27 are , respectively , creation and annihilation operators of a band electron being specified by the lower indices .",
    "the hopping integrals @xmath28 are connected by fourier transformation to the single - electron bloch energies @xmath29 .",
    "the interband ( @xmath30 ) exchange with coupling strength @xmath2 is taken as an intra - atomic interaction between the conduction electron spin @xmath31 and the localized magnetic moment represented by the spin operator @xmath32 . for practical reasons",
    "it is sometimes convenient to use the second quantization representation of the band electron spin @xmath31 which leads to the following form of the interband - interaction term : @xmath33 here we have used the abbreviations @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "the first term in ( [ eq : hamil - sf_2 ] ) describes an ising - like interaction between the z - components of the spin - operators , while the second term incorporates spin exchange processes between the localized and the itinerant system .",
    "the last two terms are an extension to the original model : @xmath37 leads to the correlated kondo lattice model , it introduces correlations between the conduction electrons in form of a hubbard - type interaction .",
    "we will include this term in some parts of the discussion below .",
    "the second term , @xmath38 represents a direct spin - exchange between localized moments on different lattice sites . although the @xmath30 exchange can lead to an effective rkky interaction between the spins for non - vanishing band occupation , a",
    "`` superexchange''could also be included . in case of an empty conduction band ,",
    "this term becomes essential as source of magnetic order .",
    "@xmath39 are the superexchange integrals .",
    "we state once more that the original kondo - lattice model ( or @xmath3-@xmath5 model ) is defined by @xmath40 , only .",
    "the additional terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) are used as soon as physical requirements do not allow to neglect them .",
    "if we are mainly interested in the conduction electron properties then the single - electron green function @xmath41 is of primary interest .",
    "its equation of motion reads for the correlated klm @xmath42 the two types of interaction terms in  ( [ eq : hamil - sf_2 ] ) let appear the `` spinflip function '' @xmath43 and the `` ising function '' @xmath44 , while the `` hubbard - function '' @xmath45 comes into play only when the `` hubbard - interaction '' ( last term in eq .  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) ) is switched on .    the three `` higher '' green functions on the right - hand side of eq .  (",
    "[ eq : eom ] ) prevent a direct solution of the equation of motion .",

    "let us discuss in the next sections two rather illustrative limiting cases which can help to test the unavoidable approximations .",
    "let us assume that the arbitrarily filled conduction band is shrinked to an @xmath49-fold degenerate level @xmath50 : @xmath51 .",
    "nevertheless , we consider the @xmath5-spin system as collectively ordered for @xmath52 by any direct or indirect exchange interaction . in this case",
    ", the hierarchy of equations of motion decouples exactly and can rigorously be solved  @xcite .",
    "the resulting energies and respective spectral weights are @xmath53 the `` hubbard - u '' in @xmath54 and @xmath55 indicates that these excitations are bound to a double occupancy of the respective lattice site . @xmath56 and @xmath57",
    "appear when our `` test electron '' enters an empty site .",
    "if it orients its spin parallel to the local @xmath5-spin then the energy @xmath56 is needed . in case of an antiparallel spin orientation a triplet or a singlet state",
    "is formed .",
    "the first requires the energy @xmath56 , the second @xmath57 .",
    "the latter is therefore two - fold degenerate .",
    "the spectral weights are , contrary to the energy levels , strongly dependent on the magnetization state of the @xmath5 system and the band filling . for a complete solution one needs the average occupation number @xmath58 and the mixed correlation functions @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the evaluation can selfconsistently be done by use of the spectral theorem for the green functions @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( cf .",
    "it is interesting to observe that in any case from the four poles only three do appear . for less than half - filled bands and @xmath1 ( @xmath0 ) @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) vanishes , and for more than half - filled @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) does .",
    "it should be mentioned that the spectral weights @xmath68 do not explicitly depend on the coupling constants @xmath2 and @xmath69 .",
    "that means , on the one side , that even for @xmath70 the @xmath3-@xmath5 interaction produces a splitting into four not coinciding quasiparticle levels . on the other hand",
    ", there is a striking dependence of @xmath71 and @xmath58 on the sign of the @xmath3-@xmath5 coupling .",
    "that transfers to the spectral weights giving them some indirect dependence on @xmath72 . for @xmath73 and @xmath21",
    "the order of the energy levels is different resulting via the spectral theorem in different correlation functions .",
    "note that the mentioned dependence on @xmath2 concerns only the sign of @xmath2 .",
    "the spectral weights are not influenced by the absolute value @xmath74 .",
    "there is another very instructive limiting case that can be treated rigorously .",
    "it concerns the situation of a single electron in an otherwise empty conduction band at @xmath75 , when the local moment system is ferromagnetically saturated . in this case",
    "the coulomb interaction is meaningless , the `` hubbard - function '' @xmath76 is identical to zero . in the zero - bandwidth limit , discussed in the last section , for the @xmath20-spectrum all spectral weights disappear except for @xmath77 , while for the @xmath19-spectrum the levels @xmath56 and @xmath57 survive with @xmath78 and @xmath79 .    for finite bandwidth",
    "the mentioned special case is that of a ferromagnetically saturated semiconductor  @xcite . in this case , the spin-@xmath20 quasiparticle density of states @xmath80 is only rigidly shifted compared to the `` free '' bloch density of states .",
    "@xmath81 consequently , the quasiparticle dispersion is undeformed with respect to the bloch energies , @xmath82 .",
    "spectral densities ( quasiparticle bandstructures ) of the ferromagnetically saturated semiconductor for @xmath23 and @xmath2 as indicated along several symmetry directions . the left ( right ) column displays the @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) case , the top - most picture shows the interaction - free spectral density.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the @xmath19-spectrum is more complicated because a @xmath19-electron has several possibilities to exchange its spin with the antiparallel @xmath5 spins . therefore , the @xmath83-spinflip function is not at all trivial .",
    "however , its equation of motion decouples exactly , producing a closed system of equations which can be solved after fourier transformation for the single - electron green function .",
    "the corresponding selfenergy @xmath84 reads : @xmath85 @xmath86 are the spin wave energies following from the heisenberg exchange @xmath38 ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) ) , @xmath87 .",
    "@xmath88 is the fourier transform of the exchange integral @xmath39 . usually the spin wave energies will be smaller by about two orders of magnitude than other typical energies of the system as the exchange constant @xmath2 or the bloch bandwidth @xmath89 .",
    "as a general result the spectral density @xmath90 consists of two structures corresponding to special elementary excitation processes of the @xmath19 electron . there is a rather broad structure built up by `` scattering states '' which result from magnon emission by the original @xmath19 electron .",
    "thereby the excited electron reverses its spin becoming a @xmath20 electron .",
    "such a process is possible only if there are @xmath20 band states within reach for the original @xmath19 electron to land after the spinflip .",
    "the scattering states therefore occupy the same energy region as the @xmath20-dos ( [ eq : ro_up_magpol ] ) .",
    "there is another possibility for the @xmath19 electron to flip its spin .",
    "it can also be done by a repeated emission and reabsorption of a magnon by the conduction electron resulting in a `` dressed '' particle propagating through the lattice accompanied by a virtual cloud of magnons . for not too small positive ( negative ) @xmath2 the energy of this `` dressed '' particle lies above ( below ) the scattering spectrum giving even rise to a bound state , i.e.  to a quasiparticle with infinite lifetime which we call the `` magnetic polaron '' . outside the scattering region",
    "the polaron peak manifests itself as a @xmath91-function .",
    "as soon as the peak dips into the scattering part the polaron gets a finite lifetime after which it decays into a @xmath20 electron plus magnon .",
    "figure  [ fig : mag_pol_spec ] shows the down - spin quasiparticle bandstructure as derived from the respective spectral density as a density plot .",
    "the degree of blackening is a measure of the spectral density magnitude .",
    "sharp dark lines refer to pronounced peaks in the spectral density representing quasiparticles with long life - time . for weak coupling @xmath92 scattering processes smear out a little bit the `` free '' dispersion but do not lead to strong deformations .",
    "however , already for moderate couplings @xmath93 one recognizes for some @xmath94 vectors the appearance of a sharp polaron dispersion . for @xmath1 ( right column )",
    "the magnetic polaron is stable on the high - energy side of the @xmath20 spectrum , for @xmath0 on the low - energy side .",
    "in addition the scattering spectrum is clearly visible taking away a great part of the total spectral weight . in the antiferromagnetic",
    "klm the magnetic polaron represents the ground state configuration  @xcite . for still rather moderate couplings of @xmath95 the polaron dispersion has split off over the full brillouin zone .",
    "the magnetic polaron has an infinite lifetime .",
    "it is surprising that even the broad scattering structure is obviously bunched together as if it were a rather stable quasiparticle .",
    "it is noteworthy to repeat that the results of fig .",
    "[ fig : mag_pol_spec ] are exact and free of any uncontrollable approximation .",
    "so we have to expect these quasiparticle effects in real systems , too .",
    "this holds also for the quasiparticle density of states ( qdos ) plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mag_pol_dos ] for several exchange couplings @xmath74 . according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : ro_up_magpol ] ) the @xmath20-qdos is only rigidly shifted to higher ( lower ) energies for @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "correlation effects appear exclusively in the @xmath19 spectrum . for @xmath96 a band splitting sets in .",
    "one of the subbands occupies the same energy region as @xmath80 being therefore built up by the mentioned scattering states . in the ferromagnetic ( @xmath1 ) klm it is the low energy part of the spectrum containing a considerable amount of @xmath19-spectral weight .",
    "this is not a specialty of the @xmath23 case or of weak and moderate couplings exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig : mag_pol_dos ] but holds equivalently , e.g. , for @xmath9 and in the strong coupling region ( @xmath97 , see last row in fig .",
    "[ fig : mag_pol_dos ] ) .",
    "after the band splitting has set in the weights of the two spin-@xmath19 subbands are close to the zero - bandwidth values @xmath98 for the lower , and @xmath99 for the upper part ( @xmath1 ) , i.e.  independent of @xmath2 .",
    "the very often used assumption , when the klm is applied to the manganites , that the @xmath12 electron orients its spin parallel to the @xmath11-@xmath9 spin  @xcite , appears with respect to the exact results in fig .",
    "[ fig : mag_pol_dos ] rather questionable . in the antiferromagnetic ( @xmath0 )",
    "klm the low energy quasiparticle subband consists of stable polaron states which build the high energy part in the ferromagnetic ( @xmath1 ) klm .",
    "although the @xmath1-qdos and the @xmath0-qdos appear as mirror - images the implied physics turns out to be rather different .",
    "it is not possible to directly apply the methods of the dynamical mean - field theory  @xcite to the klm .",
    "one exception is the case of the classical - spin limit ( @xmath16 )  @xcite , thus removing the quantum nature of the spins .",
    "the effect of quantum mechanics is strongest for @xmath23 , but also for @xmath100 , they dramatically influence the spectrum  @xcite . the assumption of classical spins for @xmath9 , as done in refs .",
    "@xcite , needs therefore careful analysis of the neglected effects .",
    "another possibility to derive a dynamical mean - field theory for the kondo lattice model is the fermionization of the localized spin operators as suggested in  @xcite .",
    "this approach is , however limited to @xmath23 systems ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the first part of our approach will closely follow ref .",
    "@xcite , but as discussed below , will then differ from the cited reference .",
    "the localized spins in the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) can be expressed in terms of auxiliary fermion operators @xmath101 ( @xmath102 )  @xcite : @xmath103 here , @xmath104 represents the pauli matrices .",
    "this is the same transformation that led to  ( [ eq : hamil - sf_2 ] ) where it was applied to the conduction electron spin @xmath31 .",
    "the `` fermionization '' according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : fermionization ] ) implies the introduction of the constraint : @xmath105 the inclusion of this constraint via a lagrange formalism corresponds to the addition of a hubbard - like interaction term for the @xmath5-fermions to the hamiltonian with the interaction constant @xmath106  @xcite .",
    "the one - particle energy of the @xmath5-fermions is located at @xmath107 .",
    "the `` fermionized klm '' takes the form : @xmath108 this hamiltonian describes a system of two different kinds of @xmath23 fermions coupled by a local spin - exchange interaction .",
    "the @xmath5-fermions are additionally correlated via the hubbard - type of interaction to prevent double - occupancy .",
    "this hamiltonian resembles the periodic anderson model ( pam )  @xcite in some way .",
    "in fact the only difference in the operator structure is the `` coupling '' between conduction band and @xmath5 state . in the pam ,",
    "this is simply a kinetic - energy term ( `` hybridization '' ) , whereas here , the two subsystems are coupled by the spin exchange . essentially , the `` fermionized klm '' is a rudimentary version of the general multi - band hubbard model with ( local ) inter - band interaction . for this model ,",
    "the dmft is discussed by  @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to apply the standard methods of the dmft to map model  ( [ eq : klm+u ] ) onto an appropriate impurity model with the corresponding self - consistency condition to determine the parameters of the impurity model .",
    "this leads to the following hamiltonian for the impurity model ( single - site kondo model , sskm ) with fermionized @xmath5-spins : @xmath109 with only one `` impurity '' site for the @xmath5-fermions .",
    "the spin - exchange interaction acts only at this single site denoted by the site - index @xmath110 .",
    "it is advisable to express the conduction band part of hamiltonian  ( [ eq : sskm-1 ] ) in local space and single out the operators referring to the impurity site @xmath110 : @xmath111 for better readability , we will denote the construction operators at the site @xmath110 with the symbol @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) , the on - site energy will be denoted @xmath114 .",
    "finally we introduce a unitary transformation which diagonalizes the last term of the second line in eq .",
    "( [ eq : transformek ] ) .",
    "the transformed fermion operators will be denoted @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) , the hopping @xmath117 and finally @xmath118 for @xmath119 . in the context of the dmft",

    "the parameters of the single - site kondo model will be determined by the self - consistency condition of the dmft ( see below ) .",
    "a direct solution of model  ( [ eq : sskm-1 ] ) is , to our knowledge not possible .",
    "however , it can be further simplified : the hubbard term originating from the constraint  ( [ eq : constraint ] ) can be eliminated by simply reversing the `` fermionization '' procedure which led from hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) to ( [ eq : klm+u ] ) .",
    "the auxiliary fermion operators get replaced by a local spin-@xmath122 operator at the impurity site , and the constraint  ( [ eq : constraint ] ) can be dropped .",
    "this leads to the final version of the single - site kondo model : @xmath123 this last step , which could be called `` de - fermionization '' , distinguishes our approach from the one used in ref .",
    "@xcite and others .",
    "this `` de - fermionization '' ensures the exact fulfillment of the constraint  ( [ eq : constraint ] ) , which could for example only be kept on average ( @xmath124 instead of @xmath125 ) in  @xcite .    the parameters determining the conduction band in the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : sskm ] ) , namely @xmath120 and @xmath121 have to be specified according to the dmft self - consistency condition : the local conduction band green function ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : gf ] ) ) should be equivalent to the @xmath4-operator green function of the single - site model , @xmath126 : @xmath127 where the right equation follows from the formal solution of the equation of motion of @xmath128 .",
    "so instead of the usual definition for the hybridization function , @xmath129 , it has to be determined so that eq .",
    "( [ eq : seco ] ) holds .",
    "one will see below that the knowledge of @xmath130 , which can become spin - dependent through this procedure , is sufficient to solve the single - site kondo model  ( [ eq : sskm ] ) .",

    "the dmft , i.e.  the mapping of the klm onto the single - site model is , except for the limit of infinite spatial dimensions , an approximation , equivalent to the local approximation . in the exactly solvable case of the ferromagnetic semiconductor ( cf .",
    "[ sec : magpol ] ) this is equivalent to neglecting the magnon energies which are assumed to be at least one order of magnitude smaller than the energy scales under consideration here , e.g.  bandwidth or @xmath2 .",
    "next , we will introduce an approximative method to solve the single - site kondo model defined by hamiltonian  ( [ eq : sskm ] ) for an arbitrary hybridization function @xmath130 .      in the following section , we derive an equation of motion - based method to solve the single - site kondo model  ( [ eq : sskm ] ) .",
    "since in this section we deal only with this model , we suppress all subscripts distinguishing between quantities in the lattice and the single - site model .",
    "starting point is the equation of motion for the @xmath4-green function : @xmath131 where the higher green functions @xmath132 and @xmath133 , corresponding to the green functions @xmath134 and @xmath135 for the lattice case , are introduced .",
    "the `` mixed '' green function @xmath136 can be eliminated by investigating its equation of motion : @xmath137 thereby defining the hybridization function @xmath138 .",

    "this term prohibits an exact solution .",
    "in fact , the `` hybridization '' via @xmath121 is nothing else than the inter - site hopping which was neglected in the zero - bandwidth limit .",
    "this term will force us to make certain approximations in the determination of the higher green functions on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eomgd ] ) .",
    "we will exemplify this using the @xmath141-function .",
    "its equation of motion reads @xmath142 where on the one hand , higher `` impurity - site '' green functions are introduced , but on the other hand also a higher `` mixed '' green function , @xmath143 . in analogy to the one - particle mixed green function , eq .",

    "although only one approximation enters our decoupling procedure ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : hybridapprox ] ) ) , it still has to be seen as an uncontrollable approximation meaning that there is no true small parameter .",

    "( [ eq : hybridapprox ] ) reduces to  ( [ eq : mixedgd ] ) .",
    "however since we are interested in the general case with finite @xmath152 and bandwidth , we have to confirm the trustworthiness of this approximation by a comparison with other well - tested methods .",
    "we are now going to introduce three further approximation methods for the klm .",
    "these are known from literature , their strengths and weaknesses have been identified .",
    "the three methods differ substantially with respect to the theoretical assumptions made for an approximate solution of the klm .",

    "there is an upper bound for @xmath164  @xcite .",
    "we therefore had to limit @xmath164 to @xmath174 for some of the cpa calculations . within the dmft calculations , we experienced severe numerical problems which forced us to introduce a further approximation : `` mean - field''-decoupling the @xmath175 and @xmath176 functions simplifies the system of equations of motion : @xmath177 all dmft - results presented below were obtained using the hybridization approximation in combination with this unrestricted - mean - field decoupling of @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "as function of energy .",
    "the temperature is set to @xmath178 , therefore @xmath179 ( cpa : @xmath180 , see text ) and the electron density @xmath181 , the chemical potential is at @xmath182 ; solid line : spin-@xmath20 , dotted line spin-@xmath19 dos , scaledwidth=70.0% ]    in all calculations , the conduction band is described by a tight - binding dos for a simple - cubic lattice structure  @xcite of unit width ( @xmath183 ) .",
    "the curie temperature is taken as @xmath184 .",
    "the quasiparticle densities of states ( dos ) for quarter - filling and different values of @xmath2 are plotted in figs .",

    ".    we will begin the discussion with the dmft results shown in the left column of fig .",
    "[ fig : sf_t0 ] .",
    "a small value of @xmath2 leads to a spin - dependent shift of the spin-@xmath20 and @xmath19 dos , as one would obtain by a simple mean - field decoupling , i.e.  by replacing @xmath186 by its mean value @xmath164 in hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) . with increasing @xmath2 ,",
    "the dos show some striking correlation effects : first a broadening , later the onset of a splitting of the band can be observed .",
    "whereas in general , the correlation effects are stronger for spin @xmath19 ( indicated by a stronger quasiparticle damping ) , the splitting is , in contrast to the other two methods , more pronounced in the spin-@xmath20 dos .",
    "however , here the split - of ( upper ) peak has much less spectral weight than the original peak which , except for a band - narrowing still resembles strongly the free conduction band dos .",
    "the picture is very similar in the mcda . again , a mean - field like spin - dependent bandshift is observed for small @xmath2 . on increasing @xmath2 , the spin-@xmath19 dos broadens , and",
    "a two - peak structure emerges .",
    "the spin-@xmath20 dos remains , except for a small tail at its upper edge , unchanged .",
    "this behavior can easily be understood by comparing with the special case of the ferromagnetically saturated semiconductor as discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : magpol ] since the mcda develops continously into this special case for @xmath187 and @xmath188 .",
    "the spin-@xmath19 dos splits into a scattering part ( low energies ) and the polaron - like part at higher energies above the conduction band . unlike the @xmath189 case ,",
    "however , there are some , but weak modification in the @xmath20 dos , namely the above mentioned tail at its upper edge .",
    "this can be interpreted as a scattering contribution for spin-@xmath20 electrons .",
    "the origin of this is the finite number of spin-@xmath19 electrons .    , but for @xmath185 , therefore @xmath190.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    also the cpa dos show a remarkably similar picture as the previously discussed theories .",
    "again , there is the mean - field shift for small @xmath2 . for larger values of @xmath2 , the splitting of the spin-@xmath19 dos sets in similarly to the other two methods . here , this can be contributed to the two single - occupancy quasiparticle energies @xmath56 and @xmath57 known from the zero - bandwidth limit ( cf .  sec .",
    "[ sec : atomic ] ) . for @xmath191",
    "a third quasiparticle energy carries non - vanishing weight , namely the @xmath55 peak .",
    "this is located between the two other peaks since we switched off the conduction band coulomb interaction @xmath69 ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) ) . for @xmath192 , the appearance of this third peak in between the two main peaks is vaguely visible .",
    "a remarkable difference to the dmft and mcda results is the fact , that the spin-@xmath20 and scattering part of the spin-@xmath19 dos do not cover the same energy range .",
    "this shortcoming of the cpa is due to the neglection of spin - dynamics ( magnons ) as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : self - consistent - cpa ] ( cf.ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the sopt results are , for the plotted values of @xmath2 in the weak- and intermediate coupling regime , not too far away from the other results . for small @xmath2 , where the sopt becomes by definition reliable , the mean - field shift as in the other methods is clearly observable .",
    "similar to the other methods , the deformation of the spin-@xmath19 dos is much stronger than that of the spin-@xmath20 dos .",
    "however , for larger @xmath2 , the sopt never shows a true band splitting , its range of validity is certainly restricted .    for @xmath185 ,",
    "where spin - symmetry is re - established , the dmft , mcda and cpa give a similar overall picture .",
    "the resulting dos shows , already for @xmath193 , a two - peak structure ( dmft and mcda ) , in the cpa a third peak is dimly noticeable .",
    "the most remarkable observation is the near - coincidence of the dmft and mcda results for all @xmath2 values .",
    "the transition from the ( clearly distinct ) @xmath178 dos to the ( resembling ) @xmath185 dos is continuous for both theories .",
    "the sopt , however , has to be seen as a complete failure for a paramagnetic system already for relatively small @xmath194 .",
    "this can already be read of the formula for calculating the self - energy , which is more or less trivial .",
    "the corresponding results can not be connected to any of the exactly solvable limiting cases ( cf .",
    "[ sec : sopt ] ) .",
    "a sound - standing interpretation of the observations is not difficult since the mcda can be traced back to the exactly solved limiting case of the ferromagnetically saturated semiconductor ( cf.sec .",
    "[ sec : magpol ] ) and the cpa to that of the zero - bandwidth limit discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : atomic ] .",
    "the sopt , of course , becomes reliable for small @xmath2 .",
    "although all four presented methods are of approximate nature and their results do , at least for intermediate - to - large values of @xmath2 , differ , some common properties emerge : for small @xmath2 , the behavior is genuine mean - field like , a bandshift proportional to @xmath195 is observed . for larger @xmath2 ,",
    "the onset of a band splitting occurs . at @xmath178",
    "this primarily affects the spin-@xmath19 dos .",
    "this fact is understandable by examination of the ferromagnetically saturated semiconductor where the band splitting was discussed in terms of a scattering band and the magnetic polaron . in that case",
    "the spin-@xmath20 dos remains , except for a simple shift , unaffected by the interaction simply because spin - flip of spin-@xmath20 electrons is suppressed in this case .",
    "now for finite @xmath196 , this is only approximately true .",
    "the spin-@xmath19 dos still shows strong correlation effects , but also the spin-@xmath20 dos is affected due to the finite number of spin-@xmath19 electrons in the system .",
    "this manifests itself differently in the various methods : in the mcda , a tail is seen at the upper edge of the spin-@xmath20 dos , in the cpa , a shoulder develops , and in the dmft approach , a band splitting is observable . from this",
    "we conclude that correlation effects are much more pronounced in the dmft than in the other two theories . at @xmath185 , the dip indicating the onset of the band splitting is still existing for all but the sopt method . in cpa , mcda and",
    "the dmft results this splitting is of similar size , which can easily be read off the cpa where it is simply given by the difference of the respective energies from the zero - bandwidth limit ( see eq .  ( [ eq : atomic_energies ] ) ) .",
    "the two most pronounced peaks correspond to the single - occupancy quasiparticle energies @xmath56 and @xmath57 , the band splitting is therefore approximately @xmath197 .",
    "this is in contrast to the results obtained by dynamical mean - field theory for the @xmath16 klm ( klm with classical spins ) .",
    "the emerging picture for classical spins is the following  @xcite : at @xmath178 , the dos is characterized by a mean - field like `` zeeman '' splitting between the bands of both spin directions . with increasing temperature , at each of the respective spin-@xmath20 or @xmath19 band , spectral weight of the opposite spin direction appears , until finally at @xmath185 , the system becomes paramagnetic .",
    "the splitting into two subbands separated by @xmath198 stays constant .",
    "comparing our results with the @xmath16 ones , phenomenologically the dos s show completely different characteristics at @xmath178 , especially in the spin-@xmath19 band . for @xmath185 , the dos",
    "s look quite similar .",
    "however , the physics behind the scenes turn out to be completely different as can be seen , e.g. , by the inconsistent size of the band splitting @xmath199 .",
    "whereas in the classical - spin limit , the splitting is always due to a mean - field like `` on - site zeeman splitting '' , in the case of quantum spins , the various elementary excitations as discussed in the case of the ferromagnetically saturated semiconductor , are responsible for the sub - band structure . for the ferromagnetically saturated system ,",
    "the neglection of spin - flip processes and magnons in the @xmath16 calculation lead to the picture of a half - metal  @xcite .",
    "this does not apply for any finite value of @xmath152 and is therefore clearly an artifact of the @xmath16 limit .",
    "let us shortly remark on the situation with anti - ferromagnetic coupling ( @xmath0 )  @xcite .",
    "all four approximation methods presented here do not show any signs of kondo screening .",
    "an investigation of the special low - temperature physics of the model with @xmath0 is therefore not possible .",
    "however , some remarks about the behavior of the model for @xmath200 can be made : in general the excitation spectra are broader than in the @xmath1 case .",
    "the resulting exchange splitting of @xmath201 is also larger than for @xmath1 which can already be seen in the zero - bandwidth limit .",
    "this is again in sharp contrast to the @xmath202 results , where the size of the splitting is independent of the sign of @xmath2 .",
    "in this paper , we investigated the kondo lattice model ( klm ) focusing on the model with positive ( ferromagnetic ) exchange constant @xmath2 .",
    "we discussed two exactly solvable , but nevertheless non - trivial limiting cases as well as four different approximation methods .",
    "the results obtained by these methods , maybe except for the perturbation theory , compare generally reasonably well .",
    "sometimes even nearly perfect matches occur ( cf .  fig .",
    "[ fig : sf_tc ] ) . in general , the differences between the methods are smaller for the paramagnetic than the ferromagnetic system .    from the comparison of common features of these approximation methods in combination with the exact results , the following picture emerges for the quasiparticle structure of the ferromagnetic kondo lattice model : for small @xmath74 , a mean - field like shift of @xmath20 and @xmath19 dos is visible .",
    "already for intermediate coupling strengths , a band splitting of size @xmath203 occurs .",
    "the relevant energy scale for the splitting is @xmath204 . in the case of ferromagnetic saturation ( @xmath178 ) , the splitting is more pronounced in the @xmath19 than in the @xmath20 dos .",
    "this band - splitting should not be confused with the splitting found in the limit of `` classical spins '' ( @xmath16 ) . there , the splitting is simply due to a mean - field like zeeman - splitting and therefore of the size @xmath198 .",
    "contrary to that , our results clearly show that the two emerging subbands can be traced back to the two elementary excitations known from the limit of the ferromagnetically saturated semiconductor ( see above ) .",
    "the magnetic saturation of the spin - system suppresses these processes for spin-@xmath20 electrons which explains the stronger footprint of the correlations in the spin-@xmath19 dos . for finite temperatures ,",
    "the magnetic polaron generally remains a well defined quasiparticle , represented by a rather sharp lorentzian peak in the spectral density .",
    "now the spin-@xmath20 electrons can also participate in spin - exchange processes since the localized spins are not fully aligned any more .",
    "the spin - symmetric dos at @xmath205 also show the characteristic splitting .",
    "our results also confirm the fundamental differences between the @xmath1 and the @xmath0 case of the kondo lattice model : it can be read of both exactly solvable limiting cases that the ground state will be different depending on the sign of @xmath2 .",
    "the approximative approaches of secs .",
    "[ sec : dmft ] and  [ sec : approx ] do not allow a deeper investigation of the model with @xmath0 due to the inability to reproduce the special low - temperature properties of that model ( `` kondo physics '' ) .",
    "another important conclusion from our calculations can be drawn : there is always finite spin-@xmath19 spectral weight in the region of the spin-@xmath20 dos .",
    "this spectral weight does not disappear in the limit @xmath206 but only in the limit @xmath16 ( `` classical spins '' ) .",
    "for the ferromagnetic klm ( @xmath1 ) , this implies that the klm for @xmath9 and large @xmath2 , corresponding to the situation found in manganites , will not be a half - metal for @xmath178 , contrary to the predictions of @xmath16 calculations .    financial support by the _ volkswagen - foundation _ within the project _",
