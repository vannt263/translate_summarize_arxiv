    "starting with the pioneering studies of kron ( 1980 ) and tyson ( 1988 ) , one of the main targets of deep imaging surveys has been the observation and study of galaxies at high redshift .",
    "the combination of deep imaging and systematic spectroscopic follow  up has led to the discovery that the bulk of galaxies at the spectroscopic limit is made of blue star  forming galaxies at @xmath27 , where most of the stars of the present  day universe appear to form ( see koo and kron 1992 , ellis 1998 for extensive reviews ) .    a new approach recently developed to access the earlier epochs of galaxy formation relies on deep multicolor surveys , where multiband images are taken with a complete set of standard broad  band filters in order to cover the overall spectrum of the galaxy and to discriminate the populations at different redshifts .",
    "in this case , the multiband catalogs are used to define sharp color criteria that select high redshift galaxy candidates ( steidel et al 1995 , madau et al 1996 , madau et al 1998 , m98 hereafter , fontana et al .",
    "1996 , giallongo et al 1998 , g98 hereafter ) .",
    "the very successful results of the spectroscopic follow  up of color selected samples ( steidel et al 1996 , steidel et al 1999 ) witness the reliability of the method .",
    "however , this technique does nt exploit all the information contained in multiband catalogs , that allow to sample the spectral shape of each galaxy over a very extended wavelength range . with this aim",
    ", the `` photometric redshift '' approach is rapidly becoming common practice .",
    "the concept that the redshift of a galaxy is reflected in its broad  band colors dates back to the early 60 s ( baum 1962 ) , and the existence of a definite relation between @xmath22 and magnitude has been demonstrated by koo ( 1985 ) .",
    "however , extensive applications of this method have been developed only recently in order to analyze new sets of deep multicolor images .",
    "following the original approach of koo , methods have been applied to the hdf - n that make use of the observed redshift ",
    "magnitude relation ( connolly et al 1997 , wang et al 1998 ) derived from the spectroscopic subsample of the hdf ",
    "n . a different class of methods must be used when no large spectroscopic follow  up has been obtained yet , or when the technique is to be extended beyond the redshift range covered by the spectroscopic sample . in these cases ,",
    "a spectral library is used to compute galaxy colors at any redshift , and a matching technique is used to obtain the best  fitting redshift . with different implementations ,",
    "this method has been used on hdf ",
    "n ( sawicky 1997 , fernandez ",
    "soto et al 1999 , benitez et al 1999 , arnouts et al 1999a ) and ground  based data ( g98 , fontana et al 1999a , pello et al 1999 ) .    of paramount importance for the development of these applications",
    "have been the public surveys carried out over the last few years , primarily the hdf ",
    "n ( williams et al 1996 ) and hdf  s ( casertano et al 2000 ) , since the superb photometric quality of the data and the extensive follow  up observations enable a large number of scientific issues to be addressed . large ground  based telescopes have also been used to provide multicolor data with an extended wavelength coverage , often to support deep observations from space facilities .",
    "examples are the vlt observations of the hdfs  nicmos field ( fontana et al 1999a ) and the ntt observations of the whole hdf  s ( da costa et al 1998 ) and of the axaf deep field ( rengelink 1998 ) . in this context , the field of the @xmath28 quasar br1202 - 07 was one of the first where deep multicolor observations have been collected from ground to obtain catalogs suitable for determining photometric redshifts .",
    "first observations in the bvri bands were used to search for galaxies at @xmath29 in the qso surroundings , and led to the identification of a star  forming companion to the qso ( fontana et al 1996 , see also hu et al 1996 , petitjean et al 1996 , fontana et al 1998 ) , providing the first successful example of the `` drop - out '' technique at @xmath29 . from the same set of data ,",
    "a photometric redhift distribution was obtained and discussed in g98 .",
    "a much deeper field in the same bvri bands was obtained in 1997 with the susi1 imager at the ntt , and named `` ntt deep field '' ( arnout et al 1999b ) .",
    "wider images covering both fields have been obtained in j and k@xmath0 during the commissioning phase of the sofi infrared spectro ",
    "imager at the ntt ( saracco et al .",
    "1999 ) , and also made publicly available .    in this paper",
    ", we present new u band observations of the br1202 and ntt deep fields and describe the procedures used to produce the final ubvrijk@xmath0 catalog in both fields ( sect .",
    "the photometric redshift technique is described in sect . 3 and applied to the ntt catalogs and to the public catalogs of the hdf ",
    "n and hdf  s .",
    "the main properties of the resulting photometric redshift catalogs are described in sect.4 . in sect . 5",
    ", we focus on the selection of high redshift galaxies to discuss the differences of this approach with respect to the lyman lymit selection and the possible contamination by foreground m stars .",
    "the photometric redshift catalogs presented here have been used to address several scientific issues in the high redshift universe , ranging from the evolution of the luminosity density and the number of massive galaxies already assembled at early epochs ( fontana et al 1999b ) to the evolution of galaxy sizes ( poli et al 1999 , giallongo et al 2000 ) .",
    "the data and photometric redshift catalogs are also available on line at the web site http://www.mporzio.astro.it/highz .",
    "the new data used in this paper are deep ubvrijk@xmath0 images taken with the eso ",
    "ntt telescope on the field of the high redshift quasar br1202 - 07 ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the b , v , gunn @xmath30 and i observations were taken with the ntt susi imager during two separate observing runs , on 2326 apr 1995 and during the spring of 1997 respectively .",
    "the pointings were chosen in order to obtain two slightly overlapping fields , with the first field ( hereafter named br1202 ) centered on the quasar and the second ( ntt deep field , nttdf hereafter ) 100 arcsec south of it , resulting in a total field of 2.3@xmath314. since observations were obtained with two slightly different instrumental setups , the two fields have been analyzed independently and the objects in the overlapping region have been used as a final test of the photometric catalog .",
    "the bvri observations and data reduction of the br1202 field are discussed in fontana et al 1996 and g98 .",
    "the nttdf was observed in service mode by the ntt team in february through april 1997 , and the data obtained are publicly available at http://www.hq.eso.org/science/ndf .",
    "details of the observations , the data reduction and the photometric catalog are discussed in arnouts et al 1999b .",
    "image quality in both fields is quite good , with sub ",
    "arcsec seeing in all the final images .",
    "an image of the final field in the @xmath30 band is shown in fig  [ image ] .    the j and k@xmath0 observations were obtained with the sofi spectro ",
    "imager at the eso ",
    "ntt ( moorwood et al 1998a ) in march 1998 .",
    "the field of view of this instrument is considerably larger ( 5@xmath315 ) than the susi one so both fields could be observed simultaneously .",
    "the data reduction and calibration of the images are described in saracco et al 1999 and publicly available at the eso website .",
    "we have extracted from the full format j and k@xmath0 frames two sub  images corresponding to the two susi fields described above , by locating a number of corresponding bright sources and applying a linear resampling to the images . since this operation added a further rebin to the original pixels , altering the noise statistics , we estimated the final limiting magnitude of the ir images by computing the @xmath32clipped standard deviation of the intensity of the sky  background as measured in random positions of the rebinned image with a 1@xmath33 aperture ( we have verified that the same procedure on the original image provides the same standard deviation ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath34 limiting johnson magnitudes are @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "these data have been complemented with deep u images obtained with the new susi2 imager at eso  ntt .",
    "this instrument is equipped with a mosaic of two @xmath37 ccd chips with a field of view of @xmath38 that matches the sofi one .",
    "observations were done with the same pointing as the sofi observations , with the two former susi fields both falling on the same chip .",
    "data were obtained during two clear nights on 21 and 24 april 1998 .",
    "a total of 25200 second of integration time were obtained , split into individual exposures of 1200 - 1500 s each .",
    "observations were done in dark sky under moderate seeing conditions ( about 1.4@xmath33 on average ) .",
    "the instrument performance was somewhat reduced with respect to the nominal one because of residual parasitic light entering the detector , that produced an additional background pattern with an intensity of about 40% of the sky background in the u band .",
    "several exposures of this scattered light were taken during a bad weather night ( 25 april 1998 ) . the pattern proved to be constant and",
    "could therefore be subtracted from the individual raw images before further processing . aside from this aspect , the data reduction followed the usual steps for deep images acquired in dither mode .",
    "it has been performed with the automated dither pipeline developed for the susi2 images at the rome observatory .",
    "it makes use of standard midas commands and of sextractor ( bertin and arnouts 1998 ) to flat - field , align and coadd the images to produce a final image together with its absolute variance map ( i.e. the variance in adu of each pixel in the frame ) .",
    "a set of spectrophotometric standard stars have been observed at several airmasses during both nights to calibrate the u images in the ab system .",
    "we estimate that the final accuracy of this procedure is of the order of 0.1 _ mags_. again , two smaller images rebinned and aligned to the bv@xmath30i frames were extracted , and their zeropoints were computed in order to match the u magnitude of the brightest objects .    for the reader s convenience ,",
    "we summarize in table1 the main characteristics of these observations and compare them with those of the hdf ",
    "n and hdf  s , which cover similar areas and will also be used in the following sections .",
    "object detection and flux measurement have been performed with the sextractor software . in the nttdf",
    "we have repeated the procedure used in arnouts et al 1999b by using the sum of the bv@xmath30i frames , that have comparable seeing .",
    "the numbering , position and bvri magnitudes of the nttdf provided here are therefore identical to those published in arnouts et al 1999b . in the case of the br1202 field",
    "we have used the @xmath30 image , that has the best seeing , to detect and deblend the objects , partly for consistency with g98 and partly because the addition of the bvi images - that have either worse seeing or less depth - did not result in an improved object detection .",
    "since the aim of this work is to derive photometric redshifts of objects that are significantly above the detection threshold , the differences in the procedures adopted for object detection are not important , although they must be kept in mind when using the data . in particular , only the nttdf has been used in fontana et al 1999b to measure the evolution of the rest ",
    "frame uv luminosity density , using the i  selected sample .",
    "we have also performed an independent object detection on the k@xmath0 images alone to ensure that all the galaxies at @xmath39 were included in the catalogs .",
    "the only object detected in the ir images but not in the optical is the methane brown dwarfs already discussed in a separate paper ( cuby et al 1999 ) .",
    "we have first obtained a reference magnitude @xmath40 in the @xmath30 band for each object in both fields by obtaining both isophotal and aperture magnitudes in a 2x fwhm aperture .",
    "the isophotal magnitude was used for the brighter objects , i.e. for those objects where the isophotal radius is larger than the aperture one . for fainter objects ,",
    "an aperture correction to @xmath41 has been estimated on bright stars and applied to correct the 2x fwhm aperture magnitude .",
    "although this procedure is strictly valid for star - like objects only , it has been shown to be a good approximation for faint galaxies ( smail et al .",
    "1995 ) .    to obtain total magnitudes in the other bands we have first measured aperture magnitudes in a fixed circular area corresponding to 2x fwhm of the detection frame .",
    "total magnitudes in each band @xmath42 have then been computed as @xmath43 , i.e. the observed aperture colors with respect to the reference @xmath30 band have been normalized to the total @xmath30 magnitude @xmath40 as obtained above .",
    "this procedure in principle ensures that colors - that are the quantities used in estimating the redshifts - are measured in the same physical region at any wavelength . in ground ",
    "based images this procedure is complicated by the different seeing of the images in the various bands . to compensate for this ,",
    "we have degraded the @xmath30 reference frame to the seeing of each band and computed the aperture colors @xmath44 on the images with the same seeing .",
    "to give an idea of the importance of this effect , we have found roughly that each 0.1@xmath33 of difference in seeing translates to about a 0.1 _ mags _ difference in the aperture color , although the exact value depends obviously on the object morphology .",
    "the zeropoints were corrected for galactic absorption assuming @xmath45 ( burstein & heiles 1982 ) with @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "we summarize in table 1 the zeropoints of the photometric systems adopted for the catalogs , namely ab for all the hdf catalogs and for the @xmath51 band of the ntt fields , and johnson for all the other bands of the ntt fields .",
    "since we have not applied any color term to the johnson magnitudes of the catalogs , , the resulting magnitudes are calibrated in the `` natural '' system defined by our instrumental passbands ( see fontana et al 1996 ) .",
    "we have used the overlapping section of the two fields to compare the two photometric catalogs - that have been taken with slightly different instrumental setups and at different epochs .",
    "the differences found ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) are close to the limit of the quoted uncertainties on the zeropoints .",
    "since the br1202 field has been observed under more controlled photometric conditions , we have applied this set of small corrections to the nttdf catalog to make the two catalogs fully consistent .",
    "however , the differences may be indicative of the actual uncertainties associated with the photometry on deep exposures from ground  based telescopes , that typically result from the stacking of several exposures obtained on different nights .",
    "we will discuss in sect3.2 the possible effects of these uncertainties on the obtained .",
    "the final catalogs produced ( along with the photometric redshifts , see sect .",
    "3 ) are reported in table 2 and are available on line at http://www.mporzio.astro.it/highz .",
    "this table contains also the half ",
    "light radius measured with the morphological analysis described in poli et al 1999 .      to produce the final catalogs on which photometric redshifts are computed , we have identified and removed from the final galaxy sample obvious bright stars using the class_star parameter provided by sextractor . a threshold class_star@xmath56 has been set ( at @xmath57 in the nttdf and @xmath58 in the br1202 field ) , on the basis of the comparison between ground  based and hst data ( arnouts et al 1999b ) .",
    "we have also made use of the more detailed morphological analysis by poli et al ( 1999 ) to identify stars down to @xmath59 on the nttdf only .",
    "we have applied our photometric redshift code also to the hdf - n and hdf  s with the ir observations obtained at kitt peak ( dickinson 1998 ) and at ntt  sofi ( da costa et al , 1998 ) , respectively . for the hdf ",
    "n we have used the multicolor catalog published by fernandez ",
    "soto et al ( 1999 ) , which uses an optimal technique to match the optical and ir images that have a quite different seeing .",
    "a similar catalog for the hdf  s has been provided by the same authors and is available at the stony brook web site http://www.ess.sunysb.edu/astro/hfds/home.html .",
    "the stony brook catalog of the hdf ",
    "s contains also the ntt optical magnitudes ( ubvri ) for each object , obtained from the public data of the eis deep survey .",
    "very little difference on the photometric redshift is found when the ntt data are used or not , which is due to the lower statistical weight ( compared to wfpc data ) that is associated with them .",
    "for this reason , we have used only wfpc bands in the optical and ntt  sofi in the ir , for consistency with the hdf ",
    "n . in both cases",
    "we have clipped the outer regions of the frame with lower s / n .",
    "obvious stars have been excluded at @xmath60 in the hdf - s again on the basis of the sextractor class_star@xmath61 morphological classification .",
    "also the complete set of hdf photometric redshift catalogs is available at http://www.mporzio.astro.it/highz",
    "much emphasis has been recently placed on the choice of the spectral library used to compute galaxy colors as a function of redshift .",
    "several authors ( e.g. fernandez  soto et al 1999 , benitez 1999 ) use observed spectral templates ( e.g. coleman et al 1980 ) .",
    "this has the obvious advantage of only relying on a compact set of empirically determined data , but these must be extended in the uv and ir regions using synthetic models and augmented with bluer templates to represent the vast fraction of blue galaxies that dominate the counts at faint magnitudes .",
    "an even more empirical approach is to determine a set of autofunctions from the spectroscopic control sample ( csabai et al 2000 ) , from which a set of template spectra can be derived .",
    "our recipe for photometric redshifts is based on the use of spectral synthesis models , at present the gissel library by bruzual & charlot . at the cost of an additional computational effort ,",
    "these models allow - at least in principle - to take into account the spectral evolution of galaxies at high redshift",
    ". we will show below that these models are able to provide a redshift accuracy which is at least equivalent to more empirical choices .",
    "however , the main reason for following this approach is the gain in physical information on the properties of high redshift galaxies that can be obtained by comparing their observed spectral energy distributions with the model predictions . from the input parameters used to draw the best fitting solution for each galaxy we can indeed obtain estimates of the main physical quantities of each galaxy in the sample : age of the last major starburst , mass already assembled in stars and dust content . even taking into account the known degeneracies among some of the input parameters ,",
    "one may use this information in a statistical way to further constrain galaxy evolution .",
    "applications of this technique have already been presented in g98 and we refer to forthcoming papers for further applications of this method .    in practice , we have used a miller - scalo initial mass function ( imf ) including stars in the @xmath62 m@xmath63 range ( the effect of different choices of the imf has been shown in g98 ) .",
    "we have considered the cases of metallicity @xmath64 , @xmath65 and as low as @xmath66 with a weak correlation between age and metallicity .",
    "for these models , we span over a grid of @xmath67 star formation time - scales @xmath68 ( from @xmath69 gyrs to constant ) and ages to produce the evolution of different spectral types ( the complete grid adopted is listed in g98 ) . since we are aware that the smoothly declining star ",
    "formation histories that we have used are a simplified rendition of the actual histories experienced by real galaxies , we have added a few models with additional bursts of star formation . in practice",
    ", we have overimposed short - lived burst ( 0.3 gyr of timescale ) to two evolving models ( 0.3 and 5 gyr of timescale ) , starting at an age of 3 gyr . in each model",
    ", we let a substantial fraction of the final mass in the galaxy to be assembled during the burst : 10% , 30% or 50% in the former and 10% , 20% or 30% in the latter ( for higher fractions the light from the starburst would dominate that from the underlying galaxy at any wavelength ) . _",
    "a posteriori _ , we have verified that `` multiple burst '' models account for about 16% of the best  fitting models . in 30% of them , removing the multiple bursts from the library changes the best fit by more than @xmath70 , and in 14 % of the cases by more than @xmath71 , but always less than @xmath72 . in all these cases",
    "the burst models are selected to match the contemporary presence of a flat star ",
    "forming uv continuum and a large 4000break with a significant slope of the ir continuum , that is difficult to match with the simple exponential laws ( see also the discussion on the scalo @xmath73 parameter in g98 ) .",
    "although the spectroscopic sample is too small to provide a meaningful statistics , we note that a marginal improvement of the photometric redshift accuracy is usually obtained with the `` multiple burst '' models .",
    "more important is the effect that these models have on the parameters estimated for the best fitting spectrum .",
    "for instance , the stellar mass in each galaxy is found lower by typically 20% ( but up to 60% ) at fixed redhift , because of the contribution of post  agb stars ( that have a low m / l ) to the near  ir flux .",
    "we have also added to all spectral synthesis model the reddening produced by internal dust ( smc , pei 1992 and calzetti , 1997 ) and lyman series absorption produced by the intergalactic medium ( madau 1995 ) . as a further improvement with respect to g98 , we have added [ oii ] and h@xmath74 emission lines by inverting the kennicutt 1994 relations for the relevant imf .",
    "the emission is less straightforward to implement , since the spectral properties at the frequency observed in spectroscopic samples range from strong emission lines to damped absorption systems . as a tradeoff , we have removed from the unattenuated spectrum the stellar absorption features at the frequency .    at any redshift",
    ", galaxies are allowed to have any age smaller than the hubble time at that redshift ( @xmath75 and @xmath76 km s@xmath77mpc@xmath77 have been adopted throughout the paper ) . the choice of the cosmological parameters are not important , since only colors are effectively used in deriving the photometric redshifts .    from the large dataset ( @xmath78 ) of `` simulated galaxies '' thus produced we",
    "compute the expected fluxes @xmath79 in any filter @xmath42 by convolving the theoretical spectrum with the normalized transmission curve of the telescope+detector+filter system ( see pickles 1998 for the formulae adopted ) .",
    "finally , a @xmath80minimization procedure has been applied to find the best ",
    "fitting spectral template to the observed fluxes . for each template @xmath81 at any redshift @xmath22 we first minimize @xmath82 ^ 2\\ ] ] with respect to the scaling factor @xmath0 where @xmath83 is the flux observed in a given filter @xmath42 , @xmath84 is its uncertainty and the sum is over the filters used , and then we identify the best ",
    "fitting solution with the lowest @xmath85 .",
    "the scaling factor @xmath0 is applied to the input parameters of the input spectrum to compute all the rest ",
    "frame quantities , such as absolute magnitudes or stellar masses .",
    "the stony brook catalogs of the hdf  n and hdf  s provide @xmath83 and @xmath86 already in physical units ( jy ) , and are therefore directly usable in eq .",
    "1 . in the two ntt fields , where catalogs are given in standard magnitudes @xmath87 ( zeropointed to the johnson system ) , @xmath83",
    "is given by @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the conversion factor from the ab to the johnson systems , found by convolving an a0v stellar spectrum of the pickels 1998 library with the telescope+detector+filter efficiency .",
    "as is well known , the conversion between fluxes and magnitude is not well behaved as the noise level is approached , which raises the question of how non - detections are handled in eq .",
    "1 . in the cases of the two hdfs ,",
    "the stony brook catalogs provides very small or even negative fluxes for objects that are non detected ( like `` u  dropout '' or faint galaxies with no ir detection ) , so that eq .",
    "1 can be directly applied . in the ntt fields ,",
    "we have followed the common practice of defining a magnitude limit at a given @xmath32 level , and computed @xmath85 according to the following recipe : _ a ) _ we have discarded from the sum in eq.1 the bandpasses where _ both _ the observed galaxy flux and the models fall below the limiting magnitude ; _ b ) _ we have included in the sum the bandpasses where the models lay above the limit : to weight properly the non  detection , the object has assigned zero flux and noise equal to the @xmath90 magnitude limit .    the former approach is closer to the physical definition of `` measure '' and statistically cleaner , but relies on an accurate estimate of the noise level at very low fluxes , which in real images may be dominated by non - poissonian effects ( such as residuals of flat  fielding , pixel correlation and accuracy of sky  subtraction ) that may be difficult to quantify .",
    "the latter may be useful either on public data with conventional formats or when conservative upper limits on fluxes are more appropriate to the data available .",
    "it is therefore interesting to investigate the effects of the different criteria on the final photometric redshifts . to this purpose ,",
    "we have converted the stony brook hdf ",
    "n catalog into magnitudes , and defined the @xmath91 limits in the various bands by locating the magnitude at which @xmath92 .",
    "we compare the photometric redshifts obtained in the original `` flux '' format and in the conventional `` magnitude '' one in fig  [ uplim ] , differentiating galaxies in the three samples used in fontana et al 1999b : @xmath93 it is seen that very modest differences arise only in the faintest sample , with a few galaxies migrating from @xmath94 to @xmath95 and even less in the opposite way ( which makes the choice of the `` flux '' format more conservative ) , and with some scatter in the @xmath96 region , where the different treatment of the ir band plays a role .",
    "this procedure has been tested on a sample of 125 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts and multicolor photometry .",
    "of these , 112 come from the cohen et al ( 2000 ) compilation of the hdf ",
    "n ( we have included only objects that fall in the inner region of the frame , as for the whole optical catalog , see sect .",
    "2.3 ) , 3 are taken from the stony brook public catalogs of the hdf  s , while the remaining 10 are taken from the vlt spectroscopic follow  up of `` dropout '' galaxies in the hdf  s and axaf deep fields ( cristiani et al 2000 ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ zspe ] , where we differentiate between objects with secure or uncertain redshift , following the classification by cohen et al ( 2000 ) .",
    "if we consider only the objects with secure redshift , and remove the object at @xmath97 with @xmath98 , for a total 101 objects , the accuracy is @xmath99 at @xmath100 and @xmath101 at @xmath102 , that we keep as reference value . if we take all the galaxies in the sample , and remove only the three objects with clearly discrepant redshift , the accuracy raise to @xmath103 at @xmath100 and @xmath104 at @xmath102 .",
    "if we compute a 3-sigma clipped rms we obtain an accuracy @xmath105 over the whole redshift range , with 111 objects out of 125 ( i.e. 89% ) , and @xmath106 in the @xmath100 interval ( 85 objects out of 91 , i.e. 93% ) . in any case , the relative precision @xmath107 $ ] is always of the order of 0.05 in the @xmath108 sample , as in most of similar analysis ( cohen et al 2000 ) .    a 5% systematic underestimate @xmath109 appears to exist at @xmath102 in the spectroscopic sample , similar to that found by a recent revised version of the photometric redshifts based on the coleman spectra ( @xmath110 , lanzetta 2000 ) , but with opposite sign .",
    "we will explore in future works how this underestimate can be reduced with a different choice of the gissel grid .",
    "in particular , we are collecting a much wider spectroscopic sample in different fields ( dodorico et al , in preparation , and within the `` k20 project '' , p.i .",
    "cimatti ) and with a variety of bandwidths to perform a more accurate calibration of the spectral library , especially in the range @xmath111 , where most of the observed data come from the rest ",
    "frame uv spectra .    undoubtedly , the availability of only one major spectroscopic control sample ( the hdf - n ) is a major limitation that prevents to some extent a full evaluation of all the systematics involved in .",
    "it is worth reminding that at least 4 different ingredients are needed to pin down an accurate recipe for photometric redshifts : i ) the photometric catalog ( which depends on the accuracy of data processing and calibration and on the procedure used to measure colors ) ; ii ) the knowledge of the response curve of the telescope+filters+detector system ; iii ) the spectral library used and iv ) the matching algorithm used . despite this ,",
    "most of the current debate is focused on the best choice of the spectral library and the relative influence of the different components in a typical survey is far from being assessed , especially in the case of ground  based observations .",
    "some hints on the expected biases may be obtained by monte carlo simulations .",
    "however , these typically assume errors to be gaussian distributed which may be an oversimplification since , at the very bright and very faint limits , the uncertainties involved in background estimation and flat  fielding may dominate the errors . in fernandez ",

    "arnouts et al 1999a showed that the maximum number of misidentifications ( i.e. shift in @xmath22 exceeding @xmath113 ) is below 30% in the @xmath112 catalogs .",
    "we adopt here a brighter limit @xmath114 ( much brighter than the @xmath115 limiting magnitude ) , that is ultimately set by the depth of the bluest images ( @xmath116 ) , so that a minimum @xmath117 is still measurable . at this magnitude",
    "the misidentification are obviously much lower ( see fig 4 of arnouts et al 1999a ) . by analogy",

    "[ zp ] , lower panel ) shows that the systematic changes to the zeropoints induce systematic offsets in the that vary with redshift as the spectral breaks pass across the various filters .",
    "these changes marginally affect the selection of high redshift galaxies in the nttdf : two objects at @xmath123 in the final catalog are assigned at @xmath124 with the original calibration ( out of 40 in the @xmath125 bin ) , compensated by two objects that are moved from @xmath126 to much lower @xmath22 .",
    "one galaxy ( out of 14 ) is added to the @xmath127 bin with the adopted calibration .",
    "the major statistical effect is due to 5 objects that move from @xmath128 to @xmath129 , slightly changing the predicted values in the uv luminosity density in the bins adopted in fontana et al 1999b .    in the long run",
    ", we expect that extended spectroscopic follow - up of multicolor deep fields with different filter sets and in different regions of the sky will allow a detailed evaluation of the different systematics involved .",
    "we discuss in this section the fundamental properties of the redshift distributions in the catalogs . beyond being the basis for several scientific studies - as discussed in the introduction - these distributions",
    "can be used to compare the predictions of photometric redshift analyses in different fields and with different instrumental setups . given the limited size of the fields ( the hdfs and the nttdf have areas of 4 - 4.8 arcmin@xmath130 , respectively ) small scale fluctuations are expected to lead to discrepancies in the redshift distributions . at the same time",
    ", photometric redshifts may still be regarded as an experimental technique and small uncertainities in the photometric calibration or inadequacy of the spectral templates in the different filter sets may also lead to small but systematic effects in the resulting redshifts . at the present stage ,",
    "it is not posssible to fully disentangle these effects , pending full spectroscopic follow - ups and independent checks of the image calibrations .",
    "however , the comparison among the results in different fields may be regarded as an estimate of the total uncertainities in this kind of analysis . for an evaluation of its effects on some scientific topics",
    "see fontana et al 1999b .",
    "fig  [ nz_br1202 ] shows the redshift distribution in the catalogs of the two fields around , separately ( we remind the reader that these catalogs have different depths ) .",
    "the distribution of fig  [ nz_br1202]_b _ of the br1202 field is similar to the one published in giallongo et al 98 , where no u and j band and poorer k data were available .",
    "we find here the typical characteristics of redshift distributions at faint limits i.e most of the galaxies are located at @xmath131 with a tail extending to greater @xmath22 .",
    "although the comparison between the @xmath30selected distribution of the br1202 field and the i  selected distribution of the nttdf is not straightforward , we note that the tail of high redshift galaxies is - as expected - more pronounced in the deeper sample .",
    "we also note that the position of the peak in the redshift distribution that is skewed to lower redshifts in the nttdf compared to the br1202 field , opposite to what is naively expected in a deeper sample .",
    "this is , however , consistent with the observed number densities in the two fields - the nttdf being richer in relatively bright galaxies - and emphasizes the need for much wider surveys .",
    "the average redshift distributions at faint limits can be obtained by merging the nttdf and the two hdfs .",
    "fig  [ nz_i ]",
    ". shows the i - limited distributions , at @xmath132 ( for a total of 973 objects ) , resulting from the combination of nttdf and the two hdfs , and at @xmath133 ( 1361 objects ) , from the two hdfs alone .",
    "the global redshift distribution shows again the well known features of a distinct peak at intermediate redshifts , @xmath5 for the brighter and @xmath134 for the fainter followed by a tail extending to the highest redshifts compatible with the i selection criteria .",
    "a close scrutiny of the individual distributions reveals systematic differences amongst the fields . at both magnitude limits , the hdf ",
    "s has a much smaller number of galaxies at @xmath10 than the hdf ",
    "n . since the filter set",
    "used in both observations is identical , this effect is not likely to be an artefact of the photometric redshifts .    finally , we use the combined data sets of nttdf and hdfs to build the redshift distrbution in ir selected samples shown in fig  [ nz_ir ] .",
    "the basic scientific output of these distributions has been discussed in fontana et al 1999b , where it is shown that the redshift distribution of k  band selected galaxies provides a direct estimate of the number of massive galaxies already assembled at high redshift .",
    "we provide here a more detailed view of the redshift distribution in j and k  selected samples at different magnitude limits",
    ". these distributions may be useful for tuning extended spectroscopic surveys with the new ir spectrographs that are being implemented at 8m telescopes .",
    "these surveys are designed to improve the knowledge of the large scale structures and emission line features of galaxies in the range @xmath135 , where spectroscopic measurements with optical spectrographs are difficult because of the lack of suitable features .",
    "we detail the observed number densities at different j and ks limits in table  [ ircounts ] .",
    "we find that the number density of galaxies at @xmath136 is @xmath137arcmin@xmath16 at @xmath17 and @xmath138arcmin@xmath16 at @xmath13 , and drops to @xmath19arcmin@xmath16 ( at @xmath13 ) at @xmath20 .",
    "the search for extremely high redshift galaxies is one of the most interesting applications of deep multicolor imaging .",
    "the so  called `` dropout '' technique has gained widespread popularity due to its simplicity and high success rate in detecting galaxies at @xmath139 .",
    "however , it is worth remembering that this method relies on the contemporary presence of _ two _ distinct features : the sharp cutoff provided by the intrinsic lyman limit ( at @xmath140 ) or by the igm lyman@xmath74 absorption ( at higher @xmath22 ) _ and _ the flat star  forming continuum at longer wavelengths , that samples the rest  frame extreme uv spectral region .",
    "the latter criterium is necessary to discriminate against interlopers ( e.g. intermediate @xmath22 elliptical or dusty galaxies , or even late  type stars ) that may also show a dramatic drop in their rest  frame near uv . in a nutshell , high redshift galaxies appear as objects that are `` blue in the red and red in the blue ''",
    ". an important consequence of this approach is that the `` dropout '' technique is essentially a highly conservative technique that is designed to minimize the fraction of interlopers , but that is biased against even moderately dust  reddened galaxies : as shown in pettini et al 1997 , even a relatively weak dust absorption ( @xmath141 with an smc extinction law ) would prevent the detection of galaxies at @xmath142 in their well - studied @xmath143 color plane .    given the strength of the igm color feature , color selection criteria and photometric redshifts provide comparable results when the filter set ensures an appropriate coverage of both features .",
    "this is illustrated at @xmath144 in the vlt observations of the hdfs nicmos field ( fontana et al 1999a ) and at higher @xmath22 in the previous version of the br1202 catalog ( g98 ) , where a @xmath145 requirement was explicitly chosen to detect galaxies at @xmath146 .",
    "a similar requirement @xmath147 has been adopted by steidel et al 1999 to improve the rejection of low @xmath22 interlopers in their first systematic spectroscopic follow up of @xmath29 candidates .",
    "unfortunately , a similar agreement between photometric redshifts and color selection criteria does not hold in the case of galaxies at @xmath148 in the hdf ",
    "n and hdf  s . as a result ,",
    "the estimate of the uv luminosity density obtained with color selection criteria ( @xmath149  erg  s@xmath77  hz@xmath77  mpc@xmath150 , m98 ) is significantly different from that obtained with photometric redshifts ( ( @xmath151  erg  s@xmath77  hz@xmath77  mpc@xmath150 , pascarelle et al 1998 , fontana et al 1999b ) .",
    "this is primarily due to the much larger number of candidates selected by the latter technique ( roughly 2 times larger ) .",
    "this difference appears rather puzzling at first glance , because both methods have been applied to the same data set ( albeit on different catalogs ) and the m98 selection criterium has been defined using a synthesis spectral library similar to the one used here .",
    "to investigate the origin of this discrepancy , we reproduce in fig  [ madau ] the @xmath152 vs @xmath153 plane adopted by m98 , whose selection criteria requires galaxy candidates to fall within the polygonal region shown in fig  [ madau ] ( solid line ) , _ and _ to have @xmath154 .",
    "the latter requirement ensures a proper detection of the `` @xmath155dropout '' and is therefore ultimately set by the depth of the @xmath156 frame .",
    "we also plot in fig  [ madau ] the observed galaxy colors of the joined hdf ",
    "n + hdf  s catalogs , differentiating galaxies at different photometric redshifts . at variance with the m98 catalog ,",
    "our data are limited at @xmath157 , that corresponds to a rest  frame wavelength of @xmath158   .",
    "the following conclusions result from this comparison :    - most of the galaxies lying within the m98 polygonal region have a photometric redshift falling in the @xmath159 range .",
    "the few exception are in any case at @xmath160 , in agreement with the expected scatter of photometric redshifts .",
    "this confirms our statement that the strengths of the `` dropout '' signature is strong enough to provide a unique redshift assignment .",
    "conversely , about 50% ( i.e. 29 out of 54 ) of the galaxies with @xmath161 fall within the m98 area ( we include also the two objects at the left of the m98 area ) .",
    "- of the remaining fraction ( 25 out of 54 ) of the @xmath162 candidates , most are distributed in a `` belt '' around the m98 area , that is indeed occupied by high @xmath22 theoretical models ( see fig .",
    "5 of m98 ) but was excluded to minimize the contamination by lower redshift interlopers .    - finally , other objects lay progressively apart from the m98 region , filling the bridge toward the color position of galaxies at @xmath163 , with progressively larger @xmath153 and smaller @xmath152 with respect to what is required by the m98 approach .",
    "these `` @xmath164 outliers '' are typically faint in @xmath165 and have a very large @xmath166 .",
    "the brightest among these `` @xmath164outliers '' is hdf ",
    "n3259652 , that is marked by a large circle in fig  [ madau ] and whose spectral distribution and best fitting spectrum is shown in fig  [ hdf173 ] .",
    "this object has a large @xmath152 because it is undetected in @xmath156 and is the brightest object among this class ( these objects are undetected in @xmath156 , so that the @xmath152 should be read as lower limits ) , and has a spectroscopic redshift of 4.58 and a photometric redshift @xmath167 .",
    "it is fitted by the spectrum of a star  forming galaxy with a significant amount of dust ( @xmath141 with an smc extinction law ) to account for the large @xmath152 and @xmath153 observed colors .",
    "as can be seen from fig  [ hdf173 ] , the unique identification of this galaxy is made possible by the additional constraints provided by the ir bands : the best - fitting solution when the j , h and k@xmath0 band are not used corresponds indeed to an evolved galaxy at @xmath168 , consistent with the m98 plot ( as for all the objects in the spectroscopic sample , the photometric redshift does not depend on how non - detection in the b band is treated ) .    to evaluate the effect of the ir bands on the photometric redshift selection of high @xmath22 galaxies , and in particular on these `` z-4 outliers ''",
    ", we have obtained a fit on the hdf ",
    "n and hdf ",
    "s samples after removal of the ir bands .",
    "the comparison between the 7bands and the 4bands photometric redshifts is shown in fig  [ noir ] .",
    "it is shown that , while all the objects selected with the m98 criteria are assigned at @xmath127 also with only 4 optical bands , a substantial number of the `` @xmath164 outliers '' is placed at @xmath169 when the ir bands are removed .",
    "these objects have redshifts @xmath170 , and are typically fitted with significant amounts of dust [ @xmath171 . in all these cases the role of ir bands is to constrain the fit to relatively small values of @xmath172 , even in the cases where only upper limits exist in the ir , with the result of discarding models of evolved or dusty galaxies at lower @xmath22 that could easily mimic the red @xmath152 and @xmath153 optical colors .",
    "also the `` @xmath164 outliers '' that are placed at @xmath170 irrespective of the inclusion of ir bands ( a total of 6 out of 54 ) are selected among models with @xmath173 , that were present also in the m98 synthetic grid but not included in the selection criteria .",
    "respect to the m98 approach , the faint objects with large @xmath174 and @xmath175 were also discarded by not only because of their colors but also because they fade beyond the @xmath176 limit applied by m98 .",
    "not suprisingly , the situation is different in our ground  based images .",
    "if we remove the ir bands from the nttdf sample , all the @xmath177 candidate are found as well , and all the @xmath178 candidates by g98 are found by photometric redshifts , and viceversa .",
    "the reason lays in the different spectral sampling of the two filter sets .",
    "the spectral region covered by the three filters @xmath156 , @xmath165 and @xmath179 , where lyman@xmath74 blanketing starts to affect the hdf filter set already at @xmath180 , is sampled by 4 different filters ( @xmath181 ) in the ground based observations used here or by other groups .",
    "_ summarizing , the @xmath182 candidates that are selected with photometric redshifts in the hdfn+s data set and that lay far from the m98 region are typically predicted to be objects at @xmath170 with substantial amount of dust , i.e. a class of objects which multicolor criteria are biased against_. the ir bands are often required with the hdf filter set to include these objects in the sample .",
    "a correction of similar amplitude to the m98 criteria for dusty objects has been derived by steidel et al 1999 using the observed color distribution of galaxies in their spectroscopic survey at @xmath183 .    _ it is also worth emphasizing that the differences between the methods have not been tested with spectroscopic follow  up in a systematic way_. it is certainly reassuring that hdf ",
    "n3259652 , that lays outside the m98 area albeit it is at @xmath184 , is recovered with the photometric redshift analysis , but the major differences arise from the fainter sample , where the constraints from the ir bands are less stringent and the noise on the observed magnitudes is larger .",
    "another issue that should not be underestimated concerns the differences among different algorithms used for source detection and measure , even on the same data . based on the same set of hdf  n and hdf ",
    "s images , casertano et al 2000 find a larger number of @xmath185 candidates than are found in the stony brook catalogs , at the same magnitudes and adopting the same m98 criteria , and find that the hdf ",
    "n shows less candidates respect to the hdf ",
    "s , contrary again to what it is found in the stony brook catalogs .",
    "we conclude with a comment on fig  [ noir ] : we note that , as expected , the lack of ir bands causes a relatively large scatter in the @xmath186 region , the region where the major spectral breaks fall in the ir bands",
    ". however , the number of completely discrepant redshifts ( @xmath187 ) is limited . to some extent ,",
    "this reflects the fact that for a typical object the s / n ratio of the wfpc bands is always much higher than that of the ir bands , so that they dominate the @xmath2 even when the ir bands are included .",
    "it is well known that galactic stars are one of the main sources of foreground interlopers that may be identified as high redshift galaxies . as discussed in sect .",
    "2.3 , we have applied a pure morphological criterium to select bright stars in the hdf  s and in the nttdf , where spectroscopic follow  up is still lacking . it is interesting to note that 8 ( out of 32 ) of these `` morphological '' stars are assigned at @xmath170 by our photometric redshift code ( see also lanzetta 2000 ) .",
    "most of these objects are very bright ( @xmath188 ) so that the morphological classification is expected to be very robust , since high redshift galaxies are compact but resolved in high quality images , as shown by giavalisco et al 1996 and giallongo et al 2000 .",
    "however , we have complemented the morphological selection with a comparison with the stellar library by pickles 1998 , that we have used as input to our photometric redshift code .",
    "we have therefore compared the @xmath189 obtained for each object in the hdf ",
    "s with the use of the pickles 1998 library with the @xmath190 obtained by the ordinary procedure .    we find that , while all bright galaxies are very poorly fitted by any stellar template , with @xmath191 ( typically by a factor of 100 ) , 85% of the stars selected by morphological criteria have @xmath192 and , in particular , five of the @xmath170 candidates have @xmath193 .",
    "two typical examples are shown in fig  [ mstar ] .",
    "it is shown that the high redshift identification comes from the flat continuum at long wavelengths , coupled with the large spectral break in the bluer bands - all features typical of high redshift galaxies ( see previous section ) . however , they are better fitted by an m star spectral template because of the relatively gentle fading - when compared to the abrupt drop due to the igm at @xmath163 - at blue wavelengths and the negative slope at @xmath194 that are both typical of m stars .",
    "we conclude that also the color properties of these objects support the morphological classification of faint halo stars .",
    "it is important to emphasize that , once bright m  stars ( i.e. objects that correspond to the morphological criteria discussed above ) are removed , _ no other convincing candidate at @xmath24 is found in the hdf  s sample_. in addition to the photometric redshift predictions , this can be tested directly by looking at the multicolor data : no object in the stony brook catalog of the hdf ",
    "s is detected in @xmath115 ( at @xmath195 ) but not in @xmath196 , contrary to what is observed in the objects detected so far at @xmath197 in the hdf ",
    "n ( lanzetta et al 1996 , spinrad et al 1998 ) . as a result , the uv luminosity density @xmath198 at @xmath199 is still poorly determined , since it changes by a factor of @xmath200 between the hdf ",
    "n and the hdf  s at @xmath199 ( fontana et al 1999b ) .",
    "this paper presents the photometric redshift catalogs that have been used in previous papers to investigate different aspects of the evolution of galaxies in the high redshift universe , such as the history of the uv luminosity density and the number of massive galaxies already assembled at early epochs ( fontana et al 1999b ) and the evolution of galaxy sizes ( poli et al 1999 , giallongo et al 2000 ) .    a new deep multicolor ( ubvrijk@xmath0 ) photometric catalog has been produced of the galaxies in the ntt deep field and in the slightly overlapping field centered on the @xmath1 quasar br1202 - 07 .",
