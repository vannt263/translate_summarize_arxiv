    "the northern filament has a projected length of @xmath12 ( @xmath67  pc ) and appears roughly linear on the plane of the sky .",
    "this filament is known as barnard  18 ( hereafter b18 ; * ? ? ?",

    "the southern filament splits roughly into two halves . the western half is usually known as lynds dark nebula  1536 , or l1536 @xcite .",
    "the eastern half is known as the reflection nebula gn  04.32.8 @xcite .",
    "the morphology of this filament appears to change in fig  [ maps ] from l1536 to gn  04.32.8 .",
    "l1536 appears broadly similar to the clumps in the b18 filament , but in the region of gn  04.32.8 the filament is fainter .",
    "the reflection nebula gn  04.32.8 contains the star hp  tau which appears as a point source surrounded by a crescent shaped feature in the herschel maps , suggestive of interaction between the point source and the cloud .",
    "@xcite used the vlba to measure a parallax distance to hp  tau of 161.2 @xmath14 0.9 pc .",
    "the interaction of the star with the cloud would imply that this part of the cloud is also at that distance .",
    "the plane - of - sky separation of the two filaments is @xmath62@xmath15 which , at 161  pc , would equate to about 5.5  pc .",
    "there is some suggestion in co surveys , however , that the filaments are not at the same distance @xcite .",
    "given that uncertainty we use , as stated earlier , the established distance of 140pc for the entire cloud @xcite .",
    "if the southern filament is at @xmath16pc and the northern filament is closer to the canonical @xmath17pc then the two filaments could be separated by up to @xmath620  pc along the line of sight .",
    "comparing the left - hand panel of fig  [ maps ] with _ herschel _ observations of some other regions in the gould belt , interesting differences appear .",
    "for example , compared to the aquila region @xcite , the region displayed in fig  [ maps ] shows relatively little change in colour , and thus temperature , between different parts of the cloud .",
    "the coldest , densest parts appear slightly redder than the average , with only isolated points of blue ( i.e. , warm ysos ) . in contrast , the equivalent image of aquila @xcite shows far more variation , with large areas appearing red and the warm w40 nebula showing up clearly in blue .",
    "this difference is not an artefact of the false - colour imaging ; it represents a real difference between the aquila and taurus star - forming regions .",
    "there is far more variation in temperature across the aquila region ( @xmath61030k , partially due to w40 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) than in taurus ( @xmath61015k ) .    the mass of the taurus molecular cloud ( @xmath18  @xcite ) and the aquila molecular cloud ( @xmath19  @xcite ) are comparable , although the total area mapped by herschel in taurus is @xmath20% larger",
    "note that this study only presents a small part of that area .",
    "aquila is also a region with on - going low - mass star formation with a core - mass function that peaks at @xmath21 .",
    "see section  [ mrsec ] for a discussion of the masses of cores in this part of taurus .",
    "the column density , @xmath22 , map of the taurus s1-s2 region was reconstructed by fitting the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of each pixel in the _ herschel _ map . before fitting the pixel",
    "seds we must calibrate the data in surface brightness units , account for the map zero - point , and then colour - correct each pixel .",
    "the default calibration of the pacs data is already in surface brightness units .",
    "we converted the spire data from point - source to extended calibration and then to surface brightness units using the recommended factors @xcite .",
    "fitting pixel - by - pixel seds can be sensitive to systematic offsets between the different wavelengths . for the spire or pacs data alone",
    ", such offsets would not be a problem , as a common baseline removal / mapping technique should remove a common background .",
    "however , different techniques are used for the spire and pacs instruments .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to perform some measure of large - scale background correction at each wavelength , e.g. , by masking a source and estimating a local background ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , globally filtering the map , or using additional data to fit a zero - point .",
    "we chose the latter as it allows us to fix the background over the entire area .",
    "we therefore followed the method described by @xcite to estimate the absolute flux level towards the s1-s2 region from _",
    "planck _ and _ iras _ data .",
    "the median absolute fluxes for each wavelength are listed on line 2 of table [ tab ] .",
    "once the backgrounds had been established , the data were convolved to a common resolution ( the spire @xmath23@xmath0 m psf , 36  fwhm ) using the @xcite convolution kernels and then co - aligned on the @xmath23@xmath0 m pixel - grid ( 14  pixel width ) .",
    "we colour - correct each pixel using the standard spire @xcite and pacs @xcite factors in an iterative cycle .",
    "the spectral index at each wavelength is calculated and the required colour correction factor is interpolated from the tabulated values . the correction is then applied to the data and a new set of spectral indices are calculated .",
    "this corrected set of indices are in turn used to calculate an updated correction .",
    "the spectral - index / correction - factor cycle is repeated until the correction factors converge or a maximum of 20 cycles is reached .    for each position where there are greater than 3@xmath9 detections between 160500@xmath0 m we fit the function @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the flux density at frequency @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the mass - per - pixel , @xmath28 is the planck function for a blackbody with temperature @xmath29 , and @xmath30 is the distance to the source @xcite .",
    "the dust mass opacity @xmath31 is paramaterized as @xmath32 and is referenced against a value of 0.1@xmath33g@xmath34 at 1thz @xcite , which assumes a gas - to - dust mass ratio of 100 .",
    "the distance to taurus is @xmath35pc and we assume that @xmath11 .",
    "there are therefore only two free parameters @xmath29 and @xmath27 for each fit .",
    "the mass - per - pixel is converted to a column density by , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the column number density of h@xmath38 , @xmath39 is the mean particle mass ( @xmath40 is the mass of a hydrogen atom and @xmath0 was taken to be 2.86 , assuming the gas is @xmath41 h@xmath38 by mass ) , and @xmath42 is the area of each pixel .",
    "the levenberg - marquardt least - squares minimisation package mpfit @xcite was used for the sed fitting .",
    "we use a single temperature fit over the range 160500@xmath0 m .",
    "this neglects line - of - sight temperature variations and gives a temperature that is representative of the entire column of material , not just its coldest component , see @xcite for a discussion .",
    "we explored a 2-component temperature fit by including mips @xcite 24@xmath0 m data from the taurus _",
    "legacy program ( * ? ? ?",
    "* made available from the _ spitzer _ science centre ) . for positions where there are 3@xmath9 detections at 24  @xmath0 m , 70  @xmath0 m , and 160  @xmath0 m , it was possible to fit the sed at 24 - 500  @xmath0 m with the sum of two components .",
    "in practise this only applied close to the 70@xmath0 m compact sources as these fields contain no extended - area of strong short wavelength emission .",
    "the cold component fit was virtually identical to the original 160500@xmath0 m fit so we only use a single component fit .",
    "fig  [ maps ] shows the @xmath37 and @xmath29 results ( for the cold component ) .",
    "column density contours , which start at 5-@xmath9 and increase geometrically with each increment being 1.5 times the previous contour level , are shown on the middle and right maps for reference .",
    "the temperature map shows minima of @xmath43k in b18-e 2 , b18-e 1 , and l1536 - 1 , with the rest of the higher - density filamentary material lying at a temperature of @xmath44k .",
    "away from the filaments the temperature rises to @xmath45k .",
    "the first analysis of _ planck _ data towards taurus found a similar temperature towards dense regions . @xcite",
    "used iras 60@xmath0 m and isophot 200@xmath0 m maps of the tmc-2 clump to infer two distinct dust temperature components , a warm 20k component which followed the 60@xmath0 m emission and a colder 12.5k dense component that followed the 200@xmath0 m emission .",
    "their colder component is similar to that which we measure towards the filaments .",
    "the intensity uncertainty of each pixel at each wavelength is taken as the quadratic sum of three components .",
    "the first component is @xmath46 , the pixel - to - pixel rms measured on the resampled , regridded intensity map .",
    "this was calculated by subtracting a map smoothed by twice the beam fwhm from the original map and measuring the standard deviation of the remaining intensity .",
    "the calculated values of @xmath46 are listed in table [ tab ] .",
    "a map uncertainty product is available from the herschel map making processes , but it was found that the pacs uncertainty maps contained striping associated with masked / bad pixels . while this effect is small ( @xmath47% of the overall uncertainty ) it is correlated with the scan direction and , if included in the fitting , propogates to the output column density map .",
    "therefore , we instead use the per pixel rms across all wavelengths .",
    "this method avoids any scaling that would have been necessary due to confusion effects from the resampling / regridding process .",
    "the other two uncertainty components are related to the intensity calibration . as described above",
    ", the total intensity is the sum of two components  the herschel measured intensity @xmath48 at each pixel and the absolute background level of the map @xmath49 .",
    "each of these has a separate systematic fractional uncertainty .",
    "we assume that the emission is extended , so the systematic fractional error @xmath50 is 12% for the spire bands @xcite and 10% for the pacs",
    "160@xmath0 m @xcite .",
    "the fractional error on the absolute background is @xmath51% @xcite .",
    "therefore , a pixel with total intensity @xmath52 , will have a total uncertainty given by @xmath53 in practise the second term dominates in regions of high intensity while the last term dominates in regions of low intensity .",
    "only the first term is used when determining whether the intensity of a pixel is statistically detected or not .",
    "the full value of @xmath54 is used for the sed fitting .",
    "the uncertainty on the @xmath37 fit is dominated by a systematic component of @xmath47% above a column density of @xmath55@xmath56 , a value similar to the systematic error in the intensity .",
    "the per pixel rms of the column density , calculated in the same manner as for the original intensity maps , is @xmath57@xmath56 .",
    "the uncertainty on the @xmath29 fit was found to be @xmath58k in regions where @xmath59k and @xmath60k in regions were @xmath61k .",
    "we tested our fitting procedure using synthetic seds with data - points matching the _ herschel _ bands .",
    "these were generated for a random - temperature @xmath62 in the range log(5/k)log(100/k ) .",
    "noise was added to the data - points and the synthetic sed plus noise was used to obtain @xmath63 in the above manner . in each case , the mean difference between the input and fitted temperature increased with the input temperature as the peak of the sed moved to shorter wavelengths outside of the _ herschel _ bands .",
    "indeed , the mean difference increased until a breakdown temperature , above which the synthetic sed could not be recovered .",
    "our typical calibration error is 10 - 12 per cent plus a component from the background .",
    "for the conservative case of 15 per cent noise , we can not recover temperatures above @xmath64k when using just 250 - 500@xmath0 m data - points and @xmath65k when 160@xmath0 m data - points are added .",
    "the maps contain many sources that are extended relative to the beam - size at each wavelength .",
    "the extraction of extended sources from regions of complex emission is a difficult process , and is one that many _ herschel _ surveys will face .",
    "there has been much debate as to which method is best for identifying extended sources in submillimetre surveys ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a comprehensive study of the current state of the art in this area has been carried out by the spire consortium within the _ herschel _ team , and it is still ongoing . for this first - look paper , we use a conservative variant of the well - known routine clumpfind @xcite , which we have called the cardiff source - finding algorithm .",
    "csar also retains information pertaining to the structure tree of sources within the field making it similar to other recent dendrogram @xcite or sub - structure codes @xcite . where csar differs is that the data are analysed as a pixel stream .",
    "this eliminates the need to pre - filter the map maxima and reduces the number of free parameters involved in its operation .",
    "csar is a seeded region - growth ( c.f .",
    "* ) style segmentation algorithm which can be run in either hierarchical or non - hierarchical modes .",
    "it is designed to identify contiguous regions , or clumps , on an intensity map that are considered significant by virtue of being : ( i ) resolved , namely that the clump area is greater than the telescope beam footprint ; ( ii ) having no resolved internal sub - structure ; and ( iii ) having a peak - to - clump minimum contrast ratio greater than 3@xmath9 , where @xmath9 is the mean pixel - to - pixel error .",
    "the clumps that the non - hierarchical version of @xmath66 finds are broadly equivalent to clumpfind s seed clumps before the application of its ` friends - of - friends ' algorithm @xcite .",
    "the differences between csar and clumpfind are illustrated in fig  [ fig : williams94 ] which is based on fig  2 .",
    "of @xcite .",
    "the red regions are the clumps found by the non - hierarchical version of @xmath66 while the blue regions show the clumps that would have been found by clumpfind .    the non - hierarchical version of @xmath66 works by sorting each pixel @xmath67 in the map into a list @xmath68 , in order of decreasing intensity .",
    "the first pixel in the list , @xmath69 , has the highest intensity on the map and is assigned a clump index @xmath70 .",
    "each pixel in the list is then considered in turn .",
    "the @xmath67th pixel is assigned a new clump index if it is a local maximum , i.e. , its neighbouring pixels have not already been assigned a clump index .",
    "a pixel that adjoins an existing clump takes that clump s index , i.e. , its neighbouring pixels share a single unique clump index .",
    "clumps grow as the routine proceeds down the intensity gradient , as each new pixel is considered .",
    "this process continues until two clumps collide , i.e. , where the @xmath67th pixel has immediate neighbours with more than one unique clump index .",
    "this point is equivalent to the position in fig  [ fig : williams94 ] where the red regions around peaks a and b touch .",
    "the @xmath67th pixel is then a bridging pixel between two clumps and the code must make a choice as to which clump it should be assigned to . each clump is tested to see if it is significant against the three criteria described above . if both clumps are significant , then they are marked as finished and are considered to have reached their maximum size before becoming blended .",
    "they are then excluded from further growth .",
    "if one or both of the clumps are not significant , then the clumps are merged .",
    "every pixel is processed in turn until a preset minimum intensity level , or the minimum on the map is reached .",
    "each surviving unmerged clump is then checked to make sure it matches the resolution and contrast criteria and any that straddle the edges of the mapped region are excluded .",
    "the hierarchical version of the csar algorithm uses the unblended clumps found by the non - hierarchical version as the tips of a structure tree or dendrogram . @xcite",
    "proposed the use of _ structure trees _ to measure hierarchical structure within ism clouds .",
    "these were constructed by decomposing a flux map into discrete grey - level masks .",
    "clumps were found independently at each grey - level and then cross - matched with overlapping clumps at the n-1 level .",
    "@xcite extended structure trees to work with three - dimensional isosurfaces in molecular line maps .",
    "a true dendrogram , as shown by @xcite , uses an arbitrary x - axis ( e.g. , a sorted , deprojected clump index ) to show the hierarchical structure of another quantity ( temperature , intensity , etc ) on the y - axis @xcite .",
    "it is possible to use the hierarchical version of csar to estimate the shared contribution from the surrounding emission , thereby overcoming any problems of the non - hierarchical version , which makes no attempt to deblend sources or to trace the wings of emission down into the surrounding cirrus .",
    "the assignment of clump indices and merging of non - significant clumps proceeds as for the non - hierarchical version except that colliding significant clumps are now allowed to merge .",
    "the state of those clumps is recorded at the point of collision .",
    "the black contours in fig  [ fig : williams94 ] show the clump boundaries at the point of merger .",
    "moving down the intensity scale , clumps a and b merge at the topmost black contour , the combined clump containing them then merges with clump c at the level of second highest black contour . in this manner",
    "a network of merging clumps is traced .",
    "each clump merger is a node in the structure tree with the unblended non - hierarchical clumps forming the upper - most branches of the tree .",
    "csar was run on the column density map of the s1-s2 region shown in figure  [ maps ] .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : csar1 ] and  [ fig : csar2 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : csar1 ] shows the dendrogram for those sources while figure  [ fig : csar2 ] shows a map of the sources extracted . over - plotted on figure  [ fig : csar2 ] are column density contours ( with levels repeated from figure  [ maps ] ) .",
    "csar found a single clump hierarchy with two dominant branches ( northern and southern filaments ) , the connection between these is shown by the lowest horizontal - line at @xmath71@xmath56 on figure  [ fig : csar1 ] . the clumps with indices below 77 are part of the b18 branch while clumps with indices above 77 are part of the l1536 branch .",
    "for each clump , we compute a position ( r.a , dec ) from the mean centre of the clump s half - power contour above its merger column density .",
    "the index of each clump is plotted at its position on figure  [ fig : csar2 ] .",
    "the border of each clump is effectively an isocontour and this level is used as that core s background level .",
    "the level is calculated from the ring of pixels immediately adjacent to each clump ( the need to terminate a clump s growth with an unassigned pixel automatically means that no clumps abut pixels from another clump ) . the integrated count ( either mass or flux density depending on the map type ) of each clump",
    "is then computed by subtracting the isocontour boundary level from each pixel in the clump and summing the remainder .",
    "the size for all csar sources has been taken as the deconvolved effective radius of a circle with the same area as the source .",
    "fig  [ figb3 ] shows column density maps extracted from fig  [ maps ] for a sample four csar cores with approximately the same effective radius .",
    "the two cores on the left ( cores 47 and 20 ) are coincident with the scatter of blue - triangles in fig  [ mr ] .",
    "they have masses in excess of 2  @xmath72 and show evidence for being cooler at their centres ( see fig  [ maps ] ) .",
    "the two cores on the right ( cores 38 and 105 ) have approximately the same deconvolved size , @xmath73pc , as the first two , but have masses less than 2  @xmath72",
    ".    the two higher - mass cores have simbad entries and are coincident with objects 35 and 31 from the h@xmath13co@xmath74 survey of @xcite .",
    "core 47 has a herschel mass of 5.4@xmath75 and radius of 0.06pc while the h@xmath13co@xmath74 core is it coincident with has a virial mass of 1.5@xmath75 and a radius of 0.04pc .",
    "virial masses scale with @xmath76 ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) , so scaling the @xcite virial mass for core 47 to the _ herschel _ radius gives a mass of 3.4@xmath75 .",
    "core 20 and the h@xmath13co@xmath74 core it is coincident with have the same radius , 0.06pc , but core 20 has a mass of 2.1@xmath75 and the h@xmath13co@xmath74 core has a virial mass of 0.6@xmath75 .",
    "thus , the herschel mass for each core is higher than the virial mass computed from h@xmath13co@xmath74 as would be expected if both cores were gravitationally bound .",
    "conversely , the lower - mass core 38 is coincident with object 31 from the co survey of @xcite and core 105 is not coincident with any extended structure in the simbad database . the mass and size of co object 31 is significantly higher than for the herschel core ( 12 versus 1@xmath75 and 0.21 versus 0.058pc ) .",
    "therefore , the co core appears to be equivalent to an entire sub - branch of the herschel dendrogram and not a single leaf - node .",
    "figure  [ fig : csar1 ] and [ figb3 ] show that the same _ herschel _ observations are able to map simultaneously both well - known dense cores and previously uncatalogued lower density cores , and that the structure in the _ herschel _ maps can be characterised by csar .",
    "csar was applied to the column density maps in its hierarchical mode and structures were found on scales in the range 0.0242.7pc .",
    "this result is to be expected , since molecular clouds generally contain structure on a variety of scales .",
    "a total of 236 nested - sources ( which we call nodes ) were found in the hierarchy , 115 of which do not contain resolved substructure .",
    "a dendrogram of the hierarchy is shown in figure  [ fig : csar1 ] .",
    "we also ran the getsources algorithm on our data @xcite .",
    "this routine found the same sources as csar , and others besides .",
    "getsources uses all five wavelengths simultaneously to identify sources , and we saw that most of the additional sources it found were seen only in a subset of wavelengths .",
    "furthermore , getsources did not find the large clumps found by csar because it does not define sources as such .",
    "any source containing substructure is broken into its components by getsources .",
    "consequently , all of the sources discussed here were found by both algorithms .",
    "we believe this is the most robust way to proceed .",
    "fig  [ mr ] shows the mass - size relation for the sources that we have found ( following fig .  4 of * ? ? ?",
    "the solid red circles indicate the individual resolved objects with no visible substructure and the open red circles denote the objects that we found with substructure .",
    "the two types of object have median masses of 0.20 , and 25m@xmath77 respectively and median sizes of 0.055 and 0.35pc respectively .",
    "the root clump  the total of everything in the hierarchy  has a mass of 880m@xmath77 and an equivalent size of 2.7pc . for comparison ,",
    "the open and solid grey squares show data for prestellar cores in ophiuchus @xcite and orion @xcite respectively , observed in the millimetre / submillimetre continuum .",
    "note that the same assumptions regarding mass calculations from flux densities were used in calculating the masses for orion and ophiuchus as for the current survey of taurus .",
    "hence , any offsets between @xcite , @xcite and the current data are not due to different assumptions about mass opacities , or equivalent systematic uncertainties .",
    "we use the column density map to calculate masses .",
    "the alternative method would be to calculate the core s flux densities at each wavelength using a local background and then fit the sed .",
    "we checked what difference this second method would have on the leaf - node sources by fitted seds ( using the same method as for the pixel - by - pixel seds ) to background subtracted flux densities measured using the csar extraction contours .",
    "it was found that using a local background increased the core masses by @xmath7820 - 30% on average .",
    "this increase is due to the removal of flux associated with warmer , overlaying material , however , using this method discards the information content of the dendrogram , which we wish to preserve , and requires one to have a priori knowledge of the core locations .",
    "the advantage of the dendrogram / column density method is that it preserves information on the global properties of the region and supplies local core properties in a single self - consistent operation .",
    "analysts of molecular cloud structure have pursued the idea that there exists a power - law relationship between the mass of a core , @xmath27 , and its radius @xmath79 , such that @xmath80 .",
    "@xcite found @xmath81 , which is equivalent to @xmath82 , based on a sample of mainly @xmath13co observations .",
    "@xcite found a value of @xmath83 for a sample of clouds , which they studied in co. a study of co clouds in the inner - galaxy molecular ring found a power - law with @xmath84 @xcite .",
    "however , the power - law exponent as measured by denser gas tracers ( e.g. the submillimetre continuum ) appears to be different .",
    "for example , @xcite found for dense cores in perseus that a power - law exponent value closer to @xmath61.5 was a better fit to their data .",
    "@xcite showed that the exponent can be influenced by the choice of source extraction algorithm .",
    "the dataset of @xcite and @xcite did not include data from taurus , so we also include in fig  [ mr ] literature data from two other surveys of taurus .",
    "the open blue triangles show cores in taurus observed by @xcite in c@xmath850 ( 10 ) .",
    "these points can be fit by a power - law relationship with an exponent of @xmath86 , shown as a blue dashed line on fig  [ mr ] .",
    "this value of 2.4 is similar those found for co clouds by other authors @xcite .",
    "@xcite carried out an h@xmath13co@xmath74 emission survey of taurus . the higher critical density for collisional excitation of h@xmath13co@xmath74 ( 10 ) , of @xmath87@xmath88 , over c@xmath85o ( 10 ) , of @xmath89@xmath88 , allowed @xcite to probe denser parts of the same clouds .",
    "the filled blue triangles in fig  [ mr ] show the virial masses calculated from these data .",
    "they also appear to follow a power - law trend .",
    "we fit to this trend a power - law relationship with an exponent value of @xmath90 ( solid blue line ) .",
    "this value is consistent with that found for dense cores in perseus by @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath13co@xmath74 masses are virial masses ( @xmath91 , assuming weak or no linewidth - size correlation , c.f .",
    "fig 7 . of @xcite ) , so the value of this exponent in not unexpected .",
    "the lowest mass csar cores are consistent with the trend for co clumps while the highest mass csar cores are in the parameter regime of the h@xmath13co@xmath74 ( 10 ) sources .",
    "this shows that , for a given radius , we are sensitive to sources over a range of 2 dex in mass . a number of the substructured csar clumps are consistent with the @xmath92 power - law fitted to the c@xmath85o sources .",
    "this means that we can detect the same material as the c@xmath85o ( 10 ) survey , albeit over a wider range of spatial scale .",
    "thus , the _ herschel _ csar sources are coincident with all of the mass - size regimes shown by the other tracers .",
    "@xcite showed that c@xmath85o remained unsaturated below @xmath93 and @xcite showed that co and dust masses for parsec sized clumps were in good agreement . we see a similar effect in fig  [ mr ] where the clumps from our dendrogram that have radii of @xmath58pc have masses which are comparable to co clumps of the same size @xcite .",
    "however , the case is different at smaller scales where interpretation of individual cores is hampered by the spatial filtering of ground - based bolometer observations @xcite , the relationship between co mass and @xmath94 becomes non - linear above @xmath95mag @xcite , and by the differing chemical history of each core @xcite .",
    "the high - spatial range of herschel and the reliability of dust mass measurements makes it the perfect telescope to observe objects on a wide range of scales .",
    "@xcite produced a mass - size diagram using a dendrogram technique for multiple clouds .",
    "they concluded that the mass - size data were not consistent with a constant column density relationship ( @xmath96 ) and that cores in low - mass star formation regions had masses that lie below a threshhold with an exponent of @xmath97 ( close to the solid blue line in figure [ mr ] ) .",
    "however , @xcite had to use two different data - sets to bridge the same parameter space .",
    "what herschel adds to this type of analysis is its ability to sample a larger range of spatial scales in a single map and to extract a greater dynamic mass range of object for a given radius .",
    "nevertheless , the linear part of the mass - size relation in the top - left of figure  [ mr ] , as the structure tree folds into the root node , does appear to be inconsistent with a global value of @xmath96 in agreement with @xcite .    as mentioned previously",
    ", @xcite found that cores seen in the submillimetre continuum ( squares on fig  [ mr ] ) and clumps seen by molecular line tracers such as co ( grey shaded area on fig  [ mr ] ) lie in very different areas of the mass - size plane .",
    "our herschel data allows is to study the two possible explanations for this difference : either selection effects are at play , or there are two fundamentally different populations of object , i.e. , low density non - star forming starless cores ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and higher density prestellar cores @xcite .",
    "if the latter explanation were correct , then the populations would remain distinct in the mass - size plane , even after selection effects were corrected .",
    "however , _",
    "herschel _ is sensitive to much lower column density material than previous ground - based submillimetre continuum arrays .",
    "consequently , the sensitivity limit of _ herschel _ continuum data lies further to the lower right on fig  [ mr ] .",
    "hence , _ herschel _ effectively removes the old selection effect problems , and so its data should be able to settle this issue .",
    "previous results from _ herschel _ observations of other regions have been moderately inconclusive in resolving this issue . in more active star - forming regions such as aquila @xcite and vela @xcite , the cores found by _",
    "herschel _ lie in the same part of the diagram as the ground - based submillimetre continuum cores , indicating that they are mostly prestellar cores . in non star - forming regions , such as the polaris , the cores found by _",
    "herschel _ lie in the same band of the diagram as the co clumps @xcite , indicating that they were mostly co clumps ( c.f .",
    "a gap remained in the mass - size relation plot between these two samples .",
    "now we can see from fig  [ mr ] that the _ herschel _ cores in the taurus star - forming region lie largely in the gap between the ground - based continuum cores and co clumps .",
    "their appearance rules out the possibility that there are two distinct populations of cores . instead",
    ", the _ herschel _ data indicate that all cores are part of the same population .",
    "furthermore , this conclusion leads to the hypothesis that lower density cores can evolve into prestellar cores by migrating across this diagram before collapsing to form protostars .",
    "a suggested form of this evolution has been previously proposed by @xcite .",
    "further results from the _ herschel _ gould belt survey in other regions should help to resolve the exact manner of the evolution of prestellar cores .",
