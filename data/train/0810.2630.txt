    "the advent of femtosecond lasers has initiated major progress in the study of non - adiabatic surface dynamics on a wide range of systems .",
    "photo - induced desorption had already been observed for a few adsorbate systems@xcite using low - intensity nanosecond laser pulses , but high - intensity femtosecond laser pulses have been shown to induce desorption in a large class of adsorbate systems@xcite and induce chemical reactions which can not proceed by thermal heating.@xcite    the mechanism attributed to these reactions is excitation of substrate electrons by the laser pulse .",
    "a single hot electrons can then interact with an initially unoccupied adsorbate resonance thus asserting a force on the adsorbate nuclei which may then lead to desorption induced by electronic transitions ( diet ) .",
    "using femtosecond lasers it is possible to reach high densities of excited electrons resulting in a new dominating mechanism - desorption induced by multiple electronic transitions ( dimet)@xcite where several hot electrons interact with the adsorbate .    a different method to produce hot electron based on a metal - insulator - metal ( mim )",
    "heterostructure was suggested by gadzuk@xcite . with an ideal mim device it is possible to tune hot electrons to any desired resonance of an adsorbate system and",
    "the approach thereby suggests the highly attractive possibility of performing selective chemistry at surfaces .",
    "such devices have been constructed and characterized@xcite and comprise a promising candidate for future hot electron femtochemistry experiments .    the theoretical framework to describe the non - adiabatic dynamics resulting from a hot electron interacting with an adsorbate is usually based on the concept of potential energy surfaces ( pes ) . in the born - oppenheimer approximation",
    "the electrons are assumed to remain in their ground state and are thus decoupled from the nuclei .",
    "this allow one to map out a ground state pes for the nuclei by calculating the electronic energy for each position of the nuclei .",
    "similarly , when an initially unoccupied resonance becomes occupied a new excited state pes arises which has its minimum at a different location than the ground state pes and a force is exerted on the adsorbate .",
    "several models have emerged to deal with non - adiabatic dynamics at surfaces but they are usually limited by the difficulty to obtain reliable excited state pess and most theoretical results are based on model potentials.@xcite    an often used method to treat the extreme dimet regime with many contributing electrons is using an electronic friction model.@xcite the hot electrons are then assumed to thermalize rapidly and the influence of the electrons on the adsorbate are treated statistically using an electronic temperature which can be several thousand kelvin .",
    "the conceptual picture is that of a hot fermi distribution with a tail partially overlapping an adsorbate resonance and thereby exerting a force on the adsorbate .",
    "however , correct calculation of the temperature dependent friction still requires knowledge of the excited state pes .",
    "the subject of this paper will be the application of two - dimensional excited state pess to calculate desorption probabilities",
    ". we will be particularly interested in the diet regime where the hot electron has a known energy as relevant for the mim device and the few - electron dimet regime .",
    "although the friction models have enjoyed some success@xcite , there is still a need of a microscopic non - statistical model of dimet to test the assumption of thermally equilibrated electrons and to bridge the gap to the diet regime .",
    "furthermore , the hot electron femtochemistry relevant to the mim device can certainly not be described using an electronic temperature since all electrons are tuned to a specific energy .",
    "we start by summarizing the method of linear expansion @xmath0scf - dft@xcite used to calculate the excited state pess and note some qualitative features using co on pt(111 ) as an example .",
    "we then discuss the models used to obtain desorption probabilities based on the calculated potential energy surfaces .",
    "first an adiabatic model in which the adsorbate jumps between the ground and excited state potentials is presented . a general non - adiabatic newns - anderson like model@xcite",
    "is then introduced and the connection to potential energy surfaces is explained . this model with linear coupling",
    "has previously been solved@xcite and applied to the one - dimensional desorption problem with model parameters@xcite .",
    "we extend these results to a two - dimensional adsorbate and obtain the non - adiabatic coupling parameters from calculated excited state potential energy surfaces . in the diet regime",
    "the model will be used to show that for small excited state lifetimes the main channel of energy transfer is the internal degree of freedom , and we emphasize its importance in desorption dynamics .",
    "we compare the calculated desorption probabilities for co and no on four transition metal surfaces and note some general features of the desorption dynamics .",
    "the scattering probabilities obtained in the model are then generalized to include adsorbates in any vibrationally excited state which allow us to extend the calculations to include a substrate temperature and to treat the dimet regime within the model . in the appendix",
    "it is shown how to expand excited states within the projector augmented wave formalism and the results and generalizations of scattering amplitude calculations are summarized .",
    "the potential energy surfaces were obtained using the code ` gpaw`@xcite which is a real - space density functional theory ( dft ) code that uses the projector augmented wave method.@xcite in all our calculations we used the revised perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( rpbe ) exchange - correlation functional @xcite since this has been designed to perform well for molecules adsorbed on surfaces , and has been shown to perform better than the original pbe functional@xcite both for isolated molecules @xcite and for adsorbed moleculeshammer . for each metal we set up a closed - packed surface consisting of three atomic layers with the top layer being relaxed .",
    "10   of vacuum was then introduced above the slab and 0.25 monolayer of adsorbate molecules relaxed at either top or hcp hollow site .",
    "we then mapped out two - dimensional ground state potential energy surfaces in terms of the internal stretch and the center of mass ( com ) to surface distance coordinate using 12 irreducible k - points and a grid spacing of 0.2  .    to find the excited state potential energy surfaces we use the method of linear expansion @xmath0scf which we have published in a previous work@xcite and implemented in ` gpaw ` .",
    "in the previous publication we have tested the method against inverse photo - emission spectroscopy , and found that it performed well for molecules chemisorbed on surfaces.@xcite in each step of the self consistency cycle an electron is removed from the fermi level , the density of an excited state is added to the total density , and the band energy of this state is added to the total energy . to get the band energy right we need to expand the excited state on the kohn - sham orbitals found in each iteration .",
    "the method is thus a generalization of the usual @xmath0scf where occupations numbers are changed . instead of changing occupation numbers",
    "we occupy an orbital which is not an eigenstate of the ks hamiltonian but a superposition of eigenstates in such a way that the state is as close as possible to the original molecular state .",
    "we refer to appendix [ paw ] for details on how to do this within the projector augmented wave formalism .",
    "the excited states used in this paper are the anti - bonding @xmath1 orbitals of no and co.    in the previous publication,@xcite we investigated the influence of the interactions between neighboring super cells for different super - cell sizes , and found that the size - dependency of the excitation energy is consistent with an electrostatic dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "already for a @xmath2 surface cell , the interaction energy has become small , and furthermore this interaction energy will have little influence on the slope of the excited - state pes , and thus little influence on the calculated desorption rates .",
    "for this reason , and to keep the calculations manageable , we use a @xmath2 surface cell .    as an example",
    "we show the two - dimensional excited state pes superimposed on a ground state pes in the case of co on pt(111 ) top site in fig .",
    "[ fig : pes ] .",
    "the molecules adsorb with the molecular axis perpendicular to the surface with carbon closest to the top site . due to the symmetry of the @xmath1 orbital and the geometry at the ground state minimum we can not induce forces parallel to the surface if the molecule is at the ground state minimum when excited .",
    "the excited state could have unstable extremal points with respect to the degrees of freedom parallel to the surface , but the model we apply in this work only depend on the degrees of freedom with non - vanishing derivatives on the excited state pes and we thus assume that the center of mass ( com ) and internal stretch degrees of freedom should capture the essential desorption dynamics of the considered systems .    ) potential energy surfaces for co adsorbed on pt(111 ) - top site .",
    "the coverage is 0.25 monolayer . ]    since the excited molecule has an extra electron in an anti - bonding orbital the excited molecule is expected to have a larger equilibrium bond length and this is also what we observe .",
    "a popular and conceptually simple way of explaining desorption in one - dimensional models of diet is the antoniewicz mechanism,@xcite where the excited molecule induces an image charge on the surface which results in an attractive force on the surface .",
    "the excited molecule is then accelerated towards the surface and eventually decays to the steep wall of the ground state morse potential . from fig .",
    "[ fig : pes ] we observe a qualitatively different behavior : the com of the excited molecules experience a repulsive force accelerating the com of the molecule away from the surface .",
    "this is due to the effect of the bond length expansion and the fact that the @xmath1 orbital have a large density in the vicinity of the carbon atom which gives a repulsion that dominates the image charge attraction",
    ". it will be shown below that for the considered systems it is primarily excitation of the internal degree of freedom which is responsible for the large energy transfers leading to desorption .",
    "the potential energy surfaces for co adsorbed on pd , rh and ru show very similar qualitative features .",
    "the timescale at which adsorbates dissipate energy to the substrate is typically on the order of picoseconds@xcite and since the oscillation times for the two modes is @xmath3 ( see section [ sec : par ] ) we will assume that the molecule has plenty of time to desorb if it has absorbed the required energy from a hot electron .",
    "this is the major assumption we will impose and thus when we refer to desorption rates in the following it is the rate of transferring at least of the energy needed for a molecule to desorb .    assuming a lorentzian resonance with full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) @xmath4 centered at @xmath5 , the probability that a hot electron of energy @xmath6 desorbs the molecule becomes @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the probability of a desorption event when the molecule is excited at @xmath9 and decays at time @xmath10 .",
    "using classical dynamics the probability @xmath8 can be obtained by propagating the molecule on the excited state pes according to the forces , evaluate the energy gain @xmath11 after time @xmath12 and put @xmath13 if @xmath14 and @xmath15 if @xmath16 .",
    "however , the short lifetime of the excited electron implies that classical molecular propagation on the excited state pes may not be a good approximation .",
    "in fact , the classical limit is obtained when the action @xmath17 on a representative path satisfies @xmath18 assuming a quadratic excited state potential of frequency @xmath19 and initial potential energy @xmath20 we can evaluate the action on a classical path between initial time @xmath21 and final time @xmath22 . for generic timescales one just obtains the usual condition of high excitation numbers @xmath23 , whereas for @xmath24 , the additional condition of @xmath25 needs to be satisfied in order to apply classical dynamics . in the case of co on pt(111 ) we have @xmath26 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pes ] ) and @xmath27 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pdos ] ) which gives @xmath28 .",
    "thus molecular propagation on the excited state pes is not expected to follow the classical equations of motion .",
    "below we will show an example where a classical analysis underestimates desorption probabilities by several orders of magnitude .",
    "this scheme could be extended to a quantum dynamical treatment of the molecule by propagating the molecular wavefunction using a two - pes hamiltonian .",
    "however , the method still rests on the born - oppenheimer approximation and the adiabatic concept of potential energy surfaces and thus can not be expected to fully capture the non - adiabatic entangled dynamics of the resonant electron and adsorbate coordinates .",
    "instead we consider a newns - anderson @xcite type hamiltonian with substrate states @xmath29 , a resonant state @xmath30 , adsorbate coordinates @xmath31 , an adiabatic adsorbate ground state potential @xmath32 , and a non - adiabatic coupling of the resonant electron to adsorbate coordinates @xmath33 @xmath34 the strength of the electronic coupling is expressed through the function : @xmath35 the model as such neglects the electron - electron interaction , but we assume that the important part of the electron - electron interactions is the restructuring of the metallic electrons when the resonance is occupied and that we can capture this effect in an effective non - adiabatic coupling . to do this",
    "we note that we can obtain @xmath33 as the expectation value differences of with the adsorbate at @xmath31 with and without an electron in the state @xmath30 .",
    "applying this to an interacting problem lead us to identify @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath32 are the potential energy surfaces of excited and ground states which we have obtained with linear expansion @xmath0scf - dft .    in the following",
    "we will apply the wide band limit which means that the individual coupling coefficients @xmath38 are assumed to vary slowly in energy and the density of states @xmath39 is taken as constant in the vicinity of the resonance .",
    "this gives an energy independent coupling @xmath40 and the resonance spectral function corresponding to the electronic part of becomes a lorentzian with fwhm @xmath41 .    even in the wide band limit it is quite difficult to handle the model analytically with arbitrary coupling function @xmath33 .",
    "in particular , we would like to calculate the probability that an incoming substrate electron of energy @xmath42 scatters inelastically on the resonance and is reflected back into the substrate with final energy @xmath43 .",
    "fortunately , the potential energy surfaces we are considering are close to being quadratic in the region of interest ( see fig . [",
    "fig : pes ] ) and the ground and excited state potentials have approximately the same curvature .",
    "taylor expanding @xmath32 to second order and @xmath33 to first order in the vicinity of the ground state equilibrium positions @xmath44 then gives @xmath45 with @xmath46 and @xmath47 where we have assumed that an appropriate transformation to normal coordinates has been performed .",
    "note that if the ground and excited state potentials are exactly quadratic with equal second derivatives , we can relate the coupling constants to the positions @xmath48 of the excited state potential minimum as @xmath49 with @xmath50 .",
    "the quantity @xmath51 then corresponds to an  initial quantum number  on the excited state surface and this becomes the effective dimensionless coupling constant in the model ( see appendix [ prob ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian has previously been subject to detailed analysis in the context of inelastic scattering@xcite and applied to desorption dynamics @xcite for the case of a one - dimensional adsorbate with model parameters .",
    "below we extend the results of refs . and to a two - dimensional adsorbate and calculated the coupling parameters @xmath52 from excited state potential energy surfaces .",
    "we also calculate scattering amplitudes for an adsorbate initially in an vibrationally excited state which enable us to apply the model to the dimet regime .      in eq .",
    "we show how to calculate the scattering probability @xmath53 that an incoming electron of energy @xmath42 excites the @xmath54 mode of a two - dimensional harmonic oscillator .",
    "the probability of transferring @xmath55 or more energy to the adsorbate can then be found by calculating @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the heaviside step function .",
    "the desorption rate can then be calculated by integrating this expression with the current density of incoming hot electrons .",
    "one should note that the probability @xmath58 of exciting the @xmath54 modes in a two - mode model is not just given by the product of single mode probabilities @xmath59 in a one - mode model .",
    "this is due to an indirect coupling of the two modes through the resonance .",
    "the result can be generalized to include the substrate temperature and we will examine the consequences of this below .",
    "if we assume that the time between individual inelastic scattering events is much longer than the scattering time itself , it is possible to regard multiple - electron desorption events as a sequence of single - electron scattering events .",
    "since we have extended the inelastic scattering probabilities to include situations where the molecule is initially in a vibrationally excited state , it is also possible to treat dimet events within the model .",
    "as an example , let us assume a single vibrational mode which is initially unoccupied ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "when a hot electron with energy @xmath61 scatters inelastically on the resonance the result will be a probability distribution @xmath62 for all vibrationally excited states @xmath63 of the molecule .",
    "if a second electron with energy @xmath64 now scatters on the resonance the probability distribution will change to @xmath65 and so forth .",
    "the probability @xmath66 of exciting the state @xmath67 given that the initial state were @xmath68 is calculated in eq . and",
    "we can write @xmath69 for a two - electron event and similar expressions for multiple - electron events .",
    "given an initial distribution of hot electrons we may then calculate the probability of a desorption event with any number of contributing electrons .",
    "the parameters in the desorption model are the width of the resonance @xmath41 , the frequencies of the normal modes @xmath70 , the excitation energy @xmath5 and the non - adiabatic coupling coefficients @xmath52 .",
    "we can not calculate @xmath41 from first principles but we estimate its value from the kohn - sham projected density of states .",
    "it is typically on the order of @xmath71 , but it will be instructive to treat it as a free parameter and examine how it affects desorption probabilities .",
    "the frequencies are obtained from a standard normal mode analysis and @xmath5 is obtained as the excitation energy at the ground state potential minimum .",
    "the coupling coefficients are determined by mapping out a small area of the excited state potential energy surface in the immediate vicinity of the ground state potential . in each of the considered systems we optimize the area such that it is small enough to be linear but large enough to suppress numerical fluctuations in the excited state energies .",
    "we then fit a linear function to this area and transform the derivatives to the normal modes .    in all the considered systems the calculated normal modes are similar but not identical to the standard com and internal stretch modes .",
    "for example with co on pt(111 ) the internal stretch and com modes are respectively : @xmath72 and @xmath73 whereas the calculated modes are in the directions @xmath74 and @xmath75 with respect to the @xmath76 coordinates normal to the surface . since the desorption probabilities are quite sensitive to the value of the non - adiabatic coupling constants it is important that we take the derivatives on the excited state pes with respect to the correct normal modes",
    ".    tables [ tab : par1 ] and [ tab : par2 ] below display the calculated parameters .",
    "we have only examined co at on - top sites and no at hcp hollow sites .",
    "no is seen to have much lower non - adiabatic coupling coefficients and excitation energies than co. the low excitation energies is due to the fact that no already has one electron in the anti - bonding orbital and the resonance thus has to lie close to the fermi level of the metal .",
    "the small coupling coefficients can also be traced to the ground state occupation of the @xmath1 orbital on no . in the kohn - sham picture",
    "we can imagine the resonance corresponding to @xmath1 lying right at the fermi level being partially occupied .",
    "when an extra electron is put into the orbital the resonance energy is increased due to hartree repulsion and the initial partial occupation is lost . in the true system things are more complicated , but the qualitative features are the same : exciting no results in less charge being transferred to the molecule than exciting co and thus a weaker non - adiabatic coupling . thus it is much harder to transfer energy to adsorbed no compared to co in a one electron event , but since the resonance is located much closer to the fermi level a thermal distribution of hot electrons is likely to result in more frequent scattering events than for co.    .parameters for co adsorbed at top site on four transition metals .",
    "all number are @xmath77 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the detuning very nicely follows the rule of thumb that @xmath78 in accordance with the picture of a compromise between the incoming and outgoing electron both being as close as possible to the center of the resonance @xmath5 .    in general it is easier for a single electron at the right energy to mediate a desorption event involving co than with no from all the considered systems . however , in a femtosecond laser pulse experiment the resulting hot electron distribution would have much lower occupation numbers at the co resonances than at a typical no resonance . for example taking platinum as an example with a thermal electron distribution at @xmath79 and referring to tables [ tab : par1 ] and [ tab : par2 ]",
    "we see that the electronic occupation numbers at the resonance energy of co and no relates as @xmath80 .",
    "we should also note that the excited state potential energy surfaces for adsorbed no is only quadratic in a small region near the minimum and the model hamiltonian is thus not expected to describe no as accurately as co.    the desorption probabilities are highly dependent on the resonance width @xmath41 which we can only estimate roughly from the kohn - sham projected density of states .",
    "in addition , the electronic lifetime of co on pt(111 ) has been shown to be highly dependent on coverage@xcite since the @xmath1 electrons becomes delocalized and quasistationary at certain coverages .",
    "furthermore , both co and no are known to form adsorbate structures which is more involved@xcite than the simple periodic coverage of 0.25 monolayer considered here and the dependence of non - adiabatic coupling coefficients on coverage certainly deserves a study of its own .    however , from figs .",
    "[ fig : corates ] and [ fig : norates ] we do observe the general trends that no has a much weaker non - adiabatic coupling to the surfaces than co and that for both co and no the coupling to pt and pd are similar whereas the coupling is weaker for rh and very low for ru .",
    "this decrease in non - adiabatic coupling could hint at a simple dependence on the number of d - band electrons . investigating this",
    "will be the subject of future work .",
    "to get an idea of desorption probabilities in the dimet regime we will start by examining how an initial excitation influences the probability of transferring a given number of vibrational quanta . when the oscillator is in an excited vibrational state",
    "there is also the possibility of stimulated emission of vibrational quanta where the incoming hot electron gains energy by the scattering event .    in fig .",
    "[ dimet ] the maximum probability of transferring @xmath81 quanta is shown for a range of initial quantum numbers @xmath63 .",
    "we treat @xmath63 as a continuous variable since in the case of a thermal ensemble of states the initial quantum number is simply replaced by a bose distribution .",
    "there is a striking increase in the probabilities of transferring energy to the oscillator if the oscillator is already excited .",
    "for example , the probabilities of exciting @xmath82 and @xmath83 are @xmath84 and @xmath85 respectively although both transitions involve the same energy transfer .",
    "thus if we compare the one - electron event @xmath86 with the product of the two probabilities @xmath87 we get an order of magnitude difference and we still need to include the other channels for transferring 6 quanta in a two - electron event .",
    "this also implies that the effect of a finite substrate temperature is two - fold : the occupation numbers of excited vibrational states will be non - zero meaning that less energy transfer is needed to desorb the molecule and the likelihood of a given energy transfer is increased if the molecule is thermally excited .",
    "however at room temperature the probability that the internal mode is in its first excited state is on the order of @xmath88 and we can safely neglect the effect of temperature .",
    "vibrational quanta given that the initial state is @xmath63 with @xmath89 . ]",
    "a hallmark of the dimet regime is the power law dependence of the desorption rate on the laser fluence @xmath90 where @xmath63 depends on the particular adsorbate / substrate system considered.@xcite it is by no means trivial that the desorption rate should follow a power law and calculating the exponent of a particular system is a major challenge of any dimet model .",
    "it is reasonable to that assume that the laser fluence is proportional to the flux of hot electrons hitting the molecule , since the desorption rate typically becomes linear@xcite for small fluences corresponding to the diet regime . as a simple model for the desorption rate",
    "we then consider a given flux @xmath91 of hot electrons at a fixed energy @xmath42 hitting the resonance in equally spaced time intervals @xmath92 .",
    "we assume that each vibrational quantum has a fixed lifetime @xmath93 and that desorption occurs immediately if the vibrational energy reaches the desorption energy @xmath94 .",
    "the probability that one vibrational quantum survives the time interval @xmath95 is @xmath96 and the probability of decay is @xmath97 .",
    "the probability that the first electron excites the @xmath63th vibrational state is then simply the diet probability @xmath98 where @xmath99 is given by eq . .",
    "the probability of the adsorbate being in the @xmath63th vibrational state after the second electron has scattered is @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the probability of the transition @xmath102 ( eq . ) and @xmath103 is the probability that the adsorbate was initially in the state @xmath104 given by @xmath105 thus we only sum over values of @xmath106 below the desorption energy since states above @xmath94 would previously have been desorbed by assumption .",
    "similarly the probability @xmath107 of being in the @xmath63th excited state after the third scattering event can be expressed in terms of @xmath108 and so forth .",
    "the desorption probability of the @xmath109th electron is then @xmath110 when enough time intervals is included the probabilities converge such that @xmath111 and the desorption rate is @xmath112 with @xmath113 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dimet_rate ] we show the rate for no on pt(111 ) with @xmath114 .",
    "the desorption energy corresponds to 8 vibrational quanta . note that changing the lifetime @xmath93 in this model just corresponds to rescaling the flux .",
    "the similarity to similar experimental figures@xcite is striking . at small flux",
    "the rate is linear whereas it obeys a power law ( @xmath115 with @xmath116 ) at higher fluences .",
    "the fit to a power law is very good for fluxes above @xmath117 . for small values of the detuning ( @xmath118 ) we find that @xmath119 in good agreement with ho@xcite .",
    "for large positive values of the detuning the exponent decreases dramatically which is probably due the fact that fewer transitions dominate the dynamics in this region .",
    "this means that even though the results was obtained using the simple electron flux @xmath120 we would most likely obtain the same exponent if we generalized the model to any flux localized within @xmath121 of the resonance .",
    "although the correspondence with the experimentally found exponent may be fortuitous in such a simple model the power law itself is very robust to changes in the parameters and we obtain similar power laws for co on pt(111 ) .",
    "for example , changing the value of @xmath41 results in an overall shift of the rates but the exponents are essentially unchanged .",
    "indeed the exponents appear to be determined mainly by the number of vibrational quanta needed for desorption .     with @xmath116 ) corresponding to the dimet regime . in this figure",
    "we show the desorption rate of no on pt(111 ) using the parameters given in table [ tab : desorption2 ] and 7 different values of detuning . ]",
    "we have previously presented a method to obtain excited state potential energy surfaces for molecules chemisorbed at metal surfaces.@xcite in this paper the method have been applied and combined with a non - adiabatic quantum model to obtain desorption probabilities for co and no on four transition metal surfaces .",
    "the model we have applied allow us to predict the probability that a hot electron will transfer a given amount of energy to the different vibrational modes of an adsorbate . our main conclusion is the significant role of the internal degree of freedom and the failure of classical mechanics to describe the excited state adsorbate propagation .",
    "combining the model with a simple picture of the decay and re - excitation of vibrational states reproduces the characteristic power laws of dimet experiments and yields the exponent associated with a given adsorbate / substrate system .",
    "the model we have used for calculating the energy transfer rates obviously represents a very simplified view of the dynamics .",
    "first of all it is a model of non - interacting electrons .",
    "we assume that we can include the important part of the electron - electron interactions by using non - adiabatic coupling coefficients @xmath52 obtained from the interacting density with linear expansion @xmath0scf - dft .",
    "the approximation amounts to assuming ballistic hot electrons and instantaneous restructuring of the electronic environment when occupying the resonance .",
    "although this may be the case in some metallic systems electron - electron interactions could have effects which go beyond a simple renormalization of the non - adiabatic coupling .",
    "the linear non - adiabatic coupling regime leading to eq . corresponds to an assumption of equal curvature on the ground and excited state pes .",
    "this is a good approximation for co but no has a very shallow excited state pes on some of the transition metals and there the approximation may not be as good .",
    "furthermore the model assumes that the ground state potential is quadratic and that the excited state potential is simply a shifted ground state potential . at least in the com direction",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : pes ] that the ground state potential deviates significantly from a quadratic potential and since we are concerned with high lying vibrational excitations this deviation could perhaps have an important effect .",
    "it may be possible to include anharmonic terms in the hamiltonian and calculate new scattering amplitudes perturbatively but the this will be left for future work .",
    "we have focused on the molecules co and no , since they have a conceptually simple structure and a vast amount of experiments have been performed on these systems .",
    "however , it is well known that gga - dft calculations of co adsorbed an pt(111 ) predicts co to bind at a hollow site in contradiction to the experimentally observed top site@xcite . while the difference in adsorbtion energy appears to be less with ` gpaw ` than in the calculations presented in ref .  , possibly due to the use of the paw method instead of ultrasoft pseudopotentials , the difference is still 80 mev and the inability to predict the correct binding site is worrying . on the other hand ,",
    "the existence in the calculation of another adsorption site with a slightly lower energy is unlikely to change the local shape of the potential energy surface enough to _ qualitatively _ change the results obtained here .",
    "in addition , we see a very similar behavior for co on ru(0001 ) , where dft does predict the right adsorption site ( the top site ) . we have thus chosen to put co at the experimentally observed top site as the hollow site would lead to a smaller surface molecule distance and thus very different screening and desorption rate .",
    "as previously mentioned the value of @xmath41 is estimated from the kohn - sham projected density of states , but we do not know how well this estimate matches the true value and as such we have mostly treated @xmath41 as a free parameter . in fact the object of interest in the problem is the spectral function of the resonant state , but even if we had a reliable way of determining this function we would have to make the wide band approximation ( where the spectral function is a lorentzian of width @xmath41 ) in order to calculate scattering rates",
    ". nevertheless it would be very interesting to calculate this function to get an idea of the validity of the wide band approximation and to obtain a trustworthy value of @xmath41 .",
    "we have not made any attempt to predict how the distribution of energy evolves after a molecule returns to its electronic ground state , but assume that the dissipation of energy is slow enough that the adsorbate will desorb if the desorption energy has been transferred .",
    "this is of course a rather crude assumption and the rate of energy transfer should be accompanied by a detailed molecular propagation on the full dimensional ground state pes to improve the results .",
    "ground state molecular dynamics would also be necessary to obtain branching ratios when there is a possibility of different chemical reactions induced by hot electrons .",
    "however the model we have presented captures some of the essential features of non - adiabatic dynamics .",
    "for example the appearance of an effective inelastic resonance which is detuned from the electronic resonance by an amount depending on the energy transfer is a pure non - adiabatic result and would never have emerged from an adiabatic model .",
    "furthermore the exponents in the dimet power laws appear to be determined by the number of vibrational quanta needed for desorption and thus communicates the quantum nature of the dynamics .",
    "the projector augmented wave ( paw ) method@xcite utilizes that one can transform single - particle wavefunctions @xmath122 oscillating wildly near the atom core ( all - electron wavefunctions ) , into smooth well - behaved wavefunctions @xmath123 ( pseudo wavefunctions ) which are identical to the all - electron wavefunctions outside some augmentation sphere .",
    "the idea is to expand the pseudo wavefunction inside the augmentation sphere on a basis of smooth continuations @xmath124 of partial waves @xmath125 centered on atom @xmath126 .",
    "the transformation is @xmath127 inside the augmentation sphere @xmath126 fulfills @xmath128    the method of linear expansion @xmath0scf involves expanding a molecular orbital @xmath129 in kohn - sham states @xmath122 and do a self consistent calculation with an additional density corresponding to the orbital.@xcite .",
    "the simplest way of getting the expansion coefficients is using the projector overlaps @xmath130 which is calculated in each iteration anyway .",
    "however , this method turns out to be too inaccurate in the case of co on pt(111 ) due to non - vanishing projector overlaps for highly energetic kohn - sham states as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdos ] .",
    "this implies that the expansion coefficients depend on the number of unoccupied bands included in the calculation     orbitals using the methods of projector / pseudo wavefunction overlap and all - electron wavefunction overlap are compared . in the projector overlap method",
    "the orbital is defined by @xmath131 which is the orbital most similar to the gas - phase calculation .",
    "the long high energy tail of the projector overlap signals an inaccuracy of the method and makes excited state calculations dependent on the number of unoccupied bands .",
    "thus we use the all - electron overlaps to determine expansion coefficients in this work . ]    to calculate the overlaps @xmath132 exactly , one should start by performing a gas - phase calculation of the molecule or atom which is to be used in the @xmath0scf calculation .",
    "the pseudo wavefunction @xmath133 corresponding to the orbital to be occupied is then saved along with the projector overlaps @xmath134 and the @xmath0scf calculation is initialized . in each step of the calculation",
    "we can then do a numerical integration to obtain the expansion coefficients by @xmath135 where was used .",
    "note that there is only a single sum over atoms ( and only the ones in the molecule ) and that the cross terms of pseudo / all - electron wavefunction does not contribute .",
    "this can be seen using the arguments following eq . 20 in ref . .",
    "here we briefly summarize the calculation leading to the inelastic scattering probabilities in the model .@xcite an explicit expression for the probability has previously been obtained@xcite for a single mode at initially in the ground state . here",
    "we will extend the result to an explicit expression for any number of modes initially in a thermal ensemble of vibrationally excited states .    from the hamiltonian",
    "the differential reflection matrix @xmath136 which is defined as the probability per unit final state energy that an incoming hot electron with energy @xmath42 scatters on the resonance into a final state of @xmath43 , can be expressed in terms of a four point green function .",
    "the inelastic part is contained in the expression :      where the green functions is @xmath138 and @xmath139 denotes a thermal ensemble of oscillator states .",
    "the expression is valid for any non - adiabatic coupling function @xmath140 , but in general it can be very hard to obtain an expression for the green function . an exception is the wide band limit with linear coupling corresponding to the hamiltonian .@xcite the green function then becomes @xmath141\\bigg),\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is center of the resonance , @xmath142 is the bose distribution , @xmath143 = @xmath144 is the effective coupling constant of the mode @xmath145 , and @xmath146 the integrals in the scattering matrix can be evaluated by writing the exponentials in as taylor expansions and performing the @xmath147 integral .",
    "this leaves the remaining two integrals as complex conjugates which are evaluated by writing factors such as @xmath148 by their binomial expansions . for a single oscillator with thermal occupation",
    "@xmath63 we obtain the inelastic reflection matrix : @xmath149 with @xmath150 although the expression looks rather complicated it has a simple interpretation .",
    "integrating over final state energies in the vicinity of @xmath151 gives the probability of transferring @xmath152 to the oscillator if the energy of the incoming electron is @xmath42 : @xmath153 where the first term is the probability of adding @xmath81 bosons , the second term is the probability for removing ( coupling @xmath154 ) one and adding ( coupling @xmath155 ) @xmath156 bosons and so forth .",
    "we can also evaluate the differential reflection matrix for @xmath109 oscillators initially in the ground state with frequencies and coupling constants @xmath70 and @xmath143 respectively .",
    "the result is @xmath157 it is amusing that the result for a one mode system with initial excitation number @xmath63 follows from the result if we regard as a two - mode system at @xmath158 with energies @xmath159 and @xmath160 and coupling constants @xmath161 and @xmath162 respectively . for convenience we state the probability of exciting the @xmath163 state from the ground state in the two - dimensional model with modes @xmath164 and @xmath165 @xmath166",
    "the elastic part of the scattering matrix for a single oscillator with thermal occupation number @xmath63 is @xmath167 we can use the linked cluster theorem to derive the retarded green function and get the result @xmath168 we can then calculate the elastic part of the scattering probability and get @xmath169\\hbar\\omega)^2+(\\gamma/2)^2}.\\ ] ]      the @xmath63 in the expressions above denote the bose distribution and not a specific state @xmath171 , but in the context of dimet our main point of interest is the probability that a oscillator initially in the state @xmath172 scatters inelastically to the state @xmath173 .",
    "however , the expression in the case of a pure state is very similar to the thermal ensemble , the only difference being that we should make the substitution @xmath174 in , where @xmath175 is the @xmath63th laguerre polynomial .",
    "the expression involving laguerre polynomials is somewhat more complicated to handle numerically and therefore we have chosen to work with the thermal ensemble expressions instead . in the range of parameters in the present work",
    "the thermal ensemble expressions are very good approximations since @xmath175 have the same first order taylor expansion as @xmath176 and for @xmath177 we get @xmath178 .",
    "we would like to acknowledge the help and advise of jens jrgen mortensen on implementing and using linear expansion @xmath0scf in gpaw .",
