    "flexible synthetic polymers have long been of fundamental scientific interest because many of their properties arise from a few universal features like the topological connectivity , random - walk like structure , and excluded volume of the chain molecules .",
    "less universal are the various attractive , `` associative '' intermolecular interactions @xcite ranging from weak dispersion forces to strong covalent chemical bonds ( in chemically crosslinked systems ) .",
    "examples include hydrogen bonding , electrostatic attractions , and effective attractions driven by incompatibility with a solvent .",
    "these interactions lead to formation of supramolecular structures ranging from micelles to network gels .",
    "associating polymers ( aps ) differ from simple homopolymers in that chains contain a ( typically fairly low ) fraction of `` sticky '' monomers , which are different from the majority - species monomers .",
    "the sticky monomers form `` sticky bonds '' with each other via associative interactions weaker than permanent covalent bonds .",
    "these lead to formation of supramolecular aggregrates .",
    "unlike the closely related `` living '' or `` equilibrium '' polymers , the degree of polymerization of ap `` parent '' chains is fixed ( in time ) by permanent covalent backbone bonds .",
    "the lifetime of the sticky bonds is finite .",
    "depending on the nature of the associative interactions and ambient conditions ( e.  g.  temperature , concentration ) , the supramolecular topology may be practically permanent , in which case the system forms a `` chemical gel '' ( i.  e.  a crosslinked rubber ) , or so short - lived that the system is indistinguishable from a simple polymer solution , melt or glass . between these limits , when the topology of the associated supramolecular aggregates changes on a time scale comparable to the experiment , these systems form complex fluids with fascinating dynamical and mechanical properties @xcite .    at fixed ambient conditions ,",
    "the time scales for topological changes in associating polymer systems are in principle set by three independent factors : the ( a ) thermodynamics ( i.  e.  energetic strength relative to @xmath0 ) , ( b ) the `` chemical kinetics '' of the sticky bonds , and ( c ) the underlying non - associative polymer physics .",
    "thermodynamics set `` static '' quantities such as the size of the supramolecular aggregates and hence the position of the system relative to the percolative gelation transition .",
    "kinetics set relaxation times through their effect on the rates of formation and breaking of sticky bonds . polymer physics alters the dynamics through such effects as the random - walk - like structure and uncrossability of chains , which give rise to the systems underlying rouse or reptation dynamics @xcite .",
    "the interplay of ( a)-(c ) allows for the design of materials with exquisitely tunable rheological response . for this reason ,",
    "aps have been the focus of intense experimental and theoretical study over the past two decades ; see refs .",
    "@xcite for reviews .",
    "changes in ambient conditions lead to `` thermoreversible '' property changes unique to ap systems , e.  g.  extremely sharply decreasing viscosity upon decreasing concentration or increasing temperature . these changes can be tuned ( engineered ) , so aps have great potential as `` smart '' materials @xcite in which the change of lifetime or concentration of the sticky bonds with ambient conditions leads to useful products .",
    "applications include temperature - sensitive adhesives , coatings for heat - sensitive materials , and generally enhanced melt processability relative to conventional polymers @xcite .",
    "static thermodynamic properties of ap systems , in particular the percolative gelation transition and local structural changes arising from associative interactions , have been extensively studied .",
    "analytic theories provide a good understanding of homogenous systems , and emerging numerical techniques such as self consistent field theoretic simulations @xcite and reaction - ensemble dpd @xcite show promise for investigating inhomogeneous systems .    however , the dynamical , mechanical , and nonequilibrium properties of associating polymer gels and networks remain poorly understood .",
    "time dependent properties obviously depend on kinetics , and in addition to being of fundamental scientific interest , a better understanding of them may prove important in developing new applications of associating polymer systems such as self healing materials @xcite .",
    "the situation becomes particularly complex when the lifetime of the sticky bonds is not long or short compared to the `` polymeric '' relaxation times ; this regime has been studied rather extensively for linear equilibrium polymers ( see e.  g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ) , but much less so for networks .",
    "analytic and quasi - analytic approaches to ap dynamics and mechanics , e.  g.  @xcite refs .",
    "@xcite , have made many useful , experimentally verifiable predictions , including nonlinear behaviors such as shear thickening and strain hardening @xcite . in the general case , however , the complex interplay of sticky bond thermodynamics and kinetics with the underlying polymer physics in these systems is almost certainly beyond the reach of analytic theory . for the sake of tractability",
    ", theories have generally neglected one or more features of ap systems that are likely essential to capturing their behavior under certain ambient conditions .",
    "for example , as temperature drops towards the glass transition , attractive , non - associative interactions , such as van der waals forces between non - sticky monomers , become increasingly important @xcite . moreover , virtually all analytic treatments have thus far been restricted @xcite to homogeneous ap systems ; the majority focus on the `` telechelic '' case of aps with only 2 sticky monomers per parent chain ( one on each end ) .",
    "we believe that inhomogeneous ap systems are the potentially the most interesting and useful , e.  g.  because inhomogeneities serve to localize sticky monomer concentration and network connectivity , which in turn can broaden the relaxation spectrum @xcite .",
    "the above set of potentially essential features of aps is not treated microscopically by existing theories , but can be readily captured by particle - based simulations .",
    "this is the first of a series of simulation studies , the goal of which is to elucidate the separate effects of sticky bond thermodynamics , kinetics , and other underlying polymer physics on the dynamical , mechanical , and nonequilibrium properties of associating polymers .",
    "previous particle based simulations of ap networks focusing on dynamical properties , e.  g.  @xcite refs .",
    "@xcite have produced a wealth of interesting ideas and results .",
    "however , for various reasons outlined in section [ subsec : compareprevmethods ] , the methods employed in these previous studies are not suitable for the full range of problems we wish to consider .",
    "a more versatile model for aps requires the combination of : * i ) * realistic dynamics , * ii ) * applicability to far - from - equilibrium conditions , * iii ) * controllable sticky binding topology , * iv ) * variable chemical kinetics and * v ) * the ability to treat inhomogeneous systems .    in this paper",
    "we develop and validate a model , based on those employed in refs .",
    "@xcite , that shows all these characteristics .",
    "much of the physics of amorphous polymer melts and gels is independent of chemical detail @xcite , so properties i ) and ii ) are captured by using a bead - spring model @xcite for the underlying ( non - associative ) polymer physics .",
    "we capture properties ( iii)-(v ) by employing a hybrid molecular dynamics / monte carlo ( md / mc ) approach with controlled ( specifically , binary ) bonding and variable chemical kinetics @xcite .",
    "the combination of properties ( i - v ) allows the model to be used to obtain many results unattainable with previous methods .",
    "a key advance is that our algorithm is parallelizable . in validating and investigating our model ,",
    "we separate the effects of thermodynamics , kinetics , and polymer physics on ap network dynamics and mechanics .",
    "we show that sticky bonding is mappable to a `` mean - field '' two - state arrhenius rate model , but that the kinetic rate constants for sb association and dissociation are affected by the fact that the sms are embedded in polymers .",
    "one of the key aspects of associating polymer networks , which has rarely been examined ( for _ networks _ ) in the theoretical or simulation literature , is that sticky bond relaxation can be either kinetically limited ( i.  e. limited by the intrinsic rate of bonding and/or debonding ) or diffusion limited ( i. e. when the kinetics are so fast that sticky bond scission and recombination events become correlated because newly broken sm pairs tend to recombine before exploring the network cage ) .",
    "most experimental systems seem to be kinetically limited , and this is the case treated by almost all published analytic theories for reversibly associating networks , including transient network models @xcite .",
    "theories for kinetically limited ap networks @xcite assume that the sticky bond lifetime @xmath1 is so long compared to all `` polymeric '' relaxation times that it controls all important time scales for network relaxation , and therefore that kinetics only affect key network relaxation times through their effect on @xmath1 ( or , alternately , as suggested by recent experiments @xcite , the inverse dissociation rate constant @xmath2 , defined below ) .",
    "we show that the validity of this assumpton is questionable , and that there is a wide parameter space , plausibly accessible in experiments , where it is invalid .",
    "note that published theories @xcite for diffusion - limited reactions in polymeric systems , such as those of oshaughnessy _ et .",
    "_ , either are not immdeiately applicable or have not yet been applied to reversible networks .",
    "our simulations explore the crossover between the kinetically limited and the diffusion limited cases .",
    "we confirm a key prediction of rubinstein and semenov @xcite on the role of bond recombination on ap dynamics , specifically that recombination effectively renormalizes the sb lifetime in systems where the sticky bonds are sufficiently strong .",
    "however , we show that recombination couples interestingly to the diffusive - kinetic crossover in a way not previously predicted .",
    "we extensively examine the dynamics in quiescent , equilibrium systems .",
    "one of the more interesting results is that slowing chemical kinetics increases dynamical heterogeneity @xcite in a manner similar to increasing the thermodynamic strength of the sticky bonds .",
    "we also examine nonequilibrium ` chemical dynamics ' ( i.  e.  in systems where the initial sticky bond population is not equilibrated ) , and nonlinear mechanical properties . the studies of nonequilibrium systems and mechanical properties presented here are limited in number because this paper is intended primarily to illustrate the broad utility of the model .",
    "the organization of the rest of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : modelmethods ]",
    "we further motivate , describe and extensively validate our model .",
    "we also discuss how it differs from those used in previous simulations of aps . in section",
    "[ sec : results ] we present various results for the equilibrium and nonequilibrium physics of thermoreversible ap networks , and compare to theoretical predictions .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclude ] presents a discussion and conclusions .",
    "two appendices include technical details of the analyses .",
    "of particular interest for the current study , and motivating our modelling approach , are recent experiments performed by the group of stephen l.  craig @xcite .",
    "these have attempted to _ independently _ vary thermodynamics and chemical kinetics by making systematic changes in sticky monomer chemistry ( based on metal - ligand interactions ) .",
    "systems with similar static properties show dramatic differences in time - dependent properties that are directly associated with the different kinetics .",
    "this effect is quite challenging to capture experimentally because thermodynamics and kinetics are highly correlated for most ap systems ( i.  e.  stronger binding @xmath3 slower kinetics @xcite ) , but relatively easy to impose in simulations .",
    "the advantages of including variable kinetics in the model are rather obvious given the above discussion .",
    "the advantage of imposing binary bonding ( i.  e.  a sm is at all times bonded to either 0 or 1 other sm ) is also relevance to current experiments .",
    "sticky monomers with binary bonding are considered particularly valuable for making thermoplastic elastomers with enhanced melt processability and controllable network architecture @xcite .",
    "real examples include multiple hydrogen bonding monomers such as ureidopyrimidinone ( upy ) , which have highly directional associative interactions , and are of a strength such that the sticky bonds they form constitute a `` reversible alternative for the covalent bond '' @xcite . in the model used here @xcite ,",
    "sticky bonds differ from covalent bonds only by their reversibility and strength .",
    "our model is built on the framework of the kremer - grest bead - spring model @xcite , which has been extensively validated and is known to capture the key physics of linear homopolymer melts @xcite as well as permanently crosslinked networks @xcite .",
    "each associating polymer chain is linear and contains @xmath4 beads ( monomers ) .",
    "systems consist of @xmath5 chains , so the total number of monomers is @xmath6 .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are imposed in all three directions , with periods @xmath7 along directions @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "values of @xmath5 range from 700 to 5600 ; the lowest values are chosen to satisfy @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is the mean chain end - end distance ) , preventing self interactions .",
    "remaining leading order finite size effects in networks scale as @xmath13 @xcite and should be @xmath14 for the systems considered here .",
    "all monomers have mass @xmath15 and interact via the truncated and shifted lennard - jones ( lj ) potential @xmath16 $ ] , where @xmath17 is the cutoff radius and @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "covalent bonds between adjacent monomers on a chain are modeled using the finitely extensible nonlinear elastic potential @xmath20 , with the canonical @xcite parameter choices @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in this study , following the majority of bead - spring studies on permanently crosslinked systems ( e.  g.  refs .",
    "@xcite ) , we employ flexible chains with no angular potential .",
    "we express all quantities in units of the lj bead diameter @xmath23 , intermonomer energy @xmath24 , and the lj time @xmath25 .",
    "all systems have monomer density @xmath26 .",
    "we employ two temperatures in this study : @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "these ambient conditions both correspond to dense polymer melts far above the glass transition temperature @xmath29 ; @xmath30 for @xmath31 and decreases with decreasing @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "this far above @xmath29 , melt physics is known to be dominated by the repulsive part of the intermonomer interactions @xcite ; for convenience , and following convention @xcite , we use purely repulsive lj interactions with @xmath33 . however ,",
    "including attractive interactions by increasing @xmath32 is trivial , is important to realistically capture @xmath34 dependent properties , and will be done in upcoming studies .",
    "all simulations are performed using an enhanced version of the lammps @xcite md code .",
    "newton s equations of motion are integrated with md using the velocity verlet method @xcite and typical timestep @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "a langevin thermostat @xcite is used to maintain the temperature .",
    "the damping time @xmath36 is larger than the value typically used ( @xmath37 ) in bead spring studies ; this reduces undesirable thermostat - driven effects such as alteration of stress relaxation by suppression of hydrodynamic momentum transfer @xcite . in this study",
    "we employ two `` chain lengths '' .",
    "most studies are performed at @xmath38 , which is at or below best estimates of the entanglement length @xmath39 @xcite , so the melts can be fully equilibrated by allowing chains to diffuse several @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "@xmath38 is also a convenient choice of chain length because it has been considered in many previous studies . to elucidate the effects of underlying polymeric structure on ap physics",
    ", we also consider monomeric melts ( @xmath40 ) , that reversibly sticky - bond into dimers .",
    "after the melts are equilibrated , we choose a fraction @xmath41 of the monomers to be `` sticky '' . for the @xmath40 systems",
    "these are chosen randomly . for @xmath42 systems ,",
    "sms are placed uniformly along chains : at both chain ends and also at internal monomers @xmath43 , where @xmath44 . in this study",
    "we use @xmath45 ( which is comparable to typical experimental values , e.  g.  @xcite , so for @xmath38 the sms are the 1st , 17th , 34th , and 50th monomers in each chain . however , any sm placement can be used , and studies of the effects of altering sm placement at fixed @xmath41 are underway ; the effects of chemical disorder are known to be significant for stress relaxation @xcite .",
    "sticky monomers are identical to regular monomers , except that they form reversible `` sticky '' bonds .",
    "figure [ fig : smpotential ] illustrates the potential energy between sticky monomers as a function of their separation @xmath46 .",
    "sms ( like all monomers ) always interact via lennard jones interactions , whether bonded or not . bonded",
    "sms additionally interact via the potential @xmath47 : @xmath48 which is based on the standard covalent fene potential . here",
    "@xmath49 represents the equilibrium fene bond length ; @xmath50 , i.  e.  the minimum of the potential @xmath51 .",
    "the only difference between the sticky and covalent bond potentials is thus an @xmath46-independent , tunable offset .",
    "the same bonding potential was used in huang _ et .",
    "_ s studies of equilibrium polymers @xcite and a very similar potential was used in baljon _ et .",
    "al.s_ studies of telechelic associating networks @xcite .",
    "however , our method has several important differences from those of refs .",
    "@xcite ( see section [ subsec : compareprevmethods ] ) , so we explain it in detail below .",
    "the potential @xmath52 has several other important features .",
    "@xmath53 represents the sticky binding energy ; for @xmath54 a sticky bond can be formed between two monomers separated by @xmath49 with no change in energy .",
    "the associated force @xmath55 , however , is independent of @xmath53 .",
    "adjusting @xmath53 is thus a nearly pure way of adjusting the thermodynamics of the sticky bonds without directly altering their `` chemical kinetics '' , i.  e.  the rates of formation and dissociation of sticky bonds .",
    "formation and breaking of sticky bonds is performed using metropolis monte carlo @xcite .",
    "the change in energy required to form a sticky bond between an unbonded pair of sms is just @xmath56 , and the energy change to break a sticky bond is @xmath57 .",
    "these are the only mc `` moves '' used , and the acceptance probability of the moves is set by @xmath58 .",
    "the mc moves are strictly `` topological '' .",
    "all spatial motion of bonded sms is governed by the sticky bond force @xmath59 , along with the other forces from lennard jones and covalent fene interactions , which are all integrated using md .",
    "one potential difficulty is that only bonded sms `` feel '' the force @xmath59 , so formation / breaking of sms creates temporal force discontinuities . however , as will be shown below , this does not seem to cause any spurious behavior .",
    "the system sizes and time scales studied here require simulation on parallel computers ; 8 to 64 processors are used in a typical simulation . while md parallelizes very well",
    "@xcite , it has long been noted that mc @xcite is very difficult to parallelize .",
    "we therefore perform hybrid parallel md / serial mc simulations .",
    "mc moves are performed once every @xmath60 in lennard jones time units ; @xmath60 is the mc `` timestep '' .",
    "the md simulation is paused while the parallel - distributed lists of sticky bonds and sm coordinates are gathered onto one processor . for efficiency ,",
    "verlet - style pair neighbor lists of sms are used and of open sm pairs , only those within @xmath61 are considered for sb formation . after the sb list is updated , it is distributed back to all processors and the md simulation resumes .",
    "great care was taken to optimize the mc algorithm to minimize `` dead '' time on the other processors , but reasonable parallel performance requires @xmath62 . in this paper , except where otherwise noted , we use @xmath63 ; see also section [ subsec : twostatedynamics ] .",
    "as mentioned above , current experimental trends favor binary - bonding sticky monomers , we impose binary bonding through a simple restriction on the monte carlo routine ; sticky bond formation is attempted only for pairs of unbonded sms .",
    "the 1 - 1 bonding restriction imposed here was also assumed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which eases comparison of our results to theoretical predictions .",
    "two further technical details of the mc algorithm are noteworthy : ( 1 ) we do not allow any sm pair to both break and form a sb ( i.  e. , to break and recombine ) during the same mc step .",
    "this is a technical violation of detailed balance , but satisfies the weaker `` balance '' condition sufficient @xcite for accurate mc simulations .",
    "sb recombination is a critical aspect of supramolecular polymer physics @xcite and is further discussed in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "( 2 ) we do not allow `` bond switching '' moves within a single mc step . that is , for sms @xmath64 , we do not allow moves of the form @xmath65 or any other more complicated moves .",
    "in addition to being difficult to implement in simulations , such processes are unlikely to occur instantaneously in real systems , in part because of steric constraints .",
    "different but analogous rules , suitably modified to the use of sms with two binding sites each , were imposed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in our model",
    ", varying the relative rates of sticky bond formation and dissociation is accomplished by varying @xmath53 . however , the absolute values of the rates depend on a yet unspecified _ kinetic _ time scale @xmath66",
    ". this time can be controlled through the monte carlo routine . at each mc timestep ( i.  e. , every @xmath60 ) , a fraction @xmath67 of unbonded sm pairs ( of those within range @xmath61 ) and an equal fraction @xmath67 of bonded sm pairs",
    "are randomly selected to be considered respectively for sticky bond formation and breaking .",
    "we have verified this scheme maintains ` balance ' @xcite for pairs and triplets of sms for @xmath68 .",
    "thus the average time over which each unbonded or bonded sm pair is considered once for ( respectively ) sb formation or breaking is @xmath69 , and the parameter @xmath70 effectively controls the `` chemical kinetics '' of the sbs . for a discussion of why we use @xmath71 rather than varying @xmath72 , see section [ subsec : twostatedynamics ] .",
    "small @xmath70 correspond to fast chemical kinetics @xcite , while large @xmath70 correspond to slow chemical kinetics .    in section [ subsec : nonlinmechprop ]",
    "we perform mechanical tests on various systems .",
    "two types of tests are perfomed ; constant volume deformation and tensile creep . in the constant volume deformation tests ,",
    "@xmath73 is increased at a true strain rate @xmath74 , and @xmath75 and @xmath76 are adjusted to maintain constant volume . in the creep tests , a constant ( small ) stress difference @xmath77 ( relative to the equilibrium hydrostatic pressure in the quiescent state , which is positive for repulsive lj interactions ) is applied along the @xmath10 direction using a nose hoover barostat @xcite .",
    "this smaller @xmath78 produces tensile creep .",
    "both types of tests use @xmath79 to minimize systematic errors .",
    "it is worthwhile to compare the simulation method and ambient conditions described above in the context of previous ap simulation studies .",
    "the use of a hybrid md / mc method is a powerful advantage .",
    "pure monte carlo ( mc ) simulations have been performed with lattice @xcite and off - lattice @xcite models .",
    "these are very effective at studying static properties like percolative gelation and ( in the case of solutions ) phase separation , but have limited ability to capture the complex , collective dynamics which occur in bulk polymers , and thus lack properties ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "for example , mc can not , even in principle @xcite , capture hydrodynamic effects , which are expected to play an important role whenever momentum transfer is important ( e. g. in relaxation of highly stressed systems ) .",
    "pure molecular dynamics ( md ) studies @xcite have been used to study static and dynamic properties . while better able to capture dynamics and nonequilibrium phenomena than mc",
    ", md studies can not naturally implement controllable sticky bonding topology .",
    "also , md studies can not easily impose any control of chemical kinetics without resorting to costly , chemically realistic models .",
    "for example , padding and boek @xcite studied systems intermediate between ours and those studied by huang _ et .",
    "; a fraction @xmath80 of their monomers were allowed to form linear equilibrium poiymers , but the fene - c sticky bonding potential @xcite used did not allow for variable kinetics .",
    "thus , in practice , typical md studies lack properties ( iii ) and ( iv ) .    the previous works most closely related to the present method are refs .",
    "@xcite , who also used hybrid mc / md with the same @xmath52 ( eq .  [ eq : usticky ] ) .",
    "@xcite also used variable kinetics , but studied equilbrium linear polymers with @xmath81 rather than network - forming aps with @xmath82 .",
    "details of the huang _ et .",
    "_ method are discussed extensively in ref .",
    "the key differences of our method from ref .",
    "@xcite are the imposition of binary bonding and the use of variable @xmath70 ( they used only one @xmath83 ) .",
    "another difference was that refs .",
    "@xcite all used a much stronger thermostat , giving overdamped ( brownian ) dynamics .",
    "many previous studies have used nonspecific ( e.  g.  strengthened attractive lennard - jones or coulombic ) interactions which allow sms to form arbitarily many simultaneous sbs @xcite .",
    "this results in formation of interesting structures such as micelles and micelle - bridge networks , which occur in real ap systems such as associating ionomers ( see e.  g.  ref .",
    "in contrast , the ( experimental ) aps we wish to model tend to form networks more like classical rubbers .",
    "most previous studies @xcite varied temperature @xmath34 at fixed sm bonding strength .",
    "this does not isolate the effects of @xmath34 on associative bonding from its other effects such as the dynamical slowdown which occurs in normal ( non - associative ) polymers . to get a full picture of ap physics , one should vary both @xmath53 and @xmath34 independently @xcite .",
    "we follow this approach .",
    "other differences from previous simulation studies are more associated with the systems employed than the methods applied .",
    "many studies have considered only telechelic chains @xcite .",
    "telechelics are appealing in their simplicity , but their network - forming abilities are naturally limited ; for binary bonding , at least 3 sms / chain are required to form good networks .",
    "weakly entangled chains ( @xmath84 ) may be ideal @xcite for technological goals such as enhanced melt processability at high @xmath34 and network strength at low @xmath34 .",
    "the majority of previous studies have employed extremely short @xmath85 chains @xcite , but we consider systems with @xmath84 . finally , the majority of previous studies have focused on small @xmath86 corresponding to solutions @xcite .",
    "ap solutions exhibit a wide range of intriguing phenomena , in particular competition between gelation and phase separation @xcite , which , however , we do not wish to consider here .",
    "in addition , the presence of solvent can dramatically weaken the effective strength of sticky bonds in real systems @xcite ; this effect is beyond the scope of our model .",
    "we therefore focus on systems with @xmath86 corresponding to a dense pure melt with no solvent .",
    "mappings of the bead - spring model to real , dense polymer melts @xcite produce different @xmath87 in the range @xmath88 .",
    "present day computers can achieve runs ( for the system sizes used here ) of up to @xmath89 , but runs this long can not be performed over a broad parameter space .",
    "in contrast , sticky bond lifetimes in experimental systems are typically at least @xmath90 , and often many orders of magnitude longer @xcite . thus any attempt to capture specific sm chemistries and at the same time use systems large enough to study bulk dynamics and mechanical properties would exceed the capabilities of present day supercomputers @xcite .",
    "coarse - grained modelling with the goal of studying the dynamics of ap systems _ by analogy _ is the only currently feasible approach for bulk systems , so we make no attempt to mimic specific chemistries .",
    "the only published simulations of which we are aware that model ap networks with specific chemistries @xcite are pure monte carlo studies that used a very coarse - grained ( lattice ) bond - fluctuation model @xcite and focused on static properties .      as discussed above ,",
    "systems contain a total of @xmath91 sticky monomers . due to the binary bonding rules , the maximum number of sticky bonds that can exist in the system at any given time is @xmath92 . if the probability that an sm is bound into an sb is @xmath93 , then the total number of sbs in the system is @xmath94 .",

    "this is not surprising , as full delocalization should occur only when chains have lost all memory of their initial sb topology ; this `` memory '' time is inherently polymeric in that it must increase with increasing @xmath181 , similarly to a rouse or reptation time @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the peaks of @xmath283 are broader than those of @xmath271 .",

    "similarly , at fixed @xmath53 and @xmath0 , relaxation slows as the chemical kinetics are slowed .",

    "such relations should be of interest because rheological experiments can typically only access @xmath184 , which is assumed to control stress relaxation ( e.  g. , because scission followed by quick recombination does not relax stress ) @xcite .    while the results for @xmath34-variation and mechanical properties presented here were limited and somewhat preliminary , we showed examples which illustrate important effects .",
    "analysis of diffusion on intermediate time scales illustrated the point that sticky bond and underlying polymeric timescales will in general vary differently with @xmath34 , affecting the ` interplay ' in nontrivial ways . in two systems with the same @xmath1 ,",
    "systems with different propensities for sb recombination showed the same creep flow at short times , but those with greater recombination showed a smaller long - time ( `` dc '' ) creep compliance .",
    "these differences were directly related to the faster delocalization of chains in the _ quiescent _ state for systems with less recombination .",
    "constant - volume deformation studies showed that , as expected , @xmath1 is reduced by stress . extensive studies of the variation with @xmath34 ( in systems including attractive nonbond interactions for greater realism ) and more detailed analyses of nonlinear mechanical properties are underway .    nearly all published analytic theories for ap networks assume a single controlling relaxation time , either @xmath1 or @xmath184 , controls the ultimate relaxation properties ( i.  e.  other relaxation times scale with the controlling time ) .",
    "we showed though various measurements that there is a broad parameter space ( both in terms of sb strength and kinetics ) within the physical gel regime where the `` scaling '' assumption fails .",
    "this parameter space corresponds to the conditions ( 1 ) @xmath241 is larger but not `` much larger '' than unity , and/or ( 2 ) sb recombination is not kinetically limited .",
    "deviations from this `` scaling '' behavior due to multiple controlling relaxation times have been observed @xcite , but had not yet been well understood .",
    "these deviations had been previously assumed to arise from chemical disorder , and this is no doubt partially correct , but as discussed in this paper , they also arise from the ` interplay ' between sb thermodynamics , kinetics , and polymer physics . if either ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) hold , both traditional @xcite and more sophisticated @xcite theories should fail to predict the mechanical properties of ap networks .",
    "this is not meant as a criticism of the theories , merely an observation that there is a broad parameter space where one or more of their assumptions fail .",
    "the dl and kl limits have been discussed by oshaughnessy and yu @xcite ; they respectively correspond to dominance of the @xmath255-term and @xmath251-term in our eq .",

    "this suggests that diffusion - limited sb recombination , which increases @xmath241 , will increase in importance in ap systems with effectively reduced dimensionality ( e.  g.  very thin films or `` pores '' ) . combining the approaches of refs .",
    "@xcite may be useful for developing optimal analytic theories of these systems , at least for @xmath34 well above @xmath29 .",
    "however , we are not aware of any quantitative discussion of the crossover between the dl and kl regimes such as presented here @xcite .",
    "the rheologically simple ( i.  e.  all key relaxation times scale with @xmath1 @xcite ) behavior observed in the majority of experiments on ap networks indicates they exhibit kl behavior .",
    "note that these experiments have shown kl behavior even though their values of @xmath98 are comparable to values for systems which in our model exhibit dl behavior at low @xmath70 .",
    "this likely arises from the slow kinetics caused by the bulkiness and directional interactions of real sticky monomers .",
    "creating ( real ) strong - binding sms with even faster kinetics seems to be difficult .",
    "however , one can move out of the kl regime ( at fixed kinetic rates ) simply by slowing the polymeric relaxation times , e.  g.  by going to higher concentrations and/or entangled chains .",
    "experiments in this regime are underway @xcite , and seem to show a breakdown of the simple scaling ; for example , they show an unusually high power law dependence of viscosity on concentration , which appears to arise because @xmath1 is of order the time scale for reptation .",
    "@xcite also shows an apparent ( if weak ) breakdown in scaling at the highest frequencies considered . in the context of these observations ,",
    "we note that the parameter space where ( 1 ) and or ( 2 ) hold may be of greatest interest for designing materials with novel mechanical properties .",
    "our model seems well suited to aid in understanding the complicated behavior of ap networks in this regime .",
    "here we have left the regime of physically entangled aps , which is the regime treated by some key analytic ap theories @xcite , untouched .",

    "studies of systems with a wide range of @xmath4 and @xmath41 , as well as inhomogeneous ( chemically disordered ) systems , are underway .    in real ap networks",
    "the sticky and regular monomers have different sizes and chemistries .",
    "thus an obvious extension of our model would be to increase the differences between the sticky and normal monomers .",
    "for example , changing secondary interactions may induce microphase separation @xcite .",
    "another extension would be use of a more realistic sticky bonding potential such as those used to model h - bonds ( see e.  g.   ref .  @xcite and refs .  therein ) , but here we have focused on chemistry - independent properties . a coarse - grained way to to capture this would be to keep the binary bonding rules , but include more than one sticky site per sm ; this would increase the directionality of bonding , which is a key to the performance of the upy systems @xcite .",
    "finally , nanocomposites of associating polymers @xcite , where the presence of nanoparticles may or may not @xcite affect single - chain structure but will certainly affect ap network structure , should have even richer physics than regular polymer nanocomposites .",
