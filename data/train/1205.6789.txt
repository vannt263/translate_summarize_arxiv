    "<S> the extension of boltzmann - gibbs thermostatistics , proposed by tsallis , introduces an additional parameter @xmath0 to the inverse temperature @xmath1 . here , we show that a previously introduced generalized metropolis dynamics to evolve spin models is not local and does not obey the detailed energy balance . in this dynamics </S>",
    "<S> , locality is only retrieved for @xmath2 , which corresponds to the standard metropolis algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> non - locality implies in very time consuming computer calculations , since the energy of the whole system must be reevaluated , when a single spin is flipped . to circumvent this costly calculation </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a generalized master equation , which gives rise to a local generalized metropolis dynamics that obeys the detailed energy balance . to compare the different critical values obtained with other generalized dynamics , </S>",
    "<S> we perform monte carlo simulations in equilibrium for ising model . by using the short time non - equilibrium numerical simulations </S>",
    "<S> , we also calculate for this model : the critical temperature , the static and dynamical critical exponents as function of @xmath0 . even for @xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> , we show that suitable time evolving power laws can be found for each initial condition . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical experiments corroborate the literature results , when we use non - local dynamics , showing that short time parameter determination works also in this case . </S>",
    "<S> however , the dynamics governed by the new master equation leads to different results for critical temperatures and also the critical exponents affecting universality classes . </S>",
    "<S> we further propose a simple algorithm to optimize modeling the time evolution with a power law considering in a log - log plot two successive refinements . </S>"
