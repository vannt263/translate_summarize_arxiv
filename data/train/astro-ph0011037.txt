    "our planetary system should not be expected to be bounded by the orbit of the ninth planet pluto , as pointed out by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our current general understanding of the formation of our solar system is consistent with the expectation that a large population of small bodies ",
    "leftovers from the primordial planetesimal disk in the solar nebula  exists at the present time beyond the orbits of neptune and pluto where planetary accretion timescales exceed the current age of the solar system .",
    "indirect evidence for such a population ( now known as the _ kuiper belt _ ) exists in the orbital properties of the short period comets , as has been suggested by several authors @xcite .",
    "direct observational evidence was first obtained with the discovery of 1992 qb1 @xcite , and has subsequently grown with the detection of more than 300 objects .",
    "it is notable that all but one of the currently known kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) lie within 55 au of the sun .",
    "the semimajor axis zone @xmath11 au is dynamically a very complex region .",
    "the primordial kuiper belt population here is expected to have been extensively sculpted and depleted throughout solar system history [ see review by @xcite ] .",
    "numerical simulations show that most primordial kbos on orbits with @xmath12  au would have been ejected from the kuiper belt in much less than the age of the solar system @xcite . in the @xmath13 au zone ,",
    "the dynamical lifetime of low eccentricity , low inclination orbits is comparable to the age of the solar system , whereas beyond @xmath14 au the dynamical lifetime is well in excess of the age of the solar system .",
    "the orbital migration of the giant planets in early solar system history is expected to have rearranged the primordial orbital distribution in the @xmath15 au zone , by sweeping a significant fraction of kbos into eccentric orbits at narrow semimajor axis zones at the locations of mean motion resonances with neptune @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there exists a significant `` scattered '' kbo population , in very eccentric orbits with perihelia near @xmath16 au ; these kbos are thought to have been formed in the @xmath17 au zone and been gravitationally scattered during a close encounter with neptune @xcite .",
    "the current estimate of the surface density in the inner kuiper belt is approximately two orders of magnitude less than that expected from a smooth extrapolation of the surface density from the planetary region [ _ cf . _",
    "it is also approximately two orders of magnitude less than that required for the formation of the largest observed kbos within @xmath18  yrs , before perturbations from the giant planets curtailed their growth @xcite .",
    "these arguments suggest severe depletion of the kuiper belt within 50 au .    beyond 50 au ,",
    "the gravitational influence of neptune and the giant planets is insignificant . a higher present - day density of objects , reflective of the primordial surface density of solids in the solar nebula ,",
    "would be expected in this unperturbed distant kuiper belt .",
    "previous surveys have detected no objects beyond 50  au , leading several authors @xcite to suggest that this higher - density outer region is in fact absent , and that the primordial planetesimal disk must have had a cutoff near 50  au .",
    "@xcite calculate the fraction of detected kbos expected to be beyond 50  au ; applying their formula to the number of kbos known today also indicates that there is a deficiency of distant objects .",
    "these conclusions , however , depend quite sensitively upon the exponents of assumed power laws for size and radial distributions of the population .    in this letter",
    "we report the results of a survey for faint kbos covering more than one square degree of the ecliptic .",
    "most of the known kbo population lie at @xmath19  au and have magnitudes @xmath20 . at our limiting magnitudes of @xmath21",
    ", we can detect physically similar objects to a distance of 65  au or greater .",
    "we compare the results of our faint survey with the detected population of similarly sized kbos at smaller distances , and test whether the population density increases beyond 50 au .",
    "this comparison of the population of @xmath22  km objects is independent of any models or assumptions for the size distribution of the kbos in the two regions .",
    "observations were taken using the btc ccd mosaic camera ( wittman _ et al . _",
    "1998 ) at the cerro tololo interamerican observatory on 3 nights in may 1998 and 4 nights in may 1999 .",
    "the btc images 0.25  deg@xmath0 of ( non - contiguous ) sky per exposure .",
    "each field was observed for a series of 20 to 30 eight - minute exposures spread across two consecutive nights .",
    "these images are registered and summed ( with sigma - clipping rejection ) to yield a deep template image of the fixed field .",
    "the template is then subtracted from each individual exposure after applying an algorithm to match the point spread functions , thus efficiently removing all non - moving objects from the images .",
    "these images are first searched for bright slow - moving objects .",
    "then each field s images are summed with displacements to track a potential kbo motion , and the sum image searched for faint objects .",
    "this last step is repeated several thousand times to permit detection of kbos in any bound orbit at distances 3080  au .",
    "the entire search procedure is repeated on another pair of nights six to eight days later .",
    "candidate kbos were confirmed using data taken six to eight days apart .",
    "a detailed description of our processing and detection methods will be published at a later date .",
    "effective areas and limiting magnitudes are determined by inserting several thousand artificial kbos into the raw data at a variety of velocities and positions .",
    "we then search for these using the same methods used to detect real kbos .",
    "the total area subtended by the six search fields is @xmath23  deg@xmath0 , but bright stars , ccd defects , etc .",
    ", limit the _ effective area _ of the search to @xmath24  deg@xmath0 for bright kbos .",
    "the effective search area drops at fainter magnitudes due to noise .",
    "the may 1998 observations used the kron - cousins @xmath25 filter , and we find that the effective area of these three fields of the search is @xmath26 at bright magnitudes , dropping by 50% at @xmath1 to @xmath27 .",
    "the may 1999 observations , using a wide - band @xmath28 filter @xcite , reach 50% completeness for 25.325.9 @xmath25 mag kbos over effective area of @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath28 magnitudes are converted to @xmath25 assuming a kbo color index of @xmath30 .",
    "table  1 lists the fields observed for this survey and the total integration times , limiting magnitudes and effective areas for each .",
    "several times more area is covered than for the largest previously published survey to this depth @xcite .",
    "twenty - three kbos and one centaur were discovered in the survey .",
    "the observing scheme produces a 10-day arc for most of these objects .",
    "orbital parameters and their uncertainties are determined using the software described in @xcite .",
    "although the full orbital parameters are poorly constrained by such a short arc , the distance is determined fairly accurately .",
    "this is because the object s apparent acceleration is due almost entirely to the reflex of the earth s transverse acceleration , and hence the apparent acceleration is inversely proportional to the distance .",
    "note that this technique requires that we _ not _ observe at opposition .",
    "recovery observations have been made for 7 of the objects , and in all cases the refined orbits produce distances consistent with the 10-day estimates .",
    "a few of the objects were detected near the edges of the frame and were outside the field of view for the second ( confirming ) pair of nights .",
    "distances to these objects with only 24-hour arcs are less certain , and dependent upon the assumption that the orbit is bound .",
    "table  2 contains a list of detected objects and their heliocentric distances , and figure  [ dvsa ] plots their size vs.  distance under the assumption of a 4% albedo .",
    "distances beyond 53  au are ruled out for all of these objects .",
    "thus , over @xmath31 , we have zero detections of objects beyond 53 au , even though objects with diameters larger than 160  km would be visible to 65  au over much of the field .    the diameter ( d [ km ] ) of a kuiper belt object can be estimated using the formula for a uniformly scattering sphere @xcite : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the geometric albedo , taken to be @xmath34 following @xcite . @xmath25 and @xmath35 are the heliocentric and geocentric distances in au , which are approximately equal for these large distances ; @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the apparent magnitude of the sun and kbo , respectively ; and @xmath38 is a phase correction , which we ignore for these distant kbos since the phase angle is always small .",
    "a quantitative characterization of the upper limit on large kbos in the 5565  au range is as follows : at 55  au , a magnitude of @xmath39 is sufficient to detect @xmath8  km objects , while at 65  au , the necessary depth is @xmath40 .",
    "the search efficiency is dropping in this magnitude interval , so an exact estimate of the effective search volume would require a model for the intrinsic kbo distance distribution .",
    "an approximation adequate for our purposes is to take the effective area to be that of a @xmath41  km object at the midpoint , 60  au .",
    "this corresponds to a magnitude of @xmath42 , at which the effective search area is @xmath43 .",
    "our upper limit to the surface density of kbos with @xmath8  km at distances @xmath44  au is therefore 5  deg@xmath45 ( 95% cl ) .",
    "we test the hypothesis of inner - belt depletion by comparing the volume density of kbos inside 50  au to that outside 50  au . because we have a faint limiting magnitude and we have determined the distances ( and hence approximate size ) for all our detected objects , we can proceed by constructing samples of objects of similar size in the two distance regimes , _ without any assumption about the kbo size distribution_. the outer region is the @xmath46  au annulus quantified above .    for our inner region ,",
    "we select all kbos with distances in the range 3050  au and diameters greater than 160  km .",
    "most known kbos within 40  au are in mean - motion resonance orbits or have likely been perturbed by a neptune encounter , affecting the surface density in an uncertain manner .",
    "for this reason , we will also compare our results to an inner region of 4050  au .",
    "our survey yields 8 kbos which have a distance between 3050  au and diameter greater than 160  km .",
    "these are all brighter than @xmath47 , although at 50  au a 160  km kbo is only @xmath48 .    denoting the mean volume density of @xmath8  km kbos in the inner and outer regions as @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively ,",
    "we are interested in an upper bound to the density ratio @xmath51 we assume that @xmath52 objects were detected in the inner region over an effective volume @xmath53 , and @xmath54 objects were detected in the effective volume @xmath55 of the outer region . a bayesian analysis with uniform prior on @xmath49 yields the following simple formula for the probability of @xmath56 being above some value : @xmath57 the effective volume for the inner region is simply that subtended by our survey s @xmath31 effective area over the @xmath58  au distance range , since the inner - region kbos are well above our detection threshold .",
    "the effective volume of the outer region is given by the @xmath43 effective area through the 5565  au depth .",
    "the ratio of volumes between the 5565  au sample and the 3050  au sample , @xmath59 , is then 0.49 .",
    "equation  ( [ bayes ] ) then gives @xmath60 at 95% confidence .",
    "if only the 7 kbos in the inner region from 4050  au are considered , then we find @xmath61 ( 95% cl ) .",
    "we can thus assert in a model - independent way that the density of kbos in the 5565  au range is at least  _ lower _ than in the 4050  au range .",
    "we could estimate the inner - region density from other surveys with brighter magnitude limits than ours , though the comparison with our own brighter objects has the advantage of cancelling any dependence on ecliptic latitude or longitude which may be present in the kbo density .",
    "there are very few published wide - area kbo surveys to serve as comparison samples .",
    "* jlc ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* jlt ) are the two largest .",
    "the jlc survey covers 8.3  deg@xmath0 to a limiting magnitude of @xmath62 . at this depth",
    ", kbos must have diameter @xmath63  km , to be visible all the way to 50  au . out of 15 kbos found by jlc",
    ", 12 have distances within 3050  au and @xmath63  km . using jlc s effective areas quoted at @xmath64 and @xmath62 , a rough estimate for",
    "the effective area for all 12 kbos is 6.1  deg@xmath0 .",
    "our survey will detect 200  km objects to a distance of 67  au , if the same @xmath42 limit is used , so we may conservatively take the outer region in this case to be 5567  au across the @xmath43 effective area for @xmath65 .",
    "this then yields a bayesian limit of @xmath66 ( 95% cl ) for the ratio of outer to inner volume densities of @xmath63  km objects .",
    "the jlt survey , with a much brighter limiting magnitude of @xmath67 over 51.5  deg@xmath0 , detects 13 kbos . of these , 12 are between 3050  au , but only 6 are larger than @xmath68  km , the smallest size that can be seen at 50  au in this survey .",
    "these 6 kbos are all inside 45  au , although we will still consider the inner region 3050  au .",
    "objects with @xmath69  km are detectable to 85  au at @xmath65 , so we take the outer region to be 5585  au . using the same procedures as for the jlc survey , we calculate @xmath70 .",
    "we should at some point expect to find objects beyond 55  au since the orbits of the known scattered - disk members will carry them well beyond this point .",
    "the sole known kbo that is likely beyond 55  au ( 1999 dg@xmath71 ) could be a scattered - disk member ; its 1-night arc is insufficient to determine an orbit .",
    "seven objects with @xmath72 were discovered in very deep keck pencil - beam surveys @xcite ; all have motions over arcs of a few hours that are consistent with distances @xmath73  au .",
    "our failure to detect any scattered - disk objects beyond 50  au does not invalidate our argument , since we claim only a _ fair sample _ of the population , not an exhaustive survey .",
    "we can test the fair - sample hypothesis by examining our detected population of @xmath8  km objects ; we claim that this population is complete to about 65  au , and that majority of the population is within 55  au , _ i.e. _ that we are capable of detecting most of the objects anywhere in their orbits .",
    "there should consequently be no bias toward finding objects at perihelion . examining the 9 objects with @xmath8  km in table  2",
    ", we see that 4 are closer to aphelion than perihelion ( 1998 ky@xmath74 , kg@xmath75 , kr@xmath76 , and 1999 kr@xmath77 ) , 1 is nearer perihelion ( 1998 ks@xmath76 ) , and 4 have uncertain @xmath78 ( 1999 ja@xmath79 , jb@xmath79 , jd@xmath79 , and jf@xmath79 ) .",
    "our objects distance distribution is thus qualitatively consistent with an unbiased sampling of their own orbits .",
    "a quantitative comparison ( ks test ) also demonstrates internal consistency . while this is a weak test",
    ", it is one which the full population of known kbos fails miserably ",
    "there is an extremely strong bias toward objects near perihelion .",
    "indeed our 1999 kr@xmath77 is the only known kbo of significant orbital eccentricity ( @xmath80 ) to be discovered near aphelion .",
    "our lack of detections beyond 55  au is consistent with a density beyond 55  au that is at most similar to that within 50  au , and it is likely we have observed an under - density in the outer kuiper belt .",
    "the measurements are not consistent with a large increase in the surface density beyond 50  au .",
    "if planetary perturbations are solely responsible for the structure of the kuiper belt , a dense primordial disk would be expected beyond @xmath10  au where these perturbations are insignificant .",
    "our survey could have detected such a disk but did not .      1",
    ".   kbos in the outer kuiper belt could be fainter than expected , owing to a lower albedo or much redder color or much smaller sizes .",
    "to explain our survey results , this would require a change in the physical properties of kbos beyond 50  au .",
    "2 .   the outer kuiper belt could have been dynamically excited early in the history of the solar system by a stellar encounter @xcite most likely during the sun s residence in its birth cluster @xcite ; by perturbations from large neptune - scattered planetesimals @xcite or by proto - planetary cores @xcite .",
    "such excitation could have increased the orbital inclinations and eccentricities of the objects , lowering the apparent surface density on the sky and possibly decreasing the maximum size of objects through the cessation or reversal of the accretion process .",
    "more extreme excitation could have stripped away the outer kuiper belt .",
    "3 .   the disk is actually present , but dynamically cold @xcite .",
    "it could have escaped our survey by simply not intersecting our fields .",
    "this is entirely possible , if this disk is inclined to the ecliptic plane by as little as 1 .",
    "the invariable plane ( the angular momentum plane of the solar system ) , inclined to the ecliptic by 1.5 , would be a likely candidate for the location of such a cold , dense disk .",
    "our field  g is only 06 from the invariable plane , so the scale height of the cold disk would have to be @xmath81 to have escaped detection .",
    "this implies a very thin , extremely dense disk .",
    "absence of @xmath82 detections in future deep survey fields would eliminate the possibility of a cold disk .",
    "we thank p. guhathakurta for his help in retrieving some of these objects , and the staff on cerro tololo for their excellent support .",
    "p. fischer provided much of the software used to process the btc images .",
