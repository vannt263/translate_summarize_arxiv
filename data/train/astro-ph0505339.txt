    "recent precise observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation @xcite and the large scale structure @xcite have provided deep insights into the origin of the cosmic density fluctuations . in particular , it has become clear that the primordial density fluctuation is almost scale invariant . as a mechanism to generate the scale invariant density fluctuation ,",
    "inflation @xcite is the most prominent candidate .    even with inflation , however , it is not automatic to make the present density fluctuations to be consistent with the observational constraints . in the standard scenario , fluctuation of the inflaton field ,",
    "whose potential energy is responsible for the energy density during the inflation , is generated during the inflation and it becomes the origin of the present density fluctuations . in this case , properties of the present density fluctuations are determined once the inflaton potential is fixed , and we obtain constraints on the individual inflation models .",
    "if there exists some scalar field other than the inflaton , however , the mechanism of generating the cosmic density fluctuations may become more complicated .",
    "in particular , with a scalar field whose mass is much smaller than the expansion rate during the inflation , fluctuation is imprinted in the amplitude of such scalar field , which provides another potential source of the present density fluctuations . in this paper , we consider one of such examples , the curvaton @xcite.there is another mechanism producing the primordial fluctuation such as inhomogeneous reheating or modulated reheating @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we do not consider this possibility . in the curvaton scenario , there exists a late - decaying scalar condensation ( the curvaton ) which acquires amplitude fluctuation during the inflation .",
    "when the curvaton decays , fluctuation of the curvaton amplitude becomes the fluctuation of the radiation ( and of other components in the universe ) .",
    "thus , if the curvaton exists , properties of the present density fluctuations change compared to the standard scenario only with the inflaton . from the particle physics point of view",
    ", there are various well - motivated candidates of the curvaton @xcite .",
    "since the recent results from wilkinson microwave background probe ( wmap ) @xcite provided severe constraints on the properties of the primordial density fluctuations , it is interesting to reconsider the observational constraints in the framework of the curvaton scenario . with the curvaton , it is expected that the constraints on the inflation models are changed ( and possibly relaxed ) compared with the case without the curvaton .",
    "indeed , in the past , it was pointed out that the constraints on the scale of the inflation is drastically relaxed with the curvaton @xcite .",
    "then , there have been subsequent works focusing on the low scale inflation in the curvaton scenario @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors has shown that the quartic chaotic inflation model , which is marginally excluded by wmap observations , becomes viable when the curvaton mechanism applies . in ref .",
    "@xcite , several other inflation models were investigated such as chaotic inflation with several monomials , the natural inflation model and the new inflation model .",
    "the discussions made in refs .",
    "@xcite are mainly based on the scalar spectral index and the tensor - to - scalar ratio .",
    "importantly , although some inflation models can become viable with the curvaton even if they are excluded by current observations , there exist other class of models which can not be liberated even with the curvaton .",
    "in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was discussed how the liberation of inflation models depends on model parameters such as the initial amplitude , mass and decay rate of the curvaton field .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the implication of the curvaton on inflation models from some general points of view . in the previous works ,",
    "the analysis have been rather dependent on inflaton potentials .",
    "of course , it is important to study individual inflation models motivated from , in particular , particle physics point of view .",
    "it is , however , also possible to adopt some other approach , parameterizing the inflation models by using the slow - roll parameters ( at some epoch during the inflation ) . in this approach ,",
    "one generates inflation models with some stochastic method such as using the inflationary flow equations @xcite .",
    "such a method has been used in many studies including the one by the wmap team and constraints on inflation models have been discussed @xcite .",
    "although other approaches such as stochastic approaches or implementations of the flow equation are proposed @xcite , we discuss the implications of the curvaton on inflation models generated by the usual flow equation as an example .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we start with briefly reviewing the formalism to study how observable quantities are affected in the system containing the inflaton and the curvaton .",
    "we discuss how the standard scenario is modified in terms of the background evolution and the perturbation .",
    "we also review the classification of single - field inflation models .",
    "after the preparation , in section 3 , we go into how observational quantities are affected by introducing the curvaton and discuss it from some general viewpoints . in section 4 , we consider the effects of the curvaton on inflation models generated by the inflationary flow equation",
    ". then we conclude this note by summarizing the results in the final section .",
    "first we present the background evolution in the curvaton scenario comparing its counterpart of the standard case .    in the standard case , the potential energy of the inflaton drives the inflation . during inflation ,",
    "the inflaton slowly rolls down the potential .",
    "however , at some point , the inflaton starts to roll fast down the potential hill , then the inflaton begins to oscillate around the minimum of the potential .",
    "when the potential of the inflaton can be approximated by the quadratic form as @xmath2 , the energy density of the inflaton behaves as matter component . then the universe is dominated by the oscillating inflaton .",
    "we call this epoch `` @xmath3 dominated '' or `` @xmath3d . '' after some time , when the expansion rate of the universe , namely the hubble parameter , becomes as the same as the decay rate of the inflaton , the inflaton decays into radiation .",
    "then the universe becomes radiation dominated .",
    "this is , what we call , the standard thermal history of the universe",
    ".    when the curvaton exists , above picture is modified .",
    "first we consider the case where the initial amplitude of the curvaton is so small that the potential energy of the curvaton does not drive the ( second ) inflation . during inflation",
    ", the curvaton field stays at somewhere on the potential .",
    "if we adopt the potential of the curvaton to be of the form @xmath4 , the curvaton begins to oscillate around the minimum of the potential when the hubble parameter becomes of the same order of the mass of the curvaton . during this epoch",
    ", the energy density of the curvaton behaves as ordinary matter .",
    "this event usually happens when the universe is dominated by radiation which comes from the decay of the inflaton .",
    "since the energy density of matter decreases slower than that of radiation , at some point , the energy density of the curvaton becomes to dominate the universe .",
    "we call this epoch as @xmath5 dominated or @xmath5d .",
    "after some time , the curvaton also decays into radiation when the expansion rate of the universe becomes of the same order as the decay rate of the curvaton .",
    "then the universe becomes radiation dominated again .",
    "we call this epoch as rd2 not to confuse with the radiation dominated epoch from the inflaton decay .",
    "( we call the first radiation dominated epoch as rd1 . )",
    "next we discuss the case where the energy density of the curvaton can drive the second inflation after the first one induced by the inflaton .",
    "when the initial amplitude of the curvaton is large enough , the second inflation can happen after the @xmath3d or rd1 epoch before @xmath5 starts to oscillate . in this case",
    ", the universe experiences the inflation era driven by the inflaton , @xmath3d era , rd1 era and the second inflation driven by the curvaton potential energy , followed by the @xmath5d era and rd2 era .",
    "the second inflation can modify the observable quantities drastically in some cases .",
    "we discuss this point later .",
    "now we briefly review the issue of density perturbation in the standard case .    to discuss observational consequences",
    ", we have to set up the initial condition during radiation dominated era after the decay of the inflaton . for this purpose",

    "thus , the effects of the curvaton fluctuation ( i.e. , the values of @xmath105 ) on the distribution of models in the @xmath22 vs.  @xmath25 plane is not so significant compared with the case with small curvaton initial amplitude .",

    "in this paper , we discussed the effects of the curvaton on inflation models from some general points of view .",
    "for this purpose , first we classify inflation models in the @xmath22 vs.  @xmath25 plane into three categories : the `` small - field '' models , `` large - field '' models and `` hybrid - type '' models .    for the case",
    "that the initial amplitude of the curvaton is small ( @xmath150 ) and that the change of @xmath37 being negligible , we have shown how the scalar spectral index and the tensor - to - scalar ratio are modified for each models . in the `` small - field '' models , both the spectral index and the tensor - to - scalar ratio are not affected by the curvaton much ( although slight increase in @xmath22 can be seen ) . in the `` large - field '' models , the spectral index @xmath22 always increases and the tensor - to - scalar ratio is largely suppressed . in the `` hybrid - type '' models , the spectral index always decreases which is the opposite effect compared to the cases with the small - field and large - field models .",
    "we also investigated the effects of the curvaton on inflation models generated by the inflationary flow equation .",
    "since we gave a general argument how the observable quantities are affected by the curvaton , we can easily understand the modification of the structure of distribution of inflation models generated by the inflationary flow equation .    _",
