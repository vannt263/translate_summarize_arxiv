    "the gerasimov , drell , hearn ( gdh ) sum rule ( sr )  @xcite , which relates a system s anomalous magnetic moment to a weighted integral over a combination of doubly polarized photoabsorption cross sections , has received a good deal of attention in recent years .",
    "impressive experimental programs to measure these photoabsorption cross - sections for the nucleon have recently been carried out at elsa and mami ( for a review see ref .",
    "such measurements provide an empirical test of the gdh sr , and can be used to generate phenomenological estimates of electromagnetic polarizabilities via related srs , as will be discussed below .",
    "the gdh sr is particularly interesting because both its left- and right - hand - side can be reliably determined , thus providing a useful verification of the fundamental principles ( such as unitarity and analyticity ) which go into its derivation . at the present time",
    "the proton sum rule is satisfied within the experimental precision , while the case is still out for the neutron .",
    "however , it is not the purpose of this paper to discuss these experimental aspects of the sr , but rather to see what can be learned on the theoretical side .",
    "recently , we have shown  @xcite that by taking derivatives of the gdh sum rule with respect to the anomalous magnetic moment one can obtain a new set of sum rule - like relations with intriguing properties . in particular , this procedure provided a sum rule involving the anomalous magnetic moment _ linearly _ rather than quadratically , which allows for the derivation of quantities such as the schwinger moment in a much simpler fashion than via the usual gdh method . in this paper",
    ", we shall further examine these forms and apply them to the nucleon magnetic moment .",
    "after a lightning review of the gdh and related sum rules ( sect .",
    "ii ) , we derive the modified versions ( sect .",
    "iii ) and demonstrate that some of these relations have the form of so - called _ sideways _ dispersion relations ( sect .",
    "then we consider applications to the nucleon in the context of chiral perturbation theory and show how the new sum rules allow an elementary calculation ( to one loop ) of quantities such as magnetic moments ( sect .",
    "v ) and polarizabilities ( sect .",
    "vi ) to all orders in the heavy baryon expansion .",
    "the chiral behavior of the nucleon magnetic moments and polarizabilities is addressed in sect .",
    "returning to qed in sect .",
    "viii , we demonstrate how the new sum rules can be applied to the two - loop calculation of the anomalous magnetic moment in a straightforward fashion . in the final section ,",
    "we summarize our findings and suggest prospects for future work .",
    "the forward - scattering amplitude describing the elastic scattering of a photon on a target with spin @xmath0 ( real compton scattering ) is characterized by @xmath1 scalar functions which depend on a single kinematic variable , _",

    "the _ crossing symmetry _ of the compton amplitude of eq .",
    "( [ ddeq2.2.2 ] ) means invariance under @xmath7 , @xmath8 , which obviously leads to @xmath9 being an even and @xmath10 being an odd function of the energy@xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "the two scalar functions @xmath13 admit the following low - energy expansion ,    @xmath14    and hence , in the low - energy limit , are given in terms of the target s charge @xmath15 and anomalous magnetic moment ( a.m.m . ) @xmath16 .",
    "the next - to - leading order terms are given in terms of the nucleon electric ( @xmath17 ) , magnetic ( @xmath18 ) , and forward spin ( @xmath19 ) polarizabilities .    in order to derive sum rules ( srs ) for these quantities",
    "one assumes the scattering amplitude is an _ analytic _ function of @xmath2 everywhere but the real axis  , which allows writing the real parts of the functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 as a _ dispersion integral _ involving their corresponding imaginary parts .",
    "the latter , on the other hand , can be related to combinations of doubly polarized photoabsorption cross - sections via the _ optical theorem _",

    "after these steps one arrives at the results ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite for more details ) : [ eq : drf ] f ( ) & = & f(0 ) + _",
    "0^ d  , + [ eq : drg ] g ( ) & = & - _ 0^d  , with @xmath26 , and where the sum rule for the unpolarized forward amplitude @xmath9 has been once - subtracted to guarantee convergence .",
    "these relations can then be expanded in energy to obtain the srs for the different static properties introduced in . in this way",
    "we obtain the baldin sr  @xcite : @xmath27 the gdh sr : @xmath28 a sr for the forward spin polarizability : @xmath29 and , in principle , one could continue in order to isolate higher order moments@xcite .",
    "let us now see how these sum rules are of use in field theory .",
    "we first consider the case of the electron in qed .",
    "to lowest order in the fine - structure constant , @xmath30 , the photoabsorption process is given by the tree - level compton scattering .",
    "the tree - level helicity amplitudes for this process are well known  @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the electron mass ; @xmath0 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the mandelstam variables . using these results the unpolarized and double - polarized cross sections can be determined as : @xmath35+{\\cal o}(\\al_{em}^3 ) , \\label{eq : tot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath36 + { \\cal o}(\\al_{em}^3 ) , \\label{eq : gdhqed}\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath37 . substituting the latter expression into the  of the gdh sr ,",
    ", one can easily see that the integral vanishes exactly , which is required because otherwise the sum rule would lead to a nonsense result  the electron  would receive contributions of order @xmath38 .    at next order , @xmath39 ,",
    "the  of the gdh sr receives a nonzero contribution in the form of the schwinger correction : @xmath40 . in order to check that the same result is obtained on the  of the sum rule",
    "is quite a formidable task since at this order one must know the compton scattering amplitude to one loop , as well as account for the pair - production channel .",
    "nevertheless , the calculation of the relevant helicity amplitudes was carried out more than three decades ago by milton , tsai , and deraad and application to the gdh sr has relatively recently been performed by dicus and vega  @xcite , who verified ( numerically ) that the gdh sr holds at @xmath39 in qed .",
    "recently we have found a much simpler method by which to verify the gdh sr at this order .",
    "this technique is briefly described in the next section , while in the rest of the present section we examine the sum rules for polarizabilities , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : baldinsr ] ) and ( [ eq : gamma0sr ] ) . at first glance , such sum rules do not appear to be of much utility , since when evaluated in the case of qed , the static polarizabilities obtained therefrom _",
    "diverge_. however , this is not a problem , as pointed out by llanta and tarrach  @xcite , who emphasized that one _ can _ determine well defined asymptotic forms in the limit as @xmath41 approaches zero .",
    "thus , for example we can perform the integration for the spin even / odd amplitudes and determine that @xmath42 , \\ ] ] and @xmath43.\\ ] ] one can now use these expressions to define _ quasi - static _ polarizabilities , where by this we mean that these quantities contain both a constant term and a term which behaves as @xmath44it is this latter piece that is responsible for the divergence as the static limit is taken .",
    "thus , for example , we may define quasi - static values @xmath45,\\ ] ] for the sum of electric and magnetic polarizabilities and @xmath46,\\ ] ] for the forward spin polarizability . in this way we can also generate generalized sum rules for quadrupole and higher polarizabilities via eqs . and  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that it is possible to determine the _ nonanalytic _ component of these quasi - static moments in a simpler fashion  by using only the the _ low energy _ expansion of the cross sections .",
    "that is , while the integrals @xmath47 are @xmath48-dependent if @xmath49 is an even integer , in the case that @xmath49 is odd there exists a @xmath48-independent logarithm @xmath50 which then determines the logarithmic component of the quasi - static polarizabilities .",
    "that is , since @xmath51,\\ ] ] and @xmath52,\\ ] ] we require that the nonanalytic piece of the polarizabilities have the form @xmath53 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\gamma_0^{q - s}={\\al_{em}^2\\over 2\\pi m^4}\\left[{20\\over 3}\\log{\\omega\\over m}+\\ldots\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in agreement with the exact forms given above .",
    "likewise higher order forms can be determined .",
    "we see then that the use of dispersive techniques in qed allows a straightforward extraction of information about polarizabilities and about the anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "as expected , the latter is complete agreement with the result obtained by conventional means , while the former _ requires _ such dispersive methods , since the corresponding static quantities are divergent .",
    "we now review the derivation of the new form of sum rule .",
    "we begin by introducing a ` classical ' ( or trial ) value of the electron , @xmath54 . at the lagrangian level",
    "this amounts to the introduction of a pauli term for the spin-1/2 field  : _ = | _ f^ , where @xmath55 is the electromagnetic field tensor and @xmath56 $ ] is the usual dirac tensor operator . at the end of our calculation",
    ", we will set @xmath54 to zero , but for now the total value of the  is @xmath57 , with @xmath58 denoting the loop contribution .",
    "( it is important to note that both @xmath58 and the cross - section become explicitly dependent on @xmath54 . )",
    "we then start taking derivatives of the gdh sr with respect to @xmath54 , which is subsequently set to zero , so that the total  @xmath16 returns to its usual loop value .",
    "we find ( 4 ^ 2_em / m^2 )  & = & _ 0^  ( ) , + ( 4 ^ 2_em / m^2 ) ( ^2 +  ) & = & _ 0^  ( ) , and so on .",
    "to lowest order in @xmath59 we find ( 4 ^ 2_em / m^2 ) n^(n-1 ) = _ 0^",
    "^(n ) ( ) , [ eq : derivsr ] where @xmath60 denotes the @xmath49th derivative of @xmath16 with respect to @xmath54 .",
    "this allows in principle the computation of @xmath16 to order @xmath61 by using the 1st to @xmath49th derivatives of the cross - section computed to order @xmath62 to @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "in particular , to lowest order we have the result  : = _ 0^ .",
    "the striking feature of this sum rule is the _ linear _ relation between the  and the ( derivative of the ) photoabsorption cross section , in contrast to the gdh sr where @xmath16 appears quadratically , and although the cross - section quantity @xmath64 is not an observable , it is very clear how it can be determined within a specific theory .",
    "thus , for example , the first derivative of the tree - level cross - section with respect to @xmath54 , at @xmath65 , in qed was worked out in  @xcite : .()|__0=0 = .",
    "[ eq : gdh2 ] it is not difficult to find then that @xmath66 substituting this result in the _ linearized _ gdh sr , , we obtain @xmath67schwinger s one - loop result . we emphasize that this result is reproduced here by computing only a ( derivative of the ) _ tree - level _ compton scattering cross - section and then performing an integration over energy .",
    "this is definitely much simpler than obtaining the schwinger result from the gdh sr directly  @xcite , which requires input at the one - loop level . along these lines , however , one can facilitate the two- and more loop calculations .",
    "we elaborate on this possibility in sect .",
    "it is interesting to observe that , by changing the integration variable to @xmath68 , the linearized gdh sr , , can be written as = _",
    "m^2^ d s , which is a special case of a ` sideways dispersion relation ' as is demonstrated below .    the sideways dispersion for the  is obtained by considering the half - off - shell electromagnetic vertex : ^(p,p ) & = & ^(+)( ) + & + & ^(-)( ) ,",
    "with @xmath69 the photon momentum , @xmath70 the off - shell particle momentum ( @xmath71 ) , and @xmath72 the on - shell momentum ( @xmath73 ) .",

    "the  is identified as @xmath76 .",
    "akin to the compton amplitudes considered above , the form factors must be analytic functions of @xmath77 everywhere in the complex plane except along the unitarity cut , which lies on the real axis for re@xmath78 .",
    "this analyticity allows a dispersive representation for each of the form factors : f^()(s,q^2 ) & = & _ m^2^ds , + g^()(s,q^2 ) & = & _ m^2^ds , and these relations are called _ sideways _ dispersion relations  @xcite .    in particular , from the relation for @xmath79 we find = - _ m^2^ds , which is of the same form as the linearized gdh sum rule , .",
    "specifically , one can show that g^(+)(s,0 ) = - .",

    "consider now a theory of nucleons interacting with pions via pseudovector coupling : _ nn = |^^5 ^a _ ^a , where @xmath82 is the pion - nucleon coupling constant , @xmath32 is the nucleon mass , @xmath83 are isospin pauli matrices , @xmath84 is the nucleon field and @xmath85 is the isovector pion field . for our purposes",
    "this lagrangian is sufficient to obtain the leading order results of chiral perturbation theory .",
    "to lowest order in the coupling @xmath82 , the photoabsorption cross section in this theory is dominated by the single pion photoproduction graphs as displayed in ( a ) , and we find the corresponding helicity difference cross sections  :    ^(^0 p ) ( ) & = & \\ { ( 2|s+1-x ) - 2 } , + ^(^+ n ) ( ) & = & \\ { -^2 + 2(|s - x ) } , +",

    "it is therefore tempting to use the sr results for the parametrization of lattice data .",
    "for example , we consider the following elementary two - parameter form :    _ p&=&(1++_p^(loop ) ) , + _",
    "n&=&(+_n^(loop ) ) ,    where @xmath129 and @xmath130 are fixed to reproduce the experimental magnetic moments at the physical @xmath86 .",
    "the parameter @xmath131 can be fitted to lattice data .",
    "the solid curves in represent the result of such a single parameter fit to the lattice data of ref .",
    "@xcite for the proton and neutron respectively , where @xmath132 and @xmath133 , and @xmath32 is the physical nucleon mass .",
    "this parametrization incorporates the experimental value at the physical pion mass and reproduces very well the trend of the lattice data .",
    "we would like to stress here that at larger pion masses the chpt result should be interpreted as _ merely a convenient parametrization of lattice data , not as a prediction of the theory .",
    "_ in this way one obtains a parametrization which fits the lattice data at larger values of @xmath86 and has the correct dependence at lower values of @xmath86 .",
    "apparently , the relativistic chpt result which is consistent with analyticity provides the most convenient ground for the fit to lattice data , because it has an @xmath134 behavior at larger values of @xmath86 .",
    "it is useful to test the consistency of lattice simulations at larger @xmath86 and the experimental values based on such a single - free - parameter form which encodes the correct chiral behavior at low pion masses .",
    "the importance of the relativistic effects is even more emphasized in the polarizabilities . in",
    "we have plotted the ratio of one - loop @xmath135 , , to its leading non - analytic term [ first term in the expansion ] .",
    "recently , the electric and magnetic polarizabilities of hadrons have been calculated in lattice qcd using the external field method  @xcite .",
    "this method amounts to extract the electric and magnetic polarizabilities of hadrons from the quadratic term in the mass shift in an external electromagnetic field .",
    "the low statistics , pioneering results have so far been obtained for pion masses above 450 mev .",
    "as higher statistics calculations will become available in the near future  @xcite , our sum rule calculation of the pion mass dependence of the forward polarizabilities provides a way to connect these next generation lattice results to experiment .",
    "in this section we outline a procedure for two - loop calculations of the  by using derivative forms of the gdh sr . again , the gdh sr in its original form is practically unsuitable for such calculations , because in order to compute @xmath16 in , _",
    "e.g. _ , qed to order @xmath136 one needs to compute the photoabsorption cross - sections to order @xmath137also to two loops ! by contrast , using the derivative trick of sect .",
    "iii , we will need the ( derivatives of ) cross - sections up to order @xmath138 only  one loop forms .    introducing the",
    "` trial ' value of @xmath54 , such that the full  is defined as @xmath139 , and the gdh cross - section can be written as ( _ 0 ) = + _ 0  + _ 0 ^ 2  +  , the first and second derivatives of the gdh sr at @xmath65 read , respectively :    & & +  = _ 0^  + & & 2  + ( )^2 +  = _ 0^     now , consider at order @xmath136 : ^(2 ) + ^(1 ) ^(1 ) = _ 0^ ^(3 ) , where the superscript indicates the order of @xmath59 to which the quantity is considered . we can use and at order @xmath59 to obtain , respectively :    ^(1 ) & = & _ 0^ ^(2 ) , + ^(1 ) & = & _ 0^  ^(2 ) .    substituting these in",
    "we find the _",
    "linearized _ gdh sum rule at order @xmath136 : ^(2 ) = , and , using this sum rule one can obtain all two - loop corrections to the  by computing the first derivative of the gdh cross - section @xmath140 at one - loop and tree level , and a second derivative of the gdh cross - section @xmath141 at tree level .    for the qed case we have thus far worked out the required derivatives at tree level only .",
    "the first derivative is given in , while the second derivative is given by : ^(2)= , with @xmath142 .",
    "as already shown , the dispersion integral over the first derivative yields the schwinger correction , _ cf . _ .",
    "the integral over the second derivative is divergent and to evaluate it we introduce an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath143 : _ 0^ ",
    "^(2 ) = ( 5 - 6 ) .",
    "the same cutoff needs to be introduced in the first integral of the sum rule , such that the total result is independent of the cutoff .",
    "thus , in qed we obtain ^(2 ) = _ 0^",
    "^(3 ) - ( 5 - 6 ) .    in order to complete this two - loop calculation of the electron  in qed one would need to evaluate the first derivative @xmath81 at order @xmath138 which is given by the interference of the tree - level and one - loop compton scattering amplitudes , as well as by the tree - level bremsstrahlung and pair production mechanisms , all with one insertion of the pauli vertex .",
    "diagrammatically this calculation is depicted in .",
    "it is a future challenge to perform such calculation and to verify whether the linearized gdh sr reproduces the two - loop result obtained by usual techniques  @xcite : ^(2)= -0.328479 ( _ em^2/^2 ) .",
    "this would be an exact test of the gdh sr at the two - loop level .    in the case of the nucleon , sum rules analogous to may provide a more efficient method to do a two - loop calculation for the nucleon or for the forward spin polarizability , since much is already known about the one - loop chpt amplitudes of pion - photoproduction  @xcite , which are required in such a calculation .",
    "direct application of qcd to low energy hadronic physics is made challenging by the feature that the quark / gluon degrees of freedom in terms of which qcd is couched are confined within hadronic systems . nevertheless , the chiral eft of qcd ",
    "chiral perturbation theory  allows a predictive description of the low - energy hadronic reactions .",
    "also , by focusing on the chiral structure of the underlying lagrangian such eft methods permit one to make a link to lattice qcd calculations , even in the case where the mass of the underlying goldstone bosons is considerably heavier than found experimentally .",
    "these are the two fronts which at present make the chiral eft indispensable in relating qcd to low - energy observables .",
    "on the other hand there remain significant problems .",
    "indeed , most such calculations involving nucleons are carried out at low orders in so - called heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory , which involves an expansion in powers of the inverse nucleon mass . on the other hand ,",
    "we have demonstrated above by simple examples involving the nucleon magnetic moment and polarizabilities , that manifestly relativistic calculations , which include chiral corrections to all orders in @xmath144 , do a better job than the `` heavy - baryon '' ones on both fronts in capturing the full implications of the theory .",
    "for this reason it is important to have at one s disposal methods which allow such all orders evaluation of experimental quantities .",
    "this can in principle be achieved using conventional relativistic chiral loop calculations , but the price in terms of the number of diagrams which must be evaluated is high .",
    "for example , a one - loop evaluation of the nucleon polarizability involves fifty - two such diagrams for the proton and twenty - two for the neutron@xcite ! above",
    "we have presented an alternative approach , involving the use of dispersion relations and their related sum rules .",
    "the calculations done in this work were based on real - compton - scattering sum rules , such as gdh and baldin sum rules",
    ". however , the results are identical to what one would obtain in the usual loop calculations , provided no manipulations , such as _ infrared regularization _ which change the analytic structure are made . as is shown in the works of gegelia _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , there is no problem with power counting in this straightforward formulation of covariant chpt , if the renormalization is performed in a suitable way .",
    "both the infrared - regularized and the straightforward formulation of relativistic baryon chpt resum the nominally higher - order relativistic effects , albeit differently .",
    "we stress that the resummation in the straightforward version is done in accordance with the principle of _",
    "analyticity_.    we demonstrated above the utility of taking derivatives of the gdh sum rule , in order to convert it to forms which are sometimes more calculationally robust .",
    "we showed that in some cases these modified versions of the sum rules are equivalent to _ sideways _ dispersion relations , which involve taking the final ( or initial ) nucleon four  momentum off - shell .",
    "using such relations , we straightforwardly evaluated fully relativistic nucleon magnetic moments and polarizabilities , using only tree level inputs and showed that they were fully equivalent to values obtained via much more labor - intensive loop techniques .",
    "we showed that such methods should also permit a future evaluation of the two loop electron anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "the successes demonstrated above suggest an obvious direction for future work .",
    "in particular , the use of dispersive methods would seem to be ideal for a simplified way to perform two - loop evaluations . an obvious first test would be to use one - loop corrected photoproduction amplitudes in order to produce corresponding one - loop photoabsorption cross sections , which can in turn be used to generate two - loop values of polarizabilities and of magnetic moments which are relativistically correct .",
    "these can then be compared to ongoing calculations at two loop in the heavy baryon expansion for the forward spin polarizability and with the  experimental \" value obtained from the sum rule . in conclusion",
    "there is much which can be done with such methods , and many future applications can be envisioned .",
