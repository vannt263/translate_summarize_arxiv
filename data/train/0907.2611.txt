    "though it has been more than 40 years since the discovery of radio pulsars , their real nature is still not yet clear because of the uncertainty about cold matter at supranuclear density . both neutron matter and quark matter are two conjectured states for such compact objects .",
    "the objects with the former are called neutron stars , and with the latter are quark stars .",
    "it is an astrophysical challenge to observationally distinguish real quark stars from neutron stars ( see reviews by , e.g. , madsen 1999 ; glendenning 2000 ; lattimer & prakash 2001 ; kapoor & shukre 2001 ; weber 2005 ; xu 2008 ) . the most obvious discrepancy could be the minimal spin period of these two distinct objects .",
    "the minimal periods of these two kinds of objects are related to their formation process .",
    "how fast a neutron star or a quark star can rotate during the recycling process in low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) has been considered by several authors ( bulik , gondek - rosi@xmath5ska & klu@xmath6niak 1999 ; blaschke et al .",

    "significant difficulties do exist in current radio surveys for binary sub - millisecond pulsars due to strong doppler modulation and computational limitations ( burderi et al . 2001 ) .",
    "how do sub - millisecond pulsars form ?",
    "this is still an open question which we will explore in this paper .",
    "previously , discussions were concentrated on the formation of neutron stars or quark stars spun up via accretion in binaries .",
    "we have considered a new approach to create a sub - millisecond pulsar ( quark star ) with super - keplerian spin via accretion induced collapse ( aic ) of a massive white dwarf ( wd ) .",
    "the initial spin of the newborn quark star could be super - keplerian , and it can have a long lifetime in sub - millisecond phase and produce enough strong radio emission to be detected .    in @xmath10 , we discuss low mass quark stars formed from aic of wds , which can have an minimal initial period of sub - millisecond . in @xmath11 , the radiation parameters and the conditions for pair production are estimated in order to investigate whether the aic - induced quark stars could be pulsars or not .",
    "the lifetimes of sub - millisecond pulsars are also estimated and the possibility of detection is discussed .",
    "the spin - down evolution diagrams of a newborn quark star and neutron star are also plotted . in @xmath12 , as a comparison , the sub - millisecond pulsars formed through accretion acceleration ( spin - up ) in binary systems are also considered . in @xmath13 , conclusions and discussions are presented .",
    "neutron star s formation from aic of a massive white dwarf is widely discussed by many authors ( nomoto et al . 1979 ; nomoto & kondo 1991 ; van paradijs et al . 1997 ; fryer et al . 1999 ; bravo & garca - senz 1999 ; dessart et al . 2006 ) .",
    "recently , it is pointed out that galactic core - collapse supernova rate can not sustain all the separate neutron star populations ( keane & kramer 2008 ) , which implies other mechanisms for forming neutron stars .",
    "aic of a massive wd can be an important mechanism for pulsar formation , even for isolated pulsars if the binary systems are destroyed due to strong kicks .",
    "we now discuss the possibility for a low mass quark star formed from aic of a wd . in a binary system , when the wd has accreted enough matter from the companion so that its mass reaches the chandrasekhar limit , the process of electron capture may induce gravitational collapse .",
    "the detonation waves burn nuclear matter into strange quark matter which spread out from the inner core of the wd ( lugones , benvenuto & vucetich 1994 ) .",
    "a boundary of strange quark matter and nuclear matter will be found at the radius where the detonation waves stop when nuclear matter density drops below a critical value .",
    "a similar process was also discussed and calculated by chen , yu & xu ( 2007 ) .",
    "the size of the inner collapsed core may depend on the chemical composition and accretion history of the wd ( nomoto & kondo 1991 ) .",
    "consequently , quark stars with different masses could be formed .",
    "both rigidly and differentially rotating wds are taken into account . as a first step , we assume that both the collapsed wd and the newborn quark star have rigidly rotating configurations for simplicity .",
    "the wds , progenitors of these quark stars , could have a uniformly rotating configuration due to the effects of crystallization , as well as an increase of central density may lead to catastrophic evolution ( supernova ) ( koester 1974 ) .",
    "with these assumptions , a model of sub - millisecond pulsars formation is given below .",
    "the initial spin period of aic - produced quark stars can be estimated as follows .",
    "we assume that the mass ( @xmath14 ) of the nascent quark star ranges from @xmath15 to @xmath16 , and the white dwarf rotates rigidly at the kepler period ( @xmath17 ) just before collapsing .",
    "the quark star s rest mass ( @xmath14 ) is approximately equal to the mass ( @xmath18 ) of the inner collapsed core of the white dwarf .",
    "if the angular momentum is conserved during aic , the newborn quark star can rotate at a much shorter period , @xmath19 , then @xmath20this is to say , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the quark star s moment of inertia , and @xmath23 is the moment of inertia of wd s inner collapsed core , which can be well approximated by @xmath24 the mass and radius of a low mass @xmath25 quark star could be approximately related by @xmath26 ( alcock , farhi & olinto 1986 ) in the bag model .",

    "( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , one can make numerical calculation to get the wd s theoretical relation of mass and radius ( the red line in figure 1 ) . for comparison",
    ", one can see a figure on line . before collapsing ,",
    "the mass of a wd is close to the chandrasekhar mass limit , as high as @xmath46 ( shu 1982 ) , the corresponding radius is much smaller , such as @xmath47 km .",
    "we could numerically obtain the initial period , @xmath19 , of nascent quark stars with different mass via eq .",
    "( 2 ) , and find that almost all the values of @xmath19 are around @xmath0 ms ( see table 1 ) if the wd rotates rigidly at an almost kepler period due to accretion ( or spin - up ) in a binary just before collapsing .",
    "the newborn quark stars surface spin velocities are well above the kepler velocities , we regard this as `` the super - keplerian case '' .",
    "wds may be rotating differentially .",
    "the detailed calculations are given in appendix a. therefore , as a follow - up second step , we also use eqs .",
    "( 2 ) , ( 5 ) , ( 6 ) and ( a2 ) to calculate the initial spin period of the nascent quark stars in the differentially rotating wd model , taking the free parameter @xmath48 .",
    "the results are also shown in table 1 .",
    "a newborn quark star could certainly rotate differentially , and may be relaxed to become a rigidly rotating configuration finally",
    ". however , the timescale of the relaxation depends on the viscosity and the state of cold quark matter  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the newborn quark star s relaxation ( from differentially rotating configuration to rigidly rotating configuration ) may be due to fast solidification after birth .",
    "a calculation shows that the solidification timescale is only @xmath49 s  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the relaxation timescale could be much shorter than the lifetime of pulsars within sub - millisecond periods ( see the following section 3.3 ) .",
    "the wd re j0317 - 853 has the highest observed mass ( 1.34 @xmath7 close to the chandrasekhar limit ) with radius of 2400 km ( naleyty & madej 2004 ) .",
    "if a wd like re j0317 - 853 could be in a binary and accreted enough materials to the chandrasekhar limit , then it may collapse .",
    "therefore , under this assumption , we also calculated the initial spin periods @xmath50 and @xmath51 of a nascent quark star .",
    "the calculated results are listed in table 1 .",
    "it is found that , even if a wd has a larger radius such as 2400 km , it can also collapse to a sub - millisecond quark star for either rigidly or differentially rotating wd models . in the differentially rotating wd model",
    ", it tends to give a rigidly rotating configurations in the limit of large values of @xmath52 , @xmath53 increases as the parameter @xmath52 increases .",
    "the conclusions from the rigid rotation model are valid even if differential rotation is included .",
    "can a quark star survive even if it rotates at such a high frequency ( @xmath54 hz ) ? will it be torn apart by the centrifugal force ? there are quite distinguishing characteristics between neutron stars and quark stars .",
    "a low mass quark star is possible to spin at a super - keplerian frequency because it is self - bound by strong interaction . on one hand , as noted by qiu & xu ( 2006 ) , astrophysical quark matter splitting could be color - charged if color confinement can not be held exactly because of causality . on the other hand , however , rapidly spinning quark matter could hardly split if color confinement is held exactly .",
    "in addition , the recently discovered nature of strongly coupled quark gluon plasma ( sqgp ) as realized at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) experiment ( e.g. , shuryak 2006 ) may also prevent a super - keplerian quark star to split .",
    "the short spin period above is not surprising , and could be verified for a simplified special case , if both quark star s density ( = 4@xmath30 ) and white dwarf s density ( @xmath55 ) are uniform .",
    "( 2 ) and the mass - radius relation , we can find the initial period of the quark star to be @xmath56 ( with @xmath57 the spin period of white dwarf , @xmath58 g @xmath59 , @xmath60 @xmath61 ) , which depends only on the densities of wd and quark star .",
    "if the wd has not been spun up fully to the kepler period , i.e. , the wd rotates at a sub - keplerian period ( e.g. , several times of @xmath17 ) before aic , can the initial period of a newborn quark star formed from such a wd be of sub - millisecond ?",
    "we investigated the case of a massive wd ( 1.4@xmath7 , 410 km ) rotating at a period @xmath62 ms .",
    "the initial spin period of quark stars with different mass are as follows : @xmath63 ms for a quark star with mass of @xmath64 ; @xmath65ms for @xmath66 ; @xmath67ms for @xmath68 and @xmath69ms for @xmath70 .",
    "the spin - down feature of such a newborn quark star depends on its gravitational wave radiation and magnetodipole radiation ( see details in @xmath71 ) .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     there is also an important mechanism of `` spin - up in binaries '' for sub - millisecond pulsars formation , which is widely discussed in the literatures .",
    "we regard this as `` sub - keplerian case '' and make a comparison with our proposed aic model `` super - keplerian case '' . in this section",
    ", we will find the minimal periods for both neutron stars and bare quark stars spun up by accretion in binary systems .",
    "we assume that the initial rotational periods of newborn pulsars could have an `` equilibrium period '' with two characteristic parameters : magnetospheric radius and corotation radius .",
    "the magnetospheric radius @xmath72 is the radius where the ram pressure of particles is equal to the local magnetic pressure , i.e. @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the magnetic moment of per unit mass of the compact star ; @xmath75 is the surface magnetic strength in units of @xmath76 g and @xmath77 is the accretion rate in units of @xmath78 ; @xmath79 is the ratio between the magnetospheric radius and the alfv@xmath80n radius ( wang 1997 ; burderi & king 1998 ) .",
    "wang ( 1997 ) studied the torque exerted on an oblique rotator and pointed out that @xmath79 decreased from 1.35 to 0.65 as the inclination angle increased from @xmath81 to @xmath82 .",
    "here we take @xmath83 , the influence of @xmath79 is discussed in @xmath84 .",
    "when @xmath85 is very close to the compact star s radius , we could rewrite the accretion rate @xmath86 in units of eddington accretion rate ( @xmath87 ) , with a ratio , @xmath88 , so that @xmath89 with these equations obtained above , then we can get @xmath85 for quark stars , @xmath90 the corotation radius is @xmath91 cm .",
    "the spin periods of compact stars can not exceed the kepler limit via accretion .",
    "when the compact star was spun up to the kepler limit by the accreted matter falling onto the compact star s surface , for neutron stars , as the equatorial radius expanded , one can use the simple empirical relation for the maximum spin frequency    @xmath92    ( haensel & zdunik 1989 ; lattimer & prakash 2004 ) , which leads to @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath29 refer to the neutron star s mass and radius of nonrotating configurations .    for quark stars , gourgoulhon et al .",

    "these are the so - called `` sub - keplerian condition '' .",
    "the accretion torque , @xmath99 , exerted on the compact star contains two contributions : one is positive material torque which is carried by the materials falling onto the star s surface ; the other is magnetic torque which can be positive or negative , depending on the fastness parameter @xmath100 . it is suggested that all the torques may cancel one another if the fastness is @xmath101 ( dai & li 2006 ) .",
    "this implies a magnetospheric radius of @xmath102 .",
    "one can obtain an equilibrium period of @xmath103 when setting @xmath104 , @xmath105 for quark stars , the equilibrium period is independent of mass and radius , and only dependent on bag constant , surface magnetic field , and accretion rate .",

    "the minimal equilibrium period is calculated using the eq .",
    "( see results in table 4 . )    in the sub - keplerian case , the timescales in the phase of sub - millisecond for quark stars of different mass and neutron stars of different eoss are listed in table 3 and table 4 , respectively . for typical quark stars as well as neutron stars with high @xmath113 ,",
    "their lifetimes in the phase of sub - millisecond period are about @xmath114 years , which result in a too low detection possibility . however ,",
    "for low @xmath113 , the lifetime of a sub - millisecond pulsar ( even with a high mass ) is long enough .",
    "if a sub - millisecond pulsar is ever found , we have shown that it could be a quark star based upon plausible scenarios for its origin , the energy available for radiation and its lifetime . a new possible way to form sub - millisecond pulsars ( quark stars ) via aic of white dwarfs has been discussed in this paper . in the super - keplerian case , we derived the initial period @xmath19 via angular momentum conservation with consideration of the special and general relativistic effects , and calculated the lifetime and gap parameters of a newborn quark star .",
    "quark stars with different masses could have the minimal rotational period around 0.1 ms .",
    "in most cases , quark stars would be bare ( xu 2002 ) , therefore , a vacuum gap would be formed in the polar cap region . based on our rough estimations without considering the effect of frame dragging ( harding & muslimov 1998 ) , we found that the basic parameters ( including rotational energy loss ) in the gap are suitable for pair ( electrons and positrons ) production and sparking .",
    "they can be detected as sub - millisecond radio pulsars .",
    "we also used an approximate formula to calculate nascent quark star s moment of inertia , but there are no accurate solutions to fast rotating compact stars configuration until nowadays .",
    "it should be investigated precisely in the future . in the calculation of wd s mass and radius , we just considered the non - rotating configuration .",
    "but it does not change the conclusions of this paper .",
    "if the central density @xmath115 of the wd is lower than @xmath116  g  @xmath33 before collapsing , the resulting wd has a larger radius and moment of inertia , consequently , the newborn quark star could have a smaller spin period ( @xmath1171ms ) .",
    "both the special and general relativistic effects are weak for a low mass ( e.g. jupiter - like ) quark star with a small radius .",
    "the rotational energy is lost via gw and em radiation .",
    "the gw radiation dominates the rotational energy loss in the phase of sub - millisecond period , if magnetic field of stars is not so large .",
    "such quark stars therefore have long lifetimes ( several million years if mass @xmath118 ) to maintain their spin periods of sub - millisecond .",
    "we have considered the bar - mode of gw radiation in this paper , while other gw mode ( e.g. r - mode ) may be important but not yet considered here  @xcite .",
    "the subsequent relaxation timescale of a newborn quark star to a rigidly rotating configuration could be negligible since a quark star may be solidified soon after birth .    an important constraint for sub - millisecond pulsar s detection is its lifetime in the phase of @xmath119ms due to gw and em radiation . a possible method is proposed to constrain the lower limit of the pulsars equatorial ellipticity , i. e. , @xmath120 , by evaluating millisecond pulsars period derivative via eq .
