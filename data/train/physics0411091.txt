    "understanding the emergence and persistence of cooperation is one of the central problems in evolutionary biology and socioeconomics @xcite . in investigating this problem",
    "the standard framework utilized is evolutionary game theory @xcite .",
    "especially two models , the prisoner s dilemma @xcite and its variation , the snowdrift game @xcite , have attracted most attention . in both games , the players can either cooperate for common good , or defect and exploit other players in attempt to gain benefits individually . in the prisoner",
    "s dilemma , the precondition is that it pays off to be non - cooperative . because of this , defection is the only evolutionarily stable strategy ( ess ) in populations which are fully mixed , i.e. where each player interacts with any other player @xcite .",
    "however , several models which are extensions of the prisoner s dilemma have proved to sustain cooperation .",
    "these models include those in which the players are assumed to have memory of the previous interactions @xcite , or characteristics that allow cooperators and defectors to distinguish each other @xcite , or players are spatially distributed @xcite .",
    "a typical spatial game is such where player - player interactions only take place within restricted neighborhoods on regular lattices @xcite or on complex networks @xcite .",
    "these games have been found to generate highly complex behavior and enable the persistence of cooperation . regarding the latter ,",
    "the opposite was recently seen in the case of the snowdrift game played on a two - dimensional lattice @xcite , where the spatial structure resulted in decreased cooperator densities compared to the fully mixed `` mean - field '' case .",
    "this result was surprising , as intermediate levels of cooperation persist in unstructured snowdrift games , and the common belief has been that spatial structure is usually beneficial for sustained levels of cooperation .    in these studies",
    "the viewpoint has largely been that of biological evolution , as represented by the so - called _ replicator dynamics _",
    "@xcite , where the fraction of players who use high - payoff - strategies grow ( stochastically ) in the population proportionally to the payoffs .",
    "this mechanism can be viewed as depicting darwinian evolution , where the fittest have the largest chance of survival and reproduction .",
    "overall , the factors influencing the outcomes of these spatially structured games are ( i ) the rules determining the payoffs ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , ( ii ) the topology of the spatial structure ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and ( iii ) the rules determining the evolution of each player s strategy ( e.g. ref .",
    "we have studied the effect of changing the strategy evolution rules ( iii ) in the two - dimensional snowdrift game similar to that discussed in ref .  @xcite . in our version ,",
    "the rules have been defined in such a way that changes in the players strategies represent player _ decisions _ instead of different strategy genotypes in the next evolutionary generation of players .",
    "thus , the time scale of the population dynamics in our model can be viewed to be much shorter than evolutionary time scales . instead of utilizing the evolution - inspired replicator dynamics ,",
    "we have endowed the players with primitive `` intelligence '' in the form of local decision - making rules determining their strategies .",
    "we show with simulations and analytic approach that these rules result in cooperation levels which differ largely from those obtained using the replicator dynamics .    in this study we will concentrate on an adaptive snowdrift game , with agents interacting with their nearest neighbor agents on a two - dimensional square lattice . in what follows",
    "we first describe our spatial snowdrift model and then analyze its equilibrium states .",
    "next we present our simulation results and finally draw some conclusions .",
    "the snowdrift model can be illustrated with a situation in which two cars are caught in a blizzard and there is a snowdrift blocking their way .",
    "the cars are equipped with shovels , and the drivers have two choices : either start shoveling the road open or remain in the car .",
    "if the road is cleared , both drivers gain the benefit @xmath1 of getting home . on the other hand",
    ", clearing the road requires some work , and cost @xmath2 can be assigned to it ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "if both drivers are cooperative and willing to shovel , this workload is shared between them , and both of them gain total benefit of @xmath4 .",
    "if both choose to defect , i.e. remain in their cars , neither one gets home and thus both obtain zero benefit @xmath5 . if only one of the drivers shovels , both get home , but",
    "the defector avoids the cost and gains benefit @xmath6 , whereas the cooperator s benefit is reduced by the workload , i.e. @xmath7 .    the above described situation can be presented with the bi - matrix @xcite ( table [ payoffs ] ) , where @xmath8 in case of the so called one - shot game , each player has two available strategies , namely defect ( d ) or cooperate ( c ) .",
    "the players choose their strategies simultaneously , and their individual payoffs are given by the appropriate cell of the bi - matrix . by convention ,",
    "the payoff to the so - called row player is the first payoff given , followed by the payoff of the column player .",
    "thus , if for example player 1 chooses d and player 2 chooses c , then player 1 receives the payoff t and player 2 the payoff s.    the best action depends on the action of the co - player such that defect if the other player cooperates and cooperate if the other defects .",
    "a simple analysis shows that the game does not have _ stable evolutionary strategy _",
    "@xcite , if the agents use only pure strategies , i.e. , they can choose either to cooperate or to defect with probability one , but they are not allowed to use a strategy which mixes either of these actions with some probability @xmath9 .",
    "this leads to stable existence of cooperators and defectors in well - mixed populations @xcite .",
    "lll & d & c + d & p , p & t , s + c & s , t & r , r +    in order to study the effect of spatial structure on the snowdrift game , we set the players on a regular two - dimensional square lattice consisting of @xmath10 cells .",
    "we adopt the notation of ref .",
    "( @xcite ) and identify each cell by an index @xmath11 which also refers to its spatial position . each cell , representing a player , is characterized by its strategy @xmath12 , which can be either to cooperate ( @xmath13 ) or to defect ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the spatio - temporal distribution of the players is then described by @xmath15 which is an element of a @xmath16 dimensional hypercube",
    ". then every player  henceforth called an _ agent _  interacts with their @xmath17 nearest neighbors .",
    "we use either the moore neighborhood in which case each agent has @xmath18 neighbors , in n , ne , e , se , s , sw , w and nw , or the von neumann neighborhood in which case each agent has @xmath19 neighbors , in n , e , s and w compass directions @xcite .",
    "we require that an agent plays _ simultaneously _ with all its @xmath17 neighbors , and define the payoffs for this @xmath20 game such that an agent @xmath21 who interacts with @xmath22 cooperators and @xmath23 defectors , @xmath24 , gains a benefit of @xmath25 from defecting or cooperating , respectively .    for determining their strategies ,",
    "the agents are endowed with primitive decision - making capabilities .",
    "the agents retain no memory of the past , and are not able to predict how the strategies of the neighboring agents will change .",
    "every agent simply assumes that the strategies of other agents within its neighborhood remain fixed , and chooses an action that maximizes its own payoff . in this sense",
    "the agents are myopic . the payoff is maximized , if an agent ( a ) defects when @xmath26 , and ( b ) cooperates when @xmath27 .",
    "if ( c ) @xmath28 the situation is indifferent . using eqs .",
    "( [ neiguta ] ) and ( [ neigutb ] ) we can connect the preferable choice of an agent and the payoffs of the game .",
    "let us denote @xmath29 then , if @xmath30    thus , for each individual agent , the ratio @xmath31 determines a following decision - boundary @xmath32 which depends on the neighborhood size @xmath17 and the `` temptation '' parameter @xmath31 . because @xmath31 is determined only by the differences @xmath33 and @xmath34 , we can fix two of the payoff values , say @xmath35 and @xmath5 .",
    "based on the above , we define the following rules for the agents :    1 .   if an agent @xmath21 plays at time @xmath36 a strategy @xmath37 for which @xmath38 , then at time @xmath39 the agent plays @xmath40 .",
    "if an agent @xmath21 plays at time @xmath36 a strategy @xmath37 for which @xmath41 , then at time @xmath39 the agent plays @xmath42 with probability @xmath0 , and @xmath43 with probability @xmath44 .    hence , the strategy evolution of an individual agent is determined by the current strategies of the other agents within its neighborhood , with the parameter @xmath0 acting as a `` regulator '' which moderates the rate of changes .",
    "a spatial game is in stable state or equilibrium if retaining the current strategy is beneficial for all the agents  @xcite .",
    "there can be numerous equilibrium configurations , depending on the temptation parameter @xmath31 , geometry and size of the @xmath17-neighborhood , and the size and boundary conditions of the lattice upon which the game is played .",
    "an aggregate quantity of particular interest is the fraction of cooperators @xmath45 in the whole population ( or , equivalently , that of the defectors @xmath46 ) .",
    "below , we derive limits for @xmath45 , first in a `` mean - field '' picture based cooperator densities within neighborhoods and then by investigating local neighborhood configurations .      without detailed knowledge of local equilibrium configurations",
    "we can already derive some limits for the fraction of cooperators in equilibrium .",
    "let us consider a square lattice with @xmath47 cells with periodic boundary conditions , where @xmath48 is the linear size of the lattice , and assume that @xmath49 cells are occupied by cooperators .",
    "we denote by @xmath50 the number of those agents who have @xmath51 cooperators each in their @xmath17-neighborhood , excluding the agents themselves , and denote the local density of cooperators in such neighborhoods by @xmath52 .",
    "hence , the total amount of cooperators @xmath49 can be written in terms of the densities as follows    @xmath53    from eqs .",
    "( [ boundarya])-([boundaryc ] ) we can infer that a cooperator will retain its current strategy , if it has at most @xmath2 cooperators in its @xmath17-neighborhood , where @xmath2 is the integer part of @xmath54 .",
    "similarly , a defector will remain a defector if it has more than @xmath2 cooperators in its neighborhood .",
    "thus , in equilibrium , all agents having @xmath55 cooperators in their neighborhood are likewise cooperators , and thus @xmath56 .",
    "we denote by @xmath57 the average density of cooperators as the nearest neighbors of cooperators .",
    "similarly , @xmath58 denotes the average density of cooperators as the nearest neighbors of defectors , i.e. @xmath59",
    ". then we can write eq .",
    "( [ id1 ] ) as @xmath60    the density @xmath61 of cooperators around each cooperator is bounded : @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and as @xmath64 , the relation @xmath65 holds for the average density .",
    "similarly , the density of cooperators around each defector @xmath66 can be at most @xmath67 and is at least @xmath68 , and thus the average density @xmath69 . using these relations together with eq .",
    "( [ id2 ] ) we obtain the following limits for the density of cooperators @xmath70 in the whole agent population ( see also fig .  [ fig1 ] ) : @xmath71      in the above derivation we ignore how the strategies can actually be distributed in the lattice .",
    "hence , it is of interest to examine possible local equilibrium configurations of the player strategies .",
    "again , eqs .",
    "( [ boundarya])-([boundaryc ] ) tell us how many cooperative neighbors each defector or cooperator can have in the equilibrium state .",
    "the number of cooperators around each agent depends on the value of the temptation parameter @xmath31 , and for a given value of @xmath31 the lattice has to be filled such that these conditions hold for the neighborhood of each agent . in a lattice with periodic boundary conditions , the lattice size @xmath72 and the neighborhood size",
    "@xmath17 obviously have an effect on the elementary configurations .",
    "hence , we restrict ourselves to infinite - sized lattices , filled by repeating elementary configuration blocks , and look for the resulting limits on the cooperator density @xmath45 .",
    "note that these conclusions also hold for finite lattices with periodic boundary conditions , if @xmath73 and @xmath74 are integer multiples of @xmath75 and @xmath76 , respectively , where @xmath77 is the elementary block size . here",
    ", we will restrict the analysis to the case of the moore neighborhood with @xmath18 .",
    "lllccll i & @xmath78 & @xmath79 & @xmath80 & @xmath81 & @xmath82 & @xmath83 + 1&@xmath84 & @xmath85 & 8 & 7 & @xmath86 & @xmath87 + 2&@xmath85 & @xmath88 & 7 & 6 & @xmath89 & @xmath90 + 3&@xmath88 & @xmath91 & 6 & 5 & @xmath92 & @xmath89 + 4&@xmath91 & @xmath93 & 5 & 4 & @xmath92 & @xmath89 + 5&@xmath93 & @xmath94 & 4 & 3 & @xmath95 & @xmath92 + 6&@xmath94 & @xmath96 & 3 & 2 & @xmath97 & @xmath92 + 7&@xmath96 & @xmath98 & 2 & 1 & @xmath99 & @xmath97 + 8&@xmath98 & @xmath100 & 1 & 0 & @xmath101 & @xmath102 +    as an example , consider the local configurations when @xmath103 , and hence the decision boundary value @xmath104 .",
    "thus , from eqs .",
    "( [ boundarya])-([boundaryc ] ) one can infer that in equilibrium all defectors should have more than @xmath105 cooperators in their moore neighborhoods . because the number of cooperating neighbors can take only integer values",
    ", this means that every one of the @xmath18 neighbors of a defector should be a cooperator . on the other hand , from eqs .",
    "( [ boundarya])-([boundaryc ] ) we see that the density @xmath61 of cooperators around each cooperator should be less than @xmath106 , i.e. they should have at most @xmath107 cooperators in their moore neighborhood .",
    "the smallest repeated elementary block fulfilling both conditions is a @xmath108-square with one defector ",
    "when the lattice is filled with these blocks , the cooperator density equals @xmath109 ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) , case 1 , left block ) . on the other hand ,",
    "both requirements are likewise fulfilled with a repeated @xmath110-square , where the central cell is a defector and the rest are cooperators , resulting in the cooperator density of @xmath111 .",
    "this configuration is illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) , as case 1 , right block .    by continuing the analysis of elementary configuration blocks in similar fashion for different values of @xmath31",
    ", we obtain lower and upper limits for the fraction of cooperators , which are listed in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the corresponding elementary configuration blocks are depicted in fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the table is read so that when the value of the temptation parameter is within the interval @xmath112 , the number of cooperators in each defector s neighborhood @xmath113 must be at least @xmath114 and the number of cooperators in each cooperator s neighborhood @xmath115 can be at most @xmath116 . here",
    "@xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 these conditions are those of eqs .",
    "( [ boundarya])-([boundaryc ] ) and they are fulfilled by the configuration blocks depicted in fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) , for which the minimum and maximum densities of cooperators are @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "we have studied the above described spatial snowdrift model with discrete time - step simulations on a @xmath120-lattice with periodic boundary conditions . we have specifically analyzed the behavior of the cooperator density @xmath45 , and equilibrium lattice configurations . in the simulations ,",
    "the lattice is initialized randomly so that each cell contains a cooperator or defector with equal probability .",
    "however , biasing the initial densities toward cooperators or defectors was found to have no considerable effect on the outcome of the game .",
    "we have simulated the game using both the moore and the von neumann neighborhoods with @xmath18 and @xmath19 nearest neighbors , respectively . in the simulations we update strategies of the agents asynchronously @xcite with the random sequential update scheme , so that during one simulation round , every agent s strategies are updated in random order . in the following",
    ", the time scale is defined in terms of these simulation rounds .",
    "first , we have studied the development of the cooperator density @xmath45 as a function of time . as expected",
    ", the probability @xmath0 of discontent agents changing their strategies plays the role of defining the convergence time scale only would be more important if synchronous update rules were used . in that case",
    "@xmath121 corresponds to a situation where each discontent agent simultaneously changes its strategy to the opposite .",
    "this , then , could result in a frustrated situation with oscillating cooperator density .",
    "however , small enough values of @xmath0 should damp these oscillations , resulting in static equilibrium .",
    "] , as in the long run @xmath45 converges to a stable value irrespective of @xmath0 .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , which shows @xmath45 as function of time for several values of @xmath0 and two different values of the temptation @xmath31 . in these runs , we have used the moore neighborhood , i.e. @xmath18 . in all the studied cases , @xmath45 turns out to converge quite rapidly to a constant value , @xmath122 for @xmath123 and @xmath124 for @xmath125 .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath45 does not have to converge to exactly the same stable value for the same @xmath31 ; even if the game is considered to be in equilibrium , there can be some variance in @xmath45 , which is also visible in fig .",
    "however , the value of @xmath45 was found to eventually remain stable during individual runs , i.e. no oscillations were detected .",
    "next , we have studied the average equilibrium fraction of cooperators @xmath126 in the agent population as function of the temptation parameter @xmath31 . we let the simulations run for 500 rounds ( with @xmath127 ) , and averaged the fraction of cooperators for the subsequent 500 rounds . in all cases , the fraction had already converged before the averaging rounds .",
    "( [ fig4 ] ) shows the results for the von neumann neighborhood ( @xmath19 ) , illustrated as the squares .",
    "the dotted lines indicate the upper and lower limits of eq .",
    "( [ loup ] ) , and the dashed diagonal line is @xmath128 , corresponding to the fraction of cooperators in the fully mixed case  @xcite . the fraction of cooperators @xmath129 is seen to follow a stepped curve , with steps corresponding to @xmath130 , where @xmath131 .",
    "this is a natural consequence of eqs .",
    "( [ boundarya])-([boundaryc ] ) , where the decision boundary @xmath54 can take only discrete values .",
    "a similar picture is given for the moore neighborhood ( @xmath18 ) in the middle panel of fig .",
    "( [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , in the middle panel of fig .",
    "( [ fig5 ] ) the values of @xmath45 fall between the limits given in table [ tab1 ] for all @xmath31 as shown with solid lines .    in both cases ( i.e. with moore and von neumann neighborhoods ) cooperation",
    "is seen to persist during the whole range @xmath132 $ ] .",
    "this result differs largely from the @xmath133-curves of the spatial snowdrift game with replicator dynamics  @xcite , where the fraction of cooperators vanished at some critical @xmath134 .",
    "hence , we argue that no conclusions on the effect of spatiality on the snowdrift game can be drawn without taking into consideration the strategy evolution mechanism ; local decision - making in a restricted neighborhood yields results which are different from those resulting from the evolutionary replicator dynamics .",
    "we have also studied the equilibrium lattice configurations for various values of @xmath31 .",
    "( [ fig5 ] ) depicts the central part of the @xmath135-lattice after 1000 simulation rounds using the moore neighborhood and @xmath127 , with white pixels corresponding to cooperators and black pixels to defectors .",
    "the values of @xmath31 have been selected so that the equilibrium situation corresponds to each plateau of @xmath129 illustrated in the central panel .",
    "the observed configurations are rather polymorphic , and repeating elementary patterns like those in fig .",
    "( [ fig2 ] ) are not seen .",
    "this reflects the fact that the local equilibrium conditions can be satisfied by various configurations ; the random initial configuration and the asynchronous update then lead to irregular - looking equilibrium patterns , which vary between simulation runs .",
    "the patterns seem to be most irregular when @xmath31 is around 0.5 ; this is because then the equilibrium numbers of cooperators and defectors are close to each other , and the ways to assign strategies within local neighborhoods are most numerous . to be more exact ,",
    "there are @xmath136 ways to distribute @xmath21 cooperators in the @xmath137-neighborhood , and if e.g. @xmath138 , @xmath21 is at least @xmath139 and at most @xmath140 , maximizing the value of the binomial coefficient .",
    "hence , the ways of filling the lattice with these neighborhoods in such a way that the equilibrium conditions are satisfied everywhere are most numerous as well .",
    "we have presented a variant of the two - dimensional snowdrift game , where the strategy evolution is determined by agent decisions based on the strategies of other players within its local neighborhood .",
    "we have analyzed the lower and upper bounds for equilibrium cooperator densities with a mean - field approach as well as considering possible lattice - filling elementary configuration blocks .",
    "we have also shown with simulations that this game converges to equilibrium configurations with constant cooperator density depending on the payoff parameters , and that these densities fall within the derived limits .",
    "furthermore , the strategy configurations in the equilibrium state display interesting patterns , especially for intermediate temptation parameter values .",
    "most interestingly , the equilibrium cooperator densities differ largely from those resulting from applying the replicator dynamics  @xcite . with our strategy evolution rules",
    ", cooperation persists through the whole temptation parameter range .",
    "this illustrates that one can not draw general conclusions on the effect of spatiality on the snowdrift game without taking the strategy evolution mechanisms into consideration ",
    "this should , in principle , apply for other spatial games as well .",
    "care should especially be taken when interpreting the results of investigations on such games : the utilized strategy evolution mechanism should reflect the system under study .",
    "we argue that especially when modeling social or economic systems , there is no _ a priori _ reason to assume that generalized conclusions can be drawn based on results using the evolution inspired replicator dynamics approach , where high - payoff strategies get copied and `` breed '' in proportion to their fitness . as we have shown here , local decision - making with limited information ( neighbor strategies are known payoffs are not ) can result in different outcome ."
