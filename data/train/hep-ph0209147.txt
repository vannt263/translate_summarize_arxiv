    "<S> we compare three different methods to evaluate uncertainties in the earth s matter density profile , which are relevant to long baseline experiments , such as neutrino factories .    </S>",
    "<S> tum - hep-477/02 +    it is generally believed that neutrino oscillations are influenced by the presence of matter  @xcite . especially , for very long baseline experiments , such as often proposed for neutrino factories , matter effects can be quite substantial . </S>",
    "<S> the knowledge on the matter density profile along a certain baseline through the earth s mantle is limited to about @xmath0 precision ( for a summary , see , e.g. , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , matter density uncertainties can affect the measurement of the neutrino oscillation parameters , such as the cp phase @xmath1  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> there have been several approaches to model the matter density uncertainties and check their influence on neutrino oscillations  @xcite . in this talk </S>",
    "<S> , we especially focus on three different techniques and show their advantages and disadvantages where applicable . based on these techniques </S>",
    "<S> , we will finally comment on the relevance of matter density uncertainties compared to other problems .     </S>",
    "<S> the different models for matter density uncertainties used in this presentation for a baseline length of @xmath2 : a single perturbation ( left ) , random fluctuations ( middle ) , and the mean density as measured quantity ( right).,width=491 ]    figure  [ ourmodels ] shows the models for matter density uncertainties used in this presentation . </S>",
    "<S> the left - hand plot illustrates a single perturbation of the average matter density , such as it could come from a mine , mountain , or lake . </S>",
    "<S> the middle plot shows random fluctuations , which can be used to model realistic fluctuations known from geophysics . </S>",
    "<S> the right - hand plot illustrates the technique of measuring the average matter density , i.e. , the density difference @xmath3 between the average matter density from the prem profile  @xcite and the actual average density is measured as an additional quantity by the neutrino oscillation experiment .    as indicated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ourmodels ] ( left ) , a single perturbation could be modeled as a bump with a length scale @xmath4 and an amplitude @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> a general result is that the relative error in the appearance probability of a neutrino factory is smaller than about @xmath6 for applications such as coal mines and lakes with a length scale @xmath7 and a density contrast @xmath8  @xcite ( for the oscillation parameters , we choose , if not otherwise stated , the lma solution , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> analytically , one can show with perturbation theory that the change in the probabilities is proportional to the product @xmath11  @xcite .    in geophysics , uncertainties in the matter density profile up to 5 % </S>",
    "<S> have been documented . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , there is no general agreement among the geophysics results . </S>",
    "<S> however , one can easily observe common characteristics of measurements in certain depths  ( see , e.g. , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , such as the length scales and amplitudes of the fluctuations . with the random density fluctuations method we model the matter density uncertainties based on their characteristics and average over a large number of random matter density profiles in order to estimate the average effects  @xcite . as indicated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ ourmodels ] ( middle plot ) , we introduce two different parameters , which are again the length scale @xmath4 and the amplitude @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> these we allow to vary around their average values with gaussian distributions with standard deviations @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively . from geophysics maps , we can estimate the parameter values : @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 . as the most interesting result </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the errors in the appearance probabilities qualitatively behave as the ones for a single perturbation , i.e. , they are essentially proportional to the product of the length scale and the amplitude . however , because of averaging effects , they are suppressed by a factor of about two to three . </S>",
    "<S> note that they are not necessarily completely averaging out because of interference effects : it is easy to show that the quantum mechanical evolution operators in different density layers do not commute . </S>",
    "<S> analytically , one can again show with perturbation theory that fast fluctuations on length scales much shorter than the oscillation length in matter average out for limited amplitudes  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a different approach is to assume the mean density to be known with about @xmath18 precision and to measure it , within these limits , together with the other neutrino oscillation parameters by the experiment ( cf . </S>",
    "<S> , fig .  [ ourmodels ] , right plot ) . </S>",
    "<S> this method can be applied to a full statistical neutrino factory analysis , such as it is done in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for an initial and advanced stage neutrino factory , respectively , at a baseline length of @xmath19 ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 target power , @xmath22 and @xmath23 running time , @xmath24 and @xmath25 detector mass , respectively ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , it should be noted that this method in many cases only allows a quite conservative estimate , since it does not take into account averaging effects among more than one density layer . as the main result of this method , </S>",
    "<S> the effects of the matter density uncertainties are most important for the measurement of the cp phase at the advanced stage at a neutrino factory . for the measurement of @xmath26 , many other experimental issues , such as the efficiencies at low energies , are of comparable magnitude .    </S>",
    "<S> let us summarize the individual approaches . </S>",
    "<S> the single perturbation method can be evaluated analytically on the level of oscillation probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> the relative errors are proportional to the product @xmath27 and no averaging effects enter this result . </S>",
    "<S> the errors are small for lakes , mountains , mines , etc </S>",
    "<S> . , and the method has only limited applications . the random fluctuations approach can be used numerically on the level of neutrino oscillation probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> the errors on the neutrino oscillation probabilities are qualitatively proportional to the product of @xmath4 and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> since there are averaging effects , they are , however , suppressed by a factor of about two or three compared to the single perturbation . for large enough structures , such as for tectonic plates or realistic fluctuations in the earth s mantle </S>",
    "<S> , the impact on the results can be much larger than the one of a single perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> one problem is the high computational effort , which means that it is hard to apply this method in a complete statistical analysis . </S>",
    "<S> however , in the limit of large enough @xmath28 , the next method provides a good approximation : the mean density as measured quantity approach can be used in a complete statistical analysis , which needs to be performed numerically . </S>",
    "<S> the errors on the neutrino oscillation probabilities can then be directly translated into the errors on the quantities to be measured by the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> especially , a cp phase measurement can be substantially affected by matter density uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> averaging and interference effects of matter density fluctuations are , however , not directly modeled by this method . in this context , assuming a @xmath0 error on the average matter density should be a rather conservative estimate , since averaging effects are completely neglected .    </S>",
    "<S> we have seen that there can be quite substantial effects of matter density uncertainties in a complete statistical analysis . </S>",
    "<S> however , we have demonstrated that these are partially reduced by averaging in a more realistic random fluctuations model . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we may expect that the effects in a complete analysis are smaller than for the conservative estimate of the measured average matter density . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the information on the matter density profile along a specific baseline from geophysics should be much better than assumed here , since at least a part of the terrain in lower depths should be well - known and the existing information could be combined for higher depths . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , matter density uncertainties are only relevant for a very advanced neutrino factory experiment to be built at a time when geophysics research has also been advancing . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that matter density uncertainties will probably not be the bottleneck of the statistical analysis of a planned experiment , though somewhat more effort should be spent on improving the results from geophysics .    </S>",
