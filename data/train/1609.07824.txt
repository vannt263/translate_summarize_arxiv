    "galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) play a crucial role in constraining stellar evolutionary models as well as galactic chemical evolution .",
    "recently , many of these clusters have been the subject of large - scale photometric surveys using deep , high resolution multi - colour space - based observations @xcite . however , ggcs located towards the galactic bulge , despite their importance as the most metal - rich ( and in some cases , massive ) members of the ggc system , have been generally excluded from these surveys due to severe total and differential extinction at optical wavelengths . for this reason , infrared wavelengths , where the effects of extinction are greatly reduced ( @xmath6@xmath7@xmath8 ; @xcite ) , are ideal for photometric investigations of such clusters .",
    "the _ vista variables in the via lactea _ ( vvv ) , an eso public survey , has observed a 562 sq .",
    "degree field including the galactic bulge and a portion of the disk in @xmath9 filters down to @xmath10@xmath720 , and thus presents an ideal opportunity to study the ggcs located in the survey area . since the advent of near - ir arrays , a wealth of effort has been devoted to studying ggcs in the near - infrared largely by valenti , ferraro and collaborators ( e.g.  @xcite , valenti et al .",
    "2010 , hereafter @xcite ; also see @xcite and references therein ) , in addition to the earlier studies of @xcite and @xcite which employed photometry from the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; @xcite ) . an important goal of these investigations was the construction of relations between observable features in cluster near - ir colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) and their chemical abundances , as these relations can then be applied to obtain photometric metallicity estimates . with an eye towards future application for distant and/or heavily extincted stellar systems ,",
    "we revisit these calibrations .",
    "this is advantageous in light of not only the quality of the vvv photometry , but more importantly its wide - field nature , facilitating a statistical assessment of contamination by field stars ( see sect .",
    "[ decontbigsect ] ) , leveraged together with improved spectroscopic abundances ( see sect .",
    "[ badfehsect ] ) and reddening maps ( e.g.  @xcite ; see sect .",

    "the resulting relations between distance- and reddening - independent photometric features measured from near - ir cluster cmds versus cluster metallicities are further optimized by concatenating the results presented here with those available in the literature .    in the next section",
    ", we present the details of our observations and data processing , including corrections for differential reddening and field star contamination , and the resulting cluster cmds . in sect .  3",
    ", we describe our methodology for measuring cluster photometric features as well as their uncertainties , and in sect .",
    "4 we use these measurements , along with literature values , to construct relations which can be used to estimate metallicities of old stellar populations photometrically . in the final section",
    "we summarize our results , discussing implications for clusters with controversial metallicity values .",
    "there are 36 galactic globular clusters ( ggcs ) presently known in the area covered by the vvv survey according to the catalog of harris ( 1996 , 2010 revision , hereafter @xcite ) , plus one candidate discovered as a result of this survey ( vvv cl001 , * ? ? ?",
    "we aim to derive relations between observed photometric parameters on the cluster red giant branches ( rgbs ) , where the most ir - bright cluster members lie , and cluster metallicities ( in terms of both @xmath1}$ ] and @xmath2}$ ] ) , so we have selected a subset of the ggcs in the vvv survey area which all have spectroscopically measured @xmath1}$ ] values . to restrict our sample to only those clusters with high quality @xmath1}$ ] measurements , we consider only clusters with a value of `` 1 '' in the last column of table a.1 in carretta et al .",

    "2014 , hereafter @xcite ) , comprising a sample of 17 ggcs from vvv including photometry of ngc 6544 described in @xcite .",
    "we return to the issue of various spectroscopic metallicities for the target clusters in sect .",
    "[ badfehsect ] , and the use of literature measurements for additional clusters is discussed in sect .",
    "[ baselinesect ] .",
    "the images which we employ were obtained as part of the vvv survey using the 4.1 m visible and infrared survey telescope for astronomy ( vista ) , equipped with the vircam ( vista infrared camera ) instrument @xcite .",
    "the vircam detector consists of a 4@xmath114 array of chips , each with 2048x2048 pixels and a pixel scale of 0.339@xmath12 per pixel .",
    "a description of the survey can be found in @xcite , with further details regarding the survey strategy and data products in @xcite .",
    "information regarding the first data release , including products which we employ here , is given in @xcite .",
    "point - spread - function fitting ( psf ) photometry is performed on vvv images obtained from the cambridge astronomical survey unit ( casu ) via the iterative usage of the daophot / allframe suite @xcite identically to previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this psf photometry pipeline has been customized to operate on preprocessed , stacked vvv images produced by casu , and the reader is referred to @xcite for a detailed description of the psf photometry pipeline and comparisons with other data reduction techniques and products .",
    "we have chosen to perform photometric and astrometric calibration of the resulting catalogs to 2mass for two reasons .",
    "first , because our photometry becomes saturated below the tip of the rgbs of all of our target clusters , merging our photometric catalogs with 2mass is necessary in order to construct fiducial sequences and luminosity functions ( lfs ) over the entire luminosity range of the cluster rgbs and measure photometric features ( described in sect .  [ anasect ] ) .",
    "second , by performing our analysis in the 2mass photometric system , our results may be directly compared and/or combined with previous near - ir studies , the majority of which have been calibrated to 2mass as well @xcite . to calibrate our photometry and astrometry to the 2mass @xmath0 system",
    ", a magnitude range is selected among the stars matched between vvv and the 2mass point source catalog in which both datasets show good agreement with minimal scatter , avoiding stars which are sufficiently faint so as to be unduly affected by crowding and/or large photometric errors in 2mass .",
    "additionally , stars with neighbors detected within 2.2@xmath12 contributing a contaminating flux of @xmath130.03 mag are rejected from use as local standards ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "instrumental magnitudes resulting from psf photometry are calibrated to the 2mass @xmath0 system ( rather than the native vista filter system ) using the classical transformation equations of the form @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a photometric zeropoint offset and @xmath16 is a linear colour term .",
    "the coefficients @xmath15 and @xmath16 are obtained independently for each vircam chip per image per filter using least squares fitting , but using a weighting scheme to downweight discrepant data points rather than a sigma clipping or rejection procedure . for the coefficients @xmath15 and @xmath16 , the values measured in each of the three ( @xmath17 ) filters are @xmath15=(0.62,0.26,-0.52)@xmath18(0.04,0.03,0.06 ) and @xmath16=(0.03,-0.02,-0.02)@xmath18(0.02,0.02,0.02 ) , compared to median fitting uncertainties @xmath190.02 for the offset @xmath15 and @xmath190.01 for the colour term @xmath16 in all three bandpasses .",
    "thus , the resulting photometric calibrations have 1@xmath20 zeropoint uncertainties of @xmath50.02 mag for all target clusters , and a star by star comparison between our calibrated photometry and 2mass in all three @xmath0 filters is shown in fig .",
    "[ comp2mass ] .",
    "all stars matched between vvv and 2mass are shown in grey in each panel of fig .",
    "[ comp2mass ] , and the subset of these stars used for calibration is overplotted . the vertical dashed line in each panel of fig .",
    "[ comp2mass ] indicates the magnitude at which the vvv photometry is unusable due to saturation , which varies somewhat from cluster to cluster due to differences in stellar crowding as well as observing conditions . for stars which are brighter than this limit in any of the three @xmath0 filters ,",
    "we supplement our vvv catalogs with photometry from the 2mass point source catalog ( psc ) .",
    "all colours and magnitudes which we report in this study are in the 2mass photometric system ( rather than the native vista system ) , and additional discussions regarding the calibration of vvv photometry to the 2mass system can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "astrometric calibration is performed to the coordinates given in the 2mass psc , using the world coordinate system information placed in the headers of the stacked vvv images by casu as an initial guess in order to correct for effects of geometric distortion .",
    "the resulting astrometry has a root mean square ( rms ) precision of @xmath70.2@xmath12 for all target clusters , in accord with the astrometric precision of 2mass .      of our target clusters , 13 of 16",
    "are also included in the compilation of @xcitegc / ir_archive ] .",
    "we calculate the mean magnitude differences in each filter between our photometry and theirs using a weighted 2.5@xmath20 clip in magnitude bins , employing only unsaturated stars brightward of the observed lf peak .",
    "the resulting comparisons of magnitude difference as a function of magnitude are shown for each cluster in fig .",
    "[ compv04 ] . given our photometric zeropoint uncertainty of @xmath210.02 mag and the zeropoint uncertainty of 0.05 mag estimated by @xcite ,",
    "the two studies , having both been calibrated to 2mass , are generally in good agreement . while larger offsets are seen in a few cases ( ngc 6528 , ngc 6553 , ngc 6638 , ngc 6642 ) , the direct comparison with 2mass in fig .",
    "[ comp2mass ] gives no reason to be doubtful about the calibration of these clusters .",
    "specifically , the mean magnitude offset between the vvv and 2mass photometry ( weighted by the inverse square of their total photometric uncertainties ) over the magnitude range of stars used for calibration is @xmath210.016 mag in @xmath22 and @xmath10 and @xmath210.023 mag in @xmath23 for these four clusters ( these mean differences are @xmath210.02 mag for all other clusters in all bandpasses as well ) .",
    "photometric analysis of ggcs towards the galactic bulge can be severely hampered by contamination from field stars in the bulge and disk , particularly in cases where bulge and disk contaminants are inseparable from the cluster evolutionary sequences using colour - magnitude criteria alone .",
    "statistical field star decontamination methods which compare the colour - magnitude loci of cluster and field stars generally rely on the assumption that reddening is spatially invariant ( see sect .",
    "[ decontsect ] below ) , so before undertaking analyses of the ggc photometry , we first correct for differential reddening and then apply a statistical field star decontamination procedure .",
    "we correct our photometric catalog of each cluster for reddening only in a strictly differential sense ( we do not correct for _ total _ line of sight extinction ) .",
    "this is done using the reddening maps of @xcite , adopting the value of @xmath24 corresponding to the location of the cluster center as a reference zeropoint for the differential reddening corrections over the spatial area of each cluster .",
    "this reference value is given as @xmath25 in table [ tab : cleanparams ] .",
    "the photometric catalog for each cluster is then corrected for reddening variations over the field of view using the _ difference _ between the value of @xmath24 at a given spatial location and @xmath25 ( i.e.  the value at the spatial location of the cluster center ) . however , since the @xcite maps were constructed by measuring the variation in the @xmath26 colour of the galactic bulge red clump ( rc ) as a function of spatial location , the number statistics necessary to reliably measure the bulge rc colour restrict the spatial resolution of the @xcite maps to @xmath271 arcmin , while significant differential reddening towards bulge ggcs can occur on spatial scales of arcseconds @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the @xcite maps were constructed from aperture photometry catalogs rather than psf photometry , and therefore suffer from crowding and incompleteness significantly brightward of their detection limits as compared to psf photometry ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* see their fig .",
    "therefore , where available , we have combined the @xcite maps of the field surrounding each cluster with high spatial resolution reddening maps ( constructed using cluster stars ) of the central region of the cluster .",
    "the high resolution maps were taken from @xcite where available ( 8 clusters ) , from @xcite in the case of ngc 6544 , and for 6 more clusters , we employ maps similarly constructed from archival optical hst imaging described in detail elsewhere ( r.  e.  cohen et al .",
    ", in prep.)10@xmath12 . ] .",
    "while the high resolution maps are generally restricted to the inner regions of the target clusters where the membership probability is high , we note that they extend well beyond the cluster half - light radii from the harris ( 1996 , 2010 revision , hereafter @xcite ) catalog , encompassing the majority of cluster members versus a half - light radius of 2.15@xmath28 from @xcite , although this value may not be too reliable as this cluster is core - collapsed @xcite . ] .",
    "these high - resolution maps are also applied in a strictly differential sense , relative to @xmath25 , but we must take into account that the differential reddening corrections given by the @xcite maps may not be referred to the same differential reddening zeropoint ( i.e.  the cluster center ) . therefore , we shift the @xcite corrections to refer to our reference value of @xmath25 ( i.e.  the @xcite value at the cluster center ) by comparing , for all stars within the radius permitted by the @xcite maps , the @xmath29 colour obtained after performing the @xcite correction with that resulting from the @xcite correction .",
    "this yields the mean difference @xmath30@xmath24 ( and standard deviation ) between the two maps , given in table [ tab : cleanparams ] for clusters in our sample with high resolution maps from @xcite .",
    "for the two target clusters with no available high spatial resolution reddening maps ( ngc 6569 and ngc 6638 ) , we employ only the @xcite maps , noting that they predict quite modest differential reddening over the entire sampled area in both cases ( @xmath30@xmath310.065 ) .",
    "we clean our differential reddening corrected cluster cmds of field stars using a statistical technique detailed in @xcite , including recent improvements described by @xcite .",
    "the application of this technique to vvv psf photometry is described in @xcite , but can be summarized as follows : two spatial regions are selected , the first being the spatial region to be decontaminated ( over which high spatial resolution differential reddening maps are available ) which has area @xmath32 and a total number of stars @xmath33 in the magnitude range considered for decontamination ( see below ) . the second area is the comparison ( e.  g.  field ) region , which has area @xmath34 , which we have chosen to have an inner radius equal to the cluster @xcite tidal radii1.90@xmath28 and 1.55@xmath28 respectively from the cluster center , corresponding to more than twice the @xcite half - light radii in both cases . ] . to statistically decontaminate the cluster region , the cmd of the cluster region",
    "is compared to the cmd of the comparison region by dividing their cmds into a three - dimensional grid of cells in @xmath35 .",
    "the effects of photometric incompleteness are minimized by including only stars which lie brightward of the observed cluster area lf peak @xmath36 . in each cmd cell of the cluster region ,",
    "the number of field stars to be removed is calculated by summing the probability density distributions of all comparison field stars in the analogous cmd cell , corrected for the ratio of cluster to comparison field areas .",
    "this number of stars , rounded to the nearest integer , are randomly removed from the cluster region cmd cell , and the entire procedure is repeated over @xmath37=729 iterations in which the cell sizes and locations are varied to mitigate the effects of binning .",
    "the mean number of surviving cluster stars @xmath38 is calculated over all iterations , stars are sorted by their survival frequency , and cluster stars are retained in order of decreasing survival frequency until this mean number of surviving cluster stars is reached .",
    "the efficiency of this field star decontamination procedure may be gauged using the subtraction efficiency @xmath39 , which is the fraction of ( decimal ) stars to be subtracted ( based on the stellar density of the comparison field and the ratio of comparison to cluster field area ) to the actual ( integer ) number of probable field stars removed from the cluster region . to attain the highest possible subtraction efficiencies , the comparison regions generally consist of an annulus wide enough that @xmath34 is many times larger than @xmath32 .",
    "a large comparison region has the added advantage that any small - scale variations in the stellar density of the comparison field are averaged out , as the comparison regions we employ have typical areas @xmath410@xmath40 arcmin@xmath41 .",
    "however , especially given the relatively large ( @xmath730@xmath28 ) tidal radii of some of our target clusters , in practice an upper limit to the size of the comparison region is necessary due to several factors .",
    "these include the proximity of other nearby features not representative of the cluster line of sight such as other globular and open clusters , and in the case of m69 , proximity to the edge of the vvv survey area over which photometry is available .",
    "the values of @xmath33 , @xmath38 , the ratio of comparison to cluster region areas @xmath34/@xmath32 , the total comparison region area @xmath34 , the subtraction efficiency @xmath39 and the faint magnitude limit @xmath36 are given for all of our target clusters , including results for ngc 6544 from @xcite which we add to our sample , in table [ tab : cleanparams ] , along with formal uncertainties which take into account both photometric errors and poissonian uncertainties of the total number of stars in the cluster and comparison regions .",

    "[ tcd ] .",
    "third , both agb and rgb stars are often photometrically variable , so that even when an agb star has a colour and/or magnitude which is separable from the rgb _ in the mean _ , it may coincide with the rgb at some pulsational phases .",

    "on one hand , fig .",
    "4 of @xcite as well as the results of @xcite suggest that variability amplitude decreases with decreasing luminosity , although with a relatively small sample size and sparse time sampling , the evolutionary state of any individual case may still be unclear .",

    ", @xcite found that a significant fraction of the variables below the trgb are rgb rather than agb stars .",
    "in addition , @xcite managed to efficiently separate rgb and agb stars below the trgb using detailed pulsational properties , revealing that rgb ( e.g.  non - agb ) pulsators tend to have almost exclusively short primary periods ( p@xmath560d ; see their fig .",
    "8) and small pulsational amplitudes ( @xmath69@xmath210.14 mag ) .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite discuss the difficulty of separating agb and rgb stars using pulsational properties . while small - amplitude variables below the trgb appear to be dominated by rgb stars _ in a statistical sense _",

    "the time series aspect of vvv imaging unfortunately can not provide any clues with respect to our target cluster trgbs , as our vvv psf photometry saturates @xmath271 magnitude below the trgb .",
