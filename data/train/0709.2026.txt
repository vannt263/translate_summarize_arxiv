    "we will show that only very few candidate surface branched covers induce candidate covers between hyperbolic triangular 2-orbifolds :      this result means that the geometric techniques employed above would require a substantial extension to be relevant for the hyperbolic case . leaving this for the future",

    "we have @xmath654 and it is impossible to find partitions of @xmath655 inducing the candidate cover , because the cone point of order 2 in @xmath58 , being covered by ordinary points of @xmath72 only , should require a partition consisting of @xmath9 s only , which can not exist because @xmath655 is odd .    carrying out the same analysis one gets the last two items in the statement for @xmath656 , the seventh item for @xmath657 , and nothing new for the other @xmath58 s . this concludes step iii and the proof .",

    "the two marked germs of edges can not be joined together or to the 1-valent vertex , so they go either to the same 3-valent vertex as in ( aa ) or to different 3-valent vertices as in ( ab ) .",
    "case ( aa ) is impossible because there is a region with 7 vertices , which will become more than 7 in the complete dessin . in case ( ab )",
    "we examine where the marked germ of edge could go , getting cases ( aba ) to ( abd ) , always redrawn in a more convenient way .",
    "cases ( aba ) and ( abb ) are impossible because of long regions . in cases ( abc ) and ( abd )",
    "we examine where the marked edge could go in order not to create regions of length 5 or longer than 7 , and we see that in both cases there is only one possibility , namely ( abca ) and ( abda ) . in both these cases , because of the region of length already 6 , the two marked germs of edges should go to one and the same 3-valent vertex , but there are no more available with two free germs of edges , so again we can not complete the dessin in order to realize ( 8) .",
