    "although the kondo effect is enhanced , when the anderson - hubbard system approaches the critical point , this effect is completely suppressed right at the transition , and all charge fluctuations are suppressed .",
    "even though the exact diagonalization on chains does not reproduce this result , we believe that the gutzwiller method describes correctly the scenario in higher dimensional systems , and the different behavior found for linear chains is simply a consequence of the anomalies of low - dimensional systems .",

    "<S> two methods are used : ( i ) variational calculation with the gutzwiller wave function optimizing numerically the ground - state energy and ( ii ) exact diagonalization of the hamiltonian for short chains . the @xmath0-level occupancy and the renormalization factor of the quasiparticles </S>",
    "<S> are calculated as a function of the energy of the @xmath0-orbital for a wide range of the interaction parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained by the two methods are in reasonably good agreement for the periodic anderson model . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement is maintained even when the interaction between band electrons , @xmath1 , is taken into account , except for the half - filled case . </S>",
    "<S> this discrepancy can be explained by the difference between the physics of the one- and higher dimensional models . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this interaction shifts and widens the energy range of the bare @xmath0-level , where heavy - fermion behavior can be observed . </S>",
    "<S> for large enough @xmath1 this range may lie even above the bare conduction band . </S>",
    "<S> the gutzwiller method indicates a robust transition from kondo insulator to mott insulator in the half - filled model , while @xmath1 enhances the quasi - particle mass when the filling is close to half filling . </S>"
