    "consider , for instance , unitaries of the form @xmath28 and @xmath29 , for small @xmath30 we find @xmath31 is very close to the diamond distance .",

    "the algorithm behaves qualitatively the same for different @xmath163 settings , assuming @xmath166 .",
    "the algorithm has two important properties that we discuss below , leaving technical details until the appendices . the basic geometric intuition behind the algorithm is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ simplexfig ] .    first , for all @xmath167 found by the algorithm we have @xmath168 which we show in app .",

    "this gives the upper bound stated in thm .",
    "[ genthm ] .",
    "the second important property of the algorithm is that it eventually terminates .",
    "each @xmath157 is distinct , and in particular its @xmath159 falls outside the convex hull of previous points ( see app .",
    "[ converge ] for proof ) .",
    "if we further assume that there are a finite number of distinct points with bounded resource cost , then there are only a finite number of possible @xmath157 for the algorithm to output .",
    "since each is distinct , the algorithm must terminate in a finite number of steps .",
    "the additional assumption of a finite number of suitable point is very mild , at satisfied both for the clifford+@xmath1 gate set and also any gate set where all gates have non - zero cost .",
    "furthermore , below we see that the algorithm need not terminate , but that sufficient iterations will work equally well",
    ".    a finite number of steps may still be very many , but we have evidence the converge is very fast .",
    "first we note that in a @xmath42-dimensional space , a simplex of @xmath172 will suffice to enclose a nontrivial volume . though the algorithm is not ensured to converge in @xmath172 steps",
    ", it may often do so .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ simplexfig ] , the analogous setup in euclidean geometry hints that it will always find an enclosing simplex in @xmath172 iterations , though it is unclear whether this carries over to the topology induced by the operator norm .",
    "we can be more quantitative by considering the quantity @xmath154 , which measures the distance from the convex hull . recall that the convex hull finding algorithm halts when @xmath173 .",
    "further evidence of rapid convergence is that @xmath154 decreases exponentially fast . specifically , we find there exists a @xmath174 such that @xmath175 so the convergence toward zero is exponentially fast . even exponentially small @xmath154 may be nonzero , but once @xmath176 the preceding proofs can be adapted to account for nonzero @xmath154 with negligible influence on the upper bounds .",
    "all convergence proof details are given in app .",
    "[ converge ] .",
    "we now consider a setting where the target @xmath18 is an axial rotation of a single qubit .",
    "the only assumption we make about the generating gate set is that it contains pauli @xmath60 as a free resource . given a protocol for axial - synthesis , for all such @xmath18 and any @xmath46 there exists at least one @xmath147 such that @xmath177 and where @xmath147 has cost not exceeding @xmath73 for some @xmath70 .",
    "recall that @xmath70 is polylogarithmic in @xmath178 .",
    "for instance , the ross - selinger algorithm satisfies the worst case bound @xmath179 , and @xmath180 on average",
    ". it will prove useful to consider @xmath181 and expand in the pauli basis @xmath182 we say @xmath147 is an over - rotation if @xmath183 and an under - rotation if @xmath184 .",
    "we require a second unitary @xmath185 such that the pair @xmath186 contains one over - rotation and one under - rotation .",
    "for the second rotation , we will use the pauli expansion @xmath187 gate - synthesis only ensures one unitary such that @xmath177 , but a suitable @xmath185 can be found only slightly further away .",
    "specifically , there must exist a suitable @xmath185 with cost below @xmath52 . to verify this , one constructs an axial rotation @xmath188 with @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "unitary gate synthesis must then provide a @xmath191 within @xmath2 of @xmath188 , such that @xmath192 .",
    "furthermore , within the same cost budget we can synthesize unitaries @xmath193 and @xmath194 , with @xmath195 considering the set @xmath196 it follows immediately that they satisfy condition ( 1 ) of lem .  [ mainlem ] with @xmath197 .",
    "next , we assign them weights @xmath198 where @xmath199 will be fixed later .",
    "the linear combination is @xmath200 subtracting the identity and taking the operator - norm squared , @xmath201 we now fix @xmath202 to eliminate the second term .",
    "considering the variables @xmath203 , @xmath204 one is positive ( an over - rotation ) and the other negative ( an under - rotation ) , so zero sits within the convex hull of these variables and suitable @xmath202 can be found .",

    "similarly , from @xmath219 we can infer @xmath220 .",
    "substituting into eq .",
    ", we have @xmath221 therefore , we have demonstrated both the necessary conditions of lem .",
    "[ mainlem ] with @xmath222 and @xmath223 . applying the lemma ,",
    "our channel satisfies @xmath224 a smaller factor than 5 is likely to be provable .",
    "we have seen that resource costs of fault - tolerant quantum computing can be reduced by switching to a randomised approach to gate - synthesis .",
    "it may seem counterintuitive that a randomisation process can be advantageous .",
    "however , convexity of the diamond distance naturally entails that mixing over channels of similar noise levels can only reduce the noise .",
    "we presented a convex hull finding algorithm for finding the suitable mixing ratios . while this algorithm is exponentially fast , it is plausible that a constant time algorithm exists .",
    "we suspect that a variant of delaunay triangulation could be used to quickly identify a suitable simplex",
    ". however , our literature search on delaunay triangulation has only found results on euclidean space and we have yet to ascertain if such tools carry over to the operator norm topology .",
    "this work has only considered mixing over unitary channels , which prompts the question whether more general quantum channels might be useful .",
    "probabilistic quantum circuits with fallback  @xcite is an approach to gate - synthesis that is not entirely unitary , though it makes use of an ancillary qubit and works very differently to the approach presented here .",
    "as remarked earlier , mixing can be useful in preparation of different magic states  @xcite .",
    "we ponder whether all these approaches can be understood within a single framework of quantum channel synthesis .",

    "<S> fault - tolerant quantum computers compose elements of a discrete gate set in order to approximate a target unitary . </S>",
    "<S> the problem of minimising the number of gates is known as gate - synthesis . </S>",
    "<S> the approximation error is a form of coherent noise , which can be significantly more damaging than comparable incoherent noise . </S>",
    "<S> we show how mixing over different gate sequences can convert this coherent noise into an incoherent form . </S>",
    "<S> as measured by diamond distance , the post - mixing noise is quadratically smaller than before mixing , with no additional resource cost . </S>",
    "<S> equivalently , we can use a shorter gate sequence to achieve the same precision as unitary gate - synthesis , with a factor @xmath0 reduction for a broad class of problems .    </S>",
    "<S> the constraints of fault - tolerant quantum computing mean that the available quantum gates form a discrete set . </S>",
    "<S> such a gate set is said to be universal if it generates a group that gives a dense cover over all unitaries . </S>",
    "<S> that is , any target unitary can be approximated to any desired level of precision with a sufficiently long sequence of gates . </S>",
    "<S> the solovay - kitaev  @xcite theorem ensures that whenever we have a universal gate set , we can achieve a circuit depth that is poly - logarithmic in the inverse precision . </S>",
    "<S> the solovay - kitaev theorem is a very powerful and general result , but in practice yields very long gate sequences . </S>",
    "<S> remarkable progress beyond solovay - kitaev has been made in recent years by focusing on gate - sets that naturally arise in fault - tolerant quantum computing , in particular the clifford+@xmath1 gate set , with the flourishing topic becoming known as gate - synthesis  @xcite .    a common feature of both new and old approaches to gate - synthesis is the approximation of the target unitary with a different unitary . </S>",
    "<S> then the approximation error is a form of coherent noise , which has attracted attention as being especially pernicious to quantum computations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has , however , been observed several times that mixing over equivalent circuits can average out coherent noise into less damaging incoherent noise  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , when the individual gates suffer from coherent noise , randomized compiling has been shown to quadratically reduce this noise source  @xcite . in the context of gate synthesis </S>",
    "<S> , the approximation error appears even when the components of our gate set are perfect , and so a different approach is required .    </S>",
    "<S> here we give the first general set of tools for mixing out the approximation errors in gate synthesis . quantifying this noise by the diamond norm </S>",
    "<S> , we find our approach reduces noise from @xmath2 to @xmath3 , without increasing circuit depth or any other metric of resource cost . alternatively </S>",
    "<S> , we can achieve @xmath4 noise with reduced resource cost . </S>",
    "<S> if the resource cost of unitary gate - synthesis scales as @xmath5 , then using quantum channels @xmath2 noise can be attained with resource cost @xmath6 in the small @xmath2 limit . </S>",
    "<S> many recent gate - synthesis algorithms have @xmath7 scaling , and so in these setting we cut costs in half . </S>",
    "<S> this is an extension of the notion of magic state dilution in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , but here applied to synthesis of operations , rather than states . </S>",
    "<S> when completing this work , some similar insights were reported by hastings  @xcite , though without the explicit convex hull finding algorithm provided here . </S>"
