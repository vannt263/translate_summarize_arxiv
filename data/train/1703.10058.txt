    "<S> their effects on molecular , organismal and population level dynamics have been explored in detail , both experimentally and theoretically  @xcite . however , corresponding stochasticity in the _ timing _ of key cellular events , whose statistics are governed by fluctuating copy numbers , has not received comparable attention  @xcite . in part , this is due to experimental challenges in obtaining high quality time - series data which are amenable to analysis for timing noise : this requires _ in vivo _ measurements at the individual - cell level . </S>",
    "<S> increasingly , this challenge is being overcome through rapid development of live single - cell imaging technologies  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> an outstanding question in the context of stochastic biological timekeeping is how specific time ordering of key cellular events is achieved , given that underlying biochemical processes rely on noisy regulators with fluctuating outputs . </S>",
    "<S> for example , dna replication inevitably precedes cell division despite cell to cell variability in key determinants of both processes  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> important changes in cell fates are often triggered by thresholded events , i.e. , upon the attainment of a critical value of a relevant cellular dynamical variable ( e.g. , copy number of a protein )  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the question is how temporal specificity , i.e. , a tight distribution of these crossing times , is achieved despite underlying stochasticity in governing biochemical processes .    in this work </S>",
    "<S> we address this issue and show that if the _ time - integral _ of a stochastic biochemical signal is thresholded , rather than the original signal , then a dramatic improvement in temporal specificity results , provided timescales are appropriately chosen ( figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - integral ] , [ fig : trajectories ] and [ fig - osc]d ) . by motivating a natural representation for the time - integral of a stochastic process </S>",
    "<S> , we provide an analytical prescription for computing fpt distributions of time - integrated signals . </S>",
    "<S> we apply this framework to paradigmatic models of biological timekeeping , hourglass timers ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : trajectories ] ) and oscillator clocks ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - osc ] ) , and validate our premise . </S>",
    "<S> further , we show how time - integration of stochastic signals can be realized biochemically , through implementation of a simple chemical reaction scheme . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , these results reveal a mechanism by which a population of identical cells can spontaneously bifurcate into subpopulations of early and late responders , depending on hierarchy of timescales in the dynamics ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - osc ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we use these results to argue that biochemical time - integration is an attractive prescription for achieving temporal specificity in biological systems .    * _ biological timekeeping via integral thresholding . </S>",
    "<S> _ * we denote the stochastic variable representing the biological timekeeper by @xmath0 , its realization by @xmath1 , its time - dependent distribution by @xmath2 , the threshold - value by @xmath3 , the time of the first threshold crossing time by @xmath4 , and its distribution , i.e. , the first - passage - time ( fpt ) distribution , by @xmath5 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - integral ] ) . the mean value , @xmath6 , is an oscillating function of time for pendulum - clock models , and a monotonically increasing ( or decreasing ) function for hourglass - timer models ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - paradigms ] ) . the choice of stochastic model for @xmath0 will specify statistics of fluctuations around the ensemble - averaged mean - value . </S>",
    "<S> thus the issue is that despite stochasticity in @xmath0 , one must have a narrow fpt distribution , @xmath5 , to ensure temporal specificity .    </S>",
    "<S> we propose that if the stochastic time - integral , @xmath7 , is thresholded , instead of @xmath0 , then false - positives ( undesired crossing events ) and false - negatives ( missed crossing events ) will be naturally eliminated since the time - integral is always monotonically increasing function of time for any stochastic model of @xmath0 dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - integral ] . ) </S>",
    "<S> one will still have cell to cell variability in threshold crossing times , since @xmath8 s dynamics are stochastic , nevertheless temporal specificity will be dramatically improved . to test our premise </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce a framework to analytically compute the statistics of @xmath7 , for any general stochastic model of @xmath0 dynamics , and also provide a prescription for computing the first - passage - time statistics of the time - integral .    * </S>",
    "<S> _ a natural representation for the time - integral of a stochastic process . </S>",
    "<S> _ * evaluation of the statistics of the time - integral of a general stochastic process , @xmath0 , is a challenging proposition . </S>",
    "<S> however , we have found a representation for the time - integral which provides a straightforward and intuitive route to exactly evaluating its time - dependent statistics .    to physically motivate the representation </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce the `` fictitious '' stochastic variable , @xmath9 , produced through the birth process @xmath10 , with propensity @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a rate constant ; @xmath13 is the probability of observing @xmath14 r s at time @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the general stochastic model ( making no assumptions about the stochastic model governing @xmath8 dynamics ) consists of : @xmath16 we now relate the statistics of the @xmath17 variable to the statistics of the time - integral , @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> first , consider a simple limit of the problem : when @xmath1 is a ( deterministic ) constant in time , say @xmath18 , @xmath17 undergoes a simple birth process , and its distribution is poisson with mean value , @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> next , consider a slight generalization : when @xmath1 is a deterministic function of time , @xmath13 is still poisson distributed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , its mean - value , @xmath20 , becomes a _ </S>",
    "<S> functional _ of the deterministic function , @xmath1 : @xmath21 = k_{r } \\int^{t } dt ' q(t')$ ] .    for the fully stochastic case , </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath8 s dynamics are governed by a stochastic model , using the previous result , the distribution @xmath13 must be a superposition of poisson distributions , since the ensemble can be broken into subpopulations , which share the same stochastic time - course , @xmath1 , and have a corresponding poisson distribution of @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> this distribution can therefore be represented as superposition of poisson distributions with a weighting probability density , @xmath22 , which accounts for the frequency with which different trajectories , @xmath1 , arise in the stochastic model  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath23 . @xmath13 and @xmath22 uniquely determine each other , and this relation can be inverted to find @xmath22 , given @xmath13 ( which can be computed by solving the master equation for a given model for the dynamics of q ) </S>",
    "<S> however , setting @xmath24 , the poisson parameter , @xmath20 , is equal to the time - integral , @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath22 is the time - dependent distribution of the time - integral of @xmath8 ! </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the poisson representation is the natural representation for the time - integral of a stochastic process . </S>",
    "<S> it also provides an analytical route for computing its statistics .    , of a biochemical timekeeper ( orange curves ) governed by a simple birth - death process , a prototype of a stochastic hourglass timer . </S>",
    "<S> its fpt probability density ( bold teal curve ) , for crossing a standard threshold , @xmath26 , is computed by counting the fraction of trajectories crossing the threshold for the first time between times @xmath4 and @xmath27 ( teal trajectories ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) corresponding trajectories ( gray ) of the stochastic time - integral , @xmath28 , and the integral s fpt distribution ( bold teal curve ) . the integral threshold , @xmath29 , is chosen to yield the same mean - value , @xmath30 , as in ( a ) . </S>",
    "<S> evidently , thresholding the time - integral results in a significantly narrower fpt distribution , thus improving temporal specificity ( see accompanying text for quantification ) . </S>",
    "<S> all timescales are measured in units of @xmath31 ; @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we note that for specific stochastic models , we can directly write down a generalized master equation for the joint probability of @xmath35 and the density of its time - integral , @xmath36 . to elucidate this , we consider a class of stochastic models in which @xmath8 undergoes birth - death dynamics with a time - dependent birth rate : @xmath37 given a system of interest , the functional form of @xmath38 can be chosen to be consistent with the characteristic dynamics of the biochemical timekeeper ( see examples below ) . the joint probability distribution of the number @xmath35 of @xmath8 and its time integral , @xmath39 , is governed by the master equation : @xmath40 { \\nonumber}\\\\      & + k_d[(q+1)p(q+1 , { \\lambda } , t ) -   q p(q , { \\lambda } , t ) ]   -q { \\partial}_{{\\lambda}}{p(q , { \\lambda } , t)}. { \\nonumber}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the mixed generating function , @xmath41 , satisfies an analogous master equation , using which we determine @xmath42 , the moment generating function of @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , the probability generating function of @xmath2  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> once @xmath45 is found , one thus obtains an expression for @xmath43 , the probability density of @xmath46 .    * _ first - passage - time ( fpt ) statistics of the time - integral . </S>",
    "<S> _ * the fpt distribution , @xmath47 , is the distribution of times , @xmath4 , when the time - integral , @xmath46 , first passes the threshold value , @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> irrespective of the details of the stochastic model governing the dynamics of @xmath8 , its time - integral is a _ monotonically _ increasing function of time , and therefore crosses the threshold , @xmath29 , exactly once ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - integral ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we can simply relate the statistics of the time - integral to its fpt statistics  @xcite : @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> given a stochastic model for @xmath8 dynamics , one can compute the statistics of the time - integral , and its fpt time distribution .    for the class of models given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eq : birth_death ] , we find that the fpt distribution for the stochastic time - integral , @xmath25 , to cross a threshold value , @xmath3 , is given by an inverse laplace transform of its moment generating function : @xmath49.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath50 is determined from initial conditions . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , when @xmath51 , @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> + * _ applications to hourglass - timers . </S>",
    "<S> _ * as a prototype of a mechanistic model of a stochastic hourglass - timer , we model the dynamics of the biochemical timekeeper , @xmath8 , with simple birth - death dynamics , i.e. , as a simple case of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : birth_death ] ) with constant birth rate , @xmath53 . thus the mean value increases monotonically with time from @xmath54 to the steady - state value , @xmath55 : @xmath56 $ ] , with @xmath57 .    as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : trajectories ] , since the original variable and its time - integral are both stochastic , there is substantial variability in the times , @xmath4 , when their corresponding threshold values ( @xmath26 and @xmath3 respectively ) are first crossed in different realizations . </S>",
    "<S> the variability is characterized by the relative width of the fpt distribution , @xmath58 , for each thresholding scheme . for apples to apples comparisons , we constrain the mean first passage time , @xmath30 , to be the same for both cases .    for improved temporal specificity , @xmath58 should be much narrower for the integral threshold than the standard threshold . as evident in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : trajectories ] , this is true , since the coefficient of variation , i.e. , the ratio of standard deviation to mean , of the fpt for integral threshold is always less than that for the standard threshold ( also see supplementary fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , use of the integral thresholding scheme for timekeeping has the added benefit of being more robust , since there is less sensitivity to noise in the value of the threshold . to validate this , in supplementary fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s2 we show that while the variance of the fpt with standard threshold increases exponentially with the threshold value , the corresponding variance for the integral threshold increases linearly , i.e. , much less dramatically .    </S>",
    "<S> an analytical solution for the fpt probability density of the time integral , @xmath59 , is found as previously described . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a simple closed form solution for the fpt distribution of the integral ( for large threshold values ) : @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the modified bessel function of the first kind of order 0  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while the characteristic timescale of the fpt is set @xmath62 , that for the integral threshold , @xmath3 , is set by @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , if @xmath4 is rescaled by @xmath63 then the shape of the distribution is determined by the single parameter , the rescaled value of the integral threshold , @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , this distribution is unimodal , positively skewed , and has an exponential tail .    * </S>",
    "<S> _ applications to pendulum - clocks . _ * as a prototype for stochastic pendulum - clocks , we consider a model in which the stochastic timekeeper , @xmath8 , undergoes periodic oscillations on average ( see fig .  [ fig - osc ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we use eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : birth_death ] ) , with @xmath65 $ ] and @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> as desired , the mean value oscillates periodically : @xmath67 /(k_{d}^2+\\omega^2)$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> we note that @xmath68 is phase - shifted with respect to @xmath69 , and the magnitude of the phase shift is frequency dependent .    </S>",
    "<S> a rich variety of behaviors is obtained for the fpt distribution of the time integral of @xmath8 for stochastic pendulum - clocks . </S>",
    "<S> the specifics depend on the hierarchy of relevant timescales for a given set of parameters . </S>",
    "<S> first , in the limit of fast oscillations , i.e. , for @xmath70 , the effect of oscillations is washed out , and one recovers the results previously obtained for the hourglass timer , i.e. , for @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> if the threshold phase corresponds to multiples of the oscillation time - period ( a relevant scenario for systems with biological rhythms  @xcite ) , the integral threshold provides excellent temporal specificity ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - osc]d ) . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in the hourglass timer case , the fpt distribution for the integral thresholding scheme has a coefficient of variation which is much smaller than the corresponding fpt distribution for the standard threshold ( when both mean fpts are kept equal ) .    </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , a population of identical cells can spontaneously bifurcate into subpopulations of early and late responders , depending on hierarchy of timescales in the dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the fpt distribution of the time - integral of @xmath8 can become bimodal ( or multimodal ) for some choices of parameters ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - osc]c ) . </S>",
    "<S> this feature may be used by biological systems where it is beneficial to have biphasic response to a given input signal . </S>",
    "<S> this is surprising , since the result for the hourglass timer is always unimodal , the integral is a monotonically increasing function of time , and the probability density , @xmath72 , is unimodal .    physically , multimodality arises due to a bottleneck effect caused by small number fluctuations , in models with non - monotonic copy number dynamics for the biochemical timekeeper ( e.g. , the stochastic pendulum clock ) , if fluctuations relative mean are large enough to drive its numbers to zero in some realizations . </S>",
    "<S> the integral is constant or increasing slowly for these trajectories near the minimum of @xmath73 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - osc ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the next reaction is likely to be a birth event , and the integrals will increase more rapidly once the minimum is cleared , thus leading to a bifurcation of the population into early and late responders </S>",
    "<S> .    in general , increasing the integral threshold , the amplitude @xmath74 , or the frequency @xmath75 ( for small values compared to @xmath76 ) moves the distribution to the right and increases the distribution s width , the number of peaks , and their amplitudes . the width and modality of the distribution decrease as the threshold approaches an integer multiple of the integral of the mean over one period , while these increase as it departs from such values ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig - osc]c and d ) .    * </S>",
    "<S> _ biological realization and discussion . </S>",
    "<S> _ * we identify a mechanism that allows a cell to keep track of the time integral of the copy numbers of relevant biochemicals . </S>",
    "<S> we saw in the model in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : birth ] ) that a stochastic variable @xmath17 , whose birth - rate is proportion to @xmath35 , provides a natural representation for the time integral of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , for large @xmath77 , @xmath14 has the same distributions as the integral of @xmath35  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( since the poisson parameter , @xmath36 , is equal to @xmath78 , for large @xmath77 , the corresponding poisson distribution approaches a delta function , and the distribution @xmath79 approaches @xmath80 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> cells may take advantage of the integral thresholding scheme with regulatory networks in which a relatively shortly lived timekeeping biochemical , @xmath8 , increases the propensity of production of another biochemical , @xmath17 , which is much more stable ( long lived ) . </S>",
    "<S> we expect such pairs of biochemicals ( integrands and integrals ) to be ubiquitous in gene regulatory networks  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a commonly occurring example of such a pair of biochemicals is a messenger rna and its corresponding protein . </S>",
    "<S> the lifetime of a messenger rna in bacterial cells ranges from a fraction of a minute to half an hour , while the lifetime of corresponding proteins typically exceeds the generation time of the bacteria in growth phase ( order of tens of minutes)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , proteins copy numbers are effectively time - integrals of the corresponding messenger rna . given a specific model of stochastic gene expression , the fpt distribution for the average copy number of the proteins </S>",
    "<S> can be computed using the framework provided here .    </S>",
    "<S> it is has been directly observed that individual cell sizes inform when cells divide  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , though cell size growth is stochastic , it has been observed cell sizes increase strictly monotonically  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , cell size is a candidate for a time - integrated cellular variable , which is thresholded ( by an adder , timer or sizer scheme )  @xcite , to control the timing of cell division .    </S>",
    "<S> as previously remarked , the experimental challenges in obtaining high quality datasets for time - courses of individual cell dynamics have resulted in lacunae in our understanding of stochasticity in the _ timing _ of key cellular events  @xcite . </S>",
