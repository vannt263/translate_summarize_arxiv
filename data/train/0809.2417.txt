    "within the scenario of a @xmath0cdm cosmology , it has been recently recognized that if the dark matter ( dm ) dominant component is a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) , its annihilation could play a relevant role on the formation and evolution of the first baryonic objects in our universe .",
    "spolyar , freese , and gondolo ( 2008 ) noticed that during the proto ",
    "stellar phase , the cooling of the baryonic gas could be overcome by the energy deposition following the annihilation of dm concentrated in the star formation site .",
    "this is a consequence of the peculiar formation characteristics of the first stars , at the center of a minihalo whose gas cooling is dominated by the little efficient primordial chemistry ; the authors suggested that this phase ( called a _ dark star _ ) could prevent the formation of the first stars , and be a new phase of stellar evolution .",
    "iocco ( 2008 ) and freese , spolyar , and aguirre ( 2008 ) noticed that , if a star does eventually form , the process of wimp capture by scattering could be so efficient that their subsequent accumulation and annihilation inside the celestial object may provide an energy source comparable or even exceeding its nuclear luminosity .",
    "motivated by these works , iocco et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and freese et al .",
    "( 2008b , c ) have studied the early pre ",
    "ms phase , in which the baryonic structure is sustained by the annihilation of the dm accreted inside it by gravitational contraction , with the help of numerical codes .",
    "both the groups find this phase is transient , although the techniques adopted are different and the details of the treatment lead to different duration estimates ; they both conclude , however , that the collapse must continue at the end of this process , which for the sake of simplicity we call the adiabatic contraction ( _ ac _ ) phase . in iocco et al .",
    "( 2008 ) ( hereafter , i08 ) , we have also studied the pre ",
    "ms phase of these stars in presence of annihilating scattered and captured dm ( _ sc _ phase ) and followed the evolution of stellar models of different mass until the end of the helium burning , in different dm environments .",
    "we find the duration of the ms is dramatically prolonged , up to a potentially everlasting phase ( depending on the choice of parameters , see later ) : the energy released by the annihilating dm can support the core at temperatures low enough that nuclear reactions are never ignited .",
    "yoon , iocco , and akiyama ( 2008 ) and taoso et al .",
    "( 2008 ) also studied the _ sc _",
    "phase , confirming our results with different codes and carrying their analysis further .",
    "these proceedings are based on the results obtained by i08 , to which we address the reader for detailed referencing and more quantitative details : here we aim to a more qualitative description of the physical processes at the basis of this class of objects .",
    "early stars are thought to form in halos of m@xmath110@xmath2 m@xmath3 and virial temperature t@xmath410@xmath5 k at redshift z@xmath620 .",
    "the primordial , metal free composition of the gas , the absence of strong magnetic fields and turbulence make early star formation very different from the one in the older universe .",
    "simulations tell us that the result of such peculiar environment are massive ( 30 - 300 m@xmath3 ) stars that form in the very center of the halo ( accurate review and referencing in the first stars iii proceedings , 2008 ) .",
    "the collapse of the baryonic material `` pulls '' also the collisional dm towards the center , thus contributing to the build  up of a central `` spike '' of dm ; if that is indeed made of self - annihilating particles ( as wimp neutralinos are ) , its higher concentration in the center of the halo causes a huge enhancement of the annihilation term : @xmath7 with @xmath8 the local dm density , @xmath9 the neutralino mass which we take to be 100gev , @xmath10 the thermally  averaged annihilation rate .",
    "it is worth noting that this energy term depends on the self ",
    "annihilation rate , whose value can be quite safely established through cosmological arguments as @xmath11  @xmath12  s@xmath13 , see for instance a recent review on particle dm ( e.g. bertone et al . 2005 ) . a fraction ( @xmath14 ) of the whole energy",
    "is emitted in the form of neutrinos , and therefore lost by the system , whereas all the other products of annihilation can quickly thermalize inside the gas already at densities @xmath1510@xmath16#/@xmath12 , as shown by spolyar et al ( 2008 ) ; we take @xmath172/3 , a typical value for a neutralino annihilation . in order to study this peculiar object",
    "we have modified the _ padova",
    "_ stellar evolution code to take into account the energy released by dm annihilation .",
    "the initial models have been prepared as follows : @xmath18 the `` stellar '' profile ( namely the baryonic structure ) has been obtained by `` pumping '' a zero age main sequence star with an artificial energy source ( as much as permitted by the stability of our numerical code ) ; for a 100m@xmath3 star , the resulting structure is an object of radius r@xmath19=1.2@xmath2010@xmath21 cm and effective temperature @xmath225@xmath2010@xmath23  k ; @xmath24 the dm profile has been obtained in the approximation of an adiabatically contracted dm profile ( from an original nfw ) which has been matched to the baryonic structure in the center , which dictates the gravitational potential . for details on the characteristics of the halo and on the adiabatic contraction approximation",
    "used we address the reader to i08 .",
    "this adiabatically contracted dm profile represents the initial model , at the time we start our analysis : we have implemented in our code a routine which allows to follow the adiabatic contraction of the dm inside our stellar object , account for the energy released by its annihilation , and so self  consistently describe the evolution of the dm coupled to the baryons . in this way we can follow the contraction of the protostar toward the main sequence including all relevant energy sources ( gravitational , dm annihilation , and possibly nuclear ) and",
    "adopt a complete equation of state for the gas .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     for @xmath25=10@xmath26 ( at the level of the current upper limit for the spin ",
    "dependent elastic scattering cross section ( desai et al . , 2004 ) ) , and an environment density @xmath8=10@xmath27gev/@xmath12 ( a likely value achieved around the star , see figure [ fig : acphase ] ) , the energy provided by the dm annihilation inside the star is able to entirely support all our models before they get to the zams , therefore not igniting nuclear reactions .",
    "their locus on the hr diagram can be observed in figure [ fig : scphase ] , compared with their zams one .",
    "lower values of @xmath8 or @xmath25 make the dm contribution smaller , and the star can contract increasingly , thus progressively enabling the ignition of nuclear reactions .",
    "stars in the white region of the right panel of figure [ fig : acphase ] do never ignite nuclear reactions ; stars below the solid curve , in the shaded area do . the closer to the curve , the longer their lifetimes will be , as energy contribution required by nuclear burning is lower , and their chemical evolution is slower , see i08 .",
    "we have studied the effects of wimp dark matter annihilation from the late stages of stellar formation through the end of helium burning . addressing the reader to iocco et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for quantitative details , here we wish to stress the fundamental physical difference between the _ sc _ mechanism , which needs a weak process to mediate the capture and thermalization of dm particles ( and therefore the dm density profile inside the star ) , and the _ ac _ one , where the dm density profile is dictated by gravitational contraction only .",
    "the difference in the two physical processes dictates diverse characteristics for the two phases : the _ ac _ is transient , and takes place early in the pre",
    " main sequence evolution of the star , when it is almost at the proto  stellar stage .",
    "phase becomes active when the star is at the bottom of the hayashi track or later in the pre ",
    "ms evolution , and it can dramatically extend the stellar life , up to orders of magnitude more than its standard lifespan , depending on parameters .    as a note added in proof , we address the reader to a paper very similar to this one , freese et al .",
    "( 2008d ) in these proceedings ; and also to the analysis of natarajan , tan , and o shea ( 2008 ) who find results in good agreement with spolyar et al .",
