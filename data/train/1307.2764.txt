    "the search for topological superconductors which support majorana fermions ( mfs ) [ ] has attracted much theoretical and experimental studies in recent years [ ] .",
    "these studies are strongly motivated by the fact that mfs in topological superconductors are non - abelian particles and have potential applications in fault - tolerant quantum computations [ ] .",
    "recent studies have pointed out that one of the most promising ways to engineer topological superconductors is by inducing s - wave superconductivity on semiconductor wires with rashba spin - orbit coupling in the presence of external magnetic fields [ ] . this results in so - called d class topological superconductors which break time - reversal symmetry and support a single mf end state at each end of a superconducting wire [ ] .",
    "these d class topological superconductors also exhibit a number of interesting transport properties such as fractional josephson effects [ ] , resonant andreev reflections [ ] , enhanced crossed andreev reflections [ ] . so far , the search for d class topological superconductors has been one of the most important areas in the study of topological superconductors .",
    "however , according to the altland - zirnbauer symmetry classification scheme [ ] , there exist other topological superconductors which belong to different symmetry classes .",

    "the resulting superconductor is in the bdi class , which respects a time - reversal like symmetry and the particle hole symmetry and it is classified by an integer topological invariant @xmath4 [ ] . this bdi class superconductor supports two distinct topological phases distinguished by one ( @xmath3 ) and two ( @xmath1 ) mf end states at each end of the wire respectively . while the superconductor in the @xmath3 phase has almost identical transport properties as a d class topological superconductor , the @xmath1 phase exhibits several transport anomalies .",
    "particularly , in the @xmath1 phase , local andreev reflections ( ars ) are completely suppressed at the normal lead / topological superconductor interface at zero bias due to the destructive interference between the ar amplitudes induced by the two mfs .",

    "first , since the local ars compete with crossed ars due to conservation of probability , the mfs should not induce strong local ars , as in the case of d class topological superconductors .",
    "otherwise , the crossed ar amplitudes would be small . for a bdi class topological superconductor in the @xmath1 phase obtained by inducing superconductivity on a aiii class topological insulator with fermionic end states ,",
    "the suppression of local ars at zero bias is indeed quite natural .",
    "suppose that the aiii class topological insulator is in the non - trivial phase with a fermionic end state , adding a small superconducting pairing term does not close the energy gap and there is no topological phase transition .",
    "in this case , the fermionic end state can be regarded as two mf end states .",
    "therefore , we have a bdi class topological superconductor with @xmath1 . however , when the pairing terms are zero , there can not be any local ars since the system is simply an insulator .",
    "consequently , one may expect that the local ar amplitudes are strongly suppressed when the pairing amplitudes are small .",
    "the suppression of the local ar amplitudes opens up the possibility for the crossed ar amplitudes to be enhanced in the presence of finite @xmath2 .",
    "it is important to note that the suppression of local ars in the @xmath1 phase does not contradict the results of diez et al .",
    "[ ] who predicted that the conductance at zero bias should be @xmath140 at a normal lead / bdi topological superconductor junction .",
    "the reason is that the results obtained in ref .",
    "[ ] would apply only if @xmath4 is calculated using the chiral symmetry @xmath141 where @xmath34 is the particle - hole symmetry operator and @xmath142 and @xmath31 is the complex conjugate operator .",
    "this chiral symmetry @xmath143 is respected by @xmath38 of eq.2 . using this set of symmetries",
    ", one would find that the topological invariant @xmath144 equals to zero in the parameter regimes where @xmath1 and @xmath54 .",
    "moreover , @xmath145 in the regime where @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the zbc should be zero in both the @xmath54 and @xmath1 phases .",
    "this is consistent with the results by diez et al .",
    "however , the symmetry arguments alone are not enough to understand the conductance at finite voltages . in short ,",
    "the @xmath1 topological phase in this work is different from the @xmath146 phases found in previous works [ ] as a different set of symmetry operators were used to calculate the topological invariants .",
    "the suppression of local ars caused by usual fermionic andreev bound states was also studied by ioselevich and feigelman [ ] . however , resonant crossed ars can not happen in trivial superconductors due to the lack of symmetry constraints to restrict the form of the interactions among different andreev bound states .",
    "second , by definition , a aiii class topological insulator respects a chiral symmetry . as a result",
    ", a non - degenerate zero energy fermionic end state at one end of the system has to be an eigenstate of the chiral symmetry operator . for the aiii class model used in eq.1 , the chiral operator is @xmath147 .",
    "therefore , the two end states at opposite ends of the wire are eigenstates of @xmath148 with opposite eigenvalues [ ] . if there are no spin flip terms in the leads , the end states can only couple to electrons which have the same spin as the end states . using the form of the mf wavefucntions",
    ", one can show that this is true even in the presence of the pairing terms . as a result ,",
    "in the effective hamiltonian @xmath149 , one can regard the left and the right normal leads as having opposite spin .",
    "this result is important for obtaining spin - polarized currents in the leads by splitting cooper pairs .",
    "moreover , experiments on the efficient splitting of cooper pairs using coulomb blockade effect [ ] have been reported [ ] .",
    "however , the currents leaving the superconductors are not spin - polarized and it is not known whether the electrons on different leads are correlated [ ] .",
    "therefore , being able to generate correlated spin currents by splitting cooper pairs is a very unique property of the bdi class topological superconductor .",
    "finally , we discuss the stability of the topological phases which support two zero energy majorana modes on each edge of the system .",
    "as discussed above , the @xmath1 phase of the bdi class topological superconductor is protected by the chiral symmetry @xmath150 .",
    "therefore , terms such as @xmath151 can break the chiral symmetry and make the superconductor topologically trivial . however , the @xmath137 phase of the superconducting qahi is in the d - class [ ] and the zero energy majorana modes on the edge are robust against perturbations as long as the bulk gap is not closed .",
    "therefore , one can always extract an effective one dimensional hamiltonian from the two dimensional superconducting qahi which supports two majorana modes at each edge .",
    "the coupling of this one dimensional hamiltonian with normal leads can be described by eq.4 .",
    "therefore , the suppression of local andreev reflections and the appearance of almost resonant crossed andreev reflections in the qahi case are robust against perturbations .",
    "for the calculations of the momentum resolved transport properties of the qahi with superconducting pairing terms , we apply periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath80-direction and open boundary conditions in the @xmath135-direction .",
    "spinful normal leads are attached to the two edges parallel to the @xmath80-directions .",
    "the tight - binding model for a strip of qahi with superconducting pairing terms can be written as :    @xmath152+h.c\\notag\\\\ & & + \\sum_i [ ( { \\gamma_z}'-2t'_s\\cos k_x ) ( c^\\dagger_{i , k_x,\\uparrow}c_{i , k_x,\\uparrow}-c^\\dagger_{i , k_x,\\downarrow}c_{i , k_x,\\downarrow } + 2t'_{\\rm so}\\sin k_x ( c^\\dagger_{i , k_x,\\uparrow}c_{i , k_x,\\downarrow}+c^\\dagger_{i , k_x,\\downarrow}c_{i , k_x,\\uparrow } ) \\notag\\\\ & & + \\delta ( c^\\dagger_{i , k_x,\\uparrow}c^\\dagger_{i ,- k_x,\\downarrow}+h.c . ) ] .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath153 ( @xmath154 ) denotes an electron operator at site @xmath74 along the @xmath135-direction and has momentum quantum number @xmath155 along the @xmath80-direction and spin up ( spin down ) with respect to the @xmath156-direction . in all the figures in fig.4 ,",
    "the parameters are : @xmath157 , @xmath158 . for fig.4c and fig.4e , @xmath159 and @xmath160 so that the system is in the @xmath161 phase . in fig.4d and fig.4f , @xmath162 and @xmath160 so that the system is in the @xmath163 phase .",
    "the same tight - binding model @xmath164 , with @xmath127 , can be used to describe the bdi class topological superconductor @xmath37 of eq.2 with parameters @xmath165 , @xmath166 and @xmath167 . in fig.2 and fig.3 , @xmath168 and the number of sites in the @xmath135-direction is @xmath169 and @xmath99 respectively where @xmath100 is the lattice constant .",
