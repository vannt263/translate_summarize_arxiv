    "the flexibility of this crystal structure means that we are also at liberty to include magnetic 4@xmath8/5@xmath8 transition metal @xmath9-site ions and thereby study spin dimers distributed on a triangular lattice with significant spin - orbit coupling and orbital hybridization . in the case of the ruthenates ba@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 , where @xmath10 is non - magnetic ,",
    "one obtains a triangular lattice of magnetic , mixed - valence ru dimers .",
    "a total of seven electrons occupy each dimer and this leads to the possibility of charge , orbital and spin degrees of freedom .    for analogous 3@xmath8 transition metal - based dimer systems with more than two electrons per dimer , hund s coupling is usually dominant and therefore needs to be treated before turning to intersite effects such as electron hopping and the interdimer coulomb interaction .",
    "however , recent theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite work has shown that this approach can break down in some 4@xmath8 and 5@xmath8 transition metal - based dimer systems , where hund s coupling is expected to be significantly weaker due to the spatially - extended @xmath8-orbitals .",
    "this more complicated regime may be realized in the ba@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 family , as any simple picture based on dominant hund s coupling can not describe all of the known magnetic properties of the ru dimers .",
    "ll   &   +   + ( a ) & ( b ) +   +    more specifically , two different magnetic ground states for the ru dimers in ba@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 have been proposed previously that are consistent with dominant hund s coupling .",

    "@xcite first assumed that all seven electrons were localized at particular ru sites , which leads to ru@xmath11 charge order within the dimers and antiferromagnetic intradimer exchange .",
    "they argued that the latter should produce dimers with a magnetic ground state of total spin @xmath12  @xmath4  1/2 , which could explain the loss of effective magnetic moment with decreasing temperature in their @xmath3  @xmath4  in , y and lu magnetic susceptibility measurements and an entropy release of @xmath13 in their specific heat data at the low temperature magnetic phase transitions ( @xmath14  @xmath4  4.5 , 4.5 , and 9.5  k for in , y , and lu ) .",
    "however , their model fails to explain the very different , monotonic susceptibility in the @xmath15 la sample , as the intradimer exchange interaction would have to change dramatically , from strongly antiferromagnetic to strongly ferromagnetic with only a tiny modification of the crystal structure .",
    "even if that were possible , the model would imply @xmath16 dimers in the la compound which would lead to much larger values of susceptibility than are measured .",
    "furthermore , subsequent neutron diffraction measurements of the y system found no evidence for the required charge ordering within the dimers down to 2 k @xcite . for these reasons , the magnetic ground state of the ru dimers",
    "has also been discussed more recently in the context of molecular double exchange @xcite , but this simple model can not explain the non - monotonic @xmath17-dependence of the magnetic susceptibility , the low-@xmath17 entropy release in the specific heat data , and the small ordered moment sizes for the y and la systems found in neutron diffraction .",
    "this means that there is currently no comprehensive understanding of the magnetic ground states for single ru dimers in the ba@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 family .",

    "it is also possible that one crystallographic muon stopping site could give rise to two distinct frequencies as a result of a complex magnetic structure .",
    "however , the magnetic structure reported by senn _",

    "sr scans for the y and in samples.[lf],width=316 ]    the two - component exponential relaxation observed in the y and in samples can be interpreted in two ways .",
    "first , in a quasi - static picture , the slow relaxation arises from a so - called 1/3 tail with a weak @xmath86 relaxation rate coming from residual spin fluctuations , and the fast relaxation is the 2/3 component coming from random internal fields .",
    "alternatively , one could suspect a dynamic , but inhomogeneous , material with two different @xmath91 times .",
    "longitudinal field scans at the lowest temperature , shown in fig .",
    "[ lf ] , confirm that the fast relaxation is a result of static inhomogeneities as it is decoupled fairly quickly .",
    "more precisely , in the y sample , the fast relaxation is @xmath105 @xmath5s@xmath55 , implying an internal field distribution of width @xmath106 g. thus , the application of a longitudinal field equal to @xmath107 , should entirely decouple the muon spins from the internal field and eliminate the fast - relaxing 2/3 component of @xmath34  @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ lf](a ) , this appears to be the case for the lf  @xmath4  2000 g spectrum .",
    "furthermore , as seen in fig .",
    "[ lf](b ) , the zf fast relaxation for the in sample ( @xmath108 @xmath5s@xmath55 ) is somewhat more easily decoupled via application of a longitudinal field , as expected .",
    "it is thus clear that these materials host static magnetic ground states from the perspective of @xmath5sr .",
    "it is tempting to attribute the lack of oscillations in the zf muon spin polarization of the in and y samples to spin glass physics , especially since a zero - field - cooled / field - cooled divergence has been previously observed at @xmath14 in the dc susceptibility of the former system @xcite .",
    "furthermore , many geometrically - frustrated magnetic materials show a strong sensitivity to tiny amounts of quenched crystalline disorder which can lead to a spin glass transition  @xcite .",
    "however , we have also measured the ac susceptibility of these materials at several different frequencies ( ranging from 333 hz to 9999 hz ) and found no evidence of spin glassiness . more specifically , as shown in fig .",
    "[ acchi ] , the position , @xmath109 , of the real part of the ac susceptibility , @xmath110 , is independent of frequency , in the frequency range studied . a conventional spin glass will show a maximum in @xmath111 at the freezing temperature , @xmath112 , which then depends strongly on the frequency of measurement , with an extrapolation to zero - frequency allowing for a determination of the true glass temperature , @xmath113  @xcite . whereas the in and y samples have a single peak in @xmath111 , the lu sample has a somewhat more complicated susceptibility , with a relatively sharp peak at @xmath114 k , corresponding to the peak in specific heat and the onset of oscillations in @xmath5sr and a lower - temperature peak , similar to that of the y sample , which likely corresponds to the gradual onset of fast relaxation ( @xmath90 ) in the @xmath5sr spectra . in other words , the broad , lower temperature peak , is associated with the disordered portion of the sample .",
    "nonetheless , this peak does not seem to show an appreciable dependence on frequency , but simply a very slight increase in magnitude at 9999 hz .",
    "these two features end up forming a rather broad critical temperature regime which is consistent with the broad @xmath86 feature observed in our @xmath5sr experiments on the lu sample . given our ac susceptibility results and the fact that magnetic bragg peaks were observed in neutron diffraction measurements on a different y sample @xcite , it appears that these materials are not conventional spin glasses and likely have long - range ordered ground states .",
    "there are several possible origins for strongly - damped oscillations in the @xmath5sr data .",
    "we will concentrate on static origins only , since the well - defined 1/3 tail in our data indicates that the spins are mostly static , or fluctuating so slowly that they are essentially static from the point of view of @xmath5sr .",
    "the two possible static origins of the strong damping are ( 1 ) a large number of inequivalent muon stopping sites and ( 2 ) a modulation of the internal fields by disorder .",
    "the first scenario is highly unlikely given the two well - defined oscillations in the lu data , which imply that there are two preferred crystallographic sites for the muons .",
    "on the other hand , the second scenario appears to be compatible with our @xmath5sr and neutron scattering results .",
    "an antiferromagnetic , symmetry - breaking long - range order can coexist with a large random modulation of the moments .",
    "this large amount of disorder can lead to the loss of oscillations in the zf muon spin polarization and a reduced magnetic signal in neutron scattering that is not observed in our measurements .",
    "given the discrepancy between our results and earlier neutron diffraction work on the y system  @xcite , it is logical to suspect the influence of sample - dependent disorder on the magnetic ground state .",
    "it is also valuable to consider the implications of the observed @xmath5sr signals for the molecular magnet model proposed above , notably through the size of the measured internal fields .",
    "dipolar coupling to point - like dipoles of @xmath115 per site ( @xmath43 per dimer ) should give rise to an oscillation frequency of @xmath116 mhz for a @xmath83 stopping @xmath117 away from the o@xmath73 site .",
    "hence , the fact that we observe @xmath118 mhz in the lu sample implies a magnetic moment of only @xmath119 ( @xmath120 per dimer ) .",
    "evidently a model of point - like dipoles on the ru sites is highly simplistic .",
    "even so , our results indicate that the spins are probably very much extended over an entire ru@xmath1o@xmath2 `` molecule '' which is consistent with the orbital hybridization picture discussed above .",
    "indeed , the slow oscillations seen here resemble those observed in molecular magnets where each spin is distributed over an entire molecular unit  @xcite .",
    "the ordered magnetic moments for the y and in samples appear to be similarly weak , which is likely why no magnetic signal was detected in our elastic neutron diffraction measurements .    ) of all three samples at two different frequencies , 333 hz and 9999 hz .",
    "the high frequency data has been normalized so that the peak susceptibilities are equal , since the frequency response of the _ ppms _ system is not perfectly flat . otherwise , the temperature dependence of the susceptibilities are very similar . in particular , the peak positions are independent of frequency .",
    "[ acchi],width=316 ]    finally , we can speculate as to why the y and in samples show such a high level of disordered static magnetism . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ orbitals](a ) and ( b ) , the @xmath71 and @xmath72 orbitals remain degenerate in the ba@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 structure . for the lu , y and in samples , only one electron occupies the anti - bonding @xmath72 orbitals and therefore they are jahn - teller ( jt ) active .",
    "importantly , this degeneracy is not lifted by the spin - orbit coupling  @xcite .",
    "this may leave these materials vulnerable to local structural distortions that relieve the degeneracy , but lead to disorder in the interdimer exchange or the crystalline electric field , both of which can modulate the size of the ordered moments . an important parallel can be found in the sister compound ba@xmath7cusb@xmath1o@xmath2 , which is also based on @xmath43 moments and jahn - teller active  @xcite . in ba@xmath7cusb@xmath1o@xmath2 , two distinct behaviors are observed , depending on the precise stoichiometry of the samples  @xcite . in some off - stoichiometric samples ,",
    "the orbital degeneracy is relieved by an orthorhombic distortion ( a collective jt transition ) near 200 k. ultimately , these orthorhombic samples order magnetically at low temperatures .",
    "more stoichiometric samples manage to preserve their room - temperature hexagonal symmetry down to much lower temperatures either through a dynamic jt effect  @xcite or else local distortions that nonetheless preserve the global symmetry of the structure and give rise to a random - singlet magnetic ground state  @xcite .",
    "the most recent experimental results , thermal conductivity measurements , on nearly stoichiometric single - crystal ba@xmath7cusb@xmath1o@xmath2 point toward the local - distortion picture  @xcite which is consistent with the random singlet magnetic ground state and excitation gap  @xcite . since a hexagonal to orthorhombic collective jt transition can be ruled out by the neutron diffraction results on the materials studied here , similar random distortions might then apply , and they may be extremely important for understanding the collective magnetic ground states and possible sample dependence of the magnetic properties .",
    "future work should search for these local distortions , possibly via x - ray absorption fine structure measurements .",
    "we have used a wide array of experimental techniques to characterize both the single dimer and collective magnetic properties of the mixed valence ru dimer systems ba@xmath0ru@xmath1o@xmath2 ( @xmath3  @xmath4  in , y and lu ) .",
    "our combined neutron powder diffraction , dc magnetic susceptibility , and inelastic neutron scattering results indicate that the ru dimers are best described as molecular units with one spin-1/2 moment distributed equally over the two ru sites .",
    "two dispersive magnetic excitations are observed in the inelastic neutron scattering spectrum of each system .",
    "we attribute the lower energy mode to electron transitions between antibonding orbitals , while the upper mode is argued to arise from electron transitions between bonding and antibonding orbitals .",
    "the dimers form a quasi-2d triangular lattice , which is strongly frustrated due to significant antiferromagnetic interdimer exchange .",
    "our heat capacity and muon spin relaxation results reveal that the molecular moments develop a static magnetic ground state in each case , with clear evidence of long - range magnetic order for the lu sample .",
    "the size of the static internal fields observed in @xmath5sr at low temperatures are consistent with @xmath43 moments distributed over an entire ru@xmath1o@xmath2 dimer , similar to molecular magnets .",
    "although the static magnetism is much more disordered for the y and in samples , they do not appear to be conventional spin glasses , for example .",
    "overall , the current work demonstrates that the 6h - perovskites ba@xmath6o@xmath2 are excellent model systems for detailed investigations of frustrated quantum magnetism arising from spin-1/2 molecular building blocks on a triangular lattice .",
    "given the strong theoretical interest in @xmath43 triangular - lattice antiferromagnets and the rarity of representative materials , these systems should be attractive for future studies of the magnetic ground state and magnetization process , albeit with the added complexity of orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "finally , we note that our results can likely be directly applied to understanding the magnetic properties of the related ir - dimer system , ba@xmath7inir@xmath1o@xmath2 , which also seem to be consistent with spin-1/2 dimers at low temperature , and moreover appear to indicate a gapless quantum spin liquid ground state  @xcite .",
