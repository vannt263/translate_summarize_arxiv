    "pagerank , a measure of webpages relevance introduced by brin and page , is at the heart of the well known search engine google  @xcite .",
    "google classifies the webpages according to the pertinence scores given by pagerank , which are computed from the graph structure of the web .",
    "a page with a high pagerank will appear among the first items in the list of pages corresponding to a particular query .    if we look at the popularity of google , it is not surprising that some webmasters want to increase the pagerank of their webpages in order to get more visits from websurfers to their website .",
    "since pagerank is based on the link structure of the web , it is therefore useful to understand how addition or deletion of hyperlinks influence it .    mathematical analysis of pagerank s sensitivity with respect to perturbations of the matrix describing the webgraph is a topical subject of interest ( see for instance  @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "normwise and componentwise conditioning bounds  @xcite as well as the derivative  @xcite are used to understand the sensitivity of the pagerank vector .",
    "it appears that the pagerank vector is relatively insensitive to small changes in the graph structure , at least when these changes concern webpages with a low pagerank score  @xcite .",
    "one could think therefore that trying to modify its pagerank via changes in the link structure of the web is a waste of time .",
    "however , what is important for webmasters is not the values of the pagerank vector but the _ ranking _ that ensues from it .",
    "lempel and morel  @xcite showed that pagerank is not rank - stable , i.e.  small modifications in the link structure of the webgraph may cause dramatic changes in the ranking of the webpages .",
    "therefore , the question of how the pagerank of a particular page or set of pages could be increased  even slightly  by adding or removing links to the webgraph remains of interest .",
    "as it is well known  @xcite , if a hyperlink from a page @xmath1 to a page @xmath2 is added , without no other modification in the web , then the pagerank of @xmath2 will increase .",
    "but in general , you do not have control on the _ inlinks _ of your webpage unless you pay another webmaster to add a hyperlink from his / her page to your or you make an _ alliance _ with him / her by trading a link for a link  @xcite .",
    "but it is natural to ask how you could modify your pagerank by yourself .",
    "this leads to analyze how the choice of the _ outlinks _ of a page can influence its own pagerank .",
    "sydow  @xcite showed via numerical simulations that adding well chosen outlinks to a webpage may increase significantly its pagerank ranking .",
    "avrachenkov and litvak  @xcite analyzed theoretically the possible effect of new outlinks on the pagerank of a page and its neighbors .",
    "supposing that a webpage has control only on its outlinks , they gave the optimal linkage strategy for this single page .",
    "bianchini et al .",
    "@xcite as well as avrachenkov and litvak in  @xcite consider the impact of links between web communities ( websites or sets of related webpages ) , respectively on the sum of the pageranks and on the individual pagerank scores of the pages of some community .",
    "they give general rules in order to have a pagerank as high as possible but they do not provide an optimal link structure for a website .    our aim in this paper is to find a generalization of avrachenkov ",
    "litvak s optimal linkage strategy  @xcite to the case of _ a website with several pages_. we consider a given set of pages and suppose we have only control on the _ outlinks _ of these pages .",
    "we are interested in the problem of _ maximizing the sum of the pageranks _ of these pages .",
    "suppose @xmath3 be the webgraph , with a set of nodes @xmath4 and a set of links @xmath5 .",
    "for a subset of nodes @xmath6 , we define @xmath7    if we do not impose any condition on @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the problem of maximizing the sum of the pageranks of pages of @xmath0 is quite trivial and does not have much interest ( see the discussion in section  [ sec : optimal - linkage - strategy ] ) . therefore , when characterizing optimal link structures , we will make the following _ accessibility assumption _ : every page of the website must have an access to the rest of the web .",
    "our first main result concerns the _ optimal outlink structure _ for a given website . in the case where the subgraph corresponding to the website is strongly connected",
    ", theorem  [ thm : out - opt ] can be particularized as follows .",
    "let @xmath8 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 be given .",
    "suppose that the subgraph @xmath12 is strongly connected and @xmath13 .",
    "then every optimal outlink structure @xmath9 is to have only one outlink to a particular page outside of @xmath0 .",
    "we are also interested in the optimal _ internal _ link structure for a website . in the case where there is a unique leaking node in the website , that is only one node linking to the rest of the web , theorem  [ thm : intr - opt ]",
    "can be particularized as follows .",
    "let @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 be given .",
    "suppose that there is only one leaking node in @xmath0",
    ". then every optimal internal link structure @xmath8 is composed of together with every possible backward link .",
    "putting together theorems  [ thm : out - opt ] and  [ thm : intr - opt ] , we get in theorem  [ thm : website - opt ] the _ optimal link structure _ for a website .",
    "this optimal structure is illustrated in figure  [ fig : optimal - link - structure ] .",
    "let @xmath10 and @xmath11 be given .",
    "then , for every optimal link structure , @xmath8 is composed of a forward chain of links together with every possible backward link , and @xmath9 consists of a unique outlink , starting from the last node of the chain",
    ".     of five pages must have this structure . ]",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the following preliminary section",
    ", we recall some graph concepts as well as the definition of the pagerank , and we introduce some notations . in section  [ sec : pr - set ] , we develop tools for analysing the pagerank of a set of pages  @xmath0 .",
    "then we come to the main part of this paper : in section  [ sec : optimal - linkage - strategy ] we provide the optimal linkage strategy for a set of nodes . in section  [ sec : extensions - variants ] , we give some extensions and variants of the main theorems .",
    "we end this paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "let @xmath14 be a directed graph representing the web .",
    "the webpages are represented by the set of nodes @xmath4 and the hyperlinks are represented by the set of directed links @xmath5 .",
    "that means that @xmath15 if and only if there exists a hyperlink linking page  @xmath1 to page  @xmath2 .",
    "let us first briefly recall some usual concepts about directed graphs ( see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "a link @xmath16 is said to be an _ outlink _ for node @xmath1 and an _ inlink _ for node @xmath2 .",

    "@xmath26 if @xmath1 has an access to at least one node @xmath27 . the graph @xmath28 is _ strongly connected _ if every node of @xmath29 has an access to every other node of @xmath29 .",

    "let us now briefly introduce the pagerank score ( see  @xcite for background ) . without loss of generality ( please refer to the book of langville and meyer  @xcite or the survey of bianchini et al .",
    "@xcite for details ) , we can make the assumption that _ each node has at least one outlink _",
    ", i.e.  @xmath35 .",
    "therefore the @xmath36 stochastic matrix @xmath37_{i , j\\in{\\mathcal{n}}}$ ] given by @xmath38 is well defined and is a scaling of the adjacency matrix of @xmath39 .",
    "let also @xmath40 be a _ damping factor _ and @xmath41 be a positive stochastic _ personalization vector _ , i.e.  @xmath42 for all @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 denotes the vector of all ones .",
    "the _ google matrix _ is then defined as @xmath46 since @xmath47 and @xmath48 , this stochastic matrix is positive , i.e.  @xmath49 for all @xmath50 .",

    "@xmath1 is the @xmath54 entry @xmath55 of the pagerank vector .",
    "the pagerank vector is usually interpreted as the stationary distribution of the following markov chain ( see for instance  @xcite ) : a random surfer moves on the webgraph , using hyperlinks between pages with a probability @xmath56 and _ zapping _ to some new page according to the personalization vector with a probability @xmath57 .",
    "the google matrix @xmath52 is the probability transition matrix of this random walk . in this stochastic interpretation",
    ", the pagerank of a node is equal to the inverse of its mean return time , that is @xmath58 is the mean number of steps a random surfer starting in node  @xmath1 will take for coming back to  @xmath1 ( see  @xcite ) .",

    "the pagerank of @xmath0 can be expressed as @xmath63 from pagerank equations  .",

    "we will then show how it can be used in order to analyze the influence of some page @xmath67 on the pagerank of the set @xmath0 .",
    "we will end this section by briefly introducing the concept of basic absorbing graph , which will be useful in order to analyze optimal linkage strategies under some assumptions .",
    "let us first see how the entries of the vector @xmath68 can be interpreted .",
    "let us consider a random surfer on the webgraph @xmath28 that , as described in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] , follows the hyperlinks of the webgraph with a probability @xmath56 .",
    "but , instead of zapping to some page of @xmath28 with a probability @xmath57 , he _ stops _ his walk with probability @xmath57 at each step of time .",
    "this is equivalent to consider a random walk on the extended graph @xmath69 with a transition probability matrix @xmath70 at each step of time , with probability @xmath71 , the random surfer can _ disappear _ from the original graph , that is he can reach the absorbing node @xmath72 .",
