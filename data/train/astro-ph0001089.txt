    "the primordial density fluctuations are gaussian distributed , and the shape of their power spectrum is determined by a small number of physical parameters that describe the inflationary fluctuations themselves and the material contents of the universe . for specified cosmological parameters , the measurement of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies by the cobe - dmr experiment ( @xcite ; @xcite ) fixes the amplitude of the matter power spectrum on large scales with an uncertainty of @xmath12 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in this paper , we combine the cobe normalization with a recent measurement of the matter power spectrum by croft et al .",

    "the method , introduced by croft et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , is based on the physical picture of the ly@xmath1  forest that has emerged in recent years from 3-dimensional , hydrodynamic cosmological simulations and related analytic models ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . by focusing on the absorption from diffuse intergalactic gas in mildly non - linear structures , this method sidesteps the complicated theoretical problem of biased galaxy formation ; it directly estimates the linear theory mass power spectrum ( over a limited range of scales ) under the assumption of gaussian initial conditions . because the observational units are km s@xmath14 , the cwphk measurement probes somewhat different comoving scales for different cosmological parameters : @xmath15 for @xmath4=1 , @xmath16 for @xmath4=0.55 and @xmath17=0 , and @xmath18 for @xmath4=0.4 and @xmath17=0.6 ( @xmath19 ) .",

    "the extensive tests on simulations in croft et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and cwphk suggest that the statistical uncertainties quoted here dominate over systematic errors in the method itself , though the measurement does depend on the assumption of gaussian primordial fluctuations and on the broad physical picture of the ly@xmath1  forest described in the references above . for brevity , we will usually refer to the cwphk determination of the mass power spectrum as `` the ly@xmath1  @xmath5 . ''    in the next section , we discuss our choice of the parameter space for inflationary cdm models .",
    "the core of the paper is section 3 , where we combine the cobe normalization with the ly@xmath1  @xmath5 to identify acceptable regions of the cdm parameter space .",
    "we focus on four representative models : a low density ( @xmath22 ) open model , a low density flat model with a cosmological constant , and einstein - de sitter ( @xmath3 ) models with pure cdm and with a mixture of cdm and hot dark matter . because different parameters have nearly degenerate influences on the predicted ly@xmath1  @xmath5 , we are able to summarize our results in terms of simple equations that constrain combinations of these parameters . in section 4",
    ", we consider other observational constraints that can break these degeneracies , such as the cluster mass function , the peculiar velocity power spectrum , the shape of the galaxy power spectrum , and the cmb anisotropy power spectrum .",
    "we review our conclusions in section 5 .",
    "in simple inflationary models , the power spectrum of density fluctuations in the linear regime can be well approximated as a power law , @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 is the scale - invariant spectrum ) , multiplied by the square of a transfer function @xmath25 that depends on the relative energy densities of components with different equations of state .",
    "we will assume the standard radiation background ( microwave background photons and three species of light neutrinos ) and consider as other possible components cold dark matter , baryons , a `` cosmological constant '' vacuum energy , and neutrinos with a non - zero rest mass in the few ev range .",
    "within this class of models , the shape of the power spectrum is therefore determined by the parameters @xmath2 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 ( since @xmath31 ) . in place of @xmath27 and @xmath26",
    ", we use the parameters @xmath32 which is constrained by light - element abundances through big bang nucleosynthesis ( @xcite ) , and @xmath33 which fixes @xmath26 once @xmath34 , @xmath30 , and @xmath29 are specified . for non - zero @xmath35 , we assume one dominant family of massive neutrinos . we do not consider arbitrary combinations of @xmath11 and @xmath28 but instead restrict our attention to the two theoretically simplest possibilities , spatially flat models with @xmath36 and open models with @xmath37 .",
    "once the cosmological parameters are specified , normalizing to the results of the cobe - dmr experiment determines the amplitude of @xmath5 . for inflation models with @xmath38 , the cobe normalization",
    "can also be affected by the presence of tensor fluctuations ( gravity waves ) .",
    "we consider normalizations with no tensor contribution and normalizations with the quadrupole tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath39 predicted by simple power law inflation models ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but we do not consider arbitrary tensor contributions .",
    "we compute the cobe - normalized , linear theory , matter power spectrum @xmath5 using the convenient and accurate fitting formulas of eisenstein & hu ( 1999 ) , with the normalization procedures of bunn & white ( 1997 ) for all flat cases and for the open case without a tensor contribution and hu & white ( 1997 ) for the open case with a tensor contribution .",
    "there are plausible variants of this family of inflationary cdm models that we do not analyze in this paper , because we lack the tools to easily calculate their predictions and because they would make our parameter space intractably larger .",
    "prominent among these variants are models with a time - varying scalar field , a.k.a .",
    "`` quintessence '' ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , models in which the energy of the radiation background has been boosted above its standard value by a decaying particle species , a.k.a .",
    "`` @xmath40cdm '' ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and models in which inflation produces a power spectrum with broken scale invariance ( e.g. , @xcite ) . given the observational evidence for a negative pressure component from type ia supernovae ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , the quintessence family might be especially interesting to explore in future work .    in sum ,",
    "the free parameters of our family of cosmological models are @xmath11 , @xmath30 , @xmath2 , @xmath34 , @xmath29 , @xmath28 , and @xmath41 .",
    "we allow @xmath11 , @xmath30 , @xmath2 , @xmath34 , and @xmath29 to assume a continuous range of values . for @xmath28 and @xmath41",
    "we consider only two discrete options : @xmath37 or @xmath42 , and @xmath43 or @xmath44 .",
    "to organize our discussion and guide our analysis , we focus on variations about four fiducial models , each motivated by a combination of theoretical and observational considerations . the fiducial models are a flat cold dark matter model with a non - zero cosmological constant ( @xmath45cdm ) , an open cold dark matter model with no cosmological constant ( ocdm ) , an @xmath46 cold dark matter model with a significantly `` tilted '' inflationary spectrum ( tcdm ) , and an @xmath46 model with a mixture of cold and hot dark matter ( chdm ) .    for all of the fiducial models we adopt @xmath47 , based on recent measurements of the deuterium abundance in high - redshift lyman limit absorbers ( @xcite , 1998 ) . for the tcdm and chdm models we adopt @xmath48 in order to obtain a reasonable age for the universe",
    "given the assumption that @xmath3 .",
    "for the @xmath45cdm and ocdm models we instead adopt @xmath49 , which is better in line with recent direct estimates of the hubble constant ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for the @xmath45cdm model we take @xmath50 , but for ocdm we adopt a rather high density , @xmath51 , in anticipation of our results in section 4 , where we consider the cluster mass function as an additional observational constraint . for the chdm model",
    ", we take @xmath52 and assume one dominant species of massive neutrino ; for all other models @xmath53 with @xmath34 , @xmath30 , @xmath11 , and @xmath29 fixed , we are left with one free parameter , the inflationary spectral index @xmath2 , which we choose in order to fit the amplitude of the ly@xmath1  @xmath5 while maintaining the cobe normalization .",
    "the required value of @xmath2 is different for models with no tensor contribution to cmb anisotropies than for models with tensor fluctuations ; we refer to the fiducial models with tensor fluctuations as @xmath45cdm2 , ocdm2 , and tcdm2 .",
    "because a value @xmath54 is required for chdm and the assumption that @xmath39 therefore can not be correct in this case , we do not consider a chdm model with tensor fluctuations .",
    "table [ tbl : andrew ] lists the parameters of the fiducial models . for later reference ,",
    "table  [ tbl : andrew ] also lists each model s value of @xmath55 , the rms linear theory mass fluctuation in spheres of radius @xmath56 at @xmath57 .",

    "the values of the @xmath1 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 indices reflect the sensitivity of the predicted power spectrum amplitude @xmath60 to the model parameters , quantifying the impressions from figure  [ fig : bertrand ] . again taking @xmath45cdm as an example ,",
    "we see that small variations in @xmath30 and @xmath2 have much greater effect than small variations in @xmath4 , and that the suppression of small scale power from increases in @xmath34 is always a modest effect . models with tensors are much more sensitive to @xmath2 than models without tensors because of the influence of gravity waves on the @xmath5 normalization , as discussed above .",
    "although the index values are derived in all cases by considering small variations about the corresponding fiducial model , the constraint formula  ( [ eqn : constraint1 ] ) remains accurate even for fairly large changes in the cosmological parameters .",
    "for example , plugging the tcdm values of @xmath4 , @xmath30 , @xmath2 , @xmath34 into equation  ( [ eqn : constraint1 ] ) with the @xmath45cdm values of @xmath1 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 yields @xmath61 , compared to the value @xmath62 listed for @xmath45cdm in table  [ tbl : barnard ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : calvin ] shows that the effects of parameter changes are less degenerate in the chdm model .",
    "this difference in behavior is not surprising , since neutrino free streaming changes @xmath5 by depressing it at small scales rather than simply shifting or tilting it .",
    "the slope @xmath63 is therefore much more sensitive to changes in @xmath35 than to changes in other parameters .",
    "conversely , the influence of @xmath30 on @xmath63 through shifting @xmath64 is nearly cancelled by the effect of @xmath30 on the implied neutrino mass and free streaming length .",
    "we still analyze this case as above , adding a factor of @xmath65 , to obtain @xmath66 with parameters also listed in table  [ tbl : andrew ] .",
    "however , this equation can not describe the results of figure  [ fig : calvin ] as accurately as equation  ( [ eqn : constraint1 ] ) describes the results of figure  [ fig : bertrand ] .",

    "however , assuming gravitational instability and a cdm power spectrum shape , they extrapolate from their result to derive values of @xmath63 and @xmath70 that can be directly compared to cwphk s measurement at @xmath0 , @xmath71 , obtaining @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",

    "conveniently , the mcdonald et al .",
    "( 2000 ) point lies almost exactly on our @xmath75 error contour , so to a good approximation one can obtain the parameter constraints  ( [ eqn : constraint1 ] ) and  ( [ eqn : constraint2 ] ) implied by the mcdonald et al .",

    "we have shown that the combination of cobe and the ly@xmath1  @xmath5 yields constraints on degenerate combinations of cosmological parameters . to break these degeneracies , we now consider observational constraints from other studies of large scale structure and cmb anisotropies .",
    "analyses of cosmological parameter constraints from multiple observations have been carried out by numerous groups ( recent examples include @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",

    "we focus our attention on several other constraints that can be cast into a form that complements our results from section 3 : the mass function of galaxy clusters , the mass power spectrum inferred from galaxy peculiar velocities , the shape parameter of the galaxy power spectrum , and a constraint on @xmath2 from cmb anisotropy data .",
    "our discussion in this section will be more qualitative than our discussion in section 3 , in part because the uncertainties in these constraints are largely systematic , so that a straightforward statistical combination could be misleading .    in each panel of figures  [ fig : delmer ] and  [ fig : elbret ] , the heavy solid line shows the locus of @xmath78 values that yield a simultaneous match to cobe and the cwphk measurement of the ly@xmath1  @xmath5 .",
    "these lines are very close to those implied by equation  ( [ eqn : constraint1 ] ) and table  [ tbl : barnard ] , but since those results are , strictly speaking , expansions about our fiducial model parameters , we compute the best - fit value of @xmath2 exactly for each @xmath4 rather than using equation  ( [ eqn : constraint1 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath79 constraints are shown as the lighter solid lines ; these are close to the curves implied by equation  ( [ eqn : constraint1 ] ) and table  [ tbl : barnard ] with @xmath76 replaced by @xmath80 . because the ly@xmath1  @xmath5 constraint is not very sensitive to @xmath34 ,",

    "the tcdm models can be considered as the limit of either the flat or open models at @xmath3 .",
    "note that the mcdonald et al .",

    "( 1998 ) and listed above . for brevity , we will refer to these curves as the velocity power spectrum constraint , though they represent the constraints on the density power spectrum implied by peculiar velocites .",
    "we do not want to use the amplitude of the galaxy power spectrum as one of our constraints because it can be strongly affected by biased galaxy formation .",

    "a detailed consideration of constraints from smaller scale cmb anisotropy measurements is beyond the scope of this paper , but we do want to draw on limits that smaller scale measurements place on the inflationary index @xmath2 . for the no - tensor models , we adopt the `` weak prior '' constraint @xmath102 of netterfield et al .",

    "the shape parameter implications are usually intermediate , but significantly closer to those of the cluster mass function .",

    "[ fig : elbret ] we see that models matching cobe , the ly@xmath1  @xmath5 , and the cluster mass function are always consistent with this limit  easily in the case of flat models , sometimes marginally in the case of open models .",
    "models that match the velocity power spectrum instead of the cluster mass function are usually incompatible with this limit , though sometimes only marginally so .    the location of the first acoustic peak in the cmb anisotropy spectrum is a strong diagnostic for space curvature ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; hu et al .",
    "1997 ) , and recent anisotropy measurements on degree scales favor a geometry that is close to flat ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "clearly our flat universe models are compatible with these results , as are the open universe models that match the ly@xmath1  @xmath5 and the velocity power spectrum ( all of which have @xmath4 close to one ) .",
    "the open models that match ly@xmath1  @xmath5 and the cluster mass function are generally ruled out by the most recent , high precision limits on space curvature .",
    "the type ia supernova measurements of the cosmic expansion history ( @xcite ; @xcite ) add a great deal of discriminatory power , since they constrain a parameter combination that is roughly @xmath121 instead of @xmath122 ; perlmutter et al .",
    "( 1999 ) quote @xmath123 .",
    "all of the open models miss this constraint by many @xmath118 , and the flat models matching the ly@xmath1  @xmath5 and the velocity power spectrum fail because the values of @xmath4 are too high .",
    "the combination of cobe , the ly@xmath1  @xmath5 , and the cluster mass function , on the other hand , is compatible with the supernova results for flat models with a cosmological constant , though it favors somewhat higher values of @xmath4 .",
    "we have not carried out a similar multi - constraint analysis for the chdm model because the formulas  ( [ eqn : gammaconst ] ) and  ( [ eqn : velpk ] ) for the shape parameter and velocity power spectrum constraints do not apply to it and the formula  ( [ eqn : sigma8 ] ) for the cluster mass function constraint may be less accurate for non - zero @xmath35 .",
    "however , our fiducial chdm model , with @xmath124 , has @xmath125 , with @xmath126 .",
    "for @xmath127 we obtain @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) , for @xmath130 we obtain @xmath131 ( @xmath132 ) , and for the tcdm model , which represents the limiting case of @xmath133 , we obtain @xmath134 ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "all of these models are likely to violate the cluster mass function constraint , which according to equation  ( [ eqn : sigma8 ] ) implies @xmath136 for @xmath3 .",
    "we conclude that cobe - normalized chdm models with @xmath3 , @xmath137 can not simultaneously match the ly@xmath1  @xmath5 and the cluster mass function . the ly@xmath1  @xmath5 strengthens the case against this class of chdm models by ruling out the low values of @xmath2 that would otherwise allow them to match cluster masses ( @xcite )",
    "of course chdm models with @xmath138 can satisfy the observational constraints for appropriate parameter choices , and the general problem of using cmb measurements and the ly@xmath1  @xmath5 to measure @xmath35 is discussed by croft , hu , & dav ( 1999 ) .",
    "however , the possible presence of a neutrino component does not alter our conclusion that cobe , the ly@xmath1  @xmath5 , and the cluster mass function together require a low density universe .",

    "moderate improvements in the statistical precision of the constraints considered here could strengthen this support , or they could open fissures of disagreement .",
    "improvements in the near future could also allow some interesting new tests , such as discriminating between models with no tensor fluctuations and models with the @xmath39 contribution predicted by power law inflation .",
    "a detailed consideration of the constraints from cmb anisotropy measurements is a major undertaking in itself , well beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , to illustrate the interplay between our results and recent cmb experiments , we plot in figure  [ fig : fagan ] the predicted cmb power spectra of five of our fiducial models : @xmath45cdm , @xmath45cdm2 , ocdm , tcdm , and chdm .",
    "we computed these power spectra using cmbfast ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , with the cosmological parameter values listed in table  [ tbl : andrew ] .",
    "the chdm model stands out from the rest because matching the ly@xmath1  @xmath5 requires a high value of @xmath2 , which boosts the anisotropy on small scales .",
    "the ocdm model also stands out , albeit less dramatically , because the open space geometry shifts the acoustic peaks to smaller angles .",
    "the tcdm model lies below the @xmath45cdm models because of its larger tilt , which suppresses small scale fluctuations .",
    "figure  [ fig : fagan ] shows data points taken from the joint analysis of numerous cmb data sets by wang et al .",
    "( 2001 ; see their table 1 ) .",
    "the two @xmath45cdm models fit these data points remarkably well , given that the choice of their parameters was not based on small scale cmb data at all . because the combination of cobe and the ly@xmath1  @xmath5 implies @xmath2 close to one for both of these models , their predictions are not very different , and the current cmb data do not distinguish between them .",
    "however , the tcdm , ocdm , and chdm models are clearly ruled out , and while we have not attempted to adjust their parameters within the constraints allowed by equations  ( [ eqn : constraint1 ] ) and  ( [ eqn : constraint2 ] ) , it appears unlikely that any such adjustment would allow these models to fit the current cmb data .",
    "the slope of the mass power spectrum inferred by cwphk from the ly@xmath1  forest , @xmath8 at @xmath141 at @xmath0 , confirms one of the basic predictions of the inflationary cdm scenario : an approximately scale - invariant spectrum of primeval inflationary fluctuations ( @xmath9 ) modulated by a transfer function that bends the power spectrum towards @xmath142 on small scales .",
    "if the measured slope of the power spectrum had implied @xmath143 or @xmath144 , we would have been unable to reproduce the ly@xmath1  @xmath5 with any of the models considered here , even allowing wide variations in the cosmological parameters .    because the amplitude of the cobe - normalized power spectrum on small scales is very sensitive to @xmath2 , we are able to match the cwphk measurement of @xmath60 in most of the major variants of the cdm scenario ( @xmath45cdm , ocdm , tcdm , chdm ) by treating @xmath2 as a free parameter . within each of these variants ,",
    "we obtain constraints on the model parameters of the form @xmath145 ( eq .  [ eqn : constraint1 ] ) or @xmath146 ( eq .  [ eqn : constraint2 ] ) , with the parameter values listed in table  [ tbl : barnard ] .",
    "these constraints , together with the confirmation of the predicted slope , are the main results to emerge from combining the ly@xmath1  @xmath5 measurement with the cobe - dmr result .    as shown in figures  [ fig : delmer ] and  [ fig : elbret ] , the parameter combination constrained by cobe and the ly@xmath1  @xmath5 is different from the combinations constrained by other measurements of large scale structure and cmb anisotropy , so joint consideration of these constraints can break some of the degeneracies among the fundamental parameters .",
    "if we combine the ly@xmath1  @xmath5 constraint with the constraint on @xmath4 and @xmath55 inferred from the cluster mass function ( white et al .",
    "1993a ; ecf ) , then we favor a low density universe , with @xmath147 in flat models and @xmath111 in open models .",
    "this combination is also consistent with cmb anisotropy constraints on @xmath2 .",
    "the open models are inconsistent with the angular location of the first acoustic peak in the cmb power spectrum ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and they are strongly inconsistent with type ia supernova results , which imply @xmath148 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the flat models are consistent with both constraints . on the whole , the cwphk measurement of the ly@xmath1  @xmath5 supports the consensus in favor of @xmath45cdm with @xmath139 , @xmath140 .",
    "the contribution of the ly@xmath1  @xmath5 to this consensus comes both from the slope , which confirms the generic inflationary cdm prediction , and from the amplitude , which has a different dependence on cosmological parameters than any of the other constraints considered here .",
    "there are bright prospects for improvements of this approach in the near future .",
    "mcdonald et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have inferred the mass power spectrum from an independent ly@xmath1  forest data set using a different analysis method , obtaining a nearly identical slope and an amplitude lower by @xmath74 .",

    ". constraints from this new measurement of @xmath5 , using the method developed here , are presented in  7 of croft et al .",
    "recent measurements of cmb anisotropy have greatly improved the level of precision on small angular scales , and results from the map satellite should provide another major advance in the near future .",
    "these measurements yield tighter cosmological parameter constraints on their own , but they become substantially more powerful when combined with data that constrain the shape and amplitude of the matter power spectrum .",
    "it is evident from figures  [ fig : delmer ] and  [ fig : elbret ] that simply reducing the error bars on @xmath2 and the ly@xmath1  @xmath5 by a factor of two would already produce interesting new restrictions on the allowable range of models .",
    "these restrictions can become very powerful if ongoing studies of cluster masses using galaxy dynamics , x - ray properties , the sunyaev - zeldovich effect , and gravitational lensing confirm the robustness of the cluster mass function constraint . in the slightly longer term",
    ", the 2df and sloan redshift surveys should produce measurements of the shape of the galaxy power spectrum that shrink the current statistical and systematic uncertainties , so that demanding consistency between the inferred value of @xmath97 and other constraints becomes a useful additional test . at the very least",
    ", these developments should lead to a powerful test of the inflationary cdm picture and high - precision determinations of its parameters .",
    "if we are lucky , improved measurements will reveal deficiencies of the simplest @xmath45cdm models that are hidden within the current uncertainties , and resolving these discrepancies will lead us to a better understanding of the cosmic energy contents and the origin of primordial fluctuations in the hot early universe .",
