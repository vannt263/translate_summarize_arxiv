    "in 1686 , in his celebrated _ principia mathematica _ , isaac newton propounded the problem of determining the profile of a body of revolution , moving along its axis with constant speed , through some resisting medium , which would minimize the total resistance ( see @xcite ) . problems of this kind find application in the building of high - speed and high - altitude flying vehicles , such as in the design of missiles or artificial satellites .",
    "newton has given the correct answer to his problem , in the situation of a `` rare '' medium of perfectly elastic particles with constant mass and at equal distances from each other , the resisting pressure at a surface point of the body being proportional to the square of the normal component of its velocity , but without explaining how he obtained it .",
    "he did nt write , however , `` i have a great proof , but no space for it in the margins of this book '' . a proof `` from the book '' was waiting for the pontryagin maximum principle .    when one writes the resistance force @xmath0 associated to newton s problem , @xmath1 = \\int_0^t t \\ ,",
    "\\dfrac{1}{1+\\dot{x}(t)^2 } \\,\\mathrm{d}t \\ , , \\ ] ] one obtains an integral functional of the type of those studied throughout the history of the calculus of variations .",
    "however , due to the restrictions on the derivatives of admissible trajectories , @xmath2 , no satisfactory theory is available within the calculus of variations framework ( see @xcite ) . as first noticed by legendre in 1788 ( see @xcite and references therein ) , without such restrictions on the derivatives the problem has no solution ( the infimum is zero ) , since one can obtain arbitrarily small values for the integral resistance @xmath3 $ ] by choosing a zig - zag function @xmath4 wildly oscillating , with large derivatives in absolute value .",
    "to make the problem physically consistent one must take into account the monotonicity of the profile , and this means , as was first remarked by v.m .",
    "tikhomirov ( @xcite ) , that newton s problem belongs to optimal control : @xmath5 = \\int_0^t t \\ , \\frac{1}{1+u(t)^2 } \\ ,   \\mathrm{d}t \\longrightarrow \\min \\ , , \\notag \\\\",

    "h. j. sussmann and j. c. willems , in the beautiful paper @xcite , defended the polemic thesis that the brachystochrone date 1697 marks not only the birth of the calculus of variations but also the birth of optimal control .",
    "the truth seems to be deeper : optimal control was born in 1686 , before the calculus of variations , with newton s problem of minimal resistance .",
    "the restriction on the control @xmath6 , which appear in newton s problem , is a common ingredient of the optimal control problems .",
    "such constraints appears naturally in practical engineering control problems , and are treated with the pontryagin maximum principle  the central result of optimal control theory , first conjectured by l.  s.  pontryagin , and then proved , in the late 1950 s , by him and his collaborators , v.  g.  boltyanskii , r.  v.  gamkrelidze , and e.  f.  mishchenko @xcite . in an optimal control problem , the control functions take values on a set which is , in general , not a vector space .",
    "this is precisely what happens in newton s classical problem , and the reason why newton s problem must be classified as an optimal control problem , and not as a problem of the calculus of variations .",
    "newton s problem has been widely studied , and the literature about it is extensive .",
    "the main difficulty is that of existence @xcite : the lagrangian @xmath7 associated to newton s problem is neither coercive nor convex , and tonelli s direct method ( see @xcite ) fails . in order to prove existence ,",
    "several different classes of admissible functions have been proposed .",
    "the question is now usually treated with the help of relaxation techniques ( see @xcite ) , although direct arguments are also possible ( see @xcite ) . as we shall prove (  [ sec : mresult ] ) , for the newton - type problems , the existence of a minimizer follows easily from the pontryagin maximum principle : one can show that the pontryagin extremals are , for such problems , absolute minimizers ( theorem  [ res : peequivam ] ) .",
    "several extensions of newton s problem have been considered in recent years .",
    "this revival of interest in newton s problem , and in the study of many variations around it , has been motivated by the paper @xcite of g.  buttazzo and b.  kawohl .",
    "recent results on newton - type problems include : bodies without rotational symmetry ( nonsymmetric cases ) @xcite ; unbounded body ( resistance per unit area ) with one - impact assumption @xcite ; bodies with rotational symmetry and one - impact assumption , but not convex @xcite ; friction between particles and body ( non - elastic collisions ) @xcite ; bodies with prescribed volume @xcite ; multiple collisions allowed @xcite ; unbounded body and multiple collisions allowed @xcite .",
    "more recently , newton - type problems have been related with problems of mass transportation @xcite . for a good survey on mass optimization problems and open problems ,",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite .    here",
    "we consider convex @xmath8-dimensional bodies of revolution with height @xmath9 and radius of maximal cross section @xmath10 , and treat them using an optimal control approach .",
    "we will not be restricted to two - dimensional or three - dimensional bodies , considering bodies of arbitrary dimension @xmath11 .",
    "we also introduce a different point of view . for us the body does not move , and the particles are the ones who move .",
    "the body is situated in a flux of infinitesimal particles , the flux being invariant with respect to translations and rotations around the symmetry axis of the body .",
    "this new point of view is , in our opinion , physically more realistic .",
    "newton has considered the particles with no temperature ( not moving ) .",
    "when the particles have temperature , they move , and the flux of particles is not necessarily falling vertically downwards the body , as considered by newton .",
    "we will be considering new interesting situations with a non - parallel flux of particles .",
    "we obtain complete solution to this class of newton - type problems , by showing that , under some physically relevant assumptions on the lagrangian , a control is an absolute minimizing control for the problem if , and only if , it is a pontryagin extremal control .",
    "thus , for the newton - type problems we are dealing with , pontryagin maximum principle holds not only as a necessary optimality condition , but also as a sufficient condition .",
    "as very special situations , one obtains the solution found by newton himself (  [ sec : newprb ] ) , and solutions to newton s problem in higher - dimensions (  [ sec : newprbhd ] ) .",
    "the optimal control problem in lagrange form consists in the minimization of an integral functional @xmath12 = \\int_0^t l\\left(t , x(t),u(t)\\right ) \\mathrm{d}t\\ ] ] among all the solutions of a differential equation @xmath13 \\,\\ ] ] subject to the boundary conditions @xmath14 the lagrangian @xmath15 and the velocity function @xmath16 are defined on @xmath17 \\times \\mathbb{r}^n \\times \\omega$ ] , where @xmath18 is called the control set .",
    "the main difference between the problems of optimal control and those of the calculus of variations , is that @xmath19 is in general not an open set . in the case",

    "the second equation is known as the _ adjoint system_.    a quadruple @xmath41 satisfying the hamiltonian system and the maximality condition is called a pontryagin extremal .",

    "the extremals are said to be abnormal when @xmath42 and normal otherwise .",
    "if @xmath41 is a pontryagin extremal , then , for any @xmath43 , @xmath44 is also a pontryagin extremal . from this simple observation",
    "one can consider , without any loss of generality , that @xmath45 in the normal case .",
    "the fact that theorem  [ th : pmp ] asserts the existence of hamiltonian multipliers @xmath46 and @xmath33 not vanishing simultaneously is of primordial importance : without this condition , all admissible pairs @xmath30 would be pontryagin extremals .    in some situations , it may happen that functions @xmath15 and/or @xmath16 depend upon some parameters @xmath47 .",

    "the parameter problem can be reformulated in the format  by considering @xmath49 as a state variable with dynamics @xmath55 and initial condition @xmath56 .",
