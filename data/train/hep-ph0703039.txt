    "the rare decays @xmath0 and @xmath3 , driven by semi - leptonic flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) , are exceptionally clean probes of the flavor structure of the standard model , or of the still elusive new physics .",
    "concerted theoretical efforts have brought the sm predictions to an impressive level of accuracy ( for the current experimental situation , see @xcite ) . in this section ,",
    "the main theoretical ingredients are briefly reviewed , while the situation for each mode is summarized in the following sections .",
    "fcnc arise at one loop in the electroweak theory .",
    "the processes driving the rare semi - leptonic @xmath4 decays are the @xmath5 box , @xmath6 and @xmath7 penguins@xcite , see fig.1 , and lead to the amplitudes@xmath8with @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in standard terminology , the @xmath11 part is the indirect cp - violating piece ( icpv ) , while the @xmath12 part is called direct cp - violating ( dcpv ) .",
    "the amplitude for @xmath13 is obtained from the @xmath14 one by interchanging @xmath15 .    without the dependence of the loop functions @xmath16 on the quark masses ,",
    "ckm unitarity would imply vanishing fcnc ( gim mechanism ) .",
    "now , looking at these dependences , combined with the scaling of the ckm elements , one can readily get a handle on the importance of each quark contribution , and thereby on the cleanness achievable for the decay once qcd effects are included .        for @xmath17 ,",
    "only the @xmath6 penguin and @xmath5 box enter , @xmath18 , and light - quark contributions are suppressed . since , in addition , @xmath19 and @xmath20",
    ", icpv is very small . for @xmath21 ,",
    "the @xmath22-quark contribution is suppressed from the loop , but enhanced by @xmath23 , and ends up being comparable to the @xmath24-quark contribution .    for @xmath25 , the photon penguin also enters with its scaling @xmath26 for @xmath27 . in the standard ckm phase - convention , dcpv is still short - distance dominated thanks to @xmath28 , but not icpv , completely dominated by the long - distance @xmath29-quark photon penguin , @xmath30 .",
    "the same holds for @xmath31 , completely dominated by long - distance and therefore not very interesting for new physics search .    for @xmath32",
    ", there is no photon penguin , and the electroweak structure is similar to @xmath0 , up to the change @xmath33 .",
    "along with these contributions , there can be two - loop , third order electroweak contributions , if the extra suppression is compensated by non - perturbative long - distance enhancement .",
    "this occurs for modes with charged leptons , where the double - photon penguin gives a cp - conserving contribution ( @xmath34 ) to @xmath35 and @xmath32 , and is completely dominated by long - distance ( @xmath29-quark ) , fig.2c .",
    "having identified the relevant electroweak structures , qcd effects have now to be included .",
    "this is done in three main steps :        _ step 1 _ : integration of heavy degrees of freedom ( top , @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) , including perturbative qcd effects above @xmath36 .",
    "this generates local fcnc operators ( fig.1 with @xmath24-quark ) , and fermi - type four - fermion local operators .",
    "_ step 2 _ : resummation of qcd corrections ( running down ) . at the @xmath22 threshold ( similar for @xmath37 ) , four - fermion operators are combined to form closed @xmath22-loops , which are then replaced by a tower of effective interactions in increasing powers of ( external momentum)/(charm mass ) , fig.2a .",
    "the lowest order consists again of the dimension - six fcnc operators , while dimension - eight operators are corrections scaling naively like @xmath38 .    these first two steps ( the ope )",
    "can , in principle , be achieved to any desired level of precision within perturbative qcd , though the computation of the required multiloop diagrams represents a formidable task at higher orders .",
    "still , this is unavoidable in order to reduce theoretical errors , in particular scale dependences . at this stage ,",
    "one has obtained the complete hamiltonian , i.e. all the effective operators , with the short - distance physics encoded in their wilson coefficients .    _ step 3 _ : to get the amplitudes , the matrix elements of these operators between meson states remain to be estimated . to this end , one makes use of the symmetries of qcd , as embodied in chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) , to relate the desired matrix elements to experimentally known quantities .    for the most interesting dimension - six semi - leptonic operators",
    ", the matrix elements can be related to those of @xmath39 decays ( taking into account isospin - breaking corrections ) .",
    "contributions from four light - quark operators ( @xmath40 ) are represented directly in terms of meson fields in chpt , such that non - local @xmath29-quark loops are represented as meson loops ( fig.2b , c ) .",
    "the price to pay is the introduction of some unknown low - energy constants ( @xmath41 ) , to be extracted from experiment .",
    "in particular , @xmath42 is fixed from @xmath43 , accounting for the large non - perturbative @xmath44 effects . for dimension - eight operators ,",
    "an approximate matching is done with the chpt representation of the @xmath29-quark contributions .",
    "thanks to the suppression of light - quark effects , these modes are the cleanest and their rates are precisely predicted within the sm .",
    "their branching ratios read : @xmath47 with @xmath48 .",
    "the wilson coefficient of the dimension - six fcnc operator @xmath49 arising from the top - quark loop is known at nlo , @xmath50@xcite . for the charm - quark",
    ", the contribution to this operator has recently been obtained at nnlo@xcite , @xmath51 .",
    "residual @xmath22-quark effects from dimension - eight operators@xcite , along with long - distance @xmath29-quark effects@xcite amount to a small correction @xmath52@xcite .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath53 are known from @xmath54 , including the leading isospin - breaking corrections @xcite , and are encoded into @xmath55 and @xmath56 for @xmath57 . finally , for @xmath58",
    ", icpv is of about 1%@xcite while the cp - conserving contribution arising from box diagrams is less than 0.01%@xcite .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the sm predictions are then @xmath59 the error on @xmath58 is dominated by @xmath60 , while for @xmath61 , it breaks down to scales ( 13% ) , @xmath62(22% ) , ckm , @xmath63 , @xmath64 ( 37% ) and matrix - elements from @xmath54 and light - quark contributions ( 28%)@xcite .",
    "further improvements are thus possible through a better knowledge of @xmath62 , of the isospin - breaking in the @xmath65 form - factors , or by a lattice study of higher - dimensional operators@xcite .",
    "as the determination of @xmath66 from general ut fits to b physics data is already very precise , and expected to be further improved in the near future , the main interest of the @xmath0 decays is to test the ckm paradigm for cp - violation in the sm .",
    "indeed , these modes do offer a particularly interesting independent determination since , as discussed in @xcite , they are very sensitive to a large class of new physics models . as such , they also constitute one of the best windows into the flavor structure of the new physics that will hopefully be uncovered at lhc .",
    "here the situation is more involved .",
    "the @xmath24 and @xmath22-quark contributions generate both the dimension - six vector @xmath67 and axial - vector @xmath68 operators , whose wilson coefficients @xmath69 are known to nlo@xcite .",
    "the former produces the @xmath70 pair in a @xmath71 state , the latter in a @xmath72 state and , in addition , for @xmath73 , in a helicity - suppressed @xmath74 state .",
    "indirect cp - violation is related to @xmath75 , for which the long - distance photon penguin dominates ( fig.2b ) . in chpt , loops are small and one just needs to fix a counterterm , @xmath76@xcite .",
    "this can be done up to a sign from na48 measurements as @xmath77@xcite .",
    "producing @xmath70 in a @xmath71 state , it interferes with the contribution from @xmath78 , arguably constructively@xcite .",
    "the cp - conserving ( cpc ) contribution from @xmath79 proceeds through two - photons , i.e. produces the lepton pair in either a helicity - suppressed @xmath80 or phase - space suppressed @xmath81 state .",
    "only the @xmath80 state is produced at lo through the finite two - loop process @xmath82 , @xmath83 ( fig.2c ) .",
    "higher order corrections are estimated using @xmath84 experimental data for both the @xmath85@xcite and @xmath81 contributions@xcite .",
    "altogether , the branching ratios are @xmath86 with the coefficients given in table i. interestingly , these coefficients obey @xmath87 due to the phase - space suppression , but for the helicity - suppressed contributions arising from the @xmath88 operator ( dcpv ) and from @xmath89 ( cpc ) .",
    "this maintains the sensitivity of @xmath90 on the interesting short - distance physics at the same level as @xmath91 .",
    "further , it allows in principle to disentangle the @xmath78 and @xmath88 contributions from the measurements of both modes .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.3a , where the hyperbola corresponds to a common rescaling of both @xmath92 and @xmath93@xcite . as discussed in @xcite ,",
    "this plane is particularly interesting to look for signals of new physics , and identify its precise nature@xcite .    in the sm , @xmath94 and @xmath95@xcite , and",
    "the predicted rates are@xcite:@xmath96 for constructive ( destructive ) interference ( fig.3a ) .",
    "overall , the error on @xmath76 is currently the most limiting and better measurements of @xmath75 would be welcomed ( fig.3b ) .",
    "also , better measurements of @xmath84 would help reduce the error on the @xmath80 and @xmath81 contributions .",
    "alternatively , they can be partially cut away through energy cuts or dalitz plot analyses@xcite .    the integrated forward - backward ( or lepton - energy ) asymmetry @xcite @xmath97 is generated by the interference between cp - conserving and cp - violating amplitudes .",
    "it can not be reliably estimated at present for @xmath98 because of the poor theoretical control on the @xmath81 contribution .",
    "the situation is better for @xmath99 , for which this part is negligible,@xmath100 i.e. , @xmath101(@xmath102 ) for constructive ( destructive ) interference@xcite .",
    "interestingly , though the error is large , @xmath103 can be used to fix the sign of @xmath76 .",
    "for this mode , the short - distance ( sd ) piece from @xmath24 and @xmath22-quarks is known to nlo and nnlo@xcite , respectively .",
    "indirect cp - violation is negligible .",
    "the long - distance ( ld ) contribution from @xmath79 matrix elements proceeds again through two - photons .",
    "still , there are three differences with respect to the @xmath3 decays .",
    "first , the contribution from the imaginary part of the @xmath89 loop , estimated from @xmath104 , is much larger than sd , and already accounts for the bulk of the experimental @xmath105 rate .",
    "second , while the charged meson loop in @xmath35 acts like a cut - off , and a finite result is found , now the two photons arise from the axial anomaly , and @xmath106 is divergent , requiring unknown counterterms . to estimate them , though still with a large error",
    ", one can use the experimental information on @xmath107 together with the perturbative behavior of the @xmath108 loop@xcite .",
    "finally , sd and ld produce the same @xmath74 state and thus interfere .",
    "this interference , which depends on the sign of @xmath109 , is presumably constructive@xcite .",
    "better measurements of @xmath110 or @xmath111 could settle this sign .",
    "@xmath2 is thus obviously not as clean as @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",
    "nevertheless , being measured precisely , it can still lead to interesting constraints in some specific scenarios like susy at large @xmath112@xcite .",
    "thanks to the numerous theoretical efforts , the four rare decays , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , now provide for one of the cleanest and most sensitive tests of the standard model .",
    "these modes are promising not only to get clear signals of new physics  or to severely constrain it  , but also to uncover the nature of the possible new physics at play through the specific pattern of deviations they would exhibit with respect to the sm predictions .",
