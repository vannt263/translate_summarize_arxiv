    "fractional laplacian operators are usually considered as the prototype of the non - local operators @xcite and have recently garnered much attention in many applications in mathematics and physics .",
    "related problems usually lie at the interface of probability , stochastic processes , partial differential equations and spectral theory such as @xcite . for some applications ,",
    "we refer the reader to graphene models @xcite , obstacle problems @xcite , non - local minimal surfaces @xcite .    in this article",
    ", we study eigenvalues of the fractional laplacian operator @xmath6 defined by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a bounded connected domain with smooth boundary in @xmath9 , for either @xmath2 @xmath10 or @xmath11 and @xmath12 since @xmath8 is bounded , the spectrum of the fractional laplacian is discrete and eigenvalues @xmath13 ( including multiplicities ) can be sorted in an increasing order .",
    "unlike laplacian , fractional laplacian is a non - local operator such that for suitable test functions , including all functions in @xmath14 , it is defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a well - known positive normalizing constant . from a probabilistic point of view , @xmath6 can be considered as the infinitesimal generator of the semigroup of the symmetric @xmath17stable process , denoted by @xmath18 , with the characteristic function @xmath19 where @xmath20 is called the transition density of the stable process ( or the heat kernel of the fractional laplacian ) . while explicit formulae for the transition density of symmetric @xmath21-stable processes are only available for the cauchy process ( @xmath22 ) and the brownian motion ( @xmath23 ) , these processes share many of the basic properties of the brownian motion .",
    "another process of importance is the holtsmark distribution ( @xmath24 ) which is used to model gravitational fields of stars ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "stable processes do not have continuous paths which is related to non - locality of the fractional laplacian operator @xcite .",
    "when fractional laplacians involved , some of the known methods fail because of the fractional power and non - locality of such operators .",
    "this drawback can be evaded by using the fourier transform definition .",
    "recall that the fourier transform and its inverse are defined as @xmath25(\\mu ) = \\hat{u}(\\mu)=c_d\\int_{{\\mathbb r}^d}e^{-i\\mu\\cdot z}\\,u(z)\\,dz , \\quad{\\mathcal f}^{-1}[u](z)=c_d\\int_{{\\mathbb r}^d}e^{i\\mu\\cdot z}\\,u(\\mu)\\,d\\mu,\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the normalizing constant .",
    "interestingly , the fractional laplacian operator on @xmath1 can be defined as a pseudo - differential operator as @xmath27\\right],\\qquad 0<\\alpha \\le2 , \\quad u\\in h_0^{\\alpha/2}(\\omega).\\ ] ] here , @xmath28 denotes the sobolev space of order @xmath29 .",
    "when @xmath30 , one can look at proposition 3.3 .",
    "@xcite for the proof of the equivalence between the definitions in and .",
    "there is an extensive literature devoted to the inequalities involving the eigenvalues of the dirichlet laplacian operator , which can be regarded as the fractional laplacian when @xmath23 .",
    "one may consult the articles @xcite and references therein for a through literature review .",
    "it is worth pausing here for a moment to consider the dirichlet laplacian results relevant to our main result .",
    "the first such result is the li - yau inequality that provides a lower bound for the sums of eigenvalues , sharp in the sense of weyl asymptotics @xcite .",
    "the authors generalized this result in @xcite by obtaining the following li - yau type inequality for the eigenvalues of the diriclet fractional laplacian operator : @xmath31 where @xmath32 represents the volume of @xmath8 and @xmath33 denotes the gamma function @xmath34 for @xmath35 one may also look at @xcite for a li - yau type inequality involving the eigenvalues of the ( massless ) klein  gordon square root operators @xmath36 , ( i.e. , the case @xmath22 ) . to look at this inequality from a different perspective , one may take the legendre transform of the following result by laptev @xcite and obtain : @xmath37 when we set @xmath23 in , we recover an earlier result by berezin @xcite , which supplies the li - yau inequality after an application of the legendre transform .",
    "thus , in what follows , we call as the berezin - li - yau inequality .    in @xcite , melas proved the following improvement to the berezin - li - yau inequality ( @xmath23 ) : @xmath38 where @xmath39 , the moment of inertia , is defined by @xmath40 by a translation of the origin and a rotation of axes if necessary , in the sequel , we assume that the origin is the center of mass of @xmath8 and that @xmath41 melas type bounds and their many variants and extensions have recently attracted a lot of attention , see for instance @xcite . in particular , in @xcite , the authors obtained a refinement of , stating that @xmath42 remark that @xmath23 in recovers melas bound in @xcite for the dirichlet laplacian eigenvalues .",
    "unfortunately , it is not easy to take legendre transform of to find a similar improved berezin type bound in the case of the fractional laplacian .    for @xmath43 , authors also proved in @xcite that @xmath44 the main purpose of this article is to obtain analogous but sharper bounds with dirichlet laplacian replaced by dirichlet fractional laplacian .",
    "the first step , inspired by results in @xcite , is establishing the following result :    [ impbly ] for @xmath45 , and either @xmath46 and @xmath47 or @xmath48 and @xmath49 the eigenvalues @xmath13 of the fractional laplacian operator defined on @xmath50 satisfy @xmath51    note that the constants in the leading terms on the right side of , which is a fractional version of weyl s law , are optimal due to a classical result of blumenthal and getoor @xcite .",
    "while the constant in the second term in is still sub - optimal , the estimate in is substantially stronger than previous known results in @xcite .",
    "in addition , we recover the lower bounds in the case of the dirichlet laplacian @xcite when we set @xmath23 in .",
    "in @xcite , chen and song obtained that @xmath52 for each @xmath53 and any constant @xmath54 $ ] .",
    "thus , proposition [ impbly ] along with an application of leads to our principal result :    [ impblyt ] for @xmath45 , @xmath55 and either @xmath46 and @xmath47 or @xmath48 and @xmath49 the eigenvalues @xmath13 of the fractional laplacian operator defined on @xmath50 satisfy @xmath56    on a side note , the proof of proposition [ impbly ] consists of a very delicate application of steffensen s type inequalities , which is mainly about the comparison of the integrals on the subsets of interval @xmath57 .",
    "the article is structured as follows : in section [ sec : bly2 ] , we revisit the relevant facts about the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the fractional laplacian operator . after providing the proof of an auxilliary lemma that plays a crucial role in proving proposition [ impbly ] , we present the proof of our main results in section [ sec : impbly ] . finally , we end section [ sec : impbly ] with a remark which extends the main result even further for some elliptic operators studied in @xcite .",
    "please see remark [ rmkgen ] for details .",
    "in this section , we give an overview of the definitions and tools that are essential to establish the estimates in . even though , these were previously studied in @xcite , we include them so that the article is self - contained . by using plancherel s theorem , one can show that the set of fourier transforms @xmath58 of @xmath59 forms an orthonormal set in @xmath60 since the set of eigenfunctions @xmath59 is an orthonormal set in @xmath61 to ease the notation , we set @xmath62 because the support of @xmath63 is @xmath64 the integral is taken over @xmath8 instead of @xmath65 .",

    "note that @xmath72 in view of h \" older s inequality and utilizing and , we arrive at the following uniform bound : @xmath73 let @xmath74 designate the ball of radius @xmath75 centered at @xmath76 in @xmath65 and @xmath77 denotes the volume of @xmath78 dimensional unit ball @xmath79 in @xmath65 given by @xmath80 now assume that @xmath75 is such that @xmath81 .",

    "before diving into the proof of the main results , we present the following surprising sharper inequality which will be the main ingredient in the proof of the sharper lower bound in .",
