    "collisional evolution of many - body astrophysical systems in which the relative velocity between colliding objects is large compared to the escape speed and coagulation is unimportant is dominated by fragmentation .",
    "examples of such systems include the asteroid belt @xcite , the kuiper belt @xcite , and debris disks around young stars @xcite .",
    "as the large bodies are slowly ground down , a collisional cascade is launched , in which mass flows unidirectionally to smaller objects until at some scale it is flushed out of the system by some removal process ( e.g. by poynting - robertson drag , radiation pressure , or gas drag ) .    in real astrophysical systems there is normally a large dynamic range between the scale @xmath0 at which mass is injected into the cascade and the scale @xmath1 at which mass is removed from the system .",
    "the mass @xmath0 can be defined as the mass for which the collisional destruction timescale is comparable to the age of the system . in highly evolved systems , such as the kuiper belt , this scale corresponds to the characteristic mass of the largest bodies @xcite .",
    "the collision time for the smallest bodies is usually much shorter than for the largest ones , so a steady - state can be set up for @xmath2 .",
    "in such a steady - state , the mass distribution of particles evolves on the collision timescale of bodies at the injection mass scale and can be considered static on shorter timescales .",
    "@xcite was the first to construct a model of a fragmentation cascade that aimed at explaining the mass distribution of objects in the asteroid belt .",
    "he assumed that the internal strength of colliding objects is independent of mass with the implication that @xmath3 , which we define as the mass of the smallest projectile capable of dispersing one half the mass of a target of mass @xmath4 to infinity , has its mass linearly proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "dohnanyi also assumed that @xmath5 , the mass of the largest fragment produced in a collision between a target of mass @xmath4 and a projectile of mass @xmath6 , scales linearly with @xmath4 and is independent of @xmath6 . under these assumptions",
    ", he showed that a fragmentation cascade allows a steady - state power law solution n(m)m^- ,  = -11/6 [ eq : pl ] where @xmath7 is the number of objects in the size distribution with mass between @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "later , @xcite generalized dohnanyi s result by assuming a self - similar model of fragmentation , which again entails @xmath10 , but now @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is an arbitrary function .",
    "they confirmed the power law form of the mass spectrum and showed that the value of @xmath13 is determined by the mass dependence of the collision rate and that @xmath13 reduces to @xmath14 if the collision rate is proportional to @xmath15 ( geometrical cross - section with mass - independent relative velocities ) .",
    "in reality , however , fragmentation does not have to be self - similar because the minimum energy necessary for disruption is not always linearly proportional to the target mass .",
    "for instance , if an object s internal strength is dominated by gravity , then @xmath16 , the energy per unit mass required to shatter an object and disperse half of its mass to infinity , scales as @xmath17 , which is the case for objects larger than @xmath18 km @xcite . @xcite",
    "considered a model in which @xmath16 scales as a power law in @xmath4 , but took @xmath19 linearly proportional to @xmath4 . under these assumptions , @xcite found that a steady - state power law solution for @xmath20 still exists , but that @xmath13 differs from @xmath14 unless @xmath16 is constant , even when the collision rate scales as @xmath15 .",
    "the steady - state power law solutions of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have since been confirmed numerous times by simulations , which have also shed light on non - power law effects present in astrophysical fragmentation cascades . these effects typically manifest themselves as waves superimposed on top of the steady - state power law solution and are caused either by non - collisional mass sinks , e.g. due to the removal of small particles ( @xmath21 @xmath22 m for @xmath23 ) by radiation pressure @xcite ; a change in the power law index of @xmath24 induced by a transition from the strength - dominated to the gravity - dominated regime @xcite ; or a transition from a primordial to a collisionally - evolved size distribution @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we describe a new source of non - power law behavior in fragmentation cascades .",
    "we consider a model similar to the one used by @xcite , but with a more general form for @xmath19 .",
    "more specifically , previous researchers @xcite have typically assumed that @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the kinetic energy of the colliding particles in the center of mass frame , and @xmath27 is a function that varies from author to author .",
    "we instead consider the more general dependence @xmath28 , which is motivated in  [ setup ] .",
    "we find that unless @xmath29 , there is no steady - state power law solution .",
    "instead , @xmath20 is described by a power law with the same power law index as found by @xcite , but multiplied by a slowly varying function of mass ( i.e. @xmath30 ) .",
    "the non - power law effects caused by the slowly varying function show up as a smooth deviation from power - law behavior , which is quite different from the wave - like features described earlier .",
    "this deviation is significant when extrapolating over many orders of magnitude in mass , as demonstrated in ",
    "[ subsect : applications ] .    in the course of our investigation",
    ", we have also discovered that it is possible for waves to appear and persist in a collisional cascade , even if the particle size distribution does not contain an upper or lower mass cutoff , and the strength is described by a pure power law with no breaks .",
    "this is a completely independent type of non - power law behavior from the one caused by @xmath19 not proportional to @xmath4 . in astrophysical systems",
    ", such waves may be triggered by stochastic collision events between large planetesimals @xcite .",
    "however , the main focus of our paper is on the non - power law behavior that results when @xmath19 is not proportional to @xmath4 , and we defer a detailed discussion of these waves for the future .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ setup ] , we introduce the general equations describing fragmentation and discuss specific assumptions relevant to our model . in  [ pls ] we demonstrate that pure power law solutions for a fragmentation cascade are indeed possible if @xmath31 , consistent with @xcite .",
    "we show in  [ nonpl ] that if the assumption @xmath32 is not satisfied , then solutions are given by the product of a power law with the same index as in the @xmath32 case , and a slowly varying function of mass .",
    "we then find analytic solutions for this slowly varying function for monodisperse ( all fragments having the same mass ) and power law fragment mass distributions .",
    "we find that in the monodisperse case , the solutions for the steady - state distribution are not unique and can support waves .",
    "we confirm our analytical results numerically in  [ numerical ] and discuss their validity and possible applications in ",
    "[ discussion ] .",
    "the number density distribution of particles in mass space , @xmath20 , obeys the continuity equation @xcite : + = 0 , [ eq : continuity ] where the mass flux , @xmath33 is defined to be the amount of mass which flows past a point @xmath8 in mass space per unit time .",
    "we will consider the evolution of the mass spectrum for @xmath34 in which case we can adopt the steady - state assumption . under this assumption",

    "( [ eq : fujiw ] ) , these authors used & & ( ) ^- , [ ereleq ] here , @xmath281 is the energy per unit mass required to shatter an object , but not necessarily to disperse its fragments to infinity @xcite . if we assume for simplicity that @xmath282 , then from eq .",

    "( [ eq : fujiw ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ ereleq ] ) ) is because their experiments were performed over a small range of target masses using a constant projectile mass .",
    "the question of how to properly extend their results over a larger mass range can best be settled by more experiments and simulations @xcite , which can decisively answer how @xmath83 varies with mass .",
    "however , we point out that unless @xmath83 is exactly proportional to @xmath4 , non - power law behavior will result . as we show in the next section",
    ", these deviations from power law behavior can be observationally significant when extrapolating over many orders of magnitude in mass .",
    "our results clearly demonstrate that one should be somewhat cautious when adopting a pure power law approximation to describe the properties of fragmentation cascades . even though the non - power law corrections computed in this work scale very weakly with object mass ( as the square root of the logarithm of the mass ( eq .",
    "( [ phimbm ] ) ) ) , one has to keep in mind that in astrophysical systems collisional cascades span @xmath283 orders of magnitude in mass .",
    "thus , even a weak deviation from a power law can become important , such as when inferring the disk mass ( dominated by the largest bodies ) from its infrared luminosity ( dominated by the smallest bodies ) @xcite .    just for illustration ,",
    "let us consider a population of @xmath284 km objects which get ground down to @xmath2851 @xmath22 m size particles by collisions .",
    "infrared observations give us some idea of the mass in small particles , thus fixing the normalization of the mass spectrum at its low - mass end , and we want to infer from these data the total mass in large bodies feeding this collisional cascade .",
    "connecting the mass contained at the low and high mass ends of the spectrum by a simple power law leads to an error caused by the neglect of the non - power law effects . we can estimate this error @xmath286 by using eq .",
    "( [ phimbm ] ) and taking the ratio of @xmath217 at the high and low mass ends . assuming some values of @xmath22 and @xmath101 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : m0b ] ) that are `` averaged '' over the whole cascade ( in practice these parameters will change several times between @xmath287 and @xmath288 because of variations in the internal properties of objects ) , we have = , where @xmath289 is the radius of the object with mass @xmath265 defined in  [ subsect : mb = m ] .",
    "assuming for illustration that on `` average '' @xmath290 and that at the high mass end the largest fragments produced in collisions have mass equal to @xmath291 of the target mass ( @xmath292 ) one finds @xmath293 and @xmath294 .",
    "thus , in this particular exercise the neglect of non - power law effects leads to an _ underestimate _ of the mass in large bodies by a factor of several .",
    "this also implies that the total disk mass , which is dominated by the mass in large bodies , is underestimated .",
    "an underestimate of the disk mass also leads to an underestimate of the disk lifetime , @xmath295 .",
    "this occurs because if the disk is in steady - state , then @xmath33 is independent of @xmath8 , which means it is possible to infer @xmath296 from infrared observations alone , without extrapolation to large masses @xcite .",
    "supposing that we had correctly inferred @xmath296 from observations , but had failed to apply the non - power law correction , and hence underestimated the disk mass , then we would also have underestimated the disk lifetime .",
    "based on the above discussion , breaking the assumption @xmath93 affects the calculation of disk properties from observations .",
    "conversely , observations of disks can be used to constrain the model parameters ( i.e. @xmath22 and @xmath101 if @xmath83 is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : m0b ] ) ) , if e.g. the inferred disk mass is found to be unreasonable for some parameter range . however , as mentioned in ",
    "[ subsect : compare ] , direct application of our theoretical results to the observed mass spectrum of objects is complicated by the multitude of additional factors playing an important role in real astrophysical systems",
    ". nevertheless , modern calculations @xcite of the collisional evolution in the asteroid belt and of debris disks @xcite aim for a precision of tens of percent or less over a broad range of masses . at this level of accuracy",
    ", the non - power law effects considered in this work would play a significant role and should be taken into account .",
    "we have shown that unless @xmath297 , where @xmath83 is the mass of the largest fragment produced in a collision with just enough energy to disperse half of the target s mass , @xmath4 , to infinity , a steady - state power law solution for the mass distribution , @xmath20 , is not possible .",
    "the non - power law behavior is weak , however , and the solution for @xmath20 becomes the product of a power law and a much more slowly varying function of the mass : @xmath298 , @xmath299 .",
    "this slowly varying function is equal to a constant when @xmath297 , and the fact that previous researchers @xcite have assumed just such a dependence of @xmath72 , explains why this kind of non - power law behavior was not observed earlier .",
    "when @xmath72 is not proportional to @xmath4 , @xmath20 deviates smoothly away from a pure power law , with the deviation only becoming significant when considering many orders of magnitude in mass .",
    "this is quite different from the wavy non - power law behavior resulting from either a lower cutoff to the mass distribution due to the ejection of small particles by radiation pressure @xcite , a transition from a collisionally - evolved to a primordial size distribution @xcite , or a break in the power law index of the strength law @xcite .",
    "the non - power law behavior we describe in this work is significant when extrapolating over many orders of magnitude in mass , such as when inferring the number of large bodies in a system based on infrared observations @xcite .",
    "for instance , assuming @xmath300 , a deviation of only @xmath301 in the power law index from the usual assumption of @xmath297 results in a factor of @xmath302 correction when inferring the number of @xmath303 km bodies from observations of dust .",
    "we have quantified precisely the effect of the non - power law behavior on the mass distribution by obtaining analytical solutions for @xmath122 in the case of a power law fragment mass distribution with @xmath201 , and a monodisperse fragment mass distribution ( all fragments the same size ) with @xmath304 .",
    "we have also provided a general framework for solving the @xmath305 case with an arbitrary fragment mass distribution . in all cases considered ,",
    "our analytical solutions were confirmed numerically , and we noticed that the simple expression ( [ phimbm ] ) captures the essence of the non - power law behavior for a wide range of parameters in our model .",
    "in the course of our investigation , we have also found an entirely different type of non - power law behavior .",
    "namely , we have discovered that fragmentation cascades can support wavy , steady - state solutions , even when there is no upper or lower mass cutoff , and the strength law is given by a pure power law .",
    "our results were derived for the monodisperse case , but such waves may also be able to persist for more realistic fragment mass distributions . in astrophysical systems ,",
    "these kinds of waves could be triggered in stochastic collisions between large planetesimals that generate enough collisional debris to significantly alter @xmath20 .",

    "we describe here the numerical algorithm we use to study fragmentation .",
    "we differ from the main text here in that our algorithm evolves the differential number density of particles @xmath368 per unit radius , rather than particle mass , but it is straightforward to convert between @xmath20 and @xmath368 .    the evolution equation for @xmath368 can be written as the sum of a source term ( denoted by a plus sign ) and a sink term ( denoted by a minus sign ) : @xmath369 the sink term is simply given by the number of catastrophic collisions that particles with radius @xmath370 are undergoing per unit time . dropping the dependence on time for brevity (",
    "everything is evaluated at time @xmath157 ) and ignoring erosion , we can write @xmath371 where @xmath372 is the minimum particle size that can fragment a particle of radius @xmath370 , @xmath373 is defined analogously to @xmath374 , and we have assumed that the particle cross - section is the geometric cross - section , and that the impact velocity is a constant  [ simplifications ] .    for the source term , we will first state the equation and then analyze it piece by piece : @xmath375 here , we have used @xmath376 to denote a target and @xmath377 a projectile with the possibility that @xmath378 .",
    "now , @xmath379 gives the number of collisions ( per unit volume per unit time ) between targets in the range @xmath376 to @xmath380 and projectiles in the range @xmath377 to @xmath381 .",
    "we define @xmath382 to be the number of fragments in the size range @xmath370 to @xmath383 from destruction of the target particle only .",
    "then @xmath384 gives the particle flux into the range @xmath370 to @xmath385 from targets in the range @xmath376 to @xmath380 that have been shattered by projectiles in the range @xmath377 to @xmath381 .",
    "then , we simply integrate this expression over all values of @xmath386 and all values of @xmath377 , which yield a catastrophic fragmentation event ( i.e. an event in which both the target and the projectile are destroyed ) .",
    "a useful simplification of eq . ( [ source ] ) can be obtained if we assume that the distribution of fragments is independent of the projectile size so that @xmath387 . in this case , which is adopted for the numerical calculations in this work (  [ numerical ] ) , equation ( [ source ] ) becomes @xmath388 and comparing with eq .",
    "[ sink ] we see that we can write @xmath389 this is a useful form of the source equation when it comes to computations , because it reduces a double integral to a single integral , once the sink term has been calculated .    given a starting distribution for @xmath368 and a form for @xmath390 ( e.g. monodisperse , power law , etc . ) , it is possible to evolve the distribution forward in time using discretized versions of eq .",

    "the integrals in these equations are performed using standard numerical integration techniques , such as the trapezoid or simpson s rule .",

    "a timestep must be specified .",
    "a good criterion is to set it to a fixed fraction of the shortest collision time in the simulation .",
    "this ensures that the particle size distribution can never become negative .",
    "another problem is dealing with the boundaries of the simulation .",
    "the upper boundary is generally not problematic since the collision time there is long compared to the rest of the simulation , and the maximum particle size can be chosen to be as large as necessary for there to be negligible variation in the particle mass distribution at the high mass end . the lower boundary , however , can be a problem if @xmath396 there . in this case ,",
