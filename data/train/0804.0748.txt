    "a similar series of events as in water can even be observed when a steel ball impacts on very fine and soft sand ( @xcite ) .",
    "+ although in some of the literature the deceleration of the impacting body was minimized by choosing the properties of the body such that the velocity of the impactor remained roughly constant during the time the cavity dynamics were observed ( @xcite ) , the velocity of the body nevertheless remained a response parameter set by the system .",
