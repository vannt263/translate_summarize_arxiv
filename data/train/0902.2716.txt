    "hii galaxies ( hiigs ) are dwarf galaxies undergoing a burst of star formation . their extensive star - forming regions , composed of an ensemble of super star clusters ( ssc ) and giant hii regions ( ghiirs ) , dominate the optical emission .",
    "hiigs represent the simplest examples of the starburst phenomenon occurring on galactic scales .",
    "ii zw 40 is one of the most famous hiig showing an intense starburst in its central region .",
    "its optical spectrum is dominated by very intense emission lines of h , he , [ o ii ] , [ o iii ] , [ n ii ] , [ s ii ] and [ ne iii ] superposed on a faint blue continuum , indicating that the present rate of star formation ( sf ) is much higher than the historical average @xcite .",
    "ii zw 40 has a subsolar oxygen abundance of 12+log(o / h)=8.07 from the data of @xcite , typical of this class .",
    "the star formation ( sf ) history of this galaxy has been the object of several studies , ranging from the hypothesis that the star - forming episode may be producing a first generation of stars , to a scenario in which the history of sf consists of a continuous series of short bursts over its lifetime . near infrared spectra",
    "have been obtained by @xcite , who showed that ii zw 40 has low supernova rate and that no nuclear starburst , as powerful as the present one , has occurred in the past giga - year . @xcite and @xcite found wolf - rayet ( wr ) features in the optical spectrum , confirming that the central region is very young ( 3 - 6 myr ) .",
    "@xcite found that the bright central region concentrate 75% of the thermal free - free emission and that the 75 pc region is formed by four supernebula each powered by @xmath4 600 o stars . @xcite also found no radio supernovae with powers greater than cas a.    the initial trigger of the present sf episode is also a question that remains unanswered for this class of dwarf starbursts since most are isolated systems @xcite . if not triggered by external agents ( i.e. interactions ) , star formation is caused by internal processes manifesting in a stochastic manner @xcite .",
    "this may be the case for the subsample of low luminosity , compact objects , classified as type ii hii galaxies by @xcite , with no signs of morphological disturbances .",
    "however , the more luminous hii galaxies , classified as type i , do show some signs of extensions , fuzz , or tails in their outer envelopes , suggesting tidal origin . over the years",
    ", only a few studies have been carried out to determine the overall dynamics of ii zw 40 .",
    "hi velocity mapping reveals complex structure with a subtle velocity gradient @xcite . the southeast and",
    "northwest hi tails have reversal rotation , suggesting that most of the material is falling back toward the dynamical center .",
    "the best scenario for the formation of ii zw 40 seems to be the result a collision between two gas - rich dwarf galaxies , and the current starburst occurs in the overlapping merging region @xcite .    in the early 70 s , @xcite first discovered broad [ oiii ] and balmer lines in ghiirs .",
    "these lines have widths which are broader ( i.e. line of sight velocity dispersion @xmath8 ) than those found in normal hii regions in the galaxy , e.g. @xmath2 @xmath4 5.4 km s@xmath5 in orion @xcite .",
    "these high velocity widths imply gas motions a few times the speed of sound .",
    "the early detailed studies suggested that winds from wr stars should contribute to the total kinetic energy in mass motions @xcite , and that supernova remnants ( snrs ) could play a significant role in the energetic balance of ghiirs @xcite .    in the meantime",
    ", @xcite showed a correlation between the diameter and the global h@xmath0 profile widths of ghiirs .",
    "@xcite found l(h@xmath9 which led them to propose a gravitational model for the origin of the supersonic motions , due to the close similarities with the parametric relations found for systems in dynamical equilibrium , such as elliptical galaxies , globular clusters and bulges of spiral galaxies .",
    "the first extrapolation to hiigs was done by @xcite , where a significant sample of galaxies was observed , including ii zw 40 .",
    "recent work also confirms the existence of the @xmath10-@xmath2 relation for hiigs , suggesting that ghiirs and the star - forming regions in hiigs belong to a single family of objects @xcite .",
    "several line broadening mechanisms have been proposed to interpret the supersonic widths measured in the spectra of ghiirs  and hiigs .",
    "@xcite proposes that line profiles consist of two components : one broad line component of the shocked region , and a narrower component originated in the neighboring region which is ionized by uv photons escaping from the broad line region .",
    "the broad line emission is likely to arise near the shell of a hot ( @xmath11k ) highly ionized , wind - driven bubble .",
    "@xcite used the champagne flow model @xcite  disruption of neutral clouds adjacent to hii regions to explain the broad lines .",
    "the gravitational model @xcite is based on the assumption that the dominant influence is the gravitational potential . in this model ,",
    "the observed gaussian line profiles are a direct consequence of the virialized motions of the gas plus stars complex . if one supposes a _ self gravitating _ system , the standard deviation of this gaussian profile in velocity is @xmath12    the cometary stirring model ( csm ) proposed later by @xcite improves the simpler original picture .",
    "they propose that a group of pre - main - sequence low - mass stars of a recently formed starburst , move under the gravitational potential with velocity dispersion @xmath13 .",
    "these stars drive winds that stir the remaining cloud through supersonic bow , or `` cometary '' , shocks , providing it with an average turbulent motion @xmath14 @xmath4 @xmath13 .",
    "this model estimates the total power of the shocks and associated line the luminosity which agree with the observed relation l @xmath4 @xmath15 .",
    "few attempts have been made ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and none with a statistically significant sample , to definitely test the hypothesis of @xmath16 which would strengthen the support for this model .",
    "a skeptical view of this scenario was presented by @xcite in a detailed study of the ghiir 30 doradus in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "they showed that a smooth integrated velocity profile in the inner region ( 135 @xmath17 135 pc ) results from a complex velocity field , which demonstrates the futility of using global velocity profiles to infer the physical origin of the gas motion .",
    "the dominant contributor to the global velocity dispersion , as proposed by the authors , at least in the bright core , is the superposition of individual expanding shells .",
    "consequently , the most important physical mechanisms would be the stellar winds from ob associations combined with champagne - type flows and possibly supernovae .",
    "this long disagreement in the literature has also been enlightened by works favored by high spectral , spatial as well as bi - dimensional spectroscopy of ghiirs  and the nearest hiigs .",
    "@xcite analyzed the velocity field of ngc 604 and ngc 588 in the galaxy m33 .",
    "they show that , in both cases , the peaks of high velocity dispersions are systematically concentrated in regions of faint nebular emission . on the other hand",
    ", there is a smooth low velocity dispersion component which permeates all regions of the nebula .",
    "they proposed a simple criterion to identify expanding shells in the intensity vs. @xmath2 diagram .",
    "this smooth low velocity dispersion component is what one measures in the integrated spectrum of a ghiir .",
    "@xcite came up with basically the same conclusions in a similar study of ngc 604 .",
    "the results found by @xcite using echelle long - slit spectroscopy of a small sample of hiigs point in the same direction . despite the complex velocity fields found in such objects ,",
    "they show that the brightest knots dominate the global luminosity and velocity dispersion . though much effort has been spent to understand the kinematics of the gas - stars complex in ghiirs and hiigs , a clear picture is still absent , given the complexity of these systems .",
    "the puzzle can be noted in the follow question : _ why should one find such parametric relations in these violent environments where massive star evolution seems to play a significant , maybe dominant , role ?",
    "_ here , we aim to bring some insight to this question by extending the bi - dimensional spectroscopy study of local ghiirs to this nearby prototypical hiig , with comparable spatial and spectral resolution .",
    "the kinematics of the ionized gas in the very center of ii zw 40 is investigated in some detail .",
    "ii zw 40 has coordinates r.a . 05@xmath18",
    "55@xmath19 42@xmath20.6 , dec .",
    "+ 03@xmath21 23@xmath19 32@xmath22 ( j2000.0 ) , a v = 15 mag @xcite .",
    "it lies at a low galactic latitude of @xmath23 degrees . the observed radial velocity of 778   and a cosmological ( corrected from heliocentric to cosmic microwave background frame ) recession velocity of 845 , puts it at a distance of 11.9 mpc .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ observations ] describes the observations and reduction procedures .",
    "the results are presented in   [ results ] together with full descriptive data analysis . in   [ discussion ]",
    "we discuss our results .",
    "finally , we give a brief summary in ",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "the observations of ii zw 40 were done during the run gn-2003b - q-26 on 2003 december 26 .",
    "we used gmos equipped with an integral field unit ( ifu ) on the gemini - north telescope .",
    "the ifu was used in one - slit mode giving a 3.5 @xmath17 5 arcsec@xmath24 field of view . each lens in its original hexagonal shape has 0.2@xmath22 nominal size projected in the sky . in this case , the ifu directed to the science target has 20 @xmath17 25 lenses , in a total of 500 lenses . a set of 249 lenses , 1 arcmin away from the science target , provides a sky background for subtraction during the data reduction .",
    "in order to cover a larger field , we exposed at six different offsets overlapping the fields about 1@xmath22 . figure  [ fig1 ] shows the acs / hst high resolution h@xmath0 image ( 0.027 arcsec / pixel ) , with the different fields observed with gmos / ifu shown as rectangles over the image .",
    "the gmos / ifu data were recorded in three 2048 @xmath17 4608 ccds with 13.5@xmath25 m pixel size .",
    "we used the r831 grating covering the wavelength range 5970 - 8080 and providing a spectral resolution of 1.5 ( fwhm ) at 6580 , with corresponding @xmath26 = 29.0@xmath271.0 km s@xmath5 ( @xmath2=fwhm/2.355 ) .",
    "the exposure time of each field was 300 seconds .",
    "the seeing remained constantly sub - arcsecond during the observations ( @xmath28 0.5 - 0.6@xmath22 ) .",
    "the basic data reduction was performed using the gemini iraf package developed by the gemini observatory staff .",
    "a cuar spectrum was obtained in order to provide the wavelength calibration .",
    "we processed bias subtraction , dome and twilight flat field correction .",
    "each field was calibrated in wavelength but not in flux .",
    "the final cube for each field was re - sampled to 0.2 arcsec per pixel using gfcube , resulting in a 16 @xmath17 25 @xmath17 6270 data cube .",
    "we developed a special procedure using iraf in order to produce the h@xmath0 emission , radial velocity and velocity dispersion synthetic maps .",
    "for each data cube we used the task fitprofs in _ onedspec _ package to fit a single gaussian profile to the h@xmath0 emission line .",
    "the task provides the h@xmath0 central wavelength , the fwhm and the integrated intensity in relative counts .",
    "we run the task automatically for all spectra in the original sampling ( 0.2@xmath22 hexagonal spaxel ) and re - sampled ( 0.2@xmath22/pixel ) data cubes .",
    "there is no difference using either data sets , nevertheless , it is more practical for the analysis to use the re - sampled square pixel data cubes .",
    "we constructed fits images using h@xmath0 line intensities , centers and fwhm values to build our final maps .",
    "finally , we overlapped them to build the mosaiced field .",
    "as an additional test , the different maps were also produced from the original data cube using the adhoc package @xcite in a parallel reduction procedure in order to check the accuracy of the data reduction .",
    "this package is designed to reduce fabry - perot interferometry data and is able to handle any data cube .",
    "both reductions showed very similar maps , then we decided to use the maps produced with the iraf routines for all our further analysis .",
    "figure  [ spec ] shows a spectrum of a single pixel on the brightest region on the main knot of ii zw 40 nebula ( knot a ) . this one pixel spectrum illustrates the quality of our data , and shows that we are able to detect , resolve and measure faint lines of [ oi]@xmath296300 , [ siii]@xmath296312 , [ nii]@xmath306548,6584 , hei@xmath296678 , [ sii]@xmath306717,6731 , [ nei]@xmath297024 , hei@xmath297065 , [ ariii]@xmath297136 , hei@xmath297281 , [ oii]@xmath307318 , [ oii]@xmath307330 , and [ ariii]@xmath297751(not shown ) .",
    "the peak intensity of h@xmath0 in this one single pixel exceeds 7000 counts and with a total flux of 20000 counts .",
    "the s / n on the continuum around h@xmath0 ( which is not of interest here ) is about 5 on this one pixel spectrum . on the fainter regions , where the line widths are still measurable , the s /",
    "n on the adjacent continuum is about 0.5 , and what determines the accuracy of the line width measurement is the peak intensity over the continuum which is directly proportional to the total flux of the emission line . we estimated , therefore , a conservative minimum relative flux necessary to accurately measure a single h@xmath0 line width of 300 counts ( log f = 2.5 ) .",
    "the single gaussian fit is an operational measurement procedure .",
    "though the major contribution comes from regions presenting line profiles well fitted by single gaussians , some regions of the nebula show asymmetric line profiles or multiple components .",
    "these measurements can map regions of kinematic interest through line width variations , and can reveal large scale motions through variations of the line centroids across the nebula .",
    "when one has sufficient high spectral resolution the analysis of a single line profile can provide additional information constraining the larger and the smaller scale velocity variations .",
    "we briefly comment on the distribution of some derived physical properties before we proceed with the main topic of the kinematic properties of the starburst region in ii zw 40 . we have been able to reliably measure and map the distribution of some weak lines in the central field .",
    "figure  [ sii ] shows the electron density ( n@xmath31 ) distribution derived from the ratio of [ sii]@xmath306717,6731 lines @xcite .",
    "this plot was produced by azimuthally averaging the 2d map centered on the peak distribution of the sulfur line ratio which is coincident with the peak h@xmath0 line emission from knot a. firstly , we show that n@xmath31 is not constant and ranges from @xmath41400 @xmath32 in the center to @xmath4 500 @xmath32 about 100 pc from the center of knot a , and higher than the low density limit of 100 @xmath32 .",
    "it is also noticeable the good fit to a r@xmath33 law ( solid line ) to the outer points ( avoiding the dominant effect of seeing in the center represented by the dotted line ) , which is usually representative of the surface brightness distribution of stellar systems in dynamical equilibrium .",
    "figure  [ o_h ] shows the oxygen abundance distribution in this central field .",
    "h@xmath0 and continuum emission are also plotted as contours over the image .",
    "all pixels with h@xmath0 emission less than 3.4% of the peak emission were erased .",
    "the o / h abundance was derived by applying the n2 calibrator from @xcite .",
    "this is an empirical relation between the the line ratio of [ nii]@xmath296584/h@xmath0 with the oxygen abundance .",
    "simple closed box chemical evolution models considering the primary and secondary origin of nitrogen predict this linear correlation between nitrogen and oxygen , though dependent on the ionization parameter . here",
    ", we simply apply the empirical calibration of this relation .",
    "we found a lower abundance over knot a , 12+log(o / h ) = 7.85 , a slight increase over knot b , 12+log(o / h ) = 8.0 and a significant increase in a region at ne of the knot a , 12+log(o / h ) = 8.3 .",
    "the statistical error of the n2 estimator is @xmath34 , however relative differences between the regions should be real",
    ".    we will not explore the physical conditions analysis here any further .",
    "however , we may say that we have not found any relation between the velocity dispersion and the oxygen abundance or n@xmath31 .",
    "we now compare the integrated line width for the main starburst region in ii zw 40 derived here , with the inner core line width obtained with the high dispersion fiber spectrograph feros @xcite , on the 1.52 m telescope ( eso ) .",
    "we combined 181 spectra from our gmos data cube , around the inner core in a synthetic aperture of a diameter of 2.7@xmath22 ( equivalent to 150 pc ) which corresponds to the feros fiber diameter .",
    "figure  [ feros ] shows the line profiles , their single gaussian fits and the velocity dispersions derived from the data of these two very different instruments .",
    "our simulated spectrum from gmos / ifu data shows an observed fwhm = 2.34 , while the feros spectrum shows fwhm = 1.83 .",
    "after the respective instrumental broadening , and the thermal broadening corrections ( for @xmath35 = 10@xmath36k , fwhm@xmath37 = 0.47 or @xmath38 = 9.1 ) , the velocity dispersions derived were virtually the same , @xmath2 = 34 .",
    "ii zw 40 presents an integrated supersonic line width with a derived high velocity dispersion reaching 34 , which is significantly higher than 30 dor with @xmath3926 , the most powerful ghiir of our local group , @xcite .",
    "the h@xmath0 flux monochromatic map is a result of the emission line intensity measurements across the observed field .",
    "we fitted single gaussians to the h@xmath0 line profiles to derive their respective total fluxes , using the procedure discussed in section  [ observations ] . the h@xmath0 monochromatic ( total flux from the single gaussian fit )",
    "contour map is presented superposed on the velocity dispersion and radial velocity maps ( figures  [ disp ] and  [ vel ] ) in six contours levels ( 68 , 20 , 9 , 5 , 3.4 and 2.6% of the peak intensity ) .",
    "the overall h@xmath0 distribution in the synthetic map obtained from gmos / ifu agrees very well with the narrow band h@xmath0 image from acs / hst at higher resolution ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) . in the hst s image it is possible to clearly resolve the two inner knots ( a and b ) , the cavities formed by low h@xmath0 emission maybe associated with superbubbles , and also some filaments .",
    "a synthetic red continuum image from our ifu data , shown here only in two contours in figure  [ o_h ] , also reveals the two inner knots , separated by projected distance of 1.6@xmath22 ( @xmath4 90 pc ) .",
    "however , the northern knot ( a ) is responsible for virtually all the ionizing luminosity in the core of ii zw 40 @xcite .",
    "the starburst region revealed in ii zw 40 , from the morphological point of view , is also very similar to the largest and extensively studied counterparts in the local group , such as 30 dor , ngc 588 and ngc 604 , showing complex kinematic features , along with filamentary structure , shells , and cavities , suggesting a common physical cause @xcite .",
    "the similarities of the properties of the ism in ghiirs and hiigs were first investigated through empirical relations of integrated physical parameters @xcite , particularly the fact that both exhibit supersonic motions of the warm interstellar medium .",
    "a more detailed analysis of spatially resolved properties of these structures will help us understand the interplay between the massive cluster formation and evolution with its surrounding interstellar medium on scales of tens to hundreds of parsec .",
    "the velocity dispersion map is presented in figure  [ disp ] , with h@xmath0 intensity contours superposed .",
    "the region corresponding to the brightest knot ( inner 50 pc ) presents a low to intermediate @xmath2 value ( 25 - 35 ) .",
    "there are , at least , three well defined high dispersion ( 45 - 65 km s@xmath5 ) regions @xmath4100 pc from the brightest knot .",
    "an almost constant velocity dispersion field ( @xmath40 35 ) , which contains most h@xmath0 contour levels , is present in a region with 100@xmath17100 pc@xmath24 at nw of the brightest knot .",
    "at least two regions of low velocity dispersion ( 15 - 25 ) are also found in the field , strikingly in between regions of high dispersion .",
    "a third low dispersion region is seen at extreme west , 300 pc far from the core , but we preferred to discard this from the analysis due to its low s",
    "/ n .    the observed h@xmath0 radial velocity map is shown in figure  [ vel ] .",
    "there is no sign of an overall rotation in the main starburst region of ii zw 40 (  500@xmath17500 pc@xmath24 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "discrete regions can reach high values of radial velocity , suggesting local expanding motions , although the total velocity range does not exceed 60 .",
    "an efficient method to identify kinematic features in ghiirs , detect the massive clusters , their effect on the ism , and their star formation rates , is by the analysis of the @xmath41-@xmath2 ( @xmath43-@xmath2 ) and @xmath41-@xmath42 ( @xmath43-@xmath3 ) diagrams @xcite .",
    "we present , in appendix  [ regss ] , a schematic illustration of these diagrams , and a brief description of how they were previously interpreted by @xcite .",
    "we also extend the analysis of these diagrams , including @xmath3-@xmath2 , to bring additional insight to the observed bulk motions .    in figure  [ int_sig ] ( left panel )",
    "we show the @xmath43-@xmath2 plot for the whole observed field . the plot for ii",
    "zw 40 shows exactly the same basic features found in previous work on ghiirs @xcite . in general low intensity regions",
    "have the highest @xmath2 values while the range of @xmath2 values decreases for high intensity regions . in the case of ii zw 40",
    ", there is a horizontal band defining a lower limit of @xmath44 @xmath45 25 km s@xmath5 for regions brighter than 4000 counts ( log f = 3.6 ) .",
    "the horizontal line in the @xmath43-@xmath2 plot shows the velocity dispersion of 33.5 km s@xmath5 derived from the integrated line profile with the 2.7@xmath22 aperture ( figure  [ feros ] left panel ) .",
    "it is a characteristic value for ii zw 40 found in all intensity regions .",
    "the inclined bands identified by @xcite are also identified in the plot .",
    "high velocity dispersions reach peaks of 65 km s@xmath5 in low intensity regions .",
    "as we will show in the next section , two inclined bands in this plot are superposed in the range 2.6 @xmath7 log f @xmath7 3.1 .",
    "some characteristic line profiles are also shown in figure  [ int_sig ] ( left panel ) .",
    "these are individual pixel profiles exemplifying the variety of shapes observed in different regions . profiles ( a ) and ( b ) are the most asymmetric profiles observed .",
    "they originate close to the center of the two regions of high dispersion at se and at sw of the brightest knot , respectively ( see figure  [ disp ] ) .",
    "they are clearly double - peak profiles , consistent with expanding motions . profile ( c ) originates in the second brightest knot and shows a prominent red wing .",
    "profile ( d ) originates in the brightest knot and profile ( e ) comes from the lowest dispersion region .",
    "figure  [ int_sig ] ( center panel ) presents the @xmath43-@xmath3 plot which shows the relative radial velocity variations .",
    "these motions are usually associated with the line broadening component named @xmath46 .",
    "the physical mechanisms at play which produce these line centroid variations should be several , such as turbulence , winds , champagne flows , expanding bubbles or rotation , acting on stellar radius scales to hundreds of parsecs .",
    "however , the estimate of the contribution of these subcomponents is limited to the spatial and espectral resolution of the observations . for instance , in this work we chose to associate the action of the spatially resolved bubbles , producing the highest radial velocity variations , to the component @xmath46 .",
    "the other mentioned mechanisms , however , should also contribute to produce the overall pattern in the @xmath43-@xmath3 plot .",
    "another line broadening component named @xmath47 will be here associated with the unresolved expanding shells identified as responsible for an underlying broad component found in the most inner region and discussed in section  [ intprof ] .",
    "therefore , the position - to - position motions found in figure  [ int_sig ] ( center panel ) contribute to the total broadening of an integrated line profile of the whole region .",
    "we do not intend to quantify precisely the contributions of the broadening components from the diagnostic diagrams . in the case of ii zw 40 ,",
    "the radial velocity differences are not higher than 15 km s@xmath5 in the brightest central region , and the highest differences are concentrated in low h@xmath0 intensity regions .",
    "we found that the discrete tails toward high intensity values shown in figure  [ int_sig ] ( center panel ) are associated with the presence of knot a ( main tail ) and b with a relative radial velocity of @xmath4 -13 km s@xmath5 .",
    "figure  [ int_sig ] ( right panel ) shows the @xmath3-@xmath2 plot . in the case of ii",
    "zw 40 , it suggests that the overall motions in the star forming region are primarily random , instead of dominated by systematic line of sight motions . for instance , if one was observing a highly collimated outflow toward the line of sight , as a champagne flow , one should expect to see a trend in this diagram .",
    "broad profiles from the low density regions should be found blueshifted , while narrow profiles from high density regions should be found redshifted , producing a pattern such as a narrow band with negative slope , not found for the whole region in figure  [ int_sig ] ( right panel ) . on other hand ,",
    "the most important result shown by this diagram is that low @xmath2 ( 15 - 25 ) regions have small radial velocity variations , suggesting that they are close to the rest frame of the galaxy .",
    "this is the first indication that these regions may be unperturbed by massive stellar evolution .",
    "we will try to associate the morphological features observed in the h@xmath0 flux , velocity and dispersion maps with the features from these diagnostic diagrams by choosing individual regions for a more detailed analysis below .",
    "the patterns shown in @xmath43-@xmath2 , @xmath43-@xmath3 and @xmath3-@xmath2 plots ( figure  [ int_sig ] ) re - display many of the features that can be observed in the maps ( figure  [ disp ] and figure  [ vel ] ) .",
    "we wish to evaluate the contribution of individual features to the integrated h@xmath0 line profile of ii zw 40 using the kinematic diagnostic diagrams . for this purpose",
    ", we defined eight regions with reliably measured @xmath2 and radial velocity .",
    "the choice of regions was arbitrary , but motivated by different peculiarities noted in the h@xmath0 flux , radial velocity and velocity dispersion maps .",
    "the chosen regions are superposed on these maps in figure  [ regions_map ] .    for each chosen region",
    ", we have plotted a set of four graphs .",
    "these graphs are presented in figure  [ regions ] in blocks of four boxes : ( a ) an integrated profile over the region in linear - logarithmic axes , where we also show the region number , the derived @xmath2 value , and the estimated skewness @xmath48 and kurtosis @xmath49 of each integrated profile , ( b ) @xmath43-@xmath2 , ( c ) @xmath43-@xmath3 , and ( d ) the @xmath3-@xmath2 plot .",
    "the vertical solid line in plots ( b ) and ( c ) shows our confidence limit in flux as described in section  [ observations ] .",
    "all references to the boxes in this section refer to figure  [ regions ] , where we quote the region number and the corresponding box letter , i.e. box ( 1a ) means plot ( a ) of region 1 in figure  [ regions ] .",
    "the results of the analysis of the emission line shapes through @xmath48 and @xmath49 estimates for each region will be presented in section  [ intprof ] .",
    "a brief description of each region follows :    * region 1 * was defined to cover the main and brightest h@xmath0 knot ( knot a ) as shown by the h@xmath0 map ( figure  [ regions_map ] left ) .",
    "it covers an area of 1.8@xmath22 @xmath17 1.6@xmath22 ( equivalent to 100 pc @xmath17 90 pc ) .",
    "the resultant integrated profile of region 1 is shown in box ( 1a ) , where the dashed and dotted lines represent the instrumental profile and the gaussian fit , respectively .",

    "the reason for this asymmetry is that @xmath2 reaches a local maximum in a few relative high intensity points ( north of knot b ) as shown by box ( 2b ) .",
    "moreover , the same high intensity points , seen in box ( 2c ) , have the largest recession velocities , resulting in this observed red wing . as a consequence ,",

    "box ( 3c ) confirms the expanding motion through the very high spread in radial velocity ( see figure  [ schem]b ) . the observed range of radial velocity , of about 20   above and below the average recession velocity should underestimate the real radial component",

    "our definitions of the regions favor the interpretation of the different patterns in @xmath43-@xmath2 diagrams where kinematic features are easily identified .",
    "thus , the patterns may be the result of different physical mechanisms .",
    "something to have in mind here , is our spatial resolution which only permits us to identify kinematic features in scales of a tens of parsec and limited by our field size .",

    "an important result is that the velocity dispersion derived from a single gaussian fit to the profile of region 1 ( figure  [ regions ] box 1a ) is virtually the same as those derived from the original feros spectrum with an aperture of 2.7 , and the simulated spectrum with the feros aperture on our gmos / ifu data ( figure  [ feros ] ) , and the fully integrated line profile ( figure  [ diag_int ] ) .",
    "region 1 represents 10% of the total area analyzed but 49% of the total h@xmath0 flux in all eight regions .",

    "if the same is valid for most hiigs and ghiirs , as has been confirmed , the measured supersonic @xmath2 , introduced in the @xmath10-@xmath2 relation , is little affected by the effects of snrs and wind driven bubbles where the warm gas emission is faint , and where the integrated velocity dispersion is much higher than in the central core .",

    ", @xcite proposed an evolutionary scenario when they compared their results of ngc 604 with ngc 588 .",
    "a simple model for an idealized homogeneous shell evolving in a uniform density medium suggests that younger and fast shells should have lower intensities and reach higher @xmath2 values than older ones .",
    "hence , the authors argue that ngc 604 appears to be younger than ngc 588 based on the inclined bands associated with shells , and identified in @xmath43-@xmath2 plots .",
    "furthermore , ngc 604 presents a well defined lower limit ( @xmath44 @xmath45 17 ) in supersonic line width everywhere ( horizontal band in @xmath43-@xmath2 plot ) , while ngc 588 does not .",
    "a substantial fraction of ngc 588 presents line widths lower than the brightest region , including points showing subsonic @xmath2 values .",
    "@xcite suggest that it is also the case for 30 dor . in the cometary stirring model ( csm )",
    "framework , this difference can also be understood as an evolutionary effect .",
    "a young region keeps most of the supersonic motions communicated to the leftover gas via bow shocks by the winds of low - mass stars during its early stage . as massive stars evolve , ejecting mechanical energy into the ism , through stellar winds and supernova events , they produce shells that expand beyond the core .",
    "shells will be destroyed by random motions of the background neighboring gas and slow down , resulting in @xmath2 even below the bright region @xcite . the main point in this scenario",
    "is that the dominant line - broadening mechanism in young ghiirs is gravity , while tuburlence by wind - driven shells and supernovae dominate in older ones .",
    "more recently , @xcite have shown that the morphological features observed in their analysis of three - dimensional spectroscopic data of three blue compact galaxies ( mrk 324 , mrk 370 , and iii zw 102 ) , especially those in the @xmath2 @xmath1 @xmath56 diagram , look similar to the ones found in ghiirs , with a supersonic horizontal band that extends over a large range of intensities , and inclined bands that reach high @xmath2 values at low intensity arising from large volumes surrounding the central knots . in a similar study to our own , using similar technique with gemini gmos / ifu , @xcite looked at the properties of a young star cluster and its environment in the dwarf irregular starburst galaxy ngc 1569 . despite the fact that they decompose the profiles rather than",
    "fit a single gaussian , the narrow components of their profiles show all properties found in these other studies including ours , namely that , it is most likely explained by a convolution of the stirring effects of massive star evolution and gravitational motions .",
    "in addition , they found that the observed lower limit ( @xmath44 @xmath45 12 km s@xmath5 ) of the narrow component is in agreement with @xmath57 .    here",
    ", we wish to test the hypothesis that the dominant broadening mechanism of the h@xmath0 line in the core of ii zw 40 is gravity .",
    "as shown in figure  [ int_sig ] ( left panel ) , ii zw 40 presents the lowest @xmath2 values ( @xmath2 @xmath4 20 km s@xmath5 ) in regions with faint h@xmath0 emission .",
    "here we identify region 6 as the most significant contributor to this low @xmath2 ( see figure  [ regions ] box 6b ) , which appears to present dominantly random motions , through its diagnostic diagrams .",
    "in addition , region 6 does not seem to be affected by the neighboring superbubble of region 5 .",
    "therefore , this region may still retain the kinematic information of the pre - existing underlying turbulent velocity field .",
    "the velocity dispersion values derived in region 6 should not be associated with the internal velocity dispersion of individual dense molecular cloud cores or clumps ( typically less than a few ) , where individual or groups of massive stars form , but instead , they may be the result of the large scale turbulent motions of the parent complex of diffuse molecular clouds , which gave rise to the present episode of violent star formation .",
    "some of these clouds will form stars in short local dynamical times , while others , though dense , may not form stars .",
    "we do not intend to discuss any detailed model , but simply try to envisage a viable scenario for our conjecture of an overall underlying velocity component .",
    "massive star clusters will form in much denser fragments ( clumps or cores ) of the molecular clouds whose properties are not assessed by our observations , and require density tracers ( e.g. hcn ) with high spatial resolution radio observations .",
    "though , these clumps must also have relative velocities stirring up the ism under the influence of the common gravitational potential due to the complex of stars , and gas , and possibly dark matter . the @xmath58co",
    "( j= 1 @xmath59 0 ) traces the diffuse molecular cloud on hundreds of parsec scales .",

    "however , these motions seem to be completely detached from the global hi velocity distribution which extends up to 5 arcmin ( @xmath4 6 kpc ) in the direction of the southern and northern tails @xcite , where the line width is w@xmath61 120 km s@xmath5 ( @xmath62 50 km s@xmath5 ) and has a strong contribution by the large scale rotation pattern of the galaxy on these scales .",
    "the large resolved supperbubble in region 5 is very well delimited in @xmath2 and intensity maps and may not have slowed down sufficiently to be disrupted .",
    "moreover , region 3 also presents a well defined bubble in @xmath2 and intensity maps , which is seen as an inclined band in the diagnostic plot . despite being smaller than the bubble in region 5 ,",
    "they both show similar profile shapes , expansion velocities @xmath51 @xmath4 45 , and integrated velocity dispersions @xmath2 @xmath4 45 , possibly indicating similar evolutionary phase and associated with the age of knot b.    although ii zw 40 contrasts slightly with a simple scenario for a ghiir , in the sense that it may suffer from the composite effects resulting from the evolution of multiple stellar clusters , we can say that in the csm context , the ghiir in ii zw 40 is kinematically young .",
    "some superbubbles are evolving within the core , though it does not present a constant @xmath2 or only `` well - behaved '' gaussian emission lines @xcite .",
    "however , the presence of surrounding regions showing lower @xmath2 than the core in ii zw 40 is a sign of youth .",
    "there are still unperturbed regions preserving kinematic information of the parent cloud under the dominant influence of the galaxy s gravitational potential , ionized by diffuse uv radiation . in consonance with our conclusions ,",
    "many studies about this galaxy indicate the presence of a very young starburst in its brightest region , as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "an important resolution bias must be of concern here in order to test our hypothesis .",
    "@xcite show that the supersonic integrated line profile in 30 dor is actually due to a superposition of discrete number of clouds , small shells and filaments which are resolved on subparsec scales . in these scales ,",
    "strong winds of wr , o and b stars might be responsible for stirring up the gas around the dominant young cluster , imposing a turbulent motion higher than the one predicted only by the gravitational potential",
    ". the presence of a significant number of the very young stars in the core should be responsible partially for the difference between the @xmath2 found in region 1 and that one found in region 6 .",
    "in fact , we found evidence of a broad component @xmath55 @xmath4 73 km s@xmath5 in region 1 , responsible for the large wings in the integrated profile , which may be associated with unresolved inner shells . however , its contribution to the integrated profile is very small , since only 18% of the total h@xmath0 flux in region 1 comes from this component .",
    "we can now sum up the main reasoning so far .",
    "a common framework assumes that the observed velocity dispersion ( @xmath63 ) is mainly given by the contributions of gravity ( @xmath6 ) , thermal broadening ( @xmath38 ) , multiple unresolved expanding shells ( @xmath47 ) and systematic radial motions ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "here we consider @xmath46 as being the sum of several phenomena such as sn , expanding bubbles , champagne flows , relative motions between discrete clusters providing large scale shear , turbulence and rotation , which cause position - to - position radial velocity variations and , in extreme cases , line splitting .",
    "we detected and identified @xmath47 only in the core , i.e. region 1 , as the weak broad component , but possibly present with different weights in the whole nebula .",
    "indeed , we found that most profiles have peaked shape indicating the presence of faint wings or broad components , with the exception of those found in regions of bubbles , i.e. region 3 and 5 .",
    "once corrected for the instrumental profile , the observed velocity dispersion of a ghiir or discrete regions inside them is therefore given by    @xmath64 @xcite .",
    "we fixed the thermal broadening as @xmath38 = 9.1 km s@xmath5 due to the gas electron temperature for hydrogen at 10@xmath36k , causing no significant systematic error in our results .",
    "the radial velocity variations on scales larger than 50 pc can be identified here .",
    "it varies from few km s@xmath5 in regions such region 1 , @xmath46 @xmath4 6.5 km s@xmath5 , to @xmath46 @xmath4 38 km s@xmath5 in regions 3 and 5 as inferred from line splitting in the center of bubbles .",
    "region 6 seems to be `` free from shells '' , and it can be a good probe of @xmath6 @xmath4 20 - 25 km s@xmath5 , posing a lower limit of velocity dispersion in ii zw 40 .",
    "in fact , these values are not very different from the narrow component found in region 1 , @xmath54 @xmath4 29 km s@xmath5 , and the lower limit @xmath44 @xmath4 25 km s@xmath5 in the @xmath65 diagnostic diagram . if indeed , the @xmath2 measured in region 6 , is unaffected by stellar evolution , and the narrow component of the gaussian fit to the profile of region 1 gives the same low value of @xmath2 , and additionally the low limit of overall measured @xmath2 is probing the same physical mechanism , we may suggest a common dominant line broadening cause .",
    "gravity provides the continuous underlying source of stirring the ism over the whole star - forming region .",
    "however , the characteristic @xmath2 = 32 - 35 km s@xmath5 found over the whole starburst region of ii zw 40 and derived from a single gaussian fit should be the result of combined sources , of the dominant action of gravity , unresolved multiple expanding shells and systematic radial motions .",

    "the broad component should be associated with @xmath47 originated from multiple unresolved shells provided by stellar winds of wr and ob stars acting on few or subparsec scales .    the kinematic features in ii zw 40 are all remarkably similar to the ones found in supersonic ghiirs in irregular and other star forming galaxies powered by massive star and stellar cluster formation and evolution , suggesting that these starbursts in hii galaxies are their scaled up versions on galactic scales .    finally , the core supersonic @xmath2 is the one producing the luminosity-@xmath2 relation observed in ghiirs and hiigs .",
    "this component can be derived by simply measuring the integrated line profiles by fitting a single gaussian on the brightest knot of the starburst , regardless of aperture size .",
    "however , we must further investigate how these derived motions precisely relate to the underlying mass distribution before we can derive absolute total galactic masses .",
    "we must also investigate , with a statistically significant sample , the possible evolutionary effects of the starburst on the observed relations , and how they can be parametrized for the use as a powerful extragalactic distance estimator applied to high redshifts .",

    "it is convenient to emphasize the meaning of some patterns formed by the point distributions in the different diagnostic diagrams of figure  [ int_sig ] .",
    "these patterns are the graphical representation of the kinematic signatures observed in the 2d flux , velocity and dispersion maps .",
    "the following description is valid for the methodology of fitting only single gaussians to the emission line profiles and its limitation is emphasized when necessary .",
    "however , it is a very powerful tool for kinematic analysis provided by data cubes .",
    "three typical patterns are of particular interest , and they are sketched in diagrams ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) of figure  [ schem ] .    figure  [ schem]a shows the pattern known as the inclined band in the @xmath43-@xmath2 diagram , previously identified by @xcite .",
    "the authors propose that this pattern should be the result of an ideal shell evolving in the ism .",
    "their scenario allows the interpretation of this diagram as a diagnosis for the evolutionary state of the ghiirs .",
    "the points defining the vertexes of the triangle should correspond to the three parts of the shell : center , inner edge and outer edge ( see their fig .",
    "the velocity dispersion in the center reaches the maximum value , while the minimum value occurs in the outer edge .",
    "the inner edge presents higher intensity and higher velocity dispersion than the outer edge .",
    "assuming that the pattern drawn in the figure  [ schem]a represents a young shell , as it ages , @xmath2 at the center becomes gradually lower , as well as the difference between the intensity at the center and at the inner edge .",
    "then , the whole figure shifts down , and the upper angle becomes smaller .",
    "furthermore , in their scenario , older shells should present higher intensities than young ones , and should be mapped at right of the young ones in the diagram .",
    "figure  [ schem]b shows a vertical band pattern in @xmath43-@xmath3 diagram .",
    "this pattern indicates the contribution of resolved systematic radial movements .",
    "abrupt velocity variations in a short intensity range should indicate a local expansion of the gas .",
    "it is expected that regions which present the inclined band pattern in the @xmath43-@xmath2 diagram also present a well defined vertical band pattern in @xmath43-@xmath3 diagram . in general , any vertical variations ( @xmath50 )",
    "can be used to quantify the component due to expanding motions in a region .",
    "we used the approximation fwhm@xmath68 @xmath50 to infer the broadening component due to radial velocity variations ( @xmath46 ) for regions with almost constant @xmath2 values and nearly gaussian emission line profiles .",
    "however , if the emission profiles are not well represented by single gaussians , @xmath50 measured in @xmath43-@xmath3 plot should underestimate the real component due to systematic radial expansion . as an alternative",
    ", one might try to measure the line splitting from the most asymmetric or double peaked profile , in order to better estimate @xmath50 from two centroids .",
    "figure  [ schem]c shows a correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "this pattern indicates systematic motion with a significant component in the line of sight .",
    "the pattern drawn indicates differentiated group behavior : in this case , gas with relatively high @xmath2 is moving away from the observer .",
    "although we have drawn the pattern with a positive slope , a region with the same systematic motions could be identified in a negative slope pattern .",
    "such dependence should be expected in the presence of relative motions between distinct clouds of ionized gas with different internal properties .",
    "champagne flows should reproduce the pattern like the one shown in figure  [ schem]c ( see @xmath69 iii__c _ _ in @xcite ) . the simplest pattern would be the random distribution of the points in the plane @xmath3-@xmath2 , indicating no dependence between the variables . in this latter case , it may represent isotropic expansion or turbulence , but with no privileged direction ."
