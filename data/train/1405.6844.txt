    "there is an increasing interest in materials whose fermi surface is not extended , as it is usually the case , but it consists of disconnected points . in several of such materials",
    "the charge carriers admit at low energies an effective description in terms of dirac massless particles .",
    "this opens the exiting possibility that high energy phenomena have a counterpart at low energies in real materials .",
    "_ graphene _ is probably the most known example of such systems ; it was pointed out in @xcite,@xcite that fermions on the honeycomb lattice behave as massless dirac fermions in @xmath0 dimensions and indeed the experimental realization of graphene @xcite , a monolayer sheet of graphite , offered a spectacular physical realization of such a system .    as a next step ,",
    "it is natural to look for materials with electronic bands touching in couples of points and with an emerging description in terms of @xmath1 massless dirac ( or weyl ) particles , the same appearing in the standard model to describe quarks and leptons .",
    "such systems have been called _ weyl semimetals _ , and their existence has been predicted in several systems @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite ; this has generated an intense experimental research , see for instance @xcite , @xcite ( and the review @xcite ) .",
    "it is of course important to understand the effect of the interactions , which are usually analyzed in effective relativistic models neglecting lattice effects @xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite .",
    "perturbative considerations suggest that short range interactions can generate instabilities only at strong coupling , but in order to exclude non perturbative effects one has to prove the convergence of the expansions .",
    "it is also known that in such class of systems the effective relativistic description misses important features ; for instance in the case of graphene the universality of the optical conductivity emerges only taking into account the lattice @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider a three dimensional interacting fermionic _",
    "lattice _ model with a point - like fermi surface @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , in presence of an hubbard interaction .",
    "we construct the zero temperature correlations for couplings not too large , proving the persistence of the weyl semimetallic phase in presence of interactions . in the non interacting case the semimetallic phase , in which the elementary excitations are well described in terms of weyl fermions , is present in an extended region of the parameters ; outside such a region an insulating behavior is present and a quantum critical point discriminates between the two phases . in the semimetallic phase the fermi surface consists of two points ; close to the critical point the two points are very close and the fermi velocity is arbitrarily small ( and vanishes at the boundary )",
    "the effective relativistic description coincides with a system of massless dirac fermions in @xmath1 dimensions with an ultraviolet cut - off like the gross - neveu model or qed with massive photon : in such models the interaction is irrelevant and the convergence of the renormalized perturbative expansion has been established , see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however the convergence radius in such models is _ vanishing _ with the particle velocity ; therefore such results give essentially no information for lattice weyl semimetals close to the boundary of the semimetallic phase where the fermi velocity is very small .",
    "one may suspect that even an extremely weak interaction could produce some quantum instability close to the boundary of the semimetallic phase , where the parameters correspond to a strong coupling regime in the effective description .",
    "this is however excluded by the present paper : we can prove the persistence of the weyl semimetallic phase in presence of interaction in all the semimetallic region , even arbitrarily close to the boundary where the fermi velocity vanishes .",
    "this result is achieved writing the correlations in terms of a renormalized expansion with a radius of convergence which is independent from the fermi velocity , and in order to get this one needs to exploit the non linear corrections to the dispersion relation due to the lattice .",
    "the proof is indeed based on two different multiscale analysis in two regions of the energy momentum space ; in the smaller energy region the effective relativistic description is valid while in the larger energy region the quadratic corrections due to the lattice are dominating . in both regimes",
    "the interaction is irrelevant but the scaling dimensions are different ; after the integration of the first regime one gets gain factors which compensate exactly the velocities at the denominator produced in the second regime , so that uniformity is achieved .",
    "such a phenomenon is completely absent in graphene , in which the the fermi velocity is essentially constant .",
    "another important phenomenon present here ( and absent either in graphene and in the effective relativistic description ) is the movement of weyl points due to the interaction .",
    "the analysis is based on the _ renormalization group _ ( rg ) method of _ wilson _ and its approach to the effective action @xcite , in the form implemented in @xcite and @xcite in the context of perturbative renormalization .",
    "it was realized in the eighties that such methods can be indeed used to get a full _ non - perturbative _ control of certain fermionic quantum field theories in @xmath2 , @xcite , @xcite using gram bounds and brydges formula for truncated expectation @xcite .",
    "a very natural development was then to apply such techniques to condensed matter models , @xcite,@xcite with the final aim at obtaining a full non perturbative control of the ground state properties of interacting systems .",
    "however , while the interaction in the models considered in @xcite or @xcite is marginally irrelevant or dimensionally irrelevant , this is not the case in interacting non relativistic fermionic models in one dimension , or in dimensions greater than one with extended fermi surface .",
    "this is due to the fact that the ground state properties of the interacting system are generically different with respect to the non interacting case . in one dimension",
    "it was finally obtained a full control of the zero temperature properties of interacting fermions , in the spinless @xcite,@xcite or repulsive spinning case @xcite ; this was achieved by combining rg methods with ward identities based on the emerging chiral symmetries . in systems in higher dimensions with extended symmetric fermi surface , rigorous results were obtained , see @xcite , @xcite , for temperatures _ above _ an exponentially small scale setting the onset of ( possible ) quantum instabilities . only in the case of an _ asymmetric _",

    "the interaction is irrelevant and this allows the proof of the convergence of the renormalized expansion up to zero temperature , as in the case of graphene @xcite or the case discussed in the present paper . in the case of graphene",
    ", the combination of non perturbative bounds with lattice ward identities allows to establish remarkable physical conclusions , like the universality of the optical conductivity @xcite .",

    "there is a _ quantum critical point _ @xmath73 discriminating the metallic and the insulating region .",
    "we ask now the question if weyl semimetallic behavior , present under the conditions and , survives to the presence of the interaction .",

    "the starting point is a functional integral representation of the schwinger functions which is quite suitable for such methods .",
    "we want to establish the persistence of weyl semimetallic behavior with weyl points given by .",

    "therefore it is convenient to proceed in two steps .",
    "the first consists in writing @xmath75 and in proving that one can choose @xmath76 so that there is weyl semimetallic behavior under the condition @xmath77 , and that in such region the weyl points are given by @xmath78 with @xmath79 ; in this way the location of the singularity of the two point function does not move , and this is technically convenient as we construct the interacting function as series starting from the non interacting one .",
    "once that this is ( possibly ) done the second step consists in solving the inversion problem @xmath80 , so that one can determine the location of the weyl points as function of the initial parameters .",
    "we will deal here with the first step only , which is the substantial one ; the inversion problem can be done via standard methods once the first step is done , see for instance lemma 2.8 of @xcite for a similar problem .",
    "we will introduce a set of _ grassmann variables _ @xmath81 , @xmath82 by the same symbol as the fermionic fields .",

    "therefore the equality is trivial except in the graphs containing a _ tadpole _ ,",

    "the above theorem establishes analyticity in @xmath120 for values of the parameters including either the semimetallic and the insulating phase , and proves for the first time the existence of a weyl semimetallic phase in an interacting system with short range interactions .",
    "the effect of the interaction is to generically modify the location of the weyl points ( the counterterm @xmath119 takes this into account ) and to change the parameters of the emerging relativistic description , like the wave function renormalization and the `` light '' velocity .",
    "2 .   note that close to the boundary of the semimetallic phase the ( third component ) of the fermi velocity @xmath130 is small , and vanishes continuously at the _ quantum critical point _ @xmath73 discriminating between insulating and semimetallic phase .",

    "some universality properties of the optical conductivity in the semimetallic phase can be proved , see @xcite .",
