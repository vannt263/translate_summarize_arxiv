    "the study of the brownian motion of rigid particles suspended in a viscous solvent is one of the oldest subjects in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics since the pioneering work of einstein @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it was not until the seventies that it was realized how subtle diffusion in liquids is @xcite , and to this day there remain open fundamental questions about the collective diffusion in colloidal suspensions .",
    "for example , the validity of fick s macroscopic law is questioned for suspensions confined to a two dimensions @xcite , and it remains as a substantial mathematical challenge to prove that a local fickian equation is the law of large numbers in three dimensions , even for dilute suspensions @xcite .",
    "these questions are not of purely academic interest since diffusion is of crucial importance in a number of applications in chemical engineering and materials science , such as the study of the dynamics of passive or active @xcite particles in suspension , the dynamics of biomolecules in solution @xcite , the design of novel nanocolloidal suspensions @xcite , and others .",
    "the importance of coarse - graining to the study of diffusion in nanocolloidal suspensions is easy to appreciate ; the number of degrees of freedom necessary to simulate brownian motion directly using molecular dynamics ( md ) is large enough to make this approach prohibitively expensive . in this paper",
    ", we derive from `` first principles '' a coarse - grained dynamic equation for the position of a nanoparticle immersed in a simple fluid , fully taking into account hydrodynamic effects .",
    "the key source of difficulty in the theoretical and computational modeling of colloidal diffusion is the presence of viscous dissipation in the surrounding fluid .",
    "this hydrodynamic dissipation in the solvent induces long - ranged hydrodynamic fields that couple the motion of the solute particles to boundaries and to other particles .",
    "these effects are termed hydrodynamic interactions in the literature , but it should be kept in mind that these `` interactions '' are different in nature from direct interactions such as steric repulsion or long - ranged attractions among the colloids . the well - known smoluchowski or brownian dynamics ( bd ) @xcite approach captures the effect of the solvent through a mobility matrix that is approximated using hydrodynamic models based on assumptions that are of questionable validity for nanoscopic particles .",
    "in particular , a gold nanocolloid and a biomolecule such as a protein can only be distinguished in bd based on an effective hydrodynamic no - slip surface but not based on the nature of their interaction with the solvent .",
    "this makes bd unsuitable for capturing multiscale effects such as slip on the surface of the particle , layering of the solvent molecules around the colloid , transient hydrogen bond networks around the protein , etc .",
    "the fluctuation - dissipation balance principle informs us that viscous dissipation is intimately related to fluctuations of the fluid velocity .",
    "it is well - known that diffusion in liquids is strongly affected by advection by thermal velocity fluctuations @xcite , and that nonequilibrium diffusive mixing is accompanied by `` giant '' long - range correlated thermal fluctuations @xcite . as explained in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite , there is a direct relation between these unusual properties of thermal fluctuations in liquid solutions and brownian dynamics .",
    "specifically , a simplified model of colloidal diffusion based on _ incompressible fluctuating hydrodynamics _ can be mapped one - to - one to the equations of bd and related dynamic density functional theories ( ddft ) with hydrodynamics @xcite ; this derivation shows that hydrodynamic interactions are nothing more nor less than _ hydrodynamic correlations _ induced by the thermal fluctuations in the solvent .",
    "such a fluctuating hydrodynamic model @xcite explains the appearance of giant nonequilibrium fluctuations in the concentration of colloidal particles , justifies the stokes - einstein relation in the limit of large schmidt numbers @xcite , and describes the important influence of boundaries in confined suspensions @xcite . if one wants to further account for inertial effects and compressibility of the fluid , as crucial for modeling the effect of ultrasound on colloidal particles @xcite or the acoustic vibrations produced by suspended _ _",
    "particles @xcite _ _ or micro - organisms @xcite , one can use a similar model but describe the fluid using _ compressible _ fluctuating hydrodynamics @xcite .    in this work",
    "we consider coupling compressible isothermal fluctuating hydrodynamics to a suspended nanocolloidal particle .",
    "unlike previous phenomenological models @xcite , we obtain our equations from the underlying microscopic dynamics by using the theory of coarse - graining ( tcg ) as developed by green @xcite and zwanzig @xcite ( also see the textbook @xcite ) , together with a sequence of careful approximations that preserve the correct structure of the exact ( but formal ) coarse - grained equations .",
    "our derivation is important for several reasons .",
    "firstly , our work provides a microscopic foundation for the types of models used in existing theoretical and computational work @xcite .",
    "secondly , and more importantly , our derivation leads to microscopic green - kubo type formulas for the transport coefficients that appear in the coarse - grained equations .",
    "this allows for these coefficients to be estimated from molecular dynamics computations , thus fully taking into account microscopic effects that are difficult if not impossible to include in purely continuum models .",
    "thirdly , our derivation will lead us to first construct a microscopically - justified fully discrete form of compressible isothermal fluctuating hydrodynamics that is second - order accurate while also maintaining discrete fluctuation - dissipation balance to second order .",
    "this last contribution is in itself a significant extension of prior work @xcite , fully consistent with the approach to nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics proposed in our recent work @xcite .",
    "specifically , the coarse - grained equations we derive here by following a `` bottom - up '' approach can also be derived by a `` top - down '' approach in which one starts from a ( phenomenological ) system of formal stochastic partial differential equations and applies a petrov - galerkin finite - element discretization @xcite .",
    "our work therefore provides a direct and _ explicit _ link between the microscopic discrete dynamics and mesoscopic continuum fluctuating hydrodynamics . the physical insight that is necessary to construct phenomenological fluctuating hydrodynamics equations translates in this paper into physical insight required when constructing suitable approximations or closures of a number of intractable microscopic expressions .",
    "the `` bottom - up '' procedure clearly reveals all of the required terms in the coarse - grained equations and provides microscopic expressions for the required coefficients .    at first sight",
    ", it may seem like the equations of smoluchowski that underlie brownian dynamics have a well - known microscopic derivation . indeed , it is not difficult to construct a text - book tcg for the dynamic equation describing the positions of the colloidal particles @xcite .",
    "this leads to the well - known expression for the hydrodynamic mobility ( diffusion tensor ) as the time integral of the correlation function of the velocities of the solute particles , conditional on the particle s positions .",
    "it should , however , quickly be recognized that this well - known expression , while correct , is not useful in practice , for several reasons .",
    "firstly , this integral must be computed anew for _ every _ configuration of the suspended particles . secondly , even if one could run a new md calculation at every step in a bd simulation , it is important to realize that these md computations are _ unfeasible _ in practice because they must be very long on microscopic scales .",
    "namely , it is well - known that the slow viscous ( diffusive ) dissipation of momentum in the fluid makes the velocity correlation functions have long ( power - law ) hydrodynamic tails ; it is the integral of these tails that gives the hydrodynamic correlations ( interactions ) among the particles , as well as finite - size effects on the diffusion coefficient for confined particles @xcite .",
    "therefore , to correctly capture hydrodynamic effects the time integral in the green - kubo expression for the diffusion tensor must extend to at least the time it takes for momentum to diffuse throughout the _ whole _ system ; while this time is typically short compared to the time scale at which the solute particles move , it is very long based on md standards .",
    "by contrast , in the equations derived here the green - kubo integrals can be computed via _ feasible _ ( short ) md simulations .",
    "this is because all of the hydrodynamics , such as the effects of sound @xcite or viscous dissipation @xcite are captured by explicitly resolving the ( fluctuating ) hydrodynamics of the solvent using a grid of hydrodynamic cells , and only the remaining _ local _ and _ short - time _ effects need to be captured by the microscopic simulations . in the present work ,",
    "we consider suspensions that are sufficiently dilute to allow us to neglect the direct ( as opposed to hydrodynamic ) interactions among the colloids and focus our derivation on a single particle immersed in a viscous liquid ; hydrodynamic interactions among the particles are still captured because they are mediated by the explicitly resolved surrounding fluid dynamics . in fact , we believe that in many cases of interest the coarse - grained diffusive dynamics can effectively be simulated by _ a priori _ performing a small number of short md simulations of a single particle in a small ( say periodic ) domain .",
    "crucial to the above is the fact that in the present work the hydrodynamic cells are assumed to be significantly larger than the nanoparticle itself .    in the next section",
    "we explain in more detail the basic assumptions and thus limitations of our model .",
    "briefly , our model assumes that the solvent is a simple isotropic single - component fluid .",
    "we do not explicitly consider energy transport and thus limit our work to isothermal suspensions .",
    "we only consider dilute suspensions of nano particles .",
    "the extension to denser suspension leads to a significantly more complicated theory of liquid mixtures that is well beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the limitation to nanoscopic particles is not essential and the equations developed here can be used also for larger particles such as micron - sized colloids ; however , in this case the md simulations required to obtain the values of the green - kubo integrals that appear in the coarse - grained equations would again become unfeasible and a different approach is advised .",
    "we will also assume that the particle is effectively spherical so that describing the position of its center of mass is sufficient without requiring us to also resolve its orientation .",
    "our theory assumes a separation of time scales between the positions of the particles and their velocities , and we do not include the velocities of the colloidal particles in the description .",
    "more precisely , it requires that the schmidt number of the solute particles be very large .",
    "this is not a significant limitation in practice since the schmidt number of even a single solvent molecule is typically very large in liquids . in particular",
    ", our theory can be used to describe collective diffusion of tagged solvent particles ( i.e. , self - diffusion ) .    in section [ sec : cg ]",
    "we explain the basic notation and concepts , and carefully select and define the coarse - grained ( slow ) variables in terms of the microscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "we then proceed to carefully examine the reversible ( non - dissipative ) part of the dynamics . in particular , in section [ sec : exact ] we give exact results that are not useful on their own right since they lead to equations that are not closed explicitly . however , by making a series of approximations based on a key `` linear for spiky '' approximation we are able to derive an approximate closure for the reversible dynamics in section [ sec : linspiky ] . in section [ sec : irrev ]",
    "we apply the same approximation to the irreversible ( dissipative ) part of the dynamics , together with another important approximation in which we replace constrained green - kubo expressions with unconstrained equilibrium green - kubo averages .",
    "the key results of our calculations are then collected and discussed in section [ sec : finalresults ] .",
    "we first give an approximate but _ closed _ form for the coarse - grained _ discrete _ dynamics , and then discuss the relation of these discrete equations to continuum models in section [ sec : continuum ] .",
    "a comparison of our results to phenomenological models and a discussion of their significance and range of validity is given in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "a number of technical calculations are detailed in an extensive appendix .",
    "in this section , we give the basic ingredients required to perform the coarse - graining of the microscopic dynamics for our specific system .",
    "we begin with a general overview of the theory and then specialize to the case of a nanoparticle suspended in a simple liquid by explaining the details of the microscopic dynamics and the definition of the coarse - grained variables .      in this section ,",
    "we review the theory of coarse - graining or non - equilibrium statistical mechanics as established by green @xcite and zwanzig @xcite .",
    "the theory allows to construct the dynamic equations for the probability distribution of a set of coarse - grained ( cg ) variables that describe the state of a system at a coarse _ level of description_. the theory states that , under the assumption that the cg variables are sufficiently slow as compared with the eliminated degrees of freedom , the system follows a diffusion process in the space of cg variables .",
    "the resulting dynamic equation for the probability distribution of the cg variables is given by a fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) , where both the drift and diffusion terms are given in microscopic terms .",
    "the coarse - grained variables are selected functions @xmath0 in phase space , i.e. they depend on the set of position and momenta @xmath1 of the molecules of the system .",
    "we follow the convention that a hatted symbol like @xmath0 denotes a function in phase space that may take numerical values @xmath2 .",
    "the selection of the relevant variables @xmath3 is a crucial step in the description of a non - equilibrium system .",
    "a crucial requirement is that they are _ slow _",
    "variables @xcite . when this is the case , the probability distribution of a set of relevant variables @xmath2 obeys the fpe @xmath4p(x , t ) \\right\\ } \\nonumber\\\\ & + k_bt\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\!\\cdot\\ ! \\left\\{{\\cal d}(x)\\!\\cdot\\ !",
    "\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial { x } } p(x , t ) \\right\\ } \\label{zfpe}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the different objects in this equation have a well - defined microscopic definition . for example , the _ reversible drift _ is @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the liouville operator and the conditional expectation is defined by @xmath7 where @xmath8 stands for the microscopic equilibrium distribution and @xmath9 is actually a product of dirac delta functions , one for every function @xmath10 .",
    "the equilibrium distribution of the relevant variables is @xmath11 and is closely related to the _ bare free energy _ of the level of description @xmath2 which is defined through @xmath12 here @xmath13 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath14 the temperature of the equilibrium state .",
    "we will refer in this work to the bare free energy also as the coarse - grained hamiltonian because of the particular form that @xmath15 acquires at the hydrodynamic level of description .",
    "when non - isothermal situations are considered one rather introduces the entropy of the level of description as @xmath16 , according to einstein formula for fluctuations .    finally , the symmetric and positive semidefinite @xcite _ dissipative matrix _",
    "@xmath17 is the matrix of transport coefficients expressed in the form of green - kubo formulas , @xmath18 the term @xmath19 is the so called _ projected current_. the projection operator @xmath20 is defined from its action on any phase function @xmath21 @xcite @xmath22 the dynamic operator @xmath23 is usually named the projected dynamics , which is , strictly speaking different from the real hamiltonian dynamics @xmath24 .",
    "the projected dynamics can be usually approximated by the real dynamics but , in order to avoid the so called _ plateau problem _ @xcite , then the upper infinite limit of integration in eq .",
    "( [ m ] ) has to be replaced by @xmath25 , a time which is long in front of the correlation time of the integrand , but short in front of the time scale of evolution of the macroscopic variables @xcite , this is @xmath26 in general , it is expected that different elements of the matrix may require different values of @xmath25 .",
    "the ito stochastic differential equation ( sde ) that is mathematically equivalent to the fpe ( [ zfpe ] ) is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a linear combination of white noises , formally time derivatives of a collection of independent wiener processes ( brownian motions ) @xmath29 , where the amplitudes satisfy the fluctuation - dissipation balance ( fdb ) condition @xmath30 in summary , the three basic objects that determine the dynamics ( either in the fpe ( [ zfpe ] ) or the sde ( [ sde ] ) forms ) and that need to be computed in the theory are the bare free energy @xmath31 , the reversible drift @xmath32 , and the dissipative matrix @xmath33 .    the reversible drift can also be written in the form @xcite @xmath34 where the skew - symmetric reversible matrix is defined as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the poisson bracket . here and in",
    "what follows , einstein convention that sums over repeated indices is assumed .",
    "note that the form of the drift ( [ driftl ] ) ensures automatically the gibbs - boltzmann distribution @xmath37 is the equilibrium solution of ( [ zfpe ] ) , _ even for approximate forms _ of the reversible matrix @xmath38 and the cg hamiltonian @xmath15 , and , thus , is the preferred form for the reversible drift in the present work .",
    "the most important step in the tcg is the selection of the _ relevant _ ( coarse - grained ) _",
    "variables_. this selection must be guided by physical intuition and the presence or absence of separation of time scales .",
    "the key guiding principle is that the relevant variables must evolve much more slowly than _ all _ other variables that can not be expressed entirely in terms of the relevant variables .",
    "this allows us to make a markovian approximation of the coarse - grained dynamics , which takes the form of a fokker - planck equation for the probability distribution of relevant variables , or equivalently , of a stochastic differential equation for the instantaneous ( fluctuating ) relevant variables .",
    "ultimately , one is often only interested in the positions ( and possibly orientations ) of the colloidal particles , eliminating the solvent from consideration entirely .",
    "this is possible to do via tcg because indeed in liquids mass diffusion is very slow compared to momentum and heat diffusion , and thus the positions of the particles are much slower than the hydrodynamic fields . indeed , following the tcg using only the positions of the particles",
    "leads to the well known equations of smoluchowski or brownian dynamics , with well - known green - kubo expressions for the hydrodynamic mobility ( equivalently , diffusion ) matrix ( see , for example , section v in @xcite ) . as we explained above",
    ", this level of description is not sufficiently detailed to allow us to describe a number of important microscopic effects that occur in the vicinity of the particle surface .",
    "while in the present work we do not capture explicitly the slip at the surface and the layering effects around a nanoparticle , we do take into account such effects implicitly through the microscopic expressions that enter in the theory .",
    "furthermore , the green - kubo formulas for the mobility are not useful in practice and one must close the equations by using a pairwise approximation to the mobility matrix based on far - field expansions for stokes flow .    to go to a more fundamental ( microscopically more informed ) level of description we must include solvent degrees of freedom as well .",
    "we want to describe the solvent molecules at the hydrodynamic rather than the microscopic level since it is not reasonable to keep track of the positions and momenta of every molecule in the system . at macroscopic scales ,",
    "a fluid appears as a continuum that is described with smooth fields obeying the well - known navier - stokes equations .",
    "the `` field '' concept is tricky , though , because a field is a mathematical object that has infinitely many degrees of freedom , while the actual fluid system has a finite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "of course , the fields are defined above a certain spatial resolution much larger than the typical size and distances between molecules of the fluid . at these",
    "macroscopic scales the field at one point of space effectively represents a very large number of molecules that move in a coherent manner .",
    "when one descends down to mesoscopic scales , molecules do not move that coherently , and one starts appreciating the discrete nature of the fluid .",
    "in other words , the average behavior and the actual behavior of the fluid molecules start to differ , and it is necessary to describe a fluid system with hydrodynamic equations that are intrinsically stochastic . the first phenomenological theory for such fluctuating hydrodynamics",
    "was proposed by landau and lifshitz , who introduced the concepts of random stress and heat fluxes , to be added to the usual newtonian stress and fourier heat flux @xcite .    from a mathematical point of view , the nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations ( spdes ) of fluctuating hydrodynamics are ill - defined .",
    "in other words , a continuum limit of sequences of more refined otherwise reasonable discrete versions of the partial differential equation does not exist . from a physical point of view , though , this is not much of a problem because we know that the continuum limit can not be realized without first encountering the atomistic nature of matter . for these reasons , it is necessary to define _ discrete _ hydrodynamic variables by averaging over a number of nearby molecules , and use these discrete variables in the tcg . in this work ,",
    "following the approach developed in a sequence of prior works @xcite , we define discrete hydrodynamic fields by placing a fixed ( eulerian ) grid of hydrodynamic _ nodes _ and associating to each node a fluid density and momentum averaged over a hydrodynamic _ cell _ associated to that node . in the present work we compute with more rigor some of the conditional expectations that were plausibly approximated in @xcite . in order",
    "to have a reasonable hydrodynamics description we need to have hydrodynamic cells that contain many solvent molecules ; here we consider simple liquids for which hydrodynamic cells containing many molecules will also be much larger than the mean free path .    for a colloidal particle that is much larger than the solvent molecules ,",
    "the hydrodynamic flow around the nanoparticle can be resolved with small ( compared to the size of the nanoparticle ) hydrodynamic cells that , nevertheless , still contain many solvent molecules .",
    "in this situation , the discrete _ fluid mass _ density @xmath39 , and the discrete _ fluid _ momentum densities @xmath40 , where @xmath41 indexes the hydrodynamic nodes , would only include contributions from the solvent particles .",
    "at such a level of description it is necessary to include both the position @xmath42 _ and _ the momentum @xmath43 of the nanoparticle in the list of relevant variables because even though @xmath43 is much faster than the position , it evolves on the same time scale as the hydrodynamic momentum around the particle .",
    "this level of description has been traditionally used for the description of brownian motion of colloidal particles coupled with fluctuating hydrodynamics @xcite .",
    "we do not consider this case here ; for a phenomenological model of this type we refer the reader to refs .",
    "it is important to note that it is inconsistent to keep the velocities and thus inertial dynamics of the particles without also accounting for the viscosity and inertia of the surrounding fluid .",
    "this is because there is not a separation of time scales between the velocities of the particles and the velocity of the surrounding fluid ; the _ only _ consistent coarse - grained _ implicit - fluid _ level of description is that of brownian dynamics , as explained in detail by roux @xcite .",
    "here we consider a nanoparticle that is not much larger than the fluid molecules , so that the hydrodynamic cells are much larger than the nanocolloidal particle , i.e. , we have a `` subgrid '' colloidal particle . in particular , the `` nanoparticle '' particle could be just a tagged fluid molecule when modeling self - diffusion in a liquid .",
    "since the momentum of the particle evolves on the same time scale as the solvent molecules with which it collides , more precisely , since the fluctuations of the _ relative _ velocity of the colloid are fast compared to hydrodynamic time scales , we define the hydrodynamic mass and momentum density fields to _ include the nanoparticle contribution_. in summary , the level of description that we consider in this work is characterized by the position of the colloid @xmath44 , the ( total , i.e. , including the contribution from the nanoparticle ) discrete mass density @xmath39 , and the ( total ) discrete momentum density @xmath45 , where @xmath41 indexes the hydrodynamic nodes .",
    "we make use of the standard tcg of zwanzig where all the terms ( cg free energy , drift , and diffusion matrix ) are given in microscopic terms @xcite .",
    "this allows one to obtain the general structure of the dynamics .",
    "however in order to find tractable results it is crucial to make a number of assumptions .",
    "all the approximations that we consider rely on the fact that the cells used to define the hydrodynamic variables are much larger than the typical intermolecular distances in such a way that every cell contains many molecules of the fluid .",
    "in particular , we assume that the microscopic local density field which is of the form @xmath46 gives , once inside conditional expectations , the same result as the interpolated discrete density variables ( see eq .",
    "( [ approx0 ] ) below and fig .",
    "[ fig : lfsa ] ) .",
    "this is only plausible if , again , there are many molecules per cell and the values of the discrete variables in neighboring cells are very similar . while this is statement about the flow regimes for which the resulting equations apply , it is also an statement about the size of the fluctuation of the hydrodynamic variables .",
    "they need to be _ small _ , otherwise , the value in neighbor cells could be very different just by chance .",
    "in other words , the number of molecules per cell must be sufficiently large in order for the relative fluctuations to be sufficiently small . in the end",
    ", the validity of the approximations made and the utility of the final equations we obtain can only be judged by a computational comparison to the true microscopic dynamics ( molecular dynamics ) .      in the present work we consider a simple liquid system of @xmath47 particles described with the position and momenta of their center of mass ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : nano ] for a schematic representation ) , in a periodic box .",
    "we distinguish particle @xmath48 as the nanoparticle which has a mass @xmath49 , typically larger than the mass @xmath50 of a solvent particle . at the _ microscopic level",

    "the system is assumed to have periodic boundary conditions .    under the assumption that the hamiltonian is mixing , the dynamics will sample at long times the _ molecular ensemble _ @xcite given by @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the initial total momentum and energy of the system .",

    "the first step in the theory of coarse - graining is to specify the relevant variables in terms of the microscopic state @xmath1 of the system . in the present case",
    ", we choose as relevant variables the position of the nanoparticle @xmath70 and the mass and momentum hydrodynamic `` fields '' . as we will consider fluctuations in the hydrodynamic variables , the latter need to be defined in discrete terms @xcite .",
    "this is , we want to look at the mass and momentum of collections of molecules that are in a given region of space . to this end",
    ", we seed physical space with a set of @xmath71 _ nodes _ , located at the points @xmath72 .",
    "usually , the nodes are arranged in a regular lattice , but this is not necessary in what follows and arbitrary simplicial grids can be used ( see fig . [",
    "fig : nano ] for a schematic representation ) .",
    "we define the mass and momentum densities of the node @xmath41 according to @xmath73 where the index @xmath48 labels the nanoparticle .",
    "the basis function @xmath74 is a function ( with dimensions of inverse of a volume ) that is appreciably different from zero only in the vicinity of @xmath68 .",
    "this region is referred to as the hydrodynamic cell of node @xmath41 .",
    "we may regard the basis function @xmath75 as a `` discrete dirac delta function '' .",
    "its specific form is discussed below .",
    "note that both the mass and momentum densities contain the nanoparticle in their definition .",
    "it is convenient to introduce also the hydrodynamic fields of the solvent @xmath76 that do not contain in its definition the contribution of the nanoparticle ( i.e. the particle @xmath48 is excluded in the sum ) .",
    "we may express the discrete hydrodynamic variables ( [ cgvariables ] ) and ( [ rhogsol ] ) in terms of the usual microscopic densities @xmath77 as simple space integrals , @xmath78    note that the two sets of variables @xmath79 and @xmath80 are not expressible in terms of each other . while we have that the densities are related as @xmath81 there is no way to express the momentum @xmath82 as a function of @xmath83 .",
    "therefore , the dynamic equations to be obtained for each set of variables are _ essentially different _ and can not be obtained from each other through a simple change of variables . in other words ,",
    "the two sets of relevant variables lead to _ physically different _ descriptions .",
    "since the slowness of the hydrodynamic variables arises from the underlying conservation laws , and only the _ total _ mass and momentum fields are conserved quantities , the appropriate variables for the tcg are our chosen variables @xmath84 .      the actual form of the discrete dirac delta function @xmath85 needs to be specified .",
    "one possibility is to use the characteristic function ( divided by the volume of the cell ) of the voronoi cell of node @xmath41 . for @xmath86",
    "this will give the total mass ( per unit volume ) of the particles that happen to be within the voronoi cell @xmath41 . as we discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , though , this selection is unsuited for the derivation of the equations governing discrete hydrodynamics from the theory of coarse - graining .",
    "this is because the gradient of the characteristic function of the voronoi cell is singular and leads to ill - defined green - kubo expressions .",
    "it was suggested to instead use the delaunay triangulation associated with the set of nodes as a grid of finite elements ( fe ) , and take the discrete delta function to be the linear fe basis function @xmath87 associated with node @xmath41 , which has the characteristic shape of a tent in one dimension , a pyramid in two dimensions ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pyramid ] ) , and more generally a @xmath88-dimensional simplex in @xmath89 dimensions .     in two dimensions . ]",
    "note that the use of a voronoi / delaunay tessellation is not required , and any simplicial grid ( i.e. , a triangular grid in two dimensions or a tetrahedral grid in three dimensions ) whose vertices are the set of hydrodynamic nodes can be used equally well ( but for numerical purposes the grid should be kept as close to uniform as possible).1    in recent work @xcite , we have argued that an even better selection ( in terms of numerical accuracy ) is given by a basis function @xmath90 that is a linear combination of the ( dimensionless ) finite element linear basis functions functions @xmath91 @xmath92 the crucial requirement is that these basis functions are mutually orthogonal @xmath93 where we have introduced double bars to denote integration over space , this is @xmath94 for an arbitrary function @xmath95 .",
    "note that from ( [ deltapsi ] ) and ( [ orthogon ] ) it follows the explicit matrix form @xmath96 if we introduce the usual `` mass matrix '' of the finite element method @xmath97 the orthogonality condition implies that @xmath98 in ( [ deltapsi ] ) is given by the inverse of @xmath99 , this is @xmath100    the basis function @xmath90 may be regarded as a way of discretizing a field @xmath101 according to @xmath102 .",
    "the basis function @xmath87 permits to construct interpolated fields out of the discrete fields @xmath103 . the orthogonality condition ( [ orthogon ] )",
    "ensures that if we discretize an interpolated field , we recover the original discrete values , i.e. @xmath104 .",

    "by performing a systematic coarse - graining procedure based on the zwanzing projection operator , we have derived a system of stochastic _ ordinary _ differential equations ( [ sdefin ] ) describing the dynamics of a nano - sized particle immersed in a simple liquid .",
    "a key to the procedure was the use of a dual set of linear basis functions familiar from finite element methods ( fem ) as a way to coarse - grain the microscopic degrees of freedom .",
    "another key ingredient was the use of a `` linear for spiky '' weak approximation which replaces microscopic `` fields '' , i.e. , sums of delta functions centered at the fluid molecules , with a linear interpolant in the fem basis set .",

    ", we approximated the constrained green - kubo expressions for the dissipation coefficients with their equilibrium averages , and assumed a local form for the viscous dissipation suitable when the hydrodynamic cells contain a large number of fluid molecules .",

    "these equations are similar in structure to phenomenological equations used in a number of prior works @xcite , and therefore provide a justification for those types of models via the theory of coarse graining .",
    "this is not just an academic exercise , but one that also has some important practical utility .",
    "first , our derivation provides green - kubo expressions for transport coefficients , notably , for the _ bare _ diffusion coefficient which was phenomenologically added in @xcite as a way to account for under - resolved microscopic details that can not be captured with a hydrodynamic approach .",
    "our derivation also introduces novel terms that come from the microscopic interaction between the suspended particle and the liquid molecules ; these terms give additional modeling capability to account for more microscopic information in the coarse - grained description .",
    "another , perhaps unexpected , benefit of the microscopic derivation was that it lead directly to a discrete form of the divergence of the stochastic stress which obeys the fluctuation - dissipation balance relation . in more empirical approaches ,",
    "such a structure has to be either guessed , or constructed from suitable discrete stochastic fluxes and a pair of discrete divergence and gradient operators that are skew adjoints of one another @xcite .",
    "the coarse - graining procedure carried out here can be viewed as a _",
    "systematic _ derivation of the isothermal fns equations from molecular dynamics .",
    "formal derivations of these equations have been done before many times , see for example early work including non - linearities in @xcite , however , these derivations lead either to linearized equations or to _ ill - defined _ nonlinear spdes exhibiting an _ ultraviolet catastrophe_. as we argued in more detail in @xcite , the proper way to interpret such _ formal _ nonlinear spdes is to first _ discretize _ them by applying a systematic discretization procedure , for example , using a petrov - galerkin weak formulation .",
    "the justification for this prescription is the fact that here we obtain _ exactly _ the same set of discretized spdes by systematic coarse graining .",
    "this gives a direct _ link _ between the `` bottom - up '' approach of going from microscopic to mesoscopic equations , and the `` top - down '' approach in which one starts from continuum pdes and formally adds white - noise stochastic forcing and then applies a standard computational fluid dynamics ( cfd ) method to the resulting equations .",
    "renormalization techniques should be applied to the discrete equations rather than the continuum ones in order to systematically increase the coarse - graining scale from the mesoscopic to the macroscopic in order to recover a continuum limit , where predictions of physical quantities like space - time correlations do not depend on the lattice spacing @xmath327 as @xmath328 .",
    "the crucial link between the top - down and bottom - up approaches was already foreseen in @xcite , and then explicitly demonstrated on a significantly simpler microscopic model in the ph.d .",
    "thesis @xcite . at the same time , the new derivation given here significantly improves on the earlier derivation @xcite , which did not consider a suspended nanoparticle , in three key ways .",
    "firstly , here we account for the presence of a suspended particle .",
    "secondly , by using a dual set of basis functions , the resulting discretization is second - order rather than first - order accurate as the earlier derivation based on a single set of basis functions @xcite .",
    "thirdly , in the present work the discrete equations ( [ sdefin ] ) have a very precise relation to the continuum equations ( [ spde ] ) , rather than simply being reminiscent of _ some _ `` sensible '' discretization .",
    "we have given an _",
    "explicit _ prescription of how to connect the two worlds of md and cfd : use the same dual set of basis functions when coarse - graining as you do when discretizing .",
    "we believe this prescription can be applied to a variety of other problems , however , as this work shows , the bottom - up approach requires a lot more work to complete than the top - down approach .",
    "the continuum equations ( [ spde ] ) we proposed here bear a strong similarity , but also some crucial differences , with existing models . in order to explain the relation to prior work more clearly ,",
    "let us review a variety of existing models starting from more `` refined '' to more `` coarse . ''",
    "a more formal mathematical presentation of these levels of description is given by atzberger @xcite , here we give a physical summary .",
    "in many works an incompressible approximations is made in order to eliminate fast sound waves from the model @xcite .",
    "if one is interested only in the long - time diffusive dynamics the fluid inertia can also be eliminated by taking an overdamped limit @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the coupling between the nanocolloidal particle and the fluctuating fluid and not on the specifics of the fluid equations .    in a number of `` point particle '' _ frictional _ coupling approaches , as reviewed in detail in @xcite , the colloid s velocity is also included as a physical variable and a phenomenological `` friction '' force proportional to the velocity of the colloid relative to the local fluid velocity is added to an inertial particle equation . as we discussed in more detail in section [ sec : cgvars ] , such a level of description is not suitable under our assumption that the colloid is smaller than the typical size of the hydrodynamic cells . instead , we include the momentum of colloid in the _ total _ hydrodynamic momentum field .",
    "we note that , although not usually presented in this way , the same is actually true to a large extent for the model used in @xcite because what is called the mass of the colloid is actually the _ excess _ mass of the colloid over the expelled fluid @xcite .",
    "this is because the inertia of the expelled fluid is already included in the fns equations , which are assumed to apply everywhere including the volume occupied by the particle .",
    "therefore , part of the momentum of the particle is in fact included in the `` fluid momentum '' .",
    "for this reason , we find it difficult to imagine how one can justify the frictional point particle coupling model from a microscopic derivation .    in @xcite ,",
    "an _ instantaneous _",
    "inertial coupling is proposed in which the particle is forced to follow the local fluid velocity ; the main difference is that @xcite considers a compressible fluid , while @xcite focuses on the incompressible limit .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the instantaneous coupling @xcite can be derived as a limit of the frictional coupling when the friction coefficient becomes very large . in the language of the tcg ,",
    "the ( fast ) momentum of the particle is no longer included as a relevant variable , instead , just as in our description , a total momentum field is defined @xcite .",
    "this total momentum field follows an equation which has a similar structure to the momentum equation in ( [ spde ] ) , see for example eq .",
    "( 16 ) in @xcite in the incompressible limit .",
    "it is important to note that , even in the limit of an incompressible liquid , the density @xmath329 appearing in ( [ spde ] ) is _ not _ constant , rather , it includes the contribution from the colloid .",
    "therefore , for a dense particle ( e.g. , gold nanocolloid ) the discrete density will be larger at the nodes in the vicinity of the particle .",
    "this `` excess inertia '' is explicitly included in the model in refs .",
    "@xcite ( see for example the left - hand side of ( 13 ) in @xcite ) by `` spreading '' the excess inertia to the fluid grid . in the equations derived here",
    "the excess inertia is hidden in the definition of the coarse - grained density to include the contribution from the colloid , and the fact that the equation of state is only applied to the solvent part of the density @xmath330 .",
    "the terms in the particle equation related to the bare diffusion coefficient @xmath331 do not appear in either @xcite or @xcite ; these terms are suggested in appendix b.1 of @xcite but not included in numerical simulations .",
    "a bare diffusion coefficient is also introduced in the theoretical work @xcite but it is argued there that this term should somehow be small .",
    "interestingly , a renormalization of the diffusion coefficient similar in spirit to @xmath331 is present in the frictional coupling formulation @xcite and can be expressed in the einstein form @xmath332 , where @xmath333 is the phenomenological friction coefficient , see eq .",

    ", @xmath331 emerges naturally as does a green - kubo expression for it , giving it a precise microscopic interpretation .",
    "the fact our instantaneous coupling equations with bare diffusion can not be consistently derived from the frictional coupling formulation @xcite points to the lack of a microscopic foundation of that formulation , and justifies once again the advantage of systematic bottom - up approaches over phenomenological ones .    the stochastic thermal drift term @xmath338 in the momentum equation is ( wrongly ) missing in @xcite ; the term is also ( rightfully ) missing in the frictional coupling @xcite formulation .",
    "this term ought be there for instantaneous coupling , as explained in appendix b of @xcite based on fluctuation - dissipation balance arguments , and derived by taking the limit of infinite friction in the frictional coupling in @xcite .",
    "this osmotic pressure contribution from the particle , spread to the fluid via the regularized delta function , can be seen as coming from the eliminated fluctuations of the particle velocity around the local fluid velocity @xcite . in the inertial coupling formulation ,",
    "as explained in appendix b of @xcite and also in @xcite , this osmotic pressure is split into two pieces just like the particle momentum is split into two pieces , one piece attached to the fluid momentum and another excess piece .",
    "when the two pieces are added together one correctly recovers exactly the osmotic pressure term given in ( [ spde ] ) @xcite .",
    "the gradient of the solvent pressure appears in all phenomenological models , and seems very natural but it should be recognized that this is only an approximation .",
    "notably , the approximation consists in the assumption that this pressure is given by the equation of state of the fluid in the _ absence _ of the colloidal particle .",
    "this approximation is exact for a labeled or tagged particle of the fluid , i.e. , in case of self - diffusion .",
    "one can argue that the same should _ approximately _ hold for colloidal particles that have a similar structure to the fluid , notably , that have the same density and compressibility as the fluid .",

    "note that we have set here the excess mass of the particle @xcite over the fluid @xmath346 because in our notation @xmath329 includes the total mass of the particle ( see additional discussion in section [ sec : conclusions ] ) .    the similarities between our formulation and the formulation of balboa _ et al .",

    "our fully _ discrete _ formulation ( [ sdefin ] ) is completely new and is different in many crucial ways from existing discretizations .",
    "the first difference is that the discretization of the fns equations is based on a second - order conservative fem method , rather than the more commonly used finite - difference @xcite or finite - volume approach @xcite .",
    "a second difference is that in all prior models we are aware of , the regularized delta function is used to represent the particle itself , and its width is chosen to be on the order of the hydrodynamic radius of the particle .",

    "@xmath331 was treated as an adjustable parameter that is chosen so as to give a _ desired _ ( input ) effective @xmath247 , since @xmath377 follows from the discretization of the fluid equations and can not be adjusted independently .",
    "this is similar to how one can treat the fluid - particle interaction strength parameter @xmath187 as fitting parameters used to match the coarse - grained and particle dynamics as best as possible , instead of computing it from its ( approximate ! ) microscopic definition ( [ a_def ] ) .",
    "the work described here is purely theoretical and proposes a model with the correct structure but leaves a number of terms to be approximated and modeled . as such",
    ", the usefulness and accuracy of our equations can not be judged until a number of numerical studies are performed .",
    "firstly , a temporal discretization needs to be developed to go with the spatial discretization ( [ sdefin ] ) ; the required tools are readily available @xcite .",
    "secondly , it is important to study the numerical aspects of the petrov - galerkin fem discretization developed here using existing numerical analysis tools @xcite and compare to existing discretizations .",
    "lastly , one needs to include immersed particles in the numerics as well and study a number of standard test problems to evaluate the performance of ( [ sdefin ] ) as a standalone method for simulating dilute colloidal suspensions .",
    "particular emphasis should be payed to the violations of discrete fluctuation dissipation balance and of translational invariance , both of which are in a formal sense second order in the grid spacing , but may be significant in practice at scales comparable to the grid spacing .",
    "it is an important task for future work to perform molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations and compare the results to the coarse - grained description proposed here .",
    "we expect that if the grid cells are too small we will see unphysical artifacts , and if the grid cells are too large , the md simulations will become unfeasible . by confirming whether the correct effective ( renormalized ) diffusion coefficient",
    "is obtained over a reasonable range of grid spacings , we can access how good the approximations made in our coarse graining theory are , and ultimately how useful the proposed equations are in practice .",
    "one should begin these studies with a single nanocolloidal particle in solvent in a periodic box of varying sizes , perhaps starting in two dimensions , where there are very strong ( in fact , asymptotically dominant rather than decaying ) finite size effects @xcite .",
    "a key question that we did not fully address here is how to compute the various coefficients that appear in ( [ sdefin ] ) .",
    "we already discussed the subtlety of this issue for the bare diffusion coefficient .",
    "even more freedom exists for the free energy of interaction between the solute and the solvent , which needs to be modeled with some number of adjustable parameters .",
    "these parameters are to be tuned by matching the coarse - grained and microscopic descriptions .",
    "how to do this matching in practice remains an important open question .",
    "we proposed a specific model with a single adjustable parameter here but it remains to be seen whether this model is appropriate on a case - by - case basis , and if not , to make adjustments to the equations by following the approach developed in this work .    it is important to emphasize here that ( [ sdefin ] ) can be used to study colloidal suspensions of more than one colloidal particle , however , the description will only be accurate when the colloids are further than about one grid cell apart .",
    "this is because our modeling of the bare diffusion coefficient is based on equilibrium green - kubo expressions for a single particle .",
    "this will fail to give an accurate approximation when two particles come closer to each other than a grid spacing ; at such short distances the hydrodynamic correlations among the diffusing particles will _ not _ be captured accurately .",
    "this is no different from prior work @xcite where the hydrodynamic interactions are only resolved up to at most the stokeslet or rotne - prager level .",
    "furthermore , when the nanocolloids come close to each other we expect that their direct interactions with the solvent molecules or with each other will be affected and other terms in ( [ sdefin ] ) will need to modified as well .",
    "ultimately , as the density is increased there will be many nanoparticles per hydrodynamic cell and in this case a coarse - grained theory of fluid mixtures should emerge . such a theory could perhaps provide a bridge between macroscopic fluid mixture equations @xcite and dynamic density functional theories with hydrodynamic effects @xcite .    finally , the present theory is isothermal as the energy density of the fluid is assumed to be a fast decaying variable as compared with mass and momentum variables .",
    "of course , this precludes the study of thermal processes that arise in nanocolloidal suspensions in the presence of thermal gradients .",
