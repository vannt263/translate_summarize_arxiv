    "pair production in strong background fields has been one of the most important issues in theoretical physics since the computation of the one - loop effective action in a constant electromagnetic field by heisenberg and euler@xcite and schwinger@xcite and the discovery of the black hole radiation by hawking@xcite .",
    "the virtual pairs from vacuum fluctuations are separated into real pairs by the strong electric field in the schwinger mechanism and by the causal horizon of the black hole in the hawking radiation , as summarized in table 1 .",
    "the pair production is accompanied by the vacuum polarization , that is , the real part of the nonperturbative effective action . in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , for instance , the mean number of pairs or the vacuum persistence ( twice the imaginary part of the effective action ) is closed related to the pole structure of the vacuum polarization . in the in - out formalism based on the schwinger variational principle , the effective action is the scattering matrix amplitude between the in- and the out - vacua , which can be manifestly realized by the bogoliubov transformation method@xcite .    in this talk",
    ", we revisit the new approach to the vacuum polarization and the hawking radiation of a schwarzschild black hole in analogy with the heisenberg - euler and schwinger effective action in qed@xcite .",
    "though it results from quantum field theory at one - loop , not from quantum gravity , the nonperturbative effective action , however , may still shed light on quantum aspects of black holes .",

    "the hawking radiation of bosons and fermions from a charged rotating black hole is given by@xcite @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the amplification factor , @xmath2 the angular momentum of the hole , @xmath3 the electric potential and @xmath4 the surface gravity on the event horizon . in the case of the zero amplification factor ,",
    "the vacuum persistence is @xmath5 note the change of sign in contrary to the qed case .",
    "a four - dimensional schwarzschild black hole with mass @xmath6 has the inverse temperature @xmath7 . denoting @xmath8 , with the spherical harmonics @xmath9 and the polarization @xmath10 and the energy @xmath11 , the bogoliubov coefficients for a massless boson field are found@xcite @xmath12 now the effective action ( [ eff act ] ) takes the form @xmath13",
    "employing the @xmath14-regularization , we find the effective action per unit horizon area@xcite @xmath15 .",
    "\\label{bh act}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is remarkable that the effective action ( [ bh act ] ) and the vacuum persistence ( [ bh per ] ) have the form ( [ qed act ] ) and ( [ qed per ] ) of spinor qed in a constant electric field .",
    "the vacuum persistence quantifies the decay rate of the vacuum due to the schwinger mechanism or the hawking radiation .",
    "further , it is known that the trace anomalies explain the vacuum persistence , that is , the schwinger mechanism and the hawking radiation .",
    "in fact , the vacuum persistence for bosons per unit horizon area@xcite @xmath16 is equal to the total flux from the gravitational anomalies@xcite .",
    "we have presented the one - loop effective action for qed in a constant electric field and the hawking radiation of a schwarzchild black hole in the in - out formalism .",
    "it consists of the vacuum polarization and the vacuum persistence responsible for pair production .",
    "the prominent feature of the nonperturbative effective action for a schwarzschild black hole is that it shares many features in common with spinor qed effective action in a constant electric field .",
    "there remain a few questions to be further pursued : firstly , to find the local effective action outside the horizon , secondly , to investigate the amplification ( grey body ) factor , and thirdly , to find the effective action at two - loop and higher loops .",
    "still another interesting question is the schwinger effect in a reissner - nrstrom black hole",
    ". finally , the origin of spin - statistics inversion of qed differently from gravity challenges a further study@xcite .",
