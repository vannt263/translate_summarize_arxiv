    "the problem of divergences affecting large orders in perturbation theory is well known @xcite , and is often seen as an academic problem which reflects the asymptotic nature of perturbative series .",
    "this problem however is brought to an entirely new level when the perturbation theory breakdown is realised already at the leading order .",
    "the physical quantities of interest in this case are associated with the scattering processes involving high multiplicities @xmath0 of particles produced in the final state in the @xmath2 limit . at sufficiently high energies the production of such high multiplicity final states with @xmath0 greater than the inverse coupling constant , becomes kinematically allowed and the @xmath0-point scattering amplitudes can become large already at leading order ",
    "i.e. tree level in a weakly coupled theory .",
    "the motivation of this paper is to study the behaviour of scattering processes involving large numbers massive vector bosons and higgs bosons produced at high energy collisions .",
    "the underlying model is a spontaneously broken gauge theory , and the amplitudes will be computed on and off the multi - particle threshold , thus generalising the previously available results for the on - threshold amplitudes in @xcite .    in the case of the @xmath3-type",
    "scalar field theories , there is a direct link between the number of contributing feynman diagrams , which grows as @xmath4 at large @xmath0 , and the and the overall expressions for the scattering amplitudes @xmath5 .",
    "multi - particle amplitudes in scalar theory were studied in detail in the 90s and were found to exhibit factorial growth leading to the ultimate breakdown of the standard weakly - coupled perturbation theory , as reviewed in @xcite , see also refs .",
    "however , this direct connection between the on - shell quantities and the number of feynman diagrams does not hold in gauge theory because of the cancellations between individual diagrams which is a consequence of gauge invariance and the on - shell conditions .",
    "nevertheless , it was shown in @xcite that in the case of spontaneously broken gauge theories , the amplitudes still grow factorially with the numbers of emitted higgses as well as massive vector bosons .",
    "there are two objectives for our study : one is to demonstrate that the breakdown of perturbation theory previously found in scalar qfts also applies to the weak sector of the standard model  or more precisely in any spontaneously broken gauge theory , and for amplitudes in a generic non - relativistic kinematics . our second point is to emphasise that the energies and multiplicities involved are not unreachable with future particle experiments .",
    "there is an exciting possibility that these processes can be probed at the next generation of hadron colliders .",
    "the simple estimates carried out in this paper , however , will assume a conservative non - relativistic limit which is not well - suited for drawing phenomenological conclusions about the lower limit on the energy scale where the weakly coupled perturbation theory would become strong .",
    "another motivation for studying the high - multiplicity production in the electroweak sector at high energies is their analogy and a potential complementarity with the topologically non - trivial transitions over the sphaleron barrier @xcite which violate the baryon plus lepton ( @xmath6 ) number in the sm . the common point between these two types of processes",
    "is the high multiplicities of the vector bosons and higgs particles in the final state . in both cases",
    "this is the regime where ordinary perturbation theory breaks down .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in the following section we will describe the method for computing the amplitudes on and off the multi - particle threshold in the double - scaling high - multiplicity low - kinetic - energy limit we introduce .",
    "this technique is first applied to a scalar theory with a non - trivial vacuum expectation value of the field . in section 3",
    "this method is applied to our main case of interest  the gauge - higgs theory .",
    "the phase - space integration is described in section 4 , and our conclusions are presented in section 5 .",
    "our main results for the amplitudes are in eqs .  - , and the cross section in the non - relativistic limit is given in eqs .  , .",
    "our approach for computing tree - level high - multiplicity amplitudes in the gauge - higgs theory is based on solving recursion relations between the @xmath0-point amplitudes involving massive vector and higgs bosons for different values of @xmath0 . in the high - multiplicity regime",
    ", the outgoing particles will have non - relativistic velocities as they are produced not far above their mass thresholds , thus we can simplify the amplitudes recursion relations by assuming the non - relativistic limit .",
    "the main features of the method are best explained following a simple example of a single real scalar field @xmath7 with non - vanishing vev @xmath8 @xmath9 this scalar theory with the spontaneously broken @xmath10 @xmath11 symmetry can be seen as a simplified version of the higgs sector of the sm in the unitary gauge . in the following section we will apply this approach to our main case of interest  the gauge - higgs theory .",
    "the goal of the present section is to derive a simple prescription for writing down the relevant recursion relations between the amplitudes in the example of a relatively straightforward scalar qft case .",
    "our results for the scalar theory are new , while our approach is similar to ref .",
    "@xcite where the unbroken @xmath3 theory was considered .",
    "tree - level amplitudes for production of @xmath0 bosons from a virtual single - boson state , @xmath12 , are classical objects ( no loops , @xmath13 ) , it is well - known that their generating functionals satisfies classical equations of motion with an external source . by differentiating @xmath0 times with respect to the source and setting it to zero ,",
    "one obtains the recursion recursion relations for the tree amplitudes , or currents , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "we introduce the physical vev - less scalar @xmath14 , describing bosons of mass @xmath15 .",
    "it satisfies the classical equation arising from , @xmath16 this classical equation in momentum space allows one to read - off directly the structure of the recursion relation for tree - level scattering amplitudes as follows : @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the incoming momentum , and the sums over @xmath19 involve permutations across the sets of momenta @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and/or @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 of the the individual amplitudes on the right hand side of eq .  .",
    "the special case of where all outgoing @xmath0 particles are produced on their mass threshold , i.e. with vanishing spatial momenta @xmath23 , is particularly simple . here",
    "the amplitudes are constants , the kinematics is trivial and one can sum over the permutations with the result , @xmath24 the solution of this momentum - independent recursion relation can be captured and recast in terms of the the amplitudes generating function which solves the original euler - lagrange equation for the @xmath25-independent field @xmath26 with the initial condition @xcite , @xmath27 the generating function for the on - shell amplitudes is a complex - valued solution of which contains only the positive - energy harmonics , @xmath28 . for a fixed @xmath0",
    "each plain wave describes the @xmath0-particle final state at rest with @xmath0 bosons of mass @xmath29 .",
    "hence the generating function is a holomorphic function of the complex argument @xmath30 , @xmath31 with the individual @xmath0-point amplitudes on the multi - particle threshold given by , @xmath32 substituting the taylor expansion into the classical equation , one immediately finds the recursion relation between the coefficients @xmath33 , @xmath34 which , as expected , is equivalent to eq .",

    "@xcite , @xmath38 the main lesson of this exercise was to show that our tree - level threshold amplitudes @xmath39 grow factorially with the number of final particles @xmath0 .",
    "however , our main concern are the amplitudes above the threshold , and so we need to recover their dependence on the kinematics of the final state .",
    "away from the multi - particle threshold , the external particles 3-momenta @xmath40 are non - vanishing and in the non - relativistic limit which we will adopt , they are small compared to the particle masses . in this limit",
    "we can characterise the process in the com frame by the non - relativistic kinetic energy @xmath41 of the final particles . in general kinematics ,",
    "the amplitudes are determined by the recursion relation which we need to solve .",
    "amplitudes _ on _ the threshold were already found in ; they correspond to @xmath42 . at small values of @xmath43 the leading correction to these amplitudes turns out to be proportional to @xmath41 itself .",
    "this fact is simply the consequence of the permutation symmetry acting on the particle momenta @xmath40 and of the galilean invariance of the amplitude @xcite .",
    "hence , the scattering amplitude in the non - relativistic approximation takes the form : @xmath44 where @xmath35 is the threshold amplitude , @xmath45 denotes the leading order momentum - dependent contribution , and @xmath46 is the kinetic energy per particle per mass , @xmath47 in the non - relativistic limit we have @xmath48 .",

    "<S> using the classical recursion relations we compute scattering amplitudes in a spontaneously broken gauge  higgs theory into final states involving high multiplicities of massive vector bosons and higgs bosons . </S>",

    "<S> our results generalise the previously known expressions for the amplitudes on the multi - particle thresholds to a more non - trivial kinematic domain . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the amplitudes in spontaneously broken gauge theories grow factorially with the numbers of particles produced , and that this factorial growth is only mildly affected by the energy - dependent formfactor computed in the non - relativistic limit . </S>",

    "<S> cross sections are obtained by integrating the amplitudes squared over the non - relativistic phase - space and found to grow exponentially at energy scales in a few hundred tev range if we use the non - relativistic high multiplicity limit . </S>",
