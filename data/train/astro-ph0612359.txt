    "in the last years it has been observed that various ultra - high energy cosmic ray ( uhecr ) data sets exhibit correlations with the bl lacertae objects ( bl lac ) at different level of significance @xcite .",
    "recently , the hires stereo data have appeared which have unprecedented angular resolution of @xmath2 . this dataset shows correlations with bl lacs at the angular scale compatible with the angular resolution .",
    "the statistical significance of the correlation is estimated to be of the order of @xmath3 ( 11 coincidences observed at @xmath4 expected in the absence of correlations ) @xcite .",
    "the absence of adjustable cuts makes it straightforward , for the first time , to predict the signal which should be observed in the future datasets if bl lacs are sources of the ultra - high energy cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "a most striking feature of the correlation found in the hires data is that it occurs at an angle which is much smaller than the typical deflection of a proton of corresponding energy in the galactic magnetic field ( gmf ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate whether the existence of such correlations can be explained within the standard model , i.e. , assuming only known particles and interactions .",
    "we will argue that this is extremely unlikely , if not impossible .    in order to proceed with the argument we need to make several assumptions .",
    "although these assumptions are plausible , they may not be valid .",
    "if this be the case , the results of our analysis should be reconsidered .",
    "the assumptions are as follows :    * the fraction of correlating events at energy @xmath5  ev is larger than @xmath6% . *",
    "the galactic magnetic field around earth location has a coherent component with the strength of order @xmath7 . * the distances to bl lacs which are counterparts ( sources ) of correlating events are larger than @xmath8  mpc .",
    "the validity of the assumption i ) has been discussed in detail in refs .",
    "note that it is implicitly assumed here that energies of cosmic rays are measured correctly .",
    "the assumption ii ) is the widely accepted value of the galactic magnetic field in the vicinity of the earth ( for recent reviews see , e.g. , refs .",
    "the precise magnitude of mgf is not important for the argument ; its variations by a factor 2 - 3 would not change our conclusions .",
    "finally , the assumption iii ) is needed because some of the bl lacs which contribute to correlations have unknown redshifts .",
    "it is usually expected that these redshifts exceed @xmath9 .",
    "given the assumptions i)iii ) , the argument proceeds as follows .",
    "the deflection of a @xmath10  ev proton in the @xmath11 g coherent field extending over 1 kpc is @xmath12 .",
    "most of the events , however , have much lower energies ( for the events of energies @xmath5  ev with the spectrum falling like @xmath13 the median energy is @xmath14  ev ) .",
    "since the correlating events follow the same distribution @xcite , their typical deflections would be @xmath15 .",
    "the correlation with the sources would therefore be destroyed . at such a small angular scale",
    "as observed , the correlations can survive in the following cases only :    * there exist `` windows '' in the galactic magnetic field with a very low value of the coherent component . *",
    "a fraction of primary particles is neutral . *",
    "a fraction of primaries is converted to neutral particles before entering the galactic magnetic field , i.e. , at least 1  kpc from the earth ( assuming the galactic magnetic field does not extend further than @xmath6  kpc from the disk ) .",
    "we consider these three possibilities in sects.ii-v . in this paper",
    "we limit ourselves to mechanisms which are based on particles and interactions existing in the standard model .",
    "we show that none of such mechanisms can explain the observed correlation , unless very unlikely assumptions are made . in the last sect.vi",
    "we summarize the arguments and present the conclusions .",
    "the galactic magnetic field ( gmf ) consists of two components , the coherent and the turbulent one .",
    "the existence of the coherent component is the main reason why the uhecr - bl lacs correlations at @xmath16 ev can not be explained by protons . in models which are currently in use , the coherent gmf extends to the whole galaxy , being described by a simple analytic function .",
    "however , such a picture is probably an oversimplification .",
    "observationally , there are many anomalies and features in the galactic magnetic field .",
    "it is not totally excluded that the coherent component is `` patchy '' . in other words , there may exist `` windows '' where the coherent component is negligible . in this case",
    "the ultra - high energy protons may cross the gmf undeflected when they come from the directions of these `` windows '' .",
    "one may thus try to explain the observed correlations by the existence of such windows .    for this mechanism to work the random component of the gmf in windows",
    "also has to satisfy some requirements .",
    "the deflections of protons in the random field is estimated as follows @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the energy of proton , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the rms value and the coherence length of the random magnetic field , respectively , while @xmath21 is the propagation distance .",
    "this deflection has to be ( much ) smaller than @xmath22 .",
    "the coherence length @xmath20 is the most uncertain of the above parameters",
    ". quite often a large values of @xmath20 up to @xmath23  pc are assumed . on the contrary , in those regions of the sky where the spectrum of the magnetic field fluctuations was measured , @xmath20 turns out to be small @xcite .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite the linearly polarized continuum emission was studied in the test region near the galactic plane covering the range @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "polarized emission was found to originate mainly at the distance of @xmath26 kpc .",
    "interestingly , two large areas of a few square degrees each were found to be devoid of polarization .",
    "it was argued that these voids were produced by the foreground in which the magnetic field is disordered , with the coherence length being @xmath27 pc . in these voids ,",
    "the projection of the coherent component of the magnetic field on the line of sight was found to be @xmath28 of the rms value of the random field strength . in the rest of the test region ,",
    "i.e. outside of the voids , the coherence length is much larger , but still the outer scale of turbulence did not exceed @xmath29  pc @xcite .",
    "thus , the existence of regions with @xmath30 does not seem impossible .",
    "this mechanism has a specific signature which is straightforward to test .",
    "if there exist `` windows '' with the small coherent component of gmf , the faraday rotation measures must be small in these windows as well .",
    "in other words , the faraday rotations in the directions of correlating uhecr events must be anomalously small .",
    "this may be tested statistically by comparing the distribution of faraday rotations in the direction of _ correlating _ events with the distribution of faraday rotations in the random directions selected according to the distribution of bl lacs and _ all _ cosmic ray events .",
    "we have performed this test with the existing data and found that the two distributions are indeed different ( faraday rotations in the directions selected with real data are anomalously small ) with the significance of @xmath31 according to the kolmogorov - smirnov test .",
    "this is not a very significant deviation .",
    "the result demonstrates , however , that the method may work quite well with the future larger datasets .",
    "although the existence of `` windows '' in the coherent component of the galactic magnetic field goes against the standard lore , a much better understanding of the galactic magnetic field is required to definitely rule it out .      for the mechanism outlined above to work ,",
    "the extragalactic magnetic fields have to satisfy certain requirements ( which also apply to the scenarios considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : conversion ] ) .",
    "the extragalactic magnetic fields are not measured .",
    "computer simulations indicate @xcite that the magnetic field strength in voids between clusters can be very small , @xmath32 , while the coherence length can easily be significantly smaller than 1 mpc .",
    "( [ fstestimeate ] ) then shows that the deflections in voids are negligible .",
    "it is interesting to note that egmf with such small magnitude are in principle measurable in observations of tev gamma - rays from distant blazars @xcite .",
    "the strength of the field in filaments is larger .",
    "however , the probability to cross many filaments is small and regions with small deflections can occupy rather large fraction of the sky area @xcite ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "overall , the model where the extragalactic magnetic fields are sufficiently small and do not spoil correlations is acceptable at present .",
    "among known neutral particles the following are sufficiently stable to propagate over extragalactic distances : neutrino , photon and atoms . in this section",
    "we discuss the possibility to explain correlations by assuming that primary cosmic rays are composed of these particles .",
    "both neutrino and photon initiate air showers deeper in the atmosphere than the hadronic primary particles .",
    "therefore , these models can be falsified with already existing data by , e.g. , comparing the @xmath33 distributions of the correlating events with that of the whole set . since",
    "the corresponding data are still unpublished , we briefly discuss the models based on neutrino and photon and show that they have difficulties _ per se _ , even without referring to @xmath33 distributions .",

    "therefore , the optical depth of the atmosphere for neutrinos is @xmath37 . on the other hand , at this energy the neutrino flux can not exceed the flux of hadronic cosmic rays by more than a factor of @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "it follows that at most @xmath39 of all cosmic ray events can be due to neutrinos .",
    "this is more than a factor of 10 lower than needed to explain correlations .",
    "thus , neutrino with the standard weak interactions can not explain correlations observed in the hires data set .",
    "a `` genuine '' ( hypothetical ) neutrino mechanism would involve strong neutrino interactions with the atmosphere at high energies @xcite .",
    "as such a behavior in not a part of the standard model , the corresponding speculations fall outside of the scope of the present paper .",
    "another possibility which exists within the minimal extention of the standard model by the non - zero neutrino masses , the @xmath40-burst mechanism @xcite , requires an unnaturally large flux of neutrinos at @xmath41 ev which is in conflict with the limits on neutrino flux from radio experiments @xcite .",
    "the particles observed at earth in this mechanism are mostly photons produced in the interactions of uhe neutrinos with the cosmological neutrino background on their way to the earth .",

    "these leading particles in turn compton up - scatter cmbr photons to the energy almost equal to the energy of the original photon .",
    "this process is usually referred to as the electromagnetic cascade .",
    "the developing electromagnetic cascade can reach the earth from several hundred megaparsecs with energy @xmath43 ev if the following conditions are satisfied :    * the radio - background is small , smaller than the theoretically expected value ; * the injection spectrum @xmath44 is hard , @xmath45 ; * maximum energy of photons at the source reaches @xmath46 ev * egmf are small , @xmath47 g ; * sources are predominantly photonic , @xmath48 .",

    "one finds @xmath54 thus , the fraction of neutral particles ( atoms ) produced by this mechanism is of the order of @xmath55 , which is too small to explain correlations .    as a side remark note that for a heavy nuclei the rates of radiative capture and ionization",

    "we consider various mechanisms of neutron creation in or near the galaxy .",
    "there are several ways to produce neutrons in the standard model : photodisintegration of nuclei , photoproduction on background photons by protons , creation in @xmath36 reactions and in inverse @xmath60-decay on background neutrinos or photons .",
    "we consider these mechanisms in turn and argue that none of them can produce a sufficient fraction of neutrons in the cosmic ray flux .",

    "there remains a possibility of the astrophysical solution , which is related to our insufficient knowledge of the galactic magnetic field .",
    "the observed tight correlations can potentially be explained if there exist `` windows '' in the galactic magnetic field with a very low value of the coherent component of the field and a small coherence length of the turbulent component .",
    "though this possibility is exotic , it can not be ruled out at present .    the mechanisms which we have discussed in this paper",
    "are based on the known physics , i.e. they certainly operate in nature provided the cosmic ray flux contains light nuclei or protons .",
    "one of these mechanisms , the conversion of protons to neutrons , implies that at energies around @xmath150  ev a few percent of the ultra - high energy protons ( cf .",
    "[ fig : f ] ) get converted into neutrons and cross the galactic magnetic field undeflected .",
