    "in description of multiparticle production processes one often uses statistical methods and concepts which follow the classical boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) approach .",
    "however , it was demonstrated recently that to account for the long range correlations and for some intrinsic fluctuations in the hadronizing system one should rather use the nonextensive tsallis statistics @xcite , in which one new parameter @xmath1 describes summarily the possible departure from the usual bg case ( which is recovered in the @xmath3 limit ) @xcite .",
    "here we shall provide detail description of the rapidity spectra of particles ( mostly pions ) produced in @xmath0 collisions using the anomalous diffusion approach to this problem and in this way accounting for their non - equilibrium character .",
    "this method originates from diffusion model approach to nuclear multiparticle production collisions developed in @xcite , which has been further ( successfully ) applied to the recent rhic data in @xcite .",
    "the first attempt to extend it also to the case of anomalous diffusion ( which corresponds to nonextensive @xmath4 case ) has been presented recently for nuclear collisions @xcite .",
    "the non - linear fokker - planck ( fp ) equation used in this case has form ( @xmath5 with @xmath6 being rapidity and @xmath7 time variable ) : @xmath8 @xmath9 and @xmath10 are diffusion and drift coefficients respectively .",
    "the hadronization process is visualized here as diffusion in the rapidity space starting with rapidities ( in cms frame ) @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is invariant energy of reaction and @xmath13 mean transverse mass kept here as given . in the approaches",
    "presented in @xcite and @xcite linear or constant drift coefficients has been used and in effect obtained double gaussian - like form of rapidity spectra were already postulated and used on purely phenomenological grounds as simple parametrizations of results of string models allowing for fast numerical calculations of cosmic ray cascades @xcite . ] . as was demonstrated in @xcite for drift proportional to the longitudinal momentum of the particle ( i.e. , @xmath14 ) one gets the thermal ( boltzmann ) distribution ( for linear fp equation , i.e. , for @xmath15 ) whereas for nonlinear - fp equation the time dependent solution has the specific power - like form the norm of which is conserved only for @xmath16 , therefore @xmath17 and our distribution is given by the following formula : @xmath18^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}. \\label{eq : form}\\ ] ]",
    "we show now results of fitting experimental data on rapidity distributions of secondaries produced in @xmath0 collisions @xcite by using formula ( [ eq : form ] ) in the following form :    ( 8.0,8.0 )    @xmath19 where @xmath20^{\\frac{1}{(1-q)}}\\ ] ] with @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath1 being the ( energy dependent ) parameters ( the values of transverse mass @xmath23 was in this case taken as fixed and equal to @xmath24 gev , its possible energy dependence ( for example such as used in ( [ eq : inel ] ) below ) is then hidden in the energy dependence of the parameter @xmath21 ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "1 ( for ua5 @xcite and tevatron @xcite data ) where the following energy dependences of @xmath21 , @xmath25 and @xmath1 were used : @xmath26 the values of coefficients are : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "it turns out that the same parameters can also fit data from p238 @xcite and ua7 @xcite groups obtained for different rapidity regions at energy @xmath33 gev , cf .",
    "it is interesting that although our @xmath22 is not supposed to be _ a priori _ connected with the values of the maximal possible rapidities at given energy , @xmath34 , nevertheless we have found that ratio @xmath35 changes only weakly with energy varying between @xmath36 and @xmath37 gev from @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "notice also that for small values of @xmath40 eq.([eq : fq ] ) can be aproximated by double quasi - gaussian form ( which becomes pure double gausian function in the limit of @xmath3 )",
    ". +    ( 8.0,8.0 )     + it is well known that the charged particle multiplicity distributions may well be fitted by a negative binomial distribution ( nb ) @xcite .",
    "it has two parameters : mean charged multiplicity @xmath41 , and the parameter @xmath42 @xmath43 affecting its shape ( width ) ( for @xmath44 nb approaches geometrical distributions whereas for @xmath45 it approaches poisson distribution ) .",
    "the observed widening of the normalized multiplicity distribution with increasing energy implies then that parameter @xmath42 decrreases with energy .",
    "following ideas expressed in @xcite we would like to bring ones attention to the fact that the value of parameter @xmath46 may be understood as the measure of fluctuations of mean multiplicity .",
    "when one starts with poisson multiplicity distribution and then allows @xmath41 to fluctuate according to gamma distribution with normalized variance given by @xmath47 then it is easy to show @xcite that as result one gets nb distribution with @xmath48 .",
    "namely : +    ( 8.0,8.0 )     + @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "it is worth to notice that , indeed , the energy variation of parameter @xmath1 is almost the same as @xmath46 ( see fig .",
    "the small discrepancies observed there , namely the fact that @xmath51 is consistently larger than @xmath46 , can be explained by realizing that our @xmath1 has been obtained from fitting the experimental distributions @xmath52 and therefore it contains in addition to the above mentioned fluctuations in @xmath41 also fluctuations in inelasticity @xmath53 , not discussed here . in any case",
    "it is at this moment tempting to assume that the nonextensive parameter @xmath1 ( parametrizing already nonlinearity of our fp equation used to describe data ) also describes those fluctuations .    in fig .",
    "4 we show the total inelasticity @xmath54 obtained by integrating spectra given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : fq ] ) with parameters obtained from the fit to the corresponding rapidity distributions @xmath55 as function of the invariant energy of the reaction @xmath12 both for the energies considered here and extrapolated to the lhc energy . in this case the values of transverse mass @xmath23 for a given energy was obtained by using simple interpolating formula : @xmath56 .",
    "as one can see in fig .",
    "4 such inelasticity @xmath57 is decreasing with the energy . +    ( 8.0,8.0 )",
    "we have provided here description of rapidity spectra of particles produced at cern and fermilab energies treating their formation as diffusion process in rapidity space . to account for the anomalous character of such diffusion , the nonlinear form of focker - planck equation has been used with nonlinearity described by parameter @xmath1 , the same as the nonextensivity parameter describing the underlying tsallis statistics . as seen in figs .",
    "1 and 2 , very good agreement with data has been obtained with apparently three parameters : the `` temperature '' @xmath21 , position of the peak at rapidity @xmath22 and parameter @xmath1 - all logaritmically dependent on the energy of reaction @xmath12 .",
    ", what means that nonlinearity expressed by @xmath58 here is essential feature of the data .",
    "] however , after closer inspection it turns out that parameter @xmath1 , which according to @xcite can be regarded as a measure of fluctuations existing in the physical system under consideration , follows essentiall the fluctuations of multiplicity of particles produced at given energy .",
    "the small differences noticed in fig .",
    "3 are , in our opinion , caused entirely by the fluctuations in the inelasticity of the reaction , which makes the initial energy available for the production of secondaries a fluctuating quantity .",
    "similarly , parameter @xmath22 seems to be closely connected with the maximal available rapidity @xmath59 .",
    ", i.e. , it depends in the indirect way on the inelasticty @xmath53 of the reaction .",
    "we have not pursued this problem here .",
    "] this shows that the only parameter which is entirely `` free '' is the limiting temperature @xmath21 . )",
    "contains in itself also the possible energy dependence of the mean transverse mass @xmath23 , not accounted for in the formula ( [ eq : fq ] ) . ]",
    "therefore we can say that what we are proposing here is essentially one - parameter fit successfully describing data on rapidity distributions .",
    "the resultant inelasticity @xmath53 ( defined by the formula ( [ eq : inel ] ) ) turns out to be decreasing function of energy , as seen in fig .",
    "4 , confirming our previous findings in that matter @xcite . we would like to bring ones attention to the fact that in our approach we can fit equally well ( using the same set of parameters ) data obtained by p238 @xcite and ua7 @xcite collaborations which cover different regions in rapidity .",
    "this makes extrapolation of our formula to higher rapidity region more credible and therefore puts more weight on the obtained energy behaviour of inelasticity .",
