    "conformal gravity ( cg ) @xcite was proposed as a possible alternative to einstein gravity ( `` gr '' ) , which may supply the proper framework for a solution to some of the most annoying problems of theoretical physics like those of the cosmological constant , the dark matter and the dark energy .",
    "the gravitational field in cg is still minimally coupled to matter , but the dynamical basis is different : it is obtained by replacing the einstein - hilbert action with the weyl action based on the weyl ( or _ conformal _ ) tensor @xmath1 defined as the totally traceless part of the riemann tensor : @xmath2 so the gravitational lagrangian is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "the gravitational field equations take the following form : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the energy - momentum tensor and @xmath7 is the bach tensor given by w^= r_c^-2__c^ [ bachtensorintermsofc ] , or in terms of the riemann and ricci components by : @xmath8    it was suggested ( see @xcite and references therein ) that while cg agrees with newtonian gravity in solar system scales , it further produces a linearly growing potential that could explain galactic rotation curves without invoking dark matter .",
    "it was further argued that accelerating cosmological solutions of cg describe naturally the accelerated expansion of the universe thus removing the need for dark energy .",
    "on the other hand , cg has been criticized from several aspects both phenomenological and formal .",
    "arguments in favor of the need of dark matter come from observations of the unusual object called `` bullet cluster '' @xcite whose dynamics seems very difficult to understand without assuming a weekly interacting dark component .    more specifically , several authors claim that predictions in the weak field limit of cg disagree with solar system observations @xcite , yield wrong light deflection @xcite and that the exterior solutions can not be matched to any source with a `` reasonable '' mass distribution @xcite .",
    "other authors find evidence for tachyons or ghosts @xcite or raise the fact that only null geodesics are physically meaningful in this theory since the `` standard '' point particle lagrangian is not conformally - invariant @xcite .    counter arguments to some of these objections were also published @xcite , as well as possible ways @xcite out of some of the difficulties and the matter is , to our view , still waiting for a consensus .",
    "it is therefore very much required to investigate further the predictions and consequences of cg in its purely tensorial formulation as well as in its scalar tensor extension as much as possible .    in this work",
    "we concentrate on cylindrically - symmetric static vacuum solutions with the aim of clarifying further the properties of string - like solutions in cg @xcite .",
    "cosmic strings @xcite are a typical outcome in any field theory which describes matter in the very early universe , thus serving very well the purpose of testing the implications of cg .",
    "the main result reported here is the full family of the static cylindrically - symmetric vacuum solutions of cg which represent the external gravitational field of localized line sources .",
    "the general static cylindrically symmetric line - element has the form : @xmath9    in order to find solutions for this system , we have to fix the arbitrariness of the radial coordinate and the arbitrary rescaling of the metric due to the conformal symmetry .",
    "we will also limit our solutions to those exhibiting boost symmetry along the string direction ( @xmath10 ) , as for ordinary cosmic strings , i.e. @xmath11 .",
    "this leaves one independent metric component .",
    "so only one of the gravitational field equations ( [ gravfieldeq ] ) ( with @xmath12 ) has to be solved .",
    "we may therefore choose to solve the lower order @xmath13 equation , i.e. @xmath14 .",
    "several special solutions are already known in explicit form .",
    "first of all , all the thin string ( line source ) solutions of gr with either a vanishing or non - vanishing cosmological constant @xcite which solve for @xmath15 r^_= ^ _ [ adseq ] satisfy also the cg vacuum equations @xmath16 .",
    "this is obvious by direct substitution of ( [ adseq ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ bachtensor ] ) .    one special member of the @xmath17 family is the ads soliton @xcite ( see also @xcite ) which is a cylindrically - symmetric regular solution of the same equation ( [ adseq ] ) and is therefore distinct from ads ( anti - de sitter ) space .",
    "more recently , we have discovered two families of very simple exact solutions @xcite during a mainly numerical study of cylindrical solutions of the abelian higgs model coupled to cg . however , we were unable to integrate the equations analytically at the time .    here",
    "we present a reduction of the vacuum equations for static cylindrically - symmetric solutions to a single first order non - linear equation which may be solved by a straightforward quadrature .",
    "we have therefore first to complete the gauge fixing .",
    "since we would like it to be consistent with the symmetric vacuum solutions [ i.e. ( a)ds spaces ] and with the ads soliton , it should respect the asymptotic condition @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a real parameter .",
    "note however , that a constant ricci scalar is not a `` gauge invariant '' concept in cg ; it is only a matter of convenience which can be obtained by a proper gauge choice .",
    "the corresponding invariant condition is that the weyl tensor will vanish asymptotically , that is spacetime becomes conformally flat asymptotically .",
    "these restrictions will simplify considerably the very cumbersome expressions of the components of the bach tensor and will enable a clear physical picture .",
    "the simplest gauge choice is @xmath20 with @xmath21 as a single metric component .",
    "this choice may be obtained directly from eq .",
    "( [ lineel ] ) by a suitable conformal transformation combined with a redefinition of the radial coordinate . in this gauge @xmath22 at the end of this section ] so it can not contain the well - known solutions with a cosmological constant of eq .",
    "( [ adseq ] ) .",
    "the cylindrical version of the `` mannheim gauge''@xcite @xmath23 with @xmath24 , turns out to be complicated and the simplifications from spherical symmetry are not observed .",
    "an alternative parametrization of the metric tensor which solves these difficulties is the following gauge choice [ gauge ] m = 1  ,  l= = b  ,  k(r ) = b(r ) where we also resort to dimensionless coordinates .",
    "this metric is equivalent to that of the `` mannheim gauge '' , but has the advantage that it leads to autonomous equations which we can solve by quadrature .",
    "note however , that this gauge excludes the `` flat '' @xmath25 solutions .",
    "conformally flat solutions are of course still allowed .    in this gauge",
    "the components of ricci tensor and scalar take the form r_0 ^ 0 = r_z^z = -()^2 - 2   ,   r_r^r = r_^= - - 2  ,   r = -2 [ ricci - bg ] while the rest vanish .    already at this stage",
    "we can obtain easily the constant ricci solutions of eq .",
    "( [ adseq ] ) .",
    "it is enough to solve the ( 00 ) equation which is readily integrated to give ( b)^2 + b^2 - = 0 [ constricci - bg ] where @xmath26 is the integration constant .",
    "this is a trivial `` mechanical '' equation whose solutions are easily obtained by inspection .",
    "we will discuss these solutions within the more general framework in the next section .",
    "the non - zero components of the weyl tensor are all proportional to a single quantity namely c^0r _  0r = c^0 _  0=c^rz _  rz = c^z _  z = c/6  ,  c^r _  r = c^0z _  0z =- c/3 [ weyltensorcomp ] where = -2+()^2 [ weylcomp ] , and its square is given simply by @xmath27 .",
    "the non - vanishing components of the bach tensor are @xmath28    @xmath29    while the fourth one , @xmath30 can be obtained immediately from the identity @xmath31 .",
    "using an exponential transformation @xmath32 simplifies the expressions a little . @xmath33 and",
    "the `` weyl tensor quantity '' @xmath34 which will be used in the following , become : @xmath35    an easy way to obtain @xmath36 is to start with the line element @xmath37 $ ] whose bach tensor is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is calculated from the metric @xmath40 .",

    "a further coordinate transformation @xmath45 together with @xmath46 yields after lengthy calculations the above components of the bach tensor of eqs .",
    "( [ bach00])-([bachrr ] ) . as a check",
    "we have verified that these components satisfy a covariant conservation law , @xmath47 which in the present case reduces to the single equation b b(w_r^r)+2(b b+b^2)w_r^r+2(b b-b^2)w_0 ^ 0=0 [ wconservation ] .",
    "we also calculated @xmath30 explicitly and verified that indeed @xmath31 .",
    "solving the equations becomes possible thanks to the following identity @xmath48   \\label{wrridentity}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which may be written as a total derivative in the following form : @xmath49 '    = \\frac{4}{3}\\frac{\\left(\\epsilon\\beta ' ' \\right)^{3/2 } e^{-3 \\beta /2}}{\\beta ' }    \\left [ \\frac{\\left(\\sqrt{\\epsilon e^{\\beta}\\beta ' ' } \\right)'}{\\left(e^{- \\beta}\\right ) ' }   \\right ] '   \\label{wrridentity2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 according to whether @xmath51 is positive or negative .",
    "the motivation to look for such identities comes from the fact that the components of bach tensor may be expressed in terms of the weyl tensor as in eq .",
    "( [ bachtensorintermsofc ] ) .",
    "although it may seem simpler to get solutions in other gauges like the mannheim gauge or in terms of the metric component @xmath52 defined above , we were able to integrate the equations in terms of @xmath53 ( or @xmath54 ) only .",
    "solving now the equation @xmath55 is straightforward and quite simple .",
    "we will use both @xmath56 and @xmath57 alternatively according to convenience .",
    "the first kind of solutions satisfies @xmath58 which is solved by b(r)=b_0 e^kr [ solexp ] where @xmath59 may be either positive or negative .",
    "the only other possibility is that the ratio @xmath60 in the second factor of ( [ wrridentity2 ] ) is a constant , say @xmath61 , so we obtain after two integrations the following `` mechanical '' equation ( )^2+(a+ce^-)^3 = e , c0 ; ( )^2+a^2 e^- = e , c=0 [ firstordermechbeta ] where @xmath62 and @xmath63 are integration constants .",
    "note that the special case @xmath64 needs special care .",
    "a special family of solutions of this case is the above ( [ solexp ] ) .",
    "others will be considered later . actually , it is easy to see from eqs ( [ bachrrbeta ] ) and ( [ wrridentity2 ] ) that @xmath64 corresponds to conformally flat solutions with vanishing weyl tensor .",

    ", the orbits in this case avoid @xmath167 . above the critical value no geodesics exist at all .",
    "a possible future application of these results is to use these families of exact solutions to analyze light bending in the vicinity of localized linear sources in cg .",
    "the analogous problem of light bending in spherically - symmetric gravitational field was only recently settled @xcite .",
