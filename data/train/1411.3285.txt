    "mathematical morphology @xcite has developed since the 1960s as a powerful theoretical framework from which versatile instruments for shape analysis in images can be derived , such as for structure - preserving denoising or shape simplification @xcite .",
    "the fundamental building blocks of classical mathematical morphology are non - linear local image filters like dilation , erosion , and median filters .",
    "they rely on aggregating intensities within a neighbourhood of any given pixel by e.g.  maximum , minimum , and median operations .",
    "the selection of neighbourhoods for processing is classically done by shifting a sliding window of fixed size and shape across the image . in the context of morphology , this sliding window is known as structuring element .",
    "more recently , concepts for adaptivity have been developed generally in image filtering and also specifically in morphology @xcite .",
    "one recent concept for adaptive morphology are morphological amoebas introduced by lerallut et al.@xcite .",
    "these are space - variant structuring elements constructed from a combination of spatial distance measurement with local contrast measurement via an amoeba metric .    in earlier work by the author of the present paper and his coauthors , properties of amoeba filters and their relations to",
    "image filters based on partial differential equations ( pdes ) were investigated @xcite . as an application to image segmentation ,",
    "an amoeba - based active contour method was designed @xcite .",
    "recently , a combination of edge - weighted graphs generated in the computation of amoebas with graph indices was used to introduce a new class of texture descriptors @xcite which are currently under further investigation .",
    "this paper reviews and summarises the results from these works . directions of ongoing research on this topic are sketched .    with focus on giving a comprehensive overview of the theory that has been developed in various earlier publications , the ( mostly lengthy ) proofs of the results",
    "are omitted here and referred to the respective original sources .",
    "nevertheless , the main principles underlying the proofs are shortly outlined .",
    "although amoeba filtering of multi - channel images has been addressed to some extent in @xcite , this aspect of the topic presents itself in a stage too early for a summarised presentation , and is therefore not included in the present paper .    in the following",
    "the structure of the paper is detailed , highlighting contributions that are novel in this presentation .",
    "section  [ sec : amoebas ] introduces the concept of morphological amoebas as image - adaptive structuring elements in the space - discrete as well as the space - continuous setting . to ease bridging to the graph techniques discussed later in section  [ sec : texture ] , the presentation in the discrete case emphasises the modelling of discrete images by neighbourhood graphs and uses standard terminology from graph theory , thereby following @xcite .",
    "the presentation of the space - continuous case is similar to that e.g.  in @xcite .",
    "the application of amoebas in image filtering is the topic of section  [ sec : filters ] .",
    "median filters , morphological dilation and erosion are presented together with their relationship to pde image filters , reproducing herein results from @xcite . regarding the association between amoeba metrics on the discrete filtering side and edge - stopping functions",
    "occurring in the corresponding pdes , the current work adds to the previously considered exemplary @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( euclidean ) amoeba metrics as a third simple case the @xmath3 ( maximum ) amoeba metric and states explicitly the corresponding edge - stopping function .",
    "moreover , the amoeba variants of morphological opening and closing are included in the description for the first time . for dilation , erosion , opening and closing filters , the presentation here emphasises the algebraic background including max - plus / min - plus convolution and conjugacy of structure elements .",
    "section  [ sec : seg ] considers the application of amoeba techniques to devise basic algorithms for unsupervised segmentation of grey - value images , namely the _ amoeba active contours ( aac ) _ first introduced in @xcite and further investigated in @xcite .",
    "results from @xcite on the relation between aac and geodesic active contours are reported .    in image filtering by nonlinear pdes ,",
    "one often computes the nonlinearities not from the input images themselves but from gaussian pre - smoothed versions of these , in order to reduce noise sensitivity of filters and to improve numerical stability .",
    "this is also the case with self - snakes and active contour pdes ; note that the self - snakes pde is even ill - posed without such pre - smoothing .",
    "section  [ sec : presmoothing ] investigates the effect of pre - smoothing in the self - snakes pde using perturbation analysis on a synthetic example ; furthermore , it discusses how a comparable stabilisation can be achieved in the amoeba median filter framework .",
    "the analysis presented in this section relies on previous work in @xcite in which oscillatory perturbations aligned with the gradient direction were studied , and extends it by including also perturbations aligned with the level line direction .",
    "section  [ sec : texture ] is devoted to a different direction of application of amoeba ideas .",
    "noticing that the computation of discrete amoeba structuring elements is intimately related with graph structures  a weighted neighbourhood graph , weighted and unweighted dijkstra search trees  in the neighbourhood of each pixel , one can try to extract local texture information from these graphs .",
    "quantitative graph theory @xcite offers a variety of graph indices for generating quantitative information from graph structures .",
    "the presentation of the construction of texture descriptors from amoebas and graph indices in this section follows @xcite .",
    "compared to the large set of descriptors covered in @xcite , only a few representatives are shown here , complementing their mathematical description by a visualised example . extending the previous work on texture discrimination in @xcite , the present paper also shows a first example of the new texture descriptors in texture segmentation by using the descriptors as components of an input image for multi - channel gac segmentation .",
    "well - known local image filters such as the mean filter , median filter , morphological dilation or erosion consist of two steps : a sliding - window _ selection _ step , and the _ aggregation _ of selected input values by taking e.g.  the arithmetic mean , median , maximum or minimum .",
    "a strategy to improve the sensitivity of such filters to important image structures is to modify the selection step by using spatially adaptive neighbourhoods instead of a fixed sliding window .",
    "the general idea is to give preference in the selection to neighbouring image locations with similar intensities , and thus to reduce the flow of grey - value information across high contrast steps or slopes in the filter process .",
    "first introduced by lerallut et al .  @xcite as structuring elements for adaptive morphology , morphological amoebas are a specific type of such spatially adaptive neighbourhoods .",
    "their construction relies on the combination of spatial distance in the image domain with grey - value contrast into a modified metric on the image .      to define morphological amoebas on discrete images , we start by considering edge - weighted graphs based on the image grid .",
    "let @xmath4 be a discrete image .",
    "construct an edge - weighted graph @xmath5 with vertex set @xmath6 , edge set @xmath7 and weights @xmath8 as follows .",
    "the vertex set @xmath6 is formed by all pixels of @xmath4 .",
    "two vertices @xmath9 , @xmath10 are connected , @xmath11 , if and only if pixels @xmath9 , @xmath10 are neighbours under a suitably chosen neighbourhood notion .",
    "to define the edge weights @xmath12 for an edge @xmath11 , consider the corresponding pixel locations @xmath13 and @xmath14 as well as the intensities @xmath15 and @xmath16 , and set @xmath12 to @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes euclidean distance in the image plane , @xmath19 is a contrast scale parameter weighting between spatial and tonal distances , and @xmath20 is a norm on @xmath21 which can be rewritten as @xmath22 with a monotonically increasing function @xmath23 ( by continuity , @xmath24 ) .    the edge - weighted graph @xmath25 is called _ neighbourhood graph _ of @xmath4 .    in this definition , neighbourhood can be understood as a 4-neighbourhood , as done in @xcite , or as an 8-neighbourhood as in @xcite .",
    "the latter choice gets somewhat closer to a euclidean measurement of spatial distances in the image plane and is therefore also considered the default in the present work .    as to the norm function @xmath26 , the setting @xmath27 corresponds to the @xmath1 metric also used in @xcite that gives @xmath28 whereas @xmath29 entails a euclidean ( @xmath2 ) metric in which the edge weights are obtained by the pythagorean sum @xmath30 a straightforward generalisation is @xmath31 which in the limit @xmath32 also includes @xmath33 and the corresponding edge weight @xmath34      we use the edge - weighted neighbourhood graph to define the discrete amoeba metric on image @xmath4 .    let a discrete image @xmath4 be given .",
    "let @xmath25 be its neighbourhood graph with edge weights given by .",
    "define for two pixels @xmath9 and @xmath10 their distance @xmath35 as the minimal total weight ( length ) among all paths between @xmath9 and @xmath10 in @xmath25 . then @xmath36 is called _",
    "( discrete ) amoeba metric _ on @xmath4 .",
    "the metric @xmath36 is called @xmath37 amoeba metric , @xmath38 , if it is derived from , or @xmath3 amoeba metric if it is obtained from @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath2 amoeba metric is also called euclidean amoeba metric .    in a discrete image @xmath4 with amoeba metric @xmath36 , an _ amoeba structuring element _ ( short : _ amoeba _ ) @xmath40 with amoeba radius @xmath41 and reference point at pixel",
    "@xmath9 is a discrete @xmath41-ball around pixel @xmath9 in the amoeba metric , i.e.  the set of all vertices within a distance @xmath41 from @xmath9 , @xmath42    the derivation of amoebas from a metric with a global radius parameter @xmath41 has an interesting consequence : for two pixels @xmath9 , @xmath10 , one has @xmath43 which is helpful in the design of some morphological filters .",
    "to compute amoebas in a discrete image , one has to search the neighbourhood of each given reference pixel @xmath9 in order to identify the pixels @xmath10 with amoeba distance @xmath44 .",
    "given that the edge weights @xmath12 in @xmath25 are nonnegative , this can be achieved by running dijkstra s shortest path algorithm @xcite on @xmath25 starting at pixel @xmath9 . as this algorithm enumerates neighbour pixels in order of increasing path weight , it can be stopped as soon as a pixel @xmath10 with @xmath45 is visited .    moreover , by the construction of the amoeba distance it is clear that the euclidean distance in the image domain is a lower bound for the amoeba distance between pixels .",
    "therefore the dijkstra algorithm for the start vertex @xmath9 can be run on the subgraph of @xmath46 that contains just the pixels from the euclidean @xmath41-neighbourhood of @xmath9 .",
    "even superficial inspection of results obtained by some amoeba filters indicates that they have striking similarities to image processing methods based on partial differential equations ( pdes ) .",
    "this observation has been substantiated in @xcite by studying space - continuous versions of amoeba filters ; the results proven there allow to interpret amoeba filters as time steps of explicit discretisations for suitable pdes .    to devise space - continuous versions of amoeba filters",
    ", one has to translate first the notion of amoeba metric to the space - continuous setting .",
    "once this is done , the definition of an amoeba as a @xmath41-ball around a reference point is straightforward .",
    "the amoeba metric for a space - continuous greyvalue image  a real - valued function @xmath4 over a connected compact image domain @xmath47  can be stated by assigning to each two given points @xmath48 as their distance the minimum of a path integral between @xmath49 and @xmath50 . just like the edge weights in the discrete amoeba construction , the integrand of the path integral is obtained by applying a suitable norm @xmath20 to the spatial metric ( the euclidean curve element of the path ) and the greyvalue metric ( the standard metric on the real domain ) , such that the amoeba distance reads as @xmath51 where @xmath52 runs over all regular curves @xmath53\\to\\varomega$ ] with @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath20 can be chosen as in the discrete case .",

    "then we see that the amoeba distance @xmath59 between two points @xmath60 , @xmath61 in the image domain @xmath62 can be interpreted as a distance @xmath63 on @xmath56 .",

    "force term_. its typical form is @xmath190 , i.e.essentially the right - hand side of a hamilton - jacobi pde for dilation or erosion , compare .",
    "an erosion force accelerates the inward motion of the contour ; it allows to get past homogeneous areas faster , and helps the contour to find concave object boundaries and to separate multiple objects . by a dilation force it is possible to push the contour evolution in outward direction , which makes it possible to use initial contours inside objects .    in both cases",
    ", however , the force strength needs careful adjustment because dilation or erosion may also push the contour evolution across object boundaries , thereby preventing their detection .    in @xcite where this modification was proposed first ( by the name of `` balloon force '' )",

    "the relation between amoeba quantile filters and hamilton - jacobi pdes mentioned in section  [ subsec : dilero ] indicates how to achieve a similar modification in the amoeba active contour algorithm : the median filter step should be biased , basically by replacing the median with some quantile .",

    "indeed , as demonstrated by an experiment in @xcite , the result of a numerical computation of a self - snakes evolution differs significantly if the underlying grid resolution is changed .",
    "a common remedy to this ill - posed behaviour is to use pre - smoothing in the argument of the edge - stopping function , i.e.  to replace @xmath214 in or by @xmath215 where @xmath216 is the result of convolving @xmath83 with a gaussian of standard deviation @xmath217 .",

    "amoeba filtering by construction already involves a very similar smoothing - scale parameter , namely , the amoeba radius @xmath41 .",

    "test cases are derived by adding small single - frequency oscillations such as @xmath220 with frequency vectors @xmath221 .    given the nonlinear nature of the filters under investigation , there is no superposition property for the effects of different perturbations of @xmath222 .",

    "from the results reviewed in this paper it can be seen that morphological amoebas provide a powerful framework for adaptive image filtering with interesting cross - relations to other classes of filters .",
    "they can also be applied fruitfully to related tasks such as image segmentation . combining amoeba procedures with ideas from quantitative graph theory",
    "even allows to construct a new class of texture descriptors .    at the same time",
    ", there remain many questions for future research .",
    "so far , the amoeba framework introduces adaptivity into local image filters solely by modifying the first step of the filter procedure , i.e.  the selection stage . the aggregation step like median , maximum , or",
    "minimum is left unchanged .",
    "could further improvements of adaptivity be achieved by envisioning also image - dependent modifications to the aggregation step ?",
    "how do modifications of selection and aggregation step interact ?",
    "no amoeba filter for multi - channel ( such as colour ) images have been studied in the present paper . in principle , there is little to prevent one from applying amoeba procedures to multi - channel data .",
    "the amoeba computation step generalises straightforwardly .",
    "there are also generalisations of median filters @xcite and supremum / infimum operations to multi - channel data @xcite at hand .",
    "the theoretical understanding of multi - channel amoeba filters , however , lags behind that in the single - channel case .",
    "a result in @xcite indicates that the median ",
    "pde relation even in its non - adaptive form , see proposition  [ prop : imfpde ] , has no equally simple multi - channel counterpart , thus leaving little hope to derive manageable pde equivalents of multi - channel amoeba filters .",
    "new approaches to a deeper understanding of the properties of multi - channel amoeba filters will have to be sought .",
    "the field of texture analysis addressed in section  [ sec : texture ] still is at an early stage of research .",
    "ongoing research is directed at extending the experimental evaluation of the newly introduced amoeba - graph texture descriptors for texture discrimination to a broader body of data .",
    "another goal is the selection of a powerful set of a few amoeba - graph descriptors with a high combined discrimination rate across multiple textures .",
    "tuning of the parameters of the descriptors has not been studied extensively so far and will therefore be addressed in the future .",
    "attempts are also underway to analyse the effect of the amoeba - graph descriptors theoretically .    in the field of texture segmentation the combination of amoeba - graph descriptors with other segmentation frameworks than the gac considered in section  [ subsec : texseg ] will be investigated .",
    "an integration with an amoeba active contour procedure could lead to a texture segmentation framework that uses the same sort of theoretically founded procedure for both texture feature extraction and the actual segmentation step . in many existing approaches , and also in the preliminary example from section  [ subsec : texseg ] ,",
    "these two steps are based on rather unrelated approaches . with regard to the graph - theoretical roots of the texture",
    "features under consideration , also graph - cut approaches for the segmentation stage could be a candidate for further investigation ."
