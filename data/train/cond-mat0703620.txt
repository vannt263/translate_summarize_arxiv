    "quantum melting ( the melting of a crystal induced by quantum fluctuations ) can be very different from a classical melting ( induced by temperature ) . in two dimensional electronic systems",
    ", it was found that near the melting point  @xcite , the system is neither in a liquid nor in a solid phase but shares properties with both phases .",
    "@xcite in bosonic systems , such an intermediate phase ( `` supersolid '' between the solid and the superfluid phase ) was proposed many years ago .",
    "@xcite the supersolid phase can be thought as a condensate of either static or dynamical defects .",
    "@xcite some supersolid behaviour ( i.e. existence of a non zero superfluid fraction in a solid system ) has indeed been recently observed  @xcite in helium 4 , creating a large renew of interest on both theoretical and experimental sides .",
    "the situation in helium 4 is however controversial as ( i ) uptodate quantum monte - carlo simulations do not find any superfluid fraction in the solid phase@xcite while providing very precise predictions in the superfluid and the solid phase , ( ii ) the experiments seem to be sensitive to the way the solid is prepared  @xcite ( an annealing of the supersolid kills or enhances the superfluid fraction depending on the experiments ) indicating that disorder probably plays a key role in this physics and ( iii ) one gets only access experimentally to macroscopic quantities which make it difficult to infer the physical mechanisms actually involved .",
    "an alternative bosonic system is now promising due to recent progresses in the field of ultracold gases .",
    "the production and observation of heteronuclear alkali molecules  @xcite at ultralow temperatures has been reached with various dimers , _",
    "e.g. _ krb  @xcite , rbcs  @xcite or lics  @xcite , yet not in their true molecular ground state .",
    "polar molecules confined in a two - dimensional trap with a perpendicular electric field could be given an important dipole moment ( on the order of @xmath0 debye  @xcite ) leading to strong repulsive dipole - dipole interaction on the plane .",
    "although these interactions are not trully long range in @xmath1d , the potential range is larger than for typical van der waals interaction and smaller densities are necessary to observe crystallization .",
    "moreover the true repulsive character of dipole - dipole interaction should strongly inhibit inelastic three - body recombination .",
    "such systems could be very good candidates for the study of quantum melting as they do not share the usual limitations found in helium 4 : there is a complete control of the external potential seen by molecules ( no disorder ) and many direct observations can been done ( of the spatial distribution of the density for the solid , of the condensate fraction for the superfluid part ) .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to study this potential use of cold dipolar gases in some detail .",
    "we note that two papers with a similar topic and some overlapping results appeared recently  @xcite and hence , whenever appropriate we will compare our findings with these works .",
    "another possible experimental realization of the model studied in this paper are electron - hole heterostructure bilayers where the excitons also interact through dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "@xcite    after introducing the model ( bosons in two dimensions with a dipole - dipole repulsion ) , and briefly the numerical technique ( green function monte - carlo or gfmc ) in section  [ sec : model ] , we proceed with the description of the high density limit where the crystal is expected . in section  [ sec : phonons ] we calculate the phonon spectrum of the crystal , from which we extract the high density expansion of the energy of the system .",
    "the nature ( first order ) of the transition is then discussed in section  [ sec : nature ] using the gfmc technique .",
    "particular attention is paid to the sensitivity of the results to the trial wave - function used in the calculation .",
    "the quality of the wave - function is usually measured in term of the distance in energy to the true ground state .",
    "we find that a better measure can be done by calculating the overlap of the trial wave - function with the true ground - state  @xcite . in section  [ sec : supersolid ] , we discuss the possibility of the existence of a supersolid in this system . in the last section  [ sec : conclusions ] ,",
    "we estimate the regime of parameters that should be accessible experimentally .",
    "the appendix contains the ewald summation technique that is applied to the dipole - dipole interaction to reduce finite size effects .",
    "our system is made of @xmath2 bosons of mass @xmath3 confined in two dimensions which interact through a dipole - dipole interaction of strength @xmath4 , so that the hamiltonian reads @xmath5 with dipoles polarized perpendicular to the plane .",
    "measuring lengths in unit of the average distance @xmath6 between bosons ( defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the @xmath1d density ) , and the energies in unit of @xmath9 , the rescaled hamiltonian depends on a unique dimensionless parameter @xmath10 and reads , @xmath11 the parameter @xmath10 ( named in analogy with electronic systems ) roughly measures the ratio between interaction energy @xmath12 and kinetic energy @xmath13 and reads , @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",

    "the ground state properties of the hamiltonian eq .   can be conveniently studied using quantum monte - carlo techniques which for a bosonic system ( in contrast to fermionic systems where one has to deal with the so called sign problem ) provides access to the exact ground state @xmath16 of the system .",
    "the idea behind this method is to project an initial ( variational ) guiding wave function @xmath17 ( gwf ) on the exact ground state @xmath16 by applying the projection operator @xmath18 . for large projecting time @xmath19 ,",

    ", @xmath17 not only enters as the starting point but also through the way the hilbert space is sampled when the projection operator is applied .",
    "a good choice of the trial wave - function is therefore important to get a good signal to noise ratio . in principle",
    "however ( i.e. for infinite computing time ) , the results should be independent of @xmath17 .    although this technique can be used for continuum systems , our particular implementation ( which has been described in ref .  )",
    "relies on the discretization of the hamiltonian on a grid ( which in returns allows us to work without discretizing the imaginary time @xmath19 ) . for some calculations ,",
    "we have also used the recently introduced reptation quantum monte carlo algorithm ( rqmc )  @xcite .",
    "rqmc is formally equivalent to gfmc and is its path integral counter part . for the regimes discussed in this paper , we found however that rqmc gave no real advantage over gfmc .",
    "unless explicitly stated we use only pure estimators ( forward walking technique  @xcite ) for the quantum averages .      the bosonic system is put on a rectangular grid of @xmath20 sites with nearest neighbor hopping .",
    "finite size effects are considerably reduced by repeating periodically the simulation box on the two - dimensional plane .",
    "this amounts to use periodic boundary conditions for hopping and to replace the dipole interaction by an effective two - body interaction that includes all periodic images .",

    "we use here a bijl - jastrow form : @xmath33 which includes at the variational level one - body and two - body correlations .",
    "two - body correlations are essential in the homogeneous ( bec ) limit where it dominates the physics and determines the shape of the wavefunction . on the contrary ,",
    "one - body terms are sufficient to describe the crystal limit where atoms are almost frozen .",

    "moreover it conserves the symmetrization property imposed by bosonic statistics in contrast with the gaussian form often considered in the literature .",
