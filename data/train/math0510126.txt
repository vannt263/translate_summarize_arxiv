    "<S> tropical geometry is used to develop a new approach to the theory of discriminants and resultants in the sense of gelfand , kapranov and zelevinsky . </S>",
    "<S> the tropical @xmath0-discriminant is the tropicalization of the dual variety of the projective toric variety given by an integer matrix  @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this tropical algebraic variety is shown to coincide with the minkowski sum of the row space of @xmath0 and the tropicalization of the kernel of  @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to an explicit positive formula for all the extreme monomials of any @xmath0-discriminant . </S>"
