    "<S> we have made a high resolution study of the specularity of the atomic reflection from an evanescent wave mirror using velocity selective raman transitions . we have observed a double structure in the velocity distribution after reflection : a peak consistent with specular reflection and a diffuse reflection pedestal , whose contribution decreases rapidly with increasing detuning . </S>",
    "<S> the diffuse reflection is due to two distinct effects : spontaneous emission in the evanescent wave and a roughness in the evanescent wave potential whose amplitude is smaller than the de broglie wavelength of the reflected atoms .    </S>",
    "<S> atomic mirrors are key components in the growing field of atom optics , and have been intensively studied by several groups in recent years  @xcite . for interferometric and lithographic applications , it is particularly important to ensure that the reflection at the mirror is specular , since diffuse scattering amounts to a loss of spatial coherence and consequently to a reduction of fringe visibility or focusing sharpness . </S>",
    "<S> thus much interest has been devoted to measuring and improving the roughness of atomic mirrors , using static or time dependent magnetic fields  @xcite , evanescent waves  @xcite or other techniques  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> most of the above mentioned experiments consisted in preparing an initial narrow velocity distribution , transverse to the direction of incidence , and measuring the broadening of this distribution due to the reflection . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the mirror was characterized by a single quantity , the rms increase in the width of the velocity distribution attributable to the mirror . </S>",
    "<S> this increase was sometimes also given in terms of an effective rms angular deviation from a perfectly flat surface . in those experiments </S>",
    "<S> however , the resolution only allowed a measurement of the broadening of the atomic velocity distribution due the mirror . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present an experiment using velocity selective stimulated raman transitions to prepare a very narrow initial velocity distribution  @xcite , and to measure the distribution after reflection . for the first time we are able to resolve a final velocity distribution </S>",
    "<S> which is not merely broadened , but qualitatively modified upon reflection .    </S>",
    "<S> much in analogy with the reflection of light from an optical mirror , we observe a double structure , with a narrow peak and a broad pedestal . </S>",
    "<S> the narrow peak corresponds to specularly reflected atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the broad pedestal corresponds to diffuse atomic reflection which has two origins : spontaneous emission and mirror roughness . </S>",
    "<S> if we assume that the roughness of the mirror can be viewed as a random process with variance @xmath0 and a correlation length much shorter than the mirror itself , one readily finds  @xcite that the fraction @xmath1 of specularly reflected atoms is given by @xmath2 , reminiscent of the debye - waller factor , with @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the de broglie wavelength of the incident matter wave ( 8 nm in our experiment ) . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a significant specular peak implies an effective mirror roughness smaller than @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> we have studied the ratio of these two components as a function of various parameters and shown in particular that the diffuse component rapidly decreases when the atomic evanescent wave detuning increases . </S>",
    "<S> these observations also allow us to examine different possible mechanisms for the diffuse reflection involving either mirror roughness or spontaneous emission .    </S>",
    "<S> in our experiment we use an evanescent wave mirror , identical to the one described in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we use a superpolished prism of tafd30 glass ( refractive index @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the rms surface roughness given by the manufacturer is @xmath6  nm . the input and output faces for the laser beam which creates the evanescent wave are coated with a broadband ar reflection coating . </S>",
    "<S> a ti : s laser of wavelength @xmath7  nm generates the evanescent wave with an incident angle @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> the evanescent electric field thus has a decay constant of @xmath9 , and a propagation vector of magnitude @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we have defined the @xmath11-axis to be along the evanescent wave propagation direction . </S>",
    "<S> the ti : s laser is tm ( p ) polarized and its waist is about @xmath12  mm along the @xmath11 and @xmath13-axes at the surface of the prism .    our @xmath14rb magneto - optical trap ( mot ) is similar to that described in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> every @xmath15  s , we collect about @xmath16 atoms in the trap . by turning off the repumping beam just before ( after ) the trapping beams , we prepare the atoms in the @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) level . the mot is situated @xmath19  mm above the prism .    </S>",
    "<S> velocity selective raman transitions between @xmath20 and @xmath21 hyperfine levels are induced by a pair of counter - propagating laser beams detuned from the one photon atomic resonance by about 1 ghz ( @xmath22 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.disporaman ] )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> because of the doppler effect , the resonance condition for a two photon raman transition depends on the atomic velocity and is given by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the detuning of the raman beams from the hyperfine transition , @xmath25 is the projection of the atomic velocity on the raman beam direction , and @xmath26 is the one photon recoil velocity of rb , 6 mm / s . by varying the detuning @xmath27 , we can choose the center of the velocity class that experiences a transition .    </S>",
    "<S> the two raman beams are orthogonally linearly polarized and drive the magnetic field independent raman transition between @xmath28 denoted @xmath29 and @xmath30  mg magnetic field oriented along the beam propagation direction lifts the degeneracy of the zeeman levels in the @xmath20 and @xmath21 manifolds . </S>",
    "<S> atoms which are not in the @xmath31 state are out of raman resonance and make no transitions . </S>",
    "<S> the raman beams propagate at @xmath32 with respect to the evanescent wave propagation vector in the @xmath33-plane . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore necessary to rotate the magnetic field adiabatically while the atoms fall to the mirror in order that they be in an eigenstate of the polarization ( nearly circular ) of the evanescent wave . </S>",
    "<S> after reflection the magnetic field is turned back to coincide with the propagation direction of the raman beams .    to generate the raman beams ( separated by @xmath34  ghz ) , we modulate the injection current of a free running diode laser at @xmath15  ghz and inject the @xmath35 sidebands into two slave laser diodes ( each diode is injected by one sideband ) . before injection , the laser beam passes through a fabry - perot cavity of @xmath36  ghz spectral range , a finesse of @xmath37 , and locked to the two sideband wavelengths to filter out the carrier wavelength and the @xmath38 sidebands . </S>",
    "<S> after injection , each raman beam passes through an acousto - optic modulator ( aom ) . </S>",
    "<S> an arbitrary function generator modulates these aoms to produce blackman pulses  @xcite of the desired duration . </S>",
    "<S> observation of the beat note between the two slave laser beams indicates a relative frequency spread less than @xmath19  hz ( equal to the resolution bandwidth of the spectrum analyser ) sufficiently narrow that the raman transition width is not limited by the raman phase coherence .    to test our setup </S>",
    "<S> , we first make a velocity selection and immediately analyse it with a second raman pulse . at @xmath39 , we prepare the atoms in the @xmath21 state . at @xmath40  </S>",
    "<S> ms we apply a raman @xmath41 pulse with a detuning @xmath42 to transfer atoms to @xmath29 . then comes a pushing beam resonant with the @xmath43 transition which removes all the atoms remaining in @xmath21 . at @xmath44  ms we apply a second raman  analysis \" @xmath41 pulse with a detuning @xmath45 to transfer atoms back to @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the atoms in the @xmath21 level are detected via the fluorescence induced by a retroreflected probe laser resonant with the @xmath47 transition and collected in a @xmath48  sr solid angle on a photomultiplier tube . </S>",
    "<S> no repumper is present in order to avoid detection of atoms in the @xmath20 level .    </S>",
    "<S> we repeat the sequence with a different value of @xmath45 in order to acquire the transverse velocity distribution of incident atoms ( figure  [ fig.specularite](a ) ) . the half width at @xmath49 of the distribution is @xmath50  khz . </S>",
    "<S> this width is consistent with what is expected for a @xmath51  @xmath52s blackman pulse . </S>",
    "<S> the curve demonstrates a velocity selection width for a single pulse of @xmath53  @xmath26 ( hw at @xmath54 ) along the propagation direction of the raman beams . </S>",
    "<S> this is about @xmath19 times narrower than the velocity width in the mot . because the analysis sequence has the same resolution as the selection sequence , our velocity resolution is @xmath55 times larger , that is @xmath56  @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> this resolution is @xmath36 times better than what was used in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    to observe the effect of the reflection on the transverse velocity , we proceed in a manner analogous to that described above ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.disporaman ] ) . at @xmath39 </S>",
    "<S> we prepare the atoms in the @xmath20 level . </S>",
    "<S> the raman selection pulse transfers a narrow velocity class to @xmath46 at @xmath40  ms . </S>",
    "<S> the atoms then fall onto the mirror . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency of the evanescent wave is tuned to the blue of the @xmath21 resonance to the excited state of the @xmath57 line , and to the red of the @xmath20 resonance . </S>",
    "<S> atoms in @xmath20 do therefore not reflect from the mirror . </S>",
    "<S> after reflection ( @xmath58  ms ) , the analysis pulse transfers some atoms back into @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> next the pushing beam removes the atoms remaining in the @xmath21 level and finally we detect the atoms transferred to @xmath29 with the probe laser and the repumper .    </S>",
    "<S> atoms which have not been selected by the first raman selection pulse can contribute to a background if they happen to be pumped into the @xmath46 state ( by the evanescent wave , for example ) during their trajectory . </S>",
    "<S> we measure this background using the same sequence described just above with the selection detuning @xmath42 tuned far from resonance . in our data </S>",
    "<S> acquisition we alternate between normal and background measurements and subtract the background on each shot . </S>",
    "<S> the detuning of the analysis pulse @xmath45 is scanned randomly over the desired values , and we acquire and average about @xmath36 measurements for each value of @xmath45 to acquire a spectrum such as that shown in fig .  [ fig.specularite](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the peak value in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.specularite](b ) corresponds to about @xmath59 atoms detected per bounce . </S>",
    "<S> typical values of the background in this case correspond to about @xmath60 atoms . despite this subtraction , </S>",
    "<S> we observe a non - zero background in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.specularite ] and [ fig.fit ] . </S>",
    "<S> this background appears to be due to atoms which reflect from the mirror but are pumped into the @xmath20 state after reflection .    with this system </S>",
    "<S> , we first checked that the atoms obey the law of reflection , that is the reflected angle is equal to the incident one . </S>",
    "<S> we vary the mean velocity of the initial distribution by choosing an appropriate @xmath61 , and verify that the center of the reflected velocity distribution varies by the same amount . we have noted a non - zero intercept of this linear dependence which we attribute to a slight tilt ( about @xmath62 ) in the mirror relative to the horizontal .    for </S>",
    "<S> a reflection to be regarded as truly specular , the velocity distribution must remain unchanged after reflection . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig.specularite](b ) shows the velocity distribution ( the number of atoms detected in the @xmath20 state after the raman analysis pulse ) after the bounce . </S>",
    "<S> one distinguishes a narrow peak whose width appears identical to the initial one , and a broad pedestal whose center is shifted by 7.9 khz , an amount corresponding to a @xmath63 momentum transfer with respect to the narrow one along the observation direction . </S>",
    "<S> this transfer is in the same direction as the evanescent wave propagation vector , and remains so when the evanescent wave ( ti : s ) laser direction is reversed ( that is it also reverses ) .    in an attempt to understand the origin of the pedestal , we acquired several reflected velocity distributions under differing conditions ; two examples are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.fit ] . </S>",
    "<S> each such distribution is fitted to a sum of two gaussians plus a flat background . </S>",
    "<S> we first examined the parameters of the pedestal as a function of the evanescent wave detuning @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> we observed little variation of the width and the shift relative to the narrow peak . to simplify the study of the relative contribution of the two components </S>",
    "<S> , we fixed the width of the narrow peak at the measured width of the resolution function . </S>",
    "<S> we also fixed the width of the pedestal and the shift at the average values of our preliminary fits : the pedestal width was fixed to be that of the convolution of our resolution function and a gaussian of 18 khz rms and the shift to be 7.9 khz . using this analysis we can measure the fraction @xmath1 of atoms detected in the narrow peak as a function of @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.loidechelle ] . ) </S>",
    "<S> the data are well fit by @xmath66 with @xmath67  ghz .    </S>",
    "<S> the above detuning dependence immediately suggests spontaneous emission within the evanescent wave which reduces the numbre of specluarly reflected atoms by a factor of @xmath68 . a simple estimate of @xmath69 , the average number of spontaneous emissions , is given by @xmath70 , where @xmath71  mhz is the natural linewidth of the atomic transition  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a better estimate includes the modification of the potential due to the van der waals interaction  @xcite , the modification of the spontaneous emission rate close to the surface  @xcite , and an average of these effects over the mirror surface . </S>",
    "<S> we find , in our range of detunings , that @xmath69 still varies as @xmath72 to a good approximation but with a probability about 1.5 times higher . to calculate @xmath1 one must also take into account the fact that at large detunings the branching ratio for falling back into the @xmath73 state , the only one which we detect , is 2/3 . </S>",
    "<S> this factor cancels the increase in @xmath69 due to the effects of the dielectric surface . </S>",
    "<S> one predicts therefore @xmath74 with @xmath75  ghz . </S>",
    "<S> there appears to be too little spontaneous emission ( by a factor of 2 ) to entirely explain our results .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , spontaneous emission in the evanescent wave should result in an average momentum transfer of @xmath76 along @xmath11 , that is , a shift of the broad pedestal of @xmath77 along the raman beam direction instead of the @xmath63 that we observe . </S>",
    "<S> this observation confirms the above conclusion that spontaneous emission in the evanescent wave is only partly responsible for our observations . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to the study of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite which used a very small value of @xmath78 to get a large number of spontaneous emissions in the evanescent wave .    </S>",
    "<S> another mechanism which causes diffuse reflection is discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it involves scattered ti : s light which interferes with the evanescent wave . </S>",
    "<S> the interference produces a rough potential which diffusely scatters the atoms . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism does _ not _ involve spontaneous emission . </S>",
    "<S> the scattered light could come either from the surface roughness , inhomogeneities in the bulk of the prism or some other object such as a prism edge . using the results in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite one can show that the propagating modes of the scattered light would cause @xmath1 to vary as @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> where @xmath80 depends on the amount of scattered light . </S>",
    "<S> the pedestal due to this effect should exhibit no shift relative to the specular peak . since spontaneous emission is responsible for about one half the pedestal </S>",
    "<S> , we expect a pedestal shifted by about one half of the shift due to spontaneous emission alone in good agreement with our observations . since both effects have the same @xmath81 dependence the observed shift should not depend on the detuning .    </S>",
    "<S> another possible explanation for the pedestal is spontaneous emission induced by the stray light above the prism while the atoms fall towards the mirror . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , in experiments in which we left the evanescent wave laser on for @xmath82  ms while the atoms fell towards the mirror , we observed an optical pumping of the atoms from their initial hyperfine state ( f=3 ) to the other hyperfine state ( f=2 ) ( about @xmath83 of the atoms were lost in this way at @xmath84  mhz ) . </S>",
    "<S> this mechanism predicts that @xmath1 should vary as @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is a constant which depends on the mean light intensity experienced by the atoms . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig.loidechelle ] the data are not consistent with this dependence .    </S>",
    "<S> thus we believe that we have identified the source of the diffuse reflection in our experiment as the sum the effects of the scattering of atoms from a potential induced by the random interference pattern of the evanescent wave and stray light , and spontaneous emission in the evanescent wave . according to this interpretation we have @xmath87 and we can work out the effective mirror roughness associated with @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath88  nm , a value much larger than the prism s measured surface roughness ( 0.07 nm ) . since the effective mirror roughness due to light scattering by the prism surface is of the order of the surface roughness itself  @xcite , we presume that most of the stray light is from other sources .    </S>",
    "<S> we turn now to an analysis of the narrow peak . </S>",
    "<S> since the area under the broad peak can be reduced by increasing the detuning @xmath65 , the essential question is `` how faithfully is the initial velocity distribution reproduced in the narrow peak ? '' . to characterize this effect </S>",
    "<S> , we compare the width of the narrow peak to that of the resolution function ( atomic experimental velocity distribution before the bounce ) for 36 runs acquired at different values of @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> we now fit the experimental curves by a sum of two gaussians with all parameters adjustable except for the width and center of the broad peak . averaging over 36 measurements , we find @xmath89 , where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the half widths at @xmath92 of the two curves after the bounce , and the uncertainty is the standard deviation of the weighted mean of our 36 measurements . </S>",
    "<S> a negative sign in the result is not necessarily unphysical because it could be due for example , to a slightly concave reflecting surface which collimates the atoms . </S>",
    "<S> we do not consider this deviation from zero to be statistically significant , however . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the observed reflection is consistent with a specular reflection to within about @xmath93 . </S>",
    "<S> our limit is a factor of 10 better than our previous best result @xcite .    to compare our results with those of refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and  @xcite , we calculate the rms angular deviation of an effective reflecting surface from perfectly plane : @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the incident atomic velocity on the mirror and @xmath96 is the rms transverse velocity added by the mirror . using the upper limit @xmath97 , we find that the effective mirror surface is flat to within uncertainty of @xmath98  mrad .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , we conclude that at sufficiently large detunings , it is possible to produce a highly specular mirror for atomic de broglie waves . </S>",
    "<S> by analogy with photon optics , the double structure we observe suggests that we are in the regime where the roughness of the atomic mirror is small compared to the wavelength of the reflected matter wave . in that regime </S>",
    "<S> , the specular peak corresponds to a `` perfectly '' coherent reflection , and it should be possible to test this property in an atom interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> interferometric experimental studies are in progress . </S>"
