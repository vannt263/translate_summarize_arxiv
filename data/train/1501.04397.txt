    "a neutron star ( ns ) is born as a result of the core collapse supernova explosion if the initial mass of the main sequence star is around 8 to 20 solar mass ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "various eos , relations between the density and the pressure , are used to describe the interior of neutron stars .",
    "the resulting central density of a neutron star is expected to reach up to several times of the nuclear saturation density ( @xmath4 @xmath5 ) .",
    "hence , a neutron star is one of the best astrophysical laboratories to study the physics of the extremely dense nuclear matter .",
    "figure [ fig : ns_section ] shows the structure of neutron stars in the theoretical point of view . outside the envelope , there exists a very thin atmosphere which is composed of hydrogen and heavy elements @xcite . depending on the temperature , its thickness ranges from a few centimeters to a few millimeters and the thermal radiation is expected to occur in this region .",
    "the envelope plays a role as a thermal insulator @xcite bewteen the outer crust and the atmosphere . in the outer crust ,",
    "heavy nuclei exist with free gas of electrons , and the bcc ( body centered cubic ) structure of nuclei is expected . as the density increases , neutrons drip out of heavy nuclei and can exist as free gas in the inner crust .",
    "the neutron @xmath6 superfluidity can also exist in the inner crust . in the boundary of the outer core and the inner crust",
    ", nuclear pasta phase may appear due to the nature of coulomb interaction @xcite , which favours a special geometrical shape to reduce the free energy . above half of the nuclear saturation density uniform nuclear matter exists .",
    "outer and inner cores occupy roughly 70 % of neutron star s volume . in the outer core",
    "the uniform nuclear matter can exist and neutron @xmath7 and proton @xmath8 superfluidities are expected . in the inner core exotic states with new degrees of freedom , such as kaons , hyperons , and deconfined quarks might appear .",
    "however , the inner structure of neutron star is still unknown due to the theoretical uncertainties , especially at the densities far beyond the nucleon saturation density .",
    "the mass distributions of observed neutron stars are summarized in table 1 of lattimer @xcite .",
    "note that the mass distribution of ns - ns binaries has very sharp peaks since the error bars of mass measurements are relatively small , and the well measured neutron stars in ns - ns binaries have masses @xmath9 . on the other hand , @xmath10",
    "neutron stars have been observed in ns - wd ( white dwarf ) binaries .",
    "this implies that the mass distribution may depend on the binary evolution in addition to the neutron star equation of states @xcite .",
    "recent observations of @xmath11 neutron stars ruled out many soft equations of states with which the maximum mass of neutron star becomes less than @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "another constraint on the nuclear equation of state comes from the x - ray binary observations and their analysis @xcite .",
    "mass distribution in x - ray binaries is very broad without sharp peak indicating that the uncertainties in the mass estimations are very large .    in table",
    "[ tab : nsobs ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : obsns ] , we plot the surface temperatures ( @xmath13 ) and photon luminosities ( @xmath14 ) of 18 observed neutron stars .",
    "note that three different models are used to estimate the effective surface temperatures of neutron stars at infinity .",
    "for black body ( bb ) model , the photon luminosity @xmath15 and the effective surface temperature @xmath16 of a neutron star at infinity are related by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the radius seen by an observer at infinity and @xmath19 is the stefan - boltzmann constant . we can determine @xmath18 by inserting @xmath13 and @xmath14 in the table  [ tab : nsobs ] into eq .",
    "( [ eq : lt ] ) . in recent works",
    "@xcite , we have investigated the behavior of nuclear eos at high densities by calculating the mass and radius of neutron stars with several skyrme force models .",
    "we could confirm that the models that satisfy the large mass observation @xcite are consistent with the mass - radius zone in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the conclusion does nt change even if we include exotic degrees of freedom such as kaon condensation @xcite or hyperons @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "nuclear eos is one of the key ingredients that determine the thermal evolution of neutron stars .",
    "available nuclear models predict very diverse mass - radius relations , so it is well expected that the cooling behavior will be sensitive to nuclear models .",
    "therefore , cooling of neutron stars provides a multi - test ground for the nuclear models ; whether a model good for mass - radius relation is consistent with the observed temperature data or not .    in this work ,",
    "we simulate the cooling curve of neutron stars with various eos obtained from both relativistic and non - relativistic models . without the superfluidity effect , the direct urca process is a good indicator whether a specific nuclear model is suitable for neutron star cooling simulation .",
    "if the temperature drop is too fast even for the low mass neutron stars ( @xmath20 @xmath3 ) , such eos is not consistent with most of the neutron star temperature observations . even though the existence of superfluidity highly suppresses neutrino emissivity , once the direct urca process is turned on before the critical temperature",
    ", the superfluidity can not slow down the temperature drop so that the temperature of neutron stars is much below any observational data.thus , the study of cooling curve of neutron star can provide hints about the inner structure of neutron stars and the eos of dense nuclear matter .",
    "in addition to the nuclear eos , physical conditions such as the composition of elements in the envelope , and existence of superfluidity in the core play crucial roles in determining the cooling curve of neutorn stars . in general",
    ", chemical composition of the envelope seldom affects the cooling mechanism , but the surface temperature depends sensitively on whether the elements in the envelope are light or heavy . on the other hand ,",
    "superfluidity directly determines the cooling rate .",
    "if nucleons form a cooper pair and transit to a superfluidic state , the rate of neutrino emissivity is suppressed exponentially .",
    "this may lead to a very slow cooling rate .",
    "however , below a critical temperature , creation and destruction of cooper pairs ignite a fast cooling mechanism , and this can give an abrupt decrease of temperature .",
    "recent literature succeeds to reproduce the cooling curve of cas a in terms of pbf @xcite . in this work , we incorporate pbf to various nuclear models and explore the extent to which the models can reconcile with pbf .    the structure of the paper is as follow . in section [ sec : eos ] we summarize the equation of state of nuclear matter which we used in the study of thermal evolution of neutron stars . in this work",
    ", we do not consider exotic matter or quark matter in the core of neutron stars but assume that the core is composed of nucleons ( protons and neutrons ) and leptons ( electrons and muons ) in the form of uniform matter . in section  [ sec : cool ] we present the basic equations for neutron star cooling .",
    "simple critical temperature formula is proposed and we analyze the pairing effects to neutron star cooling . in section  [ sec : stancool ] , we present the cooling curves for the standard cooling in which superfluidity is neglected with various nuclear models . in section  [ sec : super ] , we discuss the effect of the superfluidity to the cooling process . in section [ sec : con ] , we give conclusions from neutron star cooling curves combined with varios eos . in appendix , we summarize numerical methods to solve the diffusion equations for the thermal evolution of neutron stars .      .thermal emission from isolated neutron stars .",
    "temperatures were obtained using three different models ; hydrogen atmosphere ( ha ) , magnetized hydrogen atmosphere ( mha ) , and black - body ( bb ) model . for sources with no .",
    "2 @xmath21 7 , two different models were used to link the effective temperature and the photon luminosity .",
    "sources with no .",
    "16 @xmath21 17 have the limited observational data , thus have only one limit . + [ cols=\"^,<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in fig .",
    "[ fig : time_step ] , we compare results from three different numerical methods . if the superfluidity happens , penta - diagonal method needs a smaller size of time step to make the result similar with the ones from both the tri - diagonal methods ( even @xmath22 and odd @xmath23 ) and the tri - diagonal methods in which @xmath22 and @xmath23 are defined in all grid points .",
