    "a number of publications have proposed that biological tissue can be heated quickly and selectively by the use of gold nanoparticles ( gnps ) that are subjected to a strong time - harmonic electromagnetic field , mostly at 13.56@xmath1 where the band is chosen due to regulations , see _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "the hope is to find a non - invasive method to treat cancer .",
    "the gnps can also be used as a contrast agent for electrical impedance tomography , particularly when combined with tumour targeting @xcite .",
    "the basic idea is to exploit the unique property of the cancer cells to attract the gnps .",
    "the rapid rate of growth of the cancer cells causes them to intake an abnormal amount of nutrients and the gnps can hence be coated with folic acid to target the bio - markers or antigens that are highly specific to the cancer cells , see _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "the aim of the radio frequency ( rf ) treatment is then to cause local cell death only in the cancer , which in principle could be done at a moderate temperature of about 40 to 46 @xmath2c , in addition to increasing the pore size to improve delivery of large - molecule chemotherapeutic and immunotherapeutic agents .",
    "the physical background of the rf - heating does not seem to be fully understood and there are many phenomenological hypotheses proposed to explain the heating @xcite .",
    "recently , it has also been questioned whether metal nanoparticles can be heated in radio frequency at all , see _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite .",
    "below we comment on some key experiments and observations published in @xcite . in @xcite , a small amount ( some 10@xmath3 by mass ) of gold is added to a 1.5@xmath4 container with deionized water .",
    "a strong time - varying field is applied , and the heating rate is observed to increase by factors of ten .",
    "it is proposed that the increased heating is due to resistive ( joule ) heating and that the particle conductivity plays an important role .",
    "a plausible explanation to this phenomenon based on classical ion transport does not seem to be provided .",
    "an argument is the nanoscale effect associated with the electron - surface scattering where the size of the particle can be much smaller than the mean free path of electrons in gold which is in the order of 50@xmath5 .",
    "it can then be argued that the conductivity follows a drude model where the phenomenological time ( or damping ) constant can be seen as the typical collision time for an electron . in small particles , it is suggested that the collisions are dominated by the boundary of the particle @xcite which will lead to collision times in the order of femtoseconds , and which obviously can have nothing to do with properties at a few tens of@xmath1 .",
    "in @xcite , gnps are injected in cancer cells and a time harmonic electric field is applied .",
    "increased heating and tissue destruction is observed .",
    "at the same time , there was not a significant difference in media temperatures comparing the rf - treated cells and the control cells ( no gnps ) .",
    "the interpretation is that a local heat release in the microenvironment of the cells can be sufficient to produce lethal injury to the targeted tissue .",
    "it is difficult to read out the typical volume fraction of the nanoparticles , but it can be expected to be very low . on the other hand , the key observation in @xcite implies that maybe the temperature can be very high locally , typically where the metal particles have clustered .",
    "this is suggested also by some microscopic photos in @xcite , where the gnps seem to have clustered inside the cell .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the rf - heating of gold nanoparticles is questioned and under debate .",
    "several authors have not been able to find theoretical nor experimental support that metal nanoparticles can be heated in radio frequency at all , see _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite . in @xcite mie scattering theory in the rayleigh limit of very small particles is used as an argument to support the ( negative ) experimental conclusions made in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the classical electromagnetic background to the generation of heat in a cluster of homogeneous , conductive nanoparticles that are immersed in a lossy medium . a quasi - electrostatic homogenization approach ( hashin - shtrikman coated spheres )",
    "is used to show that the effect of generating electric dipoles and the associated losses dissipated in the exterior medium can be disregarded . a quasi - magnetostatic analysis",
    "is then performed indicating that an inductive heating based on magnetic coupling may have the potential to significantly increase the heating locally provided that the supplied magnetic field can be made sufficiently strong at radio frequency . finally , we present a near field optimization approach to study the electromagnetic heating of conductive nanoparticles showing that when the exterior medium is modelled as salty water the skin effect in the bulk material will render the simple principle of inductive heating of gnps practically useless at @xmath0@xmath1 .",
    "future research issues are discussed in some detail , and we are particularly emphasizing the potential of exploiting the electrophoretic resonance effects that can be associated with a suspension of glutathione coated gnps , see _",

    "the analysis technique based on the hashin - shtrikman coated spheres that was used above can not be readily applied to analyze the case with inductive heating . as will be seen below ,",
    "the reason for this is simply the fact that the actual power loss in each coated sphere depends on its radius and it is hence difficult to assess the correct background heating when there are no spheres present .",

    "this is a realistic assumption since the nanoparticles can usually be processed to have almost equal size .",
    "we emphasize however that this analysis is simplified in the sense that we are assuming that the actual nanostructure is large enough to be considered periodic at the same time as it is small enough to justify that the skin effect can be neglected .",

    "however , it has been suggested that gold nanoparticles may exhibit magnetic properties @xcite , and the possibility to employ ferromagnetic nanoparticles must also be kept open @xcite .",
    "there are several mechanisms that have been proposed to account for magnetic losses such as brownian or viscous heating @xcite . in @xcite",
    "is also proposed that magnetism in the sub-10@xmath5 gnps can give a significant heating effect possibly in combination with the electrophoretic mechanisms which are due the movement of gnps with net charges .",

    "we have investigated the classical electromagnetic background to the generation of heat in a cluster of conductive nanoparticles that are immersed in a lossy medium .",
    "first , a quasi - electrostatic homogenization approach ( hashin - shtrikman coated spheres ) has been used to show that the effect of generating electric dipoles and the associated losses dissipated in the exterior medium can be disregarded , unless the volume fraction of the gnps is unrealistically high or if there are some other electric dipole mechanisms present ( such as _ e.g. _ , with nanospheres coated with ligands and associated electrophoretic mechanisms ) which are not taken into account here .",
    "a quasi - magnetostatic analysis has then been performed indicating that an inductive heating ( induced eddy currents inside the metal particles ) based on magnetic coupling may have the potential to significantly increase the heating locally provided that the supplied magnetic field can be made sufficiently strong at radio frequency .",
    "finally , a near field optimization approach has been presented to study the electromagentic heating of conductive nanoparticles showing that when the exterior medium is modelled as salty water the skin effect in the bulk material will render the simple principle of inductive heating of gnps practically useless at @xmath0@xmath1 .",
    "future research will therefore be focused on an investigation of plausible dispersion mechanisms associated with gnps coated with ligands and which can potentially generate significant absorption based on the electrophoretic ( plasmonic ) resonance effects .",
