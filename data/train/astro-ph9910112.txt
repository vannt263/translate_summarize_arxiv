    "a sub - class of post - agb objects display in their ir spectrum an emission feature at 21@xmath0 m , first identified on iras lrs spectra by kwok et al .",
    "it was realised that the feature only occurs in spectra of c - rich post - agb stars as evidenced by the presence of pah - emission in the mid - ir spectra and often strong hcn measurements .",
    "the carrier(s ) of the 21@xmath0 m feature is ( are ) still unidentified .",
    "its excitation and/or formation is limited to a short evolutionary phase since the feature is not observed in ir spectra of agb stars nor in those of planetary nebulae ( e.g. kwok et al .",
    "1999 ; volk et al .",
    "the carbon rich nature of the circumstellar environment of these objects was corroborated by the detection of c@xmath1 , c@xmath2 and cn bands in the optical spectra ( hrivnak 1995 ) .",
    "detailed analysis of high - resolution spectra of these bands indicates that they are formed in a relatively narrow shell in the circumstellar envelope ( bakker et al . 1996 ; 1997 ) .",
    "several studies of the photospheric composition confirmed the post-3rd dredge - up character of individual 21@xmath0 m  stars : they do not only display a high photospheric c / o ratio but also a large overabundance of s - process elements ( van winckel 1999 and references therein ) .",
    "the colour - temperature of the ir - excess , the high luminosity and actual spectral type together with the chemical composition of both the photosphere and circumstellar material are all observational evidence that the 21@xmath0 m  stars are _ post - carbon stars_.    although in recent years the efforts and results on the theoretical modelling of the structural and chemical evolutionary agb models are impressive ( see e.g. straniero et al . 1995 ; frost & lattanzio 1996 ; herwig et al . , 1997 ;",
    "mowlavi et al . 1998 ; mowlavi 1999 ; langer et al .",
    "1999 ) the calculations are not only dependent on fundamental parameters like initial mass and metallicity , but also on much less constrained or even free parameters like mass - loss history and geometry , details of the dredge - up phenomena and thermal pulse nucleosynthesis , numerical treatment of convection , interpulse phase at which the post - agb phase starts , engulfed proton profile into the intershell , etc .",
    "there is now general agreement that the neutrons , needed for the s - process nucleosynthesis in agb stars , are mainly produced by the @xmath3c(@xmath4,n)@xmath5o reaction with a possible contribution from the minor activation of the reaction @xmath6ne(@xmath4,n)@xmath7 mg ( e.g. smith & lambert 1986 ; jorissen & arnould 1989 ; busso et al .",
    "1992 ; gallino et al .",
    "1998 ; mowlavi et al .",
    "the @xmath3c available from the cno hydrogen burning is insufficient to explain observed s - process abundances ( e.g. mowlavi et al .",
    "1998 ) so one has to invoke a primary source of @xmath3c .",
    "this @xmath3c pocket is naturally build up after engulfment of free protons into the @xmath8c - rich intershell .",
    "the engulfed proton profile is , however , still a free parameter in the predictions .",
    "straniero et al .",
    "( 1995 ) proposed that the s - process synthesis occurs during the intershell in a radiative environment and they computed that the neutron irradiation varies within the radiative intershell depending on the engulfed proton profile .    the observational data guiding the theoretical chemical evolutionary models come from the analysis of intrinsic agb stars of the m - ms - s - sc - c star sequence , ( e.g. lambert et al .",
    "1995 and references therein ) which is thought to reflect , at least partly , the evolution on the agb of single stars towards an increasing c / o ratio .",
    "in addition , the enrichment in @xmath8c seems to correlate well with an increase in s - process abundances ( e.g smith & lambert 1990 ) .",
    "the study of the abundance distribution of different s - process elements is therefore a very useful tool to characterise the internal nucleosynthesis during and in between thermal pulses and to confine models of chemical evolution on the agb .",
    "the strong molecular opacity and sometimes unstable photospheres of agb stars make a quantitative analysis , however , difficult and some species even untraceable .",
    "a second group of objects with excess abundances of s - process elements is the ba - stargroup .",
    "in the rest of the paper we use the ba - stargroup as a generic term for all objects for which the excess is acquired by mass - transfer from the companion which is now a white dwarf .",
    "it includes strong and mild ba giants and ba dwarfs , ch giant and subgiants , extrinsic s stars and since recently also yellow symbiotics ( e.g. review by jorissen 1999 ) .",
    "the characteristics of the s - process excesses in these stars reflect the internal chemical enrichment of the companion , and the abundances may have been diluted by mixing of unprocessed material during the evolution of the gainer .",
    "the s - type stars in this group are normally labeled extrinsic s - stars and are characterised by the lack of tc in their atmospheres ( e.g. jorissen et al .",
    "1993 ) or their lower luminosity than intrinsic agb s - stars ( van eck et al .",
    "1998 ) .    in this paper , we analyse another group of intrinsic s - process enriched objects , namely the 21@xmath0 m stars . with their f to g spectral types ,",
    "a wide variety of chemical species can be studied quantitatively by using photospheric atomic lines .",
    "this makes them ideal complementary sources to constrain the 3rd dredge - up nucleosynthesis and dredge - up models .    the chemical composition of individual 21@xmath0 m objects is already reported in the literature ( klochkova 1995 ; zas et al .",
    "1995 ; van winckel et al . 1996a",
    "; reddy et al . 1997 ; decin et al . 1998 , klochkova et al .",
    "1999 ) . since the different authors use different line - lists , spectral resolution and atomic data , it is often difficult to compare the results quantitatively .",
    "we therefore present in this paper a homogeneous chemical study of a sample of 21@xmath0 m  objects using the same spectral resolution , line - lists and atomic data for all 6 programme stars .",
    "we focus specifically on the different s - process elements and the integrated neutron irradiation . in sect .",
    "2 we give an overview on the data obtained and sketch the reduction method , while the details of the chemical analysis are given in sect .",
    "3 . in sect .",
    "4 a synopsis of our abundance analysis is presented proving that the 21@xmath0 m  stars show clear chemical evidence for their post - agb character . sect . 5",
    "is devoted to the discussion of the results of the individual objects and in sect .",
    "6 we focus on the heavy - element nucleosynthesis and the determination of the neutron exposure . our findings on the post - agb stars are then compared in sect .",
    "7 to the s - process abundances displayed in intrinsic agb stars and extrinsic heavy - element enriched objects with a wide range in metallicity .",
    "we end with formulating the main conclusions in sect .",
    "in table  [ tab : program ] we list the sample of 21@xmath0 m stars discussed here together with the spectral domain observed and signal - to - noise obtained .",
    "most spectra were obtained using the utrecht echelle spectrograph ( ues ) mounted on the 4.2 m william hershel telescope ( wht ) on la palma , spain .",
    "we used the echelle with 31.6 lines / mm and the projected slit width was 1.1  on the sky yielding a resolution of around r = @xmath9/@xmath10@xmath9 @xmath11 50 000 ) depending on the wavelength .    [ cols= \"",
    "< , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     the connection between @xmath12 and [ hs / ls ] is clear .",
    "note also that for the stars with a low [ hs / ls ] the minimum of @xmath13 and so the neutron exposure @xmath12 is well defined . for stars with a higher [ hs / ls ] , a larger range of values for @xmath12 are possible : a high neutron exposure will only raise the overall level of enhancement without significantly changing the distribution of the individual abundances ( see also fig .",
    "[ overabundance ] ) .",
    "therefore , the s - process distribution of iras05341  fits well for every @xmath14 .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfehsls ] the [ hs / ls ] index from the 21@xmath0 m stars is shown in comparison with the overall s - process enrichment as parameterised by the [ s / fe]-index .",
    "more objects should clearly be studied , but the total neutron exposure is surprisingly strongly correlated with the total enrichment of s - process elements in the 21@xmath0 m stars , with more enriched objects showing also a stronger total neutron irradiation !",
    "a simple linear least - squares fit gives a high correlation coefficient of + 0.96 with the fit    @xmath15 = 0.76 [ \\mathrm{s}/\\mathrm{fe } ] - 1.21\\ ] ]    since the asymptotic distribution of s - process elements is probably reached in carbon stars ( busso et al .",
    "1995 ) , the [ hs / ls ] index will not change with increasing dredge - up of enriched material in the stellar envelope , making the [ hs / ls ] index independent of the dilution factor of the enriched material by the initial stellar envelope material . the [ hs / ls ] correlation with [ s / fe ] therefore reflects a different and more efficient internal nucleosynthesis , with increasing dredge - up efficiency ! in agb evolutionary models , the inclusion of protons into the intershell will create a primary @xmath3c pocket and induce the neutron production .",
    "[ fig : sfehsls ] indicates therefore that , with increasing dredge - up efficiency , also the dredge - in of protons will increase , giving rise to a higher neutron irradiation .",
    "although our sample at this point only consists of 6 objects , a considerable spread in metallicity ranging from @xmath160.3 to @xmath161.0 is observed .",
    "since the @xmath3c(@xmath4,n)@xmath5o neutron source in agb stars is most likely of primary origin the [ hs / ls ] index should increase with decreasing metallicity due to the larger amount of neutrons per iron seed nucleus ( e.g. clayton 1988 ) .",
    "this assumes , however , that the diffusion of protons into the c - rich layer itself is independent of metallicity or on parameters linked to the metallicity ( like temperature profile , luminosity etc . ) .",
    "a higher neutron exposure is therefore expected for low metallicity objects _ assuming _ that the thermal pulse phenomenon itself is independent of metallicity .    in fig .",
    "[ fehslsa ] we display the [ hs / ls]-index in function of the metallicity .",
    "the 21@xmath0 m stars clearly cover a wide range in neutron irradiation in the range of the observed iron abundances with indeed a inverse dependence of the [ hs / ls ] ratio on metallicity .",
    "the correlation is , however , broad with a large intrinsic spread ( the simple correlation coefficient is @xmath160.67 ) .",
    "the most metal deficient object iras07134  has seem to have undergone a much smaller neutron irradiation than the less metal deficient iras05341 .",
    "clearly , also other stellar parameters determine the internal agb nucleosynthesis during the agb evolution .",
    "note that the two stars significantly below the least - square line are the ones for which we detected the very heavy element hf ( z=72 ) .",
    "if indeed these high abundances turn out to be true , this would indicate that the s - process is able to produce elements heavier than the ba peak and thus probably up to the lead - peak !",
    "if true , the low [ hs / ls]-index of the two stars might be due to the production of very heavy elements .",
    "it is clear that high s / n blue spectra of all the objects are needed for a more detailed discussion .",
    "moreover , several ( probably single ) post - agb objects are known which do not show s - process enrichment nor enhanced c / o ratios .",
    "these objects include hd161796 ( [ fe / h]=@xmath160.3 ; luck et al . , 1990 ) , hd133656 ( [ fe / h]= @xmath161.0 ; van winckel et al . 1996b ) and sao239853 ( [ fe / h]= @xmath160.8 , van winckel 1997 ) which show very similar metallicities and ir - excesses .",
    "unfortunately , like the 21@xmath0 m objects they are too far for reliable hipparcos parallaxes so the luminosity differences between the enriched and non - enriched objects is an as yet unknown but probable key parameter in this discussion .",
    "in this section we compare our results on 21@xmath0 m sources with the observational data on the intrinsic agb stars of the m - ms - s - mc - c sequence . for ms and s stars we used results from the series of papers by smith & lambert ( 1985,1986,1990 ) and smith et al .",
    "( 1987 ) : since the spectra of oxygen rich agb stars are dominated by strong tio - bands , only a few spectral windows can be used to infer abundances from atomic lines .",
    "the regions in between 740 and 758 nm , and 998 to 1010 nm , were used together with additional ir spectra around 1.6 , 2.2 and 4.0 @xmath0 m to deduce abundances of cno isotopes .",
    "the situation is even worse for c stars where the c@xmath1 and cn bands dominate the optical and ir spectrum . to our knowledge",
    "only utsumi ( 1985 and references therein ) made a quantitative analysis of the s - process enhancement in c stars using two small spectral windows with minimal molecular absorption ( 475490 nm , and 440450 nm ) .",
    "sc stars , on the other hand , are agb stars with a c / o ratio close to 1.0 making the oxide bands and bands from carbon molecules very weak or absent so that many atomic lines become detectable in the spectrum .",
    "we use the results for seven sc stars from a recent paper by abia & wallerstein ( 1998 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ overabundance ] we compare the observed overabundances of the light s - process elements ( [ ls / fe ] ) with the ones observed in intrinsic agb stars . since there is strong observational evidence that the 21@xmath0 m stars are post - carbon stars , it is no surprise that the overabundances of the s - process elements in 21@xmath0 m stars are indeed large in comparison with ms , intrinsic s and sc stars and are comparable with and on average even slightly higher than observed in c stars .",
    "we therefore can confirm earlier results that the increasing c / o ratio in the ms - s - sc - c sequence is also reflected in an increasing enhancement of s - process elements ( e.g. smith & lambert 1990 ; abia & wallerstein 1998 ) .",
    "to investigate the metallicity dependence of the integrated neutron exposure for intrinsic agb stars is not easy since the metallicity of field carbon stars is very difficult to determine and the spread in metallicities observed in galactic m - ms - s - sc stars is not large ( e.g. smith & lambert 1990 ) .",
    "plez et al .",
    "( 1993 ) have shown , however , that seven intrinsic agb stars in the metal poor ( [ fe / h ] = @xmath160.5 ) small magellanic cloud do indeed show a very high neutron exposure and they suggest that it is not intrinsic to the smc but due to the low initial metallicity .",
    "the metallicity spread observed in the extrinsic enriched objects is much larger and there is growing observational evidence that the [ hs / ls ] index is indeed anti - correlated with metallicity ( e.g. smith 1999 ) : busso et al .",
    "( 1995 ) confirmed earlier suggestions by luck & bond ( 1991 ) in a compilation of literature values of the [ hs / ls ] index in ba stars and ms - s stars and quantified tentatively the metallicity dependence of the neutron irradiation as an increase in [ hs / ls ] of about 0.2 dex for a metallicity drop from 0 to @xmath160.5 .",
    "strong support came also from the work by vanture ( 1992 ) who has shown that the neutron irradiation is high in the metal - poor ch giants , thus enlarging the metallicity spread to lower metallicities .",
    "north et al . ( 1994 ) also found that the [ hs / ls ] index was correlated with the metallicity in a sample of ch - subgiants .",
    "finally also the low metallicity yellow symbiotics , who recently were included in the ba - star family , show s - process distributions characterised by a relatively high neutron irradiation ( smith et al . 1996 , 1997 ; pereira et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the results obtained by luck & bond ( 1991 ) included , however , 4 metal deficient objects with small overabundances showing a very weak neutron irradiation .",
    "they dubbed these stars `` the metal - deficient ba stars '' .",
    "some caution should be expressed by generalising these results to single star agb evolution : especially for the short orbital period binaries there is strong evidence that the binarity affects the mass - loss and thus the agb evolution itself of these binaries .",
    "the amount of thermal pulses and the characteristics of the s - process synthesis might therefore also be affected by the orbital elements ( e.g. jorissen & mayor 1988 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fehslsb ] we compare the [ hs / ls ] index in function of the metallicity with the values found in the literature for other s - process enriched objects .",
    "this compilation is difficult since the definition of the hs and ls indices is author - dependent .",
    "we scaled the abundances to the definition given in section 4.4 .",
    "for undetermined abundances of the ch giants , we used the tables of malaney ( 1987 ) with a @xmath17 of 1.0 mbarn@xmath18 which is more appropriate for those objects , while for the others we used 0.4 mbarn@xmath18 tables .",
    "we discarded objects for which less than 4 abundances of the in total 7 elements ( sr , y , zr , ba , la , nd and sm ) were available .",
    "[ fehslsb ] shows that there is a large spread in the integrated neutron irradiation , but that there is indeed a global increase with decreasing metallicities from [ fe / h ] @xmath11 @xmath160.5 downwards as already noted by several authors ( e.g. smith , 1999 ) .",
    "three out of four `` metal - deficient ba stars '' show a very low [ hs / ls]-index ( luck @xmath19 bond , 1991 ) .",
    "these stars certainly are worth a re - analysis based on higher resolution , higher signal - to - noise spectra since the internal errors of the analysis based on photographic intermediate resolution ( 0.2  ) spectra are rather large and the observed overabundances small ( luck & bond , 1991 ) .",
    "some ch - stars show extremely high [ hs / ls]-indices for their metallicity but also some ba stars like the very nd - rich hd35155 ( not in the figure ) show a - typical values .",
    "the 21@xmath0 m post - agb objects follow the same trend as the ch - subgiants of the same metallicity and show on average a somewhat lower [ hs / ls]-index compared to the ba giants .",
    "we can conclude that the metallicity dependence of the neutron exposure has a large _ intrinsic _ spread which confirms that certainly also other fundamental parameters determine the internal nucleosynthesis and dredge - up phenomena during the agb evolution .",
    "we presented a homogeneous study of abundances displayed by a sample of carbon - rich 21@xmath0 m post - agb stars . with their low metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ranging from @xmath160.3 to @xmath161.0 ) , high c / o ratio ( ranging from 1.0 to 2.9 ) and especially their high photospheric abundance of s - process elements",
    ", we confirm that they are post-3rd - dredge - up objects . since also the circumstellar environment is c - rich and no orbital motion",
    "is observed we can classify the 21@xmath0 m stars as single post - carbon stars of low initial mass .",
    "f spectral type makes that a wide variety of s - process elements can be detected by their atomic lines .",
    "this , together with their significant spread in metallicity , make that the 21@xmath0 m stars are ideal objects to constrain the agb nucleosynthesis and dredge - up models .",
    "the most interesting constraint in this context comes from the possibility to accurately determine a wide variety of elemental abundances of these intrisically enriched objects .",
    "contrary to agb stars themselves , no photospheric molecular absorption is observed , so isotopic ratios of key elements are in the 21@xmath0 m stars unfortunately difficult to determine . the molecular bands originating in the circumstellar environment can , however , be used for some isotopes like @xmath8c and @xmath3c ( e.g. bakker & lambert 1998a ) .      *",
    "the 21@xmath0 m stars display a wealth of atomic lines from s - process elements .",
    "the photospheric spectrum of stars like iras05341  is even completely dominated by atomic lines of heavy elements .",
    "the observed overabundances of s - process elements in the analysed 21@xmath0 m stars are large and range from [ ls / fe ] = @xmath201.3 to @xmath201.9 which make the 21@xmath0 m stars among the most s - process enriched objects known . *",
    "the 21@xmath0 m stars display a wide variety of integrated neutron irradiation as parameterised by the observational [ hs / ls]-index , corresponding to a @xmath17 neutron exposure from @xmath17 = 0.2 to 0.8 mbarn@xmath18 . *",
    "the [ hs / ls ] index displayed by the 21@xmath0 m stars is strongly correlated ( classical correlation coefficient of + 0.96 ) with the total enrichment of the s - process elements as parameterised by the [ s / fe]-index , in the sense that more enriched objects also display a higher integrated neutron irradiation . since in carbon stars",
    "the asymptotic values of the s - process distribution is probably reached , this means that the dredge - up efficiency is strongly linked with the neutron production in the intershell ! * the anti correlation of the [ hs / ls ] index with the metallicity of the 21@xmath0 m objects is less well determined ( classical correlation coefficient @xmath160.67 ) and contains a large scatter .",
    "this scatter is certainly intrinsic and confirms that also other fundamental parameters determine the internal nucleosynthesis and dredge - up phenomena during the agb evolution .",
    "note that the 21@xmath0 m  stars are the only intrinsically enriched objects for which a wide range in metallicity is observed . *",
    "compared with other s - process enriched objects of extrinsic nature , the neutron exposure displayed by the 21@xmath0mstars fall roughly in the same range as the ch subgiants and is on average lower than it is in ba - giants of the same metallicity .",
    "note that the metallicity dependence of the neutron exposure displayed by intrinsic and extrinsic objects contains also a large intrinsic scatter .",
    "especially the iron deficient ba stars as defined by luck & bond ( 1991 ) should be analysed in great detail since they display a very low neutron irradiation for their low metallicity .",
    "we can conclude that a homogeneous detailed study of the 21@xmath0 m  stars forms a very useful complement to other types of s - process enriched objects ( intrinsic agb stars and extrinsic enriched objects ) used in the observational study of the theoretically less well understood s - process nucleosynthesis , mass - loss and dredge - up phenomena occurring on the agb .",

    "<S> we present in this paper a homogeneous photospheric abundance study , on the basis of the analysis of high resolution optical spectra , of six post - agb objects displaying a 21@xmath0 m circumstellar dust feature in their ir spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> the f - g spectral type of the 21@xmath0 m stars make that a large range of elements including a wide variety of s - process elements , can be studied by their atomic lines . </S>",
    "<S> the high c / o - ratios together with the large overabundance of s - process elements prove that the objects are descendants of field carbon stars . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss in detail the s - process abundance distribution displayed by these 21@xmath0 m stars and conclude that the 3rd dredge - up efficiency is closely related to the strength of the integrated neutron irradiation . </S>",
    "<S> the expected anti - correlation of the neutron irradiation with metallicity , on the other hand , contains a large _ intrinsic _ scatter . </S>",
    "<S> finally we compare our results with other intrinsic and extrinsic s - process enriched objects and conclude that the post - agb stars offer very useful complementary data to constrain the evolutionary models of agb nucleosynthesis and dredge - up processes . </S>"
