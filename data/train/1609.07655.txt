    "laser spectroscopy provides a detailed insight into atomic structure including all subtle effects that contribute to the exact energy and the splittings of individual energy levels .",
    "many of these effects are of great relevance in fundamental physics problems , as for example quantum electrodynamics , nuclear structure and weak interaction . nowadays ,",
    "laser spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations is an indispensable tool to explore many - body qed in weak and strong fields and the search for a time or spatial dependence of fundamental constants like the fine structure constant .",
    "it provides important information for the analysis of spectra from stars and quasars , for studies of the nuclear structure and for determining the weak charge of a nucleus .",
    "the technique we present here , has provided new data in two of the mentioned fields , namely the determination of nuclear charge radii and moments of beryllium isotopes @xcite and the test of many - body bound - state qed calculations in three - electron systems @xcite .",
    "it is based on collinear laser spectroscopy , a technique that has been contributing to these fields considerably and is one of the workhorses for investigations of nuclear spins and moments , which is witnessed by a long series of review papers @xcite over the last decades . in parallel , it has also been used to investigate the fine structure splittings in helium - like ions as a test of bound - state qed .",
    "such tests were carried out using boron b@xmath7 @xcite , nitrogen n@xmath8 @xcite and fluorine f@xmath9 @xcite . in these experiments",
    "counter- and copropagating beams have been used to determine absolute frequencies , while for the spectroscopy of short - lived neon isotopes a similar approach was used to calibrate the acceleration voltage of the ions @xcite .    for the measurements on beryllium isotopes",
    "we have further developed this technique and combined it with a frequency comb to provide high - precision measurements of the transition frequencies .",
    "a photon - ion coincidence detection provided the sensitivity required for the detection of the 20-ms isotope @xmath10be .",
    "these investigations were motivated twofold , by the nuclear structure aspect and the possibility to provide an important benchmark for bound - state qed calculations in three - electron systems .    for nuclear structure physics",
    "the nuclear charge radius is an important observable .",
    "its change along a chain of isotopes is extracted with high precision from optical isotope shifts .",
    "this provides insight into differences of the radial distribution of protons and the underlying collective effects of soft or rigid deformation or cluster structures , which are often observed for the few - nucleon systems of light nuclei . only during the last decade new experimental techniques and precise atomic structure calculations for few - electron systems gave access to the determination of charge radii of low-@xmath11 nuclei ( @xmath12 ) with unprecedented precision . in 2000 , first calculations of the mass shift in three - electron systems @xcite provided sufficient accuracy to extract the very small finite nuclear size effect from high - precision isotope shift measurements . since then , calculational precision for three - electron systems has been improved by two orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "published first results for four - electron systems @xcite and recently even showed results that pave the way towards boron - like five - electron systems @xcite .",
    "laser spectroscopy experiments on helium and lithium isotopes were strongly motivated by the existence of so - called halo nuclei .",
    "these are nuclear systems with the last neutron(s ) being bound by only a few 100kev , compared to typical nuclear binding energies of the order of 57mev / nucleon . due to",
    "this weak binding , the neutrons are allowed to tunnel far away from the central core , having a large part of their wavefunctions beyond the classical interaction length of the strong force .",
    "these nuclei have been a hot topic in nuclear structure research since their discovery in 1983 @xcite .",
    "isotope shifts for such systems were measured previously in helium and lithium isotopes .",
    "single atoms of the short - lived two - neutron and four - neutron halo nuclei @xmath13he were confined in a magneto - optical trap and probed by laser light @xcite .",
    "the lithium isotopes including the two - neutron halo nucleus @xmath14li were investigated by applying two - photon resonance ionization spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the beryllium isotope chain contains the one - neutron halo nucleus @xmath14be and the isotope @xmath10be which in the traditional shell model should have a closed neutron shell .    with regard to atomic structure",
    ", the vast progress in nonrelativistic few - electron bound - state qed of has opened the possibility of additional tests of many - body qed of in these light systems .",
    "the helium fine structure was recently calculated up to the order @xmath15 and is now one of the most precise qed tests in two - electron systems @xcite .",
    "the extension of such calculations to three - electron systems proved to be much harder since the extension of the respective computational methods with explicitly correlated functions turned out to be considerably more difficult .",
    "only recently it became possible to perform a complete calculation of @xmath16 and @xmath17 contributions to the fine structure @xcite of a three - electron atom .",
    "on the experimental side , measurements of the @xmath6 fine structure splitting in light three - electron systems are limited in accuracy for isotopes with non - zero nuclear spin due to the unresolved hyperfine structure ( hfs ) in the @xmath18 level .",
    "this has been the reason for the fluctuating results on the fine structure splittings in lithium @xcite being reported for a long time .",
    "these turned out to be caused by quantum interference effects in the observation of the unresolved resonance lines @xcite .",
    "once this issue had been resolved experimentally , good agreement with ab initio calculations was obtained @xcite .",
    "since relativistic and qed contributions grow in size with increasing @xmath11 , it became important to study the fine structure splitting also in be@xmath3 to further test bound - state qed .",
    "both aspects have been addressed with the technique described in this paper . besides giving a detailed description of the experiment implemented at isolde ( cern ) , we will present an overview of the spectroscopic results obtained in two beamtimes ( called run i and run ii ) .",
    "compared with the techniques used to study helium and lithium isotopes , the collinear approach has the advantage of being more generally applicable and providing high - precision isotope shift data for short - lived isotopes of elements in the so - far inaccessible region @xmath19 .",

    "the field shift @xmath20 , also known as the finite nuclear size or nuclear volume effect , can then be extracted according to eq.([eq : is ] ) .",
    "the corresponding mass shifts @xmath21 as well as the field shift constant @xmath22 were theoretically evaluated to an accuracy that exceeds the experimental uncertainty by about an order of magnitude and are compiled in tab .",
    "[ tab : propis ] .",
    "we have been using the results from @xcite to calculate @xmath23 , which is then combined with the reference radius @xmath24  fm @xcite of @xmath5be to provide absolute charge radii along the chain using eq.([eq : absoluter ] ) .",
    "it should be noted that the uncertainty of @xmath25 is probably underestimated since c2 scattering from the quadrupole distribution has been omitted , which might change the radius by about 3% @xcite .",
    "the results are listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : isotopeshift ] .",
    "changes in the mean - square charge radii deduced from the isotope shifts in the d1- and d2-transition are of similar accuracy in case of even isotopes , while for odd - mass isotopes the unresolved hyperfine splitting in the d2 lines leads to larger uncertainties .",
    "figure  [ fig : be12radii ] depicts the development of the rms charge radius along the isotopic chain as extracted from the experiment ( @xmath26 ) by combining all available data .",
    "we have also included results from fermionic molecular dynamics ( fmd ) calculations @xcite that follow the observed trend quite closely , but the charge radii are generally somewhat too small .",
    "the two triangles shown for @xmath10be are results of two additional calculations performed under the assumption that the two outermost neutrons occupy either a pure @xmath27 state ( @xmath28 ) , as expected in the traditional shell model or a pure @xmath29 state ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "the latter is expected to contribute to the ground state only if the @xmath31 shell gap between the @xmath32-shell and the @xmath33-shell is significantly reduced .",
    "this prediction shows that the charge radius of @xmath10be is extremely sensitive to the admixture of @xmath33-shell states to the ground state , which was a strong motivation for the measurement of the @xmath10be isotope shift .",
    "be was determined from electron scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "the red bullets ( @xmath26 ) represent the experimental results with uncertainties dominated by the uncertainty of the reference charge radius of @xmath34be .",

    ", calculations were also performed forcing the neutrons into a @xmath27 and an @xmath29 orbit .",
    "the bottom row shows the structure of the isotopes interpreted in a cluster picture .",
    "for details see text . , title=\"fig : \" ]    the trend of the charge radii along the isotopic chain can be understood in a simplified picture based on the cluster structure of light nuclei @xcite .",
    "this is visualized in the small panels below the graph in fig.[fig : be12radii ] .",
    "@xmath36be can be thought of as a two - body cluster consisting of an @xmath37 particle and a helion ( pnp = @xmath38he ) nucleus that are bound together and exhibit a considerable center - of - mass motion .",
    "this motion blurs the proton distribution and leads to an increased charge radius .",
    "@xmath39be is missing since the two @xmath37 particles constituting this nucleus are not bound and the nucleus only exists as a resonance .",
    "the stable isotope @xmath5be , which has a @xmath40 structure , is more compact than @xmath36be because the @xmath37 particles themselves are very compact and well bound by the additional neutron .",
    "this effect is even enhanced with the second neutron added in @xmath35be . the sudden upward trend to @xmath14be is attributed to the one - neutron halo character of @xmath14be which can be disentangled into a @xmath35be core and a loosely bound neutron .",
    "this halo character not only increases the matter radius , but also affects the charge radius due to the center - of - mass motion of the core caused by the halo neutron .",
    "the fact that the charge radius of @xmath10be is even larger has been related to the fact that the two outermost neutrons exhibit a strongly mixed @xmath33 character rather than belonging to the @xmath32 shell as expected in the simplified shell - model picture .",
    "this mixture leads to an increased probability density outside the @xmath35be core , pulling the @xmath37 particle apart due to the attractive n@xmath37 interaction .",
    "theory predicts an @xmath29 admixture of about 70% for this nucleus , being a clear indication for the disappearance of the classical @xmath31 shell closure . for a more detailed discussion of the nuclear charge radii , the comparison with ab - initio microscopic nuclear structure calculations and the conclusions about the shell closure see refs.@xcite .",

    "only recently the fine structure splitting in three - electron atoms became calculable with high precision as demonstrated for the case of lithium @xcite .",
    "our result confirmed first calculations for the @xmath47 three - electron system of be@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the change in the fine structure splitting along the chain of isotopes provides a useful check of the so - called splitting isotope shift which can be calculated theoretically to very high accuracy , because the value is nearly independent of both qed and nuclear volume effects .",
    "this mass dependence is shown in fig.[fig : fs_sis ] : the blue data points represent the experimental fine structure splittings and the red line with red crosses the theoretically expected mass dependence based on the calculated splitting isotope shift and the measured splitting of @xmath5be .",
    "the excellent agreement between the theoretical curve and the experimental data can be interpreted as a reliable check of the consistency of the mass shift calculations . on the other hand ,",
    "it proves the consistency of the experimental data , because the fine structure splittings are based on the combination of absolute transition frequencies obtained independently in two beam times , even with independent optimization of the experimental conditions .",
    "the observation that the data points scatter much less than expected from their error bars can be ascribed to the fact that our systematic uncertainties largely cancel out in considering differential effects .",

    "this is clearly visible in fig.[fig : fs_sis ] where the error bars are smallest for these two cases . for these isotopes ,",
    "the fine structure splitting was determined sequentially in a short time interval and therefore the best cancellation of all systematic uncertainties should occur .",
    "indeed , the splitting isotope shift between the two isotopes @xmath48mhz agrees very well with the theoretical value of 3.203mhz . here",
    "the uncertainty of the experimental value is purely statistical assuming that all dominant systematic contributions are cancelled out .    with the confidence gained about the reliability of the theoretical estimates",
    ", we can combine the calculated splitting isotope shifts of all isotopes to extract an improved value for the fine structure splitting of @xmath5be . to this aim ,",

    "we believe that a small remaining systematic uncertainty of the fine structure splitting is still covered by the size of this uncertainty . in the right hand part of the figure , the theoretical prediction represented by the filled red triangle",
    "is compared with experiment .",
    "the calculated splitting in @xmath5be amounts to 197068.0(25)mhz , which is about 4.5mhz larger than the experimental value .",
    "this difference corresponds to about @xmath50 of the combined uncertainties .",
