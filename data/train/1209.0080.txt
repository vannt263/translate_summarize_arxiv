    "there is a renewed interest in the study of nuclear symmetry energy recently , as the next generation low - energy rare isotope accelerators are being constructed and planned worldwide  @xcite . understanding the details of the nuclear symmetry energy is intricately related to understanding a wide range of subjects ranging from rare isotopes to neutron rich nuclear matter such as the neutron star  @xcite .",
    "one of the main puzzle to be solved currently is the behavior of the nuclear symmetry energy at high density  @xcite .    from a phenomenological point of view",
    ", the nuclear symmetry energy can be obtained by looking at the nuclear binding energy within the semi - empirical mass formula in the limit of a large nucleon number  @xcite . there",
    ", the symmetry energy can be understood as originating from the energy difference between the proton and the neutron in isospin asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "hence , in this picture , the nuclear symmetry energy can be obtained from the nucleon optical potential or by calculating the energy of the nucleon quasi - particle near the fermi surfaces in asymmetric nuclear matter .    in the dirac phenomenology of nucleon - nucleus scattering  @xcite ,",
    "the optical potential of the nucleon is composed of a vector and scalar part , @xmath1 .",
    "it is well known that in order to fit the spin observable , one needs a strong scalar attraction ( re @xmath2 ) and a strong vector repulsion ( re @xmath3 ) both of several hundred mev , but such that the combined sum to the energy is only a few tens of mev , a result consistent with traditional low - energy nuclear physics .",
    "the strong scalar and vector potentials appear naturally in the relativistic mean - field theories ( rmft ) , where meson exchange interactions between nucleons on the fermi sea produces the strong scalar and vector potentials for the nucleons .",
    "but it was only after the works in qcd sum rules that the strong optical potentials were found to have a basis in qcd .",
    "the application of qcd sum rules @xcite to the nucleon in the vacuum was developed in ref .",
    "the first pioneering work of applying the qcd sum rule method to nucleons in medium was performed by drukarev and levin  @xcite . here",
    ", the operator product expansion ( ope ) was performed in the light cone direction where @xmath4 with their ratio finite , where @xmath5 are the external momenta and the medium four vector respectively .",
    "later , the relation became clearer through the work by cohen , furnstahl and griegel  @xcite , who showed that the strong scalar - vector self energy appearing in the quasi nucleon pole in the symmetric nuclear matter can be traced back to the scalar - vector quark condensate in the nuclear medium .",
    "the ope in this work was based on the short distance expansion , where @xmath6 , while @xmath7 is held fixed . for the medium at rest , this expansion is equivalent to taking the energy to be large and imaginary at a fixed finite three momentum  @xcite and , hence , the comparison to the self - energy obtained in the rmft approaches becomes more direct through the use of the energy dispersion relation .",
    "motivated by these results , and to express and elucidate the origin of nuclear symmetry energy directly from qcd , we have applied the qcd sum rule to calculate the neutron and proton energy in asymmetric nuclear matter . identifying the difference with appropriate factors to the nuclear symmetry energy ,",
    "we show that this energy can be expressed in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom .",
    "results based on the first formalism to calculate the nucleon mass in asymmetric matter using qcd sum rules were reported before  @xcite . but here , we will follow the second formalism adopted in ref .  @xcite .",
    "we have performed the ope up to dimension - six operators and have identified all the independent twist-4 operators .",
    "independent twist-4 operators and their relation to moments of structure functions appearing in deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) were identified before @xcite . in a later work by one of us @xcite ,",
    "the available experimental data on twist-4 effects were collected to constrain the independent matrix elements . using this information",
    ", we have calculated the leading density dependence on the nucleon sum rules coming from the twist-4 effects . from the qcd sum rule analysis , we find that the scalar ( vector ) self energy part gives a negative ( positive ) contribution to the nuclear symmetry energy , which is consistent with the results from relativistic mean - field theories .",
    "we find that an important contribution to the negative contribution of the scalar self - energy comes from the twist-4 matrix elements , whose higher - density behavior will determine the still - controversial property of the symmetry energy at these densities .",
    "our result also extends an early success of the qcd sum rule method in understanding the symmetric nuclear matter in terms of qcd operators to the asymmetric nuclear matter case .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we start with a brief review and a simple idea for the nuclear symmetry energy . in sec .",
    "iii , we develop the qcd sum rule formalism , and discuss the ope and its matrix elements .",
    "the results for the qcd sum rule analysis for the nucleons in asymmetric nuclear matter and the nuclear symmetry energy are presented in sec .",
    "finally , the conclusion is given in sec .",
    "we start from a finite nuclei with @xmath8 nucleons .",
    "the bethe - weizsker formula for the nuclear binding energy is given as @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "the fourth term accounts for the total shifted energy due to the neutron number excess . taking the infinite nuclear matter limit of this formula ,",
    "one notes that @xmath11 reduces to the nuclear symmetry energy  @xcite .    to derive the formula for @xmath11 that can be generalized to the infinite nuclear matter",
    ", we start from a simple formula for the total energy : @xmath12 where @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) is the average neutron ( proton ) quasi - particle energy in asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "now , the core of the model is what approximation goes into calculating the average energy .",
    "the symmetry energy in asymmetric nuclear matter is defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the nuclear medium density and @xmath17 and the neutron and proton densities are @xmath18 , @xmath19 respectively .",
    "therefore , in eq .  , the symmetry energy will have contributions from the term proportional to @xmath20 in @xmath21 and the term proportional to @xmath22 in @xmath23 .",
    "for a non interacting fermi gas of nucleons , each with mass @xmath24 , calculating the average nucleon energy will give @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the nucleon fermi energy .",
    "following the procedure described above and extracting the term proportional to @xmath22 gives a nuclear symmetry energy of @xmath27 .",
    "going back to finite nuclei , assuming a ` fermi well ' with constant energy difference @xmath28 between adjacent nucleon energy levels , the symmetry energy can be obtained from the second term of eq .  . that is ,",
    "using @xmath29 , we have , @xmath30    for the infinite nuclear matter case , we can calculate @xmath31 from @xmath32 and obtain the nuclear symmetry energy @xmath33 , as it appears in eq .",
    ", by collecting coefficients of @xmath22 in eq .  .",
    "@xmath33 can in general be decomposed into the kinetic like part and the potential like part in the mean field type quasi - particle approximation . the kinetic part of @xmath34 can be obtained from the formula given in ref .",
    "@xcite ; @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the fermi momentum and @xmath37 is the potential part of the quasi - nucleon self energy in a symmetric nuclear matter .      in the present qcd sum rule calculations",
    ", we will be using the linear density approximation , because the in - medium condensates in the qcd sum rule can be most reliably estimated to leading order in density .",
    "this means that for either the proton or the neutron , the mass will be given as follows : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the vacuum mass and @xmath40 are the constants to be determined later .",
    "we then have , @xmath41 combining eq .   with eq .",
    ", we obtain the symmetry energy .",
    "that is , @xmath42 $ ] , hence , @xmath43 which is similar to the relation given in eq .  .",
    "therefore , to this order , the symmetry energy comes only from the energy difference in the proton and neutron at the fermi surface in an asymmetric nuclear matter as given in eq .  .",
    "however , when operators have higher density dependence , the factors appearing in eq .   should be modified , and the symmetry energy will have contributions from both the sum and the difference of the nucleon energies .",
    "the quantity of interest , namely @xmath44 $ ] can be obtained by looking at the pole of the nucleon propagator in nuclear medium : @xmath45 \\vert\\psi_0\\rangle \\label{4},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the nuclear medium ground state , and @xmath47 is a nucleon field .",
    "a relativistic mean - field type of contribution will then appear in the self - energies .",
    "the nucleon propagator can be decomposed as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the four - velocity of the nuclear medium ground state  @xcite .",
    "the nucleon self energy can be decomposed similarly as  @xcite : @xmath50 where @xmath51 in the mean - field approximation @xmath52 and @xmath53 are real and momentum independent , and @xmath54 is negligible . hence , @xmath55    the phenomenological representation of the nucleon propagator can then be written as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is unity in this discussion .",
    "but if one includes the effect of @xmath54 , @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath59 and @xmath60 are the positive and negative energy poles , respectively , @xmath61 with fixed @xmath62 , @xmath63 depends only on @xmath64 .",
    "one can extract self energy near @xmath65 with analytic properties of the nucleon propagator .",
    "to express the self - energies in terms of qcd variables , we start with analyzing the correlation function via the operator product expansion ( ope ) . the correlator is defined as @xmath66\\vert\\psi_0\\rangle,\\label{corr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is an interpolating current of the nucleon and @xmath46 is the ground state of the asymmetric nuclear medium characterized by the rest frame medium density @xmath16 , the medium four - velocity @xmath49 and the asymmetry factor @xmath20 .",

    ", we set the nuclear medium at rest , which means @xmath72 , and keep @xmath73 fixed .",
    "@xmath74 then becomes a function of @xmath64 only , which means @xmath75 @xmath76 .",
    "as mentioned before , we will follow the formalism adopted in ref .",

    "their contribution to the spectral density will be given as in eq .",
    ", which will have the following contribution to the invariant functions : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the residue at the quasi - nucleon pole , which accounts for the coupling of the interpolating current to the quasi - nucleon excitation state , and the omitted parts are the contributions from the higher excitation states , which will be accounted for through the continuum contribution after the borel transformation .",
    "the even and odd parts of the invariant functions are respectively related to the following parts of the discontinuity : @xmath80 where we have defined the invariants with different superscripts from the following decomposition according the the parity in @xmath64 : @xmath81    the ope of the three invariants of both the even and odd parts can be expressed as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the ground state expectation value of the physical operator in the asymmetric nuclear medium ; @xmath84 .",
