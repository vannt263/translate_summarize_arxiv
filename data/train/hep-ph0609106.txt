    "the new cern cngs neutrino beam  @xcite , directed towards italy , has recently begun operation .",
    "first events have been collected in the opera detector  @xcite at lngs  @xcite .",
    "the goal of this first phase is to unambiguously detect the appearance of @xmath6 leptons induced by @xmath7 cc events , thereby proving the @xmath8 flavor oscillation .    the opera result ,",
    "together with well established observations of solar and atmospheric neutrinos , in particular from superkamiokande  @xcite , sno  @xcite and kamland  @xcite , will most likely confirm the validity of the @xmath9 pmns  @xcite mixing matrix approach to describe all the observed neutrino flavor conversion phenomena .",
    "however , in order to complete this picture , all the elements ( magnitude and phase ) of the mixing matrix must be determined . that includes the @xmath0 element for which today there is only an upper bound corresponding in the standard parameterization to @xmath10 ( 90%c.l . ) from the chooz  @xcite reactor experiment .",
    "the determination of this missing element is possible via the detection of @xmath1 oscillations at a baseline @xmath2 and energy @xmath3 given by the atmospheric observations , corresponding to a mass squared difference @xmath4 .",
    "the current optimization of the cngs beam provides limited sensitivity to this reaction and opera should reach a sensitivity @xmath11 ( 90%c.l . ) in 5 years of running .",
    "t600  @xcite , to be commissioned in the coming years , will detect too few contained cngs events to competitively study electron appearance .",
    "the t2k  @xcite and nova  @xcite accelerator projects are on the other hand optimized for searching for electron appearance and should reach a sensitivity @xmath12 ( 90%c.l . ) some time after 2010 .",
    "double - chooz  @xcite will also attempt to detect a small @xmath13 disappearance effect from reactors , aiming for a result before the two previous projects at accelerators .",
    "a non vanishing @xmath14 would open the possibility of cp / t violation in the leptonic sector , as a direct consequence of non - trivial complex phases in the @xmath9 mixing matrix . in the case of neutrino flavor oscillations , there is only one relevant phase in the mixing matrix , called @xmath15 .",
    "the condition @xmath16 would induce different flavor transition probabilities for neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "the observation of this effect is one of the main challenges of future neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "on the other hand , due to matter effects , neutrinos and antineutrinos propagate differently through the earth .",
    "this will also induce differences in oscillatory behaviors of neutrinos and antineutrinos that are rather small at the baseline considered here , however will affect the sensitivity of an unambiguous determination of the value of the mixing matrix complex phase .    in this document",
    "we discuss the physics potential beyond the approved opera programme , of an intensity upgraded and energy re - optimized cngs neutrino beam coupled to new off - axis detectors , and show that improvements in sensitivity to @xmath5 compared to that of t2k and nova are possible with a next generation large liquid argon tpc detector located at an appropriately chosen off - axis position . as location ,",
    "a `` green - field site '' , rather distant from lngs , presumably at shallow depth is envisaged  @xcite . in the green - field site",
    ", a dedicated shaft would be dug in the ground with a depth of about 200  m and a cavern capable of hosting the detector would be excavated at this depth . with such a facility ,",
    "the possibility to discover cp - violation and disentangle the mass hierarchy via matter effects is also addressed .",
    "the considered intensity enhancement of the cern sps has strong synergies with the upgrade / replacement of the elements of its injector chain ( linac , psb , ps ) and the refurbishing of its own elements , envisioned for an optimal and/or upgraded lhc luminosity programme .",
    "the cngs is a `` conventional '' neutrino beam , in which most neutrinos are produced by the decay of secondary pions / kaons obtained in high - energy collisions of protons on an appropriate target and followed by a magnetic focusing system . in this kind of beams , the neutrino spectrum and the flux",
    "are essentially determined by four parameters :    * the primary proton energy @xmath17 impinging on the target , * the number of protons on target @xmath18 per year , * the focusing system , which focuses a fraction of the secondary charged pions and kaons ( positive , negative or both signs depending on the focusing device ) , * the angle @xmath19 between the parent meson flight direction and the direction of the detector at the far distance .",
    "the current nominal proton intensity per cngs pulse is @xmath20 at 400  gev / c  .",
    "this number is only slightly below the intensity record achieved in the sps in 1997 after careful tuning of all the accelerator complex .",
    "since that time the cern ps and sps machines have had major upgrades in preparation for the lhc beam . in september 2004 a total intensity of @xmath21",
    "was accelerated to top energy in the sps . following the studies for the cngs , it was found that the rf acceleration of the sps could be shortened by 0.2  s , allowing to reduce the length of the cngs cycle from 6.2  s to 6.0  s , with a considerable positive impact for the possible protons on the cngs target , since the total cycle could be reduced from 7.2  s to 6.0  s.    in dedicated mode , the cngs should be able to deliver @xmath22 pots / year  @xcite .",
    "this is computed assuming @xmath23 , a cycle of 6 seconds , a running of 200  days and an efficiency of 55% , corresponding to a beam power of 0.3  mw .",
    "this is summarized in table  [ tab : accelerators ] .",
    "this situation is to be contrasted with the jparc or fnal facilities .    at jparc",
    "the baseline power is 0.75  mw  @xcite . using a design @xmath24 , a cycle of 3.64 seconds , a running of 130  days and an efficiency of 100% at 40  gev / c actually yields a beam power of 0.6  mw . starting in 2009",
    ", the beam power should be 0.1  mw and be ramped up to design intensity and beyond in the following years  @xcite .",
    "future upgrades of the jparc complex consider an increase of protons per pulse and a reduced cycling time , to bring up the power to 4  mw , although this is known to be a rather challenging goal .",

    "in addition , though , an `` off - axis '' detector records an additional contribution of low energy neutrinos from the decay of higher energy parents decaying at a finite angle .    considering only neutrinos produced by pion and kaon decays which are the dominant contributions to muon neutrinos or antineutrinos , the neutrino energy @xmath28 and decay angle @xmath19 with respect to the meson flight path are in the laboratory system simply correlated , because of the involved two - body decays of the type @xmath29 , where @xmath30 : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the lorentz boost of the parent meson , and @xmath33 is the maximum neutrino energy , i.e. @xmath34 for pions and @xmath35 for kaons .",
    "the neutrino energy @xmath28 is hence proportional to the pion energy for on - axis configuration ( @xmath36 ) . for off - axis configuration the derivative with respect to energy yields @xmath37 .",
    "hence , the derivative is positive for @xmath38 , it is zero when @xmath39 , and negative for @xmath40 .",
    "it tends to zero from below for @xmath41 .",
    "the possible neutrino energy reaches therefore a maximum value independent of the parent meson energy : for pions , @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , an additional attractive feature of the neutrino flux observed at the `` off - axis '' detector is a kinematical suppression of high energy neutrino component : detectors placed at different angles with respect to the neutrino beam direction are exposed to an intense narrow - band neutrino with the energy defined by the detector position , which produces a neutrino flux peak at an energy about 8 times higher than for pions .",
    "the relative intensity of the pion and kaon peaks scales with the ratio of @xmath43 production yields , which depends on the proton beam energy , and on the off - axis angle since the neutrinos produced in kaon decays are less forward peaked than those produced in pion decays . ] .    in the case of cngs ,",

    ", we consider the possibility to change the cngs optics .",
    "since in the off - axis configuration the neutrino energy is almost independent of the parent meson energy , it is better to move towards a focalization of lower energy pions which are more abundant , compared to the cngs @xmath6 optics which focalizes high energy pions around 35 and 50  gev / c .",
