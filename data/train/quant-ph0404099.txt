    "interference of electrons encircling a magnetostatic flux has been studied extensively since the work of aharonov and bohm @xcite .",
    "these ideas have been applied in various contexts , for example , in magnetoconductance oscillations in mesoscopic rings @xcite , `` which - path '' experiments @xcite , and neutron interferometry @xcite .",
    "the aharonov - bohm effect can be generalized by replacing the magnetostatic flux with an electromagnetic field .",
    "the objective in this `` ac aharonov - bohm '' effect is very different from the `` dc aharonov - bohm '' effect ( with magnetostatic flux ) . in the latter case",
    "the physical reality of the vector potential has been demonstrated and the subtleties of quantum mechanics in nontrivial topologies have been studied .",
    "the former case constitutes a nonlinear device , where the interaction between the interfering electrons and the photons leads to interesting nonlinear phenomena .",
    "indeed the nonlinearity can be seen in the intensity of the interfering electrons which is a sinusoidal function of the time - dependent magnetic flux . in refs . @xcite the interference of electric charges in the presence of both classical and nonclassical electromagnetic fields , has been studied .",
    "it has been shown that the quantum noise of the electromagnetic field affects the phase factor .    in this paper",
    "we consider two aharonov - bohm interference devices which are far from each other .",
    "each of them is irradiated with a nonclassical electromagnetic field .",
    "the aim of the paper is to consider entanglement between the two electromagnetic modes irradiating the two aharonov - bohm interference devices and study the correlations between the interfering electrons in the two devices .",
