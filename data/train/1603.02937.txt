    "let @xmath1 be a body ( the closure of a bounded open set ) in @xmath2 .",
    "we consider a potential of the form @xmath3 and investigate its spatial maximizer .",
    "when @xmath4 is given by the gauss kernel , the potential @xmath5 is the solution of the cauchy problem for the heat equation with initial datum @xmath6 , @xmath7 a spatial maximizer of @xmath8 is called a _ hot spot _ of @xmath1 at time @xmath9 .    in @xcite , chavel and karp showed that @xmath1 has a hot spot for each @xmath9 , that any hot spot belongs to the convex hull of @xmath1 , and that the set of hot spots converges to the one - point set of the centroid ( center of mass ) of @xmath1 as @xmath9 goes to infinity with respect to the hausdorff distance .",
    "furthermore , calculating the hessian of @xmath10 , in @xcite , jimbo and sakaguchi indicated that @xmath1 has a unique hot spot whenever @xmath11 . roughly speaking ,",
    "the large - time behavior of hot spots was studied in @xcite .",
    "( to tell the truth , in @xcite , the above properties of hot spots were shown for a non - zero non - negative bounded compactly supported initial datum .",
    "but , in this paper , we are interested in the case where the initial datum is given by the characteristic function of a body . )    in contrast , in @xcite , karp and peyerimhoff gave a geometric heat comparison criteria and investigated the small - time behavior of hot spots .",
    "roughly speaking , they compared two heat flows for two points in two different bodies by using the distance functions from the complements and showed that any sequence of hot spots of @xmath1 at time @xmath12 converges to an _ incenter _ of @xmath1 as @xmath12 tends to zero .",
    "let us review their exact statement as below : let @xmath13 and @xmath14 be bodies in @xmath2 ; fix two constants @xmath15 ; let @xmath16 , and @xmath17 ; then , we can choose a small time @xmath18 such that if @xmath19 , then , for any @xmath20 and @xmath21 , we have @xmath22 ; taking @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( the _ inradius _ ) , we can conclude that , for any decreasing sequence @xmath25 with zero limiting value and any hot spot @xmath26 of @xmath1 at time @xmath12 , the distance between @xmath26 and the set of incenters @xmath27 tends to zero as @xmath28 goes to infinity .",
    "( to tell the truth , they investigated the above comparison theorem in riemannian manifolds .",
    "but , in this paper , we are interested in euclidean case . )",
    "we also refer to @xcite for the small - time behavior of hot spots .    on the other hand , in @xcite ,",
    "for the kernel @xmath29 in , the author gave a sufficient condition implying the results shown in @xcite .",
    "as a by - product , for example , his sufficient condition can be applied to the _ poisson integral _ for the upper half space , @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the @xmath32-dimensional spherical lebesgue measure .",
    "precisely , his sufficient condition implies that the function @xmath33 has a maximizer for each @xmath34 , that any maximizer of @xmath35 belongs to the convex hull of @xmath1 , that the set of maximizers of @xmath35 converges to the one - point set of the centroid of @xmath1 as @xmath34 goes to infinity with respect to the hausdorff distance , and that @xmath35 has a unique maximizer whenever @xmath36 .    here",
    ", we remark that the poisson integral @xmath37 satisfies the laplace equation for the upper half space , that is , @xmath38 and we have the boundary condition @xmath39    in order to understand the geometric meaning of the author s results on maximizers of @xmath35 , let @xmath40 .",
    "the function @xmath41 is obtained in the following manner : let @xmath42 be a point in @xmath2 , and @xmath34 a positive constant ; define the map @xmath43 the _ solid angle _ of @xmath1 at @xmath44 is defined as the @xmath32-dimensional spherical lebesgue measure of the image @xmath45 ( see figure [ angle ] ) , and direct calculation shows @xmath46 in @xcite , the solid angle of @xmath1 as @xmath44 was regarded as the `` brightness '' of @xmath1 having a light source at @xmath44 .",
    "we call a maximizer of @xmath47 an _ illuminating center _ of @xmath1 of height @xmath34 .",
    "thus , the properties of @xmath37 shown in @xcite are understood as the large - height behavior of illuminating centers . in other words , it was shown that the large - parameter behavior of spatial maximizers of @xmath37 is similar to that of @xmath8 .    from such backgrounds , in this paper",
    ", in order to compare small - parameter behavior of spatial maximizers of @xmath37 and @xmath8 , we mainly investigate the small - height behavior of illuminating centers .",
    "informal computation shows @xmath48 as @xmath34 tends to @xmath49 .",
    "but the right hand side diverges whenever @xmath42 is in @xmath1 .",
    "then , for a point @xmath42 in the interior of @xmath1 , let us consider its _ hadamard finite part _ , @xmath50 here , we remark that the latter equality holds whenever @xmath51 ( see proposition [ without_limit ] ) .",
    "it is expected that any sequence of illuminating centers of height @xmath52 converges to a maximizer of @xmath53 as @xmath52 tends to zero .",
    "this expectation comes from the following procedure : let @xmath54 be small enough ; suppose that , for any small enough @xmath55 , any illuminating center is at least @xmath56 away from the boundary of @xmath1 ; since the poisson kernel is radially symmetric , the solid angle of @xmath57 at @xmath44 depends only on @xmath56 and @xmath34 ; decomposing the solid angle function as @xmath58 , a point @xmath59 is an illuminating center if and only if it is a maximizer of @xmath60 ; as @xmath34 tends to zero , the kernel @xmath61 converges to @xmath62 uniformly for @xmath63 in @xmath64 ; roughly speaking , if the height parameter @xmath34 is small enough , then we have @xmath65 for any point @xmath42 in the interior of @xmath1 with @xmath66 .    in order to formulate the above procedure , we have to give a closed subset in the interior of @xmath1 such that it contains all the illuminating centers for any small enough @xmath55 .",
    "this is because we can use the expression of the potential @xmath53 only in the interior of @xmath1 .",
    "namely , in , we want to take a uniform @xmath56 for illuminating centers of any small enough height and maximizers of @xmath53 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the study on the location of maximizers of a potential .",
    "some authors tried to restrict the location of maximizers of a potential into a smaller region . using the _ moving plane argument _ ( @xcite ) , all the maximizers of a potential with a radially symmetric strictly decreasing kernel are contained in the _ minimal unfolded region _ of @xmath1 .",
    "( the minimal unfolded region is sometimes called the _ heart_. ) but , in general , the minimal unfolded region of @xmath1 is not contained in the interior of @xmath1 ( see example [ uf_triangle ] ) .    in this paper , assuming the _ uniform interior cone condition _ for the complement of the body @xmath1 ( see definition [ interior ] ) and taking the following three steps , we formulate the above procedure :    step 1 .",
