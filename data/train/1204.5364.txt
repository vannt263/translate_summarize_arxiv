    "transitional disks are a class of protoplanetary disks whose inner regions are devoid of small dust grains .",
    "these disks have been attracting attention recently , since such cleared inner regions or gaps may be related to on - going planet formation .",
    "the presence of an inner hole / gap has been suggested for the disk around the herbig ae star hd169142 by @xcite and @xcite , mostly based on the analysis of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "both groups conclude that the steep rise in flux at @xmath220@xmath0 m in the sed reflects emission from the wall of the outer disk . the location of the wall ( i.e. the inner edge of the outer disk ) has not been determined conclusively ",
    "@xcite used 20 au while @xcite suggested 44 au .",
    "observations of hd169142 at various wavelengths have so far not been able to constrain the inner cavity radius directly and accurately .",
    "one of the limitation of sed modeling is the inability to locate and prove the existence of gaps in proto - planetary disks .",
    "for instance , gaps may not be revealed in the sed because the inner disk can partially obscure large parts of the outer disk @xcite and gaps hidden under that shadow do not leave a fingerprint in the sed .",
    "clever sed modeling can reproduce seds of truly transitional disks without the need of a gap .",
    "the transitional disk lkca 15 has an outer disk starting at 46 au as seen at 1.4 and 2.8 mm wavelengths @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite show that a model approach with a smooth distribution of material from a few stellar radii to about 240 au can sometimes reproduce both the observed spectral energy distribution and the spatially resolved continuum emission at millimeter wavelengths for this object . only from direct imaging",
    "it is possible to directly constrain the radial density structure of dust in a proto - planetary disk .",
    "dust in proto - planetary disks covers a temperature range from @xmath21500 k at the inner dust sublimation radius to a few kelvin in the outer parts of the disk .",
    "direct mid - infrared ( mir ) imaging at 18.8 and 24.5@xmath0 m is most sensitive for 100 - 150k blackbody dust , though strong contributions from dust elsewhere in the disk at lower and higher temperatures can also be present .",
    "if the disk has a very strong nir component such as hd135344 @xcite , the inner region may still be strongly represented in the center of the image at 18 micron . on the other hand , for disks with a larger gap or an inner hole",
    ", the image size will be a sensitive tracer to the location of the inner radius of the outer disk @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present direct mir imaging observations of hd169142 at 18.8 and 24.5@xmath0 m , using comics on the 8.2 m subaru telescope .",
    "we confirm the result found by @xcite and find that the disk shows extended emission at 18@xmath0 m .",
    "in addition we find that the disk is also resolved at 24.5@xmath0 m . by constructing a radiative transfer disk model that fits both the sed and the imaging results , we find that the size of the source at mir wavelengths is most naturally explained by a disk with a large inner gap , i.e. transitional disk .",
    "we discuss the structure of the disk , and the implications for its nature .",
    "observations were conducted using comics ( cooled mid - infrared camera and spectrometer ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the 8.2 m subaru telescope on mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "hd169142 was observed using the q24.5-new ( @xmath3=24.5@xmath0 m , @xmath4=0.75@xmath0 m ) and q18.8(@xmath3=18.8@xmath0m,@xmath4=0.9@xmath0 m ) filters .",
    "the plate scale of the comics camera is 0.13 arcsec per pixel .",
    "the chopping throw was 10 arcsec and the position angle of chopping direction was 0 degree .",
    "the chopping frequency was 0.45 hz . the total integration time for q24.5 and q18.8 observations were 802s and 360s , respectively . just before and after observing hd169142 , we took data of psf reference and photometric standard stars .",
    "we used @xmath5 oph for q24.5 and @xmath6her for q18.8 .",
    "the total integration times for the reference stars were 243s and 83s , respectively .",
    "a summary of the observations is given in table 1 .",
    "we processed the data using a shift - and - add method to improve the blurring caused by atmosphere , tracking errors , misregistration , etc .",
    "the imaging data consists of 0.98s on - source integration frames .",
    "first , the thermal background and the dark current signals were removed through the subtraction of the chopped pair frames . the object and",
    "the psf star are bright enough to be recognized even in 0.98s chop - subtracted frames , so we searched the centroid of the object .",
    "we then shifted the frames so as to align the centroid position , and summed up the frames .",
    "however , we excluded frames which were blurred by atmospheric seeing .",
    "we rejected frames whose radius of 78.4% encircled energy ( @xmath7 ) is larger than thrshould radius ( @xmath8 ) which covers 95% of the wavefronts whose strehl ratio is 0.9 .",
    "these thrshould values are determined as @xmath9 at 18.8@xmath0 m and @xmath10 at 24.5@xmath0 m by monte carlo simulation of ideal unresolved point source . due to this rejection of lower quality data , the effective integration time of hd169142",
    "was reduced to 345s and 215s for q24.5 and q18.8 , respectively .",
    "the same procedure was applied to the psf images taken before and after hd169142 , where the effective integration time became to 195s and 83s , respectively . since hd169142 shows marginal extention compared to the psf and the rejection criterion @xmath8",
    "is determined for the ideal unresolved point source , frame rejection rates of hd169142 are higher than those of psf stars .",
    "it means that the effective rejection criterion is slightly more stringent for hd169142 than for psf stars , however , it does not overestimate the extention of hd169142 .    for flux calibration we used template spectrum provided by @xcite . using the standard stars observed over the two nights ,",
    "an airmass correction was applied for q24.5 photometry . for q18.8 photometry",
    ", we could not find a significant airmass dependence during the night .",
    "a standard aperture photometry was applied and the resultant flux density of hd169142 was @xmath11jy at 18.8@xmath0 m and @xmath12jy at 24.5@xmath0 m .",
    "the final images of the psf and hd169142 are shown in figure [ obsimages ] .",
    "the azimuthally - averaged radial brightness profiles of hd169142 and the psf stars at 18.8 and 24.5@xmath0 m are shown in figure [ fig : rbp ] .",
    "it is clear that hd169142 is extended at these wavelengths . at 18.8@xmath0",
    "m the direct fwhm of the shift - and - added images of hd169142 and of the psf stars were 0.604@xmath130.017  and 0.493@xmath130.006  , respectively . at 24.5@xmath0 m ,",
    "the corresponding numbers are 0.680@xmath130.034  and 0.628@xmath130.007  ( see table 1 ) . it is surprising that the size of hd169142 is not increasing with wavelength . for a continuous flaring disk",
    ", one would expect the size of the image to scale roughly with the psf @xcite .",
    "our images therefore give a first indication that the radial density structure is not continuous .",
    "the fwhms of the psf references are comparable to the predicted value of the diffraction limited performance of the telescope . as a rough estimate of the intrinsic source size of hd169142",
    ", we applied the quadratic subtraction method as described by @xcite .",
    "the derived source fwhms were 0.349@xmath130.014  at 18.8@xmath0 m and 0.261@xmath130.025  at 24.5@xmath0 m .",
    "since @xcite observed the fwhm of this source to be 0.32@xmath130.05  at 18.0@xmath0 m , our measurement at 18.8@xmath0 m is in good agreement with their results within the uncertainties .",
    "complementary views of the disk structure and the dust properties of hd169142 are obtained by adopting photometric data at various wavelengths from the literature @xcite and mir spectra from iso @xcite and spitzer / irs @xcite .",
    "these datasets reflect the disk brightness as a function of wavelength and are a result of the disk structure defined by the density distribution , composition , inclination , and inner and outer radius of the disk and by the properties of the central star . an outer disk radius of 235 au is taken from @xcite .",
    "an inner disk radius of 0.1 au is set at the location where the dust reaches 1500 k and starts to sublimate . with an inclination of 13@xmath14 @xcite ,",
    "the system is nearly pole - on and , therefore , deviations from axial symmetry caused by projection effects can be neglected in our images .",
    "the stellar spectrum is described by a kurucz model with an effective temperature of 8200 k @xcite , luminosity of 15.3 l@xmath15 and extinction a@xmath16=0.46 @xcite .",
    "the system is set at a distance of 145 pc @xcite .",
    "all stellar and disk parameters used in this paper are shown in table [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "we construct a geometrical model of the disk of hd169142 and fit it to both the radial surface brightness profile ( rbp ) of our observed images and to the sed .",
    "for the model we use the radiative transfer code mcmax @xcite , which is able to solve temperature and density structures in very optically thick circumstellar disks .",
    "this code has been compared to other radiative transfer codes by @xcite and has been applied successfully in previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we assume an axisymmetric dust distribution in which the optical properties of the grains are computed using a distribution of hollow spheres ( dhs ; * ? ? ?",
    "we consider all dust species in the disk to be in thermal contact , and calculate their respective opacities from the optical constants as if they were separate particles .",
    "furthermore we assume the gas temperature to be set by the dust temperature .",
    "we adopted grains with sizes according to the power - law @xmath17 .",
    "the power - law index is that of interstellar grains @xcite and is consistent with collisional fragmentation considerations @xcite . under the assumption that the system is in hydrostatic equilibrium ,",
    "the vertical density distribution of the disk is solved by iterating the density and temperature structures until they become self - consistent ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we assume a grain population consisting of 30% carbon and 70% silicates ( we refer to @xcite for references of the optical properties of this dust composition ) .",
    "the contribution of warm small ( @xmath18 10 @xmath0 m ) amorphous silicate grains to the spectrum must be low , since the flux level at 10 @xmath0 m is very low compared to that at 20 @xmath0 m .",
    "we model this change in flux level by replacing the amorphous silicate dust in the inner disk with dust with a higher continuum opacity .",
    "we here use carbon , but other dust species such as metallic iron may give the same result .",
    "this treatment is consistent with @xcite who find that grain growth in the innermost regions has proceeded further than in the outer disk regions .",
    "we have not attempted to fit the pah features in detail , though we implement them into our model to fit the sed . scattered",
    "light contribution is also included and the fraction of the scattered light to the total flux density in 18.8 and 24.5 @xmath0 m is 2226% in this model",
    ".     left and middle panels are model brightness distribution of final model and model image after convolved by subaru / comics psf ( middle ) , respectively , shown in jy / arcsec@xmath19 .",
    "right panels represents the peak - normalized azimuthally - averaged radial brightness profiles relative to the centroid of the image ( right ) .",
    "top panels are in the q18.8 and the bottom panels are in the q24.5 filters . in the radial profile plots ( right ) , the observation of hd169142 is shown by the red diamonds , and the corresponding psf of the calibrators is shown by the black squares . the final model convolved with the psf",
    "is shown by the black dotted line . ]",
    "we fit the sed as well as the 18.8 and 24.5 @xmath0 m images simultaneously by using the disk parameters shown in table [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "the rbps and sed of our final best fit model are shown by the the purple dashed lines in figures [ fig : rbp ] and [ fig : sed ] .",
    "a cartoon sketch is given in figure [ fig : cartoon ] . in this section",
    "we will first discuss the geometrical characteristics of the location of the gap and the outer disk properties .",
    "thereafter we discuss the constraints we find to the inner disk structure of the best fitting model .",
    "previous sed modeling by @xcite and @xcitesuggested a gap in the disk with an outer radius of 20 and 44 au respectively .",
    "we confirm and improve on this result by our test modeling for hd169142 : disks without a gap fail to fit the sed , despite various attempts within the physically reasonably parameter space .",
    "so already the sed fitting gives a strong indication for the presence of a gap ( confirming the results by @xcite and @xcite , even though its size is not well constrained at all from the sed alone .",
    "we incorporate this result and include a gap in our model .",
    "the effect of the discontinuity in the radial density structure is that a large fraction of the stellar light now falls on the vertical wall at the inner edge of the outer disk .",
    "emission from this wall is clearly distinguishable in the sed ( figure [ fig : sed ] , illustrated by the red dotted - line ) .",
    "in addition , figure [ fig : sed ] shows that the flux contribution from the inner edge ( between 23 - 26 au ) dominates at 18.8 and 24.5 @xmath0 m and that flux contributions from the inner regions and from the outer disk are negligible at these wavelengths .",
    "therefore , our subaru / comics images at 18.8 and 24.5 @xmath0 m are sensitive tracers of the radius where the outer disk starts .",
    "another insight to understand the dominance of the wall is given by the radial density and temperature plots of the outer disk of this model in figure [ fig : dens ] .",
    "the dotted lines show that the densest regions are largely optically thick",
    ". therefore the temperature of the disk mid - plane decreases rapidly as a function of radius .",
    "thus 18.8 and 24.5 @xmath0 m photons are mostly produced at the inner few au radii of the outer disk .",
    "the radius where the outer disk starts is not well constrained by sed modeling .",
    "because the disk structure is degenerate by uncertainties of many parameters like the stellar temperature and luminosity , the interstellar extinction , the grain size population of the dust , the vertical density structure and so on . only by fitting our model to the resolved mir observations we can unambiguously confirm the existence of a gap and constrain the location of the wall of the outer disk .",
    "after convolving our best fit model with the psfs of the calibrators , we find that the imaging data is fitted best with an inner edge of the outer disk of 23@xmath1au ( see fig.[fig : rbp ] ) .",
    "the uncertainty on this radius is determined by fitting the uncertainty of the azimuthally averaged flux level at @xmath131 sigma .",
    "this result is consistent with a wall radius of 20 au @xcite but excludes the model with a wall at 44 au @xcite .",
    "we have performed a small parameter study where we have examined the robustness of our final model to fit the rbps at mir wavelengths .",
    "we have varied the following parameters : the surface density powerlaw between \\{-0.5 , -1.5 } , the grain size distribution powerlaw \\{-2.5 , -4.5 } , the dust settling factor \\{0.5 , 1 } , the stellar temperature \\{8000 k , 8500 k } and luminosity \\{13 l@xmath20 , 17 l@xmath20 } and the distance \\{130 pc , 160 pc}. while the rpb only vary slightly in this parameter study ( all within the 1 sigma error of the measurements ) , the sed fit becomes significantly worse .",
    "we conclude that the radius of the wall is the only free parameter which significantly influences the broadness of the rbp",
    ". therefore our fit to the rbp is robust in constraining the radius of the inner edge of the outer disk at 23@xmath1 au .      in this section",
    "we explain in more detail the implications for the inner disk structure .",
    "modeling shows that an optically thick hydrostatic inner disk does not produce enough flux to fit the sed . scaling up the vertical height of the inner disk would not be a solution because if the inner disk is higher than z / r @xmath2 0.1 it covers the outer disk for more than @xmath250% in direct and scattered light .",
    "this inner disk then casts a too large shadow on the outer disk to be able to reproduce the sed at wavelengths longer than @xmath210 @xmath0 m . to solve this problem",
    "we include a geometrically thick , _ optically thin _",
    "halo - like dust cloud to the inner regions ( @xmath18 0.5 au , see figure [ fig : dens ] ) to fit the sed in the nir and to avoid a shadowing effect on the outer disk .",
    "the physical origin is not certain at this moment , though other observational studies show that an optically thin component close to the star provides a good fit as well @xcite .",
    "furthermore , fitting the herbig stars median sed requires such a halo @xcite .",
    "further high spatial resolution observations such as infrared interferometry will be necessary to reveal the inner disk structure .",
    "if there is no shadowing effect from the inner disk , the wall of the outer disk is too luminous . to fit the sed again",
    ", we can either settle the grains in the outer disk by scaling down the dust density scaleheight by a factor of 0.6 or we can scale down the abundance of small ( @xmath18 1 @xmath0 m ) grains by one order of magnitude .",
    "these adjustments are consistent with dust settling and grain growth @xcite , however , it is uncertain to what extent these effects are present in the disk .",
    "the influence of other effects like dynamical scattering of larger dust grains may also play a role in the vertical grain size distribution .",
    "alternatively , we can _ combine _ a halo - like dust cloud and a flat inner disk and consequently perform no settling or removal of small dust grains .",
    "so we conclude that there are two possible inner disk geometries ( as illustrated in the cartoon in figure [ fig : cartoon ] ) which give an equally good fit to the sed and the rbp .    without an optically thick inner disk , the rbp is still reproduced with the inner radius of the outer disk at 23@xmath1 au . the final model can be interpreted as an inner halo - like dust cloud @xcite and a gas - rich outer disk structure , so truly a transitional disk .",
    "we have shown observational evidence for the presence of an inner hole or gap in the hd169142 disk . a similar structure is also indicated for other herbig ae / be stars such as abaur @xcite , hd142527 @xcite , hd135344 @xcite , hd36112 @xcite , hd100546 @xcite .",
    "all of these objects have been classified as group i according to the definition introduced by @xcite . since the strong far infrared excess is a characteristic of group i sources , we speculate that this component may come from the emission from the inner - edge of the outer disk .",
    "consequently , we suggest that the inner hole or gap structure may be common for group i sources . if this is true , the hypothesis that the group i flared disks evolves into the group ii flat disks due to dust sedimentation should be reconsidered , because the difference of group i and ii is not only the degree of disk flaring or grain growth , but also the presence of cleared inner regions ( holes and gaps ) in the disk .    as we have shown in the above analysis , the spatial extent of a herbig ae / be disk at mir wavelengths , often described by a fwhm , is strongly influenced by the position and temperature of the wall .",
    "previous studies showed that group i sources are likely to be more extended than group ii sources in the mir wavelengths , and suggested that the disk geometry ( flaring or flat disk ) may play an important role in the thermal structure and mir emission of the disk @xcite .",
    "our 24.5@xmath0 m imaging survey of herbig ae / be stars with subaru / comics ( honda et al . in preparation ) also confirms that many group i sources are extended , however , their spatial extent shows a great diversity , from marginally to remarkably extended .",
    "such diversity in the spatial extent in the mir can be understood in terms of the distance , the inner disk structure and the location of the wall of the outer disk .",
    "in fact , the temperature of the wall both in the abaur and hd142527 systems appears to be relatively cool ( 70 - 100 k ) and its wall radius also tends to be at some distance away from the central star (  100 au in ab aur ;  170 au in hd142527 @xcite ) .",
    "the wall in hd169142 is at a smaller distance ( 23au ) , thus the spatial extent is not so large compared to that of ab aur and hd142527 .",
    "we suggest that not only the geometry ( flared or flat ) of the disk , but also the inner gap and a wall - like inner edge of the outer disk are important for understanding the spatial extent of herbig ae / be disks in the mir .",
    "gaps seem to be a common characteristic of the group i flaring disks @xcite . an inner hole or gap in the disk has been explained by several mechanisms , including ( 1 ) photoevaporation of the disk @xcite , ( 2 ) geometric shadowing @xcite , ( 3 ) grain growth in the inner disk causing a lower dust opacity zone @xcite , and ( 4 ) the presence of another body in the disk that dynamically creates a gap and decouples the inner disk from the outer disk @xcite .",
    "we prefer solution ( 4 ) since this also provides a natural explanation for a inner halo - like dust cloud in the inner disk .",
    "the presence of a halo likely requires some dynamical interactions with planetary bodies since new generations of dust can than be created in situ up to large disk heights @xcite .",
    "grain growth can not explain the presence of a gap and a wall .",
    "furthermore , our test models show that geometric shadowing ( i.e. varying scaleheights , surface density powerlaws ) of a part of the disk at several au can not reproduce the sed and the rbp of the images .",
    "we recognize that planetary companions have not yet been detected in the transitional disk around hd169142 , though recent direct detection of the planets around a type stars ( e.g. hr8799 ; @xcite , @xmath21pic @xcite ) leads support for such hypothesis .",
    "thus we suggest that the hd169142 system is an excellent candidate to look for newly - formed planets in the protoplanetary disk .",
    "we arrive at the following conclusions :    1 .   [ item:1 ] hd169142",
    "is extended at mir wavelengths with the subaru / comics instrument .",
    "the derived source sizes from quadratic psf reference subtraction are 0.349@xmath130.014  at 18.8@xmath0 m and 0.261@xmath130.025  at 24.5@xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "[ item:2 ] the observed sizes as well as the steep rise of the sed near 20@xmath0 m require a disk model with an inner hole the size of 23@xmath1au , making hd169142 a transitional disk .",
    "3 .   [ item:3 ] hd169142 is one of a growing number of herbig ae disks that are classified as group i source and that _ also _ require the presence of a large inner gap .",
    "it appears that many if not all group i sources may be strong candidates for classification as transitional disks .",

    "<S> the disk around the herbig ae star hd169142 was imaged and resolved at 18.8 and 24.5@xmath0 m using subaru / comics . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret the observations using a 2d radiative transfer model and find evidence for the presence of a large gap . </S>",
    "<S> the mir images trace dust that emits at the onset of the strong rise in the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) at 20@xmath0 m , therefore are very sensitive to the location and characteristics of the inner wall of the outer disk and its dust . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the location of the wall to be 23@xmath1au from the star . </S>",
    "<S> an extra component of hot dust must exist close to the star . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a hydrostatic optically thick inner disk does not produce enough flux in the nir and an optically thin geometrically thick component is our solution to fit the sed . </S>",
    "<S> considering the recent findings of gaps and holes in a number of herbig ae / be group i disks , we suggest that such disk structures may be common in group i sources . </S>",
    "<S> classification as group i should be considered a support for classification as a transitional disk , though improved imaging surveys are needed to support this speculation . </S>"
