    "the average power of the pump laser is measured to be 10 mw .",
    "the type - ii ppktp crystal has the dimension of @xmath39 mm@xmath40 and is phase - matched at 78.8@xmath41c for degenerate ( 812.4 nm ) and non - collinear ( @xmath42 with respect to the pump direction ) photon - pair generation via spontaneous parametric down - conversion . to prepare a pure polarisation - entangled photon pair via type - ii spdc ,",
    "it is essential that the coherence time of the pump must be much bigger than the dimension of the nonlinear crystal . since this condition can not be satisfied in our case , we made use of the bell - state synthesiser scheme in ref .",

    "this scheme allows us to generate high - quality polarisation - entangled photon pairs regardless of crystal thickness , pump bandwidth , and spectral filtering .",
    "quantum state tomography performed on the experimental two - photon state exhibits indeed high - quality two - photon polarisation entanglement with concurrence of 0.942 and fidelity ( compared to the ideal @xmath48 state ) of 0.960 . +",

    ", the walker s position corresponds to one of the four @xmath56 time grids : @xmath57 and @xmath58 . at the second step @xmath59 , each of the temporal modes from the first step branches into four different modes , leading to nine distinct temporal modes for the 2d quantum walk .",

    "the probability that a single photon at the input of the @xmath7 step operation ( i.e. , just before coin 1 in fig .  [ scheme ] ) is found at spd is roughly @xmath61 where the detector efficiency at 812 nm is roughly @xmath62 and the per cycle transmittance is @xmath63 which includes the splitting ratio of the bs , the fibre attenuation coefficient ( 3 db / km ) , the fibre coupling efficiency , and the fc connector loss .",
    "the present setup has rather high loss because the experimental setup was built using off - the - shelf components .",
    "thus , there is plenty of room for improvement , for instance , by optimizing the splitting ratio of the bs , and by using low - loss fibre couplers and fc connectors .",
    "+ * data acquisition and analysis .",
    "* to reconstruct the 2d quantum walk probability distributions from the events distributed in the time grid , it is necessary to measure the histogram of time - of - arrival events for the single photons .",
    "this was done by observing the coincidence events between alice s and bob s detectors ( perkin - elmer aqr ) using a time - correlated single - photon counting ( tcspc ) device ( picoharp 300 at 8 ps per bin resolution ) .",
    "a coincidence peak in the time grid typically has the width of 0.6 ns at fwhm so to ensure that no coincidence peaks are overlapped , we have judiciously chosen the optical delays ( @xmath1 @xmath2 @xmath3 ) such that neighbouring peaks are at least 4.1 ns separated . to extract the data , a 2 ns window was defined for each time grid and the total coincidence counts within the 2 ns window was recorded .",
    "the raw coincidence counts were then corrected for accidental counts and losses .",
    "the 2d quantum walk probability distribution @xmath64 for the time grid @xmath56 was obtained by normalising the corrected coincidence counts with the total coincidence counts for a particular step @xmath18 . typical data accumulation time was 5 hours per probability distribution . +",
    "* grover walk . *",
    "let us denote the hilbert spaces of the coin subsystem and the walker subsystem as @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively , and we choose @xmath67 as a basis of @xmath66 .",
    "differently from the scheme exploited in this paper , where the walks along the horizontal axis and the vertical axis are alternated , the standard grover walk has full freedom at each point of the space to make vertical ( up / down ) and horizontal ( left / right ) moves . reflecting these four possibilities ,",
    "the coin operation is defined in a four - dimensional space .",
    "the single time step is a sequence of the coin operation ( acting only on the coin subspace ) @xmath68 and the conditional shift operation    @xmath69    notice that , if the coin is embodied by a pair of qubits , @xmath70 is an entangling gate .",
    "this standard grover walk is interesting , in particular , because one can exploit this scheme for the implementation of the grover search algorithm  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been proven that , for almost all the possible initial conditions of the coin ( with the walker initially starting at the origin ) , one can observe a striking phenomenon of localisation  @xcite .",
    "this means that the probability of finding the walker at the origin does not go asymptotically to zero for a number of time steps going to infinity .    in our scheme ,",
    "the coin is embodied by a two - level system , with the coin operation given by the hadamard gate @xmath71 in this case , there are two different conditional shift operations ,    @xmath72    and    @xmath73    the evolution of the system is an alternate sequence of a coin operation followed by @xmath74 and a coin operation followed by @xmath75 .",
    "it has been shown that this alternate walk is able to perfectly reproduce the spatial probability distribution of the non - localised case of the grover walk  @xcite .",

    "<S> many paradoxes of quantum mechanics come from the fact that a quantum system can possess different features at the same time , such as in wave - particle duality or quantum superposition . in recent delayed - choice experiments , </S>",

    "<S> the way in which a photon interferes with itself in a strongly non - trivial pattern depends on its polarisation , that is determined after the photon has already been detected . </S>",
    "<S> multi - dimensional quantum walks are a very powerful tool for simulating the behaviour of complex quantum systems , due to their versatility . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first experiment realising a multi - dimensional quantum walk with a single - photon source and we present also the first experimental simulation of the grover walk , a model that can be used to implement the grover quantum search algorithm .    </S>",
    "<S> the delayed - choice experiment , proposed by wheeler  @xcite and demonstrated in different setups  @xcite , highlights one of the most intriguing aspects of quantum mechanics : a photon , traveling in a mach - zehnder interferometer , can or can not self - interfere ( and thus behave as a wave or a particle ) depending on the configuration of the interferometer itself . in particular , it is possible to postpone this choice after the photon has already passed the interference stage or even after the photon has already been detected , hence the name  delayed - choice \" . while , in its standard version , the choice is between having or not having interference , nothing prevents one from realising a scheme in which the choice determines different interference patterns . </S>",
    "<S> recognising the role of quantum interference in the time evolution of quantum walks  @xcite , here we adapt the delayed - choice experiment to multi - dimensional quantum walks and experimentally demonstrate the delayed - choice two - dimensional quantum walk . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first experiment realising a multi - dimensional quantum walk with a single - photon source . </S>",
    "<S> we also present the first experimental simulation of the grover walk , a model that can be used to implement the grover quantum search algorithm .    the classical random walk ( i.e. </S>",
    "<S> , the mathematical description of a movement consisting of a sequence of random steps ) is a fundamental process in statistical mechanics  @xcite , finding applications in various fields , from physics to computer science , from economics to biology  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , random walks are a basis for many powerful classical algorithms . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum walk  @xcite , the quantum mechanical analogue of the classical random walk , behaves in a strikingly different way from its classical counterpart , due to the quantum coherences between the walker s paths . </S>",
    "<S> its fast diffusive behaviour is closely related to the quadratic speedup of the grover quantum search algorithm  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> several applications of quantum walks have been found , in simulating quantum circuits  @xcite , describing quantum lattice gas models  @xcite , or exploring topological phases  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another possible application of quantum walks is the investigation on biophysical systems , in particular the analysis and the simulation of the energy transport in the photosynthesis process  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> witnessing the strong interest in the topic , the uni - dimensional quantum walk ( i.e. , a quantum walk in which the movement is only allowed on a line ) has already been experimentally implemented in a number of different physical systems , ranging from neutral atoms in spin - dependent optical lattices to ions in a linear ion trap , from photons in arrays of evanescently coupled waveguides to optical setups with a fibre network loop and only passive optical elements , for instance  @xcite . and </S>",
    "<S> yet , the realisation of multi - dimensional quantum walks ( i.e. , quantum walks with movement on more than one dimension ) is extremely challenging , due to the significant technological effort required . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the multi - dimensional scenario promises many interesting and important features that are not present in the one - dimensional case , and that clearly deserve to be observed and investigated in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> a noticeable example is the implementation of the quantum search algorithm , that outperforms the classical counterparts only when the dimension of the walk is higher than one  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that one - dimensional quantum walks are not efficient for this task . </S>",
    "<S> a first step in experimental two - dimensional quantum walks has been recently reported in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where the classical interference effects of laser pulses _ simulate _ the evolution of a quantum walker on a two - dimensional lattice .    in this paper , we demonstrate the first delayed - choice experiment applied to a two - dimensional quantum walk . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we exploit the protocol proposed in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where it has been shown that the spatial probability distribution of the non - localised case of the grover walk ( the two - dimensional walk exploited for the quantum search ) can be obtained using only a single - qubit coin and a quantum walk in alternate directions . </S>",
    "<S> the single - qubit coin is realised with the polarisation state of a single photon so that interference by quantum particles is responsible for the rapid spread of the walker s position in the two - dimensional lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the use of single photons allows us to adapt the delayed - choice scheme to the quantum walk scenario . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , an interesting feature of quantum walks is that the probability distribution is affected by the initial conditions , unlike their classical counterpart . in other words , the initial state of the coin ( i.e. </S>",
    "<S> , the polarisation of the single photon , in our case ) determines the pattern of self - interference that gives rise to the distribution measured at the end of the walk . in our experiment , the single photon shares quantum entanglement with an ancillary photon and , because of the entanglement </S>",
    "<S> , its polarisation is not defined _ a priori_. measurement on the ancillary photon , however , has the effect of `` inducing '' a decision on which interference pattern the quantum walker has to follow . in our delayed - choice experiment </S>",

    "<S> this fast diffusive behaviour is due to the quantum coherences between the walker s paths . </S>",

    "<S> [ inputvhda ] , we show the probability distributions of the 2d quantum walk after @xmath19 steps for different delayed - choice coin states and it is straightforward to see that the coin state , which is determined remotely after the photon has already been registered at the detector , strongly affects the probability distribution .    . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) experimental simulation of the 2d grover walk at @xmath19 with the delayed - choice coin state @xmath21 , corresponding to alice s projection on @xmath24.,width=288 ]    we now discuss an important application of our scheme , the simulation of the grover walk . in the range of 2d </S>",
    "<S> quantum walks that can be obtained for different coin operations , a particular attention has been given to the grover one  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is a particular quantum walk that has recently attracted wide interest as it can implement the 2d grover search algorithm  @xcite . in order to realise the standard grover walk , </S>",
    "<S> one requires a four - dimensional coin . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , if the coin is embodied by two qubits , the coin operation that one has to apply each time step is a particular entangling gate , which could be very difficult to realise . even if , as reported in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , schreiber _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ were able to implement an entangling gate of a specific form , realising the one required for the grover walk in their setting is not a trivial extension . in the grover </S>",
    "<S> walk , the walker is always localised unless the coin is in the particular initial state @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> see methods for details on the grover walk .    </S>",
    "<S> it was shown in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that the non - localised case of the 2d grover walk can be simulated on a two - dimensional lattice using the hadamard coin operation and a single - qubit coin with the initial coin state @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> this can be straightforwardly realised with our setting and , in this case , the coin state corresponds to the right circular polarisation state @xmath21 which is prepared remotely by alice s delayed - choice projection on @xmath24 . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ grover ] , the experimentally observed probability distribution agrees well with the theoretically calculated ideal 2d grover walk using a four - dimensional coin and the grover coin operation .        </S>",
    "<S> so far , we have considered the cases in which the coin states are prepared _ a posteriori _ in pure quantum states . </S>",
    "<S> one can then ask whether a walk with the coin in a mixed state would exhibit a similar quantum behaviour . for a classical pulse , </S>",
    "<S> such a scenario is normally not straightforward to implement without a numerical sum of the experimental data from different settings . </S>",
    "<S> however , in our scheme where we make use of entangled photons and projection measurements for the coin state preparation , we can easily realise a 2d quantum walk experiment with a mixed initial coin state by simply removing the polarisation projection optical element from alice s setup . </S>",
    "<S> since alice and bob share a polarisation - entangled photon pair , without the polarisation projection in alice s side , the initial coin state of bob s photon is in a maximally - mixed state . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental result is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ mixed ] and , interestingly , the 2d quantum walk with the maximally - mixed initial coin state shows quantum behaviours . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , the probability distribution obtained in this case is the same as the one when the initial state of the coin is pure and equal to @xmath24 or @xmath21  @xcite .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we report the first realisation of delayed - choice experiment in a quantum walk scenario . </S>",
    "<S> a striking aspect of quantum mechanics is that the measurement apparatus itself determines which feature the quantum system under investigation manifests . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the feature of the quantum particle which will be manifested at the measurement is not predetermined . in our delayed - choice experiment with quantum walks , </S>",
    "<S> the self - interference pattern depends on the polarisation of the photon embodying the walker . </S>",
    "<S> this polarisation is decided , due to quantum correlations , by a successive measurement on an ancillary photon . </S>",
    "<S> the time delay between the actual interference stage ( and photon detection ) and the ancilla measurement ensures that the pattern can not be predetermined . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results clearly show the characteristics of quantum walks and , with the use of single photons , we have directly demonstrated 2d quantum walks due to quantum interference , rather than simulating the effects based on wave mechanics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we have also experimentally shown the correspondence between the grover walk and alternate walk with a single - qubit coin . </S>",
    "<S> our scheme can efficiently be expanded to implement 2d quantum walks on the order of hundreds of steps and demonstration of such massive quantum parallelism might bring out their real - life applications . furthermore , the scheme presented in this paper can be slightly modified in order to demonstrate higher - dimensional quantum walks  @xcite , a very striking result for the simulation of multi - particle evolution and generation of genuine multi - partite entanglement . as specified in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the increasing of the dimension of the lattice on which the walker can move in a standard multi - dimensional quantum walk requires the exploitation of additional degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is that the hilbert space of the coin grows as well ( and exponentially with the number of dimensions  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , the coin remains a single qubit in our scheme , independently of the dimension of the position lattice . </S>",
    "<S> this is clearly an advantage in terms of experimental resources , as the only change that has to be done is an additional stage ( like the ones denoted as @xmath7 and @xmath0 in fig .  [ scheme ] ) for each extra dimension . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the required number of optical elements scales linearly . </S>",
    "<S> this reflects the novel aspect of our scheme , not just to the time - multiplexing approach or the use of a heralded single - photon source . </S>"
