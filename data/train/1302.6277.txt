    "left - handed ( lh ) metamaterials are artificial , effectively homogeneous structures , featuring negative refractive index at specific frequency bands where the effective permittivity @xmath0 and permeability @xmath1 are simultaneously negative @xcite .",
    "in fact , all known realizations of lh metamaterials rely on the use of common right - handed ( rh ) elements and , thus , in a realistic situation such a composite material features both a lh and a rh behavior , in certain frequency bands . physically speaking , the difference between the two is that in the lh ( rh ) regime , the energy and the wave fronts of the electromagnetic ( em ) waves propagate in the opposite ( same ) directions , giving rise to backward- ( forward- ) propagating waves .",
    "transmission line ( tl ) theory constitutes a convenient framework for the analysis of lh metamaterials .",
    "such an analysis relies on the connection of the em properties of the medium ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) with the electric elements of the tl s unit cell , namely the serial and shunt impedance . as mentioned above , in practice _",
    "composite right / left - handed ( crlh ) _ structures are quite relevant , giving rise to pertinent crlh - tl models .",
    "these models are , in fact , dynamical lattices which can be used for the description of a variety of metamaterials - based devices and systems , such as resonators , directional couplers , antennas , etc @xcite .",
    "nonlinear crlh - tls , with a serial or / and shunt impedance depending on voltages or currents , have also attracted attention .",
    "such structures may be realized by inserting diodes  which mimic voltage - controlled nonlinear capacitors  into resonant conductive elements ( such as split - ring resonators ) @xcite .",
    "such nonlinear crlh - tl models have been used in various works dealing , e.g. , with the parametric shielding of em fields @xcite , the long - short wave interaction @xcite , or soliton formation @xcite .",
    "experiments in nonlinear crlh - tls have also been performed ( see the review @xcite ) , and formation of bright @xcite or dark @xcite envelope solitons , described by an effective nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation , was reported .",
    "notice that in earlier studies on rh - tl models it was shown that two ( or more ) solitons propagating with the same group velocity , can be described by a system of two ( or more ) nls equations @xcite ( see also @xcite for theoretical as well as experimental results ) .",
    "such coupled nls equations have been studied extensively in nonlinear optics and mathematical physics ; see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "they are well - known to give rise to a variety of vector solitons , including bright - bright , bright - dark , and dark - dark ones .    in this work ,",
    "we study analytically and numerically the interaction between backward- and forward - propagating solitons in a nonlinear crlh - tl .",
    "our model is a nonlinear version of a generic crlh - tl model ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) : the considered nonlinear element in the unit cell of the tl is the shunt capacitor , which simulates the presence of a heterostracture barrier varactor ( hbv ) diode @xcite ( the capacitance of the hbv diode depends on the applied voltage ) .",
    "starting from the discrete lump element model of the crlh - tl , we derive a nonlinear lattice equation .",
    "first , we study the linear regime and show that , for certain frequency bands , rh- and lh - modes can propagate with the same group velocity . next , we treat the nonlinear lattice equation in the framework of the _ quasi - discrete _ ( or _ quasi - continuum _ ) approximation ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite for a review ) : we thus seek for envelope soliton solutions of the nonlinear lattice model , characterized by a _",
    "discrete carrier _ and a _ continuum envelope _ and employ an asymptotic multi - scale expansion method , to derive a system of two coupled nls equations .",
    "each of these equations describes the evolution of the envelope of a backward- ( lh- ) and a forward - propagating ( rh- ) mode .",
    "a systematic analysis of the system of the nls equations reveals the existence in certain frequency bands of three different types of vector solitons : ( a ) a backward - propagating bright soliton coupled with a forward - propagating bright soliton , ( b ) a backward - propagating bright soliton coupled with a forward - propagating dark soliton .",
    "( c ) a backward - propagating dark soliton coupled with a forward - propagating bright soliton , and    the above analytical predictions are then tested against direct numerical simulations , which are performed in the framework of the original nonlinear lattice model .",
    "the results of the simulations verify the existence of the aforementioned types of vector solitons in the full tl model , but also offer important information regarding their robustness .",
    "in particular , results of direct simulations performed for long times indicate that bright - bright solitons are the most robust among the members of the vector soliton family .",
    "indeed , the mixed ( dark - bright or bright - dark ) types are found to be less robust ; however , the dark - bright solitons in a specific frequency band , although they are deformed during their evolution , are found to be more robust than those in other bands , as well as the bright - dark solitons , which are destroyed for the same propagation time . in any case , our results indicate the existence of all three types , robustness of bright - bright solitons and partial or substantial deformation of the other types .",
    "we can thus conclude that bright - bright ( lh - rh ) , as well as dark - bright ( lh - rh ) solitons in certain frequency bands , have a better chance to be observed in experiments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  ii",
    ", we introduce the nonlinear crlh - tl model and the pertinent lattice equation , and derive the system of the two coupled nls equations ( relevant details are also appended in an appendix ) . in section  iii ,",
    "we present analytical and numerical results for each type of vector soliton .",

    "we consider a generic crlh - tl , composed by both right- and left - handed elements , as shown in its unit - cell circuit shown in fig .",

    "the ( rh ) elements of this tl are the inductance @xmath2 and capacitance @xmath3 , while the lh ones are the inductance @xmath4 and capacitance @xmath5 .",
    "we assume that the tl is loaded with a nonlinear capacitance ( @xmath6 , while the capacitance @xmath7 will be assumed to be fixed and voltage independent ) .",
    "this can be implemented by proper insertion of diodes in the tl ( see , e.g. , pertinent experiments as well as theoretical work in refs .",
    "@xcite ) ; in other words , we assume that the shunt capacitor @xmath6 is nonlinear ( see details below ) .",

    "i.e. , we consider the case where the tl has a more pronounced lh character ; however , when considering the linear setting ( see next subsection ) , this parameter will also assume other values , corresponding to the balanced and rh - dominated behaviour as well .      [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     figures  [ fig : db13sim1 ] and [ fig : db13sim2 ] show the outcome of the simulations for a dark - bright soliton in bands i and iii ( with @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) , while figs .",

    "the relatively large values of the number of particles and of @xmath74 used are motivated by the necessity of a vanishing tail for the bright component at the edges of the lattice .",
    "as seen in this set of figures , dark - bright solitons in bands ii - iii and i - iii do exist , as predicted in theory .",
    "furthermore , it is observed that the former are less robust than the latter , as seen both from their stronger deformation and the fact that they `` lose '' their solitary wave character earlier .",
    "this can be observed , e.g. , in the strong fluctuations in the evolution of the soliton center in the bottom left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : db23sim2 ] , or perhaps most notably in the substantial modification of the wave profile upon long propagation in the top right panel of the same figure . on the other hand , the dark - bright solitons of bands",
    "i - iii seem to essentially preserve their structure even in the long evolution of fig .",
    "[ fig : db13sim2 ] .",
    "in conclusion , we have used both analytical and numerical techniques to study the existence , stability and dynamics of coupled backward- and forward - propagating solitons in a composite right / left - handed ( crlh ) nonlinear transmission line ( tl ) .",
    "the considered form of the tl was a quite generic one , finding applications to the modelling of a wide range of lh systems and devices , with `` parasitic '' rh behavior , such as resonators , antennas , directional couplers , among others  @xcite .",
    "our analysis started with the derivation of a nonlinear lattice equation governing the voltage across the fundamental ( unit cell ) element of the transmission line . in the linear regime , we derived the dispersion relation for small - amplitude linear plane waves and showed that they may either propagate in a right - handed ( rh ) high - frequency region , or in a left - handed ( lh ) low - frequency region .",
    "we also identified frequency bands where rh- and lh - modes can propagate with the same group velocity .    using the above result",
    ", we then investigated the possibility of nonlinearity - assisted coupling between lh- and rh - modes .",
    "this way , in order to analytically treat the nonlinear lattice equation , we used the so - called quasi - discrete approximation .",
    "the latter is a variant of the multi - scale perturbation method , which takes into regard the discreteness of the system by considering the carrier ( envelope ) of the wave as a discrete ( continuum ) function of space . employing this approach",
    ", we derived , in the small - amplitude approximation and for certain space- and time - scales , a system of two coupled nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equations for the unknown voltage envelope functions .",
    "this system was then used to predict the existence of coupled backward- and forward - propagating solitons , of the bright - bright , bright - dark and dark - bright type , respectively .",
    "the above existence results , as well as the propagation properties and the potential robustness of these vector solitons , were then investigated for each of the possible scenarios .",
    "this was done by means of direct numerical simulations of the full crlh - tl nonlinear lattice model , using as initial conditions the analytical forms of solitons predicted by the perturbation theory . in the simulations ,",
    "apart from the evolution of the shape , we also studied the evolution of the center of mass and a power - like quantity of the various solitons .",
    "our numerical results have confirmed the existence of the various types of solitons predicted analytically , but have also revealed their distinct robustness characteristics .",
    "in particular , we found that bright - bright solitons feature a robust propagation over long times . on the other hand , as concerns solitons of the mixed - type ( namely dark - bright and bright - dark ones ) , we found that , in specific frequency bands ( bands i - iii ) , dark - bright solitons are more robust than those in other bands ( i.e. , ii - iii ) or bright - dark solitons : dark - bright solitons in bands ii - iii and bright dark solitons preserve their shape only for finite times and , for sufficiently long evolutions , they are either destroyed ( bright - dark ) or are significantly deformed ( dark - bright ) .",
    "we can thus postulate that from all types of solitons predicted analytically , bright - bright and dark - bright ones ( in bands i - iii ) are the most likely ones to be experimentally observable . in all cases ,",
    "our numerical results were found to corroborate the analytical predictions , at least up to the times during which the solitary waves propagate robustly .",
    "it would be interesting to study other types of nonlinear crlh - tl lattice models modelling realistic structures composed by lh - metamaterials . in that regard",
    ", a pertinent interesting direction would be the investigation of the effects of damping and driving , which may lead to robust nonlinear waveforms which would constitute dynamical attractors in such settings .",
    "additionally , the study of higher - dimensional settings is a particularly challenging problem . in the latter context ,",
    "in addition to simpler ( yet genuinely higher dimensional , or even quasi - one - dimensional ) solitary wave structures , more complex waveforms may be realizable such as vortices .",
    "the exploration of such states and their dynamical robustness will be reported in future publications .",
