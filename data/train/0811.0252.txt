    "`` post - starburst '' galaxies , also known as `` e+a '' or `` k+a '' galaxies , are identified on the basis of their optical spectra for the exceptionally strong balmer lines in absorption and the lack of emission lines ( dressler & gunn 1983 , couch & sharples 1987 ) .",
    "extensive spectrophotometric modeling has demonstrated that this spectral combination arises if the star formation ( sf ) activity has ended abruptly sometime between @xmath2 and @xmath3 years prior to observations ( couch & sharples 1987 , newberry , boroson & kirshner 1990 , abraham et al .",

    "only those spectra with the strongest balmer lines require a recent burst , while k+a spectra with moderate line strengths can be modelled as post - starforming galaxies in which the truncation follows a regular star formation activity . in the latter cases ,",
    "the commonly adopted naming of `` post - starburst '' is in fact misleading . the exact duration , time elapsed and strength of the most recent star formation episode remains hard to constrain , in the absence of high s / n and high resolution spectra ( leonardi & rose 1996 ) . keeping this in mind ,",
    "in the following we will refer interchangebly to `` k+a '' or `` post - starburst '' spectra for convenience .",
    "first discovered in distant galaxy clusters over 25 years ago ( dressler & gunn 1983 ) , k+a galaxies have seen a renewed interest in recent years for a number of reasons .",
    "being galaxies in rapid transition from a blue , star - forming phase to a red , passively evolving phase , they were soon recognized to play an important role in the evolution of the star - forming fraction in galaxy clusters ( the so - called butcher - oemler effect , butcher & oemler 1984 ) , related to the transformation of spirals in distant clusters into the numerous s0 galaxies that dominate clusters today ( poggianti et al . 1999 , tran et al .",
    "more recently , it has been realized that the presence of k+a galaxies in environments other than clusters can contribute to the evolution of the red and blue galaxy fractions in any environment ( norton et al .",
    "2001 , tran et al .",
    "2004 , yan et al . 2008 ) . at redshifts above 1 ,",
    "k+a spectra may be a common feature of massive galaxies that formed most of their stars at high redshift ( doherty et al .",
    "2005 , van dokkum & ellis 2003 , van dokkum & stanford 2003 ) .",
    "post - starburst spectra are observed both in clusters and in the general field at all redshifts , but their incidence varies with redshift , environment and galaxy mass",
    ".    at intermediate redshifts ( @xmath4 ) , several spectroscopic surveys of galaxy clusters have reported large fractions of k+a spectra reaching up to 1/4 of the entire galaxy population in distant massive clusters ( dressler & gunn 1983 , couch & sharples 1987 , henry & lavery 1987 , fabricant et al .",

    "1999 , tran et al .",
    "2003 , 2004 , 2007 , swinbank et al .",
    "2007 ) . as is obvious , the computed k+a fraction depends on the adopted criteria for balmer and [ oii ] strengths , line measurement method and spectral quality . as",
    "a consequence , more significant than the absolute k+a fraction , is the relative fraction in different environments within the same study . in general",
    ", these studies have found that the frequency of k+a galaxies is significantly higher in clusters than in the field at intermediate redshifts ( e.g. dressler et al .",
    "1999 , tran et al .",
    "2004 ) , although this is not an universal conclusion : for example , balogh et al . ( 1999 ) argued for a similarly low k+a proportion in clusters and in the field at @xmath5 .",
    "low post - starburst fractions are found both in the field and in groups at @xmath6 from yan et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , who argued for a 2.5@xmath7 higher post - starburst fraction in the field than in groups .",
    "a cluster - related origin for a significant population of k+a s at intermediate redshifts is also supported by the analysis of the spatial distribution of galaxies with k+a spectra in a supercluster region at @xmath8 by ma et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , who found that k+a s occur within the cluster ram - pressure stripping radius and are essentially absent in the supercluster filamentary structure .    in the local universe ,",
    "k+a spectra are rare among bright galaxies in _ all _ environments . as a result , since clusters are rare objects , the majority of k+a galaxies at low - z , in number , reside in the field ( zabludoff et al .",
    "1996 , blake et al .",
    "2004 , hogg et al .",
    "2006 , goto 2007 ) .",
    "zabludoff et al .",
    "( 1996 ) were the first to note the rather common association of this type of spectra in the low - z field with signs of galaxy - galaxy interactions and mergers .",
    "other works have confirmed these findings , suggesting that the majority of field k+a s at low - z result from mergers that evolve into early - type galaxies ( yang et al .",
    "2004 , 2008 , goto 2005 , nolan et al . 2007 ) .",
    "their high merger rate is consistent with the high incidence of spectroscopically confirmed companions ( yamauchi et al .",
    "2008 ) and with the fact that they statistically prefer high local density regions at the scale of @xmath9 kpc ( goto 2005 ) .    in nearby clusters ,",
    "`` balmer - enhanced '' spectra were identified in several galaxies of the coma cluster ( caldwell et al .",
    "however , in the majority of these cases , the balmer lines were far weaker than those in distant clusters and poggianti et al .",
    "( 2004 ) concluded that luminous galaxies with post - starburst / post - starforming spectra are infrequent in coma .",
    "the latter study revealed a numerous population of fainter k+a galaxies ( @xmath10 ) , comprising @xmath11% of the cluster dwarfs .",
    "if coma ( the only local cluster studied in detail to date ) is representative of massive clusters locally , these results would imply that the evolution of the k+a luminosity distribution proceeds in a downsizing fashion ( poggianti et al .",
    ". the same mechanism may still give rise to cluster k+a s both at high- and low - z , if the maximum luminosity / mass of actively star - forming galaxies infalling onto clusters decreases at lower redshift .",
    "a striking correlation between the position of the youngest k+a galaxies and the substructure in the coma hot intracluster medium ( icm ) strongly suggests that the quenching of star formation is due to the interaction of galaxies in infalling groups with the shock fronts in the icm .",
    "several works based on the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) have used the local galaxy density to investigate the environment of k+a galaxies at low - z ( balogh et al .",
    "2005 , goto 2005 , hogg et al .",
    "2006 , nolan et al .",
    "2007 , yan et al . 2008 ) .",
    "they have unanimously found that low - z k+a s do not preferentially reside in high - density regions , and inferred from this that they do not preferentially belong to low - z clusters . however , as we will show , a low- and intermediate - density preference of k+a s does not necessarily imply residing outside of clusters . again from sdss , yan et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found a possibly double peaked density distribution of post - starburst galaxies , the strongest peak at the lowest densities sampled and a second peak at densities above average , suggesting two possible formation channels . still at low - z , hogg et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found only a small k+a excess inside the virial radii of clusters , and a slight excess with near neighbours , supporting the hypothesis that some k+a spectra are due to interactions with the intracluster medium .",
    "overall , although a detailed study of a large sample of nearby clusters is still lacking , the conclusion emerging from all low - z studies is that there is a paucity of bright , massive k+a galaxies in all environments , and a suggestive abundance of k+a faint galaxies in the one studied cluster . in contrast , at intermediate redshifts , most studies have measured significant fractions of bright k+a galaxies in clusters , and a higher fraction in clusters than in the field .",
    "it is fundamental to realize that several different physical processes can produce a k+a spectrum .",
    "any time star formation is truncated on a short timescale , a galaxy will experience a k+a phase .",
    "in different environments , different mechanisms may be , and very probably are , responsible for truncating star formation .",
    "the results obtained to date suggest that mergers may be the predominant mechanism in the low - z field , while the environmental dependence of k+a s at higher redshifts and the results in coma strongly point to cluster - related phenomena .",
    "other effects have been proposed , such as agn and supernovae quenching ( e.g. bekki et al .",
    "2001 , kaviraj et al . 2007 ) and massive dark matter halo formation ( birnboim et al .",
    "2007 ) . in clusters , besides the aforementioned impact of infalling galaxies with the icm shock fronts ( poggianti et al .",
    "2004 , crowl & kenney 2006 ) , other quenching mechanisms include ram pressure stripping ( gunn & gott 1972 , ma et al .",
    "2008 , vollmer 2008 ) , galaxy harassment ( moore et al .",
    "1996 , 1999 ) and tidal interactions ( koopmann & kenney 2004 , oemler et al .",
    "2008 , see also treu et al .",
    "2003 and boselli & gavazzi 2006 for reviews of cluster processes ) .",
    "k+a s are not the only balmer - strong type of spectra . emission - line spectra with exceptionally strong balmer lines in absorption ( e(a ) spectra ) were identified in large numbers at intermediate redshifts , both in clusters and in the field ( dressler et al .",
    "1999 , poggianti et al .",
    "1999 ) . at low - z",
    ", this type of spectra are associated with ongoing starbursts whose young stellar populations are strongly obscured by dust .",
    "in fact , they are rare among local normal spirals , but common among dusty starbursts and luminous infrared galaxies ( liu & kennicutt 1995 , poggianti & wu 2000 ) . and low @xmath12 ) and have _ suppressed _ star formation levels and high dust obscuration ( wolf et al .",
    "2007 ) . ] an e(a ) spectrum can be produced if the o and b stars causing the emission lines are highly obscured by dust and the older a - type stars ",
    "responsible for the strong balmer absorption  have had time to free themselves or drift away from their dusty cocoons ( poggianti et al .",
    "1999 ) . on average , younger stellar generations",
    "are more strongly obscured than older ones , and this phenomenon is often referred to as `` selective extinction '' . as a result of this effect ,",
    "the strongest starbursts locally have only weak to moderate emission lines ( due to high extinction ) , and have usually e(a ) spectra , _ not _ spectra with the strongest emission lines .",
    "spectrophotometric modeling of e(a ) galaxies has confirmed both the adequacy and the necessity of selective extinction and of an ongoing starburst to explain simultaneously the optical spectral characteristics and the fir fluxes of local e(a ) galaxies ( poggianti , bressan & franceschini 2001 , shioya et al .",
    "2001 , bekki et al .",
    "mid - ir isocam ( duc et al . 2002 ) and spitzer ( dressler et al . 2008 ) studies have confirmed that statistically e(a ) galaxies at @xmath13 have the highest sfrs , and that they are experiencing an increase in sfr compared to their past average ( dressler et al .",
    "2008 ) .    from the optical point of view",
    ", the only difference between k+a and e(a ) spectra is the presence of emission lines .",
    "if the scenario outlined above is correct , however , the two spectral classes correspond to fundamentally different phases of star formation activity : post - starburst the k+a s , and ongoing dusty starburst the e(a ) s .",
    "an evolutionary link between the two types of galaxies can occur , with e(a ) s being in some cases the progenitors of some of the k+a galaxies ( poggianti et al .",
    "1999 , balogh et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "the association between spectral class and star formation history in these two classes works well in a statistical sense , but the demarcation between the two histories is not straightforward in all galaxies and several caveats need to be kept in mind .",
    "both radio ( smail et al . 1999 ) and mid - ir ( dressler et al . 2008 ) observations have found that some k+a galaxies may host a residual ongoing star formation activity , highly obscured by dust and therefore not visible in the [ oii ] line .",
    "these works show that k+a galaxies with ongoing sf are a minority and that the residual sfr is significantly lower than the sfr during the previous burst ( dressler et al .",
    "2008 ) . moreover , the separation between k+a s and e(a ) s is commonly set to a low ew of emission lines ( usually 5 @xmath14 in [ oii ] ) that is determined by the standard detection limit in distant spectroscopic surveys .",
    "this limit is necessarily arbitrary : lower or upper detection limits can result in a different mixing between the two classes .",
    "the lines used in the classification and the adopted limits for their strength vary significantly in the literature and this obviously hinders the comparison between different works and with the existing modeling .",
    "any adopted choice of line combination leads to some level of bias , incompleteness and possible misclassification between k+a s and e(a ) s .",
    "for example , the use of the @xmath15 line in emission has been strongly advocated as a substitute of [ oii ] by yan et al .",
    "( 2006 ) to avoid incompleteness in the post - starburst sample due to agn - dropouts . in terms of the @xmath16-based classification ,",
    "it is still unclear how post - starbursts can be separated from ongoing dusty starbursts .",
    "furthermore , e(a ) spectra are sometimes refereed to as  post - starbursts in the literature ( eg . tremonti et al .",
    "2007 , see also le borgne et al .",
    "2006 ) , because the association between strong balmer lines and a post - starburst history is common knowledge in the astronomical community , unlike the association between balmer lines and ongoing starbursts .",
    "of course it remains possible that some e(a ) s are truly post - starburst systems whose lines in emission are due to a small residual star formation activity ( poggianti et al .",
    "finally , spectrophotometric modeling with selective extinction shows that regular star formation histories can account for e(a ) spectra at @xmath17 , depending on the timescale of the star formation decline , without the need to invoke a starburst ( fritz & poggianti in prep . ) .",
    "regardless of the intrinsic caveats in the spectral interpretation on a galaxy - by - galaxy basis , the simultaneous study of emission and balmer features is the primary source of information to unveil the recent star formation history of galaxies observed by spectroscopic surveys : identifying k+a and e(a ) spectra allows to recognize strong variations of the star formation activity ( a truncation or a burst ) , and to study how they change with @xmath18 and environment . in this paper , we investigate the occurrence and properties of post - starburst galaxies and dusty starburst candidates at @xmath0 .",
    "we make use of the eso distant cluster survey dataset (  2 ) , adopt the spectral classification described in  3 and consider different environments : clusters , groups and the field , as defined in  4 .",
    "we show how the proportion of post - starburst galaxies and dusty starburst candidates depends on environment (  5 ) and how it varies in clusters with the cluster properties (  5.2 ) .",
    "we next consider composite spectra as an alternative tool to study the environmental dependence of star formation histories (  6 ) .",
    "we present the detailed properties of galaxies of different spectral types : their morphologies (  7.1 ) , masses , luminosities and mass - to - light ratios (  7.2 ) , local density and radial distributions (  7.3 ) .",
    "finally , in  8 we summarize our results and discuss the implications for the origin and the evolution of post - starburst galaxies . in the appendix , we search for spectroscopic evidence of galactic winds in our balmer strong population .    in the following ,",

    "the visual inspection of each spectrum alleviates significantly this problem , in two ways : a ) the comparison between the 1d and 2d spectrum provides a reliable detection / non - detection of even weak emission and b ) the visual assessment of the quality of the balmer measurement in most cases is able to distinguish noisy or problematic ( due e.g. to sky lines ) measurements of @xmath12 from reliable line detections and measurements . our classification is therefore based both on the ew limits given in  3 , and on the visual assessment of the quality of the @xmath12 strength and its confirmation by the strength of the higher order balmer lines . when a spectral type could not be reliably determined , a `` ? ' ' -type was assigned ( table  3 ) . similarly ,",
    "if the balmer strength could not be reliably measured in an emission - line spectrum , an `` e''-class was assigned ( table  3 ) .",
    "the robustness of the spectral classification is confirmed by the fact that repeated observations with a securely assigned spectral type always yielded the same spectral classification .",
    "moreover , we performed a test on the differences between the two spectral classes that in principle are most prone to misclassification between each other , i.e. the k and k+a spectra .",

    "the reliability of the k+a classification is particularly important in order to avoid a `` spillage '' from the k into the k+a class due to noisy measurements .",
    "the spectral visual assessment , coupled with the quality of the spectra , is especially useful to eliminate spurious cases and select a reliable k+a sample . as we will show later in the paper , the reality of the differences between our k and the k+a galaxies is testified , a posteriori , by their different morphological and clustercentric radial distributions .",

    "this has two main implications .",
    "first of all , these results highlight , once more , the differences in the galaxy populations of groups of similar velocity dispersion , but different [ oii ] content .",
    "we have noted before that the properties of galaxies in low-[oii ] groups resemble those in the cores of far more massive clusters , in terms of their fractions of passively evolving and early - type galaxies , their [ oii ] ew distribution ( poggianti et al .",
    "2006 ) and their steep relation between average star - forming fraction and local galaxy density ( poggianti et al . 2008 ) .",
    "we now find that these systems are similar to more massive clusters also for the conspicuousness of their post - starburst population .",
    "in contrast , high-[oii ] groups of similar masses appear to be the least - favourable environment for the production of post - starburst galaxies .",
    "second , post - starburst galaxies are observed for the first time to occur in significant proportions also in a subset of the groups , while so far , at @xmath17 , they were believed to be a phenomenon related principally to massive clusters . as discussed in  1",
    ", previous work found a low k+a fraction in the general field and a high k+a fraction in clusters at @xmath61 .",
    "intermediate and low - mass clusters and groups at these redshifts had not been studied in detail to date .",
    "hints of a sizeable post - starburst population in low - z groups were found by zabludoff & mulchaey ( 1998 ) .",
    "our result shows that a mechanism switching off star formation on a short timescale must operate efficiently also in _ some _ ( but not all ) groups .",
    "we note that the k+a fraction computed over all groups ( low- and high-[oii ] groups together ) is low , of the order of that computed in the field ( see line `` all groups '' in the tables ) .",
    "this might explain the recent result of yan et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , reporting low k+a fractions in the deep2 field and groups at @xmath34 and a 2.5@xmath7 higher fraction in the field than in groups .",
    "given the different environment and post - starburst definitions , a straight comparison can not be performed , but their group sample is likely dominated by a combination of our poor groups , high-[oii ] groups and low-[oii ] groups : our poor group and overall group k+a fractions ( e.g. 0.03 and 0.05 , respectively , see table  4 ) and field fractions ( 0.06 ) are probably qualitatively consistent with their result .    it is also of note that the k+a fraction we observe in clusters is significantly lower than that measured by the morphs collaboration , the only previous large spectroscopic survey of several distant clusters at redshifts similar to ours ( dressler et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the morphs work has the same ew measurement method and spectral classification , and similar spectral quality , galaxy magnitude and radial limits of the present work , therefore a direct comparison is appropriate . in 10 clusters at @xmath61 ,",

    "1999 ) , which is approximately twice the value we observe in ediscs . in the following ,",
    "the analysis of the detailed cluster properties will shed light on the origin of the different k+a incidence in the two samples (  5.2 ) .",
    "the conclusions discussed above are valid both for the magnitude - limited and mass - limited samples .",
    "figure  [ pi ] and tables  3 ,  4 and  5 also show that the environments with the highest k+a fraction ( i.e. clusters and low-[oii ] groups ) are those with the highest fraction of passively evolving ( k ) galaxies , and lowest fractions of actively star - forming ( emission - line ) galaxies . at @xmath0 , those environments that host",
    "few currently star - forming galaxies are also efficiently truncating star formation in them .      each galaxy in our sample",
    "is observed in one of three main evolutionary phases : while it is passively evolving ( k / k(e ) ) , recently star - forming ( k+a ) or currently star - forming ( any of the emission - line classes ) .",
    "it is useful to examine the incidence of post - starburst galaxies within the `` active '' population , defined to include k+a galaxies and galaxies of all emission - line types .",
    "the active population represents the population of galaxies that were all star - forming @xmath63 gyr before the epoch of observation .",
    "hence , the k+a / active fraction can be considered a sort of `` quenching efficiency '' : the efficiency of a given environment in truncating star formation in star - forming galaxies , which have presumably been recently accreted by the cluster .",
    "the environmental variations of the star formation histories are even more striking when considering the spectral fractions relative to the active population instead of the fractions in the entire cluster population .",
    "the k+a / active fractions are listed in table  6 and shown in fig .",
    "[ histo ] for the various ediscs environments .",
    "post - starburst galaxies represent 20% to 30% of the active galaxy populations in ediscs clusters and low-[oii ] groups , while they compose only less than 10% of the active galaxies in the other environments .",
    "the same table shows also a comparison with the morphs cluster and field results at @xmath61 .",
    "the k+a / active incidence is even higher in morphs than in ediscs clusters ( 40% versus 23% ) , and it is equal in the ediscs and morphs field ( 9% ) .",
    "considering now the dusty starburst candidates , table  6 lists both the e(a)/active fraction and the fraction of e(a ) s relative to the number of emission - line galaxies with an assigned spectral type ( the sum of e(a ) s , e(a)+ s , e(c ) s and e(b ) s ) .",
    "the e(a)/emission fraction , graphically displayed in fig .",

    "previous works ( poggianti et al . 1999 , dressler et al . 1999 , 2004 , 2008 ) observed a high frequency of e(a ) galaxies both in clusters and in the field at @xmath61 , suggesting that the presence of a dusty starburst is not caused by the cluster environment ( see also ma et al .",
    "table  6 shows that the e(a)/active and e(a)/emission fractions observed in the ediscs and morphs clusters and field are very similar .    besides confirming the ubiquity of e(a ) spectra in all environments at @xmath0",
    ", we find that the highest e(a ) frequency is observed in groups ( @xmath64% of the star - forming galaxies ) , while lower fractions ( 20% to 30% of the star - forming galaxies ) are observed in clusters , poor groups and the field .",
    "interestingly , the e(a)/emission fraction is high in _ all types _ of groups , being similarly high in low- and high-[oii ] groups .",
    "groups with @xmath65 are therefore the most favourable environment for triggering an e(a ) spectrum .",
    "the frequency of dusty starburst candidates in groups could be related to the high incidence of mergers expected in these environments .",
    "the results presented so far highlight the strong environmental dependence of the frequency of k+a spectra , and a milder but noticeable variation in the proportion of dusty starburst candidates with environment .",
    "it is worth noting that even in a mass - limited sample the different mix of star formation histories in the various environments could arise from a different distribution of galaxy masses with environment ( see poggianti et al .",
    "2008 ) . in order to test",
    "whether our results are driven by this effect , we constructed a mass - matched sample , drawing , for each cluster galaxy , a galaxy of similar mass in each of the other environments .",
    "all conclusions presented in this section remain unchanged : strong environmental variations in the spectral fractions persist in the mass - matched samples .",
    "hence , variations in the galaxy mass distribution are not responsible for the observed variations in spectral fractions with environment .",
    "galaxies of similar masses must present significantly different star formation histories depending on environment .",
    "in  5.0 and 5.1 we have shown that the fractions of post - starburst and , to a smaller extent , of dusty starburst candidates depend on the global environment , when environment is subdivided into clusters , different types of groups , poor groups and the field . to investigate whether the star formation histories depend on the cluster and group properties in more detail , we now examine how the spectral fractions depend on the velocity dispersion of the system .",

    "a summary view of the trends with @xmath7 is shown in fig .",

    "this figure shows how , on average , the k+a fractions in non - outliers correlate with @xmath7 .",
    "it is useful to keep in mind that this is an average trend , while the scatter for individual clusters can be appreciated in fig .",
    "[ kafrac ] , where for example a few intermediate - mass clusters with a null k+a fraction are visible .",
    "figure  [ kafrac2 ] also visualizes the fact that , while the average fractions in high-[oii ] groups are compatible with the field and poor group values , the other environments have average k+a fractions higher than the field / poor groups .",
    "in contrast to k+a s , neither the e(a)/all , nor the e(a)/active , nor the e(a)/emission fractions , even just for non - outliers , depend on velocity dispersion ( see fig .  [ eafrac ] ) .",
    "hence , while the `` quenching efficiency '' depends on the cluster properties , the incidence of dusty starburst candidates among all and among active galaxies does not .",
    "the trend of the post - starburst fractions with velocity dispersion is a remarkable result , that could not be investigated in previous studies due to the limited cluster mass range explored .",
    "it is worth noting that the correlation of the post - starburst fraction with cluster mass is likely to be the cause of the differences in the global spectral fractions for ediscs and morphs clusters that were discussed in  5 ( see fig .  [ kafrac ] and table  6 ) .",
    "the ediscs sample includes clusters as massive as those in the morphs sample , but also a number of lower mass systems .",
    "therefore , the `` average '' ediscs cluster has a lower mass than the `` average '' morphs cluster , and this is reflected in the lower global k+a fraction in ediscs clusters .",
    "the observed trends of the k+a fractions with @xmath7 raise two main questions :    \\1 ) why are more massive systems progressively more efficient in quenching star formation ( the k+a / active fraction ) .",
    "\\2 ) what physical conditions and/or structure history set the outliers apart from the other systems , and cause them to quench star formation with a higher efficiency than other systems of their mass .",
    "these questions will be addressed in  8 , after having gathered additional observational clues .",

    "the hypothesis that the observed and the simulated distributions are drawn from the same parent distribution .",
    "these simple tests show that the mere definitions of the plotted quantities is not sufficient to explain the observed distribution of points , suggesting a physical origin for the link between the frequency of the various spectral classes .    to investigate such an origin , we ran a third simulation , starting from the observed distribution of @xmath72 as measured by poggianti et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . in this work",
    ", the @xmath72 fraction was found to follow a general broad anticorrelation with cluster velocity dispersion , although with a number of outliers .",
    "for the galaxies determined to be non - emission line galaxies in each cluster we then randomly determine whether they are k+a galaxies , adopting a 30% probability that any one of the non - emission line galaxies is a k+a .",
    "results are shown as blue open triangles in fig .",
    "[ kaoii ] and are compatible with the trends observed in both panels . for this third case ,",
    "kolmogorov - smirnov tests allow the observed and the simulated distributions to be drawn from the same parent distribution ( the ks probabilities for the distributions _ not _ to be drawn from the same parent distribution are 0.109 and 0.703 ) .    assuming a constant k+a probability _ among non - emission - line galaxies _ ( 0.3 in the third simulation ) physically means a higher k+a production rate _ per emission - line galaxy _ in systems with lower star - forming fractions .",
    "in fact , it is important to keep in mind that the population of emission - line galaxies is the `` reservoir '' to produce k+a s , thus a fixed k+a probability among non - emission - line galaxies corresponds to adopting a higher conversion efficiency from emission - line to k+a in systems with lower star - forming fractions .",
    "therefore , the anticorrelation in fig",
    ".  [ kaoii ] might point to a connection between the `` quenching efficiency '' and the fraction of cluster galaxies that still retain an ongoing star formation activity or , equivalently , the fraction of cluster galaxies that are devoid of star formation ( 1-f([oii ] ) .",
    "naively , this connection seems to imply that the observed proportion of passively evolving galaxies in a system depends directly on the capacity of the cluster / group to truncate the star formation activity in currently infalling galaxies . assuming that the sf activity , once quenched , does not re - start at later times , this result is perhaps unsurprising if environments that are good at quenching at the moment we observe them have been good at quenching also at previous times , even if the quenching mechanism may not be the same over time . attempting an interpretation of the observed anticorrelation , however , requires an articulated model for the accretion and quenching history of clusters , that is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "composite cluster spectra can be obtained combining the light of individual galaxies .",

    "these represent mixes of different proportions of passive and quiescently star - forming galaxies , which are supposed to represent the field at different z s and to follow the variation in the star - forming fraction with redshift .",

    "stellar mass , absolute v magnitude and stellar mass - to - light ratio distributions of galaxies of different spectral types are shown in fig .  [ masses ] .",
    "as it is natural to expect on the basis of what has been shown above and in previous works , the spectral classification is also a sequence of decreasing average galaxy mass and decreasing mass - to - light ratio going from k / k(e ) , k+a , e(c ) , e(a)/e(a)+ to e(b ) types .",
    "the absolute magnitude distribution , instead , is more uniform across spectral types , except for e(b ) galaxies that are the least massive , but also the least luminous , class .",
    "this strengthens some of the conclusions found by previous works , and provides some new insights :    \\a ) strong emission - line ( e(b ) ) galaxies are not the primary progenitors of k+a galaxies , being significantly less massive than k+a s ( poggianti et al .",
    "the obvious candidate progenitors of the bright / massive k+a s included in our sample are star - forming galaxies of the e(a ) , e(a)+ and e(c ) types .",
    "\\b ) since the stellar mass distributions of k and k+a galaxies are rather similar , the fate of the observed k+a s ( assuming they never resume a star formation activity ) is to increment the class of massive , passively evolving k galaxies . given also their morphologies (  7.1 ) , k+a s are massive galaxies in the transition phase from actively starbursting or star - forming disk galaxies to passively evolving early - type galaxies .",
    "this scenario has been proposed and discussed before in several works ( e.g. poggianti et al .",
    "1999 ) , although galaxy masses were not available then .",
    "\\c ) if this scenario can explain the evolution with redshift of galaxy properties ( star formation activity and morphologies ) in clusters and , as we now find , in the low-[oii ] groups , the paucity or even lack of k+a galaxies in other environments leads to the question of whether / how galaxies turn from blue actively star - forming to red passively evolving in high-[oii ] groups , poor groups and the field . currently it is unknown how to what extent the observed strong evolution of the number ratio of red to blue galaxies on a cosmic scale ( e.g. bell et al .",
    "2007 ) can be accounted for by the presence of k+a galaxies in the different environments and , conversely , how many galaxies in each environment turn from blue to red without going through a k+a phase .",
    "it is hard to assess quantitatively the impact of k+a galaxies on the cosmic star formation , not knowing the relative proportion of low-[oii ] and high-[oii ] groups , and what fraction of all galaxies could be processed through the low-[oii ] group environment .",
    "the location of galaxies of different spectral types within the cluster may provide some clues about the physical cause for the spectral characteristics and , therefore , the star formation pattern .",
    "distributions of projected local density for galaxies in our clusters and groups are shown in fig.[den ] for each spectral class .",
    "the local galaxy density was computed within the circular area enclosing the closest 10 neighbours , as described in poggianti et al .",
    "e(a ) , e(a)+ and e(b ) galaxies are rare in regions of densities higher than 100 galaxies/@xmath74 .",
    "the same is true for the youngest k+a galaxies ( solid histogram ) , identified as those with the strongest balmer lines and blue colors ( r.f .",
    "@xmath75 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) , that tend to inhabit , on average , lower density regions than the general k+a population .",
    "even more significant is to look at the incidence of post - starbursts and dusty starburst candidates among the active population as a function of local density ( fig .",
    "[ den2 ] ) .",
    "the overall k+a / active and k+a / all fractions are rather flat with density , except for a possible peak at the lowest densities we sample . isolating the youngest k+a s ( shaded histogram in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ den2 ] ) , their incidence tends to _ increase _ towards _ lower _ densities . a similar trend with local overdensity",
    "is reported by yan et al.(2008 ) for the deep2 galaxy redshift survey at @xmath78 .",
    "an opposite trend with local density has been instead found by ma et al .",
    "( 2008 ) in a cluster at @xmath79 .",
    "our histogram shows that a preference for underdense regions does not necessarily imply that k+a s occur preferentially outside clusters : all our young k+a s shown in fig .",
    "[ den2 ] reside in massive ediscs clusters .",
    "this trend with local density is compatible for example with k+a s occurring at the edge of infalling structures , where they first encounter the turbulent icm .",
    "this scenario is also consistent with the clustercentric distance distribution of k+a s shown below .",
    "interestingly , the k+a / active trend with density is paralleled by the e(a)/active fraction that is consistent with a mild decrease with density ( right panel in fig .",
    "[ den2 ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the e(c)/active fraction has the opposite trend , and sharply increases towards the highest densities .",
    "finally , we consider the distribution of clustercentric radial projected distance of galaxies of different spectral types .",
    "figure [ cum ] shows the cumulative radial distribution in units of virial radii .",
    "the virial radius was computed as @xmath80 ( biviano et al .",
    "2006 and biviano 2007 private communication ) .",
    "the distribution of all emission - line galaxies is shown in the left panel and contrasted with the distributions of k and k+a galaxies .",
    "the single emission - line classes are shown in the right panel .",
    "the star formation sequence corresponds to a progressive shift in radial distributions : the oldest ( k ) galaxies are the most centrally concentrated , the recently star - forming ( k+a ) are less concentrated than k s and the currently star - forming ( emission line types ) galaxies are the least concentrated , as found before e.g. by dressler et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and moran et al .",
    "the distribution of emission - line galaxies differs from that of k and k+a galaxies at the 99.9% and 99.2% level , respectively .",
    "e(c ) s seem to be the most centrally concentrated and e(b ) s the least concentrated among emission - line galaxies , although numbers are too small for the differences among the various emission types to be statistically significant .",
    "the radial distributions of galaxies within the cluster are consistent with a scenario in which the longer a galaxy has been inside a cluster , the longer ago was its star formation terminated and the longer is the time it has had to dynamically relax within the cluster potential .",
    "the projected local density distributions show a tendency for young k+a galaxies to be located in low density cluster regions , as some of their most likely progenitors : e(a ) galaxies .",
    "in this paper we have found that the incidence of k+a ( post - starburst ) galaxies at intermediate redshifts depends strongly on environment . k+a galaxies at @xmath0 preferentially reside in clusters and , unexpectedly , in a subset of the groups , those with a low-[oii ] fraction . in these environments",
    ", the star formation activity is truncated on a short timescale ( @xmath81 gyr ) in a large fraction ( 20 to 30% ) of the recently star - forming population .    in constrast , there are proportionally fewer or even no k+a galaxies in other environments , namely the field , the poor groups and the groups with a high [ oii ] fraction .",
    "these results are based on the observed variation of the fractions of different spectral types with environment and are confirmed by the study of cluster and group integrated composite spectra .    the quenching efficiency  measured as the ratio between the number of k+a galaxies and the number of galaxies with an ongoing or recent star formation activity  correlates with velocity dispersion .",
    "more massive systems have thus higher proportions of k+a galaxies , and higher quenching efficiencies .    in addition , low-[oii ] systems , characterized by a low-[oii ] fraction for their mass , display an excess of k+a galaxies compared to other systems of similar mass .",
    "moreover , all systems follow a tight anticorrelation between the k+a / active galaxy fraction and the fraction of [ oii ] emitters .",
    "this anticorrelation could imply that the number of passively evolving galaxies in a cluster is closely linked with the number of recently quenched galaxies .",
    "dusty starburst candidates present a very different environmental dependence from post - starburst galaxies .",
    "they are numerous in all environments at @xmath0 , representing at least 20% of the star - forming population , but they are especially numerous among star - forming galaxies in both low-[oii ] and high-[oii ] groups , where they represent 45% of the emission - line spectra ( table  6 ) .",
    "this favors the hypothesis that a dusty starburst can be triggered by mergers , that are expected to be common in groups .",
    "since dusty starburst candidates are present in similar proportions of the star - forming population in high- and low-[oii ] groups , while k+a galaxies are present only in the latter type of groups , it is reasonable to conclude that the star formation enhancement and the truncation of the star formation are not necessarily associated phenomena and are caused by different processes : the e(a ) phase is not necessarily followed by a k+a phase .",
    "the spectral classification scheme , from passively evolving ( k ) to post - starburst ( k+a ) , to quiescently star - forming ( e(c ) ) to starbursts and starburst candidates ( e(a ) , e(a)+ and e(b ) ) is also a sequence of progressively later morphological types , lower galaxy stellar masses and lower mass - to - light ratios .",
    "we confirm that the properties of k+a galaxies are consistent with them being observed in a transition phase , at the moment they are rather massive s0s and sa galaxies , presumably evolving from star - forming later types into passively evolving early - type galaxies .",
    "we also confirm that the clustercentric radial distribution is consistent with this evolutionary connection between the different types .",
    "interestingly , the observed frequency of k+a s shows no preference for the highest density regions .",
    "in fact , the incidence of young k+a s suggests there is a higher k+a production rate towards the low density regions within the cluster and group virial radius , although the number of galaxies is too low to draw definite conclusions .",
    "the most important and puzzling of our results are the high incidence of k+a galaxies in some of the groups and the fact that the quenching efficiency appears to increase with cluster velocity dispersion .",
    "a possibility to be contemplated is that the velocity dispersions of the [ oii ] outliers are severely underestimated .",
    "this is rather unlikely , for a number of reasons .",
    "first of all , they would have to be extremely underestimated , and to be aligned with the rest of the systems in the k+a fraction versus @xmath7 relation , groups with @xmath82 should be clusters with @xmath83 .",
    "the velocity dispersions of these systems are based on a significant number of spectroscopically confirmed members ( 17 in the case of cl1119 , 24 for cl1420 , for example ) and therefore have rather small formal errors .",
    "moreover , a sparse spectroscopic sampling usually leads to _ overestimate _ , not underestimate , the @xmath7 .",
    "the weak lensing mass estimates do not accomodate such large masses either ( clowe et al .",
    "2006 , milvang - jensen et al .",
    "a severely underestimated mass is even harder to be explained in the case of the two morphs outliers ( crosses in fig .",
    "2 ) , that already have @xmath84 and that to align with the rest of the clusters should have @xmath85 .",
    "overall , it is hard to see how significantly larger masses could go undetected in the low-[oii ] systems , although this is a possibility that we can not exclude for certain and awaits further observational investigation .    assuming that the measured velocity dispersions of the [ oii ] outliers are representative of their masses , we are left with two main questions :    \\a ) what are the physical mechanisms that truncate star formation in these systems and in the other environments ?",
    "\\b ) why do groups of similar masses divide in two subgroups having respectively a quenching efficiency as high as those in clusters ( the low-[oii ] groups ) and a null quenching efficiency ( the high-[oii groups ) ?    in the following",
    "we attempt to delineate a working hypothesis , on the basis of our and previous results .",
    "the fact that the quenching efficiency increases with cluster velocity dispersion ( fig .",
    "2 ) can be easily explained if the truncation is due to the intracluster medium .",
    "ram pressure stripping becomes more efficient in more massive clusters and the density gradients at the shock fronts of infalling structures should become steeper .",
    "this hypothesis is in agreement with previous evidence for a link between k+a s and the hot intracluster medium in massive clusters ( poggianti et al .",
    "2004 , moran et al .",
    "2007 , ma et al . 2008 ) .",
    "theoretical calculations of ram pressure stripping through a static , smooth intracluster medium find this to be effective only in the cores of the most massive clusters .",
    "however , observations of stripped galaxies ( eg . kenney et al .",
    "2004 , vollmer et al . 2006 ) where stripping is not expected to be efficient clearly challenge this simplistic theoretical picture .",
    "recent theoretical models have started to investigate more realistic conditions in cluster outskirts , groups , filaments and in the presence of galaxy tidal interactions , and to assess the effects ot icm turbulence , icm subsctructure and shocks during groups infall , finding that ram pressure can occur out to the cluster virial radius ( tonnesen , bryan & van gorkom 2007 , tonnesen & bryan 2008 , kapferer et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "at this point it is appropriate to wonder if an icm origin can accomodate the fact that bright k+a s are numerous in distant massive clusters and rare in low - z massive clusters .",
    "the evolution of bright cluster k+a s can be understood considering the evolution of the infalling star - forming population .",
    "clusters at @xmath86 with @xmath87 have about 20% of their galaxies that are star - forming ( poggianti et al .",
    "2006 ) , as opposed to an average @xmath88% in intermediate - z clusters ( table  4 , see also poggianti et al .",
    "2006 for the evolution of the star - forming fraction as a function of cluster mass ) .",
    "a quenching efficiency similar to that in distant clusters ( 23% , table  6 ) would imply a global k+a fraction at @xmath86 of less than 5% ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "a low k+a fraction at low - z can therefore be explained as the result of a reduced `` fuel stream '' ( rate of star - forming infalling galaxies ) , even if the quenching efficiency remains similar to that in distant clusters as expected if it is driven by the icm .",
    "such high quenching efficiency is also able to account for the large number of faint k+a s in a cluster like coma : the `` fuel '' of star - forming galaxies is high at @xmath86 at the magnitudes of dwarf galaxies , due to the downsizing effect .",
    "we find the quenching efficiency to be comparable in clusters and low-[oii ] groups .",
    "either the same physical mechanism or two different mechanisms must be at work in these two environments . for the mechanism to be unique and",
    "be related to the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , if one assumes that the trend of k+a s with @xmath7 traces the `` standard '' trend of igm with @xmath7 , the low-[oii ] systems ought to have an unusually dense medium for their mass . in this case",
    ", the major difference between low-[oii ] and high-[oii ] groups of similar masses would be the presence / lack of this dense medium .",
    "indeed 3 out of 4 of the x - ray luminous groups with @xmath90 observed at intermediate redshift by jeltema et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have low-[oii ] fractions that are comparable to our outliers , but 1 out of the 4 exhibits a rather high [ oii ] fraction , intermediate between that of our low- and high-[oii ] groups .",
    "x - ray selected groups were also found to have an overall low-[oii ] content at @xmath91 by balogh et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . on the other hand , the emission - line fractions _ inferred from the morphological mix _ ( and therefore highly uncertain ) in low - z groups detected in x - ray would qualify several of these as probable high-[oii ] systems ( zabludoff & mulchaey 1998 , mulchaey et al .",
    "2003 ) . in the gems sample at low - z ,",
    "osmond & ponman ( 2004 ) find that the fraction of spirals is anticorrelated with the x - ray temperature with a large scatter , although they also find it correlates with velocity dispersion .",
    "therefore , these observations do not provide an explanation for the different [ oii ] content at similar @xmath7 as we observe .",
    "that different star formation properties in our two types of groups are due to different igm properties is in principle a viable explanation , but entirely speculative based on our current observations .",
    "x - ray observations of large samples of groups with different [ oii ] content are necessary to study the relation between igm properties and star formation .    alternatively , the high quenching efficiency of low-[oii ] groups could be due to processes unrelated to the igm .",
    "the most obvious candidate mechanisms are tidal effects , due to tidal stripping , close galaxy interactions or mergers . in this case ,",
    "low-[oii ] groups could be bound objects in which tidal interactions are very effective , while high-[oii ] `` groups '' could be in fact systems of galaxies , for example in filaments , that have not yet collapsed into a virialized system . in this context , however , it is harder to understand why the e(a)/active fraction is so similar in these two types of systems , unless this fraction is unrelated to mergers .",
    "if the e(a)/active fraction is related to mergers at some level , then it remains unclear why the subsequent evolution involves a truncation of star formation only in low-[oii ] groups .",
    "combinations of different processes can of course be at work : a merger+starburst in all types of groups could largely exhaust the gas and the latter could not be replenished only in those ( presumably low-[oii ] ) systems where the hot gas reservoir has been stripped by the igm , either because the density of the igm is higher or because the effects of the igm are enhanced by the merging of different subgroups .",
    "the igm properties may also depend on the agn activity history of the group , including powerful jets triggered in radio - loud quasars when two supermassive black holes coalesce ( rawlings & jarvis 2004 ) .",
    "the only thing that appears clear is that different physical ( e.g. igm or bound / unbound ) conditions , or a different growth history and dynamical status ( recent subgroup merging ) must occur in groups with velocity dispersions in the range @xmath92 , rendering some of them efficient in suddenly quenching star formation and some not .",
    "this may be connected with the large scatter in star formation properties observed in groups at low - z ( poggianti et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "we now turn to the origin of k+a galaxies in the field and poor groups .",
    "observational evidence for a merger origin in the general `` field '' at intermediate redshifts , and a non - merger origin in clusters at similar redshifts , was obtained by tran et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and ( 2004 ) .",
    "the evidence for mergers in distant field k+a s resembles the merger signatures observed in local field k+a s ( zabludoff et al .",
    "1996 , yang et al .",
    "2004 , 2008 ) .",
    "a merger could , at least temporarily , exhaust in a short time the available gas and thus give rise to a k+a spectrum . within our dataset ,",
    "k+a field galaxies with hst imaging are too few for a statistical analysis of merger occurrence .",
    "it is of course also possible that the field and poor group galaxies that we observe are in fact in unidentified low-[oii ] groups .    finally , following the discovery of galactic winds in balmer - strong galaxies at @xmath93 in the sdss ( tremonti et al .",
    "2007 ) , we have looked for evidence for massive gas outflows from our spectra",
    ". some of the processes discussed above could give rise to such a massive outflow .",
    "for example , a strong starburst or feedback from a powerful agn phase , triggered by the merging of gas - rich galaxies , could truncate star formation and produce a k+a spectrum .",
    "as described in detail in the appendix below , we find no spectroscopic evidence for such winds in the subset of galaxies with similar balmer properties as those in tremonti et al .",
    "we note , however , that our conclusion is limited to e(a ) galaxies , because only one of our k+a spectra extends to sufficiently blue wavelengths for this analysis , and therefore we can not exclude the presence of recent strong outflows in k+a galaxies .",

    "evidence for galactic winds in these galaxies comes from the @xmath141 lines that are blueshifted by as much as @xmath142 with respect to the stars .",
    "a large mass of outflowing gas can be an efficient method for expelling the galactic gas and terminate the star formation activity .",
    "the end of the star formation in this case would be related to a phenomenom intrinsic to the galaxy itself such as an agn .",
