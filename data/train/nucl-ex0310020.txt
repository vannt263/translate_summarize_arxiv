    "these ultra - peripheral collisions ( upcs ) can be divided into two classes , purely electromagnetic interactions ( two - photon ) and photonuclear interactions , where a photon from the field of one nucleus interacts with the other nucleus .",
    "we focus on the region @xmath3 to exclude hadronic contamination",
    ". we will present 3 topics which have been studied by the solenoidal tracker at rhic ( star ) collaboration : vector meson production , vector meson interferometry , and @xmath0 pair production .",
    "vector mesons are produced when a photon from the field of one nucleus fluctuates to a @xmath4 pair ( virtual vector meson ) , which then scatters elastically from the other nucleus , emerging as a vector meson @xcite , as is shown in fig .",

    "heavy mesons come from small dipoles with small interaction cross sections .",
    "production is distributed evenly throughout the target , and @xmath7 .",
    "for sufficiently heavy mesons like the @xmath8 , the elastic scattering may be described in terms of multiple gluon exchange .",
    "the cross section is sensitive to gluon shadowing in nuclei @xcite .",
    "large dipoles ( light mesons ) interact with a large cross section with the first nucleon that they encounter .",
    "the interaction is on the surface of the target , so @xmath9 .",
    "the exact scaling can be determined by a glauber calculation @xcite ; for the @xmath5 , the scaling is roughly @xmath10 .",
    "[ diagram ]    the large photon flux and the coherent scattering lead to a large cross section for @xmath5 production . for 200 gev per nucleon au - au collisions at rhic ,",
    "the cross section for @xmath5 production is 590 mb , or about 8% of the hadronic cross section @xcite .",
    "the star collaboration has already published results on @xmath5 production in au - au collisions at an energy of 130 gev per nucleon @xcite .",
    "the cross sections agreed with the glauber calculations .",
    "the elastic scattering involves the strong force , and so has a very short range @xcite .",

    "the apparent discrepancy is not well understood @xcite .    in upcs ,",
    "the coupling constant @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 is the electromagnetic coupling constant ) is very large , so multiple interactions between a single ion pair are common .",

    "the top and bottom regions were used as vetoes to reject cosmic rays .",
    "the minimum bias trigger selected events with one or more neutrons in each zdc .",
    "the zdc signals were required to occur within 1 nsec , restricting these events to the central 30 cm of the tpc .",
    "data from both triggers was processed identically , except that events from the ctb based trigger were distributed more broadly along the tpc axis , and consequently , were accepted in a broader range .",
    "upc @xmath5 production has a distinctive signature - two oppositely charged tracks with small net @xmath12 .",
    "we select events with exactly 2 primary tracks that form a vertex .",
    "the vertexing procedure considers all of the tracks in an event , and rejects tracks that are inconsistent with coming from a single vertex .",
    "we do allow a few non - primary background tracks in the tpc .",
    "the topology and minimum bias data were treated identically , except that allowance was made for the different distribution of the accepted event production points .",

    "the direct @xmath43 to @xmath11 ratio agrees with the star 130 gev analysis @xcite and with that observed by the zeus collaboration in @xmath46 interactions @xcite .",

    "for the interference analysis , a clean , low - background sample is important , so stringent event selection criteria were used , at some cost in efficiency .",

    "@xmath5 candidates were further required to have rapidity @xmath48 , to eliminate a small remaining cosmic ray contamination . finally , the pairs were required to have 550 mev @xmath49 mev .",

    "away from @xmath50 , the photon energies for the two photon directions differ , @xmath51 ; the amplitudes differ and the interference is less than maximal . although it is not expected in the soft - pomeron model , the the photon energy difference could introduce a small @xmath5 production phase difference , which could affect the interference @xcite .",
    "this analysis focuses on the region near mid - rapidity where any phase difference is small .",
    "a monte carlo calculation is used to find the interference for different rapidity ranges @xcite .",
    "we use the variable @xmath52 to study the interference . at rhic energies ,",

    "without interference , the spectrum @xmath54 for a variety of nuclear models @xcite .",
    "our calculations use a woods - saxon distribution for the gold density distribution .",
    "figure 3 compares the uncorrected minimum bias data for @xmath55 gev@xmath56 , consistent with the @xmath57 fm expected for a 3-photon reaction@xcite .",

    "the different @xmath1 values may be attributed to the different impact parameter distributions caused by the nuclear breakup tagging in the minimum bias data .",
    "the photon flux depends on the impact parameter as @xmath74 .",
    "when @xmath75 , @xmath11 are more likely to be produced on the side of the target near the photon emitter than on the far side .",
    "@xmath5 production is concentrated on the near side , leading to a smaller effective production volume and the smaller @xmath1 .",
    "this near - side skewing affects the interference slightly , but is not included in current calculations .",
    "systematic errors come from a variety of sources .",
    "we have studied the effect of detector distortions ( primarily @xmath12 smearing ) by turning off the detector simulation and comparing raw simulations with reconstructed data .",
    "this lowered @xmath65 by 18% ; if the detector simulation is 75% correct ( a very conservative assumption ) , then detector effects are a less than 5% systematic uncertainty .",
    "minor systematic uncertainties come from backgrounds and the fitting procedure .",
    "we have compared the data and simulations for a variety of kinematic and detector - based variables , and found good agreement .",
    "we estimate a preliminary experimental systematic uncertainty of 8% .",
    "this analysis depends on the shape of @xmath76 , which is calculated following ref . @xcite . for the broader picture ,",
    "it is necessary to consider the simplifications in ref .",
    "the calculation averages the photon flux over the surface of the nucleus , rather than incorporating the proper @xmath74 weighting .",
    "this may partly explain the relatively poor fit for the large-@xmath77 coulomb breakup fit .",
    "we estimate that the effective impact parameter should be within 10% of the actual ion - ion separation for the coulomb breakup data , and 3% for the exclusive @xmath11 .",
    "the uncertainties in the calculations should be at most a 15% effect . with this , the interference is @xmath78 ( star preliminary ) of that expected .",
    "the @xmath11 decays rapidly , with @xmath79 and the two @xmath11 decay points are well separated in space - time . in the usual space - time picture , the decays occur independently , and any interference must involve the final state @xmath45 .",
    "interference must involve identical final states from the two sources .",
    "however , given the large available phase space for the decays , this is very unlikely for independent decays .",
    "one possible interpretation of this result is given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in it ,",
    "the interference occurs because the post - decay wave function includes amplitudes for all possible final states , then the amplitudes for identical states subtract , and the interference is visible . because of the two sources , the @xmath45 wave function is non - factorizable , and thus exhibits the einstein - podolsky - rosen paradox @xcite .",
    "we find that the decoherence , @xmath80 , due to environmental or other factors is less than 43% at the 90% confidence level .",
    "the cross section for the production of @xmath0 pairs is peaked near threshold , with pair mass @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the electron mass .",
    "the pairs are produced predominantly in a forward - backward topology , with the @xmath83 produced with large longitudinal ( along the beampipe ) momentum and small @xmath12 .",
    "this complicates experimental detection at an ion collider , and reduces the statistics available to any analysis .",
    "this analysis used data about 800,000 minimum bias triggers taken in a 0.25 t magnetic field . the lower magnetic field ( compared to the 0.5 t full field data )",
    "increased the sensitivity to low @xmath12 particles .",
    "the minimum bias trigger freed the electrons from the requirement that they have a high enough @xmath12 to reach the ctb .",
    "this analysis @xcite used tracks with @xmath84 mev / c and pseudorapidity @xmath85 . in this region , tracking efficiency for electrons was above 80% .",
    "the electrons were identified by @xmath38 . to get good electron / hadron separation , we required the tracks to have @xmath86 mev / c . in this momentum region , electrons had considerably higher @xmath38 than hadrons , and the identification efficiency was nearly 100% , with minimal contamination .",
    "the cross section falls steeply with increasing @xmath87 , so few leptons were expected with higher momenta .",
    "we also required the events to have pair @xmath40 mev / c , pair rapidity @xmath88 and pair mass 140 mev @xmath89 mev .",
    "these cuts selected a sample of 52 events .",
    "[ pairs ]    the major backgrounds in this analysis are due to misidentified coherent @xmath45 pairs and incoherent hadronic backgrounds .",
    "the former can be calculated from the known cross section and misidentification probability .",

    "the total background is estimated to be about 1.1 events .",
    "the integrated luminosity of @xmath91 mb@xmath92 was estimated by counting hadronic events with at least 8 tracks .",

    "the data strongly favors the qed calculation , by @xmath95 .",
    "as expected , the @xmath96 for @xmath0 production is smaller than for @xmath5 production .",
    "this is because the pomeron @xmath12 scale is roughly @xmath97 , while the photon @xmath12 scale is very roughly @xmath98 .    within the kinematic acceptance region ,",
    "we find a cross section @xmath99 mb ( star preliminary ) .",
