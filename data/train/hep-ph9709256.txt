    "the w - pair production in @xmath0 annihilation is described in the standard model by three lowest order diagrams : two @xmath4 channel diagrams containing the triple gauge boson couplings and one @xmath5 channel diagram with @xmath6 exchange , that contributes to left - handed electrons only .",
    "these diagrams are presented in figure [ fig : wwgroup : diag ] .",
    "+    in the context of this study we have compared the total cross - sections obtained from different monte carlo generators in the born approximation @xcite .",
    "the standard model parameters for the cross - section calculations as used in the different monte carlo generators are summarized in table [ wwgroup : tab : param ] . +    .",
    "input parameters and obtained cross - section at 500 gev for w - pair production in @xmath7 annihilation [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the obtained values are in good agreement with the results of reference @xcite . +",
    "* the proposed detector is well suited for w physics . *",
    "better equipped forward - backward regions will improve the ww results significantly . *",
    "a conservative estimate of the reachable error of the w mass measurement is 20 mev . *",
    "a conservative estimate of the errors of the triple gauge boson couplings shows that they are in the order of @xmath8 .",
    "* this will improve over the results expected from lep2 assuming an integrated luminosity of 500 @xmath9 , by a factor of 5 for the w mass and by an order of magnitude for the anomalous couplings .",
