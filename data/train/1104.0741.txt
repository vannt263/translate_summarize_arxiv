    "stability properties of stellar spherical clusters determine a set of dynamically allowable equilibrium configurations .",
    "presence of an instability can , for example , lead to ellipsoidal deformation .    for a long time",
    ", one believed that any stellar spherical clusters , except for the pathological models , were stable .",
    "this belief appeared after the classical works by antonov ( 1960 , 1962 ) devoted to isotropic systems , and was reassured in the following papers concerning some particular anisotropic systems ( e.g. , mikhailovsky et al . 1970 , doremus et al .",
    "so , it needed some time to realize the very possibility of instability of spheres , starting from polyachenko & shukhman ( 1972 ) until merritt & aguilar ( 1985 ) , barnes et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and may & binney ( 1986 ) have made it widely known .",
    "the radial orbit instability is suppressed for sufficiently rounded orbits , or when the kinetic energy stored in transverse directions @xmath8 becomes sufficiently high .",
    "polyachenko & shukhman ( 1981 ) proposed a global anisotropy parameter as a ratio of the radial to transverse kinetic energy of the system , @xmath9 .",
    "for the idlis model ( idlis 1956 ) , they found the stability boundary @xmath10 .",
    "later , fridman & polyachenko ( 1984 ) , using this and two other families of models , proposed a hypothesis that the global anisotropy parameter can give a general stability criterion for anisotropic systems : the system is stable if @xmath11 . fell between 2.05 and 2.10 , instead of the previous boundary , @xmath12 , i. e. the systems proved to be more stable than it was supposed before .",
    "the same boundary for this family was obtained later by dejonghe and merritt ( 1988 ) with the help of n - body simulations .",
    "a new ( corrected ) boundary is slightly out of the range @xmath13 suggested by fridman & polyachenko ( 1984 ) . ]",
    "following studies of spherical models by means of the linear stability analysis ( saha 1991 , weinberg 1991 , bertin et al .",
    "1994 ) and n - body simulations ( merritt & aguilar 1985 , barnes et al .",
    "1986 , merritt 1987 , dejonghe & merritt 1988 , meza & zamorano 1997 ) included a variety of models radially anisotropic on the periphery and isotropic in the center , and vice versa . in these works , the stability boundaries in terms of the global anisotropy parameter fall in the broad range @xmath14 .",
    "thus , the hypothesis about universal stabilization in the narrow region of @xmath15 was denied .",
    "note , however , that in each case a certain value of the stability boundary corresponding to the radially anisotropic system ( @xmath16 ) was found .",
    "the same is referred to the _ generalized polytropes _ , with the df @xmath17 which become stable at @xmath18 ( fridman & polyachenko 1984 ; barnes et al .",
    "1986 ) . here",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath2 denote the energy and the angular momentum of a star , @xmath19 is the normalizing constant , @xmath4 and @xmath20  parameters of the model .",
    "additive constant in gravitational potential @xmath21 is chosen in such a way that @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the radius of the system .",
    "generalized polytropes are the simplest generalization of the isotropic polytrope models ( the latter correspond to @xmath6 ) .",
    "the polytrope models are classical ones in stability theory of both gaseous and collisionless gravitating systems .",
    "one can recall , for example , the work by antonov ( 1962 ) , in which stability of polytrope models with decreasing df was shown . models with increasing df can be unstable , but they give exotic mass distribution with increasing density outwards , thus describing unrealistic stellar systems .",
    "the generalized polytropes are more versatile .",
    "the global anisotropy parameter for ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) can be obtained in a simple form : @xmath24 note that for this model the ( local ) anisotropy parameter @xmath25 ( binney 1980 ) does not depend on radius , @xmath26 .",
    "it is possible to evaluate expressions for the radial and the transverse kinetic energy when @xmath27 , the limit @xmath28 corresponding to the system in which almost all orbits are radial .",
    "since @xmath6 case is stable ( let us consider only realistic models with @xmath29 ) , and the case @xmath30 is unstable due to the radial orbit instability , there should be a critical value of the parameter @xmath31 which divides stable and unstable systems .    using the matrix method for spheres ( polyachenko & shukhman 1981 ) , which is analogous to the kalnajs matrix method for disks ( kalnajs 1977 )",
    ", it was found that growth rates of the instability became small for @xmath32 , almost independently of parameter @xmath20 ( fridman & polyachenko 1984 ) .",
    "thus , the critical parameter for generalized polytropes is @xmath33 ( or @xmath34 ) .",
    "similar result was obtained by n - body simulations ( barnes et al .",
    "1986 ) .",
    "palmer & papaloizou ( 1987 ) ( henceforth pp87 ) have investigated the same models using approximate equation for unstable modes with low growth rates .",
    "they showed that instability must persist even for models arbitrary close to isotropic limit @xmath6 ; this seemingly contradicts previous results mentioned above .",
    "solutions of the approximate equation form a set of infinite number of unstable modes with decreasing growth rates ( eigenvalues ) which accumulate near zero frequency @xmath35 .",
    "these eigenvalues correspond to eigenfunctions with different number of nodes ; the nodeless eigenfunction gives the largest growth rate .",
    "as was argued in pp87 , the largest eigenvalue can not be caught by the approximate equation , since it is too large to fulfill the assumed condition .",
    "guided by their models b and c , which correspond to @xmath36 and @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) , we have calculated the growth rates near the isotropic limit using the approximate equation .",
    "the result was paradoxical : the largest eigenvalue kept on grow to infinity as @xmath39 , while one expects that all modes , including the nodeless one , would cease to zero .",
    "this paper pursues two goals .",
    "first , we try to reconcile the results obtained by the matrix method and n - body from one side , and the results of pp87 from the other side .",
    "second , we clarify the paradox about the applicability of the approximate equation by pp87 . for simplicity , we shall assume models with @xmath40 only .",
    "this condition provides sufficiently smooth gravitational potential in the center , and linear dependence of the precession velocity on angular momentum for nearly radial orbits ( for more details , see below ) . in section 2 ,",
    "we derive an approximate equation for modes with low growth rates from the full integral equations for spheres obtained by polyachenko et al .",
    "it coincides in all but one important detail with the approximate integro - differential equation by pp87 ( the equivalence of two equations is demonstrated in appendix ) .",
    "numerical results are given in section 3 , section 4 contains conclusions .",
    "traditional linear stability theories employ matrix methods , expanding the perturbed potential and density in series using special biorthonormal sets of basis functions ( kalnajs 1977 , polyachenko & shukhman 1981 ) . as a result ,",
    "one obtains a set of integral equations which incorporates the mode frequency in a complicated nonlinear manner .",
    "thus each frequency is to be obtained separately by , for example , the cauchy integration in the complex plane .",
    "recently we have proposed an alternative method for calculation of eigenmodes ( polyachenko 2004 , 2005 ; polyachenko et al .",
    "the advantages of our method are ( i ) linear form of the equation for eigenmodes and ( ii ) absence of the basic biorthonormal set that should be customized for a particular problem .",
    "the alternative method is the most adequate to derive the approximate integral equation similar to one used in pp87 .",

    ".    the denominators of resonance terms @xmath70 contain construction proportional to the precession rate @xmath71 which is small for nearly radial orbits , near the center .",
    "thus , for the case of our interest @xmath40 the gravitational force @xmath72 is non - singular at the center and hence the precession velocity of nearly radial orbits is indeed linear with respect to the angular momentum , @xmath73 ( see , e.g. , touma & tremaine 1997 ) .",

    "1986 ) with the results by pp87 for two reasons .    first , the approximate integral equation derived in pp87 , on which their analysis is based , is applicable to very small growth rates only . in the isotropic limit corresponding @xmath197 , these growth rates are exponentially small , i.e. @xmath198 . the estimates show , that even for @xmath199 , the allowed growth rates are much less than @xmath200 , that is definitely below any reasonable accuracy of the matrix method and n - body experiments .",

    "however the principal mode plays the major role in determining the stability boundary ( see fridman & polyachenko ( 1984 ) , barnes et al .",
    "( 1986 ) ) .",
    "the growth rates formally accurate when they are small .",
    "however , it is likely that once @xmath201 , they give reasonable estimates of actual growth rates in practice ( pp87 ) .",
    "then since isotropic systems with decreasing df are stable ( antonov 1960 , 1962 ) , _ all _ modes should become stable when @xmath4 approaching zero , and valid approximate equation must describe _ all _ modes correctly .",

    "this solution demonstrates explicitly that for the quadrupole harmonic @xmath108 there are two modes with exponentially increasing growth rates for @xmath139 .",
    "the reason for such a discrepancy arises from behavior of the terms of the approximate integral equation in the limit @xmath197 . using the notation of pp87 ,",

    "since both terms @xmath207 and @xmath205 retain in the limit when the system becomes isotropic , palmer & papaloizou infer that instability exists no matter how weak the divergence in df as @xmath208 is .    in this paper",

    "actually it means stability if we take into account a finite lifetime of real astronomical objects . besides , the most probable distributions are non - singular ones , so we have to infer that stable distributions generally become unstable at some _ finite _ value of radial anisotropy , i.e. finite anisotropy threshold exists .",
