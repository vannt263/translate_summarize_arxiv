    "asymmetric exclusion processes ( asep ) play an important role in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "the one - dimensional asep is a lattice model which describes particles hopping in one direction with stochastic dynamics and hard core exclusion .",
    "it was first introduced in 1968 to provide a qualitative understanding of the kinetics of the protein synthesis on rna templates @xcite .",
    "it turned out , however , that - despite its simplicity - there are numerous further applications of the asep on the field of interface growth , polymer dynamics , and traffic flow @xcite-@xcite .",
    "+ unfortunately , as far as traffic is concerned , the asep yields rather unrealistic results , because essential phenomena like acceleration or slowing down can not be reproduced in this model . as a consequence , nagel and schreckenberg developed an extension of the asep resulting in a one - dimensional probabilistic cellular automaton model @xcite . according to the nagel - schreckenberg model the road consists of a single lane which is divided into l cells of equal size numbered by i = 1 , 2 , @xmath9 , l and the time is also discrete .",
    "each site can be either empty or occupied by a car with integer velocity v = 0 , 1 , @xmath9 , @xmath1 .",
    "all sites are simultaneously updated according to four successive steps : @xmath10 either ring ( periodic boundary conditions ) or open ( open boundary conditions ) geometry is considered . in the case of ring geometry cars",
    "move on a ring and the car density in the system keeps constant .",
    "open systems , on the other hand , are characterized by the injection ( extinction ) rate @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) , that means , by the probability @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) that a car moves into ( out of ) the system . + for the maximum velocity @xmath1 = 1 the model is identical with the asep with parallel update @xcite-@xcite which has been solved exactly with periodic boundary conditions @xcite and recently also with open boundary conditions @xcite , @xcite",
    ". in this special case three regimes ( free flow , jamming , and maximum current ) can be distinguished from each other .",
    "the transition from the free flow to the jamming phase at the @xmath11 = @xmath12 - line for @xmath11 , @xmath12",
    "@xmath3 1-@xmath13 is of first order .",
    "the transition from the free flow ( jamming ) to the maximum current phase is continuous and takes place at the injection ( extinction ) rate @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) with @xmath14(p ) = @xmath15(p ) = 1-@xmath13 . + as it is common for traffic simulations cars are updated in parallel in the nagel - schreckenberg model , too , because this update scheme is the only one which models the formation of spontaneous jams occurring in real traffic @xcite .",
    "systems with parallel update are furthermore characterized by strong short - range correlations , and therefore , short - range correlation functions play an important role here @xcite , @xcite .",
    "+ most of the work dealing with the nagel - schreckenberg model for @xmath1 @xmath0 1 impose periodic boundary conditions @xcite-@xcite .",
    "much attention has been paid to the question of the transition from the free flow to the jamming regime . according to the state - of - the - art",
    "this is a crossover rather than a sharp transition @xcite- @xcite .",
    "systems with periodic boundary conditions are furthermore characterized by a trivial density profile @xmath16(i ) = @xmath16 with 1 @xmath17 i @xmath17",
    "l due to translational invariance . in this context",
    "it should be mentioned that short - range correlation functions are well - suited for the description of the free flow - jamming transition @xcite : the free flow regime is characterized by anticorrelations around a propagating peak , that is , in free flow cars are surrounded by empty space . at the critical density @xmath18 the anticorrelations are maximally developed , and for higher densities they vanish .",
    "simultaneously , a jamming peak develops according to the fact that the back car is strongly slowed down in a jam .",
    "+ in the following , systems for maximum velocities @xmath1 @xmath17 10 are investigated for the more realistic case of open boundaries .",
    "boundary conditions are defined as in @xcite : at site i = 0 , that means out of the system a vehicle with the probability @xmath11 and with the velocity v = @xmath1 is created .",
    "this car immediately moves according to the nagel - schreckenberg rules .",
    "if the velocity of the injected car on i = 0 is v = 0 ( because site i = 1 is occupied by another car or because the front car is on site i = 2 and the injected car is slowed down by 1 due to randomization ) then the injected car is deleted . at i",
    "= l+1 a  block",
    " occurs with probability 1 - @xmath12 and causes a slowing down of the cars at the end of the system .",
    "otherwise , with probability @xmath12 , the cars simply move out of the system . in @xcite systems with open boundaries",
    "have been already analyzed for the randomization probability p = 0 , i.e. , by ignoring the randomization step . the most interesting feature of the deterministic nagel - schreckenberg model for maximum velocities @xmath1 @xmath2 3 and open boundaries is the existence of so - called buffers : as a consequence of the parallel updating and the hindrance an injected car feels from the front car at the beginning of the system spaces larger than @xmath1 develop between two neighbouring cars for high injection rates .",
    "this can be easily demonstrated by considering i = 0 and the first sites of the system i = 1 , @xmath19 , 5 for @xmath11 = @xmath12 = 1 and @xmath20 . at an arbitrary time",
    "t = @xmath21 a car with velocity @xmath1 is injected on i = 0 , i.e. @xmath22 after application of the nasch rules on the system we have injected on i = 0 , i.e. @xmath23 correspondingly , we get for t = @xmath24 @xmath25 and for t = @xmath26 @xmath27 as the car on site i = 0 can not move it is deleted and the situation starts over in the next time step : @xmath28 and so on .",
    "obviously , one car is lost out of three injection possibilities . in the system ,",
    "far from the boundaries , the distance between two neighbouring cars turns out to be alternately @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "that means , in addition to the expected @xmath1 empty sites larger gaps occur in the @xmath11 @xmath31 1 , @xmath12 @xmath31 1 limit .",
    "we call these additional sites  buffers  because they have a buffer effect at the end of the system : due to these sites the development of jamming waves is suppressed even for @xmath12 @xmath3 1 .",
    "the transition from the free flow to the jamming phase is of first order and accompanied by the collapse of the buffers .",
    "the effect resulting from the buffers do not depend on the maximum velocity if @xmath1 @xmath2 5 ( for @xmath1 = 3,4 the buffer effect is not so strong as the buffers are not completely developed for that case ) .",
    "+ however , randomization is indispensable for the analysis of real traffic as it takes human behaviour into account : the behaviour of a car driver is not like that of a machine but rather contains unpredictable elements . in traffic , over - reactions",
    "when slowing down can be found as well as delays when accelerating , furthermore fluctuations when following a car ( follow - the - leader situation ) and so on .",
    "+ besides this motivation it is of interest to compare the general p @xmath0 0 , @xmath1 @xmath2 1 case with the previously investigated models ( p @xmath0 0 , @xmath1 = 1 @xcite , @xcite and p = 0 , @xmath1 @xmath2 1 @xcite ) .",
    "the presented results were obtained by simulating a l = 1024 sample with at least 1000 runs with @xmath32 time steps each . in order to investigate the influence of randomization on the system we proceed similarly to @xcite",
    ": section ii considers the behaviour of current and average occupation number in the middle of the system .",
    "section iii deals with density profiles , section iv with short - range correlation functions .",
    "finally , the results are summarized in section v.",
    "the phase diagram for systems with probability p = 0.5 and maximum velocity @xmath1 = 2 and @xmath1 @xmath2 5 is shown in figs 1a , b ( the case @xmath1 = 3,4 is similar to the latter case ) .",
    "for @xmath1 = 2 the phase diagram ( fig 1a ) is qualitatively the same as for the case @xmath1 = 1 @xcite , @xcite : the free flow and the jamming regime are divided by a straight line and for @xmath11 @xmath0 0.35 and @xmath12 @xmath0 0.8 the system is in the maximum current phase . obviously , the maximum current regime is smaller than for @xmath1 = 1 and there is no symmetry along the @xmath11=@xmath12-line . for @xmath1",
    "= 3 the maximum current regime is even smaller ( for @xmath11 @xmath0 0.35 and @xmath12 @xmath0 0.85 ) and the free flow / jamming border shows a slight bending .",
    "these tendencies are even stronger developed for higher maximum velocities @xmath1 with a maximum current regime for for @xmath11 @xmath0 0.35 , @xmath12 @xmath0 0.87 , and @xmath1 = 4 ( for @xmath11 @xmath0 0.35 and @xmath12 @xmath0 0.89 , and @xmath1 @xmath2 5 , see fig 1b ) . +",
    "another interesting feature of the nondeterministic case is that the course of the free flow / jamming border is totally different from that for p = 0 . in fig 1c",
    "it can be clearly seen that this difference is a consequence of the vanishing buffer effect due to randomization . for randomization probabilities",
    "p @xmath0 @xmath4 ( @xmath4 = 0.1172 @xmath33 0.008 for @xmath1",
    "= 5 ) there is no sign of the buffer effect any more , and a ( rectangular ) maximum current regime develops for @xmath11 @xmath0 @xmath34 and @xmath12 @xmath0 @xmath35 . +   + in order to understand the nature of the transition between the phases we consider the average occupation number on the site i = @xmath36 , @xmath16 ( i = @xmath36 ) , as proposed in @xcite .",
    "fig 2 shows @xmath16 ( i = @xmath36 ) for @xmath1 = 5 as a function of the injection and the extinction rates ( the average occupation number on i = @xmath36 for any @xmath1 @xmath0 1 behaves similarly ) .",
    "it turns out that phase transitions in systems with maximum velocity @xmath1 @xmath0 1 show the following features : the transition from free flow to jamming is of first order indicated by a jump in @xmath16 ( i = @xmath36 ) . at the maximum current / free flow and the maximum current / jamming transition",
    "there is a jump in the _ derivative _ of @xmath16 ( i = @xmath36 ) what is a hint at a continuous phase transition .",
    "these conclusions will be confirmed in the next section which deals with the investigation of the corresponding density profiles .",
    "+   + in the following we analyze the current due to the influence of the @xmath37 the best way to investigate the influence of the left boundary is to consider the case @xmath12 = 1 for p = 0.5 where cars simply move out of the system . in fig 3a free flow and maximum current phase",
    "can be clearly distinguished from each other . for maximum velocities @xmath1 @xmath2 5 the curves are nearly the same with a maximum at @xmath11 @xmath6 0.35 becoming stronger with increasing @xmath1 ( the occurrence of the maximum will be explained below ) .",
    "the dependence of the current on @xmath11 and @xmath12 for @xmath1 = 2 , 3 , 4 is qualitatively the same as for @xmath1 = 1 .",
    "+ for the investigation of the influence of the right boundary we consider the case @xmath11 = 1 for p = 0.5 ( fig 3b ) . here",
    ", the current for @xmath1 @xmath2 5 does not depend on the maximum velocity .",
    "furthermore , it seems to increase monotonously with increasing @xmath12 also in the maximum current phase ( @xmath12 @xmath0 0.89 ) .",
    "investigations for system sizes l @xmath2 4096 , however , show that the latter observation is just a finite size effect and that the current for @xmath1 @xmath2 5 and @xmath12 @xmath0 0.89 is constant . apart from this ,",
    "the curves for the current do not change in an essential way with increasing system size l , and therefore it is sufficient to investigate systems with l = 1024 in the following .",
    "+ from the observations so far we can conclude that - as for the deterministic case - the behaviour of the system only negligibly changes when maximum velocities @xmath1 @xmath2 5 are considered .",
    "therefore we restrict ourselves to the case @xmath1 = 5 in the following observations . +   +",
    "we will now investigate the influence of the randomization probability on the behaviour of the system .",
    "it can be seen from figs 4a , b that the buffer effect observed for the deterministic case vanishes with increasing p : for @xmath12 = 1 in fig 4a the maximum at @xmath11 @xmath6 0.81 resulting from the existence of the buffers moves to the left and becomes weaker and weaker ( in fig 4a we make an exception and consider the current at @xmath1 = 10 instead of @xmath1 = 5 , because for the latter case this effect is nearly invisible ) .",
    "for the injection rate @xmath11 = 1 , on the other hand , the buffer effect vanishes as soon as randomization probabilities p @xmath0 @xmath4 are considered .",
    "+ to sum it up it can be said that as a consequence of the buffer effect , the course of the current in the maximum current phase deviates from the expected ( constant ) behaviour for @xmath12 = 1 , p = 0.5 , and maximum velocities @xmath1 @xmath2 5 showing a slight maximum at @xmath11 @xmath6 0.35 . besides , there are strong indications that a continuous transition from the free flow ( jamming ) to a maximum current phase develops with increasing randomization probability on the @xmath12 = 1 - line ( @xmath11 = 1 - line ) .",
    "more convincing arguments for the existence of a maximum current phase , however , will be given in the following sections .",
    "our observations so far consider the behaviour of the whole system and of the site i = @xmath36 .",
    "for the analysis of what happens on the other sites it is useful to investigate the density profiles .",
    "of special interest in this context is the question in how far the density profiles reflect the transition between the phases . for that purpose",
    "we consider the density profiles for @xmath12 = 1 ( @xmath31 transition from free flow to maximum current ) , for @xmath12 = 0.7 ( @xmath31 transition from free flow to jamming ) , and for @xmath11 = 1 ( @xmath31 transition from maximum current to jamming ) .",
    "it turns out that  as in the case of @xmath1 = 1  the free flow ( jamming ) phase can be divided into the regime ai and aii ( bi and bii ) .",
    "the following investigations are confined to the randomization probability p = 0.5 , l = 1024 and @xmath1 = 5 ( for @xmath1 @xmath2 5 and",
    "l @xmath0 1024 the density profiles are qualitatively the same ) .",
    "+ in fig 5a the transition from free flow to maximum current for @xmath12 = 1 can be clearly seen .",
    "the free flow regime is characterized by oscillations at the beginning of the system dying out for i @xmath38 100 ( if p = 0.5 and @xmath1 = 5 ) due to randomization and the density profile becomes constant .",
    "it can therefore be said that randomization blurs the influence of the left boundary . in the maximum current regime",
    "we do not have any oscillations at all . instead , an analytic decrease of the density",
    "is observed becoming stronger with increasing @xmath11 .",
    "this phenomenon can be easily understood as cars hinder each other at the beginning of the system for high injection rates : the higher the injection rate the stronger the hindrance . as a consequence",
    "the density profiles in the maximum current phase do not depend at all on @xmath11 in the middle and at the end of the system . at the beginning of the system , however , the density profiles decay as @xmath39 with @xmath5 @xmath6 0.66 what is valid for _ all _ @xmath1 @xmath0 1 .",
    "we conjecture that @xmath5 = @xmath7 because the exponent converges to this value with increasing system sizes .",
    "that means that the cases @xmath1 = 1 and @xmath1 @xmath0 1 belong to different universality classes since the corresponding density profiles for the asep with parallel update decay as @xmath39 with @xmath5 = @xmath8 at the beginning of the system @xcite , @xcite .",
    "+ the free flow / maximum current transition is nicely reflected by the density at the end of the system : @xmath16(i = l ) is proportional to the injection rate when the cars move freely up to @xmath14 = 0.35 and becomes constant in the maximum current regime .",
    "+ the situation is different when density profiles at the free flow - jamming border for @xmath12 = 0.7 are considered ( fig 5b ) .",
    "it can be easily seen that the transition is of first order as the density profile at @xmath14 = 0.278 is linear which is a typical feature of a first - order phase transition ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "+ the density profiles for the injection rate @xmath11 = 1 are shown in fig 5c .",
    "the course of the curves for @xmath12 @xmath3 0.89 ( @xmath12 @xmath0 0.89 ) is typical for the maximum current ( bii jamming ) phase with an algebraic ( exponential ) decay at the beginning of the system due to the hindrance already described for @xmath12 = 1 . the decay becomes weaker with decreasing @xmath12 and finally vanishes as the repercussion resulting from the blockage at i = l+1 increasingly superimposes the hindrance effect at the beginning of the system . for extinction rates",
    "0.6 @xmath40 @xmath12 @xmath40 0.9 there is a slight increase at the end of the system which indicates a hindrance due to the blockage .",
    "it just remains a border effect , however , and is of no relevance for the considerations in this article .",
    "in this chapter we consider short - range correlation functions @xmath41 where @xmath42 @xmath43 describes the spatial and temporal average over all l sites i and over times t taken from our simulation of the steady state .",
    "+ the correlation functions are measured in the middle of the system where the influence of the boundaries is minimal .",
    "we do not only investigate the cases @xmath12 = 1 ( influence of the left boundary , fig 6a ) and @xmath11 = 1 ( influence of the right boundary , fig 6b ) , but also @xmath12 = 1-@xmath11 ( fig 6c ) .",
    "for the latter case there are similar conditions at both boundaries and the system can be compared at best with the corresponding system with periodic boundary conditions . therefore it is no surprise that the correlation functions in fig 6c are qualitatively the same as those for periodic boundary conditions @xcite . + what is interesting",
    ", however , is that a classification into free flow , maximum current , and jamming can not be done when short - range correlation functions are considered .",
    "instead , due to figs 6a - c three regimes can be distinguished from each other : @xmath44 as it is obvious from the previous sections the transition from ji to jii is not a phase transition and does not change the behaviour of the system in an essential way .",
    "+ in correspondence with @xcite the critical injection ( extinction ) rate @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) for the ji - jii transition is defined by the vanishing of the propagating peak and takes place at @xmath46 @xmath6 0.65 ( see also fig 1b ) . unfortunately",
    ", an exact value for the free flow - jamming transition can neither be given .",
    "as a consequence of the randomized oscillations in the density at the beginning of the system it is not possible to determine the critical injection ( extinction ) rate at which the influence of the right boundary reaches the left boundary .",
    "this is a significant difference to the deterministic case @xcite where the oscillations of the free flow phase form a well - defined pattern due to the lack of randomization .",
    "+ the transition from jamming i to jamming ii takes place at @xmath12 @xmath6 0.65 for _ all _ @xmath1 @xmath0 1 . in other words : when the maximum velocity is varied free flow , jii and coexistence phase ( ji+maximum current ) keep constant and only the ratio between maximum current phase and ji changes ( figs 1a , b ) .",
    "the nondeterministic nagel - schreckenberg model depends on the randomization , the maximum velocity , and the boundary conditions : + the buffer effect observed for the deterministic case p = 0 and @xmath1 @xmath2 3 is strongly weakened with increasing randomization probability .",
    "for @xmath1 = 2 there are no buffers and therefore the corresponding phase diagram is similar to the case @xmath1 = 1 for all p values . for @xmath1 @xmath2 3 and p",
    "@xmath0 @xmath4 ( @xmath4 = 0.1172 @xmath33 0.008 for @xmath1 = 5 ) the buffer effect completely vanishes since the development of jamming waves is no longer suppressed . as a consequence ,",
    "a maximum current phase occurs for p @xmath0 @xmath4 and the free flow ( jamming ) phase can be divided into two regimes ai and aii ( bi and bii ) similarly to the case of @xmath1 = 1,2 .",
    "another analogy to the case @xmath1 = 1 is that the free flow / jamming ( free flow / maximum current and jamming / maximum current ) transition is of first ( second ) order .",
    "+ there are , however , essential differences between systems with @xmath1 = 1 and @xmath1 @xmath0 1 : in the maximum current phase the density profiles decay algebraically with an exponent @xmath5 = @xmath7 for @xmath1 @xmath2 2 whereas @xmath5 = @xmath8 was obtained in the asep .",
    "this indicates that systems with @xmath1 @xmath0 1 and @xmath1 = 1 belong to different universality classes .",
    "another difference to the asep is the existence of oscillations at the beginning of the system due to the repulsion of the cars .",
    "+ the comparison of systems with periodic and with open boundary conditions suggests that there are mainly three differences .",
    "first of all , the transition from free flow to jamming for systems with open boundaries is sharp and there is no maximum current phase in the case of periodic boundary conditions .",
    "moreover , the dependence on the maximum velocity is more complex for systems with open boundary conditions due to the occurrence of the buffers .",
    "however , there are common features , too : measurements of the short - range correlation function show that  as for corresponding systems with periodic boundary conditions  three regimes can be distinguished from each other : ( a ) free flow : cars do not hinder each other ( b ) maximum current and jamming i : coexistence of freely moving and jammed cars ( c ) jamming ii : cars are jammed .",
