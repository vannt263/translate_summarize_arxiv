    "because of their long coherence times , spins in solids are attractive candidates for quantum information processing . in pure and nuclear - spin - free crystals , electron spins such as nv centers or donors in silicon",

    "nuclear spins can reach even longer coherence times , up to several hours as demonstrated recently  @xcite . while these experiments were carried out on large ensembles of spins , manipulation , read - out , and entanglement of individual spins remain outstanding challenges .",
    "existing single - spin readout methods include spin - to - charge conversion , which has been successfully applied to electrostatically - defined quantum dots in two - dimensional electron gases  @xcite and to individual donors  @xcite , and spin - dependent photoluminescence in special systems such as defect centers in diamond  @xcite or in silicon carbide  @xcite .",
    "our goal here is to discuss another method which is applicable to all types of electronic spins and may therefore have an impact on the general field of magnetic resonance in addition to its use in quantum information .",
    "our idea is to push the principle of inductive detection  @xcite , which is the basis of all existing commercial electronic paramagnetic resonance spectrometers , to the single - spin limit .",
    "inductive detection of electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) proceeds by inserting a sample that contains the paramagnetic impurities of interest in a microwave resonator of frequency @xmath2 . in continuous - wave ( cw ) epr spectroscopy , it is the microwave absorption that occurs when the spin larmor frequency tuned by a dc magnetic field @xmath3 matches @xmath2 which is detected , giving rise to a dip in the transmitted signal amplitude .",
    "the most sensitive spectrometers based on inductive - detection so far are able to detect @xmath4spins@xmath5  @xcite ; reaching the single - spin limit requires therefore a gain of several orders of magnitude in sensitivity . to meet this challenge",
    ", we propose to maximize the spin - resonator coupling constant by confining the microwave field in a nanometric constriction using superconducting planar resonators of high quality factor , as discussed recently in the context of spin - based quantum information  @xcite .",
    "we also propose to use parametric amplifiers  @xcite to amplify the spin signal with a quantum - limited sensitivity .",
    "a first step in that direction was taken in a recent experiment where the spin signal was amplified by a parametric amplifier , and which reached a sensitivity of @xmath6 spins@xmath5  @xcite .",
    "another key aspect of the proposal , namely that spin energy relaxation is dominated by spontaneous emission of photons through the cavity , was also demonstrated recently  @xcite .    here , taking realistic values for the resonator design and coupling to the spin , we predict that the absorption dip in the integrated homodyne signal due to the presence of a single spin should be detectable with a unit signal - to - noise ratio in a detection time of few milliseconds , corresponding to a sensitivity of @xmath7spin@xmath8 .",
    "we also analyze the system from a quantum optics perspective , beyond the simple integration of the homodyne signal , using a quantum trajectory formalism .",

    "we assume that the resonator - antenna coupling is chosen such that the loaded quality factor reaches @xmath10 , whereas the internal resonator losses are negligible due to superconductivity ; in that regime , all the available signal is emitted into the measurement line , thus maximizing the measurement efficiency .",
    "after routing by a circulator , this signal is first amplified by a josephson parametric amplifier ( jpa ) , then by a low - noise hemt amplifier at 4k before demodulation at room - temperature , yielding the two signal quadratures @xmath11 ( see fig .  [",

    "a key aspect of the proposal is the use of a jpa to amplify the spin signal .",
    "the jpa is an ultra - low - noise microwave amplifier recently developed in the context of circuit qed with performance close to the quantum limit  @xcite . this performance is conveniently quantified by the quantum efficiency parameter @xmath12 , @xmath13 being the number of noise photons added during the detection process . if the signal detection is performed using the hemt amplifier with a system noise temperature @xmath14k , @xmath15 yields @xmath16 .",

    ", it is interesting to evaluate the parameters for the cases of nv centers in diamond and bismuth donors in silicon . with the figures provided in section ii , nv centers have a purcell relaxation time @xmath263 , yielding a measurement time @xmath264ms ( assuming unit detector efficiency @xmath265 ) .",
    "similarly , bismuth donors in silicon can reach @xmath266 , resulting in @xmath267ms .",
    "we thus conclude that a high fidelity single spin microwave detection should be possible in just milliseconds for the model systems considered in this work .",
    "in the previous section we showed that the value of the voltage signal integrated over a few @xmath268 allows discrimination of the spin in the resonator . by representing the signal by only its integral over time , however , we omit important information contained in the temporal signal correlations . we can assess this information by application of quantum trajectory theory , which evolves the quantum state in time , conditioned on the stochastic measurement record .",
    "this state in turn provides the probabilities for subsequent values of the detected signal .",
    "the outcome probabilities depend on whether the spin is included in the simulation or not , and given the actual outcome , we can apply bayes rule and infer the ( classical ) probability that the spin is actually present .",
    "the state of a quantum system subject to continuous probing obeys a stochastic master equation ( sme ) [ eq : sme ] d=-[h , ] dt+_j[c_j]dt+ [ c_m]dw , where the stochastic term , which has been added to the conventional master equation ( [ eq : me ] ) accounts for the back action of the noisy measurement with the outcome @xmath269 given in ( [ eq : dy ] ) .",

    "the sme thus yields the time dependent state @xmath273 of the system conditioned on the measurements until time @xmath274 , and it provides the expected mean value and the probability for the next detector outcome . propagating the sme for different candidate hypotheses or parameter values thus provides the necessary input to apply bayes rule and determine the most likely circumstance of the experiment : the actual measurement outcome @xmath269 during a time interval @xmath275 $ ] updates the probability @xmath276 that an unknown parameter has a certain value @xmath277 via bayes rule : [ eq : bayes ] p(_i , t+dt)p(_i|dy ) = p(_i , t ) , where @xmath278 is the _ prior _ probability of the parameter having value @xmath277 at time @xmath274 .",
    "the denominator @xmath279 merely serves to normalise the updated probabilities so that @xmath280 . after each infinitesimal time - step @xmath244",
    "we thus update the probability distribution @xmath281 , which evolves during the full measurement process .",
    "if we start , for example , with a uniform distribution @xmath282 , where @xmath13 is the number of candidate hypotheses , we must , in parallel , solve @xmath13 stochastic master equations , which are all subject to the same measurement record @xmath269 .",
    "each solution thus provides @xmath283 , needed in ( [ eq : bayes ] ) to update the probability weights on the different hypotheses .    to assess the efficacy of the bayesian analysis for our purpose , we have assigned equal _ prior _ probabilities for having a spin and having no spin in the resonator , @xmath284 , and simulated measurement currents corresponding to the two cases .",
    "the simulated voltage signals were obtained with the parameters : @xmath285rad / s , @xmath286 , @xmath287 , and @xmath21 .",
    "we used bayes formula ( [ eq : bayes ] ) to update the probabilities that a person having only access to the measurement data would assign to the two possibillies of having a spin or no spin in the resonator .",
    "the probabilities evolve with time as shown with the blue and black curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : bayes ] ( a ) for two distinct simulations with signals generated as if a spin is present or not .",
    "the black curve rapidly converges to value zero , deducing correctly that the resonator is not interacting with a spin .",
    "the blue curve fluctuates for slightly longer , but eventually reaches unit probability around a measurement time @xmath288ms with our parameters .",
    "we have repeated the simulations 3000 times to obtain the distribution of probabilities , shown for measurement times @xmath289 and @xmath290 @xmath291 in fig .",
    "[ fig : bayes ] ( b)-(d ) .",
    "the blue histograms correspond to simulated measurement records with a spin interacting with the resonator and the black ones to the case of no spin . as in our analysis based on the integrated signals , we can assess the probability of making a wrong assignment by the tail of the blue ( black ) distributions extending above ( below ) the conditional probability @xmath292 . unlike in the previous section , this assignment error probability does not have an analytical expression , but it can be determined from our numerical simulations .",
    "for different detector efficiencies we thus obtain the assignment errors shown as the noisy curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : errors ] .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : errors ] , the bayesian analysis extracts more information from the measurement signal than we can obtain based on the integrated signal .",
    "the difference in the error probability is quite appreciable and for example , allows a bayesian analysis of data obtained by a detector with efficiency @xmath21 to yield the same information as the integrated signal obtained with a detector efficiency of @xmath293 .",
    "alternatively , we observe that with the same detector efficiency we obtain a confident discrimination of the presence of a spin 30% faster by use of the bayes analysis than by use of only the integrated signal .    .",
    "panel ( a ) shows the probabilities as a function of time when @xmath294 is a measurement current from a simulation with a spin ( blue curve ) and when there is no spin ( black curve ) .",
    "panels ( b ) -",
    "( d ) show the normalised distribution of the values of @xmath295 for 3000 simulations at measurement times @xmath296 and @xmath168 @xmath291 , respectively .",
    "blue histograms correspond to simulations with a spin and black histograms to simulations with no spin interacting with the resonator .",
    "the parameters of the simulation are specified in fig.([fig : bayes]).,scaledwidth=47.0% ]     indicated next to the arrows which connect the smooth curves depicting eq .",
    "( [ eq : error1 ] ) , based on the integrated measurement current , and the more noisy curves , based on the bayesian analysis .",
    "the red smooth and noisy curves correspond to the experimentally realistic detector efficiency value @xmath21 .",
    "the interaction and damping parameters are the same as in fig.([fig : bayes]).,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    the improvement due to the bayesian analysis is due to the information retrievable from temporal correlations in the emitted signal .",
    "the random measurements cause back action on the system and thus cause its subsequent transient evolution to deviate at all times from the constant steady state of the master equation .",
    "such transient evolution yields more information than mean values about the system as seen most dramatically , e.g. , in photon counting signals , where a two - level emitter makes a quantum jump into the ground state after each detection event , and hence has to be re - excited before a second detection can occur .",
    "while the mean , and hence integrated , counting signal saturate and thus hamper distinction between different strong driving fields , the transient excited state population after each detector click causes anti - bunching and a modulation in the intensity correlation function which , in fact , allows the same resolution at all driving strengths  @xcite .    for continuous homodyne detection ,",
    "the stochastic back action on the emitter is a weaker effect than in the case of counting , but it still accounts for temporal correlations in the noisy signal which are not being used in the mean field analysis , e.g. , the frequency spectrum of the emitted field  @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have proposed and analyzed an experimental scheme where a superconducting microwave resonator is employed for detection of a single electron spin . from the steady state of the system we identified the dependence of the mean signal and the signal fluctuations on the spin coupling parameters and we have shown that with realistic parameters , we can detect the presence of a single spin within an integration time of few milliseconds .",
    "we also showed that a bayesian analysis of the detected signal permits faster and more reliable discrimination of the spin than the mean field analysis due to the temporal signal correlations associated with the measurement back action on the spin dynamics .",
