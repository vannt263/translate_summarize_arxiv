    ". both signatures would be significant of processes due to the production in pairs of squarks and gluinos , subsequently decaying into quarks , gluons , other standard - model ( sm ) particles and a neutralino ( interpreted as the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) ) in a r - parity conserving susy theory . as reported in ref.@xcite in both analyses",
    "the data appear to be consistent with the expected sm backgrounds ; thus constraints are derived on the model parameters in the case of a minimal supergravity model ( msugra , also denoted as cmms ) @xcite for the specific standard benchmark with trilinear coupling @xmath3=0 , ratio of vacuum expectation values @xmath4=3 , higgs  mixing parameter @xmath5 in the plane of the universal scalar and gaugino mass parameters @xmath6@xmath7 . in ref .",
    "@xciteconstraints are also discussed in terms of two of the conventional benchmarks within sugra models : those denoted by lm1 and lm0 ( or su4 ) in the literature @xcite .",
    "though these constraints depend on the specific sets of the msugra parameters employed in the phenomenological analysis , the general outcome of refs.@xcite is that the lower bounds on the squark and gluino masses are sizeably higher as compared to the previous limits established by the experiments d0 @xcite and cdf @xcite at the tevatron .    in this paper",
    "we consider the implications of the results of refs .",
    "@xcite for the supersymmetric scheme discussed in refs .",
    "i.  e. _ for an effective mssm scheme at the electroweak scale with the following independent parameters : @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "notations are as follows : @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the u(1 ) , su(2 ) and su(3 ) gaugino masses ( these parameters are taken here to be positive ) , @xmath13 is the higgs mixing mass parameter , @xmath4 the ratio of the two higgs v.e.v.s , @xmath14 the mass of the cp - odd neutral higgs boson , @xmath15 is a squark soft  mass common to all squarks , @xmath16 is a slepton soft  mass common to all sleptons , and @xmath9 is a common dimensionless trilinear parameter for the third family , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( the trilinear parameters for the other families being set equal to zero ) . since no gaugino - mass unification at a grand unified scale",
    "is assumed ( at variance with one of the major assumptions in msugra ) , in this model the neutralino mass is not bounded by the lower limit @xmath19 50 gev that is commonly derived in msugra schemes from the lep lower bound on the chargino mass ( of about 100 gev ) . in refs.@xcite it is shown that , if r - parity is conserved , a light neutralino ( _ i .",
    "e. _ a neutralino with @xmath20 50 gev ) is a very interesting candidate for cold dark matter ( cdm ) , due to its relic abundance and its relevance in the interpretation of current experiments of search for relic particles ; in refs .",
    "@xcite also a lower bound , @xmath21 7 - 8 gev , is obtained from the cosmological upper limit on cdm .",
    "the compatibility of these results with all experimental searches for direct or indirect evidence of susy ( prior to the results of refs.@xcite ) and with other precision data that set constraints on possible effects due to supersymmetry is discussed in detail in ref.@xcite . the susy model described above",
    "will hereafter be denoted as light neutralino model ( lnm ) ; within this model , the so - called _",
    "scenario @xmath22 _ @xcite will be considered in the present analysis .",
    "the main features of this scenario are : i ) @xmath14 must be light , 90 gev @xmath23 gev ( 90 gev being the lower bound from lep searches ) ; ii ) @xmath24 has to be large : @xmath24 = 2045 , iii ) the @xmath25 mixing needs to be sizeable , which in turn implies small values of @xmath13 : @xmath26 gev .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to establish the novelties introduced by the outcomes of the recent cms and atlas investigations on the features of the lnm , with special emphasis on the aspects concerning the neutralino as a cdm candidate . for detailed discussions of lnm models , see refs . @xcite and especially ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "first , we recall that the neutralino , defined as the linear superposition of bino @xmath27 , wino @xmath28 and of the two higgsino states @xmath29 ,",
    "@xmath30 , @xmath31 , of lowest mass @xmath2 , is described within the minimal supersymmetric extension of the sm only through a subset of the susy model parameters , namely @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the neutral higgs mass @xmath14 and the slepton mass @xmath34 are instead crucial parameters intervening in the neutralino - nucleon scattering and in the neutralino pair - annihilation processes ( and then also in the neutralino relic abundance ) @xcite .",
    "the three remaining parameters characterizing the lnm : @xmath12 , @xmath15 and @xmath9 , enter into play , when the large host of experimental results that constrain supersymmetry are implemented into the model @xcite .",
    "this experimental information is derived from : 1 ) the searches at accelerators for higgs bosons and supersymmetric charged particles ( sleptons and charginos at lep , squarks and gluinos at hadron colliders ) ; 2 ) the b - meson rare decays at the tevatron and the b - factories ; 3 ) the muon anomalous magnetic moment ; 4 ) the @xmath35 decay .",
    "one further crucial requirement which guarantees that the neutralino can be interpreted as a relic particle in the universe is that its relic abundance satisfies the cosmological bound @xmath36 0.12 .",
    "all these data set significant constraints on the model parameters and also entail sizable correlations among some of them .",
    "in particular , various constraints and correlations involving the susy parameters follow from the loop correction terms , due to supersymmetry , that can affect the physical quantities involved in the items ( 2 - 4 ) above .",
    "one of the most important constraints among those mentioned above is the one established by the branching ratio of the @xmath37 decay process .",
    "indeed , in the lnm this branching ratio lies in its experimental range if the contribution of a loop diagram with a charged higgs and the top quark is compensated by the contribution of a loop diagram with a chargino and a top squark @xcite .",
    "since our lnm ( in _ scenario @xmath22 _ ) entails both a light charged higgs ( of mass @xmath38 ) and a light chargino ( of mass @xmath39 100 - 200 gev ) , also @xmath15 has to be not too heavy . a strong correlation implied by the @xmath40 decay process between @xmath14 ( through @xmath41 ) and @xmath15",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : scat_ma_m_sq ] , where a scatter plot for a light neutralino population is represented by ( black ) dots when the @xmath42 constraint is not implemented , and by ( red ) crosses when this constraint is applied . in this second case",
    "it turns out that : i ) @xmath15 and @xmath14 are rather strongly correlated , ii ) the squark mass is limited by the upper bound @xmath43 800 gev .",
    "notice that the variation in the density of points of fig .",
    "[ fig : scat_ma_m_sq ] is just due to a different sampling of the regions of interest in the parameter space . the relaxation of the @xmath44 constraint is only considered here in connection with fig .",
    "[ fig : scat_ma_m_sq ] , for illustration purposes .",
    "this constraint is implemented in all our further discussions and results .",
    "since the lower bound on the neutralino mass , implied by the cosmological bound @xmath45 , increases as @xmath46 @xcite , the correlation between @xmath15 and @xmath14 entails also a correlation between @xmath15 and @xmath2 , as displayed in fig.[fig : scat_mchi_m_sq ] .    .",
    "the ( red ) line represents an interpolation of the lower boundary on @xmath2 as a function of @xmath47 . ]",
    "these correlations imply that a lower bound on @xmath15 , derived from accelerator measurements could potentially have the consequence of increasing the lower bound on @xmath2 , as compared to the one of about 78 gev , previously established within the lnm @xcite .",
    "thus , it is important to establish which lower limit on @xmath15 can be actually derived from the cms and atlas results @xcite .",
    "before we come to an analysis of this point , let us just remark that a loop involving the chargino and the stop , as the one relevant for the @xmath40 , is also responsible for a potentially sizable susy contribution to the branching ratio for the decay @xmath48 .",
    "indeed , this loop correction behaves as @xmath49 @xcite , thus , at large @xmath24 , it can overshoot the experimental upper bound : @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "this can actually occur in sugra models , with the effect of constraining the neutralino phenomenology drastically @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that in the lnm this is not the case , since : ( a ) the chargino intervening in the relevant loop is light , and ( b ) the splitting in the top mass eigenstates can be small ( a condition that is met whenever : @xmath51 ) .",
    "this last requirement is exemplified by the lower frontier of the scatter plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : scat_atrilinear_m_sq ] displaying the correlation between @xmath9 and @xmath15 . in this figure",
    "the upper bound on @xmath47 is due , as already mentioned , to the bound on the @xmath42 decay .",
    "the point we wish to stress here is that , as shown in the numerical analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , the constraint imposed by the branching ratio for the decay @xmath48 is compatible with the constraints due to the branching ratio of the @xmath40 decay process , a feature which is not trivial , due to the different role played by the parameter @xmath15 in the two processes .",
    "however , it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : scat_atrilinear_m_sq ] that as the squark soft mass parameter @xmath47 gets close to its upper bound , the interplay of the two constraints entails a growing tuning of the @xmath9 trilinear coupling for the highest values of @xmath47 . in the same figure",
    "( black ) dots show configurations for which all constraints are applied , while for ( red ) crosses the bound from @xmath52 measurements is not implemented .",
    "as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this latter bound is somewhat less robust than other constraints , due to the uncertainties affecting both theoretical estimates and experimental determinations related to b  meson decays . as can be seen from fig .",

    "after appropriate cuts to reject the background and to reduce the probability of jet mismeasurements , the cms search for events with jets and missing transverse energy derived an upper bound @xmath53= 13 events at 95% confidence level in the signal region for an integrated luminosity @xmath54 pb @xmath55 .",

    "that when converted into an upper bound on the cross section @xmath66 implies @xmath67 . since @xmath68",
    "we conclude that , within the lnm scenario , the cms analysis is significantly more sensitive than that from atlas is due to the cut on the angle between the missing transverse momentum vector and the jets , applied by atlas to reduce the probability of jet mismeasurement @xcite . ] . as a consequence of the above discussion , in the following we will concentrate only on the discussion of the cms bound .    in fig.[fig :",

    "the shaded area below the ( red ) solid line would be excluded adopting @xmath73 and represents the maximal impact of the cms measurement on the lnm parameter space .",
    "it is important here to point out that , at variance with the sugra scenario , within the lnm model the gluino mass @xmath12 is not related to the other gaugino masses , and in particular to @xmath74 by gut relations .",
