    ", this control is achieved using adiabatic processes , where the system parameters are changed slowly from the initial to the desired final value @xcite .",
    "if the change is slow enough , the system follows the instantaneous eigenvalues and eigenstates of the time - dependent hamiltonian and obtains the desired final state with a good approximation .",
    "the inherent drawback of adiabatic processes is that they require long times which may render them impractical , since most of the systems are not isolated but are exposed to undesirable interactions with the surrounding environment ( decoherence ) that lead to dissipation @xcite .",
    "several methods have been proposed to speed up adiabatic quantum dynamics .",
    "their common characteristic is that they prepare a similar final state as the adiabatic process at a given final time ( which in principle can be made arbitrarily short ) , without necessarily following the adiabatic path at each moment .",
    "the corresponding adiabatic - like trajectories are successfully characterized as shortcuts to adiabaticity . in the method of counter - diabatic control @xcite ,",
    "the applied electromagnetic field restores the adiabatic dynamics of the system by suppressing diabatic effects as they are generated . in the method of transitionless",
    "quantum driving @xcite , an appropriate auxiliary time - dependent interaction is added such that the augmented system arrives in finite time at a similar quantum state with the adiabatic trajectory of the unperturbed system . in a closely related method",
    ", the trajectory of the shortcut is picked first and then the time - dependent interaction generating the corresponding evolution is inversely engineered @xcite , using the theory of lewis - riesenfeld invariants @xcite .",
    "the above methods have been tested experimentally @xcite and proven quite robust to various types of noise @xcite .",
    "they also share another interesting feature : they do not specify a unique shortcut but rather provide entire families of them @xcite .",
    "this ample freedom can be exploited using optimal control methods to find the shortcuts which minimize relevant physical criteria , like time , under realistic experimental constraints @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we use optimal control theory to design the shortest adiabatic - like shortcut for a potential well with a moving boundary , in the presence of restrictions suggested by the experimental setup .",
    "this system provides a model for a _ quantum piston _ and has some interesting applications .",
    "note that the shortcuts to adiabaticity for this quantum piston have been studied in @xcite , as well as their potential applications to the control of many - body quantum dynamics .",
    "here we mostly concentrate on the control aspects of the problem , but we also highlight some nice applications . in section [ sec : shortcuts ] we summarize the important points of the above work which are essential for the current analysis and also formulate the time - optimal control problem for the expansion of the piston .",
    "we solve this problem in section [ sec : shortest ] and obtain the minimum expansion time as a function of the expansion factor of the piston . in section [ sec :",
    "results ] we compare our optimal results with those obtained using the inverse engineering method .",
    "using the fact that the minimum expansion time has a logarithmic dependence on the expansion factor for large values of the latter , we reobtain the cooling rate of a refrigerator @xcite , a result which quantifies the unattainability of absolute zero implied by the third law of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "finally , we discuss how the control problem studied here is related to the fast adiabatic - like expansion of an optical lattice with dynamically variable spacing @xcite .",

    "the slower is the expansion , the better is the approximation in ( [ adiabatic ] ) .",
    "for fast expansion the adiabatic approximation breaks down .    a method has been proposed recently to accelerate adiabatic quantum dynamics , according to which an auxiliary potential is designed such that the system acquires a similar quantum state with the reference adiabatic path ( [ adiabatic ] ) in arbitrarily short time @xmath19 @xcite . for the case of an expanding piston ,",
