    "<S> we use the gelfand - tsetlin pattern to construct an effective hamiltonian , completely integrable action of a torus @xmath0 on an open dense subset of a coadjoint orbit of the unitary group . </S>",
    "<S> we then identify a proper hamiltonian @xmath0-manifold centered around a point in the dual of the lie algebra of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> a theorem of karshon and tolman says that such a manifold is equivariantly symplectomorphic to a particular subset of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this fact enables us to construct symplectic embeddings of balls into certain coadjoint orbits of the unitary group , and therefore obtain a lower bound for their gromov width . using the identification of the dual of the lie algebra of the unitary group with the space of @xmath2 hermitian matrices , </S>",
    "<S> the main theorem states that for a coadjoint orbit through @xmath3diag@xmath4 in the dual of the lie algebra of the unitary group , where at most one eigenvalue is repeated , the lower bound for gromov width is equal to the minimum of the differences @xmath5 , over all @xmath6 . for a generic orbit ( i.e. with distinct @xmath7 s ) , with additional integrality conditions , </S>",
    "<S> this minimum has been proved to be exactly the gromov width of the orbit . for nongeneric orbits </S>",
    "<S> this lower bound is new .    </S>",
