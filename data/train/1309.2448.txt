    "discovered long ago , an ` einstein - rosen bridge ' @xcite represents a connection between the two exterior regions of a schwarzschild black hole space time , and thus forms an inter - universe connection . as realized by wheeler @xcite such a bridge could also form an intra - universe connection , bridging arbitrarily large distances within a single universe . however , it became soon clear that such a schwarzschild wormhole would not be traversable for matter and for light @xcite .",
    "a different type of wormhole that is not associated with black holes was discovered by ellis @xcite , bronnikov @xcite , and kodama @xcite . to obtain such wormhole solutions , they had to invoke some form of exotic matter , whose energy - momentum tensor violates the null , weak and strong energy conditions .",
    "the candidate they chose for such exotic matter was a phantom scalar field , whose kinetic term has a reversed sign .    in the seminal work of morris and thorne @xcite traversability of this type of wormhole",
    "was the central goal . however , traversability does not only require small accelerations and tidal forces , but it also requires stability of the wormhole . whereas early work seemed to indicate that such phantom field wormholes could be stable @xcite , later work showed , that they are unstable @xcite .    to achieve stability ,",
    "one may on the one hand consider a generalized theory of gravity with a different type of matter content .",
    "a case at hand is the study of wormholes in einstein - gau - bonnet - dilaton gravity @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been argued , that rotating wormholes would have a higher possibility of being stable @xcite and thus traversable .",
    "a first example of a rotating wormhole was given by teo @xcite .",
    "however , he did not solve a set of einstein - matter equations , but discussed only the general form and properties of such a wormhole . at the same time",
    "khatsymovsky @xcite discussed some general properties of a slowly rotating wormhole .",
    "a thorough analysis of the teo wormhole was given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "recently , kashargin and sushkov @xcite set out to construct self - consistent wormhole solutions . invoking a phantom scalar field they solved the einstein - matter equations for slow rotation in first and second order .",
    "thus these perturbative solutions represent slowly rotating generalizations of the morris - thorne wormholes .",
    "they showed that the mass of a rotating wormhole is greater than that of a nonrotating one , and that the null energy condition violation is weaker in a rotating wormhole .",
    "clearly , the outstanding quest is to obtain nonperturbative rotating wormhole solutions and to subsequently study their stability .",
    "however , in four dimensions one has to deal with partial differential equations in the presence of rotation .",
    "therefore we here consider the simpler problem of rotating wormholes in five dimensions , whose two angular momenta are of equal magnitude . in this case one",
    "obtains a cohomogeneity-1 problem , and thus only a system of ordinary differential equations @xcite .",
    "while the non - rotating wormhole solutions with a phantom scalar field in five dimensions can be given in analytical form @xcite , we obtain only partially analytical solutions in the rotating case . here",
    "two of the metric functions are obtained numerically .",
    "we find a smarr - type relation for the rotating wormholes , that has the same form as the smarr relation for extremal rotating black holes .",
    "we determine the domain of existence of the rotating wormholes and the change of the geometry of the throat with increasing angular momentum .",
    "subsequently we analyze the stability of these rotating wormhole solutions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we present the action , the anstze and the field equations . we discuss the main wormhole features in section iii .",
    "the analytical solutions for the static wormholes and the numerical results for the rotating wormholes are presented in section iv .",
    "section v is devoted to the stability analysis of these solutions .",
    "we give our conclusions in section vi .",
    "the appendix a contains a generalization of the analytical solution for the static wormholes for an arbitrary dimension @xmath0 . in appendix",
    "b we give the asymptotics of the solutions together with their expression in the slowly rotating limit .",

    "the nonperturbative solutions are constructed numerically . in this approach ,",
    "the constraint equation ( [ ric22 ] ) is used to monitor the quality of the numerical results .",
    "let us begin by noting , that in the case of rotating wormholes we can not simply require asymptotic flatness for both universes , as already realized in @xcite .",
    "we therefore now consider the asymptotic region @xmath62 , where we demand that the spacetime be asymptotically flat .",
    "an expansion in the asymptotic region @xmath62 yields @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 denote the mass and the two equal angular momenta , respectively , and each angular momentum is associated with rotation in an orthogonal plane . from eq .",
    "( [ asymp1 ] ) we find @xmath73 computing @xmath74 from eq .",
    "( [ asymp2 ] ) and comparing with eq .",
    "( [ omprime ] ) , we can read off the constant @xmath49 , finding @xmath75 .    to derive the smarr relation",
    "we observe that @xmath76 integration from the location of the throat @xmath77 to @xmath78 yields @xmath79 where the subscript @xmath80 denotes evaluation at @xmath77 .    for symmetric wormhole solutions the throat",

    "( [ sm1 ] ) then reduces to @xmath83 note , that the smarr relation eq .",
    "( [ sm2 ] ) for symmetric wormholes agrees with the one for extremal myers - perry black holes with equal angular momenta , when the angular velocity @xmath84 of the throat of the wormhole is replaced by the horizon angular velocity @xmath85 of the black hole .",
    "let us now turn to the discussion of the other asymptotic limit , @xmath64 .",
    "clearly , the static solutions are asymptotically flat both in the symmetric and non - symmetric case . for non - symmetric wormholes , however , time is flowing at a different rate in the two asymptotic regions . to better understand the asymptotic region @xmath64 for the rotating solutions , we first integrate eq .",
    "( [ omprime ] ) to find the function @xmath86 @xmath87 since we require asymptotic flatness in the asymptotic region @xmath62",
    "this means that the condition @xmath88 must hold for @xmath62 .",
    "consequently , the angular velocity @xmath84 of the throat of the wormhole is given by @xmath89 since @xmath90 is a monotonic function of @xmath12 , we find that @xmath91 , when @xmath49 is positive .",
    "thus as discussed in @xcite @xmath92 . in the case of symmetric wormholes @xmath93 from these considerations we conclude that for wormhole solutions with rotating throat one of the asymptotic regions has to rotate when the other one is static .",
    "an appropriate coordinate transformation for @xmath6 and @xmath94 will make the region @xmath64 non - rotating , but then the region @xmath62 will be rotating .",
    "we now address the location and the geometry of the throat .",

    "this yields @xmath97 for solutions",
    "symmetric with respect to the transformation @xmath98 , the derivatives @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 vanish .",
    "consequently , the throat is located at @xmath15 , and @xmath102 is the hypersurface of minimal area .    in order to characterize the geometry of the throat we first consider the embeddings of the planes @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the metric on such a plane is given by @xmath105 where @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 are cylindrical coordinates on the euclidean embedding space .",
    "regarding @xmath106 and @xmath107 as functions of @xmath12 we find @xmath109 which form a parametric representation of the curve @xmath110 .",
    "thus the circumferential radius of the throat in the planes of rotation is given by @xmath111 .",
    "to characterize the deformation of the throat we also embed a plane which intersects both rotational planes .",
    "this can be achieved by fixing the azimuthal coordinates , @xmath112 , @xmath113 ( mod @xmath114 ) and @xmath115 , @xmath116 ( mod @xmath114),for some @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "this yields another circumferential radius of the throat , @xmath119 .",
    "the ratio @xmath120 then indicates the deformation of the throat due to rotation .",
    "for wormhole solutions symmetric with respect to the transformation @xmath98 , whose throat is located at @xmath81 , we find for this ratio @xmath121 .      since violation of the null energy condition ( nec ) implies violation of the weak and strong energy conditions , we here focus on the nec , which states that @xmath122 where @xmath123 is some ( future - pointing ) null vector field .",

    "the constant @xmath136 determines the mass , @xmath139 for symmetric static wormholes the function @xmath68 is trivial , @xmath140 .",

    "[ fig1 ] in this limit .",
    "their stability will be discussed in the next section .",
    "a generalization of this exact solution for any @xmath0 is given in appendix a.        stationary rotating wormhole solutions emerge smoothly from the static ones when the angular momentum is slowly increased from zero .",
    "an exact solution can be found in this case by treating @xmath147 as a small expansion parameter , see appendix b. to obtain the complete solutions , however , we have to resort to numerical methods .",
    "we introduce the compactified coordinate @xmath148 via @xmath149 at the boundaries the functions @xmath68 and @xmath69 must satisfy the conditions @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "we then solve the system of odes with the boundary conditions @xmath152 to obtain symmetric wormholes , while the boundary conditions @xmath153 lead to non - symmetric solutions ( the approximate form of the symmetric solutions in the asymptotic regions is given in appendix b , together with their expressions near @xmath15 ) .    in the numerical calculations a newton - raphson scheme is employed .",
    "to obtain the branches of rotating solutions , we start from the corresponding static solutions and then increase successively the parameter @xmath49 , while we keep the throat parameter @xmath154 fixed .",
    "let us now consider the solutions themselves and their dependence on the angular momentum . in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] we exhibit the metric functions @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath90 and the scalar function @xmath6 for a set of symmetric wormhole solutions with increasing rotation parameter @xmath49 and fixed throat parameter @xmath154 . in the static case @xmath128 , and the metric functions",

    "the odd metric function @xmath90 , on the other hand , shows a non - monotonic behaviour , when the rotation parameter @xmath49 is varied . the scalar function @xmath6 increases with increasing rotation parameter @xmath49 , tending to zero in the limit of large rotation .",
    "the effect of choosing non - symmetric boundary conditions is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig00 ] , where we display the metric functions @xmath68 and @xmath90 and the scalar function @xmath6 for @xmath145 and the same set of rotation parameters @xmath49 and the throat parameter @xmath154 .",

    "we now turn to the discussion of the global charges of the wormholes . for",
    "fixed throat parameter @xmath154 the mass @xmath71 increases with increasing rotation parameter @xmath49 , while at the same time the scalar charge @xmath41 decreases .",
    "the increase of the mass due to rotation is expected and was observed before in second order perturbation theory @xcite .    to display the properties of the families of rotating wormhole solutions we make use of the scaling symmetry of the equations . for black holes one",
    "usually displays the scaled horizon area versus the scaled angular momentum , where scaling is done with respect to the mass . since the wormholes may have a vanishing mass for a finite throat area , however , we here choose to scale the mass @xmath71 and the angular momentum @xmath155 with respect to the throat area @xmath156 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] we then show the scaled mass @xmath157 as a function of the scaled angular momentum @xmath158 . starting from the value of the scaled mass of the static solution for a given boundary value @xmath159 , the scaled mass increases monotonically with increasing scaled angular momentum .",
    "interestingly , analogous to rotating black holes ( in 4 and 5 dimensions ) , the scaled angular momentum is bounded from above . moreover , as illustrated in the figure , this limiting extremal value is the same for symmetric and non - symmetric wormholes .    in general , the scaled mass",
    "@xmath157 shows a strong dependence on the ( symmetry breaking ) boundary value @xmath159 , increasing monotonically with increasing @xmath159 .",
    "while this dependence is strongest in the static limit , it disappears for the limiting extremal value of the scaled angular momentum @xmath158 .",
    "this indicates that the same limiting solution is approached in all these cases .",
    "note that , whereas the mass , the angular momentum and the area of the throat all diverge for @xmath160 , the scaled mass and scaled angular momentum assume finite values in this limit .    the scaled scalar charge @xmath161 exhibits a somewhat analogous dependence on the scaled angular momentum @xmath158 , as seen in fig .  [ fig1b ] , except that it decreases monotonically with increasing @xmath158 .",
    "again , independent of the boundary value @xmath159 the same value @xmath162 is approached for the limiting extremal value of the scaled angular momentum @xmath158 . since in this limit",
    "the scalar charge vanishes one may expect that the scalar field itself becomes trivial .",
    "the limiting solution should therefore be a vacuum solution in five dimensions with finite mass and equal angular momenta .",
    "the family of rotating vacuum solutions that comes to mind is the set of five - dimensional myers - perry black hole solutions with equal angular momenta , and since we are looking for a limiting extremal solution we are bound to consider the extremal black hole solution . indeed , evaluating the scaled mass and the scaled angular momentum for the extremal myers - perry black hole solution , by scaling with the horizon area @xmath163 , these values precisely match those limiting values of the rotating wormholes .",
    "clearly , the smarr relation also matches in the limit .",
    "inspection of the wormhole solutions themselves then shows that the metric functions approach those of the extremal black hole solutions in the limit .",
    "we demonstrate this for the metric functions @xmath68 and @xmath90 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , by exhibiting the wormhole functions for increasing values of the scaled angular momentum close to the extremal limit , and comparing them with the corresponding extremal black hole metric functions .",
    "as noted above , the scalar field tends to zero in this limit .",

    "interestingly , however , by increasing the angular momentum further , the two unstable modes get closer and finally merge at a critical value @xmath206 of the angular momentum .",
    "the perturbation functions of this critical solution , where the bifurcation takes place , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4a ] for symmetric wormholes with throat parameter @xmath204 .",
    "the dependence of the scaled eigenvalues of the two unstable modes on the scaled angular momentum is exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , both for symmetric wormholes ( @xmath144 ) and non - symmetric wormholes ( @xmath145 ) .",
    "we note that when scaling the eigenvalue also with the metric function @xmath207 , the correspondingly scaled curves depend only on the magnitude of @xmath159 .",
    "we have therefore included this factor in the scaling .",
    "the critical value @xmath206 of the angular momentum depends only on the magnitude of the boundary value @xmath159 and increases with increasing @xmath208 .",
    "thus for non - symmetric wormholes the instability persists to faster rotation .    for symmetric wormholes",
    "the critical value of the scaled angular momentum is @xmath209 , whereas for non - symmetric wormholes with boundary value @xmath210 it is @xmath211 .",
    "beyond @xmath206 we do not find any further unstable modes within the type of modes investigated .",
    "we conclude that if no new unstable modes of a different type appear - and we see no reason why new unstable modes should arise - rotation may stabilize wormholes , if they rotate sufficiently fast . if from a physical point of view the unstable mode would tend to shrink the size of the throat , then beyond the critical value @xmath212 the centrifugal force would be strong enough to inhibit such a shrinkage .",
    "employing a massless phantom field we have constructed wormholes in five spacetime dimensions .",
    "the static solutions have been given in closed form .",
    "for the rotating wormholes we have considered only cohomogeneity-1 solutions . here the two angular momenta - each associated with rotation in one of the two orthogonal planes - have equal magnitude , @xmath213 .",
    "the rotating solutions have been obtained by numerical integration .    for a given size of the throat",
    ", we find a branch of rotating wormholes starting at the corresponding static solution and ending in a limiting extremal solution of maximal angular momentum @xmath155 .",
    "interestingly , this limiting solution corresponds to the extremal myers - perry black hole , whose horizon has the same size as the wormhole throat .",
    "the wormhole solutions satisfy a smarr - like relation , which - for symmetric wormholes - is analogous to the smarr relation of extremal black holes , where the angular velocity of the horizon is replaced by the angular velocity of the throat .",
    "with increasing angular momentum the throat becomes increasingly deformed . for fixed horizon size",
    "this deformation depends only on the angular momentum and is the same for symmetric and non - symmetric wormholes .",
    "the violation of the nec is strongest for static wormholes and decreases with increasing angular momentum .",
    "it decreases to zero when the limiting configuration is approached .",
    "this is expected , since the myers - perry solution has no phantom field and no nec violation .",
    "the stability analysis of the wormhole solutions has revealed surprising features .",
    "a non - normalizable zero mode of the static solutions turns into a normalizable unstable mode , when the wormhole solutions start to rotate .",
    "its frequency then decreases further with increasing angular momentum . on the other hand ,",
    "the frequency of the unstable mode that evolves from the unstable mode of the static solutions , increases with increasing angular momentum .",
    "intriguingly , at a critical value of the angular momentum @xmath206 the two unstable modes then bifurcate and disappear .",
    "we do not find unstable modes beyond @xmath206 .",
    "this indicates that rotation may stabilize wormholes",
    ". it would be interesting to apply the numerical methods of @xcite to study the time evolution of these rotating wormholes .",
    "the next step will be to construct self - consistent wormholes in four dimensions , and to study their stability . representing a cohomogeneity-2 problem",
    ", this analysis will be much more involved .",
    "the current results , however , give us hope as to be able to find stable rotating wormholes .",
    "stability will also be essential in our envisaged study of rotating stars with wormholes at their cores , a problem previously considered only for static stars @xcite .",
    "further astrophysically motivated studies may include the study of the shadow of self - consistent rotating wormholes @xcite .",
    "the static wormhole solutions can be straightforwardly generalized to @xmath214 dimensions , where they can be obtained in analytical form ( see @xcite and appendix a ) .",
    "the rotating solutions on the other hand will need numerical calculations .",
    "cohomogeneity-1 solutions are only present in odd dimensions",
    ". they should be obtainable analogously to the ones presented here @xcite .",
    "rotating wormholes in even dimensions , in contrast , represent at least a cohomogeneity-2 problem , and thus sets of partial differential equations would need to be solved .    finally , based on our results presented here",
    ", we would like to speculate , that in analogy to rotating black holes in @xmath214 dimensions @xcite , which possess no extremal limit , when one of the angular momenta vanishes , the same may hold true for rotating wormholes .",
    "in such a case , the throat might deform strongly , giving rise to gregory - laflamme type instabilities .",
    "then a similar phase structure could arise for higher dimensional rotating wormholes as for black holes , allowing for wormholes with ringlike throats and for composite wormholes .",
