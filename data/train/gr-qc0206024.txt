    "the zeroth and first laws of black hole mechanics apply to equilibrium situations and small departures therefrom . in standard formulations of these laws , black holes in equilibrium",
    "are represented by stationary space - times with regular event horizons ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while this idealization is a natural starting point , from a physical perspective it seems quite restrictive .",
    "( see @xcite for a detailed discussion . ) to overcome this limitation , a new model for a black hole in equilibrium was recently introduced for 3 + 1 ( and higher ) dimensional gravity @xcite .",
    "the generalization is two - fold .",
    "first , one replaces the notion of an event horizon with that of an isolated horizon .",
    "while the former are defined only retroactively using the fully evolved space - time geometry , the latter are defined quasi - locally by suitably constraining the geometry of the horizon surface itself .",
    "second , one drops the requirement that the space - time be stationary and asks only that the horizon be isolated .",
    "that is , the requirement that the black hole be in equilibrium is incorporated by demanding only that no matter or radiation fall through the horizon although the exterior space - time region may well admit radiation .",
    "consequently , the generalization in the class of allowed space - times is enormous . in particular",
    ", space - times admitting isolated horizons need not possess _ any _ killing vector field ; although event horizons of stationary black holes are isolated horizons , they are a very special case",
    ". a recent series of papers @xcite has generalized the laws of black hole mechanics to this broader context .",
    "the notion of isolated horizons has proved to be useful also in other contexts in 3 + 1 dimensions , ranging from numerical relativity to background independent quantum gravity : i ) it plays a key role in an ongoing program for extracting physics from numerical simulations of black hole mergers @xcite ; ii ) it has led to the introduction @xcite of a physical model of hairy black holes , systematizing a large body of results on properties of these black holes which has accumulated from a mixture of analytical and numerical investigations ; and , iii ) it serves as a point of departure for statistical mechanical entropy calculations in which all black holes ( extremal or not ) _ and _ cosmological horizons are incorporated in a single stroke @xcite .    in recent years , 2 + 1-dimensional stationary black holes have drawn a great deal of attention as simplified models for analyzing conceptual issues surrounding black hole thermodynamics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . it is therefore natural to ask if the isolated horizon framework can be constructed and used to extend the standard 2 + 1-dimensional treatments .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to provide such a framework , analyze the resulting horizon geometry in detail and use it to generalize the zeroth and first laws of black hole mechanics .    in section [ s2 ]",
    ", we introduce the definitions of non - expanding and weakly isolated horizons and derive their main consequences , including the generalized zeroth law . while the basic definitions are the same as in higher dimensions , some of their consequences are different because of special features of the 3-dimensional riemannian geometry @xcite .",
    "in particular , the weyl tensor , which plays an important role in higher dimensions , now vanishes identically .",
    "similarly , since in 2 + 1 dimensions black holes exist only if the cosmological constant is non - zero , there is now an inherent length scale in the problem .",
    "however , the spirit of the analysis is the same as in higher dimensions : we extract , from the notion of killing horizons , the minimal structure that is needed to generalize the laws of black hole mechanics . as in 3 + 1 dimensions ,",
    "some of the structure becomes more transparent in terms of null - triads .",
    "therefore , in appendix a we construct the 2 + 1-dimensional analog of the newman - penrose framework @xcite and use it to elucidate the meaning and consequences of our horizon boundary conditions .    in section [ s3 ]",
    "we introduce the action principle , and in section [ s4 ] , the covariant phase space and the associated hamiltonian framework .",
    "while the overall procedure is the same as in higher dimensions @xcite , there is a significant technical complication in the choice of boundary conditions at infinity . in particular , while the electromagnetic potential falls off as @xmath0 in @xmath1 spatial dimensions for @xmath2 , one must now allow it to _ blow up _ logarithmically . since the treatment of these boundary conditions is perhaps the most difficult technical part of our analysis , they are spelled out in detail separately in appendix b.",
    "the end result is that there do exist boundary conditions which suffice to make the action principle , the symplectic structure and the hamiltonians well - defined . using these structures",
    ", we establish the generalized first law . as in higher dimensions",
    ", it arises as a consistency condition for the evolution to be generated by a hamiltonian ; there is thus an infinite family of first laws , one for each time - like vector field in space - time , the evolution along which is hamiltonian .    in section [ s5 ]",
    ", we consider the issue of introducing a canonical notion of horizon energy which can be interpreted as horizon mass . in the hamiltonian framework",
    ", this problem reduces to that of selecting ( for each point in the phase space ) a preferred time - evolution vector field at the horizon .",
    "one expects this choice to vary from one point in the phase space to another ; in the non - rotating case , one would expect the preferred vector field to point along the null normal to the horizon , while in the rotating case , one would expect it to have a non - zero component also along the space - like , rotational direction at the horizon . as in 3 + 1 dimensions , we resolve this problem by making use of known stationary solutions @xcite .",
    "sections [ s3]-[s5 ] focus on the infinite dimensional space of histories and the phase space in presence of weakly isolated horizons . in section [ s6 ] , by contrast",
    ", we consider individual space - times and analyze the geometrical structures and their interplay with field equations at the horizon .",
    "specifically , we first show that non expanding horizons admit a natural derivative operator @xmath3 and study the geometrical information it encodes , beyond the natural degenerate metric , and then use field equations to isolate the freely specifiable parts of @xmath3 on weakly isolated horizons . as in higher dimensions @xcite",
    "we introduce the notion of isolated horizons using the derivative operator @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast to higher dimensions , every non - expanding horizon can be equipped with an isolated horizon structure simply by selecting an appropriate null normal and , generically , this can be achieved in a unique fashion .",
    "readers who are primarily interested in the notions of mass and angular momentum and black hole mechanics can skip this section .",
    "reciprocally , readers who are primarily interested in the horizon geometry and field equations can go directly to section [ s6 ] after section [ s2 ] without loss of continuity .",
    "section [ s7 ] summarizes the main results and points out a subtlety in the definition of mass which arises again because in 2 + 1 dimensions , the electromagnetic potential must be allowed to diverge logarithmically at infinity .    throughout this paper",
    ", we will set @xmath4 . since newton s constant has dimensions of inverse mass in 2 + 1 dimensions , now mass and charge are dimensionless while angular momentum has dimensions of length . as a general rule , arguments and proofs which are parallel to those in higher dimensions",
    "@xcite are only sketched and differences are emphasized .",
    "in this section we will define _ weakly isolated horizons _ and analyze their geometric properties .",
    "it is convenient to proceed in two steps since certain preliminary results are needed to state the final definition .",
    "let @xmath5 be a three dimensional manifold with metric tensor @xmath6 of signature @xmath7 . for simplicity",
    ", we will assume that all manifolds and fields are smooth .",
    "let @xmath8 be a null hypersurface in @xmath9 .",
    "future directed _ null normal to @xmath8 will be denoted by @xmath10 .",
    "the _ expansion _",
    "@xmath11 of @xmath10 is defined by @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the derivative operator on @xmath14 and @xmath15 is any unit , space - like vector field tangent to @xmath8 .",
    "will denote equality restricted to the null surface @xmath8 .",
    "] it is easy to check that the expansion is insensitive to the choice of @xmath15 .",
    "however , as the notation suggests , it does depend on the choice of the null normal @xmath16 ; if @xmath17 , then @xmath18 .",
    "* definition 1 * : a @xmath19-dimensional sub - manifold @xmath8 of a space - time @xmath14 is said to be a _",
    "non - expanding horizon _ if it satisfies the following conditions : + ( i ) @xmath8 is topologically @xmath20 and null ; + ( ii ) the expansion @xmath11 of @xmath10 vanishes on @xmath8 for any null normal @xmath10 ; + ( iii ) all equations of motion hold at @xmath8 and the stress - energy tensor @xmath21 of matter fields at @xmath8 is such that @xmath22 is future directed and causal for any future directed null normal @xmath10 .",
    "+ note that if conditions ( ii ) and ( iii ) hold for one null normal @xmath10 they hold for all .",
    "the role of these conditions is as follows .",
    "the first condition just ensures that the cross - sections of @xmath8 are compact which will in turn ensure that various integrals defining , e.g. , the symplectic structure and various hamiltonians over these cross - sections are well - defined .",
    "the second condition is the crucial one .",
    "it directly implies that all horizon cross - sections have the same length , which , following the terminology in the literature @xcite we will call the ` horizon area ' and denote by @xmath23 .",
    "it will also be convenient to introduce the notion of the _ horizon radius _ @xmath24 , defined by @xmath25 . finally , as we will see below , condition ( ii )",
    "also implies that there is no flux of matter - energy across the horizon and thus captures the intuitive notion that the black hole is isolated .",
    "the last condition , ( iii ) , is analogous to the dynamical conditions one imposes at spatial infinity . while at infinity one requires that the metric ( and other fields ) approach a specific solution to the field equations ( namely , ` the classical vacuum ' ) , at the horizon one",
    "only asks that the field equations be satisfied .",
    "the energy condition involved is very weak ; it follows from the much stronger dominant energy condition normally imposed .",
    "all these conditions are satisfied on any killing horizon ( with a @xmath26 cross - section ) if gravity is coupled to physically reasonable matter ( including perfect fluids , klein - gordon fields , maxwell fields possibly with dilatonic coupling and yang - mills fields )",
    ".    we will now present three examples of non - expanding horizons :    _ example 1 : _ the paradigmatic example of a non - expanding horizon in 2 + 1 dimensions is provided by the btz black holes@xcite .",
    "we begin by showing that the horizons of these space - times trivially satisfy our definition 1 .    in eddington - finkelstein - like",
    "coordinates , the space - time metrics of these black holes are given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 the length @xmath30 being related to the cosmological constant @xmath31 through @xmath32 thus , for any value @xmath31 of the cosmological constant , there is a 2-parameter family of btz metrics , labeled by @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the metric coefficient @xmath35 vanishes at @xmath36 , where @xmath37^{1/2}\\right\\}\\ , .\\ ] ] the 2-surface @xmath38 is the horizon of interest to us .",
    "sometimes it is convenient to have the mass @xmath33 and the angular momentum @xmath34 expressed in terms of @xmath39 and @xmath40 : @xmath41 the surface @xmath42 is null with normal @xmath43 since it is coordinatized by @xmath44 , it has the required topology , @xmath45 . since @xmath10 is a restriction to the horizon of a space - time killing field @xmath46 it follows that @xmath11 vanishes .",
    "finally , the third condition in the definition is trivially satisfied because btz metrics are vacuum solutions to einstein s equation .",
    "_ example 2 : _ the first two conditions in our definition are satisfied by the more general class of metrics ( [ eqn : defefc ] ) , without the restriction ( [ eqn : f ] ) on the form of the function @xmath47 . if the function @xmath47 is chosen to satisfy the weak condition @xmath48 , the third condition in the definition is also satisfied .",
    "thus , we have a very large class of _ generalized btz metrics _ which admit a non - expanding horizon .",
    "this class includes , in particular , the metrics introduced in @xcite .",
    "_ example 3 : _ our final example is the charged , rotating black hole solution first discovered by clment @xcite .",
    "( it was later independently found by martinez , teitelboim and zanelli ( mtz ) @xcite , who also analyzed its physical properties . )",
    "it is again a stationary axi - symmetric solution and is expressed in terms of three parameters , @xmath49 . as shown in section [ s5.2 ] , they can be traded for mass @xmath33 , angular momentum @xmath34 and charge @xmath50 . however , as in higher dimensional dilatonic black holes , the dependence of @xmath33 and @xmath34 on the parameters appearing explicitly in the solution is quite complicated ( see section [ s5 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , in this case , the electro - magnetic fields and the metric coefficients _ diverge _ ( logarithmically ) at infinity .",
    "hence the very meaning of mass and angular momentum is not a priori transparent .",
    "finally , if one simply sets @xmath51 , one obtains the btz metric with @xmath52 and @xmath53 ; to obtain the non - trivial solutions in the btz family , a more subtle limit has to be taken .",
    "clment gave the metric in the form : @xmath54 where the functions @xmath55 and @xmath56 are given by @xmath57 the maxwell field is given by : @xmath58 in the eddington - finkelstein - like coordinates the metric becomes @xmath59 ( as is usual in the passage to the eddington - finkelstein type coordinates in the _ stationary _ context , the angle @xmath60 in ( @xmath61 ) is not the same as the one in ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "in the analysis of the horizon structure , we will use ( [ efm ] ) . ) it is straightforward to check that the 2-surfaces @xmath63 , co - ordinatized by @xmath64 , are non - expanding horizons .",
    "although the conditions imposed in definition 1 seem rather weak , they have a number of interesting consequences .",
    "to explore them it is often convenient to introduce , as in the newman - penrose framework , a triad consisting of vectors @xmath65 and @xmath15 in the neighborhood of the horizon @xmath8 .",
    "the vectors @xmath66 and @xmath67 are null and @xmath15 , space - like .",
    "we choose @xmath66 to be a future pointing null normal of the horizon and then normalize @xmath67 by requiring @xmath68 and @xmath15 by requiring @xmath69 .",
    "all other contractions vanish .",
    "( thus , in contrast to the 3 + 1 dimensional np framework , @xmath15 is now real and space - like rather than complex and null . ) on the horizon we further require @xmath15 to be tangential to the horizon .",
    "given such a triad , we can introduce np - like coefficients as in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "appendix [ sec : np2plus1 ] gives the corresponding definitions and a summary of important relations for these coefficients .",
    "it is often convenient to use the triad so that the pull - back to @xmath8 of the 1-form @xmath70 is orthogonal to @xmath26 cross - sections of @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath71 ( so that , in the np - like framework of appendix c , @xmath72 ) .",
    "we will explicitly specify when this restriction is made .",
    "we will conclude this subsection with a brief discussion of geometric structures available on non - expanding horizons .",

    "this is an extremely special situation .",
    "to summarize , in contrast to higher dimensions , _ every _ non - expanding horizon admits an isolated horizon structure which furthermore is unique except in extremely special cases .",
    "in this paper , we introduced the notion of non - expanding , weakly isolated and isolated horizons in 2 + 1-dimensional gravity ( sections [ s2 ] and [ s6 ] ) , analyzed geometry of these horizons ( sections [ s2 ] and [ s6 ] ) , and extended the zeroth and first laws of black hole mechanics to weakly isolated horizons ( sections [ s3 ] , [ s4 ] and [ s5 ] ) .",
    "the methods used were the same as those employed in higher dimensions @xcite and the overall results are also analogous . in particular , the first law again arises as a necessary and sufficient condition for the evolution along a given space - time vector field @xmath272 to preserve the symplectic structure in the phase space , i.e. , to be hamiltonian .",
    "when they exist , the hamiltonians are given by a sum of two surface terms , one at infinity and the other at the horizon .",
    "the term at infinity , @xmath291 , represents the total energy of the system , while the horizon term , @xmath313 , provides an expression of the horizon energy , both defined by @xmath272 .",
    "there is an infinite number of vector fields providing hamiltonian evolution , each with its horizon energy and the corresponding first law .",
    "using our knowledge of the stationary axi - symmetric black hole solutions in 2 + 1 dimensions , for each space - time in our phase space , we can single out a preferred evolution field @xmath463 on @xmath8 and identify the corresponding horizon energy @xmath464 as the ` horizon mass ' .",
    "the corresponding first law is then the ` canonical ' first law for mechanics of weakly isolated horizons .",
    "there are , however , certain subtle but important differences from higher dimensions .",
    "these arise because of : i ) the peculiarities of 3 dimensional riemannian geometry ( particularly the fact that the weyl tensor vanishes identically ) ; ii ) the fact that the first homology class of the horizon is now non - trivial ( because the topology of @xmath8 is @xmath465 ) ; and , more importantly , iii ) the boundary conditions _ at infinity _ , which are rather different from those in higher dimensions ( especially the ones satisfied by the electromagnetic potential ) .",
    "the first two of these factors required us to modify our constructions and proofs at several points in sections [ s2 ] and [ s6 ] .",
    "the third difference added a number of complications and twists in sections [ s3 ] , [ s4 ] and [ s5 ] .",
    "we will conclude with a brief discussion of an additional subtlety which is not discussed in the main text .    in higher dimensions ,",
    "it is natural to require that the electromagnetic potential @xmath187 go to zero at infinity , a condition which freezes the asymptotic gauge freedom . in 2 + 1 dimensions , by contrast , since @xmath187 diverges logarithmically when the electric charge is non - zero , gauge freedom persists at infinity . for concreteness and pedagogical simplicity , we chose to fix it ` by hand ' by specifying a precise asymptotic behavior of @xmath187 ( see appendix b ) .",
    "had we retained this freedom , all our discussion would have gone through .",
    "the expressions of the symplectic structure and angular momentum would have remained unchanged .",
    "however , the electromagnetic scalar potential @xmath466 would then have inherited an ambiguity in the clment solution and this ambiguity would have trickled down in the final expression of the horizon mass @xmath322 for general space - times . thus , because the maxwell potentials diverge logarithmically , the horizon mass is in fact ambiguous in presence of a non - zero electric charge .",
    "is such that , asymptotically , @xmath467 must be of the form @xmath468 for some function @xmath302 only of electric charge .",
    "therefore as in section [ s5.1 ] , in presence of a non - zero electric charge , there is a freedom to add a function of charge to the scalar potential @xmath287 .",
    "if we do nt fix the gauge at infinity , this ambiguity persists also in the clment solution and we are now led to add an arbitrary function of charge to the expression ( [ mass3 ] ) of mass , subject only to the condition that this function tend to zero in the limit of zero charge . ] in the main text , for simplicity of presentation , we eliminated this ambiguity by hand through a specific choice of boundary conditions on @xmath187 .",

    "our choice of asymptotic conditions is dictated by the following stringent requirements : i ) all explicitly known stationary black hole solutions ( that we are aware of ) belong to the phase - space defined by these conditions ; ii ) for fields satisfying these asymptotic conditions , the action is finite ( on- and off - shell ) and differentiable ; iii ) on the full phase , the hamiltonian is finite ( on- and off - shell ) and differentiable ; iv ) the symplectic structure is well - defined ; and , v ) the boundary conditions are preserved by the infinitesimal evolution .      in this case , the btz solutions naturally provide the required background fields .",
    "thus , we assume that a neighborhood of infinity of every space - time of interest is diffeomorphic to a neighborhood of infinity of the btz space - time .",
    "then , in terms of the btz coordinates @xmath537 , we can specify the background co - triads and connection : @xmath538 where @xmath539 is a constant internal triad , satisfying our orthogonality and normalization conditions with the fixed internal metric @xmath201 .",
    "an appropriate set of fall - off conditions on the deviations @xmath540 and @xmath541 is given by : @xmath542 where , in the lagrangian framework , we consider only such histories for which variations of the constants fall - off as @xmath543 at infinity .      to accommodate non - zero angular momentum _ and _ charge , a considerably more complicated choice of the background fields is needed .",
    "a natural strategy would be to replace the btz background with that provided by the clment solution .",
    "thus , for the co - triad we are led to choose @xmath544 and , for the maxwell field , @xmath545 where , although the form of @xmath546 is determined by that of the background connection , we have displayed it explicitly for convenience .",
    "the fall - off conditions on the permissible deviations are given by @xmath547 in these conditions , the parameters @xmath50 , @xmath94 and @xmath290 do not depend on the coordinates @xmath548 and we consider only such histories in the lagrangian formulation for which the variations of these parameters vanish at infinity at the rate @xmath543",
    ".    we will conclude by pointing out a subtlety with respect to the boundary condition on the electromagnetic vector potential @xmath549 . in higher dimensions",
    ", one can simply require that @xmath187 should vanish at spatial infinity . in 2 + 1 dimensions , by contrast",
    ", if the electric charge is non - zero , @xmath187 necessarily diverges logarithmically .",
    "now , the asymptotic form of @xmath187 is not fixed a priori by physical considerations ; there is a possibility of making a gauge transformation : @xmath550 which can be non - trivial at infinity . for the hamiltonian framework of the main text to be well - defined ,",
    "however , the asymptotic form of @xmath131 is restricted ; @xmath551 must be of the form @xmath468 at infinity .",
    "note that the coefficient of @xmath552 must be constant in any given space - time and can only depend on the charge ; if it depended on other parameters @xmath94 and @xmath341 then the term at infinity in ( [ xt2 ] ) would not be an exact variation and we would not be able to define energy at infinity .",
    "nonetheless , we do have a restricted gauge freedom . in this appendix , for concreteness and pedagogical simplicity , we simply eliminated it ` by hand ' through our boundary conditions at infinity .",
    "had we retained this freedom , all our discussion would have gone through .",
    "the expressions of the symplectic structure and angular momentum would have remained unchanged .",
    "however , the scalar potential @xmath287 would then have inherited an ambiguity in the clment solution through the undetermined @xmath309 and this ambiguity would have trickled down in the final expression of the horizon mass @xmath322 for general space - times .",
    "thus , because the maxwell potentials diverge logarithmically , a priori the horizon mass is ambiguous in presence of a non - zero electric charge . in the main text , for simplicity , we chose to eliminate this ambiguity by hand through a specific choice of boundary conditions , i.e. , by fixing the maxwell gauge at infinity .",
