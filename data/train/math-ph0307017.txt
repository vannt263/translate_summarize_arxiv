    "some time ago , motivated by the study of dilute lattice models @xcite , grimm and pearce @xcite introduced generalisations of certain diagram algebras ( algebras with a diagrammatic formulation @xcite ) , such as temperley - lieb  @xcite and murakami - birman - wenzl  @xcite algebras .",
    "these algebras are important in the theory of solvable lattice models of two - dimensional statistical mechanics @xcite and are related to link and knot invariants @xcite .",
    "the generalisation was conceived on the diagram level by introducing diagrams with lines in a number of colours .",
    "each algebra was then described by generators and relations dictated , or at least suggested , by the requirement of solving the yang - baxter equations . however the diagrammatic ( which is to say , topological ) underpinning was not precisely formalised .",
    "the classes of solvable lattice models called dilute lattice models @xcite whose discovery motivated this generalisation are closely linked to models of dilute loops on a lattice @xcite .",
    "these models attract particular interest because they contain a solvable ` companion ' of the two - dimensional ising model in a magnetic field @xcite  one of the famous unsolved problems in statistical mechanics .",
    "the idea here is to consider two colours , and to regard the second colour merely as a dilution of the first .    in the two colour case",
    "the requirement of solving the yang - baxter equations is fully satisfied by the design of the relations .",
    "the yang - baxter equations are sufficient to guarantee solvability in the sense of commuting transfer matrices @xcite",
    ". thus representations of such algebras give rise to solvable dilute and two - colour lattice models .",
    "( more precisely , one has relations for a _ tower _ of algebras , and the representation must be defined for the whole tower . ) various explicit representations and associated models are considered in @xcite .",
    "the representations found included previously known lattice models @xcite , but also gave rise to new series of solvable lattice models @xcite .",
    "however , little else was discovered about these algebras and their structures .",
    "we have generators and relations , and enough representations to show that these relations do not imply a trivial algebra , but no knowledge of dimensions or even finiteness , and no analysis of irreducible representations .",
    "to this extent the representations which _ were _ found were a matter of luck , and there was no way to tell if the relations could engender other important but undiscovered models .",
    "this may be contrasted with our quite complete knowledge of the representation theory of the temperley - lieb algebra itself , which is strikingly rich and beautiful , and important in several areas of mathematics and physics @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we define a new algebra  the _ bubble _ algebra .",
    "we define this algebra entirely diagrammatically , such that it is amenable to the general method of @xcite,@xcite .",
    "we then show that this gives a properly constituted diagrammatic realisation of the grimm - pearce multi - colour temperley - lieb  algebra ( i.e.  it solves the yang - baxter equations ) .",
    "we hence use the general method to determine the generic representation theory of these algebras completely .",
    "we set up the machinery to investigate their exceptional representation theory ( analogous to that of ordinary hecke algebras at @xmath0 a root of unity ) .",
    "we show how irreducible representations may be associated to physical observables in the corresponding lattice models .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the implications of our results for bethe ansatz on models derived using this algebra .",
    "we mainly discuss the case of two colours , as the further generalisation to more colours is straightforward .",
    "( the case of one colour is the original temperley - lieb  algebra . )",
    "generalisations of the temperley - lieb  algebra are two - a - penny @xcite , however there are now a number of reasons for looking at the algebras introduced in @xcite again .",
    "firstly , the diagram form of the temperley - lieb  algebra is a deep and powerful property ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , and our new realisation provides a natural generalisation on the diagram level .",
    "secondly , they provide solutions of the yang - baxter equation as we have said .",
    "they are similar in some ways to the blob algebra , which has recently been shown @xcite to be useful in solving the reflection equation @xcite .",
    "we also expect them to be of use in constructing integrable boundary conditions for certain solvable lattice models , including ` conformal twisted ' boundary conditions @xcite , and thus to be of relevance to boundary conformal field theory .",
    "thirdly , we show that they are part of a class of algebras amenable to the methods of @xcite , so that we may now analyse them quite efficiently ( and hence provide a uniform theory of such algebras ) .",
    "this analysis suggests ( see later ) that they may be relevant for statistical mechanics on ladders ( cf .",
    "recent works @xcite ) , and indeed , just recently , this was shown to be the case @xcite .",
    "they also look like they should be relevant for circuit design and even transport network design ( although we know of no example of their use in these areas ! ) as we will see .",
    "there are also similarities with murakami - birman - wenzl  algebras @xcite and fuss - catalan algebras @xcite , both of which have been used to construct integrable systems , to the extent that the same methods are applicable there .",
    "finally , they have a number of features of technical interest in representation theory ( we largely postpone comment on these to a separate paper , but see section  6 for a brief discussion ) .",
    "we start with some definitions .",
    "our new algebra is a diagram algebra  an algebra with a diagrammatic formulation akin to the temperley - lieb algebra @xcite",
    ". it will be convenient to recall this familiar example in a suitable formalism , and then generalise to our case .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    fix a rectangular subset of @xmath1 such that there is an edge with a north pointing normal ( e.g. @xmath2\\times[0,1]$ ] ) .",
    "label each edge by the direction ( nsew ) of its normal .",
    "consider the set of partitions of this rectangle by finitely many continuous non - crossing lines ( walls ) with no wall touching the e or w edge .",
    "we define an equivalence relation on this set by equivalencing two such partitions if they differ only by a continuous edge preserving deformation of the rectangle .",
    "we call ( representatives of ) equivalence classes",
    "_ diagrams_.",
    "we say we can _ compose _ two such partitions , @xmath3 over @xmath4 , if there lie in their equivalence classes two diagrams such that when @xmath3 is juxtaposed with @xmath4 from above , the southern endpoints of lines in @xmath3 coincide with the northern endpoints of lines in @xmath4 ( nb , this requires only that the _ number _ of lines matches up ) .",
    "each point of coincidence may then be regarded as an interior point of a continuous line passing though the juxtaposition @xmath5 .",
    "the composite @xmath6 is the new partition of the combined region which results from this .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    consider the subset of diagrams where there are precisely @xmath7 endpoints on each northern and each southern edge . for @xmath0 an invertible indeterminate , consider the @xmath8$]-linear extension of this set .",
    "let @xmath9 denote the quotient of _ this _ set by the relation which equivalences any diagram with a closed ( interior ) loop to @xmath10 times the same diagram without , where @xmath11 .",
    "note that @xmath9 has basis the set of diagrams where there are precisely @xmath7 endpoints on each northern and each southern edge , _ and no interior loops_. note that the composition of diagrams passes to a well defined composition on this set , making it a @xmath8$]-algebra .",
    "fix @xmath12 a field which is a @xmath8$]-algebra ( for example , the complex numbers , with @xmath0 acting as some specified nonzero complex number ) .",
    "the _ temperley - lieb  algebra _",
    "@xmath13 is the @xmath12-algebra @xmath14 } { t_{n,{\\mathbb{z}}}}$ ] .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    a line in a diagram with one endpoint in the northern ( n ) edge and one in the s edge is called a _ propagating _ line .",
    "the identity element of @xmath13 is the unique diagram all of whose lines are propagating .",
    "there are a number of ways of embedding @xmath15 as a subalgebra in @xmath16",
    ". we will call that embedding which maps @xmath17 to the same diagram , but with one extra propagating line on the right , the _ natural _ embedding .    for brevity",
    "we will assume familiarity with the usual presentation of @xmath16 by generators @xmath18 and relations , and the correspondence with the diagram version ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the topological / diagram realisation of the temperley - lieb  algebra is enormously useful @xcite and deep @xcite .",
    "we require a similarly clearcut and intuitive construction , let us call it a _ model _",
    ", for the algebra introduced in @xcite . here",
    "we will concentrate mainly on the model for two colours .",
    "the generalisation to arbitrarily many colours will be obvious .",
    "a generalisation to the murakami - birman - wenzl  version is also possible .    before we introduce the model note that the temperley - lieb  diagrams described above may be regarded as partitionings of the set of endpoints into pairs .",
    "the non - crossing rule means that they are a proper subset of the set @xmath19 of all such pair partitionings in general .",
    "the full set @xmath19 is a basis for the brauer algebra @xmath20 @xcite ( whose composition rule need not concern us here ) .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    now consider the set each element of which consists of two independent ( but simultaneous ) partitionings of a rectangle as above ( one , say , with red lines , one with blue ) . here",
    "independence means that walls of different colours may cross , but we will _ exclude _ elements in which such crossings occur on the frame of the rectangle .",
    "we define an equivalence essentially as before , so for example ( locally ) @xmath21 but ( because of the exclusion ) not on the frame : @xmath22 this is as if we have two parallel but independent deformable rectangles ( one for each colour ) , but they share the frame . another way to think of this is as lines embedded not just in a rectangle , but in bubble wrap ( bubble wrap is made from two sheets of polythene welded together along certain lines to trap bubbles ) .",
    "red lines are allowed on the welds and the back sheet , blue lines are allowed on the welds and the front sheet : @xmath23 in this realisation lines on the same sheet ( or on the weld ) are not allowed to touch , but otherwise may be deformed isotopically as before .",
    "accordingly , we call the deformation equivalence ` bubble isotopy ' .",
    "again we define composition whenever the number of endpoints ( irrespective of colour ) matches up .",
    "we do this as follows .",
    "we call the match up _ precise _ if the colours match up precisely ( i.e.we can identify the touching edges and have a properly formed two - colour partition ) .",
    "the composite is 0 unless the colours match up precisely .",
    "if they _ do _ match up the composite _ is _ that two - colour partition .",
    "consider the subset of double partitionings in which the total number of endpoints ( red _ and _ blue ) on the northern edge is @xmath7 , and similarly on the southern edge .",
    "the _ bubble algebra _ @xmath24 ( so named to emphasise the topological diagram underpinning ) is the @xmath25$]-linear extension of this set and composition , with internal closed loop replacements ( as in @xmath13 ) .",
    "thus @xmath24 has a basis , @xmath26 say , of two - colour partitions ( up to bubble isotopy ) with no internal loops .",
    "the loop replacement scalar @xmath10 here depends on the colour : @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "fix a field @xmath12 which is a @xmath25$]-algebra as before ( e.g.  the complex numbers with @xmath29 specified complex numbers ) .",
    "denote the @xmath12-algebra @xmath30 } { t_{n,{\\mathbb{z}}}}^2 $ ] by @xmath31 .    the obvious generalisations @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) include @xmath34 .",
    "[ [ section-4 ] ]    let @xmath35 denote the number of * r*ed propagating lines in diagram @xmath36 ( and similarly for * b*lue ) . extend this to apply to any non - zero scalar multiple of @xmath36 .",

    "we say that two lines are _ strictly _ non - crossing when they are non - crossing even when projected into a single plane ( so as to recover grimm and pearce s original diagrams ) .",
    "write @xmath49 for the subset of @xmath40 with lines all strictly non - crossing , and define @xmath50 similarly .",
    "for example @xmath51 is the set of diagrams with all lines propagating and strictly non - crossing",
    ". it will be evident that @xmath52 , and that @xmath53 is an orthogonal idempotent decomposition of the identity element of @xmath54 .    if @xmath55 , let @xmath56 denote the same diagram except with one extra non - crossing propagating red ( resp .",
    "blue ) line to the right of all other lines .",
    "thus @xmath57 and @xmath58 are injective maps on bases , which extend to injective maps from @xmath59 to @xmath54 .",
    "note that these maps do not preserve the identity element .",
    "there is , however , an inclusion @xmath60 given by @xmath61 which we will call the ` natural ' inclusion by analogy with the @xmath16 case .",
    "[ [ section-5 ] ]    the basis @xmath26 may be constructed systematically for each @xmath7 from that for @xmath62 using some simple combinatorial devices which we will describe shortly .",
    "examples : the basis @xmath63 of @xmath64 consists of the following diagrams @xmath65    the basis @xmath66 of @xmath67 consists of the following diagrams @xmath68 in particular @xmath69 consists of the diagrams in the middle row ; @xmath70 consists only of the leftmost diagram in the top row ; and @xmath71 the rightmost .",
    "the remaining diagrams are in @xmath72 , thus @xmath73 .",
    "let us write @xmath74 for the rightmost diagram in the middle row of @xmath66 diagrams above , and also for the image of this diagram under @xmath75 ( or arbitrary compositions of @xmath75 ) .",
    "let @xmath76 be a sequence in @xmath77 of length @xmath78 , then write @xmath79 for the following element of @xmath26 : @xmath80 ( in this example @xmath81 ) .",
    "in the sections _ after _ this one we will return to discussing the general algebra basis and irreducible representation theory . first let us briefly look at how the algebra can be used to build solutions to the yang - baxter equations .",
    "we will need to start with some notation and definitions .",
    "consider the ordinary spin chain representation @xcite of the one colour temperley - lieb algebra .",
    "choose a basis @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and define @xmath86 we can think of this as a product of a bra and a ket @xmath87 where @xmath88      we now describe a ( highly reducible ) representation of the two colour algebra .",
    "this is a representation on the tensor product space @xmath89 .",
    "we specify the representation by giving the explicit representation matrices of the ten elements of the basis @xmath90 of @xmath91 on @xmath92 .",
    "the representation matrices are thus @xmath93 matrices , with entries that now depend on two parameters @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the matrices are given in the basis @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 of @xmath112 , where @xmath113 and @xmath4 refer to the two colours , and we have an additional variable living on the lines which you may think of as an arrow pointing up ( @xmath114 ) or down ( @xmath115 ) , as in the usual spin chain representation of the temperley - lieb  algebra , compare equation .",
    "the representation matrices for the elements with two propagating straight red or blue lines are diagonal , with elements @xmath116 those for two crossing lines of different colour are @xmath117 finally , there are four colourings of the usual temperley - lieb generators .",
    "these can again be written as products of kets and bras , just as in equation for the one colour case , @xmath118 where now @xmath119      let us elaborate on this by means of an explicit example . from certain representations of the two - colour bubble algebra , we can derive integrable vertex models . in the simplest scenario ,",
    "these vertex models correspond to @xmath120-matrix solutions of the yang - baxter equation @xmath121 which is an equation on a triple tensor product space @xmath122 , with @xmath120 acting on @xmath123 . a particular vertex model on the square lattice",
    "is specified by the matrix elements of @xmath124 , which correspond to the boltzmann weights of the respective local configurations ( the variable @xmath125 is the spectral parameter ) .",
    "the transfer matrices @xmath126 are built from elementary matrices @xmath124 , so as to act on the @xmath127-fold tensor product @xmath128 .",
    "they commute for different values of @xmath125 .",
    "the free energy of the vertex model is then obtained from the largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix , and we are particularly interested in its behaviour as @xmath127 tends to infinity .",
    "the @xmath120-matrix @xmath129 expressed in terms of generators of the ( one - colour ) temperley - lieb algebra with @xmath130 , is a well - known example of a solution of the yang - baxter equation @xcite .",
    "in fact it follows from the relations in the temperley - lieb algebra that this combination satisfies the yang - baxter equation .",
    "hence this ` baxterisation ' shows that any representation of the temperley - lieb algebra with a large @xmath127 limit yields a solvable lattice model of statistical mechanics . for the representation at hand ,",
    "this model is the well - known six - vertex model , and the @xmath120-matrix is related to the affine lie algebra @xmath131 @xcite .",
    "let us now move on to the two - colour case .",
    "the @xmath120-matrix @xcite @xmath132 + \\frac{\\sin(3\\lambda - u)}{\\sin(3\\lambda ) } \\left [ \\pmatrix{\\raisebox{-4pt}{\\includegraphics{rbd.eps}}}+ \\pmatrix{\\raisebox{-4pt}{\\includegraphics{brd.eps } } } \\right]\\nonumber\\\\ \\fl & & -\\frac{\\sin(u)\\sin(2\\lambda - u)}{\\sin(\\lambda)\\sin(3\\lambda ) } \\left [ \\pmatrix{\\raisebox{-4pt}{\\includegraphics{rr.eps}}}+ \\pmatrix{\\raisebox{-4pt}{\\includegraphics{bb.eps } } } \\right ] + \\frac{\\sin(u)}{\\sin(3\\lambda ) } \\left [ \\pmatrix{\\raisebox{-4pt}{\\includegraphics{rb.eps}}}+ \\pmatrix{\\raisebox{-4pt}{\\includegraphics{br.eps } } } \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\ \\fl & & + \\frac{\\sin(u)\\sin(3\\lambda - u)}{\\sin(\\lambda)\\sin(3\\lambda ) } \\left [ \\pmatrix{\\raisebox{-4pt}{\\includegraphics{rbx.eps}}}+ \\pmatrix{\\raisebox{-4pt}{\\includegraphics{brx.eps } } } \\right ] \\label{baxterisation}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath133 , satisfies the yang - baxter equation as a consequence of the relations of the bubble algebra .",
    "thus any representation of the two - colour bubble algebra on a tensor product space @xmath128 with @xmath134 gives rise to an integrable vertex model with an @xmath120 matrix given by equation with boltzmann weights that are trigonometric functions of the spectral parameter @xmath125 .",
    "for the representation at hand , the @xmath120 matrix turns out to be related to the affine lie algebra c@xmath135 @xcite .",
    "it differs from the vertex model of @xcite by a spectral - parameter - dependent gauge transformation @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath26 is somewhat like the brauer diagram basis @xmath19 of the brauer algebra @xmath20 @xcite , which in turn contains the diagram basis of @xmath16 . from each ` seed ' element of the brauer basis",
    "we can get some number ( 0 or more ) of diagrams of @xmath26 by colouring the lines in the following way . first put a total order on the @xmath7 lines ( any one will do  for definiteness we will number the line coming out of the top left endpoint 1 , then number other lines 2,3 , .. as they first appear reading clockwise round the frame ) .",
    "each line , considered in this order , may be coloured red or blue , unless it crosses one or more already coloured lines , in which case it must be coloured in a colour _ distinct _ from those of all the crossing lines .",
    "of course , if there are three or more lines in the diagram this may not be possible ( i.e.  when a line crosses both of a pair of crossed lines ) , in which case there are _ no _ coloured brauer diagrams of this type in @xmath26 .    apart from the seeds with no possible colourings , each seed produces @xmath136 elements of @xmath26 , where @xmath137 is the number of lines in the seed which are either without any crossings , or are the first line in their crossed cluster ( i.e.  the line whose colour is chosen freely ) .",
    "[ [ section-6 ] ]    as with @xmath16 @xcite there is a bra - ket construction .",
    "imagine cutting the bubble in half ( i.e.  cutting through the front and back sheets , leaving a top and bottom piece each with y cross - section )",
    ". it will be evident that it is possible to do this such that only propagating lines are cut , and these once each .",
    "note that given two pieces in this way , because of the non - crossing within a layer rule , there is a unique way of recombining them , i.e.  recovering the original diagram .",
    "indeed any bra- ( top piece ) and -ket ( bottom piece ) such that the number of cut lines matches up ( on each sheet of the bubble separately ) may be combined in a unique way .",
    "for example @xmath138 that is , writing @xmath139 for the set of bra pieces obtained by cutting elements of @xmath140 ( and similarly @xmath141 for the set of ket pieces ) , then any element @xmath3 of @xmath139 may be combined with any element @xmath4 of @xmath141 in a unique way to make a diagram @xmath6 in @xmath140 : @xmath142    [ [ section-7 ] ]    following @xcite , we define certain injective homomorphisms of bra sets for any appropriate @xmath143 : @xmath144 takes a diagram @xmath36 to a diagram differing from @xmath36 only in having an additional red propagating line at the right hand end ; @xmath145 similarly , but adding a blue line ; for @xmath146 @xmath147 takes a diagram @xmath36 to a diagram differing from @xmath36 only in having the southern endpoint of the last ( rightmost ) red propagating line in @xmath36 turn back to form a new rightmost northern vertex ; and @xmath148 similarly for the last blue line .",
    "it will be evident that @xmath149 ( any undefined set here to be interpreted as the empty set ) .",
    "[ [ section-8 ] ]    it will be convenient to be able to depict the sum of two diagrams in @xmath26 differing only in the colour of one line by drawing any one of these diagrams with the relevant line replaced by a thick line ( called a _ white _ line ) .",
    "we will generalise this so that a diagram with two white lines is a sum of four diagrams from @xmath26 , and so on .",
    "let us write @xmath150 for that diagram which has the same shape as the diagram @xmath151 , but has all white lines .",

    "[ [ section-9 ] ]    it will be evident from equation that there is a filtration of @xmath54 by ideals with sections spanned by diagrams having fixed numbers of propagating lines  and hence having the subsets @xmath158 as bases .    note in particular from equation that @xmath159 has basis @xmath160 = \\cup_{i \\leq n-2 } b_n(i)$ ] ; @xmath161 has basis @xmath162 $ ] ; and so on .",

    "each such section breaks up as a sum of isomorphic left modules each with basis of the form @xmath171 where @xmath172 varies over all possibilities and @xmath4 is fixed .",
    "( there is obviously a parallel construction for right modules . )",
    "we denote ( any representative of ) the equivalence class of these summands @xmath173 .",
    "these left modules are called _ standard _ modules .",

    "note the following .",
    "[ [ section-11 ] ]    the construction of standard modules is independent of the choice of field .",

    "thus in particular the fact that `` the sum of the dimensions of all the factors of @xmath3 is the dimension of @xmath3 itself '' becomes `` the dimension at @xmath3 is the sum of the dimensions of the nearest neighbours of @xmath3 on the graph ( possibly with multiplicities ) '' .",

    "this does not spoil the counting if we are careful ( each vertex corresponds to irreducibles in more than one algebra , but , on fixing a given algebra , that vertex becomes unambiguous ) .",
    "[ [ section-14 ] ]    in our algebra we see that the standard modules play a special role , somewhat akin to that of simple modules , although over an arbitrary field they are not themselves necessarily simple .    the bratteli _ basis diagram _ of such an algebra is a certain embellished graph , each vertex of which corresponds to a standard module label ( in this case the label consists of @xmath7 and a propagating index @xmath227 ) ; and each edge of which corresponds to a factor in the restriction of that module to @xmath62 ( as above ) .",
    "each vertex is embellished with a depiction of a basis for the corresponding standard module .",
    "a _ foreshortened _ bratteli basis diagram is a bratteli basis diagram viewed from such a direction as to cause certain vertices to coincide . in our case",

    "such a diagram , where _ possible _ to draw , contains essentially complete information on the generic representation theory of the algebra .",
    "the ( foreshortened ) bratteli basis diagram for @xmath228 begins @xmath229 it may be helpful to emphasise that here the basis element @xmath230 could also be written @xmath231  in the bra form these are equivalent , since the red and blue lines are not on the same bubble layer .",
    "if an algebra is semisimple ( as ours is generically ) then its total dimension is the sum of the squares of the dimensions of the irreducibles .",
    "here we see , for any @xmath12 , that the total dimension is the sum of the squares of the dimensions of the standards .",
    "thus the entire combinatoric is encoded in the pictures .",
    "every possible diagram is built bra - ket from the kets in the foreshortened bratteli diagram ( and their descendents ) .",
    "[ [ section-15 ] ]    in the ordinary temperley - lieb  case it is the non - semisimple exceptions ( @xmath0 root of unity ) which are of most interest .",
    "we conclude by setting up machinery to investigate this case ( again paralleling martin s usual approach @xcite to temperley - lieb  and its generalisations ) .",
    "we may use a little category theory to very efficiently rederive the generic representation theory of @xmath54 given above , in such a way that it can readily be extended to the exceptional cases .",
    "recall @xmath150 from section  [ sbasis ] and let @xmath232 .",
    "note that @xmath233 a diagrammatic version of this follows from the representation of @xmath234 by @xmath235 ( all lines ` white ' ) so that @xmath236    note that @xmath234 commutes with @xmath237 so that @xmath238 is a left @xmath54 right @xmath239-bimodule .",

    "that is , they are also the simple modules of the quotient algebra @xmath249 .",
    "to reiterate , equation gives what is called a full embedding of @xmath239 in @xmath54 .",
    "this means that there is a natural injection of @xmath250 into @xmath251  another reason for the foreshortening of the bratteli diagram .",
    "it also means that most of the representation theory of @xmath54 follows from that of @xmath239 via a little elementary category theory  and hence inductively from the trivial cases @xmath252 and @xmath64 .",
    "note that @xmath253 includes every diagram except those with exactly @xmath7 propagating lines .",
    "thus @xmath249 is spanned by the set @xmath254 of diagrams with exactly @xmath7 propagating lines .",
    "let @xmath255 denote an index set for the simple modules of @xmath54 , and @xmath256 an index set for the quotient algebra @xmath257 .",
    "so long as @xmath234 may be renormalised as an idempotent it follows that @xmath258 where the union is disjoint .",
    "the full embedding allows us to inject @xmath259 in precisely the way implied by the foreshortening of our foreshortened bratteli diagram .    by equation , we know @xmath255 if we know @xmath260 for all @xmath261",
    "we now determine this set .",
    "note that @xmath262 is a subalgebra of @xmath54 .",
    "let @xmath263 denote this subalgebra , then @xmath264 is a sequence of algebra morphisms .",
    "the composite morphism takes an element of @xmath254 to the same object regarded as a basis element of @xmath249 , hence it is an isomorphism .",
    "provided our ground field @xmath12 has characteristic different from two ( we are mainly interested in @xmath265 , with characteristic zero , of course ) this algebra may be identified with a certain quotient of the wreath product group algebra @xmath266 , where @xmath267 denotes the cyclic group of order two and @xmath268 the symmetric group ( permutation group of @xmath7 elements ) of order @xmath269 , as follows .",
    "elements of @xmath270 may be represented in the form of permutation diagrams where each line carries zero or one beads : @xmath271 ( i.e.  there are @xmath272 such diagrams ) .",
    "the rule of composition is then as for ordinary permutations except that the number of beads on a single line is reduced modulo 2 .",
    "such a diagram @xmath36 in which some line is replaced by a ( beadless ) red ( resp .",
    "blue ) line is to be understood as the linear combination @xmath273 where @xmath274 denote the diagram with that line having zero / one beads respectively . replacing all lines in this way , in all possible ways",
    ", we have another basis of @xmath266 consisting of all possible two - colourings of permutations . the composition rule here ( in consequence of )",
    "is to compose permutations by juxtaposition as usual , except that if two different coloured lines are juxtaposed the composite is zero .",
    "consider the subset of this basis consisting of elements in which two lines may cross only if their colour is distinct .",
    "this is a basis for a subalgebra ( to see this again consider the different coloured lines as living in two different layers  within a layer there are no crossings , and this is not affected by composition )",
    ". indeed it will be evident that this subalgebra may be _ identified _ with @xmath263 .",
    "now define two linear combinations in @xmath275 , each of shape @xmath276 but one with all lines coloured red , one with all lines coloured blue .",
    "note that these are ( unnormalised ) idempotents .",
    "define algebra @xmath277 to be the quotient of @xmath278 ( any @xmath279 ) by both these objects .",
    "it is well known that the irreducible representations of @xmath278 over @xmath280 are indexed by pairs of integer partitions of combined degree @xmath7 , and that the idempotents above are the primitive and central idempotents of @xmath281 corresponding to the one - dimensional irreducible representations indexed by @xmath282 and @xmath283 .",
    "it follows ( after a little work , see @xcite ) that the index set for irreducibles of the quotient @xmath277 is the subset of the set of pairs of integer partitions in which no partition has a second row .",
    "it follows similarly that the bratteli diagram for the tower of these algebras as @xmath7 varies is the pascal triangle , i.e.the simples for given @xmath7 lie in the @xmath284 layer of the pascal triangle .",
    "note that @xmath254 may be regarded as a basis for @xmath277 , since in @xmath277 any two lines of the same colour which are crossed may be replaced by the same two lines uncrossed ( i.e.  a local implementation of the quotient by the diagram above in that colour ) .",
    "now consider the sequence of algebra morphisms @xmath285 the image of a basis element in @xmath254 under the composite map is the same element regarded as a basis element of @xmath277 .",
    "thus the composite is an isomorphism .",
    "we have established a sequence of isomorphisms which allows us to identify the index set for simple modules of @xmath277 with @xmath256 .",
    "this reproduces the layer of the pascal triangle in our original foreshortened bratteli diagram and , taken layer by layer , using equation reproduces the whole foreshortened bratteli diagram .",
    "the @xmath286-sequence of a diagram is the sequence of colours of strings , read off clockwise from the top left hand corner of the frame .",
    "the standard basis @xmath287 may be partitioned into subsets of elements with the same @xmath286-sequence , called @xmath286-parts . since colours are orthogonal , the inner product is zero on any pair from @xmath287 unless they lie in the same @xmath286-part .",
    "thus the determinant of the gram matrix is a product of corresponding block determinants",
    ".    it will be evident that the block _ determinant _ depends only on the number of @xmath113 s and @xmath4 s , not their order in sequence .",
    "it is thus straightforward to determine the roots of the gram determinants ( which , we recall , are polynomials in @xmath288 ) , as follows .    for @xmath140 with @xmath180",
    "we have @xmath289 .",
    "( recall that a module is simple unless its gram matrix is singular , thus all these modules are simple . ) for @xmath140 with @xmath290 all the lines but one are propagating , so _ all _ lines of one colour ( red or blue ) are propagating .",
    "for example , the @xmath291 part of @xmath292 has gram block @xmath293 we see that the colour with all lines propagating plays no role , and that the gram block coincides , in this example , with the @xmath294 gram matrix of ordinary @xmath295 .",
    "thus the set of roots of _ any _ such gram determinant must be taken from the roots of the gram  determinants of @xmath296 and @xmath297 .",
    "these are well known @xcite to lie in the set of roots of unity ( when expressed in terms of @xmath29 ) for each colour .",
    "that is ,    [ ex1 ] if neither @xmath94 nor @xmath95 is a root of 1 then every module @xmath173 with @xmath290 is simple .",
    "[ ex3 ] if either @xmath94 or @xmath95 is a root of 1 then there is an @xmath7 such that @xmath54 is not semisimple .",
    "now suppose that for some choice of @xmath12 some standard module , @xmath298 say , is not simple ( as already noted , this has to happen for the algebra to fail to be semisimple ) .",
    "then in particular this module has some simple module , @xmath299 say , in its socle .",
    "take @xmath7 to be at its lowest value such that this occurs .",
    "it is easy to see that both the localisation functor @xmath300 and the globalisation functor @xmath301 take a standard module to a standard module with the same label ( or 0 if no such module exists , in case of @xmath300 ) .",
    "it is also easy to see that every simple module occurs as the head of some standard module .",
    "thus the nonsimplicity of our standard @xmath298 must show up as a morphism of standard modules between that having the simple @xmath302 as its head ( we might as well call it @xmath303 ) , and @xmath298 . if neither @xmath304 nor @xmath227 has @xmath180 then we can localise until one of them does , whereupon the corresponding standard is simple by our earlier analysis , thus this simple standard must be @xmath303 , and @xmath298 must have @xmath305 , that is to say , @xmath306 . but now suppose this @xmath307 ( and there is not a suitable choice of @xmath304 with @xmath308 ) .",
    "consider the following _ frobenius reciprocity _ :",
    "@xmath309 it is straightforward to show that @xmath303 appears in the head of the induced module @xmath310 . thus the left hand hom space is not empty .",
    "but then neither is the right , and we have a nontrivial homomorphism of distinct standard modules at level @xmath62 also .",
    "this is a _ contradiction _ of our construction that @xmath7 is the lowest value for which such a homomorphism occurs .",
    "thus we _ may not _ suppose that @xmath307 , i.e. , we must take @xmath311 .",
    "in other words , the first occurrence of such a morphism must be into a standard module with this type of label .",
    "but by proposition  [ ex1 ] such a morphism is only possible if at least one of @xmath29 is a root of unity .",
    "we have established    if neither @xmath94 nor @xmath95 is a root of 1 , then every module @xmath173 is simple , and @xmath54 is semisimple .",
    "the determination of the complete structure of @xmath54 when the parameters are roots of unity remains for now an open problem .",
    "it should be amenable to the methods we have developed , but it seems possible that considerably more donkey work remains . given the connection between the ordinary case and conformal representation theory ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) the answer should raise some interesting issues .",
    "we have constructed the generic irreducible modules of @xmath54 . every other module ( such as occurs in transfer matrices ) can be built as a sum of these .",
    "thus the spectrum of any transfer matrix will be ( up to multiplicities ) the union of the spectra computed using these smallest possible modules .",
    "this analysis thus provides the most efficient tools for explicit computation ( modulo any overarching constraints imposed in practice by , for example , implementation of the bethe ansatz ) , cf .",
    "note that it also tells us a convenient labelling scheme for types of correlation functions .",
    "the pair label @xmath207 here replaces the charge sector label relevant for bethe ansatz in ordinary spin - chains @xcite .",
    "that is , we have two naive pseudoparticle types .    in case",
    "the second colour is merely to be regarded as a dilution ( i.e.  it just acts as a placeholder ) , direct contributions to correlations involving this colour would be trivial or ignored . in more general settings we have the possibility of correlations in which distinct operators cross over in the plane ( a feature which can not occur in models built from the ordinary temperley - lieb algebra , such as ordinary potts models and ising models )",
    "this ` thickening ' of the underlying plane lattice provides scope for considering a number of further generalisations to more exotic 2d models and possibly also to 3d .",
    "we will return to these possibilities in a subsequent paper .",
    "certainly @xmath54 has a number of relatively obvious generalisations ( @xmath32 , @xmath312 , and certain generalisations to more exotic underlying spaces ) for which the corresponding generalised analysis goes through directly .",
    "work is in progress to find generalisations of grimm and pearce s original idea accordingly .",
    "it is interesting that the exceptional structure of @xmath54 is tied to the same special parameter choices as are already widely familiar for 2d systems  @xmath0 a root of unity  even though our models have multiple parameters .",
    "this contrasts sharply with direct attempts to generalise to 3d , such as the partition algebra , for which a completely different set of exceptional cases occur @xcite .",
    "finally we note two points of interest in representation theory .",
    "the new algebras have features reminiscent of a recent conjecture ( see @xcite , cf .",
    "our section  [ funky ] ) for a basis of generalised blob algebras .",
    "these algebras have been used recently to probe the physically relevant part of the representation theory of affine hecke algebras @xcite , so the connection here is intriguing .",
    "secondly , we observe that there is no known diagram calculus for the hecke algebra quotient associated to @xmath313 ( in the sense that the temperley - lieb algebra is a hecke algebra quotient associated to @xmath314 ) .",
    "indeed there is no calculus for @xmath315 for any @xmath316 but 2 .",
    "such a calculus has long been sought , and would be enormously useful in a number of areas of representation theory . as a generalisation of the @xmath317 case , our calculus provides some intriguing clues for @xmath318 ( although it is _ not _ itself an @xmath318 calculus ) .",
