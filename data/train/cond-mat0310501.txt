    "the shape of the fermi surface determines the kinetic and equilibrium properties of the electron gas in the crystal matter @xcite as well as the dynamics of a single electron in crystal @xcite .",
    "the shape of this surface can be reconstructed drastically by a high magnetic field @xcite . however , a uniform magnetic field changes totally the translation properties of an electron in the crystal lattice : the appearance of a new length scale ( the magnetic length ) leads to the famous phenomena related to the `` commensurability  incommensurability '' transitions . in particular , a fractal structure arises in the diagram describing the dependence of the two - dimansional electron spectrum on the magnetic flux ( azbelhofstadter butterfly @xcite )",
    "it was shown recently that this fractal structure is an inherent characteristic not only of two - dimensional spectral diagrams but also of the `` flux  energy '' and `` angle  energy '' diagrams for a three - dimensional magneto - bloch electron @xcite .",
    "the translation symmetry of the bloch electron in a uniform magnetic field is defined by the magnetic translation group @xcite , which has more complicated structure in comparison with the translation group without the field . in particular ,",
    "the ordinary quasi - momentum is no longer a conserved quantity , therefore , at high magnetic fields a modification of the definition of the fermi surface is required .",
    "such a modification is given by v.  ya .",
    "demikhovskii with coworkers @xcite . in papers",
    "@xcite , the construction and investigation of the fermi surfaces in the magnetic brillouin zone have been performed by means of the tight - binding approximation .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the change of the topology of the fermi surface under the influence of the magnetic field can cause the metal  semiconductor transition .",
    "the procedure of obtaining the tight - binding schrdinger operator ( also called the harper operator ) leads to a rather rough approximation of the initial hamiltonian ; for example , in the 2d case it is known that the `` flux  energy '' diagram for the original periodic landau operator differs essentially from the classical hofstadter butterfly @xcite .    in this connection , it is interesting to build and investigate the fermi surfaces in the magnetic brillouin zone for the periodic landau operator without additional approximations .",
    "here we consider the case of the landau operator perturbed by a lattice @xmath0 of short - range scatterers . to get an explicitly solvable model we deal here with a limiting case of the short - range potential , namely , with the zero - range potential @xcite , also called `` point potential '' .",
    "we stress , that the method of zero - range perturbations for obtaining the fermi surfaces in 3d crystals without magnetic fields was successfully used earlier @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the spectral properties of the three - dimensional landau operator perturbed by a periodic point potential was studied in papers @xcite . in particular , in the paper @xcite ,",
    "a version of the magneto - bloch analysis was proposed which makes it possible to get an explicit form of the dispersion relation for the problem we consider here .",
    "we start with the quantum - mechanical hamiltonian @xmath1 of a single electron subject to a uniform magnetic field @xmath2 @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the charge and mass of the electron , respectively , and @xmath6 is the vector potential of the field @xmath7 .",
    "we choose the symmetric gauge : @xmath8 ; in this case the form of @xmath1 in any cartesian coordinate system with the @xmath9-axis directed along the field @xmath7 is independent of the choice of the other coordinate axes .",
    "we use the standard notations @xmath10 ( the cyclotron frequency ) , @xmath11 ( the magnetic length ) , and @xmath12 ( the magnetic flux quantum ) . throughout the paper",
    "we denote by @xmath13 , @xmath14 , the vector of the magnetic flux density : if @xmath15 and @xmath16 are nonzero vectors , then @xmath17 is the total number of the magnetic flux quanta through the parallelogram spanned by @xmath15 and @xmath18 .",
    "note that @xmath19 .",
    "all important physical information concerning the hamiltonian @xmath1 is contained in the green function @xmath20 at energy @xmath21 defined as @xmath22 .",
    "it is known ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) that this function can be represented in the following forms : @xmath23 where @xmath24\\,,\\ ] ] @xmath25 } { \\sqrt{l+1/2-e/\\hbar\\omega}}\\,l_l({\\bf r}_\\bot^2/2l_m^2)\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath26 } { \\left(1-e^{-t}\\right)\\exp\\left[(1/2-e/\\hbar\\omega)t\\right ] } \\frac{dt}{\\sqrt{\\pi t}}\\,.\\ ] ] here @xmath27 is the projection of @xmath28 on the direction of the field @xmath29 and @xmath30 ; the function @xmath31 is the @xmath32-th laguerre polynomial .",
    "it is convenient to decompose @xmath20 into a sum of singular and regular ( with respect to the limit @xmath33 ) parts : @xmath34 } { |{\\bf r}-{\\bf r}'|}+ g_0^{\\rm reg}({\\bf r},{\\bf r}';e)\\,.\\ ] ] note that @xmath35 is well defined at @xmath36 and @xmath37 were @xmath38 is the generalized riemann zeta - function ( in other words , the hurwitz zeta - function ) @xcite .",
    "now we consider a crystalline lattice @xmath39 with nodes @xmath40 ; the bravais lattice of the crystal we denote by @xmath0 .",
    "choose a basis @xmath15 , @xmath18 , @xmath41 of @xmath0 , then a basic cell @xmath42 of @xmath39 ( the wigner  seitz cell ) is fixed : @xmath43 .",
    "if @xmath44 is the set of nodes of @xmath39 containing in @xmath42 , then @xmath45 ; this means that each vector @xmath46 can be represented in the form @xmath47 , where @xmath48 , @xmath49 ( note that such a representation is unique ) . without loss of generality",
    "we will suppose that @xmath50 .",
    "we choose the potential @xmath51 of the crystalline lattice @xmath39 in the form @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the confinement potential near the node @xmath54 . to obtain an explicitly solvable model ,",
    "we pass to the zero - range limit for @xmath55 .",
    "this means that we consider @xmath55 as the limit of potentials of the form @xmath56 , where @xmath57 outside a small sphere of radius @xmath58 centered at zero , the coupling constant @xmath59 is of order @xmath58 , and @xmath60 . at the limit @xmath61 the potential @xmath55",
    "is characterized by one parameter only , namely , by the scattering length @xmath62 , which is related to the binding energy of the ground state for @xmath55 by @xmath63 ( see ref .",
    "what is important , at the zero - range limit the green function @xmath64 of @xmath65 has the following explicit expression in terms of the green function @xmath66 of @xmath1 ( see ref .",

    "penney hamiltonian .",
    "the spectral properties of @xmath65 can be extracted from the properties of invertibility of the infinite matrix @xmath69 .",
    "namely , at least for @xmath72 the energy @xmath21 belongs to the spectrum of @xmath65 if the matrix @xmath69 is not invertible . under so - called `` rationality condition '' @xcite",
    ", we can reduce the problem to invert the infinite matrix @xmath69 to a problem of finite - dimensional algebra . according to @xcite , we call the field @xmath7 _ rational _ with respect to @xmath0 if for some basis @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath41 of @xmath0 , all the numbers @xmath73 are rational .",
    "it is clear that every @xmath7 obeys this condition after an appropriate infinitely small change of direction , therefore , the rationality condition imposes no essential restrictions on @xmath74 .",
    "if @xmath7 is rational with respect to @xmath0 , then a basis @xmath75 of @xmath0 can be chosen in such a way that @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "denote @xmath78 , where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are coprime positive integers ; in our approach the crucial role is played by the following @xmath81 matrix @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the number of nodes in @xmath44 : @xmath84\\times\\\\\\ ] ] @xmath85 @xmath86\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath87 denotes the pair @xmath88 with @xmath48 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 is the magnetic quasimomentum .",
    "the magnetic brillouin zone is defined by the inequalities @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and , in this zone , the dispersion relation for @xmath65 reads @xmath94 for a fixed @xmath95 , equation ( [ kp ] ) has infinitely many solutions @xmath96 , @xmath97 ; each @xmath96 is an @xmath80-fold degenerate eigenvalue of @xmath65 .",
    "dispersion laws @xmath98 are continuous functions of @xmath95 ; the set of all values of @xmath96 is an interval @xmath99 . in a natural way , the intervals @xmath99 form clusters called _ magnetic bands _ or _ landau bands _ ,",
    "each magnetic band contain @xmath100 adjacent intervals @xmath99 ( _ subbands _ ) . for the fermi energy @xmath101 , the equation @xmath102 determines a periodic surface in the quasimomentum space ( the _ fermi surface _ ) .",
    "using eqs .  ( [ kpr ] )  ( [ fe ] ) we analyze numerically the shape of the fermi surfaces in a crystal with the simple - cubic lattice for various directions of the field @xmath29 . the lattice constant @xmath103  nm is chosen relevant to the geometric parameters for the 3d regimented quantum dot superlattice considered recently in ref .  @xcite . as to the scattering length",
    ", we put @xmath104  nm , this corresponds to the binding energy @xmath105  mev .",
    "let the magnetic field @xmath7 is directed along the edge @xmath41 of the cubic elementary cell and @xmath106 ; this value of @xmath107 corresponds to the field strength @xmath108  t ( note in this connection that it was reported on the possibility to achieve the magnetic field strength 28 mg @xcite ) . in the considered case , the lowest magnetic band of the spectrum has the form @xmath109 $ ] , where @xmath110 .",
    "the fermi surfaces for various energy values from this band are depicted in fig .  1",
    ". the warped ellipsoids in the panels ( a ) and ( d ) are the electron and hole surfaces respectively ; in this case _ there exist only closed trajectories of the charged particle in the @xmath111-space .",
    "_ other topologies of the fermi surface are shown in panels ( b ) and ( c ) ; according to the definition from @xcite these surfaces have the topology of range 2 and 3 respectively .",
    "surprisingly , an inclination of @xmath7 to the edge of the cubic cell causes a profound reconstruction of the fermi surfaces . as an example we consider @xmath112 . in the new basis @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115",
    ", we have @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "therefore , the magnetic brilluoin zone is defined by the inequalities @xmath118 , @xmath119 , and the lowest magnetic band splits into 5 subbands .",
    "2 shows variation of the fermi surface as the fermi energy @xmath101 varies in the first subband @xmath120 $ ] .",
    "the electron and hole fermi surfaces have the shapes of warped cylinders ( panels ( a ) and ( d ) respectively ) or highly twisted sheets ( panels ( b ) and ( c ) ) .",
    "it is particularly remarkable that in this case the surfaces _ are open in the @xmath121-direction_. in going from the first subband of the lowest magnetic band to the higher subbands , the shape of the fermi surface changes ; examples of this change are shown on fig .  3 , where the fermi energy @xmath101 lies in the second and fourth subbands respectively .    in the examples",
    "above , the filed @xmath7 is parallel to a face of the cubic cell .",
    "we have built the fermi surface for the field of the form @xmath122 , where @xmath123 but by the technical reasons do not give the corresponding figure here . in this case , the fermi surface is divided into great numbers of connected pieces having the shape of winding sheets .",
    "such a complex structure of the fermi surface reflects the fractal structure of the spectrum of the periodic landau operator @xcite .",
