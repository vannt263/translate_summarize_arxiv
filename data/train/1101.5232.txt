    "large - scale propagating disturbances in the solar corona have been subject of extensive studies for more than twelve years . for the first time , these events were observed by the extreme - ultraviolet imaging telescope ( eit ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) onboard the solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and are thus commonly called ` eit - waves ' .",
    "they appear as diffuse coronal brightenings , forming circular wave fronts , traveling hundreds of mm without hindrance under quiet - sun conditions .    at present",
    "there are two competing groups of models based on completely different ideas of the physical nature of eit , or more generally , euv waves .",
    "the first theory describes them as nonlinear fast - mode magnetosonic waves following the original interpretation of large - scale disturbances by uchida ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "several characteristics of coronal waves can be explained by this theory : ( 1 ) the propagation perpendicular to magnetic field lines ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , ( 2 ) the pulse broadening and amplitude drop off @xcite , ( 3 ) the reflection and refraction at regions of high alfvn velocity @xcite .",
    "the second group of models , however , consider these coronal bright fronts as no waves at all , but as the signature of a large - scale magnetic reconfiguration of field lines during a cme lift - off ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . in these pseudo - waves models ,",
    "coronal waves could exclusively occur in conjunction with cmes .",
    "this assumption is supported by statistical studies , showing a close relation between waves and cmes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these models can also explain stationary brightenings @xcite and the occasionally observed rotation of coronal bright fronts @xcite . for recent reviews we refer to @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the limitations of eit observations , especially the low imaging cadence of @xmath41215 minutes , were a major contributor to the difficulties determining the physical nature of coronal waves .",
    "the extreme ultraviolet imager ( euvi ; * ? ? ? * ) instruments , which are part of the sun earth connection coronal and heliospheric investigation ( secchi ; * ? ? ? * ) suite onboard the twin solar - terrestrial relations observatory ( stereo ; * ? ? ? * ) spacecraft overcome these limitations .",
    "euvi observes the entire solar disk as well as the corona up to 1.7 r@xmath5 in four spectral channels ( he ii 304 : t @xmath4 0.07 mk ; fe ix 171 : t @xmath4 1 mk ; fe xii 195 : t @xmath4 1.5 mk ; fe xv 284 : t @xmath4 2.25 mk ) . the high imaging cadence down to @xmath6 seconds , the large fov as well as the ability of simultaneous observations from two vantage points , provide us with new insights * into * the three - dimensional kinematics and dynamics of euv waves ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "in this letter we present the first case of homologous eit waves ever reported in the nearly 14 years of continuous studies of large - scale coronal waves .",
    "the four homologous waves , observed by stereo - b within a period of eight hours , were launched from the same ar , propagated in the same direction , and their wave fronts were similar in both shape and angular extent .",
    "these events allow us to perform a detailed study of the physical characteristics of large - scale coronal waves , as these homologous waves are initiated and propagate under similar coronal background conditions .",
    "hence , our analysis of the correlation between the wave pulse parameters is not influenced by the limiting factor of differing coronal plasma conditions , persistent in previous comparative studies of eit waves .",
    "the events under study occurred on 2010 april 2829 , and were observed by stereo - b ( henceforth st - b ) , positioned 70.5  behind earth on its orbit around the sun . for our analysis , only the high - cadence euvi imagery in 195  ( cadence of 5 minutes ) was suitable , since the 171  and 284  filtergrams were recorded only every 2 hours , and the 304  data revealed no wave signatures at all .",
    "in addition , the white - light coronagraph ( wlc ) images of the cor1-b and cor2-b instruments @xcite and of the large angle and spectrometric coronagraph ( lasco ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) c2 instrument onboard soho were used to identify signatures of associated cmes .",
    "the euvi 195  filtergrams were reduced using the secchi_prep routines available within solarsoft .",
    "additionally we differentially rotated the images to the same reference time . in order to enhance faint coronal wave signatures , we derived running ratio ( rr ) images dividing each direct image by a frame taken 10  minutes earlier .",
    "the four euv waves under study were launched on 2010 april 2829 within a period of 8 hours ( see  fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "movie 1 shows st - b 195  direct and running ratio full disk images covering the full observation period .",
    "figure 1 consists of snapshots from the movie illustrating the evolution of all four waves . in each column",
    "we present two fronts of each event , with the upper panels showing the wave front with the maximum intensity amplitude , and the lower panels showing the propagating wave front 20 minutes later .",
    "all four coronal disturbances are launched from the same ar noaa 11067 , propagate in the same direction and have a similar appearance and angular extent , thus it is appropriate to call them homologous .",
    "the time interval between the onsets of the successive waves steadily increased : @xmath41.75 hr ( wave 12 ) , @xmath42.5 hr ( wave 23 ) and @xmath43.5 hr ( wave 34 ) . in order to obtain better insight into the onset of the coronal waves",
    ", we studied a small area [ fov : @xmath7 centered on the source ar .",
    "figure  [ fig2](f , g ) gives one snapshot of this region during the launch of wave 4 , the strongest one of the four events . during the full observation period we recorded persisting dynamical processes in the extended loop system of noaa 11067 ( see movie 2 available as online supplement ) .",
    "the resemblance of the events suggests that the background coronal field has not changed noticeably within these eight hours .",
    "moreover , this implies that the corona is disturbed by the eit waves only for a short period of time and returns to its pre - event condition on a timescale of tens of minutes . in at least two cases , waves 3 and 4",
    ", there is evidence that the main perturbation was followed by an additional weak disturbance about 20 minutes later ( see movie 1 ) .",
    "we analyzed the kinematics of the waves , each treated as unique event , employing two different methods .",
    "firstly , we visually determined the wave fronts in a series of rr images . secondly , we examined the perturbation amplitudes of the wave . in both methods we focused on a 60  sector on the solar surface , where all four waves were distinctly observable ( see  fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] panel 7 ; yellow curves ) .    in the first method",
    "the wave fronts were tracked manually , and their center was obtained from a circular fit to the earliest wave fronts carried out in spherical coordinates ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the mean distance of each wave front from the thus determined center is calculated along the solar surface . in the second method we subdivided the solar surface into spherical segments of equal width concentric around the wave center obtained by method one .",
    "plotting the average intensities versus mean distances of all segments gives one intensity profile per rr image ( cf .",
    "* ) . in these perturbation profiles , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( top panels ) , the wave front presents itself as distinct bump above the background intensity . in each case",
    ", the perturbation amplitude reaches its maximum @xmath45 minutes after the onset of the wave ( see fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "as example , the evolution of the perturbation amplitude of wave 4 is plotted in fig .  [ fig3 ] ( bottom panel ) . from the wave perturbation profiles we extracted the foremost position of the wave front , defined as the point at which the gaussian fit to the profile falls below the value of @xmath8 ( blue dotted line in top panel of fig .  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "we note that the visually tracked distances match well the position of the wave front obtained from the perturbation profiles ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( top panel ) we show the kinematics for wave 4 derived with both methods together with error bars .",
    "linear as well as quadratic least squares fits were applied to the time - distance data , both yielding similar velocities of @xmath9 .",
    "the parabolic fit suggests a small deceleration of @xmath10 . in order to distinguish whether the linear or parabolic fit better represents the data",
    ", we derived the 95% confidence interval for the linear fit .",
    "the quadratic fit lies within the error bars and the confidence interval , thus it is reasonable to represent the wave s kinematics by the linear fit with a constant velocity of @xmath1 over the full propagation distance up to @xmath11 .",
    "we found similar results for the other three wave events under study , which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( bottom panels ) .",
    "the velocities @xmath12 of the four homologous waves are : @xmath13 ( wave 1 ) , @xmath14 ( wave 2 ) , @xmath15 ( wave 3 ) and @xmath16 ( wave 4 ) .",
    "all peak perturbation profiles together with a gaussian fit are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( top panel ) .",
    "the perturbation profiles of all four waves are steepening and show an increase in amplitude in the early phase of their evolution until the peak perturbation amplitude @xmath17 is reached .",
    "the values @xmath17 of all four waves are : @xmath18 ( wave 1 ) , @xmath19 ( wave 2 ) , @xmath20 ( wave 3 ) and @xmath21 ( wave 4 ) .",
    "the bright fronts of coronal euv waves are in general caused by a local temperature and density enhancement ( plasma compression ) .",
    "assuming that the change in density is more important than that in temperature , one can derive an estimate of the density jump from the intensity amplitude @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "this implies for the peak amplitudes of the four homologous waves a maximum density jump of @xmath24 = @xmath25 ( wave 1 ) , @xmath26 ( wave 2 ) , @xmath25 ( wave 3 ) , and @xmath27 ( wave 4 ) .",
    "the analysis of euvi , cor1 and cor2 images , covering both days of april 2829 , revealed no clear evidence of associated cmes .",
    "however , lasco c2 recorded four faint cmes , each entering the c2 fov about 45 minutes after the first observation of a wave front by euvi ( cf .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a)-(d ) and movie 3 ) . in the lasco cme catalog",
    "just cmes 2  4 are listed and classified as poor , only visible in c2 at position angles @xmath485@xmath28 .",
    "cmes 3 and 4 reveal additional bright features following the actual cme leading edge with at least the same speed .",
    "these features resemble rather small scale ejecta than prominences trailing the leading edge and could be related to the above mentioned weak disturbances following wave 3 and 4 ( see movie 1 ) .",
    "as the center of the source ar lies @xmath415@xmath28 behind the limb , as seen from soho , we experience low projection effects in the derived cme plane - of - sky velocities , which lie in the range of @xmath29 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( e ) ) . setting the onset site to the solar limb and onset time to the moment",
    ", euvi observed the first front of the associated wave , we estimated for each of cmes 24 an average initial velocity in the range of @xmath30 .",
    "we can speculate , that the kinematics shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( e ) supports the idea of a strong deceleration of the faint , i.e. low - density , cmes during their early evolution .    in each of the four wave events ,",
    "an increase in intensity in the central region of the source loop system ( see  fig .",
    "[ fig2](g ) ) , constituting weak flares , is observed @xmath31 minutes before the first recorded wave front .",
    "since the wave events occurred behind the solar limb , as viewed from earth , no goes x - ray data are available to obtain the flare class . as the determined wave kinematics allows us to back -",
    "extrapolate the start of the wave ( see  fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ; bottom panel ) , we can compare the timing of the flare commencement and the wave onsets ( see also movie 2 ) .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( middle panel ) shows the evolution of the total intensity of the central region in the ar .",
    "four distinct intensity peaks are discernible , which coincide with the first observations of the four coronal waves . during these flaring phases",
    "we observe the disappearance of several loops in the 195  rr - images ( see  fig .  [ fig2](f ) ) , whose northern branch is rooted close to the flaring part of the ar .",
    "the coronal waves are , however , launched from the opposite side and the shape of each first wave front exactly maps out the geometry of the southern loop system .",
    "never before in the nearly 14 years of continuous research of large - scale coronal waves homologous eit wave events were reported .",
    "we are the first to present a study of homologous eit waves , emerging from the same ar within a short period of time .",
    "they travel into the same direction and their fronts have similar shape and angular extent .",
    "they propagate into a quiet sun area , surrounded by ars to the north and south and a large coronal hole close to the northern polar region ( see  movie 1 ) .",
    "as is expected for nonlinear magnetosonic waves , they do not penetrate into these regions of increased alfvn velocity ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in our study",
    "we compared for the first time different methods of deriving the wave kinematics , the ( rather subjective ) visual method and the ( more objective ) profile method .",
    "both methods yield consistent results , i.e. the waves propagate at constant velocities @xmath32 for the weakest wave up to @xmath33 for the strongest event .",
    "furthermore , we calculated the perturbation profiles to study the physical characteristics and evolution of the disturbances .",
    "the strong initial steepening of the perturbation amplitudes confirms that these features are indeed shocks , albeit only weak shocks , since they peak at low intensity values @xmath34    assuming these coronal waves to constitute large - scale fast magnetosonic waves , the measured velocities lie well within the velocity range of @xmath35 for fast magnetosonic waves for quiet sun conditions . in",
    "the mhd approach the quantities defining a shock wave in the solar corona are : @xmath36  shock magnetosonic mach number , @xmath37  density jump at the shock front , @xmath38  angle between shock front and magnetic field , @xmath39  plasma - beta .",
    "they are related by the rankine - hugoniot ( rh ) conditions for an oblique shock ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "considering a perpendicular shock the rh relation reduces to @xmath40 with a polytropic index @xmath41 of @xmath42 .",
    "studies of @xcite indicate that @xmath43 in the quiet sun s low corona . using the previously calculated density jumps @xmath44 ( cf .",
    "[ wavekin ] , @xmath45 ) , we derive for the peak magnetosonic mach numbers @xmath36= @xmath46 ( wave 1 ) , @xmath47 ( wave 2 ) , @xmath26 ( wave 3 ) , and @xmath48 ( wave 4 ) .    with these observations of homologous waves , we can for the first time perform a quantitative analysis of the characteristic wave parameters without any limiting factors like changing or unknown quiet sun background conditions .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows the calculated magnetosonic mach number versus the propagation velocities @xmath12 of the four waves , revealing a distinct correlation between the wave characteristics @xmath36 and @xmath12 with a correlation coefficient of @xmath49 .",
    "such correlation is expected for nonlinear fast - mode magnetosonic waves because of the relation @xmath50 ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where @xmath12 is the coronal wave speed and @xmath51 the fast magnetosonic speed [ @xmath52 alfvn velocity , @xmath53  sound speed ] . the mean magnetosonic speed , derived by averaging the four ratios @xmath54 , yields @xmath55kms@xmath56 and gives with @xmath57kms@xmath56 ( t @xmath41.5  mk ) a mean alfvn velocity of @xmath58kms@xmath56",
    "applying one to five  fold saito coronal density models for a propagation height of @xmath59 , we derive for the low corona during solar minimum conditions a magnetic field strength between @xmath60gauss .",
    "the magnetosonic mach numbers of all four waves peak at values less than 1.10 and drop off towards the linear regime ( @xmath61 ) as the waves expand .",
    "these small magnetosonic mach numbers together with the correlated wave velocities support the view that each observed coronal wave is a low - amplitude mhd fast - mode wave .",
    "since @xmath36 is even at the maximum close to the linear regime , this also implies that the fast - mode mhd waves are expected to experience only minor deceleration .",
    "since @xmath12 decreases proportional to @xmath36 , this implies a @xmath62 change in velocity for the waves under study .",
    "for the strongest wave 4 this corresponds to a value of @xmath63  km  s@xmath56 . as the error in velocity is of the same order of @xmath64 ( @xmath65  km  s@xmath56 for wave 4 ) ,",
    "such weak deceleration is hidden in the measurement uncertainties .",
    "finally , we note a clear correlation between the lags between successive waves , interpreted as the build - up times of the magnetic energy for the following wave event , and the intensity @xmath66 , density @xmath67 , magnetosonic mach number @xmath36 , and the propagation velocities @xmath12 of waves 2 to 4 ( cf .",
    "[ fig5 ] , bottom ) .    in our study of the homologous wave events it was possible to compare the wave pulse characteristics and analyze correlations between the wave parameters , knowing that the four large - scale waves propagate in similar coronal conditions .",
    "this means that any found correlation is independent from the indeterminated but constant coronal conditions .",
    "our results provide strong support that the observed large - scale coronal waves are indeed fast - mode magnetosonic waves , and additionally suggest a dependence of the wave parameters upon the build - up time of the magnetic energy .    i.w.k .",
