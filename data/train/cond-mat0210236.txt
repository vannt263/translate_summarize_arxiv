    "for although high - temperature superconductivity has not been yet targeted as ` _ the shame and despair of theoretical physics _ ' , - a label attributed to superconductivity during the first half - century after its discovery - the parlous state of current theoretical constructions has led to a current consensus that there is no consensus on the theory of high-@xmath1 superconductivity@xcite .",
    "our view is that the extension of the bcs theory towards the strong interaction between electrons and ion vibrations describes naturally the phenomenon , and the high temperature superconductivity exists in the crossover region of the electron - lattice interaction strength from the bcs - like to bipolaronic superconductivity @xcite .",
    "quite remarkably bednorz and mller noted in their original publication @xcite and subsequently in their nobel price lecture @xcite , that in their ground - breaking search for high - t@xmath2 superconductivity , they were stimulated and guided by the polaron model .",
    "their expectation @xcite was that if ` _ an electron and a surrounding lattice distortion with a high effective mass can travel through the lattice as a whole , and a strong electron - lattice coupling exists an insulator could be turned into a high temperature superconductor _ ' .",
    "indeed there is now overwhelming experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite evidence for an exceptionally strong electron - phonon ( e - ph ) interaction in high temperature superconductors .",
    "thus the theory of htsc must include both e - ph and electron - electron coulomb interactions as it was suggested some time ago@xcite .",
    "also one has to take into account that all oxides are highly polarizable ionic lattices .",
    "a low density of mobile carriers is unable to screen effectively the direct coulomb electron - ion and electron - electron interactions .",
    "the layered structure of the cuprates reduces screening even further .",
    "since the mobile carriers are confined to the copper - oxygen planes their interaction with c - axis polarized optical phonons can not be screened , and it is particularly strong .",
    "the parameter - free estimate of the polaron binding energy , @xmath3 due to the long - range frhlich e - ph interaction puts it at about 0.5 ev or larger in the cuprates @xcite .",
    "however bipolaronic states are much heavier than band electrons since they are ` dressed ' by the same lattice deformation , which bounds two polarons in a pair @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the superconducting critical temperature , @xmath1 , being proportional to the inverse mass of a bipolaron , might be significantly reduced rather than enhanced compared with the weak - coupling bcs @xmath4 because of this prejudice some objections have been raised with respect to the bipolaron theory of high - temperature superconductivity .  in the present article we review a few recent models of small bipolarons with the long - range electron - phonon ( e - ph ) interaction capturing the essential physics of superconducting cuprates @xcite .",
    "these studies prove that small bipolarons are perfectly mobile bloch states in the cuprates which can explain their high @xmath1 .",
    "the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath5 is about the ratio of the electron - phonon interaction energy @xmath3 to the half bandwidth @xmath6 in a rigid lattice .",
    "we expect that when the coupling is strong , @xmath7 , all electrons in the bloch band are `` dressed '' by phonons because their kinetic energy ( @xmath8 ) is small compared with the potential energy due to a local lattice deformation caused by an electron",
    ". if phonon frequencies are very low , the local lattice deformation traps the electron .",
    "this _ self - trapping _",
    "phenomenon was predicted by landau @xcite .",
    "it has been studied in greater detail by pekar and frhlich , and later on the most advanced path - integral theory of polarons was developed by feynman and devreese and his school in the effective mass approximation , which leads to the so - called _ large polaron _",
    "( for more detail see ref .",
    "the large polaron propagates through the lattice like a free electron but with the enhanced effective mass . in the strong - coupling regime , @xmath9 the finite bandwidth becomes important , so that the effective mass approximation can not be applied .",
    "the electron is called a _ small polaron _ in this regime .",
    "the self - trapping is never `` complete '' , that is any polaron can tunnel through the lattice coherently . only in the extreme _ adiabatic _",
    "limit , when the phonon frequencies tend to zero , the self - trapping is complete , and the polaron motion is no longer translationally continuous .",
    "the main features of the small polaron were understood by tjablikov @xcite , yamashita and kurosava @xcite , sewell @xcite , holstein and his school @xcite , lang and firsov @xcite , and others and described in several review papers and textbooks @xcite .",
    "the exponential reduction of the bandwidth at large values of @xmath5 is one of those features .",
    "the small polaron bandwidth decreases with increasing temperature up to a crossover region from the coherent small polaron tunneling to a thermally activated hopping .",
    "the crossover from the polaron bloch states to the incoherent hopping takes place at temperatures @xmath10 or higher , where @xmath11 is the characteristic phonon frequency .",
    "here we show that _ small  bipolarons _ are also in the itinerant bloch states in a wide temperature region .",
    "moreover , they propagate with about the same mass as a single polaron in particular lattices such as perovskites .",

( 13 ) , quadratic in @xmath45 , yields a negative @xmath53-_independent _ correction to the polaron level shift of the order of @xmath54 .",
    "the attractive energy of two small polarons , @xmath55 is generally larger than the polaron bandwidth in the strong - coupling regime , @xmath56 because the bandwidth narrowing factor @xmath57 is small @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the coulomb pseudopotential .",
    "when this condition is fulfilled , small bipolarons are not overlapped .",

    "the intersite polaron - polaron interaction eq.(8 ) is purely coulomb repulsion because the phonon mediated attraction between two polarons on different sites is zero in the holstein model .",

    "the frhlich interaction with optical phonons , which is unscreened in polaronic systems , is much stronger .",
    "this longer - range interaction leads to a lighter polaron in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "indeed , the polaron is heavy because it has to carry the lattice deformation with it , the same deformation that forms the polaron itself .",
    "therefore , there exists a generic relation between the polaron stabilization energy , @xmath3 , and the renormalization of its mass , @xmath146 where the numeric coefficient @xmath147 depends on the radius of the interaction . for a short - range e - ph interaction ,",
    "the _ entire _ lattice deformation disappears and then forms at another site , when the polaron moves between the nearest lattices sites .",
    "therefore , @xmath148 and polarons and on - site bipolarons are very heavy for the characteristic values of @xmath3 and @xmath149 . on the contrary , in case of a long - range interaction , only a fraction of the total deformation changes every time the polaron moves and @xmath147 could be as small as @xmath150 @xcite .",

    "the lower mass has important consequences , because lighter polarons are more likely to remain mobile and less likely to trap on impurities .",
    "the bipolaron also becomes much lighter , if the e - ph interaction is longer - range .",
    "there are two reasons for lowering of its mass with increasing radius of the e - ph interaction .",
    "the first one is the same as in the case of a single polaron discussed above .",
    "the second reason is the possibility to form _ intersite _ bipolarons , which , in certain lattice structures , tunnell coherently already in the first - order in @xmath14 @xcite , in contrast with onsite bipolarons , which tunnel only in the second - order , eq.(35 ) .    to illustrate the essential dynamic properties of bipolarons formed by the longer - range e - ph interaction",
    "let us discuss a few simplified models .",
    "following bona and trugman@xcite we first consider a single bipolaron in the chain model of ref.@xcite .",
    "one can further simplify the chain model by placing ions in the interstitial sites located between wannier orbitals of one chain , and allowing for the e - ph interaction only with the nearest neighbours of another chain , as shown in fig.1 .",
    "the coulomb interaction is represented by the on - site hubbard @xmath66 term .",

    "this model is referred as the _ extended _ holstein - hubbard model ( ehhm ) @xcite .",
    "we can view the ehhm as the simplest model with longer range than holstein interaction . in comparison to the frhlich interaction",
    "the ehhm lacks long - range tail in the e - ph interaction , but reveals the similar physical properties . in the momentum representation",
    "the model is a one - dimensional case of the generic hamiltonian , eq.(1 ) , with @xmath157 and @xmath158 using eqs.(10 ) , ( 14 ) and ( 8) we obtain @xmath159=2g_{0}^{2}\\omega _ { 0}\\ ] ] for the polaron level shift , @xmath160=g_{0}^{2}\\ ] ] for the mass enhancement exponent , and @xmath161\\cos qa=-2g_{0}^{2}\\omega _ { 0 }   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the onsite and intersite polaron - polaron interactions , respectively .",

    "the nearest neighbour interaction , eq.(51 ) is @xmath233 if two polarons are on the different sides of the ladder , and @xmath234 if both polarons are on the same side .",
    "the attractive interaction is provided via the displacement of the lattice sites , which are the common nearest neighbours to both polarons .",
    "there are two such nearest neighbours for the intersite bipolaron of the type @xmath235 or @xmath236 , fig.2c , but there is only one common nearest neighbour for the bipolaron @xmath237 , fig.2d .",
    "when @xmath238 , there are no bound states and the multi - polaron system is a one - dimensional luttinger liquid . however , when @xmath239 and consequently @xmath240 , the two polarons are bound into an intersite bipolaron of the type @xmath235 or @xmath236 .",
    "it is quite remarkable that the bipolaron tunnelling in the ladder appears already in the first order with respect to a single - electron tunnelling .",
    "this case is different from both onsite bipolarons and from the intersite chain bipolarons discussed above , where the bipolaron tunnelling was of the second order in @xmath45 .",
    "indeed , the lowest energy degenerate configurations @xmath241 and @xmath236 are degenerate . they are coupled by @xmath242 neglecting all higher - energy configurations , we can project the hamiltonian onto the subspace containing @xmath235 , @xmath236 , and empty sites .",
    "the result of such a projection is a bipolaronic hamiltonian @xmath243-t^{\\prime } \\sum_{n}[b_{n}^{\\dagger } a_{n}+b_{n-1}^{\\dagger } a_{n}+h.c.],\\ ] ] where @xmath244 and @xmath245 are intersite bipolaron annihilation operators , and the bipolaron - bipolaron interaction is dropped ( see below ) . its fourier transform yields two _ bipolaron _ bands , @xmath246 with a combined width @xmath247 .",
    "the bipolaron binding energy in zero order with respect to @xmath248 is @xmath249 the bipolaron mass near the bottom of the lowest band , @xmath250 , is @xmath251 .\\ ] ] the numerical coefficient @xmath252 ensures that @xmath253 remains of the order of @xmath254 even at large @xmath3 .",
    "this fact combines with a weaker renormalization of @xmath254 , eq.(57 ) , providing a _ superlight _ bipolaron .    in models with strong intersite attraction",
    "there is a possibility of clasterization .",
    "similar to the two - particle case above , the lowest energy of @xmath255 polarons placed on the nearest neighbours of the ladder is found as @xmath256 for any @xmath257 .",
    "there are _ no _ resonating states for @xmath255-polaron nearest neighbour configuration if @xmath257 . therefore there is no first - order kinetic energy contribution to their energy .",
    "@xmath258 should be compared with the energy @xmath259 of far separated @xmath260 bipolarons and a single polaron for odd @xmath257 , or with the energy of far separated @xmath255 bipolarons for even @xmath261 .",
    "`` odd '' clusters are stable if @xmath262 and `` even '' clusters are stable if @xmath263 as a result we find that bipolarons repel each other and single polarons at @xmath264",
    ". if @xmath184 is less than @xmath265 then immobile bound clusters of three and more polarons could form .",
    "one should notice that at distances much larger than the lattice constant the polaron - polaron interaction is always repulsive , and the formation of infinite clusters , stripes or strings is impossible @xcite . combining the condition of bipolaron formation and that of the instability of larger clusters we obtain a window of parameters @xmath266 where the ladder is a bipolaronic conductor . outside the window",
    "the ladder is either charge segregated into finite - size clusters ( small @xmath184 ) , or it is a liquid of repulsive polarons ( large @xmath184 ) .",
    "it was analytically establshed a long time ago @xcite that small polarons are itinerant quasiparticles existing in the bloch states at temperatures below the characteristic phonon frequency for any strength of the electron - phonon coupling . here",
    "we have reviewed more recent studies of small bipolarons in ionic lattices which show that the long - range frhlich interaction leads to relatively light intersite small bipolarons with the atomic size of the wave function , large binding energy and a large size of the phonon cloud .",
    "they are bloch waves with the effective mass , which is smaller by a few orders of magnitude than the mass of onsite bipolarons in the nondispersive holstein model .",
    "as discussed in a few original papers , reviews and books the bipolaron theory describes @xmath1 of many cuprates without any fitting parameters , their non fermi - liquid normal state and the non - bcs superconducting state , and predicts single - particle spectral properties compatible with the tunnelling and arpes spectroscopies of the cuprates .",
