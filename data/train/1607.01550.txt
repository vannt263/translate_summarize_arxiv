    "fortunately , the collapsar model suggests that long grbs provide a complementary tool for measuring the high-@xmath0 sfr from a different perspective , i.e. , by the means of investigating the death rate of massive stars rather than observing them directly during their lives . due to the fact that long grbs are a product of the collapses of massive stars , the cosmic grb rate should in principle trace the cosmic sfr .",

    "the minimum halo mass @xmath1 must , therefore , play a crucial role in star formation .",
    "there are a few direct constraints on @xmath1 as follows . in order to simultaneously reproduce the current baryon fraction and the early chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium , ref .",

    "in addition to the obvious method of increasing the sample size of grbs with the help of future dedicated missions , we suggest that a much more severe constraints on @xmath1 will be achieved by combining several independent observations , such as the observational data of star formation history , the luminosity distribution of galaxies , and the redshift distribution of grbs .",
