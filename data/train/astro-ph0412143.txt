    "the existence of dust disks around main - sequence stars has been known since the first days of the _ infrared astronomy satellite ( iras ) _ mission , when @xcite reported the detection of strong far - infrared ( far - ir ) excess emission toward vega ( @xmath8  lyr ) . over 200 other main - sequence stars",

    "too old to possess remnant primordial dust , that would be cleared by radiation pressure and poynting - robertson ( p - r ) drag within several million years ( myr ) in the absence of gas , these stars owe their far - ir excess to emission by `` debris disks , '' formed by the collisional fragmentation of larger bodies ( the so - called  vega phenomenon  ; * ? ? ?",

    "subsequent imaging at optical to millimeter wavelengths of the nearest sub - sample of vega - like stars has resolved intricate disk - like structures , with gaps and concentrations @xcite .",
    "the most favored explanation for such structures is the gravitational perturbation by embedded planets orbiting at semi - major axes comparable to the disk size @xcite .",
    "the existence of perturbing planets may be revealed by clumps of dust trapped in mean motion resonances , as has been suggested for vega @xcite , @xmath9  eri @xcite , and fomalhaut ( @xmath8  psa ; * ? ? ?",

    "finally , dust migration in a gas - rich disk can produce azimuthally symmetric structures , as observed in the hr  4796a circumstellar disk @xcite .",
    "high - resolution imaging observations , such as those of hr  4796a @xcite , @xmath7  pic @xcite , hd  141569a @xcite and tw  hya @xcite with the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ can help single out the most likely physical process behind the disk morphology .",
    "the resolution achievable with adaptive optics in the near - infrared on large ground - based telescopes rivals that of _ hst _ , and is the method employed in this paper for investigating disk structure .    the young ( 820  myr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) m1  v @xcite star au  mic has a known 60@xmath10 excess from _ iras _ , likely due to orbiting dust @xcite .",
    "because of its relative proximity ( _ hipparcos _ distance of 9.94@xmath11  pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , au  mic is a good target for high - resolution imaging of scattered light to characterize the circumstellar disk morphology .",
    "recent 450@xmath10 and 850@xmath10 observations by @xcite confirmed the existence of dust , and follow - up @xmath4-band ( 0.65@xmath10 ) coronagraphic imaging revealed a nearly edge - on disk extending 210  au @xcite from the star . because the age of au  mic is larger than the collision timescale between particles in the disk ( 0.55  myr at 200  au )",
    ", @xcite infer that most of the dust particles have undergone at least one ( destructive ) collision , and hence the au  mic disk is a debris disk .",
    "however , because the p - r time scale for 0.110@xmath10 particles at @xmath12100  au from the star is greater than the stellar age , @xcite expect that most of the disk at large radii consists of primordial material .",
    "@xcite find a fractional infrared luminosity , @xmath13 and fit the far - ir to sub - millimeter excess by a 40  k modified blackbody with constant emissivity for @xmath14 and following @xmath15 for longer wavelengths .",
    "from the lack of excess at 25@xmath10 , @xcite infer an inner disk edge at 17  au from the star , or 1.7@xmath16 at the distance of au  mic .",
    "they speculate that such a gap may have been opened by an orbiting planet , that , given the youth of the system , could be detectable in deep adaptive optics ( ao ) observations in the near ir .",
    "such high contrast observations could also be used to search for signatures of planet / disk interaction .",
    "the au  mic circumstellar disk is not resolved with the 14@xmath16 beam of the jcmt / scuba observations of @xcite , and the @xcite optical coronagraphic observations are insensitive to the disk at separations @xmath65@xmath16 because of the large sizes of their occulting spots ( diameters of 6.5@xmath16 and 9.5@xmath16 ) , and because of point - spread function ( psf ) artifacts .",
    "taking advantage of the higher angular resolution and dynamic range achievable with adaptive optics on large telescopes , @xcite used the keck ao system to investigate the disk morphology at separations as small as 1520  au from the star .",
    "we present our own set of keck ao data that confirms @xcite s observations , and places upper limits on the presence of potential planetary companions .",
    "in addition , we combine our spatially resolved @xmath0-band information with the @xmath4-band imaging data from @xcite , and with the optical to sub - millimeter spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of au  mic from @xcite , to put self - consistent constraints on the disk morphology and the dust properties , as done previously for @xmath7  pic @xcite .",
    "we use a full three - dimensional radiative transfer code to model simultaneously the sed and the @xmath0-band and @xmath4-band surface brightness profiles ( sbps ) .",
    "we find that our model consisting of a single dust population does not reproduce the observed break in the @xmath0-band sbp , whereas a two - component dust model , as proposed for @xmath7  pic , fits the data well .",
    "drawing from a comparison with the @xmath7  pic system , we deduce that dynamical evolution of the disk provides the simplest explanation for the morphology of the sbps of both disks .",
    "we observed au  mic at @xmath0 band ( 1.63@xmath10 ) with the nirc2 instrument ( matthews et al .",
    ", in prep . ) and the ao system @xcite on the keck  ii telescope .",
    "the data were acquired on 5 june , 2004 under photometric conditions .",
    "we employed coronagraphic spots of different sizes ( 0.6@xmath162.0@xmath16 diameter ) to block out the light from the star .",
    "the observations were taken with the wide , 0.04@xmath16  pix@xmath17 camera in nirc2 , which delivers a @xmath18 field of view ( fov ) on the 1024@xmath191024 insb alladin-3 array .",
    "we obtained nine 54  sec exposures at @xmath0 band , three with each of the 0.6@xmath16 , 1.0@xmath16 , and 2.0@xmath16-diameter coronagraphic spots .",
    "we observed the nearby ( 2.4@xmath20 separation ) m2/3  iii star hd  195720 as a psf standard , with similar colors , but 0.9  mag brighter than au  mic at @xmath0 .",
    "we spent equal amounts of time on the target , on the psf star , and on sky .",
    "the observations were carried out according to the following sequence , repeated 3 times : 3 exposures of au  mic , 3 exposures of hd  195720 , and 3 exposures of the blank sky ( taken at three dithered positions : 60@xmath16 , 50@xmath16 , and 40@xmath16 away from the psf star ) .",
    "the total on - source exposure time was 8.1  min . throughout the observations ,",
    "the field rotator was set in `` position angle mode , '' preserving the orientation of the sky on the detector .",
    "the image quality was estimated from the strehl ratios of point sources observed at higher spatial resolution ( with the narrow camera , 0.01@xmath16/pix ) at the beginning of each night .",
    "our @xmath0 band images had strehls of 1720% .",
    "data reduction followed the standard steps of sky - subtraction , flat - fielding , and bad - pixel correction .",
    "the images in the individual sets of 3 exposures were then median - combined to improve the sensitivity to faint objects .",
    "the au  mic dust disk was barely discernible at this stage ( figure  [ fig_aumic]a ) . to enhance the visibility of the dust disk",
    ", we subtracted the stellar psf .",
    "the psf was obtained by first rotating the image of hd  195720 to match the orientation of the diffraction pattern in the au  mic image , and then scaling it by a centrally symmetric function @xmath21 to match the radial dependence of the au  mic profile .",
    "the objective of the scaling was to compensate for variations in the seeing halo between au  mic and the control star caused by changing atmospheric conditions and fluctuating quality of the ao correction .",
    "the function @xmath21 was obtained as the median radial profile of the ratio of the au  mic to the hd  195720 images , with the telescope spikes and the edge - on disk masked .",
    "figure  [ fig_radprofs ] shows @xmath21 for the images with the three different coronagraphic spot sizes .",
    "two remarks on this procedure should be made here .",
    "first , the function @xmath21 does not vary by more than 15% for any given spot size , and for large radii tends to 0.4   the @xmath0-band flux ratio between au  mic and the psf star .",
    "second , because the au  mic disk happens to be edge - on , the centrally symmetric scaling of the psf does not introduce any spurious features in the result , and so does not interfere with the morphology of the disk",
    ". the procedure would not be viable for disks that are far from edge - on .    the scaled version of hd  195720 for the image with the 0.6@xmath16 coronagraph is presented in figure  [ fig_aumic]b .",
    "panel ( c ) of figure  [ fig_aumic ] shows the final au  mic image , obtained by median - combining all coronagraphic exposures . in panel ( d )",
    "a digital mask has been employed to enhance the appearance of the circumstellar disk .",
    "the mask encompasses the innermost 1.7@xmath16 from au  mic , as well as the hexagonal diffraction spikes from 2 of the 3 image sequences where they did not subtract well ( as seen in panel ( c ) of the figure ) .    for flux calibration we adopted the 2mass magnitude for au  mic ( @xmath22 ) and relied on the residual transmission of the nirc2 coronagraphic spots .",
    "the psf star , hd  195720 , is saturated in 2mass , and therefore unusable for flux calibration .",
    "we measured the flux from au  mic through the 1.0@xmath16 and 2.0@xmath16 coronagraphs in a 6  pix ( 0.24@xmath16 ) diameter aperture . from non - coronagraphic images taken with the 10  mas / pix camera on nirc2",
    ", we found that this aperture contained 68% of the total power in the psf .",
    "the @xmath0-band transmissivity of the 2@xmath16 nirc2 coronagraph was measured at @xmath23 ( extinction of @xmath24  mag ) .",
    "au  mic is known to exhibit a large @xmath25-band photometric amplitude ( 0.35  mag ) due to star spots with a period of 4.9  days @xcite .",
    "although we do not expect measurable variability over the @xmath261  hour time span of our observations , our absolute flux calibration is uncertain .",
    "nevertheless , in the near ir the contrast between the spots and the stellar photosphere is less pronounced than in the optical , so the uncertainty is also smaller : likely of order @xmath270.1  mag .    the absolute orientation of the dust disk arms was calibrated through observations of a binary star standard , wds  18055 + 0230 , with well - known orbital elements ( grade  1 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath28-axis of the nirc2 detector was measured to be offset by @xmath29 clockwise from north .",
    "all position angles quoted below have been corrected for this offset .",
    "the disk is seen out to a distance of @xmath306@xmath16 ( 60  au ) from the star in our combined @xmath0-band image ( figure  [ fig_aumic]c , d ) . inwards it can be traced inwards to @xmath261.7@xmath16 ( 17  au ) from the star , at which point residual speckle noise from the psf subtraction overwhelms the emission from the disk . thus , our imaging data can not directly test the existence of the proposed disk clearing interior to 17  au from the star @xcite .",
    "we confirm the sharp mid - plane morphology of the disk @xcite , indicating a nearly edge - on orientation , and resolve the disk thickness , with the se arm appearing somewhat thicker ( fwhm  = 2.84.4  au ) than the nw arm ( fwhm  = 2.24.0  au ) .",
    "there is also evidence of an increase in the fwhm of each of the arms with separation : from 2.22.8  au at 20  au to 4.04.4  au at 40  au from the star , indicating a potential non - zero opening angle of the disk . within 5@xmath16 of au  mic ,",
    "the position angles ( pas ) of the two sides of the disk are nearly 180@xmath20 away from each other : we measure pa  = 310.1@xmath310.2@xmath20 for the nw arm , and pa  = 129.5@xmath310.4@xmath20 for the se arm .",
    "these pas are in agreement with those reported in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and 129.3@xmath310.8@xmath20 ) , though more accurate , likely as a result of our proper calibration of the orientation of the nirc2 detector ( section  2 ) .",
    "the radial sbp of the disk was measured on the reduced image ( figure  [ fig_aumic]c ; before applying the digital mask ) using the iraf task polyphot .",
    "the photometry regions are indicated by the rectangles overlapped onto a contour map of the image in figure  [ fig_contours]a .",
    "we used 4  pix  @xmath19 12  pix ( @xmath32 ) rectangular apertures , where the long side of the rectangular regions was chosen to span 12 fwhms of the disk thickness , and was aligned normally to the disk arm .",
    "the distance between the aperture centers was 4  pix ( @xmath33 ) . even though the image was psf- and sky - subtracted , to offset for flux biases introduced by the centrally symmetric scaling of the psf ( section  2),we employed additional background subtraction , with the background flux estimated as the median pixel value in 0.16@xmath16-wide concentric annuli centered on the star .",
    "the photometric uncertainty was estimated as the quadrature sum of the standard deviation of the background and the photon noise from the disk .",
    "for the standard deviation of the background we adopted the root mean square ( r.m.s . ) of the pixel values in the annulus , multiplied by @xmath34 ( to properly account for the standard deviation of the median ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and normalized by the size of the photometry aperture .",
    "the radial sbps of the nw ( upward pointing triangles ) and se ( downward pointing triangles ) arms of the projected disk are shown in figure  [ fig_sbps ] .",
    "the two sbps agree well throughout the region over which we can trace the disk ( 1760  au ) .",
    "unlike the observed shape of the @xmath4-band sbp at 50210  au , the @xmath0-band sbp at 1760  au from the star can not be fit by a single power law . instead , the sbps of both the nw and the se arms `` kink '' and flatten inwards of 3040  au , with the transition being more abrupt in the se arm at @xmath2633  au , and more gradual in the nw arm .",
    "while the power - law exponent of the mean sbp over the entire range ( 1760  au ) is @xmath35 , over 1733  au separations it flattens to @xmath36 , while over 3360  au , it increases to @xmath37",
    ". these are consistent with the measurements of @xcite over the same separation range .    a closer look at the sbp of the nw and se arms reveals several small - scale asymmetries , all of which can be linked to regions of non - uniform brightness in the au  mic disk ( figure  [ fig_contours]a ) . the sub - structure is enhanced by scaling the reduced image by a radially symmetric function centered on the star , with magnitude proportional to the radius squared ( figure  [ fig_contours]b ) .",
    "the lettered structures denote features identified in the ( deeper ) image of @xcite : clumps of enhanced emission ( a , and c ) , a gap ( b ) , and a region elevated with respect to the inner disk mid - plane ( d ) . in general , we confirm the presence of these features in the au  mic disk , although the gap ( b ) and the clump ( a ) appear misplaced by @xmath305  au toward the star in our image .",
    "the nw arm also looks more uniform in brightness between 1740  au in our image compared to that in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figures 3 and 4 ) , where clump a is very prominent .",
    "these discrepancies may be caused by residual speckle noise from the psf subtraction in either data set .",
    "in addition to the features described by @xcite , we see a faint clump in the nw arm at @xmath1250  au from the star , coincident with the location of the bump in the sbp of this arm ( figure  [ fig_sbps ] ) . the concentration is not reported by @xcite , and being at a relatively low signal - to - noise ( @xmath263 ) , may be a noise spike .",
    "the integrated disk brightness ( over 1760  au from the star ) is 2.7@xmath380.8  mjy at @xmath0 band ; hence @xmath39 .",
    "this is comparable to the fractional dust luminosity in emitted mid - ir to sub - mm light , @xmath40 @xcite , and hence suggests that the disk mid - plane may be optically thin to radiation at wavelengths as short as @xmath301.5@xmath10 , at the peak of the au  mic spectrum .",
    "indeed , @xmath41 is similar to that of other known debris disks ( @xmath42 ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , all of which are optically thin to ultra - violet and optical light in the direction perpendicular to the disk plane ( @xmath43 ) . in the mid - plane ,",
    "the optical depth of grains along a radial line from the star to infinity is @xmath44 if the grains are in a `` wedge '' or `` flaring '' disk with thickness proportional to radius and opening angle @xmath45 @xcite . because of the generally unknown viewing geometry of circumstellar disks",
    ", @xmath46 tends to be poorly constrained . assuming edge - on orientation ( @xmath47 )",
    ", we can estimate the maximum allowed opening angle @xmath45 from the observed disk thickness . for smaller values of @xmath48 , @xmath49 will be smaller because of projection effects . assuming a perfectly flat , thin disk , we find a lower limit on the inclination @xmath50 over 2050  au .",
    "the projected appearance of an inclined disk of zero thickness would however be inconsistent with the apparent thickening of the disk with increasing separation ( section  [ sec_morph ] ) .",
    "therefore , the disk likely has non - zero scale height and/or opening angle , and is viewed within only a degree of edge - on . to put a limit on @xmath49 , we observe that at a radius of 40  au the disk fwhm is @xmath304  au .",
    "thus we obtain that for @xmath51 , @xmath52 .",
    "hence , @xmath53 , and probably less than unity , i.e. , the disk is optically thin in the radial direction .",
    "dynamical influence by embedded planets is a frequently invoked explanation for substructure in dust disks . because of its youth , proximity , and late spectral type , au",
    "mic is an ideal target for direct imaging of planets .",
    "however , no point sources are seen in our combined 8.1  min psf - subtracted @xmath0 band exposure .",
    "figure  [ fig_detlims ] delineates our 5@xmath54 sensitivity limits as a function of angular separation from the star in the psf - subtracted image .",
    "the 1@xmath54 level at each distance is defined as the r.m.s .",
    "scatter of the pixel values in one - pixel wide annuli centered on the star .",
    "this was divided by @xmath55 to adjust for the finite size of the aperture used for photometry ( six - pixel diameter , or an area of 28.3  pix@xmath56 ) .",
    "the sensitivity to point sources within the disk is up to 1  mag poorer because of the higher photon noise .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig_detlims ] with the points , each of which has the photon noise from the disk signal added in quadrature .",
    "these detection limits , calculated in a statistical manner , were confirmed through limited experiments with artificially planted stars .    at the location of the inferred gap in the se arm ( @xmath302530  au ) , we can detect planets down to 1 jupiter mass ( @xmath2 ) for an assumed stellar age of 10  myr and using brown - dwarf cooling models from @xcite .",
    "dynamical models of planet - disk interactions in other systems exhibiting similar disk morphology ( @xmath9  eri , @xmath8  lyr ) require planets 0.13  @xmath2 @xcite . provided that the clumps in the au  mic disk are caused by such a planet , our point source detection limits constrain its mass to the lower part of this range .    a faint candidate companion is seen around our psf star , hd  195720 ( @xmath57 from 2mass ) .",
    "the object is 9.5@xmath380.2  mag fainter at @xmath0 , at a projected separation of 1.19@xmath16 and pa of 81@xmath20 ( figure  [ fig_aumic]b ) .",
    "given that hd  195720 is a distant giant star ( spectral type m23  iii from simbad ) , if associated , the companion would be a main - sequence k star .",
    "because of the large magnitude difference , the presence of the projected companion does not affect our psf subtraction or the analysis of the au  mic circumstellar disk .",
    "it has already been suggested that the structures in the au  mic disk ( dust concentrations , gaps , vertically displaced clumps ) are likely signposts of the existence of perturbing planetary - mass bodies in the au  mic disk @xcite .",
    "the proposed clearing in the disk inwards of 17  au @xcite supports such a hypothesis . from our imaging data we can not trace the disk to separations",
    "@xmath617  au to directly test the existence of a gap . however ,",
    "by combining our knowledge of the optical to sub - mm data on the au  mic debris disk with an appropriate model , we can still probe some of the physical properties of the disk , including the size of the inner gap . in this section we present results from a three - dimensional continuum radiative transfer code , mc3d @xcite , to simultaneously model the au  mic sed and the scattered light from the disk , and to place constraints on the dust grain size distribution , the radial particle density distribution , and the inner disk radius .",
    "the mc3d code is based on the monte carlo method and solves the radiative transfer problem self - consistently .",
    "it estimates the spatial temperature distribution of circumstellar dust , and takes into account absorption and multiple scattering events .",
    "given the non - vanishing mid - plane optical depth of the au  mic disk ( section  [ sec_tau ] ) , we believe that the use of a multi - scattering approach is warranted . the code employs the concept of enforced scattering @xcite , where in a medium of optical depth @xmath58 , a fraction @xmath59 of each photon leaves the model space without interaction , while the remaining part ( @xmath60 ) is scattered .",
    "the code is therefore applicable to the low - density environments of circumstellar debris disks .",
    "the dust grains are assumed to be spherical with a power - law size distribution , @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "we used a standard inter - stellar medium ( ism ) mixture of 62.5% astronomical silicate and @xmath62 graphite @xcite , with optical properties from @xcite .",
    "the extinction and scattering cross sections , and the scattering distribution function are modeled following the mie scattering algorithm of @xcite .",
    "we use the mc3d code to model the @xmath4 and @xmath0 band scattered light in the au  mic disk , and the ir to sub - mm excess in the sed .",
    "the au  mic photosphere is best approximated by a 3600  k nextgen model @xcite , as expected from its spectral type ( m1  v ) .",
    "the fit was performed over the 112@xmath10 wavelength range , where the emission is photospheric .",
    "data from the literature at shorter wavelengths were ignored , as they are not taken simultaneously , and hence are strongly affected by the @xmath63  mag variability of the star . by matching the model @xmath64-band flux density to that of a blackbody of the same temperature , and adopting the _ hipparcos _ distance of 9.94  pc to the star , we find that its luminosity and radius are @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively . for the debris disk",
    "we adopt a flat ( unflared ) geometry with a number density profile proportional to @xmath67 , where @xmath68 denotes radial distance from the star , and @xmath69 is a constant .",
    "we set the outer radius of the model to 1000  au , so that it is larger than the size of the @xmath4-band scattered light emission ( 210  au ) , and of the jcmt / scuba beam used for the sub - mm measurements ( fwhm of @xmath70  au ) .",
    "the disk inclination and opening angle were already constrained in section  [ sec_tau ] . for our modeling purposes",
    "we assume @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and a flat disk model with a constant scale height @xmath73=0.8  au .",
    "we find that models based on these parameters approximate the mean observed disk thickness well .",
    "the remaining free parameters in the disk model are the exponent of the volume density profile @xmath69 , the dust mass @xmath74 , the minimum and maximum dust grain sizes @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and the inner radius @xmath77 .",
    "a fit to the mean nw and se sbp between 1760  au results in a best - fit power - law index of @xmath78 , indicating that the number density profile varies as @xmath79 , i.e. , @xmath80 ( as is true for an edge - on disk of isotropically scattering grains ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . even though forward scattering is ignored in the approximation @xmath81 , it is modeled by the mc3d code , where its amount is determined by the input grain parameters and mie theory",
    "this value is in agreement with the range inferred for p - r drag dominated disks ( 1.01.3 ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "given the error on our fit , we decide to fix the value of the power - law index at the theoretically expected value of @xmath82 for a continuously replenished dust cloud in equilibrium under p - r drag @xcite .",
    "the effects of varying @xmath69 are considered at the end of section  [ sec_degen ] .",
    "we subsequently follow a trial - and - error by - eye optimization scheme to determine the values of @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 . with a sophisticated dust disk model containing many parameter choices , it is possible to find combinations of parameters that have degenerate effects on the sed and/or on the sbp . by fitting simultaneously the sed and the imaging data we can avoid some , but not all , of the complications . here",
    "we discuss the specific degeneracies and how we can break them via the observational constraints in hand .",
    "we first consider the interaction between @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , which are strongly degenerate .",
    "we then consider the effect of changing @xmath83 , which is more weakly coupled with the rest of the parameters .",
    "finally , we extend our discussion to consider variations in the power - law index @xmath69 , which is otherwise kept fixed during the modeling .",
    "the dust mass @xmath74 , and the minimum and maximum grain sizes , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , have degenerate effects on both the sbp and the sed . decreasing @xmath74 , or increasing @xmath75 or @xmath76 ,",
    "result in a decrease in the amount of mass residing in small grains ( the bulk of the scatterers ) , and lowers the flux of the sbp .",
    "each of these changes similarly lowers the thermal sed flux .",
    "however , dust mass variations can be disentangled from grain size variations because of the different magnitudes of their effects on the sbp and on the sed .",
    "optically thin thermal emission is a more accurate proxy of dust mass , whereas optical - ir scattering is more sensitive to small differences in the mean grain size .",
    "we therefore constrain @xmath74 from the sub - mm data , while we use the color and absolute flux of the scattered light to determine @xmath75 and @xmath76 . here",
    "we should note that @xmath74 represents only the dust mass contained in grains comparable in size or smaller than the maximum wavelength ( @xmath84 ) at which thermal emission is observed . in the case of au  mic ,",
    "the currently existing longest - wavelength observations are at 850@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "consequently , we are free to adjust @xmath75 and @xmath76 , as long as @xmath85  mm",
    ". we will not consider cases for which @xmath86  mm .",
    "as a first step in finding the optimum model parameters , we confirm the @xcite estimate of the dust mass , @xmath87 , calculated from the 850@xmath10 flux .",
    "this value matches the sub - mm data points for a wide range ( an order of magnitude ) of minimum and maximum grain sizes , whereas changing @xmath88 by a factor of @xmath31.5 introduces significant discrepancies from the observed 850@xmath10 emission . as a next step ,",
    "we constrain @xmath75 by modeling the optical - near - ir color of the scattered light in the overlap region ( 5060  au ) between the @xcite @xmath4-band and our @xmath0-band data .",
    "because the size of the smallest grains is likely comparable to the central wavelengths of the @xmath4 and @xmath0 bands , @xmath89 is a sensitive diagnostic for @xmath75 .",
    "we smooth the @xmath4- and @xmath0-band model images to the respective image resolutions ( 1.1@xmath16 at @xmath4 and 0.04@xmath16 at @xmath0 ) , and use the appropriate aperture widths ( 1.2@xmath16 at @xmath4 [ @xcite ] and 0.48@xmath16 [ this work ] ) .",
    "for the adopted grain size distribution we find that models with @xmath90 , with a probable range of 0.31.0@xmath10 , best approximate the disk color .",
    "having constrained @xmath74 and @xmath75 , we find that @xmath91 matches best the @xmath4- and @xmath0-band flux levels of the disk .",
    "the probable range for @xmath76 is 1001000@xmath10 .",
    "since we have not considered models with @xmath92  mm , we can not put an upper limit to the maximum grain size .",
    "the inner radius @xmath77 of the disk is degenerate with the mean dust grain size in the sed .",
    "greater values of @xmath77 decrease the mid - ir flux and shift the peak of the excess to longer wavelengths ( figure  [ fig_degen]a ) , as do greater values of @xmath75 ( figure  [ fig_degen]b ) and @xmath76 . because the au  mic disk is optically thin in the mid - plane ( section  [ sec_tau ] )",
    ", the inner disk radius has no effect on the flux and color of the sbp , facilitating the isolation of the @xmath77 parameter .",
    "having already determined @xmath75 and @xmath76 , we find @xmath93  au : smaller than the 17  au gap estimated from the single - temperature blackbody fit in @xcite . a firm upper limit of @xmath94  au can be set based on the fact that we do not observe a decrease in the intensity of the scattered light with decreasing separation down to 17  au ( figure  [ fig_sbps ] ; see",
    "also figure  2 in * ? ? ?",
    "finally , although we had fixed the value of the power - law index @xmath69 , a brief discussion of its variation is warranted given the change in the sbp with radius .",
    "the action of @xmath69 on the sed is degenerate with the dust size , and with the radius of the inner gap .",
    "larger values of @xmath69 are degenerate with smaller particles and smaller inner gap radii ( figure  [ fig_degen ] ) .",
    "given that at @xmath533  au the power - law index of the sbp decreases to @xmath95 ( i.e. , @xmath96 ) , and that most of the mid - ir flux is produced close ( 1020  au ) to au  mic , the inner disk clearing may therefore be smaller than 10  au in radius .",
    "indeed , recent _ hst _ scattered light imaging @xcite detects the disk in to 7.5  au ( although the authors invoke forward scattering to account for the apparent filling in of the inner gap ) . compounding this with evidence for an increasing minimum grain size with decreasing radial separation ( section  [ sec_grains ] )",
    ", we find that inner gap sizes as small as @xmath97  au can not be ruled out .",
    "table  [ tab_model ] lists our preferred model parameters for the au  mic star - disk system .",
    "the optical depth of the model along the disk mid - plane is @xmath98 at both @xmath4 and @xmath0 bands , in agreement with the estimates in section  [ sec_tau ] .",
    "the model sbp and sed are over - plotted on the data in figures  [ fig_sbps ] and [ fig_sed ] , respectively .",
    "figure  [ fig_contours]c shows the noiseless scattered light model of the au  mic disk with the same greyscale and contour spacing as the image in figure  [ fig_contours]a .",
    "the model disk extends to larger radial separations than the au  mic disk : an effect of the steeper power law of the au  mic sbp at @xmath333  au .",
    "two important new results are evident from our simultaneous modeling of the sbp and sed of the au  mic debris disk : ( 1 ) there is a pronounced lack of small ( @xmath60.3@xmath10 ) grains in the inner disk , and ( 2 ) the radius of the inner clearing may be smaller ( 110  au ) than estimated ( 17  au ) from a simple black - body fit to the ir excess @xcite .",
    "the latter point was already discussed in section  [ sec_degen ] , and , given the shortcomings of our model in reproducing the changing slope of the sbp , will not be belabored further . here",
    "we discuss the derived minimum grain size along with recent evidence for its dependence on disk radius .",
    "we then focus on the change in slope of the sbp of the au  mic debris disk , and draw a parallel with the @xmath7  pic system .",
    "we propose that identical dynamical processes in the two debris disks can explain the observed homology .      from the model fits to the color and absolute flux of the scattered light from the au  mic debris disk ,",
    "we find that the dust grains are between @xmath99 and @xmath100 in size ( although the 1  mm upper limit on the maximum grain size is not robust ) . in reality ,",
    "our constraints on the grain parameters are valid only over the 5060  au region , where we have information from both the @xmath89 color of the scattered light and the sed .",
    "we have very few constraints for the outer disk ( @xmath101  au ) , which is seen only in @xmath4-band scattered light and is too cold to be detected in emission at wavelengths @xmath61  mm .",
    "shortly before receiving the referee report for this paper , sensitive high - resolution 0.40.8@xmath10 images of au  mic became available from _ hst _ @xcite .",
    "these show the debris disk over 7.5150  au separations from the star and thus provide complete overlap with our ao data .",
    "a brief discussion of the two data sets in the context of the minimum grain size is therefore warranted . for consistency with @xcite",
    ", we re - did our surface photometry with the @xmath102 apertures used by these authors .",
    "because the two data sets have similar angular resolution ( 0.04@xmath16 vs.0.07@xmath16 ) , and because the aperture size is much larger than the fwhm of the psfs , the systematics of the photometry should be negligible .",
    "the @xcite _ hst _ @xmath103 ( 0.59@xmath10 ) data are consistent with the @xcite ground - based @xmath4-band ( 0.65@xmath10 ) observations over 5060  au from the star , and thus our conclusions about the grain sizes in this region remain unchanged .",
    "however , a comparison of the @xmath0-band and the @xmath103-band sbp over the region of overlap shows that the @xmath104 color changes from 2.9@xmath380.2  mag ( i.e. , approximately neutral , since @xmath105 for au  mic ) at 1720  au to 2.0@xmath380.3  mag at 5060  au .",
    "that is , the debris disk becomes increasingly bluer at larger radii .",
    "the effect is gradual and is also reported in @xcite , where it is observed over a narrower wavelength range ( 0.40.8@xmath10 ) at 3060  au from the star .",
    "the neutral color of the dust at 20  au indicates that the majority of scatterers there are larger than 1.6@xmath10 .",
    "compared with the minimum grain size ( @xmath106 ) that we derived at 5060  au , this indicates that at smaller separations grains are bigger .",
    "such a dependence of grain size on radius would further imply that the radius at which the sbp changes power - law index should be wavelength - dependent , occurring farther away from the star at shorter wavelengths .",
    "evidence for this may indeed be inferred from a comparison between the _ hst _ and keck ao data : in the @xmath103 acs filter the break in the sbp is seen at @xmath2643  au @xcite , whereas at @xmath0-band it occurs near 3335  au ( section  [ sec_morph ] ; * ? ? ?",
    "the indication that the minimum grain size decreases with disk radius is thus confirmed from two independent observations .",
    "particles smaller than @xmath75 may be removed as a result of either coagulation into larger particles ( grain growth ) , destruction by p - r and/or corpuscular drag , or radiation pressure blow - out . given that @xmath75 is larger than the radiation pressure blow - out size ( 0.14@xmath10 , for a radiation pressure to gravity ratio @xmath7=0.5 and a grain density of 2.5  g  @xmath107 ) , grain collisions and drag forces dominate the dynamics of @xmath30.14@xmath10 grains around au  mic .",
    "therefore , the origin of the sub - micron grains scattering visible light at wide separations ( where the collision and p - r time scales are longer than the age of the star ) may also be primordial : rather than being blown out from the inner disk , these grains may be remnant from the proto - stellar cloud that never coagulated beyond an ism grain size distribution .",
    "it is not surprising that our preferred model can not reproduce the detailed structure of our high angular resolution ir image .",
    "the model parameters were found only after a coarse sampling of the parameter space , and through a number of simplistic assumptions that merely approximate the physical conditions in the au  mic debris disk . in particular , under the assumption of a uniform grain size and density distribution over 101000  au",
    ", the mc3d model can not mimic the sbp slope change at @xmath3033  au and the clumpy substructure over 1760  au described in @xcite and confirmed in section  [ sec_morph ] . while the dust clumps are high - order perturbations that may require dynamical considerations for proper modeling , the change in the sbp potentially could be explained in the framework of existing dust disk scenarios .",
    "the occurrence of the power - law break at similar radii in the sbps both arms of the projected disk suggests that this is a ring - like structure surrounding the star , rather than a discrete feature at one location in the disk .",
    "models involving dynamical interaction with planets have been proposed to explain ring - like structures in circumstellar disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the clumpy structure of the au  mic disk does suggest the presence of unseen planets @xcite . however , such models tend to produce discrete rings , as around hr  4796a and hd  141569a , rather than the radially dimming sbp of the au  mic disk .",
    "similar changes in the power - law index have also been seen in the sbps of other resolved circumstellar disks : @xmath7  pic ( @xcite , @xcite ) , tw  hya @xcite , and hd  100546 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a different mechanism , not necessarily involving planets , may be at play in these systems .",
    "the tw  hya and hd  100546 circumstellar disks are gas - rich and have large mid - plane optical depths , and hence are very much unlike the gas - poor @xcite , optically thin au  mic debris disk . however , a comparison with @xmath7  pic is particularly illuminating , because of the similar viewing geometry of the two systems , and their identical ages . in the remainder of this section",
    "we seek a common disk architecture that can self - consistently account for the broken power - law morphology of the sbps of these two debris disks .",
    "the sbp of @xmath7  pic exhibits a break at 56@xmath16 ( 100120  au ) from the star ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) , with similar values ( from 1 to 4 ) of the power - law index on either side of the break as in the sbp of au  mic . from @xmath108-band ( 0.21@xmath10 ) ao observations resolving the @xmath7  pic disk over 1.5@xmath166@xmath16 , @xcite observe the break at a somewhat smaller radius , 44.5@xmath16 ( 7585  au ) , with a smaller change in the sbp power - law index ( from 1 to 3 )",
    ". this may be the inner edge of the sbp break observed in the visible , or may indicate a wavelength - dependence of the @xmath7  pic break radius similar to the one potentially seen in the au  mic disk ( section  [ sec_grains ] ) .",
    "however , because the @xcite @xmath108-band data do not extend beyond the optical break radius ( 6@xmath16 ) , and because the change in the power - law index observed at @xmath108 does not span the full range of power - law indices inferred from optical imaging , this data set will not be considered further .",
    "@xcite model the break in optical sbp of the @xmath7  pic disk using two different power laws for the number density of dust particles in the disk , for radii less than or greater than 100  au , respectively .",
    "@xcite consider the possibility of differing grain sizes , in addition . while either model may correctly describe the architecture of the @xmath7  pic disk , both are purely phenomenological , as they do not model the physics behind the discontinuity in the disk .",
    "based on the apparent homology between these two debris disks , we believe that a plausible two - component model should be able to explain both systems self - consistently . in light of this , several physical scenarios from the subsequent literature are considered below .",
    "we find that none of them offer a unique explanation , and propose separate hypotheses in sections  [ sec_collisions ] and [ sec_pr ] .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggest that the discontinuity in the sbp of @xmath7  pic may correspond to the location of the `` ice boundary '' in the disk : all dust particles at separations @xmath3100  au are covered with ice , while at shorter separations some may not be .",
    "this results in a deficiency of highly reflective particles in the inner regions , creating a shallower power - law index for the scattered light profile . in an optically thin disk",
    "the radius of the ice boundary should scale as the square root of the stellar luminosity .",
    "adopting @xmath109 ( table  [ tab_model ] ) , and @xmath110 , and assuming identical grain chemistry in the two systems , we find that the corresponding boundary around au  mic should scale down to a radius of 1315  au ; too close to account for the break at 33  au .",
    "an alternative hypothesis , involving dust extraction through evaporation of gas from a reservoir of cometary bodies around @xmath7  pic is proposed by @xcite . however , the radial distance of this evaporating reservoir should scale in the same manner as that of the ice boundary .",
    "hence , neither of these two hypotheses can be applied simultaneously to au  mic and @xmath7  pic .",
    "a reservoir of parent bodies at a discrete range of separations from au  mic could explain the kink in the sbp .",
    "@xcite calculate that the main asteroid belt in the solar system should produce a break in the power - law index of the number density distribution of interplanetary grains from @xmath111 to @xmath112 at 0.53.0  au from the sun .",
    "these predictions are consistent with empirical data from radar meteors and from impact detectors on spacecraft @xcite .",
    "the inner edge of this belt of asteroids in the au  mic and @xmath7  pic systems would be at the location of the kinks , at @xmath3033  au and @xmath30110  au from the stars , respectively . by continuing the analogy with the solar system",
    ", such belts of parent bodies would likely need to be maintained in a discrete range of orbits through mean motion resonances with planets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "that is , this particular scenario may provide further indication for the existence of planets in the two disks , in addition to the evidence arising from the their clumpy structure .",
    "however , this model is poorly constrained , as we are free to invoke a belt of parent bodies at any distance from either star .      for two stars of the same age , the disk around the more massive star",
    "is expected to be collisionally evolved out to a greater radius , because of the inverse scaling of the orbital period ( and hence , collision frequency ) with orbital radius and stellar mass .",
    "the collisional time scale for particles of mean size @xmath113 on a circular orbit of radius @xmath68 from a star of mass @xmath114 is @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the orbital period , and @xmath117 is the normalization constant for the number density distribution , that we presume scales as @xmath74 . given the approximate ratios of the stellar masses of au  mic and @xmath7  pic ( 0.28 , assuming @xmath118 ) , and of their circumstellar dust masses , ( @xmath119 , where the mass of the @xmath7  pic disk was taken as the average of the estimates from @xcite and @xcite ) and assuming 33  au and 110  au as the radii of the kinks in the corresponding sbps , we find that for @xmath120 the collisional time scales at the respective separations around the two stars are equal .",
    "this would imply sbps decreasing approximately as @xmath121 , which is within the ranges found in section  [ sec_morph ] for au  mic and in @xcite for @xmath7  pic , and agrees with the fit to the mean au  mic @xmath0-band sbp ( power - law index of @xmath35 ; figure  [ fig_sbps ] ) .",
    "therefore , in this scenario the two disk systems scale correctly within the errors , indicating that whatever process we are observing may scale with the mean time between inter - particle collisions .",
    "although the collisional time - scale at the location of the break in the au  mic sbp is considerably shorter ( 13  myr ) than the age of the star ( 820  myr ) , other , slower processes in the disk , e.g. , grain growth , may scale linearly with the time between particle collisions . as noted in section  [ sec_grains ]",
    ", grain growth could also explain the observed dependence of grain size with orbital radius .",
    "the observed change in the power - law index of the sbp may be a reflection of the finite lifetimes of sub - micron grains in the inner disk .",
    "having ruled out radiation pressure as a dominant force on grains larger than 0.14@xmath10 ( section  [ sec_grains ] ) , we propose a hypothesis based on drag forces for grain removal , in particular p - r drag .",
    "although corpuscular drag may dominate the dynamics of dust around m stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the strength of stellar winds from m dwarfs remains largely unknown .",
    "we therefore ignore corpuscular drag in the following analysis ( though see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion of the role of corpuscular drag in the au  mic disk ) , and consider only p - r drag . as long as the magnitude of the corpuscular drag force around au  mic is not much greater than the magnitude of the p - r drag force ,",
    "the conclusions remain unchanged .",
    "if p - r drag was responsible for the depletion of micron - sized grains in the inner disks of au  mic and @xmath7  pic , then the p - r lifetime ( @xmath122 ) of the smallest grains @xmath75 should be constant as a function of disk radius @xmath68 , and should equal the age of the stars ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "this can be inferred from the expression for the p - r lifetime of a particle of size @xmath113 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath124 where , @xmath125 is the mean grain density ( 2.5  g  @xmath107 for silicates ) , and @xmath126 is the speed of light . based on the assumption that p - r drag is the dominant removal mechanism for grains larger than the blow - out size ( 0.14@xmath10 ) , the p - r lifetime of the smallest grains is @xmath127 .",
    "note , however , that the size of the smallest grains , @xmath75 , is not a constant , but varies as @xmath128 .    for au  mic we found @xmath129 at 5060",
    "au , and @xmath130 at 1720  au ( section  [ sec_grains ] ) .",

    "we only note that from mid - ir and visual images , @xcite find that they require `` few - micron - sized '' silicate grains ice grains is found to be equally plausible .",
    "however , its grain properties differ widely from the ones adopted for the au  mic circumstellar dust in this paper . ] to model the scattered light at @xmath36.0@xmath16 ( @xmath3115  au ) from the star . assuming a minimum grain size of 3@xmath10",
    ", we find @xmath133  myr around @xmath7  pic .",
    "given the uncertainty in @xmath75 , the obtained p - r time - scales are not constrained to better than a factor of 1.52 .",
    "nevertheless , they are remarkably similar and agree well with the ages of au  mic and @xmath7  pic .",
    "we find that dynamical scenarios based on collisional evolution or p - r drag in debris disks offer simpler and more self - consistent accounts of the homology between the sbps of the au  mic and @xmath7  pic debris disks , compared to scenarios relying on ice / grain evaporation or belts of orbiting parent bodies .",
    "moreover , both our hypotheses can account for the inferred decrease in the minimum grain size with increasing separation from au  mic . we therefore conclude that both are plausible .",
    "given the similarities in their predictions , we do not single out which one of them is more likely , but defer that analysis to a more detailed theoretical work .",
    "regardless of which of the two processes is found to be dominant , we can confidently claim that optically thin circumstellar disks exhibiting breaks in their sbps are observed in transition between a primordial and a debris state .",
    "we have used ao @xmath0-band observations of scattered light to probe the morphology of the debris disk at 1760  au from the young nearby m dwarf au  mic .",
    "we find that the disk is within @xmath301@xmath20 of edge - on , and that it exhibits a number of morphological peculiarities : radial asymmetry , spatially resolved clumps , and a change in the power - law index of the surface brightness profile near 33  au .",
    "the observed morphology agrees with that reported in @xcite , and is suggestive of the existence of planetary perturbers in the disk .",
    "no planets are detected down to @xmath134 at @xmath320  au .",
    "we use a monte carlo three - dimensional dust disk model to constrain the overall disk parameters , by optimizing them against the au  mic sed , and near - ir and optical scattered light images of the disk ( this paper ; * ? ? ?",
    "the combined use of sed data tracing the thermal emission from large grains , and of imaging data tracing grain properties , allows us to break several important degeneracies in models of circumstellar disks that can not be resolved using only one of the two data sets . from the sed we confirm the previously inferred @xcite circumstellar dust mass of 0.011@xmath135 , and from the properties of the scattered light we infer that the debris particles are @xmath136 in size at 5060  au from au  mic .",
    "we find tentative evidence for a maximum grain size of @xmath137 .",
    "however , since the data are not sensitive to particles @xmath1381  mm , the result is consistent with no upper limit on the grain size . assuming a single dust size and density distribution",
    ", we estimate that the radius of the inner disk clearing is 10  au .",
    "however , smaller ( @xmath301  au ) gap sizes can not be ruled out if a shallower density profile ( as observed inwards of 33  au ) and/or larger grains in the inner disk ( as evidenced from the optical - near - ir color of the disk ) are adopted .",
    "we attribute the lack of sub - micron particles in the inner disk either to grain growth , or destruction by p - r and/or corpuscular drag ( for grains @xmath30.14@xmath10 ) , or to blow - out by radiation pressure ( for grains @xmath60.14@xmath10 ) .",
    "all of these mechanisms can explain the increase in relative density of small grains with increasing radius in the disk .",
    "the mc3d model can account for the overall disk profile and colors to first order , although our one - component model fails to reproduce higher - order effects , such as the change in power - law index of the sbp .",
    "we have discussed a number of scenarios which may be capable of reproducing such a change in the joint context of the au  mic and @xmath7  pic debris disks .",
    "we find that models dividing the disk into two separate components , with different grain distribution and/or composition , represent the combined sed and imaging data best .",
    "in particular , classes of models which scale with the collision or the p - r time - scale are most likely to explain both debris disks self - consistently .",
    "future high - dynamic range imaging observations probing closer to au  mic ( e.g. , with nulling interferometry in the mid - ir ) will further narrow down the architecture of its debris disk .",
    "photometric and spectroscopic observations with _ spitzer _",
    "could better constrain the sed of au  mic , and could be used to look for spectroscopic features .",

    "<S> no planets are seen in our @xmath0-band image down to a limiting mass of 1  @xmath2 at @xmath320  au , although the existence of smaller planets can not be excluded from the current data . </S>",
    "<S> modeling of the disk surface brightness distribution at @xmath0-band and @xmath4-band , in conjunction with the optical to sub - millimeter spectral energy distribution , allows us to constrain the disk geometry and the dust grain properties . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm the nearly edge - on orientation of the disk inferred from previous observations , and deduce an inner clearing radius @xmath510  au . </S>",
    "<S> we find evidence for a lack of small grains in the inner ( @xmath660  au ) disk , either as a result of primordial disk evolution , or because of destruction by poynting - robertson and/or corpuscular drag . </S>",
    "<S> a change in the power - law index of the surface brightness profile is observed near 33  au , similar to a feature known in the profile of the @xmath7  pic circumstellar debris disk . by comparing the time scales for inter - particle collisions and poynting - robertson drag between the two systems </S>",
    "<S> , we argue that the breaks are linked to one of these two processes . </S>"
