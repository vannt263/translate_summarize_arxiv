    "balanced detection provides a unique tool for many physical , biological and chemical applications . in particular , it has proven useful for improving the coherent detection in telecommunication systems @xcite , in the measurement of polarization squeezing @xcite , for the detection of polarization states of weak signals via homodyne detection @xcite , and in the study of light - atom interactions @xcite .",
    "interestingly , balanced detection has proved to be useful when performing highly sensitive magnetometry @xcite , even at the shot - noise level , in the continuous - wave @xcite and pulsed regimes @xcite .",
    "the detection of light pulses at the shot - noise level with low or negligible noise contributions , namely from detection electronics ( electronic noise ) and from intensity fluctuations ( technical noise ) , is of paramount importance in many quantum optics experiments .",
    "while electronic noise can be overcome by making use of better electronic equipment , technical noise requires special techniques to filter it , such as balanced detection and spectral filtering .",
    "even though several schemes have been implemented to overcome these noise sources @xcite , an optimal shot - noise signal recovery technique that can deal with both technical and electronic noises , has not been presented yet . in this paper",
    ", we provide a new tool based both on balanced detection and on the precise calculation of a specific pattern function that allows the optimal , shot - noise limited , signal recovery by digital filtering . to demonstrate its efficiency , we implement pattern - function filtering in the presence of strong technical and electronic noises .",
    "we demonstrate that up to 10  db of technical noise for the highest average power of the beam , after balanced detection , can be removed from the signal .",
    "this is especially relevant in the measurement of polarization - rotation angles , where technical noise can not be completely removed by means of balanced detectors @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we show that our scheme outperforms the wiener filter , a widely used method in signal processing @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : pattern ] we present the theoretical model of the proposed technique , in section [ sec : experiment ] we show the operation of this tool by designing and implementing an experiment , where high amount of noise ( technical and electronic ) is filtered . finally in section",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we present the conclusions .",
    "to optimally recover a pulsed signal in a balanced detection scheme , it is necessary to characterize the detector response , as well as the `` electronic '' and `` technical '' noise contributions @xcite .",
    "we now introduce the theoretical framework of the filtering technique and show how optimal pulsed signal recovery can be achieved .      to model a balanced detector , see fig .",
    "[ fig : expsetup ] , we assume that it consists of 1 ) a polarizing beam splitter ( pbs ) , which splits the @xmath0 and @xmath1 polarization components to two different detectors 2 ) the two detectors pd@xmath2 and pd@xmath3 , whose output currents are directly subtracted , and 3 ) a linear amplifier    because the amplification is linear and stationary , we can describe the response of the detector by impulse response functions @xmath4 . if the photon flux at detector @xmath5 is @xmath6 , the electronic output can be defined as    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the electronic noise of the photodiodes , including amplification . here , @xmath9 stands for the convolution of @xmath10 and @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath12 . for clarity , the time dependence will be suppressed when possible .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the following notation : @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 . using these new variables ,",
    "eq . takes the form    @xmath17    from this signal , we are interested in recovering the differential photon number @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the time interval of the desired pulse , with minimal uncertainty .",
    "more precisely , we want to find an estimator @xmath20 $ ] , that is unbiased @xmath21 , and has minimal variance @xmath22 .",
    "in order to make @xmath23 unbiased , we realize that it must linearly depend on @xmath24 .",
    "this because @xmath25 and @xmath24 are linear in both @xmath26 and @xmath27",
    ". therefore , the estimator must have the form @xmath28    in eq .",
    ", @xmath29 refers to as _ pattern function _ , which describes the most general linear estimator .",
    "in this work , we will consider three cases : 1 ) a raw estimator , @xmath30 for @xmath31 and 0 otherwise ; 2 ) a wiener estimator , which makes use of a wiener - filter - like pattern function , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 represents the wiener filter in the time domain @xcite , and 3 ) a model - based pattern function estimator @xmath34 .",
    "notice that both @xmath33 and @xmath35 are defined in @xmath36 , allowing to properly choose a desired pulse . in",
    "what follows , we explicitly show how to calculate the model - based pattern function estimator @xmath35 .",
    "we assume that @xmath37 have known averages ( over many pulses ) @xmath38 , and similarly the response functions @xmath39 have averages @xmath40 .",
    "then the average of the electronic output reads as @xmath41 and @xmath42 . in writing eq .",
    ", we have assumed that the noise sources are uncorrelated .    from this",
    "we observe that if a balanced optical signal is introduced , i.e. @xmath43 , the mean electronic signal @xmath44 is entirely due to @xmath45 . in order",
    "that @xmath23 correctly detects this null signal , @xmath35 must be orthogonal to @xmath45 , i.e.    @xmath46    our second condition derives from @xmath47 which is in effect a calibration condition : the right - hand side is a uniform - weight integral of @xmath48 , while the left - hand side is a non - uniform - weight integral , giving preference to some parts of the signal .",
    "if the total weights are the same , the above gives @xmath49 .",
    "we note that this condition is not very restrictive .",
    "for example , given @xmath50 , and given @xmath35 up to a normalization , the equation simply specifies the normalization of @xmath35 .",
    "notice that the condition given by eq . may still be somewhat ambiguous .",
    "if we want this to apply for all possible shapes @xmath51 , it would imply @xmath52 const .",
    ", and would make the whole exercise trivial .",
    "instead , we make the physically reasonably assumption that the input pulse , with shape @xmath53 is uniformly rotated to give @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "similarly , it follows that @xmath56 .",
    "we note that this assumption is not strictly obeyed in our experiment and is a matter of mathematical convenience : a path difference from the pbs to the two detectors will introduce an arrival - time difference giving rise to opposite - polarity features at the start and end of the pulse , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : restech](a ) . a delay in the corresponding response functions",
    "@xmath10 is , however , equivalent , and we opt to absorb all path delays into the response functions . in our experiment",
    "the path difference is @xmath57 , implying a time difference of less than 0.2  ns , much below the smallest features in fig .",
    "[ fig : restech](a ) . absorbing the constant of proportionality into @xmath35",
    ", we find    @xmath58    which is our calibration condition .",
    "we consider two kinds of technical noise : fluctuating detector response and fluctuating input pulses .",
    "we write the response functions in the form @xmath59 , for a given detector @xmath5 , where the fluctuating term @xmath60 is a stochastic variable .",
    "similarly , we write @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is @xmath63 or @xmath64 . by substituting the corresponding fluctuating response functions into eq . , the electronic output signal becomes    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the summed technical noise from both @xmath67 and @xmath68 sources .",
    "we note that the optical technical noise , in contrast to optical quantum noise , scales as @xmath69 , so that @xmath70 . in passing to the last line we neglect terms @xmath71 on the assumption @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "we further assume that @xmath74 and @xmath75 are uncorrelated .",
    "we find the variance of the model - based estimator , @xmath76 , is @xmath77 with the first term describing technical noise , and the second one electronic noise .    to compare against noise measurements , we transform eq . to the frequency domain .",
    "using parseval s theorem , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : simp1mwm ] ) , we can write the noise power as    @xmath78    our goal is now to find the @xmath79 that minimizes @xmath80 satisfying the conditions in eqs . and , which in the frequency space are    @xmath81    @xmath82    the specific form of the solution is given in appendix [ sec : pattesolution ] .",
    "at 150  mhz ( blue dashed line ) and the amplified one @xmath83 at 5  mhz ( green solid line ) . for the sake of comparison ,",
    "both pulses are normalized.,width=226 ]    [ cols=\"^ \" , ]      to illustrate the performance of our technique when filtering technical noise , we introduce a high amount of noise about @xmath84 db above the shot noise level at the maximum optical power to the light pulses produced by the aoms . after balancing a maximum of 10",
    "db remains in the electronic output , which is then filtered by means of the optimal pattern function technique .",
    "we have verified the correct noise filtering by comparing the results with shot - noise limited pulses .",
    "for this purpose , we compute @xmath85 , the variance of the optimal estimator for each power , and for each data set , the shot - noise limited and the noisy one .",
    "figure [ fig : res3 ] shows the computed noise estimation as function of the optical power for both .",
    "notice that the two noise estimations are linear with the optical power .",
    "moreover , we observe that both curves agree at @xmath86 , using the ratio of the slopes , which allows us to conclude that , by using this technique , we can retrieve shot - noise limited pulses from signals bearing high amount of technical noise .",
    "the experimental setup that we have implemented , see fig .",
    "[ fig : expsetup ] , can perform also as a pulsed signal polarimeter .",
    "for instance , it is possible to determine a small polarization - rotation angle @xmath87 from a @xmath88 linear polarized light pulse . along these lines ,",
    "we make use of three estimators @xmath89 and @xmath90 to determine the amount of noise on the estimation of the polarization - rotation angle . from the obtained results ,",
    "we show that the model - based estimator outperforms the other two .",
    "we proceed to calculate the noise on the polarization - rotation angle @xmath87 estimation , for this determination we calculate the variance of @xmath87 .",
    "we notice that the taylor approximation of the variance of @xmath91 is    @xmath92    for small angles",
    "@xmath87 , the function @xmath91 is approximately linear on @xmath87 , so the contribution from higher order terms can be disregarded .",
    "therefore , the noise on the angle estimation is    @xmath93    we can then compute this expression using the three before mentioned estimators . for such task we use the experimental data together with an analytical approximation of the derivative , that takes as input the measured data .",
    "figure [ fig : resangle ] depicts the noise angle estimation , showing that the optimal pattern function performs better than the other estimators when eliminating the technical noise and reducing the electronic noise .",
    "in particular , the based - model estimator surpasses the wiener estimator , which is a widely used method in signal processing @xcite .",
    "we have studied in theory and with an experimental demonstration , the optimal recovery of light pulses via balanced detection .",
    "we developed a theoretical model for a balanced detector and the noise related to the detection of optical pulses .",
    "we minimized the technical and electronic noise contributions obtaining the optimal ( model - based ) pattern function .",
    "we designed and implemented an experimental setup to test the introduced theoretical model . in this experimental setup , we produced technical noise in a controlled way , and retrieved shot - noise limited signals from signals bearing about 10  db of technical noise after balanced detection .",
    "finally , we compare against nave and wiener filter estimation for measuring rotation angles , and confirm superior performance of the model - based estimator .",
    "the results presented here might lead to a better polarization - rotation angle estimations when using pulses leading to probe magnetic atomic ensembles in environments with technical noise @xcite .",
    "this possibility is especially attractive for balanced detection of sub - shot - noise pulses @xcite , for which the acceptable noise levels are still lower .",
    "we note the inner - product form of parseval s theorem @xmath94 where the functions @xmath95 are the fourier transforms of @xmath96 , respectively . for any stationary random variable @xmath97 , @xmath98",
    "( if this were not the case , there would be a phase relation between different frequency components , which contradicts the assumption of stationarity ) . from this",
    ", it follows that @xmath99",
    "we will minimize the noise power @xmath80 ( see eq . ) with respect to the pattern function @xmath79 using the two conditions ( see eq . and eq . ) .",
    "we solve this by the method of lagrange multipliers .",
    "for this , we write    @xmath100    and then solve the equations    @xmath101    the first equation reads    @xmath102    with formal solution    @xmath103    the second and third equations from eq .",
    "are the same as eq .",
    "and eq . above",
    ". the problem is then reduced to finding @xmath104 , @xmath105 which ( through the above ) , make @xmath79 satisfy the two constraints .    substituting eq . into eq . and",
    "eq . , we find    @xmath106    and @xmath107 where    @xmath108    @xmath109    @xmath110    @xmath111    with @xmath112 . the solution to the set of eqs . and is then given by @xmath113    it should be noted that quantum noise is not explicitly considered in the model .",
    "rather , it is implicitly present in @xmath114 which may differ from their average values @xmath115 due to quantum noise . note that the point of this measurement design is to optimize the measurement of @xmath116 including the quantum noise in that variable .",
    "for this reason , it is sufficient to describe , and minimize , the other contributions .",
