    "one of the astounding principles of quantum mechanics is that a quantum object can exist in a superposition state , _",
    "e.g. _ , a spin in a superposition of up and down states , @xmath0 .",
    "applying this principle to two quantum particles , a superposition state such as a singlet state @xmath1 allows the instantaneous determination of the quantum state of the second particle after one measures the quantum state of the first particle , as revealed by einstein , podolsky and rosen in 1935 @xcite .",
    "this instantaneous determination seems like a violation of a principle of the special relativity , _ i.e. _ , nothing can travel faster than light , leading to the so called epr paradox",
    ". the incompleteness of quantum mechanics and the existence of hidden variables were therefore suspected .    in a seminal paper by bell in 1964 @xcite , an equality was proposed to show that the statistical results of quantum mechanics is incompatible with any local hidden variable theories .",
    "subsequent experiments overwhelmingly support the predictions of quantum mechanics . in particular ,",
    "any local hidden variable theories are excluded by loophole - free experiments in 2015 @xcite .    in the exploration of epr paradox ,",
    "the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) states @xcite play an important role .",
    "it concerns with a three - particle entangled state , @xmath2 , which allows a direct contradiction between the predictions of quantum mechanics and local hidden variable theories with a single test , in contrast to the statistical nature of the bell s inequality .",
    "ghz states have also been found useful in the heisenberg limit metrology @xcite .",
    "mesoscopic ghz states with @xmath3 particles @xmath4 can be generated by using the mlmer - srensen approach @xcite in ion traps , with @xmath3 up to 14 in experiments @xcite . to generate ghz states in a wide range of quantum systems ,",
    "new mechanisms are highly wanted .",
    "here we introduce a  quantum zipper \" to sew ghz states in a systematic way .    ) .",
    "5 , send a @xmath5 pulse to flip the second spin .",
    "6 , send in a @xmath5 pulse to flip the fourth spin . 7 ,",
    "introduce the same interaction as in step 4 among the red spins until achieving the state shown in this step .",
    "8 , send a @xmath5 pulse to flip the third spin . repeat the steps 6 - 8 until zipping all spins in the ghz state , each time adding two spins to the ghz chain . for a ghz state with @xmath6 spins ,",
    "we need in total @xmath7 @xmath5 pulses and one @xmath8 pulse . ]",
    "the basic process for generating ghz states is shown in fig . [",
    "we start with an all - down state and send a @xmath5 pulse to the first spin to flip it up .",
    "then we send a @xmath8 pulse to prepare the second spin in a superposition of the up and down states .",
    "the following step 4 is crucial .",
    "we introduce a special interaction between the first three spins , which undergo opposite chiral spin wave rotations for @xmath9 and @xmath10 states ,    [ eq1 ] |||| , [ ea ] +     the spin states move to the right for the states containing one up spin while they move to the left for the states containing two up spins .",
    "the step 4 corresponds to the rotations @xmath11 and @xmath12 in eq.([eq1 ] ) .",
    "we then send a @xmath5 pulse to the second spin and prepare the first three spins in a ghz state , as shown in the step 5 . following and repeating the steps 6 - 8 ( see fig.[scheme ] caption ) , we can zip the following spins into a ghz state .",
    "in a previous work , we studied chiral photon rotations among three cavities by generating a synthetic magnetic field @xcite . the process in eq.([eq1 ] ) can be realized in a similar way by the following hamiltonian , @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the raising and lowering operators for the @xmath16th spin and the summation over @xmath16 is cyclic .",
    "the hamiltonian in eq.([hspin ] ) commutes with @xmath17 and the number of up spins is conserved .",
    "we first investigate the dynamics in the subspace expanded by @xmath9 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , in which the eigen frequencies are @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the corresponding eigenstates are            the evolution of the initial state @xmath23 is @xmath24.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is clear that at time @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and at time @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "we obtain the chiral spin wave rotation in eq .",
    "( [ eq1]@xmath29 ) .",
    "we can follow the same procedure to calculate the dynamics in the subspace with two up spins , @xmath10 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the spin states move to the left , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq1]@xmath32 ) . to understand this surprising result",
    ", we try to know how @xmath10 evolves based on the knowledge that the state @xmath9 rotates to the right . by reversing our definition of up and down ,",
    "the state @xmath10 becomes @xmath9 in the new basis . to express the hamiltonian in this upside down basis",
    ", we need to make the replacement @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which results in @xmath35 .",
    "the state evolves backward in time , _",
    "i.e. _ , the spin wave moves to the left .",
    "the key feature of the hamiltonian in eq.([hspin ] ) is the imaginary interaction strength between the spins .",
    "previously we proposed the synthetic magnetic field for photons by oscillating the frequencies of three cavities that are coupled to the same spin @xcite . here",
    "we consider three spins with oscillating frequencies coupled to the same cavity mode .",
    "let us first consider two spins with frequencies being modulated with different phases .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian can be written as @xmath36+h.c.,\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the annihilation operator of the cavity , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the modulation amplitude , frequency and phase for the @xmath16th spin .",
    "we assume the central frequencies of the spins are the same as that of the cavity .",
    "since @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the @xmath42th order bessel function of the first kind , we can expand the interaction hamiltonian @xmath43 , where @xmath44 + i^nj_n(-f)\\hbar g [ \\sigma^+_1 e^{in\\phi_1}+\\sigma^+_2 e^{in\\phi_2}]a,\\ ] ] the effective hamiltonian is @xcite , @xmath45\\\\ = h_0+i\\frac{\\hbar g^2}{\\nu_d}\\eta(\\sigma_2^+\\sigma_1 ^ --\\sigma_1^+\\sigma_2 ^ -).\\ ] ] where @xmath46/n$ ] .",
    "when @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , we obtain the imaginary interaction strength between the two spins .",
    "we introduce the third spin with the same modulation amplitude @xmath37 and frequency @xmath38 but a different phase @xmath50 , and we set @xmath51 .",
    "we obtain @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ hspin ] ) with @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    in the experiments ,",
    "the transition frequencies of the spins can be modulated by the dynamic stark shift of a detuned light field with modulated intensities .",
    "the spins can be atoms coupled to a one - dimensional waveguide that can mediate long range interactions between atoms @xcite ."
