    "various cosmological observations , including the type ia supernovae ( sneia ) @xcite , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite and baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) @xcite , etc .",
    ", have revealed that the current expansion of the universe is accelerating and it entered this accelerating phase only in the near past .",
    "a new energy component with negative pressure called dark energy ( de ) is needed to explain this acceleration expansion within the framework of general relativity ( gr ) . the simplest and most appealing candidate for de",
    "is the @xmath3 cold dark matter ( @xmath3cdm ) model , in which the cosmological constant @xmath3 plays a role of de in gr .",
    "this model is in general agreement with current astronomical observations , but has difficulties in reconciling the small observational value of de density to that coming from quantum field theories .",
    "this is called the cosmological constant problem @xcite .",
    "therefore , a number of models for de to explain the current acceleration without the cosmological constant has been proposed , such as quintessence @xcite , phantom @xcite , k - essence @xcite , tachyon @xcite , quintom @xcite ; as well as the chaplygin gas @xcite and the generalized chaplygin gas @xcite , the holographic de @xcite , the new agegraphic de @xcite , the ricci de @xcite , and so on .    one of interesting de models is the polytropic gas which was proposed to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the polytropic gas model in the presence of interaction with dm can behave as phantom type de @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out that a polytropic scalar field can be reconstructed according to the evolutionary behaviors of the holographic @xcite and new agegraphic @xcite de densities .",
    "the validity of the generalized second law of gravitational thermodynamics was examined for the polytropic gas model in @xcite .",
    "different modified gravity models including @xmath4-gravity @xcite and @xmath5-gravity @xcite were reconstructed according to the polytropic gas equation of state .",
    "the polytropic tachyon , k - essence and dilaton scalar field models were studied in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the polytropic gas model was investigated from the viewpoint of statefinder diagnostic tool and @xmath6 analysis .    in the present work",
    ", our main aim is to fit the polytropic gas model and give the constraints on model parameters , with current observational data including sneia , cmb , bao and observational hubble data ( ohd ) , filling in the gap existing in the literature . to do so , in section 2 , we briefly review the polytropic gas model as unified picture of dm and de in a spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe .",
    "in section 3 , we consider the cosmological constraints on the polytropic gas model by using the latest observational data . in section 4 ,",
    "we give numerical results .",
    "section 5 is devoted to conclusions .",
    "for a polytropic gas model , the energy density @xmath7 and pressure @xmath8 satisfy the equation of state ( eos ) @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 and the polytropic index @xmath11 are two constants of the model .    here , we consider a spatially flat frw universe containing only the polytropic fluid and baryonic matter .",
    "we ignore the contribution of radiation , as expected from the observations @xcite . in the framework of the standard frw cosmology ,",
    "the first friedmann equation reads @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the hubble parameter .",
    "also @xmath7 and @xmath14 denote the energy densities of the polytropic and pressureless baryonic matter ( @xmath15 ) , respectively , which satisfy the following energy conservation laws @xmath16 @xmath17 using the dimensionless density parameters @xmath18 the friedmann equation ( [ feq ] ) is rewritten as follows @xmath19 substituting eq .",
    "( [ eospol ] ) into ( [ feq ] ) gives the evolution of the polytropic gas energy density in terms of redshift @xmath20 as @xmath21^{-n},\\ ] ] where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the polytropic energy density at present time .",
    "( [ eeqbm ] ) gives @xmath24 it is worth to note that the polytropic gas energy density ( [ rhopol ] ) offers a unified picture of dm and de . because it smoothly interpolates between a non - relativistic matter phase , @xmath25 , in the past and a negative - pressure de regime , @xmath26 , at late time ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "therefore , within the framework of unified dm - de ( udme ) scenario one can rewrite the polytropic gas energy density as @xmath28 where the dm is a pressureless matter ( @xmath29 ) . using eqs .",
    "( [ eospol ] ) and ( [ rhopol ] ) one can obtain the eos parameter @xmath30 of the polytropic gas model as @xmath31 with the help of eqs .",
