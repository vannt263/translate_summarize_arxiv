    "rotating radio transients ( rrats from herein ) were discovered in a search of archival data from the parkes multi - beam pulsar survey ( pmps from herein ) by  @xcite .",
    "these sources exhibit infrequent , short , relatively bright bursts of radio emission .",
    "the pulses have peak flux densities ( at 1.4 ghz ) ranging from @xmath0 mjy up to @xmath1 jy and pulse widths in the range @xmath2 ms .",
    "as we detect pulses only occasionally from rrats they are generally not detected in fourier domain searches ( although see discussion in section 3 ) but rather by searching for individual bright pulses  @xcite .",
    "periodicities can be determined by factorising the difference between each pair of pulse arrival times ( as discussed in section 2 ) .",
    "the underlying periodicities are in the range @xmath3 s. these periodicities are believed to be spin periods and thus rrats seem to be a new population of neutron stars .",
    "further evidence for this comes from x - ray observations of rrat j1819@xmath41458 ( the most prolific , brightest and thus well studied source ) which have revealed thermal emission consistent with that expected from cooling neutron stars as well as an x - ray period identical to that determined from radio observations  @xcite .",
    "we see these millisecond bursts as infrequently as once per hour and up to as often as every few minutes .",
    "the long periods observed are more comparable to the magnetars  @xcite and the isolated neutron stars ( inss , aka xdinss ,  @xcite ) , than the radio pulsars and the relationship between these populations is an open question .",
    "the narrow pulse widths are comparable to individual pulses from radio pulsars . coupled to their longer periods",
    "the duty cycles are apparently much smaller , but including the entire phase range wherein we see emission gives duty cycles comparable to integrated pulsar profiles , e.g j1819@xmath41458 shows emission over @xmath5 phase range  @xcite .",
    "there have been many suggested explanations for the ` bursty ' rrat behaviour .",
    "some assign it to detection issues with others favouring intrinsically transient emission .",
    "@xcite support the former notion and suggest that the rrat emission may be due to these sources being more - distant analogues of psr b0656@xmath414 , i.e. pulsars whose regular emission may be below our detection limit but who show detectable giant pulses or have an amplitude distribution with a long tail at high flux densities .",
    "the alternative models view the emission as truly intermittent with the short duration bursts corresponding to activation times of external excitation events .",
    "this is the case in the model of cordes and shannon ( 2006 ) which considers the re - activation of inactive vacuum gaps due to the presence of circum - stellar asteroidal material .",
    "similarly it has been proposed by  @xcite that rrats may be surrounded by a radiation belt which could stimulate transient emission in the magnetosphere .",
    "behaviour of rrat apart from these unusual emission properties rrats are also of interest due to the predicted size of the population , which is thought to be several times larger than the radio pulsar population  @xcite .",
    "previously  @xcite discussed the implications of such a large number of rrats on the galactic production rate of neutron stars .",
    "it was argued that the many classes of neutron stars now known do not seem to be accounted for by the galactic core - collapse supernova rate .",
    "an evolutionary link between the neutron star classes might eliminate this birthrate problem .",
    "an alternative explanation would be that the population estimates for rrats and other neutron star populations are hugely over - estimated .",
    "the discovery of rrats has sparked a renewed interest in time - domain searches for transient radio sources - a relatively unexplored parameter space  @xcite which will be revolutionised with upcoming instruments such as lofar  @xcite , the ata  ( e.g.  van leeuwen et al .  2009 ) , the ska pathfinders  ( e.g.  johnston et al .",
    "2009 ) , fast  @xcite and eventually the ska  @xcite .",
    "for now , addressing these questions requires improved population estimates and characterisation .",
    "in particular , we need to understand which potential selection effects are present during the discovery process and how they impact on the discovered population . with a better understanding of rrat characteristics and the potential selection effects an improved population estimate for rrats",
    "will be possible .",
    "motivated by this we have performed a full re - processing of the pmps searching for sources of single pulses of radio emission . in section 2 below we outline the steps involved in our re - processing . in section 3",
    "we discuss in some detail the observed characteristics of 10 newly discovered sources as well as the results of follow - up work on one detected , but previously known , source .",
    "for the purposes of sections 2 and 3 we will consider that for a source to be a rrat at some frequency that it is necessary but not sufficient that it is detected more easily in a single pulse search than in a periodicity search . in section 4",
    "we discuss in more detail a refined definition of what a rrat is as well as the implications for the galactic neutron star population of these new discoveries before concluding with an outlook towards surveys with lofar and the ska .",
    "in the original rrat discovery paper  @xcite it was estimated that approximately half of the rrats visible in the pmps had been detected , with the remainder obscured due to the effects of radio frequency interference ( rfi ) .",
    "recently it has become timely to re - process the pmps survey in search of these postulated sources as we have developed a new and effective rfi mitigation scheme  @xcite . utilising the jodrell bank pulsar group",
    "s recently acquired 1400-processor hydra super - computer , the whole pmps data set was re - processed . modified versions of the _ _ sigproc _ _ processing tools were used . in the following we refer to this project as the pmsingle process .",
    "we note that the presence of rfi will make a search somewhat blind to sources with low dispersion measure ( dm ) .",
    "the dm of a source at a distance @xmath6 from earth is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the electron density at a distance @xmath9 .",
    "rfi is terrestrial in origin and , not having traversed the inter - stellar medium , we expect it to have @xmath10 .",
    "however as rfi signals are typically very strong , in comparison to the relatively weak astrophysical signals of interest , they are seen with sufficient residual intensity to mask celestial signals to high dm values .",
    "figure  [ fig : lowdm_blindness ] shows an example of this ` low - dm blindness ' due to the presence of strong terrestrial rfi .",
    "this of course means that searches can miss real , low - dm sources .",
    "thus our sensitivity to the nearby galactic volume may have been reduced due to the effects of rfi in the initial analysis .",
    "[ fig : lowdm_blindness ]    before proceeding with outlining the pmsingle re - processing steps we note some survey and data specifications : the survey covered a strip along the galactic plane with @xmath11 and between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "it consists of @xmath14-minute pointings at an observation frequency of 1.4  ghz using the parkes 21-cm multi - beam receiver .",
    "this receiver has 13 beams which each receive orthogonal linear polarisation so that there are @xmath15 dual - polarisation beams in total .",
    "an analogue filterbank with @xmath16 mhz channels was used with 250-@xmath17s sampling .",
    "once the data were received both polarisation signals were added to give total intensity ( stokes i ) and the data were 1-bit digitised before recording .",
    "thus the raw data for each beam can be visualised as a 1-bit digitised data cube ( time , frequency and amplitude ) .",
    "the survey specifics are described in more detail in  @xcite .",
    "our pmsingle processing involved the following steps :    1 .",
    "_ remove all clipping algorithms .",
    "_ in previous analyses of the pmps the raw data have been ` clipped ' , i.e.  the data were read in 48 kb blocks and those blocks wherein the sum of all the bit values was larger than some ( user supplied ) threshold above the mean had their values set to the mean level ( half 1s and half 0s in the case of 1-bit data ) .",
    "the motivation for such clipping is that rfi signals are typically much stronger than real astrophysical signals , so that the brightest detections are taken to be rfi spikes .",
    "this , however , is not optimal in that it removes signals based on strength and the discovery of rrats and pulsars which show strong single pulses show that such signals may be of astrophysical interest .",
    "the threshold used is also arbitrary and usually determined on a trial - and - error basis .",
    "we note that the strongest pulses with high dispersion ( i.e. dispersed over 2 or more blocks ) can escape being clipped in error so that low - dm sources are the most likely to be clipped in this way .",
    "we therefore removed this step from our re - processing .",
    "2 .   _ dedisperse the raw filterbank data using the zero - dm filter .",
    "_ we searched for dispersed signals in a dm range of @xmath18 @xmath19 .",
    "for the galactic longitudes covered by the pmps this corresponds , at @xmath20 , to typical distances of @xmath21 kpc at @xmath12 and @xmath13 to @xmath22 kpc towards the galactic centre . the zero - dm filtering technique can be simply stated : for each time sample @xmath23 we average all @xmath24 frequency channels and subtract this average from each channel .",
    "the value of a frequency channel @xmath25 at time @xmath23 is @xmath26 and after applying the zero - dm filter function will become : @xmath27 this has the effect of removing short - duration broadband rfi but real dispersed pulses will be convolved with a particular function . after applying this filter",
    "we dedisperse the data .",
    "a dispersed input square pulse @xmath28dm@xmath29 at time @xmath30 , with pulse width @xmath31 , observed with a bandwidth @xmath32 at a central frequency @xmath33 will become : @xmath34 the peak of the pulse is reduced with the addition of triangular ` dips ' either side of the pulse with the exact shape dependent on the pulse s dm and width , as well as on @xmath35 and @xmath32 .",
    "examples of this are given in figure  [ fig : zdm ] which shows single pulses detected from j1841@xmath414 .",
    "we note that the zero - dm filter acts as a more natural rfi mitigation tool than standard clipping as it removes signals based on their dispersion properties as opposed to sheer strength .",
    "details of the zero - dm filter including assumptions , uses and limitations are discussed in detail in  @xcite .",
    "search for bright single pulses .",
    "_ this is an excercise in matched filtering using box - cars of various sizes .",
    "however , instead of rectangular box - cars the zero - dm filtering means it is optimal to search with box - cars of the form @xmath36 for various trial widths . that this is the optimal strategy is evident from examining the pulse in figure  [ fig : zdm ] which clearly shows the characteristic dips from the zero - dm filtering procedure . in pmsingle",
    "we search for pulse widths as narrow as 250 @xmath37s to as wide as 128 ms at the lowest dms .",
    "as we increase the dm trial value we get dispersive smearing of pulses to widths much longer than their intrinsic widths so at these dms we search for even wider pulses .",
    "the widest pulse widths searched for are a factor of 16 larger than in the original pmps single - pulse search analysis of  @xcite .",
    "_ perform a beam comparison to remove multi - beam events .",
    "_ the zero - dm filtering is effective at removing short - duration broad - band rfi .",
    "the more persistant or narrow - band that rfi is the less likely it will be completely removed .",
    "however as the pmps used a 13-beam receiver we have extra information to help with rfi mitigation .",
    "pulsar signals are very weak and typically are seen in only one beam .",
    "the strongest pulsars ( e.g.  vela ) can be seen in a few beams but normally no more than three .",
    "even the extremely bright 30-jy 5-ms single burst ( from an unknown source possibly at a cosmological distance ) reported by  @xcite , was seen in just three beams .",
    "we can thus apply a rejection criteria for detected events like : for each detected event - @xmath38 point , if we have detections in the range @xmath39 for , e.g. @xmath40 , beams in that pointing then ignore this detection as it is most likely rfi .",
    "we conservatively took @xmath41 to be one bin in each case ( i.e. one dm trial step and one time sample step ) .",
    "in addition , for all beams , a check is made against the known pulsars ( from the atnf pulsar database ,  @xcite ) which fall within the beam . 5 .   _ produce diagnostic plots for inspection and classification .",
    "_ along the lines of  @xcite a series of diagnostic plots are created for each beam .",
    "an example of this is shown in figure  [ fig : search_plots ] .",
    "the plots include beam information ( beam and pointing number , sky position etc . ) as well as information on the number of multiple beam detections which were removed .",
    "each beam was inspected and classified as containing either noise , known pulsars , known rrats or new candidates - divided into classes 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "examples of each of these classes are given in figure  [ fig : cand_classes ] .",
    "class 1 candidates are all thought to be real sources , either yet - to - be confirmed rrats or known pulsars detected in the telescope s far - side - lobes . class 3 candidates are weak and no confirmations are expected .",
    "class 2 sources are intermediate between these classes .",
    "beams could also be classified as being too adversely affected with remnant rfi ( not removed by zero - dm filtering or beam comparisons ) so as to make inspection impossible . in these beams a real source , unless it were very strong , would not have been detectable .",
    "the results of the classifications are given in table  [ tab : pmsingle_classifications ] .",
    "+      + .the classifications of the pmps beams in the pmsingle single - pulse search . for",
    "the known sources the number of unique sources detected are given in parentheses .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : lognormal_fit ]      we note that the scope of any definition can and should be wary of those radio pulsars which are sufficiently weak and/or distant not to be detected by periodicity searches . such sources are automatically accounted for by the predicted galactic pulsar population .",
    "for instance there are estimated to be @xmath42 radio pulsars in our galaxy with a radio luminosity @xmath43 @xmath44  @xcite , or @xmath45 with @xmath46 @xmath44  @xcite .",
    "these estimates are arrived at from accounting for known observational selection effects of surveys and extrapolating from the observed properties of pulsars ( e.g. the observed luminosity distribution and empirical beaming models ) .",
    "however we note that if the population of rrats is indeed a factor of a few times larger than that of the radio pulsars not all rrats can be accounted for as weak and/or distant pulsars . with the addition of these 11 new pmps",
    "rrat sources there are now 22 confirmed rrat sources in the survey .",
    "there are a further 6 single pulse sources in the literature recently reported by  @xcite ( although some of these are detectable in fft searches also ) and one source discovered in the gbt350 survey  @xcite .",
    "of these 29 currently known sources 27 have determined periods and seven ( of the original 11 ) sources now have known period derivatives  @xcite . the initial rrat population estimate suggested that there were @xmath47 times as many rrats as pulsars  @xcite . we defer a complete population analysis until we have investigated all of our best candidates but we can already comment on some of the selection effects impacting upon this estimate .",
    "these include the rrat beaming fraction , their observed on - off fraction and the fraction missed due to contaminating rfi :",
    "( a ) with no reliable information on a beaming model for rrats , we continue to use the empirical pulsar beaming model , @xmath48 ^ 2 + 0.03 $ ] , of  @xcite .",
    "still , it remains to be seen what the actual rrat beaming model might be or whether this beaming model even still applies for pulsars with long periods .",
    "the latter is highlighted by the recent discovery of a slow pulsar with an extremely narrow pulse by keith et al .",
    "if beaming fractions were in fact overestimated , the projected populations of both pulsars and rrats may be much larger .",
    "( b ) the assumed averaged on - off fraction during a pmps observation was taken to be 1/2 , i.e. half of the rrats that exist were assumed not to emit pulses during the 35  min observation which was consistent with the observed burst rates at the time . with",
    "the discovery and continued monitoring of a growing population of known rrats it will be possible to determine the true burst rate distribution and thus to improve this value in population estimates .",
    "( c ) the factor used to compensate for those sources missed due to the presence of rfi was quite uncertain and taken to be 0.5 .",
    "taking into consideration the pointings with strong residual rfi and the fraction of sources removed by zero - dm in the light of the pmsingle analysis the number of beams still affected by rfi is @xmath49 which is @xmath50 of all beams , so that 97% are now cleaned of rfi .",
    "we have doubled the number of known rrats while simultaneously reducing the fraction missed by rfi to almost zero .",
    "the inferred population estimate is thus related to the initial estimate by a factor of @xmath51 so that the confirmed number of new sources is consistent with the original population estimate  @xcite . however , if even a small fraction of the large number of other candidates are confirmed as new rrats , the initial population estimate will need to be revised upwards so that the number of transient radio emitting neutron stars in the galaxy is even larger than initially thought .",
    "of course with the continued monitoring and thus characterisation of more sources we can also improve our knowledge of the other selection effects .    assuming the population of rrats is indeed much larger than that of the normal radio pulsars , the neutron star birthrate problem remains .",
    "in addition to pulsars and rrats there are the inss , magnetars , neutron stars in accreting binary systems and the central compact objects ( of which some are thought to be neutron stars , e.g. see  @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggest that more than 30 new ins sources need to be discovered before unfavourable beaming can be ruled out , i.e. that these sources are pulsars and/or rrats whose beams do not cross our line of sight .",
    "recently several tens of new ins candidates have been identified  @xcite so that progress may come in this area despite the difficulty in finding such sources  @xcite . besides pulsars many",
    "more sources are needed for the other classes to reach a conclusive answer as to the links ( if any ) between these populations .",
    "we have presented an overview of the steps involved in performing searches for sources showing single pulses of radio emission .",
    "these have enabled us to discover 11 new pmps sources from which between 2 and 231 pulses have been detected .",
    "underlying periodicities for these sources lie in the range of 125  ms up to 6.6  s. these join the original 11 rrat sources identified previously in the survey .",
    "we have reduced the uncertainties with regard to the number of sources missed due to the contaminating effects of rfi .",
    "the projected population of these sources still appears to be larger than the regular radio pulsars .",
    "however we are yet to determine the burst rate and beaming distributions for the rrats - key ingredients in a complete population synthesis .",
    "these characteristics will be determined with continued monitoring of the new sources and followup investigations of the other promising candidates ( of which there are now more than 100 ) .",
    "it seems also that there will be many candidates for whom it will be impractical or impossible to follow up at present with current observing facilities .",
    "these will require followup with instruments like lofar , fast or the ska .",
    "we note that these these instruments will produce extraordinarily large volumes of data so that searching for transient rrat - like sources will necessitate the development of automated algorithms which will use the steps as outlined above .",
    "we would like to thank the anonymous referees for providing helpful comments which have improved the quality of this work .",
