    "continuous variable ( cv ) quantum information has been developed with gaussian states and operations , which allow the realization fundamental protocols as teleportation , cloning and dense coding , and still play a relevant role in cv quantum information processing .",
    "recently , also the non gaussian ( ng ) sector of the hilbert space is receiving attention for the potential application in entanglement distillation and entanglement swapping for long distance quantum communication . in turn , using ng states and operations , teleportation @xcite and cloning @xcite of quantum states may be improved . in order to quantify the amount of ng of a state measures have been recently proposed , based on _ distances _ between the quantum state under investigation and a reference gaussian state @xcite .",
    "gaussian states are generated using linear and bilinear interaction in optical materials , whereas the generation of ng states requires higher nonlinearities as those exhibited by a kerr medium .",
    "an alternative approach is to exploit the effective nonlinearity induced by conditional measurements .",

    "the the rate of success in getting a certain state is equal to the probability of obtaining a certain outcome and may be higher than nonlinear efficiency , thus making conditional schemes possibly convenient even when a corresponding hamiltonian process exists .",
    "in this paper we focus on preparation schemes feasible with current technology and address generation of non - gaussian states of light by conditional intensity measurements on the twin - beam state ( twb ) generated by parametric down - conversion and on classically correlated states generated by mixing a thermal beam with the vacuum in a beam splitter ( bs ) . in particular we consider different kinds of conditional measurements : ideal photodetection , inconclusive photodetection and photodetection performed with a finite quantum efficiency @xmath0 and no dark counts .",
