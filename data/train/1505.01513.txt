    "the efficient dissipative generation of entanglement has been theoretically predicted and experimentally demonstrated for qubits in optical cavities @xcite and photonic crystal systems @xcite . in particular , it was reported @xcite that dissipative preparation of entanglement between qubits in high - finesse optical cavities offers significant advantages for fidelity improvement over the protocols based on unitary dynamics ; decreasing the error by an order of magnitude requires only an order of magnitude increase of the cavity finesse in the former case , compared to a two order of magnitude increase of the finesse required in the latter case .",
    "preparation of entangled states with fidelity ( with respect to the bell state @xmath1 ) exceeding 91.9@xmath2 was experimentally demonstrated @xcite .",
    "though offering strong potential for creating highly - entangled states , the small size of optical cavities is a disadvantage when it comes to transferring quantum states over long distances , which is important for applications in quantum communications . for long distance entanglement , coupling of the qubits to reservoirs supporting propagating photonic modes , such as photonic crystals ,",

    "in particularly , efficient transfer of entanglement between two quantum dots ( qds ) placed inside a photonic crystal over a distance 100 times the wavelength of vacuum radiation has been theoretically predicted @xcite .    despite the success of using all - dielectric photonic reservoirs for preparation and transfer of entanglement , the large size of such structures is a drawback for their use in nanophotonic integrated circuits . in order to overcome this difficulty ,",

    "we consider two quantum emitters ( modeled as two - level systems ) placed above 3d waveguides .",
    "since there are a multitude of possible plasmonic waveguide geometries that one can envision , here we restrict our consideration to two waveguides that have been extensively studied in the literature , i.e. a metal nanowire and a v - shaped channel cut in a flat metal plane ( see fig .",

    "we demonstrate that proper positioning of the emitters with respect to the waveguide edges can lead to a significant increase in entanglement compared to the case of the emitter coupled to an infinite plasmonic waveguide . moreover ,",
    "even for the infinite - length case , discontinuities in the waveguides do not always play a detrimental role ; an increase in entanglement compared to the unperturbed case can be achieved by introducing coupling slots into the structure ( which aid in qubit - waveguide coupling ) . in the following we demonstrate the effect of coupling slots for both finite - length and infinite - length waveguides .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : theory ] we present the theory describing dissipation - induced entanglement between two emitters coupled to a plasmonic waveguide .",

    "in this section we introduce two concepts that are crucial for the theoretical description of the evolution of quantum systems coupled to lossy environments , namely , the dyadic green function @xcite and the quantum master equation @xcite .",
    "we use these concepts in order to describe behavior of two identical two - level emitters ( qubits ) placed above 3d plasmonic waveguides ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for the waveguide geometries ) .      even though the process of spontaneous decay is essentially non - classical , and thus requires a full quantum description , the media the emitter",
    "is coupled to can be rigorously incorporated into the quantum formalism through a classical quantity known as the dyadic green function @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the electric field green function is a 3-by-3 dyadic , each column of the dyadic being the electric field produced by a classic electric dipole polarized along the corresponding coordinate system axis .",
    "the green dyadic satisfies @xmath4 where @xmath5 are the observation and source point vectors , respectively , @xmath6 is the vacuum wavenumber , @xmath7 is angular frequency , @xmath8 is the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath9 is relative permittivity , and @xmath10 is the unit 3-by-3 dyadic . the solution of can be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the free - space green dyadic ( i.e. the solution of assuming @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 is the dyadic product , and @xmath15 is the `` scattered '' green function , which is the homogeneous solution of , accounting for the electric field scattered by the media .",
    "it should be noted that although the real part of @xmath16 is singular when @xmath17 , the imaginary part is finite , with @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "in contrast to the free - space green dyadic , the scattered green dyadic @xmath15 does not have any singularities .",
    "however , it depends both on the geometry and permittivity of objects filling the space , and thus does not have a closed analytic form in the general case . in order to calculate the green dyadic @xmath20 for the metallic plasmonic waveguides presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we numerically solved maxwell equations using a commercial finite - difference time - domain method ( fdtd ) from lumerical solutions @xcite .",
    "the importance of the classical green function is that it leads to the dissipative decay rate and coherent coupling terms @xmath21 here @xmath22 is the emitter transition dipole moment , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the decay rates of the emitter @xmath25 due to its interaction with the reservoir ( which includes the plasmonic system ) , and plasmon mediated interactions with the emitter @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "when the emitter itself is in a lossless region of space ( such as the space above the waveguide)@xmath27 does not have any singularity and thus the decay rate is always finite . the emitters transition frequency shift induced by dipole - dipole coupling",
    "is given by @xmath28 .",
    "we assume that the emitter transition frequency @xmath29 already accounts for the photonic lamb shift which is defined by @xmath30 .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that for an infinite waveguide the best entanglement was obtained when @xmath31 was large and @xmath32 was small ( forming the dissipative regime ) .",
    "for the finite waveguide case this classification does not hold exactly , which is discussed below ( e.g. , see fig .",
    "[ fig2_2 ] ) .    in the following we consider two identical emitters located near one of the plasmonic waveguides shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and assume that the waveguide material is silver , which ia relatively low loss metal .",
    "we choose the dipole transition frequency of the emitters to be @xmath33 thz ( emission wavelength @xmath34 nm ) .",
    "the relative permittivity of silver at the dipole transition frequency is @xmath35 @xcite , and we fully account for the dispersive properties of the metal . for the nanowire waveguide",
    "we choose the radius to be @xmath36 nm , such that the surface plasmon wavelength in the nanowire is @xmath37 nm , and the propagation length is @xmath38 , calculated analytically @xcite . for the groove waveguide ,",
    "the depth of the groove is @xmath39 nm and its opening angle is @xmath40 ; these dimensions were chosen in @xcite to yield almost identical plasmonic wavelengths and propagation lengths for the rod and groove structures ( for the groove @xmath41 nm and @xmath38 ) , facilitating comparison between the waveguides .",
    "the total emitter decay rate can be expressed as @xmath42 , in terms of the following emitter decay channels : ( a ) free - space radiation , @xmath43 , ( b ) joule losses in the metal , @xmath44 , and ( c ) excitation of surface plasmons , @xmath45 .",
    "since radiative decay is not helpful for long - distance entanglement , and ohmic decay is obviously deleterious , it is clear that we want to maximize the plasmon decay channel , which enhances qubit - qubit interaction .",
    "this requires careful positioning of the emitter above the nanowire surface ; if the emitter is too close to the nanowire surface , joule losses dominate the emitter decay ( quenching ) . on the other hand , if the emitter is too far away than it mostly radiates into free space .",
    "this problem was studied in @xcite where it was demonstrated that at @xmath46 nm the optimum distance between the surface of an @xmath47 nm infinitely - long silver nanowire and a tuned emitter is 20 nm ( which maximizes @xmath45 ) , with dipole moment perpendicular to the wire , and for the groove structure the optimum emitter height is 12 nm above the surface of the metal , positioned over the central line of the groove and polarized horizontally .",
    "for the finite nanowire the problem is more complicated and a unique definition of @xmath45 is difficult ( since plasmons reflect and refract from the nanowire edges ) .",
    "we expect that the optimum distance should not be considerably different from the infinite - nanowire case , and we here choose the separation between the emitter and waveguide to be the same as the optimum height for the infinite structure , 20 nm for the nanowire and 12 nm for the groove .",
    "although not shown here , slight improvement in entanglement can be obtained by adjusting the qubit height by a few nm .     and decay rate @xmath48 as a function of distance between emitters above an infinite - length silver nanowire with and without coupling slots ( based on scattered green function ) .",
    "the position of one emitter is fixed at @xmath49 and the second emitter position is changing with @xmath50 . slot are located at @xmath51 nm and @xmath52 nm @xmath53 677.5 nm.,width=480 ]    although a primary aim of this work is to examine the effect of a finite plasmonic waveguide structure on entanglement , we first show that introducing discontinuities on an infinite waveguide can enhance qubit - waveguide coupling ( i.e. , in the following we refer to these discontinuities as coupling slots ) , thereby enhancing entanglement .",
    "figure [ fig2_1 ] shows @xmath54 and @xmath55 for emitters placed above an infinite - length nanowire , where @xmath50 indicates the lateral separation between emitters .",
    "one emitter is located at @xmath49 , and the position of the other emitter varies from @xmath49 to @xmath56 nm . note that here , and in fig .",
    "[ fig2_2 ] below , we plot the rates based on the scattered green function ; this term is dominate over the vacuum green function for all cases of interest ( otherwise the plasmonic system would not affect the qubits much , such as , e.g. , if the height of the qubits was increased considerably ) , and it avoids the singularity in @xmath57 associated with the vacuum lamb shift .",
    "however , in computing entanglement we use the full ( scattered plus vacuum ) green function .",
    "oscillatory behavior of @xmath58 and @xmath59 as a function of qubit separation distance is evident in fig .",
    "[ fig2_1 ] , with the period of oscillation being approximately equal to the plasmon wavelength . moreover , the positions of the @xmath60 maxima correspond to positions of @xmath59 minima .",
    "thus coherent and dissipative regimes become dominant at different separations between emitters @xcite . for the case of a nanowire with coupling slots ,",
    "the slots are fixed at @xmath51 nm and @xmath52 nm@xmath53677.5 nm ( one slot is to the right of the right emitter , and the other to the left of the left emitter ; @xmath50 refers to emitter - emitter separation ) .",
    "coupling slots can lead to enhancement of entanglement between the emitters by increasing the dissipative decay rate at the emitter positions , as shown in the figure ( for the effect of coupling slots on entanglement , see fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] below ) . by adding judiciously - chosen coupling slots to the infinitely long nanowire we are increasing emitter - waveguide coupling , similar to the improved field - plasmon coupling in the case of a grating , and thereby increasing emitter decay rates @xmath61 and @xmath48 into the plasmon channel .",
    "it should be noted that coupling slots seem to affect only the dissipative regime , as the slot induced modification of the coherent exchange rate seems to be insignificant ( fig . [",
    "fig2_1]a ) .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath62 is the decay rate of the emitter in free - space .",
    "it should be noted that the ratios @xmath54 and @xmath55 do not depend on the emitter dipole moment @xmath22 , since we are in the weak coupling regime .",
    "it is likely that further improvement in emitter - plasmon coupling ( and , subsequently , entanglement ) can be made by optimizing the slot geometry .",
    "in fact , qubit entanglement depends on many parameters even if the dipole transition frequency and nanowire diameter are fixed . in the case of an infinitely - long nanowire",
    "these parameters are the distance between emitters and the nanowire surface , separation between emitters , and position and geometry of the coupling slots . in the case of a finite - length nanowire",
    "we also have to consider the nanowire length , and positions of the emitters and coupling slots relative to the nanowire ends . in theory , optimal values of these parameters could be found though multi - variable optimization .",
    "however , in this work we make no attempt to find optimal values ; we merely show that reasonably - positioned qubits and coupling slots can improve entanglement .    .",

    "if coupling slots are present , they are placed 27 nm away from each end of the nanowire ( this location leads to enhanced @xmath58 when qubits are at the nanowire ends ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of the electric field intensity of the plasmon mode is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2_2]a . in order to calculate this distribution",
    "we assume a classical electric dipole at the first emitter s position .",

    "figures [ fig2_2](b)-(c ) show the dissipative and coherent rates as a function of emitter - emitter separation for the finite - length nanowire .",
    "we can see that due to plasmon reflections from the nanowire edges , positions of maximums of @xmath59 and @xmath48 almost coincide with each other .",
    "thus we can not clearly separate the dissipative and coherent regimes in the emitter dynamics anymore , unlike for the infinite - waveguide case . for emitters positioned over",

    "moreover , in this case we observe a shift in the position of the maximums of the emitter coupling rates ( which does not occur for the infinite - length structure ) , as the slots change the effective length of the nanowire .",

    "three different coherent pumps differing in the relative phase of the laser field on qubit 1 and 2 have been considered : symmetric pumping indicates identical rabi frequencies , @xmath136 , antisymmetric pumping corresponds to @xmath137 and asymmetric pumping means @xmath138 .    from fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , it is clear that the transient portion of the concurrence is intensity independent , and that the infinite groove has a higher transient peak compared to the infinite nanowire for all pumping regimes .",
    "numerical experimentation shows that larger values of @xmath139 and @xmath60 at the positions of the qubits lead to larger transient concurrence peaks . for",
    "the geometries studied , these mutual rates are larger for the infinite groove than for the infinite nanowire , which facilitates photon exchange between the qubits for the groove guide .",
    "we can also see that the main advantage of a finite waveguide relative to an infinite one is significant improvement in the transient concurrence peak , with more modest improvement in the final , steady - state value .",
    ", as function of qubit separation normalized by the modal wavelength , @xmath140 .",
    "qubits are placed either above a finite nanowire ( right ) or a finite groove ( left ) .",

    "numerical experimentation indicates that for steady state concurrence the preferred case is when we have large @xmath60 and small @xmath139 , in agreement with @xcite for the case of infinite waveguides .",
    "therefore , the dissipative regime leads to larger transient entanglement peaks for infinite - length waveguides , and larger values of @xmath141 in general , and it is only for transient entanglement on finite - length waveguides that the dissipative and coherent regimes becomes similar . here , we can have steady state concurrence close to the peak of the transient value for relatively weak pumping .",
    "for steady state concurrence , large @xmath139 and @xmath60 are less ideal , because of the tendency to decrease ss concurrence . furthermore",
    ", pump strength can not be too large otherwise the qubits will interact mostly with the pump and become decoupled from each other .",
    "ideally , the pump should be strong enough to keep the system interacting , but small enough for the qubit interaction to dominate the dynamics .",
    "as made clear in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , pumping one qubit strongly ( asymmetric pumping ) is possible , but pumping both qubits strongly ( symmetric or antisymmetric pumping ) reduces concurrence .",
    "population dynamics of the qubits are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] for the case when qubits are separated by @xmath116 and pumped either symmetrically , or only one qubit was pumped , for different intensities .",
    "four density matrix elements are @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath119 , and @xmath118 which are respectively the probability of both qubits to be in ground state , both qubits to be in excited state , the first qubit to be in the ground state and the second to be in the excited state , vice versa .",
    "moreover we have assumed that initial state is a state when @xmath123 .",
    "the qubits dynamics is different for one - field and two - field pumping . for the case of two - field pumping ,",
    "in the steady state we have @xmath144 which is reasonable as we are pumping both systems identically .",
    "we can see that these elements first grow rather fast with the growth of the pump intensity , but then slow down around @xmath145 .",
    "we can also see that the element @xmath143 also grows under the influence of the pump .",
    "but it first grows slower and then starts growing faster around @xmath145 .",
    "therefore , this indicates that under such strong pumping the dynamics of both emitters is mostly defined by external pumps , and not by the qubit - qubit interactions , which is detrimental for entanglement . under the single field illumination the density matrix elements",
    "evolve similarly to the previous case .",
    "however , @xmath146 , because the first qubit that is pumped in this case .",
    "we can see that with the intensity increase all elements grow , however , when the intensity becomes too strong the growth freezes and only @xmath118 grows , indicating that dynamics of first emitter is entirely defined by the pump field , which is also detrimental for entanglement .",

    "transient and steady state entanglement of two qubits mediated by two different types of plasmonic waveguides have been presented .",
    "the dynamics of the qubits has been studied using the formalism of the master equations .",
    "the waveguides , acting as photonic reservoirs , were incorporated into the formalism through the classical dyadic green function , accounting for dissipative and coherent interactions between qubits and the reservoir .",
    "the green dyadic has been calculated numerically .",
    "two different methods have been proposed to improve the entanglement between qubits communicating through excited surface plasmonic waves ; using a finite , resonant - length plasmonic waveguide , and including coupling slots near the sites of the qubits to improve the coupling of the qubits to the plasmonic modes .",
