    "electron tunneling through a thin insulating layer ( a potential barrier ) in a metal - insulator - metal ( mim ) multilayered structure is one of the most fundamental research topics in condensed matter physics .",
    "it also lies at the heart of numerous solid - state devices , such as tunnel diodes , @xcite coulomb blockade thermometers , @xcite josephson junctions , @xcite and memory elements based on magnetic tunnel junctions .",
    "@xcite the functionality of a tunnel device relies heavily on the material properties of the intermediate thin insulating layer .",
    "usually , a weak insulating - like temperature dependence of the zero - bias junction conductance , @xmath5_{v\\,\\rightarrow\\,0}$ ] , as described by the simmons model @xcite is used to ascertain the quality and reliability of the insulating layer .",
    "@xcite in the absence of any pinholes in the insulating layer [ see the schematic diagram depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_1](a ) ] , the simmons model predicts a quadratic temperature dependent @xmath6 law from low temperatures up to room temperature .    in practice ,",
    "a precise control of the material properties of the thin insulating layer during the junction fabrication process is extremely difficult .",
    "often , the junction yield varies sensitively with the oxide layer thickness .",
    "@xcite furthermore , the thickness distribution of the oxide layer may be substantial even for those junctions grown under similar conditions .",
    "@xcite as such , the @xmath3 behavior might differ substantially from the simmons law in certain cases .",
    "@xcite the key reason to explain these large variations in the mim quality can be ascribed to the common formation of junction - barrier interfacial roughness .",
    "@xcite because the electron transmission probability increases exponentially with decreasing barrier width , the presence of any notable interfacial roughness thus can significantly affect the overall junction transport properties .    in an mim junction with marked interfacial roughness as schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig_1](b ) , the sharp points of the closest approaches ( called  hot spots \" hereafter @xcite ) between the two conducting regimes will no doubt play a predominant role in the electron tunneling .",
    "[ we note that a hot spot is a precursor of a fully connected ",
    "pinhole , \" see fig .",
    "[ fig_1](c ) . ]",
    "the current flowing through the hot spots between two large metal grains is theoretically found to depend sensitively not only on the applied bias voltage @xmath7 but also on the thermal voltage @xmath8 across the hot spots , where @xmath9 , with @xmath10 being the boltzmann constant , and @xmath11 being the capacitance of the hot spots .",
    "@xcite ( the plus / minus sign in @xmath8 stresses the fact that @xmath8 can be in the same / opposite direction to @xmath7 . ) owing to the smallness of the hot spot , the magnitude of @xmath11 is tiny and thus @xmath8 is notable .",
    "the resulting effect of the total voltage @xmath12 gives rise to the so - called thermally fluctuation - induced tunneling conduction ( fitc ) process through the junction .",
    "the fitc model predicts unique functional forms for the zero - bias @xmath4 versus @xmath13 dependence [ eq .",
    "( [ fitc_rt ] ) ] as well as finite - bias current - voltage ( @xmath14-@xmath15 ) characteristics [ eq .  ( [ fitc_iv ] ) ] over a wide range of @xmath13 from liquid - helium temperatures to room temperature .",
    "while this phenomenological fitc model has reasonably well described the @xmath3 behavior and @xmath14-@xmath15 curves in a good number of experiments , such as nanowire contacts , @xcite the extracted barrier height is often too small ( e.g. , @xmath16 few mev ) and barrier width too large ( e.g. , @xmath17 few tens nm ) . in order to resolve this puzzle ,",
    "xie and sheng have recently retreated this problem by microscopically calculating the electronic wave transmission through atomic - scale fine structures ( short  nanoconstrictions \" ) connecting two large metallic grains .",
    "@xcite in particular , the relevant conduction channels they theoretically considered are those with a transverse dimension slightly smaller than the half of the fermi wavelength of the tunneling electron . by employing the landauer formula , they obtained the @xmath3 attributes and @xmath14-@xmath15 characteristics very similar to the original phenomenological fitc predictions .",
    "in other words , short nanoconstrictions with a transverse dimension smaller than the cutoff wavelength ( of a waveguide ) can host thermally fluctuation induced tunneling conduction process at finite temperatures .",
    "@xcite the extracted potential barrier height and width according to this microscopic model are predicted to be much more realistic .",
    "( a)(c ) schematic diagrams depicting three types of insulating barrier : ( a ) a comparatively uniform oxide barrier , ( b ) an oxide barrier with two hot spots ( close approaches ) but no pinholes , and ( c ) an oxide barrier with two pinholes .",
    "the red dashed or solid curves in each case schematically depicts the electron transport process .",
    "( d ) schematic diagram showing the four - probe measurement method on a tunnel junction . ]    on the experimental side , it is surprising that the possible occurrence of the fitc - like mechanism in mim multilayered structures has never been reported , even though the formation of hot spots is very likely in certain junctions . in this paper , we present our observations of the fitc process governed @xmath3 features and @xmath14-@xmath15 characteristics in micrometer - sized al / alo@xmath0/y tunnel junctions in a wide temperature range 1.5300 k. the extracted parameters are examined in terms of the presence of hot spots in the alo@xmath0 layer , which mimics the short nanoconstrictions in the microscopic fitc model .",
    "our results are presented below .",
    "the fabrication method of our planar tunnel junctions was described previously .",
    "@xcite the designed geometrical junction area @xmath18 ( @xmath1 20@xmath1920 @xmath20m@xmath21 ) was defined by the electron - beam lithography technique . both the bottom al ( @xmath1 30 nm thickness ) and the top y ( @xmath1 100 nm thickness ) electrodes were deposited by thermal evaporation . prior to the deposition of the top y electrode , an insulating alo@xmath0 layer ( @xmath1 1.52 nm thickness on average )",
    "was grown on the top surface of the al base electrode by the o@xmath2 glow discharge .",
    "@xcite low angle x - ray diffraction studies revealed an amorphous structure of the oxide layer .",
    "the temperature dependent zero - bias resistance @xmath22 and the @xmath14-@xmath15 curves of the junctions were measured by the four - probe method [ fig .",

    "we first discern the three possible types of junction - barrier interfacial roughness that can emerge in a fabricated mim tunnel junction .",
    "figure  [ fig_1](a ) depicts the normal case where the interfacial roughness is moderate .",
    "electron tunneling occurs more or less evenly over the entire geometrical area @xmath18 , and the @xmath13 dependence of the junction conductance @xmath4 obeys the well - established simmons law . @xcite in the opposite case [ fig .",
    "[ fig_1](c ) ] , pinholes may exist in the barrier , shorting the two electrodes , and cause overall metallic features of @xmath3 .",
    "what is more interesting and will be the focus of this paper is the intermediate case [ fig .",
    "[ fig_1](b ) ] , where the interfacial roughness is notable but pinholes are just about to fully develop .",
    "electron tunneling then occurs predominantly at the sharp points of the closest approaches of the top and bottom electrodes .",
    "experimentally , the locations of such hot spots ( incomplete pinholes ) may be identified by mapping the tunnel current over the lateral area @xmath18 , e.g. , from conducting atomic force microscopy study at room temperature .",
    "@xcite alternatively , the occurrence of such hot spots can substantiate the fitc process in a wide @xmath13 range from liquid - helium temperatures to room temperature , @xcite as we demonstrate below in micrometer - sized al / alo@xmath0/y tunnel junctions .",

    "[ i.e. , the size of a hot spot depicted in fig .  [ fig_1](b ) , where @xmath26 can lead to large random thermal voltages @xmath9 that fluctuate across the narrow gap , which would in turn effectively lower and narrow the shape of the potential barrier . as a consequence , electron tunneling",
    "would be significantly influenced , causing @xmath3 to increase exponentially with increasing @xmath13 .",

    "@xcite surprisingly , although the interfacial roughness must be very common in artificially fabricated mim tunnel junctions , @xcite the possible manifestation of the fitc process through hot spots in the oxide layer has never been reported in the literature .    in this work ,",
    "a dozen of al / alo@xmath0/y junctions have been fabricated and studied . in the following ,",
