    "the mechanism of quark and gluon confinement is not fully understood yet .",
    "the study of the fundamental green s functions of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , namely the gluon and ghost propagators , can help in the understanding of such mechanism .",
    "indeed , there are gluon confinement criteria connected with the behaviour of the propagators at zero momentum .",
    "in particular , the zwanziger horizon condition implies a null zero momentum gluon propagator @xmath3 , and the kugo - ojima confinement mechanism requires an infinite zero momentum ghost propagator @xmath4 .",
    "the violation of positivity for the gluon propagator can also be seen as a signal for confinement .    in qcd",
    ", the investigation of its infrared limit has to rely on non - perturbative methods like the dyson - schwinger equations ( dse ) and lattice qcd .",
    "both methods have good and bad features , namely we can solve analitically the dse in the infrared , but one has to rely on a truncation of an infinite tower of equations . on the lattice , one includes all non - perturbative physics , but one has to care about finite volume and finite lattice spacing effects .",
    "recent studies of dyson - schwinger equations obtained a pure power law behaviour for the infrared gluon and ghost dressing functions ,    @xmath5    with @xmath6 @xcite , which implies a vanishing ( infinite ) gluon ( ghost ) propagator for zero momentum .",
    "studies using functional renormalization equations @xcite provided bounds in the possible values of the infrared exponent @xmath7 . the infrared exponent obtained from time independent stochastic quantisation @xcite is within these bounds ( @xmath8 ) .    as an infrared ( ir ) analytical solution of dse ,",
    "the pure power law is valid only for very low momenta . in figure",
    "[ dsepower ] , the dse gluon and ghost propagators @xcite are compared with the corresponding pure power law solution .",
    "note that for the gluon propagator the power law is valid only for momenta below 200 mev , and for the ghost the infrared solution is restricted to even lower momenta .",
    "if one wants to use lattice qcd to check for a pure power law behaviour , certainly one should consider a lattice volume sufficiently large to accomodate a minimum number of points in the region of interest . for symmetric lattices this would require a too large volume .",
    "a cheaper solution is the use of large asymmetric lattices @xmath9 , with @xmath10 .",
    "for example , in @xcite we use a set of asymmetric lattices with @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( see @xcite for the technical details of the simulations ) . the large temporal size of these lattices allow to access to momenta as low as 48 mev .",
    "of course , the price to pay are finite volume effects caused by the small value of @xmath13 .",
    "recently , some criticism have been raised against the use of asymmetric lattices to study the infrared limit of qcd green s functions . in @xcite",
    ", the authors studied the gluon and ghost propagators in su(2 ) 3-d theory and reported systematic effects due to the asymmetry of the lattice , if one compares with a symmetric one .",
    "of course , this comparison can not be done in our case .",
    "also in @xcite the author reported asymmetry effects in the propagators .",
    "however , in what concerns the gluon propagator , such effects have been already investigated in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite it is shown that the approach @xmath14 is smooth .",
    "indeed , a quick look at the gluon and ghost data in @xcite , again , suggests that the approach @xmath14 is smooth , i. e. that the largest symmetric propagators can be obtained by extrapolation of the asymmetric ones . in what concerns the quantitative results coming from a single large asymmetric lattice ,",
    "all the above studies show that they provide , at least , a bound on the infinite volume limit . here",
    "we report on the status of our investigations concerning the use of asymmetric lattices to study the infrared properties of qcd . in what concerns the positivity violation of the gluon propagator",

    "@xmath19 lattices.,width=302 ]    in what concerns the spatial size , it was observed that the propagator depends on the spatial size of the lattice ( see figure [ finvolir ] ) .",
    "the gluon propagator decreases with the volume for the smallest momenta and increases with the volume for higher momenta .    , considering only pure temporal momenta . for comparisation , we also show the @xmath20 and @xmath21 propagators computed in @xcite.,width=302 ]    in order to compute the infrared exponent @xmath1 from the lattice data , we considered fits of the smallest temporal momenta of the gluon dressing function @xmath22 to a pure power law with and without polinomial corrections .",
