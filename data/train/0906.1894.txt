    "cold atoms in optical lattices exhibit phenomena typical of solid state physics like the formation of energy bands , josephson effects bloch oscillations and strongly correlated phases .",
    "many of these phenomena have been already the object of experimental investigations . for a recent review see @xcite .",
    "standard methods to observe quantum properties of ultracold atoms are based on destructive matter - wave interference between atoms released from traps @xcite .",
    "recently , a new approach was proposed which is based on all optical measurements that conserve the number of atoms .",
    "it was shown that atomic quantum statistics can be mapped on transmission spectra of high - q cavities , where atoms create a quantum refractive index .",
    "this was shown to be useful for studying phase transitions between mott insulator and superfluid states since various phases show qualitatively distinct spectra @xcite .",
    "experimental implementation of a combination of cold atoms and cavity qed ( quantum electrodynamics ) has made significant progress @xcite .",
    "theoretically there have been some interesting work on the correlated atom - field dynamics in a cavity .",
    "it has been shown that the strong coupling of the condensed atoms to the cavity mode changes the resonance frequency of the cavity @xcite .",
    "finite cavity response times lead to damping of the coupled atom - field excitations @xcite . the driving field in the cavity",
    "can significantly enhance the localization and the cooling properties of the system@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that in a cavity the atomic back action on the field introduces atom - field entanglement which modifies the associated quantum phase transition @xcite . the light field and the atoms become strongly entangled if the latter are in a superfluid state , in which case the photon statistics typically exhibits complicated multimodal structures @xcite .",
    "a coherent control over the superfluid properties of the bec can also be achieved with the cavity and pump @xcite    in this work , we show that a nonlinear two - photon interaction between the superfluid ( sf ) phase and the mott insulating ( mi ) phase of a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) ( confined in an optical lattice ) and the cavity field show qualitatively different transmission spectra compared to the one - photon interaction .",
    "two - photon spectroscopy played a very important role in the studies of bec of atomic hydrogen @xcite .",
    "two - photon excitation of @xmath0 atoms to a rydberg state was also achieved recently@xcite .",
    "the system we consider here is an ensemble of @xmath1 two - level atoms with upper and lower states denoted by @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively in an optical lattice with @xmath4 sites formed by far off resonance standing wave laser beams inside a cavity .",
    "a region of @xmath5 sites is coupled to two light modes as shown in fig.1 .",
    "fig.1 shows two cavities containing the two modes @xmath6 and @xmath7 crossed by a one - dimensional optical lattice confining the bec . in the two - photon process ,",
    "an intermediate level @xmath8 is involved , which is assumed to be coupled to @xmath2 and @xmath3 by dipole allowed transitions .",
    "the manybody hamiltonian in the second quantized form is given by    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we present the transmission spectra for the one - photon case(thin line ) and two photon ( thick line ) case in the sf state in fig.1(a ) and that in the mott state in fig.1(b ) for the case where @xmath9 .",
    "clearly for both the cases , the transmission spectra is a sum of lorentzians with different dispersion shifts .",
    "a comb like structure is seen if each lorentzian is resolved .",
    "however the separation between the lorentzians for the two - photon case ( @xmath10 ) is much larger than that for the one - photon case(@xmath11).such a spectra can be reproduced experimentally by repeated measurements over a long time scale so that a superposition of different atomic distributions(obtained by tunneling ) contibutes to the spectra . in the mott state ,",
    "the difference between the one - photon interaction(thin line ) and the two - photon interaction ( thick line ) is striking . in the one - photon case , two - satellite contour is observed reflecting normal mode splitting of the two oscillators @xmath12 coupled through atoms .",
    "this splitting is absent in the two - photon case .",
    "a probable explanation for this observation can be traced back to the hamiltonian @xmath13 of eqn . [ 2 ] . in the absence of any optical grating the atomic grating is not formed and as a result diffraction of one mode into the other is absent ( absence of bragg scattering ) . in the one photon case , the two modes are bahaving like two independent oscillators exchanging energy via the atoms . in the two - photon transition",
    ", there is no energy exchange between the two modes but energy exchange occurs between the atoms and the two modes ( taken together ) .",
    "the system then behaves effectively as a two - level atom interacting with a single mode via one - photon transition .",
    "the results for the case @xmath14 is shown in fig.2 .",
    "as found in @xcite , the comb like structure for the sf case is replaced by a broad lorentzian for both the single - photon and two - photon case ( fig2a ) . for the mott case ,",
    "however , the peaks are broadened and the two - photon single peak shifts i.e , the dispersion is reduced .    from the experimental point of view , such a two photon excitation has already been achieved in @xmath15 atoms @xcite and atomic hydrogen bec @xcite . using the setup described in @xcite , @xmath15-atoms are magnetcally trapped in the @xmath16 state and produce samples from thermal clouds to becs by means of forced rf evaporation . after this preparation ,",
    "the atoms are subject to a two - photon rydberg excitation ( using @xmath17 and @xmath18 lasers ) via the @xmath19 state to the @xmath20 state with a length of the square light pulses between @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "to reduce spontaneous photon scattering , the light is blue detuned by @xmath23 from the @xmath24 level .",
    "thus only one photon per 100 atoms is scattered for the longest excitation time .",
    "however in such experiments the excitation is locally blocked by the van der walls interaction between rydberg atoms .",
    "we have investigated off - resonant collective light scattering from a bose einstein condensate trapped in an optical lattice interacting with two cavity modes via nonlinear two - photon transition .",
    "measuring the transmission spectra allows one to distinguish between a nonlinear two - photon interaction and a one - photon interaction .",
    "depending on the state of the bec , we found that the two - photon spectra is different from one - photon spectra .",
    "we found that when the bec is in the mott state , the usual normal mode splitting present in the one - photon transition is missing in the two - photon interaction . when the bec is in the superfluid state , the transmission spectra shows the usual multiple lorentzian structure .",
    "however the separation between the lorentzians for the two - photon case is much larger than that for the one - photon case .",
    "this method could be useful for non - destructive high resolution rydberg spectroscopy of ultracold atoms or two - photon spectroscopy of hydrogen bec .",
