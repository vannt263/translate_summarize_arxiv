    "<S> mechanical instability takes different forms in various ordered and disordered systems . </S>",
    "<S> we study the effect of thermal fluctuations in two disordered central - force lattice models near mechanical instability : randomly diluted triangular lattice and randomly braced square lattice . these two lattices exhibit different scalings for the emergence of rigidity at @xmath0 due to their different patterns of self stress at the transition . using analytic theory </S>",
    "<S> we show that thermal fluctuations stabilize both lattices . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the triangular lattice displays a critical regime in which the shear modulus scales as @xmath1 , whereas the square lattice shows @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> mechanical instability takes a rich variety of forms in systems ranging from granular matter to biological tissue and man - made structures  @xcite . even in lattice models where there is a remarkably simple principle </S>",
    "<S>  the maxwell s rule which compares discrete numbers of degrees of freedom and constraints  @xcite  multiple classes of distinct behaviors arise . </S>",
    "<S> mechanical instabilities in lattice models can take the form of either mean - field  @xcite or non mean - field  @xcite transitions , with continuous  @xcite or discontinuous  @xcite changes of various elastic moduli , and in some case even with a phonon structure of nontrivial topology  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one central concept in understanding these different classes of behaviors is _ self stress _ , which describes distributions of stress on bonds in the lattice with which the net force on every site vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> this is characterized by the generalized maxwell s rule  @xcite @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the dimension , @xmath5 is the number of sites , @xmath6 is the number of central force ( cf ) bonds , @xmath7 is the number of floppy modes , and @xmath8 is the number of states of self stress . according to this rule , each bond added to a lattice either removes one floppy mode or increases one state of self stress , and in the latter the bond can be considered as `` redundant . '' </S>",
    "<S> moreover , states of self stress are intimately related to elastic moduli because it describes the nature of stress the lattice can sustain  @xcite . whether a bond is redundant or not strongly depend on the architecture of the lattice  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus a small difference in the construction of the lattice can lead to very different behaviors near mechanical instability . </S>",
    "<S> different classes of lattice models have been found to relate to different experimental systems , such as jamming of spheres  @xcite , glasses  @xcite , and semi - flexible polymer networks  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> little is known about how thermal fluctuations affect mechanical instability in these different classes of models . in general , fluctuations have been shown to change conclusions from mean - field theories about transitions dramatically , e.g. , fluctuations can alter the order and scaling exponents of the transition , or even ruling out the ordered phase completely  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been pointed out that thermal fluctuations may stabilize under - coordinated networks in some special cases including crosslinked flexible polymer  @xcite , tethered networks  @xcite , diluted lattices  @xcite , and jammed packings  @xcite , but a generic theoretical framework for finite - temperature mechanical instability , especially in disordered systems , is still lacking </S>",
    "<S> . such generic theory will be important in understanding experimental observations of mechanical instability which are made at finite temperature .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we construct an analytic theory for disordered lattices near mechanical instability at finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> our theory treats thermal fluctuations through renormalization of elastic moduli and treats lattice disorder through the coherent potential approximation ( cpa )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we use this theory to discuss two cf lattice models , the randomly diluted triangular lattice  @xcite and the randomly braced square lattice  @xcite , both of which display mechanical instabilities when they pass through the cf isostatic point @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the coordination number . </S>",
    "<S> our main findings are summarized in the phase diagrams in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pd ] </S>",
    "<S> . the triangular lattice is stabilized by thermal fluctuations near the isostatic point , and it displays three regimes of elasticity , @xmath11 ( mechanical ) , @xmath12 ( critical ) , and @xmath13 ( entropic ) , consistent with numerical results in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly the square lattice shows very different exponents , e.g. , @xmath14 in the critical regime , as well as a nonaffine - affine crossover , originating from the sub - extensive number of states of self stress at the transition . </S>",

    "<S> _ model _  we consider two types of lattices near mechanical instability . </S>",
    "<S> the first one is the randomly diluted cf triangular lattice [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pd](a ) ] , in which each nearest - neighbor ( nn ) bond is of spring constant @xmath18 and is present with probability @xmath19 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : pd](b ) ] , in which all nn bonds are present with spring constant @xmath18 and each next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) bond of spring constant @xmath21 is present with probability @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 rigidity percolation of this model has been studied both numerically and analytically , revealing a transition at @xmath22 with mean - field exponents and features of both first- and second - order transitions .    </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of both lattices can be written as @xmath23 for a deformation that moves positions @xmath24 for each lattice site @xmath25 . here </S>",
    "<S> the sum is over all bonds @xmath26 , @xmath27 if the bond is present and @xmath28 if not , and @xmath29 is the vector of the bond in the reference space ( assuming all bonds to be at rest length in the reference space ) . in the triangular lattice @xmath30 , and in the square lattice @xmath30 for the nn bonds and @xmath31 for the nnn bonds .    </S>",
    "<S> we choose to use the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) for the disorder in these models . </S>",
    "<S> this method , also called the effective medium theory ( emt ) , has been shown to work very well for mechanical properties of disordered lattices  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the spirit of the original zero temperature cpa is that the disordered lattice can be mapped into an effective medium ( em ) regular lattice in which all bonds are present with an effective medium spring constant @xmath32 as a function of dilution @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> this mapping is determined by the self - consistency condition that if one randomly chosen bond in the em is replaced according to the rules of the original disordered lattice ( change into spring constant @xmath18 with probability @xmath19 and removed with probability @xmath33 ) , the average of the perturbed phonon green s function equals to the unperturbed em green s function .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we develop a version of the cpa that incorporates thermal fluctuation corrections in order to study finite-@xmath15 mechanical instability . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that the mapping to an em regular lattice still holds at finite temperature , but with a temperature dependent em spring constant @xmath34 , we characterize thermal fluctuation effects by calculating renormalized elastic moduli of the em as follows . </S>",
    "<S> consider a deformation @xmath35 where @xmath25 labels lattice sites , @xmath36 denote a macroscopic deformation gradient , and @xmath37 denote finite wavelength fluctuations around @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> free energy of the lattice at a given macroscopic deformation @xmath36 in finite temperature can be obtained by integrating out fluctuations @xmath37 , which yield a vibrational entropy term . </S>",
    "<S> although the hamiltonian contains only harmonic springs , expanding @xmath39 in terms of displacements generate higher order terms in displacements , and thus this entropic term depends on @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that ward identity holds for the fluctuation corrected free energy @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> details of this calculation is shown in the supplementary information ( si ) . </S>",
    "<S> we consider generic deformations of the form @xmath41 and taking derivatives of @xmath42 with respect to @xmath43 and @xmath44 yields the fluctuation corrected elastic moduli . </S>",
    "<S> we then obtain renormalized spring constants from these corrected elastic moduli .    </S>",
    "<S> next we use the cpa procedure to calculate the perturbed green s function as one bond is replaced @xmath45 where in the phonon green s function @xmath46 renormalized spring constants instead of the @xmath0 ones are used . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath47 is the perturbative potential describing changing the spring constant of a randomly chosen bond in the em , and @xmath48 is the @xmath49-matrix of this perturbation . in the case of replacing one cf bond this sum for the @xmath49-matrix </S>",

    "<S> _ results _  we first apply this finite temperature cpa to the diluted triangular lattices . </S>",
    "<S> the renormalized elastic moduli @xmath51 is determined by calculating shear rigidity of the em lattice @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the lattice constant and @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> we then extract the renormalized spring constant @xmath51 through the relation @xmath55 and find @xmath56 where the last term indicates an increase of em spring constant with @xmath15 , characterizing fluctuation stabilization of this lattice .    using this renormalized @xmath51 </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : g](a ) . because elastic moduli of the lattice at finite temperature are both proportional to @xmath32 </S>",

    "<S> we apply a similar calculation to randomly braced square lattices . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we determine renormalized nnn spring constant @xmath67 by again calculating finite temperature shear modulus , which yields @xmath68 comparing to eq .   </S>",
    "<S> we find that the renormalization of the nnn bond spring constant contains a non - analytic dependence on the ratio @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> this comes from the unique phonon structure of the square lattice , which exhibits lines of states of self stress and floppy phonon modes along @xmath70 and @xmath71 axis in the first brillouin zone , leading to non - analyticity in phonon green s functions .    </S>",
    "<S> the resulting finite-@xmath15 cpa self - consistency equation then reads @xmath72 its solution can be expanded in 3 regimes too @xmath73 corresponding to nonaffine mechanical , affine mechanical , and critical regimes , as shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> it is worth noting that the @xmath74 scaling agrees with the ordered lattice results in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite with @xmath22 .    </S>",
    "<S> _ discussions _  in both lattice models we found that thermal fluctuations provide stabilizing effect to elasticity , even when the lattice is below the isostatic point . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the square lattice finite-@xmath15 phase diagram near mechanical instability differs from that of the triangular lattice , because of the different structure of states of self stress in the square lattice .    </S>",
    "<S> there is an intuitive picture to understand the different regimes of the triangular lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanical regime for @xmath75 at low @xmath15 is straightforward  the lattice is stable at @xmath0 and thermal fluctuation simple provide small correction to elastic moduli . in the critical regime , </S>",
    "<S> the system starts to have some modes that are of very low stiffness . </S>",
    "<S> finite temperature behavior of these modes can be understood by considering the following simple example [ fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : onep](a ) ] . here a particle is connected by 2 springs in the @xmath76 direction to 2 walls and the springs are at rest length when the particle is at @xmath77 . assuming the 2 springs to be harmonic with force constant @xmath18 , the hamiltonian of the particle is to leading order @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the rest length of the springs </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that vibrations in @xmath80 is a floppy mode of this simple system because its @xmath0 stiffness @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> equivalently , the `` shear modulus '' of the system ( resistance to transverse displacement @xmath43 of the top wall ) is also @xmath28 . at finite @xmath15 </S>",
    "<S> , the shear modulus can be calculated using canonical ensemble ( see si ) @xmath82 where @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> this @xmath84 thermal stiffness for floppy modes is an intuitive way to understand the critical regime in the diluted triangular lattice , because in this regime , there is only a small number of floppy modes @xmath85 with positive coefficients for @xmath86 terms in @xmath39 , giving them entropic rigidity of @xmath87 .     resistance to transverse deformation . </S>",
    "<S> one example of instantaneous fluctuation configuration is shown in gray . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) a schematic picture of floppy modes further below the isostatic point , in which large fluctuations ( gray ) cost no energy . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to @xmath88 rigidity . ]    </S>",
    "<S> when the diluted lattice is deeper below @xmath89 there are more floppy modes which allow large fluctuations ( flat energy landscape , no quartic term ) , and the corresponding physics , as shown in fig.3b , is more like a traditional `` entropic elasticity '' picture for flexible polymers . </S>",
    "<S> thus the corresponding entropic elasticity is proportional to @xmath15 as in the case of polymers .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , in these simple pictures and our lattice model , at finite @xmath15 a _ negative stress _ is generated by thermal fluctuations , and we take fixed volume ensemble to avoid collapsing . </S>",
    "<S> however , fluctuation stabilization of elasticity is not limited to the case with fixed volume . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite that with zero pressure but self - avoidance between bonds , similar stabilization and scalings are observed . in our theory , this correspond to allow a negative thermal expansion at finite @xmath15 , and add additional anharmonic terms in the hamiltonian to provide stability . </S>",
    "<S> an analytic theory of this effect in ordered lattices has been discussed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our analytic calculations on lattice models provide a simple framework to explore fluctuation effects in more complicated systems near mechanical instability . </S>",
    "<S> for example , recent studies on jamming at finite temperature revealed significant fluctuation stabilization effect below point j ( @xmath90 )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it would be interesting to consider variations of our lattice models to include effects such as one - sided potential and bond - breaking to capture regimes of elasticity near point j. </S>"
