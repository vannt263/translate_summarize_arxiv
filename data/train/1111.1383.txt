    "lorentz invariance is one of the foundations of the standard model of particle physics .",
    "the constraints on possible lorentz violating phenomenology are quite severe , see for example , the summary tables that provided by kostelecky _",
    "et al_.@xcite .",
    "the gravitational interaction is far more weak , compare to other fundamental interactions .",
    "this allows one to study the possible lorentz violating effects on certain gravity theories , such as einstein - aether theory @xcite and horava - lifshitz theory @xcite .",
    "one feature of lorentz invariance violation is that the speed of light differ from the one in special relativity .",
    "the gravity theories with lorentz violation could have the feature that the speed of graviton or the speed of gravitational wave differ from the one in general relativity . studying",
    "the speed of gravitational wave in a lorentz violating gravity theory will give different perspective on quantum gravitational phenomena .",
    "one of the most important prediction of einstein s general relativity is gravitational radiation .",
    "many pioneer works @xcite have discussed the gravitational radiation in both theoretical properties and experimental approaches of detections . currently , the most sensitive measurement is provided by ground - based laser interferometer gravitational - wave observatory ( ligo ) detector @xcite .",
    "another sensitive measurement , which is in progress , is the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) that detect and accurately measure gravitational waves from astronomical sources .",
    "the primordial gravitational waves @xcite could be of interest to cosmologists as they provide a new and unique window on the earliest moments in the history of the universe and on possible new physics at energies many orders of magnitude beyond those accessible at particle accelerators .    in general relativity ,",
    "the effects of gravitation are ascribed to spacetime curvature instead of a force . however , up to now , general relativity still faces problems .",
    "first , the recent astronomical observations @xcite found that our universe is accelerated expanding . this result can not be obtained directly from einstein s gravity and his cosmological principle . since normal matters only provide attractive force .",
    "the most widely adopted way to resolve it is involving the so called dark energy which provides the repulsive force .",
    "second , the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies violate the prediction of einstein s gravity @xcite .",
    "the most widely adopted way to resolve it is involving the so called dark matter which provides enough attractive force such that the discrepancy is restored .",
    "the above astronomical phenomena occur at very large cosmological scale .",
    "the following anomalies occur in solar system which imply the newton s inverse - square law of universal gravitation and general relativity need modifications .",
    "the third one , two pioneer spacecrafts suffer an anomalous constant sunward acceleration , @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the fourth one , it has been observed at various occasions that satellites after an earth swing - by possess a significant unexplained velocity increase by a few mm / s @xcite .    the fifth one , from the analysis of radiometric measurements of distances between the earth and the major planets including observations from martian orbiters and landers from 1961 to 2003 a secular trend of the astronomical unit of @xmath1 m / cy has been reported @xcite .",
    "the sixth one , a recent orbital analysis of lunar laser ranging ( llr ) @xcite shows an anomalous secular eccentricity variation of the moon s orbit @xmath2 .",
    "all the facts imply that the einstein s theory should be modified . by mimicking einstein ,",
    "we have proposed that the modified gravitational theory should correspond to a new geometry which involves riemann geometry as its special case .",
    "finsler geometry @xcite as a nature extension of riemann geometry is a good candidate to solve the problems mentioned above .",
    "a new geometry ( finsler geometry ) involves new spacetime symmetry .",
    "the lorentz violation is intimately linked to finsler geometry .",
    "kostelecky @xcite have studied effective field theories with explicit lorentz violation in finsler spacetime .",
    "finsler geometry really gives better description for the nature of gravity : the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies can be deduced naturally without invoking dark matter @xcite ; a finlerian gravity model could account for the accelerated expanding university without invoking dark energy @xcite ; a special finsler space - randers space @xcite could account for the anomalous acceleration @xcite in solar system observed by pioneer 10 and 11 spacecrafts ; the finsler spacetime could give a modification on the gravitational deflection of light @xcite , which may account to these observations without adding dark matter in bullet cluster @xcite ; the result based on the kinematics with a special finsler spacetime is in good agreement with secular trend of the astronomical unit and secular eccentricity variation of the moon s orbit @xcite .",
    "it is interest to investigate the gravitational wave in finsler spacetime .",
    "it is well known that the gravitational wave propagates with the speed of light in general relativity .",
    "this is due to the fact that the spacetime metric is close to the minkowski metric in the weak gravitational field approximation , and the causal speed of minkowski spacetime is just the speed of light . however , in finsler spacetime the causal speed is generally different with the speed of light @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will present the solution of linearized gravitational vacuum field equation in finsler spacetime .",
    "it is shown that there is possibility that the causal speed of it is larger than the speed of light .",
    "instead of defining an inner product structure over the tangent bundle in riemann geometry , finsler geometry is based on the so called finsler structure @xmath3 with the property @xmath4 for all @xmath5 , where @xmath6 represents position and @xmath7 represents velocity . the finsler metric is given as @xcite @xmath8 finsler geometry has its genesis in integrals of the form @xmath9 the finsler structure represents the length element of finsler space .",

    ". obviously , if @xmath3 is riemannian metric , then @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the riemannian christoffel symbol .",
    "since the geodesic equation ( [ geodesic ] ) is directly derived from the integral length @xmath15 the inner product @xmath16 of two parallel transported vectors is preserved .    in finsler manifold , there exists a linear connection  -  the chern connection @xcite .",
    "it is torsion freeness and almost metric - compatibility , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the formal christoffel symbols of the second kind with the same form of riemannian connection , @xmath19 is defined as @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the cartan tensor ( regarded as a measurement of deviation from the riemannian manifold ) . in terms of chern connection , the curvature of finsler space is given as @xmath22 where @xmath23 .",
    "the gravity in finsler spacetime has been investigated for a long time @xcite . in this paper , we introduce vacuum field equation by the way discussed first by pirani @xcite . in newton s theory of gravity , the equation of motion of a test particle is given as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the gravitational potential and @xmath26 is euclidean metric .",
    "for an infinitesimal transformation @xmath27(@xmath28 ) , the equation ( [ dynamic newton ] ) becomes , up to first order in @xmath29 , @xmath30 combining the above equations([dynamic newton ] ) and ( [ dynamic newton1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath31 in newton s theory of gravity , the vacuum field equation is given as @xmath32 .",

    "here , @xmath44 is finsler curvature tensor defined in ( [ finsler curvature ] ) , @xmath37 denotes covariant derivative @xmath45 . since the vacuum field equations of newton s gravity and general relativity have similar form , we may assume that vacuum field equation in finsler spacetime hold similar requirement as the case of netwon s gravity and general relativity .",
    "it implies that the tensor @xmath46 in finsler geodesic deviation equation should be traceless , @xmath47 .",
    "we have proved that the analogy from the geodesic deviation equation is valid at least in finsler spacetime of berwald type @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we may suppose that this analogy is valid in general finsler spacetime .",
    "it should be noticed that @xmath48 is called the ricci scaler , which is a geometrical invariant . for a tangent plane @xmath49 and a non - zero vector @xmath50 ,",
    "the flag curvature is defined as @xmath51 where @xmath52 .",
    "the flag curvature is a geometrical invariant that generalizes the sectional curvature of riemannian geometry .",
    "it is clear that the ricci scaler @xmath53 is the trace of @xmath46 , which is the predecessor of flag curvature .",
    "therefore , the value of ricci scaler @xmath53 is invariant under the ordinate transformation .",
    "furthermore , the predecessor of flag curvature could be written in terms of the geodesic spray coefficient @xmath54 thus , the ricci scaler @xmath53 is insensitive to connection that one is using , it only depends on the length element @xmath3 .",

    "it is hard to find a non trivial solution of the gravitational vacuum field equation ( @xmath55 ) in finsler spacetime . here , we study the weak field radiative solution of the finslerian vacuum field equation @xmath55 .",
    "it is well known that the minkowski spacetime is a trivial solution of einstein s vacuum field equation . in the finsler spacetime",
    ", the trivial solution of finslerian vacuum field equation is called locally minkowski spacetime .",
    "a finsler spacetime is called a locally minkowshi spacetime if there is a local coordinate system @xmath56 , with induced tangent space coordinates @xmath57 , such that @xmath3 depends only on @xmath58 and not on @xmath6 . using the formula ( [ predecessor flag curvature ] ) , one knows obvious that locally minkowski spacetime is a solution of finslerian vacuum field equation .",
