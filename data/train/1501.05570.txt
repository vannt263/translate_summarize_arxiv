    "designing the electromagnetic response of an artificial medium is one of the main target of modern photonics and metamaterial science is probably the most important research field based on such skill .",
    "basically the design is made possible by the physical fact that the electromagnetic field , when traveling within a nonhomogeneous medium with sub - wavelength features , is not able to follow its spatial rapidly - varying details so that the field only experiences the effect of an averaged or effective medium .",
    "a number of different homogenization approaches have been developed for predicting the effective medium electromagnetic response and they exploit different and suitable approximation schemes . the simplest homogenization technique deals with the retrieval of the effective parameters from the scattering properties of the medium @xcite and it is based on postulating the equivalence between a complex metamaterial array and a uniform slab of same thickness with unknown constitutive parameters .",
    "another homogenization technique is the field averaging method which is based on the averaging of the electromagnetic field in a metamaterial unit cell @xcite and , in analogy with the retrieval technique , it is a numerical method for the determination of effective parameters .",
    "in addition to numerical methods , mean - field homegenization theories are available where the effective parameters are evaluated from the distribution of the underlying metamaterial inclusions .",
    "examples of such techniques are those exploiting lorentz @xcite , clausius - mossotti @xcite , maxwell - garnett @xcite approximations , or based on multipolar expansion @xcite and source - driven approach @xcite . spatial periodicity and rapidly - varying spatial scales are the two basic ingredients of each metamaterial homogenization approach .",
    "two different homogenization techniques are obtained by assuming one of these two ingredients and subsequently incorporating the other .",
    "therefore , starting from the photonic - crystal description of the structure where the spatial periodicity is fully taken into account , the effective medium response can be extracted in the long wavelength regime @xcite .",
    "conversely , the spatial rapidly - varying metamaterial features allows an asymptotic multi - scale analysis of the sample electromagnetic response which combined with the array periodicity yields the effective medium response @xcite .",
    "even though the metamaterial inclusions pattering has a spatial scale much smaller than the radiation wavelength , such two scales are generally not so different to allow a description of the effective medium response only comprising effective dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability tensors . for this reason",
    ", the effective medium generally shows an additional nonlocal respose @xcite yielding spatial dispersion .",
    "it is well - known that the nonlocal first order contribution ( i.e. containing first order spatial derivatives of the electric field ) is equivalent to a reciprocal bianisotropic response @xcite whereas the second order contribution can be partially interpreted as a correction to the effective magnetic permeability tensor @xcite , a phenomenon which is known as artificial or optical magnetism @xcite .",
    "if the effective nonlocality is weak , the effective medium response is adequately described by reciprocal bianisotropic constitutive relations where the chirality tensor accounts for the strength of magnetic and electric polarizations coupling . an efficient way for observing the effect of electromagnetic chirality is considering metamaterials whose underlying constituents pattering exhibits chiral asymmetry , i.e. its mirror image can not be superposed onto it , and theoretical and experimental investigations have been performed both in three - dimensional @xcite and in two - dimensional configurations @xcite .",
    "chiral metamaterials have attracted a good deal of attention since they can yield giant optical activity , asymmetric transmission @xcite , repulsive casimir force @xcite , backward waves @xcite and negative refractive index @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we theoretically investigate the electromagnetic response in the long wavelength regime of a periodic composite medium , whose inclusions are non - magnetic , and we carry out the analysis by including spatial dispersion up to the second order .",
    "specifically , by using the ratio @xmath2 between the composite periodicity and the wavelength as an asymptotic expansion parameter , we exploit a general multiscale technique for separating the fast matter scale from the slow radiation one and to extract the average effect of the composite on the electromagnetic field .",
    "we fully develop the analysis up to the second order in @xmath2 and we find that the obtained effective medium response has a @xmath3 order reproducing the know results of standard homogenization approaches and @xmath4 and @xmath5 orders accounting for first and second order effective medium nonlocality , respectively .",
    "the effective dielectric permittivity tensor ( of rank two ) arising from the zeroth order is obtained by averaging over the metamataterial unit cell specific fast - varying fields satisfying electrostatic - like equations .",
    "the main result of the present paper is that this very simple procedure still works for evaluating the two tensors ( of ranks three and four , respectively ) describing effective medium nonlocality up to the second order and the corresponding electrostatic - like equations for the suitable fast - varying fields to be averaged are here derived and discussed . as a consequence we obtain a simple scheme for evaluating the effective medium response up to the second order which is based on solving a small number of poisson equations on the metamaterial unit cell .",
    "in particular we obtain a very compact expression for the three - rank tensor describing first order spatial nonlocality which remarkably reveals that it can be evaluated by using the same fast - varying fields appearing in the zeroth order description , thus avoiding the requirement of solving additional electrostatic - like equations . therefore the ensuing procedure for deducing the medium response up to",
    "the first order is remarkably simple and compact . for metamaterials with negligible second - order spatial dispersion , we combine the obtained description with the equivalence of first - order spatial dispersion and reciprocal bianisotropic electromagnetic response to obtain a compact and simple expression for the effective medium chirality tensor .",
    "using such expression we investigate the impact of the composite patterning symmetry on electromagnetic chirality .",
    "specifically we obtain that if the composite does not show chiral asymmetry , i.e. its mirror image can be superposed on it , the effective chiral tensor vanishes with two remarkable exceptions corresponding to the specific cases where the rotation needed to superpose the mirror image onto the structure is either a @xmath0 or @xmath1 rotation around an axis orthogonal to the reflection plane . in these two situations",
    "the composite is geometrically achiral and it nonetheless shows electromagnetic chirality whose chiral tensor turns out to be that of pseudo - chiral - omega medium .",
    "such general result encompasses in particular the relevant cases of two - dimensional and recently considered one - dimensional metamaterials showing chiral response . as an example admitting full analytical description ,",
    "we discuss one - dimensional metamaterials whose single chirality parameter is shown to be directly related to the metamaterial dielectric profile by quadratures .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "vi we draw our conclusions .",
    "let us consider propagation of a monochromatic electromagnetic field through an unbounded metamaterial whose underlying non - magnetic inclusions ( both metal and dielectric ) are arranged on a lattice whose period is much smaller than the radiation wavelength @xmath6 .",
    "the electric @xmath7 and magnetic @xmath8 field amplitudes satisfy maxwell equations @xmath9 where time dependence @xmath10 has been assumed and the medium relative dielectric constant @xmath11 is a periodic complex function having the same periodicity of the metamaterial .",
    "due to the rapidly varying dielectric spatial modulation it is convenient to introduce the parameter @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the largest of the lattice basis vector lengths . following the standard multiscale technique , it is possible to exploit the condition @xmath14 to develop an asymptotic analysis of electromagnetic propagation .",
    "accordingly , we introduce the fast spatial coordinates @xmath15 , regarded as independent from the slow coordinates @xmath16 .",
    "any field @xmath17 can be decomposed as @xmath18 where the overline denote the spatial average over the metamaterial unit cell , i.e @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the unit cell and @xmath21 is its volume scaled by @xmath22 , and the tilde denote the rapidly varying zero mean residual , i.e. @xmath23 . in our scheme",
    "the relative dielectric permittivity depends on the fast coordinates only so that we set @xmath24 and it can be decomposed as @xmath25 . following the general multiscale technique @xcite , we set for the electromagnetic field amplitudes @xmath26 @xmath27 \\eta^n,\\ ] ] or , in other words , the field amplitudes are expanded in powers of @xmath2 and , for each order , the average on the unit cell ( terms with an overbar and depending on the slow coordinates only ) is separated from the zero mean residual ( terms with an overtilde and depending on both slow and fast coordinates ) . after substituting eqs.([two - scale ] ) into eqs.([maxwell ] ) and noting that @xmath28 it is possible to extract equations for each order and , for each of them , to separately balance the averaged contributions and zero mean residuals . as a result , for the averaged equations we obtain @xmath29 whereas for the zero mean residual equations we have @xmath30\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 .",
    "equations ( [ n - slowly ] ) do not contain the fast coordinates @xmath32 and are coupled to the rapidly varying field orders only through the averaged term @xmath33 .",

    "the latter contribution is obtained by summing the spatial average of the rapidly varying fields @xmath42 multiplied by the dielectric permittivity arising from each order .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain an effective medium description of the metamaterial response , such rapidly varying fields have to be related to the slowly varying ones through eqs.([n - rapid ] ) .    from the structure of eqs.([n - rapid ] ) we note that the fields @xmath43 and @xmath44 have to be evaluated recursively from the knowledge of @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",

    "we have exploited our approach to investigate the relation between geometrical and electromagnetic chirality by proving that the latter is shown , in addition to chiral media , even by an achiral medium whose mirror image can be superposed onto it by means of a @xmath0 or @xmath1 rotation around an axis orthogonal to the reflection plane .",

    "<S> we develop , from first principles , a general and compact formalism for predicting the electromagnetic response of a metamaterial with non - magnetic inclusions in the long wavelength limit , including spatial dispersion up to the second order . specifically , by resorting to a suitable multiscale technique , </S>",
    "<S> we show that medium effective permittivity tensor and the first and second order tensors describing spatial dispersion can be evaluated by averaging suitable spatially rapidly - varying fields each satysifing electrostatic - like equations within the metamaterial unit cell . for metamaterials with negligible second - order spatial dispersion </S>",
    "<S> , we exploit the equivalence of first - order spatial dispersion and reciprocal bianisotropic electromagnetic response to deduce a simple expression for the metamaterial chirality tensor . </S>",
    "<S> such an expression allows us to systematically analyze the effect of the composite spatial symmetry properties on electromagnetic chirality . </S>",
    "<S> we find that even if a metamaterial is geometrically achiral , i.e. it is indistinguishable from its mirror image , it shows pseudo - chiral - omega electromagnetic chirality if the rotation needed to restore the dielectric profile after the reflection is either a @xmath0 or @xmath1 rotation around an axis orthogonal to the reflection plane . </S>",
    "<S> these two symmetric situations encompass two - dimensional and one - dimensional metamaterials with chiral response . as an example admitting full analytical description , </S>",
    "<S> we discuss one - dimensional metamaterials whose single chirality parameter is shown to be directly related to the metamaterial dielectric profile by quadratures . </S>"
