    "the higgs sector of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite , especially the heavy neutral higgses @xmath2 and @xmath3 , play a prominent role in the physics of neutralino dark matter  @xcite . in some region of the supersymmetric ( susy )",
    "parameter space neutralinos yield the desired amount of relic density by annihilating into fermions through the @xmath4-channel resonant exchange of neutral higgs bosons @xmath5 ,",
    "@xmath3 , @xmath2 , the so called funnel region where @xmath6 ; besides , as dark matter is expected to be distributed in a halo surrounding our galaxy , neutralinos can scatter off nuclei in terrestrial detectors : the coherent scattering is mediated by scalar interactions through the @xmath4-channel exchange of squarks and @xmath7-channel exchange of the cp - even neutral higgs bosons @xmath5 and @xmath3 .",
    "these effects become sizable when squarks are heavy and @xmath8 is large in reason of the enhanced higgs bosons coupling to down - type fermions , especially for the @xmath9 quark which has the largest yukawa coupling receiving large radiative susy - qcd corrections at large @xmath8 .",
    "once a source of lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) is present in the slepton mass matrix , for example the mssm with the see saw mechanism for generation of small neutrino masses  @xcite , non - holomorphic lfv yukawa couplings of the type @xmath10 are induced at loop level and become particularly sizable at large @xmath8 giving rise to enhanced higgs - mediated lfv effects  @xcite .",
    "the lfv mass insertions @xmath11 , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 are the off - diagonal flavor changing entries of the slepton mass matrix , are free parameters which allow for a model independent study of lfv signals .",
    "we introduce lfv in the model through the mass insertions @xmath14 .",
    "this value ensures the largest rates in lfv processes and allow us to study the more optimistic scenarios for lfv detection ; higher values contradict the mass insertion approximation as an expansion of propagators in this small parameters .",
    "higgs mediated effects become interesting at large @xmath15 and @xmath8 and low @xmath16 ; further , if susy - qcd particles are heavy , higgs effects are dominant also for neutralino dark matter .",
    "we thus consider the following real mssm parameter space : 100 gev @xmath171 tev , 20@xmath1860 , 500 gev@xmath195 tev , ( the sign of @xmath15 is taken positive , as preferred by the susy explanation of the @xmath20 anomaly ) , 150 gev@xmath211.5 tev ( we do not impose any relation but let them vary independently allowing for gaugino non - universality at the weak scale ) , 1 tev @xmath22 5 tev ( to have large masses for gluinos ) , 1 tev@xmath235 tev ( for the first and the second generation the soft masses are set to be equal , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is another free parameter which varies in the same range ) , 300 gev@xmath27 2.5 tev ( for the first and the second generation the slepton soft masses are set to be equal , @xmath28 , where @xmath25 and @xmath29 ) , -2@xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 while for first and second generation the trilinear scalar couplings are set to zero .",
    "we impose on the parameter space several experimental limits : ( 1 ) lep , tevatron bounds on sparticle masses and the lep bound on light higgs ; ( 2 ) present bounds on @xmath33-physics observables @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 ; ( 3 ) the present experimental upper bounds on lfv processes @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , ( 4 ) the exclusion limits on the neutralino - nucleus spin independent cross section from the cdms experiment  @xcite ; ( 5 ) the cdf exclusion exclusion limits in the ( @xmath16 , @xmath8 ) plane  @xcite .",
    "all of them are applied at the same time with the exception of the wmap @xmath41 interval on relic density and @xmath42 anomaly for which we also relax the lower bounds : thus in the following figures the light gray ( turquoise ) points have only @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the plus - shaped points dark - gray ( indigo ) points satisfies @xmath45 and @xmath44 , finally , the squared points satisfy @xmath45 and @xmath46 . for numerical computations we use the code darksusy  @xcite and the code feynhiggs  @xcite , while for the explicit formulas and further details on the experimental constraints we refer the reader to ref .  @xcite .",
    "times the branching ratio of @xmath47 at lhc versus @xmath16 ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "right : scatter plot for the cross section of the process @xmath49 in photon - photon collision at @xmath50 gev .",
    "the light gray ( turquoise ) points have only @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the plus - shaped points dark - gray ( indigo ) points satisfies @xmath45 and @xmath44 , finally , the squared points satisfy @xmath45 and @xmath46 . ]    at high @xmath8 the dominant production mechanisms for @xmath51 at lhc is @xmath52 fusion due to the @xmath53 enhanced @xmath54 couplings .",
    "we calculate the cross section with feynhiggs which uses the approximation @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the total sm cross section for production of higgs boson with mass @xmath57 via @xmath52 fusion : to obtain the value in the mssm it is rescaled with the ratio of the decay width of the inverse process in the mssm over the sm decay width  @xcite .",
    "we calculate for each random model the product the @xmath58 . as masses and couplings of @xmath2 and @xmath3 are practically identical as discussed above , we have @xmath59 .",
    "the scatter plot @xmath58 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , left panel .",
    "we see that with the nominal integrated luminosity of @xmath60 fb@xmath61 per year models which satisfy both the relic density abundance and @xmath62 can give up to 10 events per year ( squared points ) , up to 40 if we relax the condition on the lower limit of @xmath62 ( plus - shaped points ) and up to 200 - 300 relaxing both the lower limits ( turquoise ( light - gray ) points ) .    in @xmath63 collisions the main production mechanism for @xmath64 is @xmath65 fusion while the @xmath52 is suppressed by a factor @xmath66 which can not be compensated by corrections to the @xmath9 yukawa coupling . in ref .",
    "@xcite we studied in detail the @xmath67 fusion process @xmath68 where the higgs boson is produced in the @xmath4-channel via a virtual @xmath67 pair and can be detected from its decay mode @xmath69 .",
    "there we have shown that a good analytical approximation for the cross section is obtained using the equivalent particle approximation wherein the colliding real photons split respectively into @xmath70 and @xmath15 pairs with the subsequent @xmath67 fusion into the higgs boson and that the effect of photons spectra can be neglected .",
    "we thus consider monochromatic photons with @xmath71 gev , and photon - photon luminosity 500 fb@xmath61 yr@xmath61  @xcite .",
    "the scatter plot of the signal cross section versus @xmath16 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , right panel . here",
    "the models which satisfy both the relic density abundance and @xmath62 ( squared points ) have maximal cross section @xmath72 fb , which is too small .",
    "relaxing the lower limits cross section values up to @xmath73 fb are possible , giving 10 events / year .",
    "and @xmath44 , the plus - shaped points dark - gray ( indigo ) points satisfies @xmath45 and @xmath44 , finally , the squared points satisfy @xmath45 and @xmath46 . ]",
    "the spin - independent neutralino - nucleon cross section in the limit of heavy squarks and large @xmath8 can be approximated as  @xcite @xmath74 , where @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the lightest neutralino unitary mixing matrix elements , @xmath77 the nucleon mass ( neglecting the mass difference between the neutron and the proton ) and @xmath78 a factor which depends on nucleon form factors . the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the scatter plot for the spin - independent neutralino - nucleon cross section as a function of @xmath79 and the region excluded by cdms  @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that cdf and cdms limits are very mild constraints : the region excluded by cdf is practically excluded by the other constraints while the cdms limit exclude only one plus - shaped point leaving untouched the regions preferred by wmap and the @xmath42 anomaly .",
    "the xenon100 experiment  @xcite should reach the sensitivity corresponding to the dashed gray ( red ) line in the figure  [ fig1 ] , left panel .",
    "such sensitivity is able to cover the region with the highest cross section , @xmath80 gev , where there is large higgsino component . on the other hand",
    "the region preferred by @xmath42 anomaly can not be covered .",
    "we also report the prospected sensitivity goal of the xenon experiment with 1 ton detector mass  @xcite , dot - dashed gray ( red ) line , which is @xmath81 pb for neutralino mass in the range @xmath82 gev : practically all of the parameter space can be probed .",
    "we also present the effect of our constrained parameter space on the flux of photons coming from neutralino annihilation in the halo which is a very active field in indirect dark matter detection .",
    "the flux of gammas expected from neutralino annihilation is generally given by @xmath83 where the second factor contains the astrophysical informations and is given by the integral of the squared of the dark matter density along the direction of observation , while @xmath84 is the particle physics factor given by @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the thermal averaged cross section annihilation times the velocity of neutralinos and the @xmath87 is photon spectrum which is integrated over energies greater than @xmath88 .",
    "here we are interested mainly in the evaluation of the particle physics factor and in comparing it with other other studies in literature in the framework of the mssm .",
    "we present @xmath84 as a function of the neutralino mass in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , right panel , with threshold energy @xmath89 gev . for models with a relic density inside the wmap interval",
    "the maximum value of the particle physics factor is @xmath90 photons gev@xmath91 @xmath92 s@xmath61 for neutralino mass around @xmath93 gev : this value is two order of magnitude smaller than the typical values found in similar studies without the constraints from lepton flavor violation and the updated @xmath33 physics and @xmath42 constraints , see refs .",
    "we remark that most of the models which satisfy the wmap bounds , the plus - shaped and squared points in the figures , satisfy the higgs funnel condition @xmath6 ( see fig .  2 , left panel ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) : the main annihilation channel is @xmath94 through @xmath4-channel heavy higgs exchange which is strongly constrained in our scenario and thus it is natural to have a reduction of photons emission . a reduction of the gamma ray flux in the funnel region it also found in ref .",
    "@xcite in the study of the minimal supergravity ( msugra ) plus right - handed neutrinos for see - saw generation of neutrino masses respect to the case of pure msugra .",
    "in the framework of the mssm with heavy susy - qcd particles and large @xmath8 we have studied lepton flavor violation in @xmath95 sector mediated by the heavy neutral higgs @xmath96 , @xmath3 at high energy colliders through the production and decay at lhc , @xmath97 , @xmath98 and the @xmath0 fusion at a photon collider , @xmath49 .    we have found that in models with @xmath45 and @xmath99 : at lhc the cross section for @xmath97 , @xmath98 can reach @xmath100 fb in the range @xmath101 gev giving up to 10 events with 100 fb@xmath61 ; the cross section of @xmath49 reaches @xmath102 fb , thus too small even for the large value of the expected luminosity of 500 fb@xmath61 .",
    "prospects are somewhat more encouraging if we relax the lower limits , imposing only @xmath43 and @xmath103 : the cross section at lhc is about 2 fb for low @xmath16 masses and around @xmath73 fb in @xmath63 collisions . on the other hand , to observe such effects , in any case , the full luminosity of the machine is needed .",
    "we have also studied the spin - independent neutralino nucleus cross section : we have shown that in models that satisfy @xmath45 and @xmath99 , the cross section lies just below the sensitivity of xenon100 which should report results soon .",
    "the full xenon 1 ton is needed to cover all the parameter space . for models with a relic density inside the wmap interval the particle physics factor for gamma rays flux from neuralino annihilation in the haloes",
    "is found to be smaller than the typical values found in similar studies without the constraints from lepton flavor violation and the updated @xmath33 physics and @xmath42 constraints .",
