    "b@xmath1  is a strong flat - spectrum radio source which was discovered to be gravitationally lensed by @xcite .",
    "the object consists of two point sources which are radio loud and variable , with similar flat spectra in the radio regime .",
    "in addition to the point sources , there is an einstein ring of 0.33 arcsec diameter .",
    "this object is the smallest known einstein radio ring ( patnaik _ et al . _  1993 ) .",
    "@xcite ( see also cohen",
    "_ et al . _  2000",
    ") have measured a time delay for b@xmath1  of 10.5@xmath2 days .",
    "hst optical images by @xcite and by @xcite and nicmos images by @xcite reveal the lensing galaxy clearly .",
    "b@xmath1  is an extremely important object for studies of gravitational lensing .",
    "the einstein ring provides a strong constraint on the mass distribution in the lens .",
    "the simple source structure and small angular size of b@xmath1 , the constraints from sub - structure in the images which are well mapped with vlbi ( see * ? ? ? * ) , and the apparent absence of significant external shear make this object easier than most to model . as the error on the time delay",
    "is currently estimated to be 3 percent ( 1@xmath3 ) , ( biggs , private communication ) , b@xmath1  is a prime target for determining the hubble constant and so it is vital to obtain secure and accurate lens and source redshifts .    in order to fulfill the promise of b@xmath1  for these purposes , both the source and the lens redshift are required .",
    "@xcite , and independently @xcite , established the redshift of one of these , which they assumed was the lens , as @xmath4 , detecting several emission and absorption features .",
    "subsequently absorption arising in the lensing galaxy has been detected at 21 cm @xcite , in co @xcite , and in formaldehyde @xcite against the background source .",
    "however , not surprisingly , the source redshift for b@xmath1  proved more elusive , since the source is a blazar @xcite .",
    "we therefore started an effort to find the source redshift in 1994 using the low resolution imaging spectrograph @xcite at the keck observatory .",
    "we were able to detect one definite weak emission feature fairly rapidly , but could not find a secure second line . assuming the detected line at 5460  is the 2800   mg ii line , the redshift of the lensed object in b@xmath1  is then @xmath5 , further supporting @xcite and @xcite , who offer @xmath6 as a `` tantalizing possibility , rather than a firm claim '' .",
    "this result was announced at two conferences in 1996 @xcite .",
    "it has taken longer than expected , but we have finally succeeded in detecting with confidence multiple emission lines from the source .",
    "we present in this brief paper the secure redshift of the lensed object in b@xmath1  based on the detection of five broad emission lines , @xmath0 .",
    "in august 1994 , we obtained several exposures with the lris of b@xmath1 , with a total exposure time of 6200 sec .",
    "the 300 g / mm grating was used and the spectra covered the wavelength region 3000 to 7600   ( with no useful signal below 4000 ) . figure  [ fig_blue ] shows the spectrum of b@xmath1  over the central part of this wavelength regime ( from spectra with the same instrumental configuration taken in 1997 ) .",
    "the steep spectral slope is apparent in this figure .",
    "the optical spectrum is fairly red ; @xmath7 , with @xmath8 @xcite . numerous absorption lines and a few emission lines from the lensing galaxy",
    "are clearly seen at the expected redshift , @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "in addition , we found a single broad emission line at @xmath105470  which has absorption components on its blue wing .",
    "we could not find a second emission line within the spectral range covered , and hence the most likely line identification for the detected broad line is mg  ii at 2800 , implying @xmath11 for the lensed object is @xmath100.95 .",
    "if this value is correct , then the next strong emission line to the blue should be ciii ] 1909     expected to be at @xmath103720   , while h@xmath12 should be at about 9500   . since the blue side of lris was not installed until 2001 , looking for the ciii ] line was impossible . searching for the balmer lines was also not trivial because these are likely to be weak broad features , and the night sky emission and absorption will create difficulties , but this was judged the only feasible route .",
    "we took spectra of b@xmath1  in the red in 1995 , 1996 , 1997 and 2000 to hunt for these lines in order to confirm our preliminary redshift .",
    "a number of hot stars ( white dwarfs or rapidly rotating o stars ) selected from @xcite with broad spectral features ( and no strong ones within the red region we use here ) were observed at a similar range of airmass each night to enable removal of terrestrial atmospheric absorption bands .",
    "the object was slightly dithered by several arcsec along the slit between exposures .",
    "the 600 g / mm grating blazed at 7500  was used , with spectral coverage from 7530 to 10,100   . a sophisticated reduction and analysis scheme",
    "was developed , using the laplacian cosmic ray removal algorithm of @xcite , followed by standard figaro scripts @xcite for removing distortions in two dimensions , as well as subtraction of the resulting frames . because both the emission and absorption night sky spectrum are temporally variable ( as well as dependent on airmass )",
    ", this did not result in perfect removal of the night sky emission lines , but it did reduce their intensity by a large factor .",
    "this was followed by a removal of the residual night sky emission and , as well as possible , the night sky absorption .",
    "figure  [ fig_red85 ] shows the region from 7800 to 8650   .",
    "the sum of the 1995 , 1996 and 1997 red spectra of b@xmath1with a total exposure time of 16,500 sec is used .",
    "( several additional spectra of this object taken during that period through thin clouds with lower signal levels were not included . )",
    "the summed spectra have been divided by a spectrum of the da0 white dwarf g191b2b , whose signal level is much higher than that of the spectrum of b@xmath1 .",
    "the spectrum of g191b2b was normalized to the region near 8800   .",
    "prior to this division , the summed , sky - subtracted spectrum of b@xmath1   had @xmath108500 adu / pixel ( with 2 @xmath13/adu ) in the continuum at 8100 , and @xmath102000 adu / pixel in the continuum at 9800 .",
    "regions within the strongest night sky lines are omitted in the figure ; at such points the curve is discontinuous .",
    "this spectral region shows a strong narrow emission line ( h@xmath12 from the lensing galaxy ) plus a weaker broad emission line which we interpret as h@xmath14 in the background source .",
    "the blue wing of the latter is interrupted by the strong 8430  night sky emission line .",
    "the 4959 , 5007    [ oiii ] doublet from the lens is present .",
    "the bluer line of the doublet is slightly to the red of the strong night sky emission line at 8343  ( where the curve is discontinuous ) , while the redder line is mixed in as a sharp peak within the broader h@xmath14 from the background source .",
    "small residuals of features from the night sky are also apparent .    the region of h@xmath12 in the source is shown in figure  [ fig_red95 ] . even though this is a total of 16,500 sec exposure of b@xmath1 , the signal is weak due to the decrease in lris instrumental efficiency at such red wavelengths . as before ,",
    "regions where the night sky emission lines are strong have been omitted .",
    "the spectrum has been divided by an exposure of the hot star g191-b2b to remove atmospheric absorption features normalized as described above . in this spectral region from 9300 to 9500   , the night sky absorption is large and rapidly varying .",
    "regions where the hot star spectrum changed by more than 8%/1.2   ( 1 pixel ) are also omitted .",
    "furthermore , the absorption in the hot star is slightly scaled to better match the absorption in b@xmath1 .",
    "in addition to h@xmath12 , the somewhat narrower , but still broad ( compared to the lines arising from the lens ) lines of the 4959 , 5007    [ oiii ] doublet from the source are apparent .",
    "strong , narrow na d absorption lines from the lens are seen easily in the full spectrum , just redward of the portion shown in figure  [ fig_red95 ] .",
    "table  [ tab_lines ] summarizes the detected lines from both the source and the lens in b@xmath1 . adopting the mean redshift from the four broad emission lines , ( excluding mgii 2800 , which is distorted by absorption features )",
    ", we find @xmath0 for the redshift of the lensed object in b@xmath1 .      since the red spectra have higher spectral resolution , we have used the narrow h@xmath12 emission line in the lens , detected at 8189   , to set an upper limit to the velocity dispersion and/or rotation in the lens galaxy .",
    "the instrumental resolution ( projection of a 1.0 arcsec wide slit ) of lris corresponds at that wavelength to 204 km  s@xmath15 .",
    "we determine an upper limit to the contribution to the fwhm line width from internal motions in the lens galaxy of @xmath16 km  s@xmath15 . @xcite",
    "have studied the relationship between the width of h@xmath12 emission and of 21 cm emission in a sample of galaxies , and find that this ratio has a mean of about 0.7 , presumably because the ionized gas which gives rise to the former is more centrally concentrated within the gravitational potential of the galaxy .",
    "our upper limit is consistent with the measured fwhm of the 21 cm absorption line of @xcite of only 43 km  s@xmath15 .",
    "however , the 21 cm absorption presumably probes only a small pencil beam through the lensing galaxy , and does not sample its full rotation curve .",
    "the spectral features we detect are consistent with the lens being a spiral galaxy .",
    "given the very heavy use the community has made of our preliminary redshift for b@xmath1 , published in 1996 @xcite , it is indeed fortunate that the definitive redshift of @xmath17 presented here confirms our earlier ( educated ) guess .",
    "the entire keck / lris user community owes a huge debt to jerry nelson , gerry smith , bev oke , and many other people who have worked to make the keck telescope and lris a reality and to operate and maintain the keck observatory .",
    "we are grateful to the w. m. keck foundation for the vision to fund the construction of the w. m. keck observatory .",
    "the authors wish to extend special thanks to those of hawaiian ancestry on whose sacred mountain we are privileged to be guests . without their generous hospitality , none of the observations presented herein would have been possible .",
