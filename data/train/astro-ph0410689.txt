    "pg1159 stars are hot hydrogen - deficient ( pre- ) white dwarfs ( @xmath0 between 75000 and 200000k , @xmath1=5.58 ; werner 2001 ) .",
    "they are probably the outcome of a late he - shell flash , a phenomenon that drives the currently observed fast evolutionary rates of three well - known objects ( fg  sge , sakurai s object , v605 aql ) .",
    "flash - induced envelope mixing produces a h - deficient stellar surface ( herwig etal .",
    "the photospheric composition then essentially reflects that of the region between the h- and he - burning shells in the precursor agb star .",
    "the he - shell flash transforms the star back to an agb star ( `` born - again agb star '' ) and the subsequent , second post - agb evolution explains the existence of wolf - rayet central stars of planetary nebulae and their successors , the pg1159 stars .",
    "pg1159 stars provide the unique possibility to study the chemistry in the intershell region between the h- and he - burning shells that is created after complicated and still poorly - understood burning and mixing processes during the agb phase .",
    "usually the intershell material remains hidden within the stellar interior . during the third dredge - up on the agb , however , intershell material can get mixed into the convective surface layer and appears on the stellar surface , though in rather diluted abundances .",
    "nevertheless , this process defines the role of agb stars as contributors of nuclearly processed matter to the galaxy .",
    "our motivation to study pg1159 stars is based on the fact that these objects directly display their intershell matter . however , the quantitative interpretation of the abundance analyses is still premature because evolutionary calculations through a final he - shell flash including a full nuclear network are not available , yet .    before the advent of fuse with its outstanding fuv capabilities we have performed spectral analyses of almost all known pg1159 stars based on optical and hst - uv spectra .",
    "we determined @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and abundances of the dominant elements , namely he , c , and o. typical values are he=33% , c=50% , o=17%",
    "( by mass ) .",
    "traces of nitrogen ( 1% ) or considerable amounts of residual hydrogen ( about 25% ) were found in a few stars , and in a few cases , optical as well as chandra x - ray identifications of neon were successful ( 2% ) .",
    "generally , fuse spectra of pg1159 stars show only few photospheric ( absorption ) lines , mainly from heii , civ , ovi , and nevii .",
    "some of them show shallow nv lines and in many of them we see sulfur .",
    "the svi 933/944  doublet in k1 - 16 suggests a solar abundance , which is in line with the expectation that s is not affected by the s - process .",
    "we also identify silicon in some objects ( reiff etal .",
    "2005 ) , but detailed abundance analyses remain to be done .    the first surprising result of fuse spectroscopy was the detection of a significant iron deficiency ( 12 dex ) in the three best studied pg1159 stars ( miksa etal .",
    "apparently , fe was transformed to heavier elements in the intershell region of the agb star by n - captures from the neutron source @xmath2c(@xmath3,n)@xmath4o ( herwig etal .",
    "subsequently , several other studies have also revealed an fe - deficiency in [ wc ] type central stars ( see werner etal .",
    "2003 ) , which matches our picture that these stars are immediate pg1159 star progenitors .",
    "the next important result was accomplished by the identification of one of the strongest absorption lines seen in fuse spectra of most pg1159 stars , located at 973.3 .",
    "it is a nevii line ( fig.1 ) that allowed to assess the neon abundance in a large sample of objects ( werner etal .",
    "it turns out that neon is strongly overabundant , ( 2% , i.e. , 20 times solar ) .",
    "this result clearly confirms the idea that pg1159 stars indeed exhibit intershell matter .",
    "neon is produced in the he - burning environment by two @xmath3-captures of nitrogen , which itself resulted from previous cno burning : @xmath5n@xmath6f@xmath7o@xmath8ne .",
    "there are still at least ten photospheric lines in the fuse spectra of pg1159 stars that remain unidentified .",
    "some of them may stem from yet unknown nevii lines .",
    "the latest identification is a feature at 1139.5 , which appears rather strong in some objects .",
    "we found that it is a line from highly ionized fluorine ( fig.1 ) and derived large overabundances ( up to 250 times solar ) for a number of pg1159 stars .",
    "we also could identify this line in `` normal '' h - dominated central stars and , in contrast , find about solar fluorine abundances ( werner etal .",
    "this again is a clear proof that we see intershell matter on pg1159 stars . according to recent calculations by lugaro etal .",
    "( 2004 ) , their stellar models show an effective fluorine production and storage in the intershell , leading to abundances that are comparable to the observed pg1159 abundances of fluorine .",
    "the general problem for fluorine production is that @xmath9f , the only stable f isotope , is rather fragile and readily destroyed in hot stellar interiors by hydrogen via @xmath9f(p,@xmath3)@xmath4o and helium via @xmath9f(@xmath3,p)@xmath10ne .",
    "the nucleosynthesis path for f production in he - burning environments of agb and wolf - rayet stars is @xmath5n(@xmath3,@xmath11)@xmath12f(@xmath13)@xmath12o(p,@xmath3)@xmath14n(@xmath3,@xmath11)@xmath9f .",
    "this underlines that agb stars which dredge up material from the intershell are contributing to the galactic f content ( together with wolf - rayet stars and type  ii sne ) .",
    "this is completely in line with the detected f overabundances ( up to 30 times solar ) found in agb stars ( jorissen etal .",
    "to what extent pg1159 stars themselves return f to the ism remains to be estimated .",
    "the life time of a born - again agb star is short in comparison to a usual agb star , however , the f fraction in the mass lost by a wind of the former is much higher ."
