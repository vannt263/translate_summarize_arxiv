    "three - nucleon ( 3n ) forces come more and more into the focus of few - nucleon studies .",
    "pure 3n continuum measurements at the accelerator facilities iucf  @xcite , kvi  @xcite , riken  @xcite and rcnp  @xcite are performed around 100 - 200 mev nucleon laboratory energies with the aim to confront data to theoretical predictions based on modern high - precision nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) forces only  @xcite .",
    "clear - cut discrepancies for certain 3n observables against all those predictions can be considered to be good candidates for 3n force ( 3nf ) effects .",
    "thereby the theoretical investigations are based on numerically precise solutions of the 3n faddeev equations . then adding present day 3nf models and comparing to those data one tries to explore their strength and spin structure  @xcite .",
    "right now these 3nf models are the 2@xmath1-exchange tucson melbourne ( tm )  @xcite , a modified version thereof , tm",
    "@xcite , which is closer to chiral symmetry , and the urbana  ix  @xcite forces .",
    "another path to learn about 3nf s is the study of the low lying spectra of light nuclei as performed in greens function monte carlo calculations  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of 3@xmath1-exchange ring diagrams with intermediate @xmath2 s on top of the urbana ix 3nf appears to be rather promising to improve the theoretical description of the spectra  @xcite . in all those investigations there",
    "is clear evidence found that present day nn forces alone fail to describe many of the studied observables and adding the presently available three- nucleon force models moves theory in the right direction .",
    "a recent approach towards nuclear dynamics is based on chiral perturbation theory , which is closely linked to qcd and develops nuclear forces in a systematic and controlled manner  @xcite . in that scheme which treats multi- pion exchanges",
    "explicitly and incorporates short range processes in the form of contact forces of increasing chiral dimensions also 3n forces are predicted and this consistently to nn forces . in",
    "@xcite it has been demonstrated that like in the conventional approaches mentioned above 3n forces are unavoidable to predict binding energies of three- and four- nucleon nuclei as well as to remove discrepancies in certain 3n scattering observables .",
    "electromagnetically induced reactions in the 3n system should also show effects of 3nf s . since",
    "both 3n bound and scattering states enter into the nuclear matrix elements for photon induced processes and both types of states are affected by 3n forces it would be surprising if the various response functions for these reactions would be unaffected . in principle just by the continuity equation 3n forces lead also unavoidably to 3n currents .",
    "it is a quantitative question based on current choices of nuclear force models to reveal signatures by switching on and off 3n forces .",
    "if certain observables are linked to binding energies and if all modern nn forces including the most recent ones based on chiral perturbation theory are unable to predict the experimental bound state energies but the inclusion of 3n forces is , we leave it to the reader to decide whether the changes in those observables are called 3n force effects or just binding effects . apparently under these circumstances both",
    "are tightly bound together .",
    "it is only with oversimplified toy model nn forces which do not describe the rich nn data set that possibly experimental bound state energies can be achieved .",
    "conclusions based on those models should be taken with caution .",
    "the search for three- nucleon force effects in electromagnetically induced processes has been started before . for recent references",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to investigate the nucleon - deuteron ( nd ) photodisintegration of @xmath0he and @xmath0h as well as the time reversed proton - deuteron ( pd ) capture process using modern nn forces and various 3nf models .",
    "the single nucleon current operator is supplemented by exchange currents either in the form of the siegert approximation or by explicitly including mec s of the @xmath1- and @xmath3-like nature .",
    "the treatment is carried through nonrelativistically , though presumably some of the data that we analyze , require at least relativistic corrections .",
    "two - body photodisintegration of @xmath0he ( @xmath0h ) has a long history .",
    "barbour and phillips   found that the incorporation of the interacting 3n continuum is crucial for the understanding of that process .",
    "they solved the 3n faddeev equations , at that time of course based on simple finite rank forces .",
    "this was taken up again more consistently by gibson and lehman   treating the 3n bound state and the final 3n continuum on equal footing .",
    "more recently the bonn group  @xcite used more modern nn forces represented in finite rank form .",
    "they analyzed quite a few data and pointed out a correlation of a certain cross section peak height with the triton binding energy , an issue which we shall also address but now in the context of 3nf effects .",
    "all the work mentioned relied on the siegert approximation .",
    "the current was restricted to the dominant @xmath4 multipole  @xcite or to the @xmath4 and @xmath5 multipoles  @xcite . in a recent paper  @xcite a benchmark",
    "was set on the total 3n photodisintegration cross section . there",
    "two quite different approaches , the faddeev one and a hyperspherical harmonic expansion together with the lorentz integral transform method were compared to each other using av18 together with urbana ix and reached a very good agreement .",
    "this documents the technical maturity of advanced present day approaches .",
    "also for the pd capture process many experimental and theoretical studies have been performed in the past .",
    "we refer to @xcite for references .",
    "specifically we want to point to the theoretical investigations by schadow _",

    "@xcite .",
    "the present investigation is restricted to nucleon- deuteron fragmentations in relation to @xmath0he ( @xmath0h ) and we refer to a forthcoming study for 3n fragmentations .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we briefly review our formalism and the dynamical ingredients .",
    "our results for nd photodisintegration are presented in sec .",
    "iii together with available data .",
    "the pd capture observables are discussed in sec .",
    "we summarize in sec .",
    "we evaluated photodisintegration and pd capture before in  @xcite and  @xcite , always using faddeev - like integral equations . in  @xcite we formulated pd capture based on nn forces alone . there",
    "the faddeev - like integral equation is identical to the one for nd scattering .",
    "this is because in pd capture the 3n scattering state @xmath6 enters directly . on the other hand in @xmath0he photodisintegration",
    "the 3n scattering state @xmath7 is involved like in electrodisintegration of @xmath0he .",
    "the way to derive faddeev - like integral equations in the latter cases is to apply the adjoint moeller wave operator entering the nuclear matrix element to the right , namely onto the electromagnetic current operator and the @xmath0he bound state  @xcite .",
    "this has the very big advantage that the driving term of that faddeev - type integral equation is fully connected , namely proportional to the @xmath0he bound state . because of the formal identity of the nuclear matrix elements for photodisintegration and electron induced processes the same faddeev - like integral equation is applicable . in the two cases only the components of the current operator in the driving term have to be chosen appropriately . now using time reversal symmetry one can relate the matrix elements for pd capture and photodisintegration , which are evaluated quite differently",
    "this is a highly nontrivial numerical test for the various complex numerical steps involved .    in  @xcite",
    "we added a 3nf in the evaluation of the pd capture process and applied it to cross sections and several spin observables .",
    "the formalism was straightforward since we could use directly the faddeev - like integral equation for nd scattering including 3n forces as derived in  @xcite .",
    "in the same paper  @xcite we compared siegert approximation to the explicit use of a restricted but possibly dominant set of mesonic exchange currents .",
    "now for two- and three - body photodisintegration we would also like to formulate an extension including 3n forces .",
    "we shall proceed as follows .",
    "the nuclear matrix element for nd - photodisintegration of a 3n bound state has the following form    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the asymptotic relative momentum between the proton and the deuteron , and @xmath10 is the component of the 3n current operator .",
    "the scattering state @xmath11 can be faddeev decomposed    @xmath12    where @xmath13 , according to our standard notation  @xcite , is the sum of a cyclical and anticyclical permutation .",
    "the faddeev amplitude @xmath14 obeys the faddeev equation  @xcite    @xmath15    here the channel state @xmath16 enters , which is a product of a deuteron wave function and a momentum eigenstate of the remaining nucleon , the nn t - operator @xmath17 acting on nucleons 2 and 3 , the free 3n propagator @xmath18 , the permutation operator @xmath13 and @xmath19 , the part of a 3n force , which singles out particle 1 . for our notation see  @xcite and @xcite .    using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : n ] ) , ( [ eq : decomp ] ) and ( [ eq : fad ] ) we can write the nuclear matrix element as    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the kernel of the integral equation  ( [ eq : fad ] ) . we introduce    @xmath22    or explicitly the integral equation @xmath23 this form is not yet suitable for numerical applications because of the presence of @xmath13 to the very left .",
    "this has already been noted at the very beginning of our numerical 3n studies using nuclear forces without finite rank representations  @xcite . to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : u2 ] ) into a suitable form we use the following obvious identities    @xmath24    @xmath25    and obtain    @xmath26    this faddeev - like integral equation is suitable for numerical implementations and has the form    @xmath27    with    @xmath28    then the nuclear matrix element results as @xmath29 in view of a forthcoming paper we also describe now the treatment of the complete 3n break - up process . the nuclear matrix element is    @xmath30    the asymptotic momenta of the three nucleons are given by standard jacobi momenta @xmath31 and @xmath9  @xcite . the faddeev amplitude corresponding to the scattering state in eq .",
    "( [ eq : n3n ] ) is now defined via    @xmath32    where @xmath21 is the same kernel as used before in eq .",
    "( 3 ) and    @xmath33    it is to be noted that the free two - body subsystem state in @xmath34 is properly antisymmetrized . here",
    "@xmath34 is the free 3n state .",
    "following the same steps as above one ends up with    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is as given above .    in the actual numerical calculation we used",
    ", however , another form , which for the purpose of completeness , we would also like to present here .",
    "the reason for that is that at the time of the installation , the very heavy numerical tasks were more easily performed with already existing building blocks .",
    "that alternative forms are for the nd - break up    @xmath37    and for the 3n break up    @xmath38    the faddeev - like integral equation for @xmath39 reads then    @xmath40    the equivalence between the matrix elements ( [ eq : n3 ] ) and ( [ eq : n3nn ] ) on the one hand and ( [ eq : nnew ] ) and ( [ eq : n3new ] ) on the other hand is demonstrated as follows . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : utilde ] ) and ( [ eq : uprime ] ) we have    @xmath41    using again eq .",
    "( [ eq : p1 ] ) and the form of the kernel @xmath21 this is    @xmath42    thus    @xmath43    now it is a simple task to verify that the two expressions for the 3n break - up amplitude ( 16 ) and ( 18 ) are identical .",
    "this is also true for the two nd break - up amplitudes ( 12 ) and ( 17 ) .",
    "it is efficient to evaluate also the pd capture process using time reversal in terms of the formalism just described .",
    "this is what we do in this paper .",
    "we use the av18 nn force  @xcite combined with the urbana  ix 3n force  @xcite . by construction",
    "that force combination describes the @xmath0h binding energy correctly .",
    "it overbinds however slightly the @xmath0he bound state energy by 21 kev  @xcite . for the convenience of the reader",
    "we cite the theoretical binding energies : -7.628 mev for @xmath0h and av18 alone , -8.48 by construction including urbana ix , -6.917 mev for @xmath0he and av18 together with the coulomb force and -7.739 mev including in addition urbana ix .",
    "the latter value is to be compared to the experimental value -7.718 mev which is slightly different , but this should be of no significance for the present studies .",
    "unfortunately we are still unable to include the coulomb force into the pd continuum , which causes an inconsistency of unknown magnitude . of course at least for the higher energies studied in this paper we expect minor coulomb force effects as it is supported by pure pd scattering investigations  @xcite .",
    "our calculations are fully converged by choosing total two- nucleon angular momenta up to @xmath45=3 and total 3n angular momenta up to @xmath46= 15/2 .",
    "it turned out to be sufficient to keep the 3n force different from zero for total 3n angular momenta up to @xmath47= 7/2 .",
    "the standard nonrelativistic form of the single nucleon current operator  @xcite is supplemented by exchange currents via the siegert approximation .",
    "we use it in the form as detailed in  @xcite . in our treatment electric and magnetic multipoles",
    "are kept to a very high order ( 67 ) and no long wave length approximation is used .",
    "both ingredients are important as has been shown for instance in  @xcite .",
    "the formalism is performed throughout in momentum space . as is well known the siegert approach corrects for many body currents only in the electric multipoles .",
    "available models for two- body currents should then be added for the magnetic multipoles .",
    "this , however , is not yet included in this work .",
    "on the other hand we also use explicit exchange currents of the @xmath1- and @xmath3- like type consistent to the av18 nn force .",
    "again this is not yet a complete approach since further pieces in the av18 nn force have no counterparts in two - body currents which would be also required to fulfill the continuity equation .",
    "this needs further investigations  @xcite , though the expectations are that with the @xmath1- and @xmath3- like parts the dominant currents are taken into account .",
    "if the continuity equation would be fulfilled in relation to all parts of av18 the siegert approach with respect to the electric multipoles would be essentially equivalent to these explicit mec s ( except of additional 3n force effects included in the siegert approach and less important terms of higher multipolarities , see  @xcite ) .",
    "our aim here is not to forward the theory of the electromagnetic current operator but to apply what is often called `` the standard model of nuclear physics '' to the complex 2-body photodisintegration or pd capture processes , which has not been done before to the best of our knowledge .",
    "we show in fig.[fig1 ] the angular distribution for pd photodisintegration of @xmath0he against the angle between the outgoing deuteron and the incoming photon direction in the laboratory system .",
    "the photon energies @xmath48 vary between 10 and 140 mev . at the two lower energies the cross section maximum",
    "is decreased by adding the 3nf .",
    "a related effect has been seen before in  @xcite using different nn forces .",
    "thereby it was found , that with increasing binding energy the value of the maximum decreased .",
    "this can be considered as a scaling behavior with the 3n binding energy .",
    "it ceases to be valid for the higher energies , where the results including the 3n force overtake the ones without . at",
    "about @xmath48= 28 mev the 3n force effects for the process @xmath49 in that observable vanish . in relation to that scaling at low energies one can ask the question whether the 3n force contributions in the continuum are critical for that result . to that aim we performed calculations where we switched off the 3n force in the continuum but kept it in the @xmath0he bound state .",
    "thereby the @xmath0he binding energy did not change .",
    "( note this is not a consistent calculation and necessarily induces spurious effects ) .",
    "the effect is a decrease of the cross section of about @xmath50 at e@xmath51=100 mev in relation to the difference of the results when the 3n force is dropped totally . at e@xmath51=10 mev",
    "the presence or absence of the 3nf in the continuum had only a very tiny effect .",
    "nevertheless we would like to repeat that the correct binding energy could only be achieved by adding the 3nf to the current most modern nn forces . in  @xcite",
    "energy weighted sum rules for the a=3 photodisintegration cross sections based on the electric dipole operator have been investigated .",
    "they link the energy dependence of the cross section through the integrals to expectation values of the ground state wavefunctions , which are affected by the 3n forces and consequently depend on the binding energy .",
    "it appears worthwhile to check the assumptions and approximations in  @xcite from the point of view of present day forces , wavefunctions and currents .",
    "have these effects already been seen in some data ?",
    "we are aware of cross section data at the deuteron laboratory and c.m .",
    "angles of 90  @xmath52 as a function of @xmath48@xcite .",
    "they are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] in comparison to our theoretical results .",
    "we see the crossing of the theoretical curves without and with 3nf s around 25 mev and indeed the data support the decrease of the cross section at lower energy values as predicted by including the 3nf . at higher energies the effects of the 3nf appear to be somewhat too strong in case of the ticcioni _",
    "data  @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the overshooting of the theory at the lowest energies is partially due to the neglection of the pd coulomb force effects in the continuum .",
    "precise new data would be very welcome .    for @xmath48= 120 mev and higher photon energies we are aware of another set of data for that process  @xcite .",
    "the deuteron laboratory angle is 103  @xmath52 now . in this case",
    "the addition of the 3nf is clearly supported by the data .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . in this case",
    "we used the explicit @xmath1- and @xmath3- like mec s since the energies are higher and siegert as a low energy approximation is less suited .",
    "there are also total nd and pd cross section data for the processes @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we show them in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and  [ fig5 ] based on the siegert approach .",
    "clearly the old data for the nd cross section have too big error bars to be conclusive . in the case of the pd cross section",
    "the inclusion of the 3nf s deteriorates the agreement somewhat for the low photon energies .",
    "the nd cross section data have been displayed before in  @xcite .",
    "summarizing , the comparison with the angular distribution data appears to be in qualitative agreement .",
    "new improved data would be welcome and a more refined treatment of two - body currents is required .    in order to provide information on the dependence of the cross sections on the choice of forces and currents we display in table  i results for the total two - body photodisintegration cross section of @xmath0he ( @xmath0h ) at three energies . at 12 mev",
    "we see 5 % ( 10 % ) spreads with ( without ) 3nf s . at the higher energies the spreads are negligible which points to a certain stability of the results and",
    "helps to identify 3n force effects .",
    "precise data , however , would be required .",
    "in ref .  @xcite cross sections and spin observables for pd capture have been investigated at proton laboratory energies @xmath55 between 5 and 200  mev ( corresponding to deuteron laboratory energies @xmath56 between 10 and 400  mev ) .",
    "the emphasis was on testing the sensitivity of pd capture observables to changes in the choice of nn forces and to compare the predictions of the siegert approximation to the ones including explicitly @xmath1- and @xmath3-like mec s .",
    "please note as pointed out above that both approaches in the way we treat them are approximate and therefore the comparison is more of qualitative nature .",
    "we found that at low energies siegert and mec predictions are rather close together , whereas at the higher energies differences showed up . in the context of the siegert approach the predictions based on different nn forces turned out to be rather close together , which is a satisfactory result , since it demonstrates stability",
    "the agreement with the data was mostly good , but also clear discrepancies were present , which call for an improvement of the dynamical input .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to include 3nf s , which in the previous work were only marginally investigated .    in the following",
    "we show our results for cross sections between @xmath56= 19.8 mev and @xmath56= 400  mev . in all of the following figures",
    "four theoretical curves are displayed .",
    "they are based on the siegert approach , the single nucleon current together with explicit @xmath1- and @xmath3-like mec s consistent to the nn force , the siegert with 3nf and mec`s with 3nf .",
    "let us denote these four choices by a , b , a ' and b , for short .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] the pd capture cross section at @xmath56 = 19.8 mev . in both cases , siegert and explicit mec s ,",
    "the inclusion of the 3nf decreases the cross section ; in case of siegert the decrease is much stronger .",
    "the choices a , b and b are well within the error bars and only a is significantly too high . at @xmath56",
    "= 95 mev the cross section data are fairly well described by all four choices .",
    "this is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . as already seen in the nd photodisintegration the theoretical cross section increases by including 3nf s .",
    "this is in agreement with our findings for pd capture  @xcite .",
    "finally we show the cross sections for @xmath55= 100 , 150 and 200 mev ( corresponding to @xmath56= 200 , 300 and 400 mev ) in fig .",
    "the cases with the explicit mec s and 3n forces ( b ) describe the data best ( except for small angles ) . the choice a clearly underpredicts the maxima .",
    "we presented the formalisms for including 3nf s into the faddeev framework for photodisintegration of three nucleon bound states .",
    "the resulting equations are solved rigorously using high precision nuclear forces : av18 together with the urbana  ix 3nf or cd bonn with tm 3nf .",
    "many - body currents are included either in the form of @xmath1- and @xmath3-like exchanges related to av18 or via the siegert approach where the latter corrects only electric multipoles for many body currents and the former does not include all two - body currents consistent to av18 ( in the sense of fulfilling the continuity equation ) .",
    "thus both ways of going beyond the single nucleon current are approximate but currently used in the literature .",
    "the calculations are nonrelativistic but employ state of the art dynamics .",
    "we posed several questions .",
    "how well do the siegert approach and the explicit use of the @xmath1- and @xmath3-like mec s compare with each other ?",
    "our results displayed for pd capture show differences between the two approaches which calls for improvements either by adding two - body currents for the magnetic multipoles in the siegert approach or by adding at least the currents beyond the @xmath1- and @xmath3-like parts required for the consistency to av18 .",
    "qualitatively , however , the two approaches give similar results .",
    "another even more central question in that paper was to shed light on possible 3nf effects . in case of pd photodisintegration of @xmath0he",
    "we compared theoretical predictions without and with a 3nf .",
    "we found a clear signature in adding the 3nf .",
    "the maxima are decreased at low energies and increased at high energies .",
    "the turning point is around e@xmath51=28 mev . at the low energies this can be considered as a scaling effect with the @xmath0he binding energy but one has to note that based on present day nn forces the @xmath0he binding energy",
    "can only be achieved if a 3nf is added .",
    "these 3n force effects up to about 60 mev are too small to be verified by the presently available data .",
    "however at the lower energies e@xmath51 about 10 mev our theoretical predictions including 3n forces are clearly too high which might be due to the neglected coulomb force in the continuum . at the higher energies e@xmath57mev the effects are larger and qualitatively supported by the data .",
    "one should , however , be aware that beyond the @xmath1-threshold we certainly leave the validity of our nonrelativistic framework . in case of",
    "the pd capture at the higher energies , e@xmath51=100 mev and above , explicit use of mec s together with the 3n force model shows a tendency to move theory better towards the data than without 3n forces .",
    "the failure at the smaller angles shows however that some ingredients are missing .",
    "overall we demonstrated that 3nf s can be incorporated into such a complex 3n reaction process and effects are visible related to the models used .",
    "an improved theoretical treatment of many - body currents and more precise data are needed to achieve a clearer view towards 3n force effects .",
    "altogether the shifts caused by the urbana  ix 3nf on top of the av18 nn force and explicit mec s is supported by most of the data we analyzed .",
    "the siegert approach is less successful .",
    "the use of other force combinations as exemplified in the total two - body photodisintegration cross section does not lead to alarming variations .",
    "high quality data would be very helpful to challenge theory more strongly .",
