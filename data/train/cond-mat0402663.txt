    "models of interacting electrons in one spatial dimension are very valuable for the understanding of strongly correlated systems .",
    "this is because there exist theoretical methods enabling us to determine their physical properties reliably .",
    "indeed , by combining perturbative renormalization group@xcite , bosonization , and bethe ansatz techniques , a wealth of interesting phases in one dimension has been discovered .    while some properties of these phases are unique in one dimension , others have their higher dimensional analogs . for example the independent gapless spin- and charge- excitations and the vanishing quasiparticle weight of the _ luttinger liquid _ @xcite are unique in 1d .",
    "however , the fact that it has a finite charge compressibility and drude weight is analogous to a normal metal in higher dimensions . as another example , like systems in higher dimensions , a mott insulating state is realized at half filling for repulsive interactions .",
    "however , the fact that antiferromagnetic long range order is absent and that spin 1/2 excitation exists in the half - filled mott state are special features of 1d .",
    "furthermore , in one dimension there exists a phase , the _ luther - emery liquid _",
    "@xcite , which exhibits a spin gap and no charge gap .",
    "in addition , as in the _ luttinger liquid _ , the dc electric conductivity is infinite .",
    "the above characteristics suggest that the _ luther - emery liquid _ is a 1d analog of a superconductor .",
    "however , up until very recently an important question remained unanswered : `` do electrons pair in the _ luther - emery liquid _ ? ''",
    "the best way to answer that question is to determine whether the magnetic flux period is @xmath3 or @xmath1.@xcite however , since the spin and charge degrees of freedom are manifestly separate in the effective theory describing the _ luther - emery liquid _ , and the vector potential enters only in the charge action , it is difficult to see why the flux period for a _ luttinger liquid _ and a _ luther - emery liquid _ should be different .",
    "+ in a recent paper we addressed these issues in the one - dimensional @xmath4-@xmath5-@xmath6-model in the limit of vanishing exchange couplings .",
    "@xcite fortunately , both a spin gapless phase as well as a spin gapful phase appear in this limit.@xcite in ref .",
    "we have demonstrated that while the flux period is @xmath7 in the former@xcite , it indeed becomes @xmath1 in the latter .",
    "in particular we have shown that as a function of the aharonov - bohm flux , the ground state energy of a spin gapped ring is periodic with period @xmath1 .",
    "due to one - dimensionality the energy barrier between adjacent minima is proportional to the inverse circumference @xmath2 of the ring . for definiteness",
    ", we therefore define the function [ eq1 ] ( ) = _ ll ( e_0()-e_0(0 ) ) where @xmath8 is the ground state energy of the system as function of flux .    despite the above progress ,",
    "the question `` do all _ luther - emery liquids _ exhibit an @xmath1 flux period , and hence electron pairing ? '' remains to be answered . in this paper , we show that the answer to the above question is indeed affirmative .",
    "technically we start from the luttinger hamiltonian with the @xmath9 channel scattering.@xcite we bosonize this model using the constructive formalism @xcite which provides rigorous operator identities on the hilbert space of the finite size system .",
    "we show that due to a set of constraints on the total charge / spin number / current operators@xcite , the state of the spin sector impacts the charge sector through a twisting of the boundary condition . as a result , when the spin sector is gapped by the large momentum transfer two body scattering ,",
    "the charge channel flux period becomes @xmath1 .",
    "+ in the literature , the fact that there exist constraints on the total charge / current operators in bosonization has been employed by loss@xcite for spinless fermion systems to study particle number parity effects . regarding spinful fermions , ref .",
    "used a method similar to ours to determine the flux period for the hubbard model .",
    "however , the author concluded that the flux period is always @xmath1 regardless of whether a spin gap exists , which we believe to be in error .",
    "furthermore , a common reasoning encountered in the literature is to attribute the @xmath1 flux period to the dominance of singlet superconducting ( ss ) correlations at long distance and low energy , rather than to the appearance of a spin gap .",
    "it has , however , been noted that states with dominant charge density wave ( cdw ) correlations may also feature this anomalous flux period ( see , e. g. , refs . ) .",
    "here we argue that this is just the case when there is a spin gap . in this case",
    ", it is natural to interpret the state as being formed by cooper pairs .",
    "the degree of coherence of these pairs will determine if the state is more appropriately thought of as cdw - like or ss - like on not too large length scales .",
    "in this picture , one naturally expects the flux period to be one half of a flux quantum . in the following",
    ", we will show that regardless of the correlation functions in the charge sector , the existence of a spin gap _ alone",
    "_ indeed causes the @xmath1 flux period in systems with even particle number .   + the structure of this paper is as follows : in section [ geology ] we present the luttinger model with large momentum scattering and state the selection rules between charge and current quantum numbers that characterize its hilbert space . in section [ bosonize ]",
    "we briefly review the formalism of constructive bosonization and introduce some notation . in section [ proof ]",
    "we complete the proof that the flux period will be @xmath1 in the presence of a spin gap , and contrast this behavior with that expected in the spin gapless case for even and odd particle number .",

    "<S> , we show that for systems with a spin gap but with gapless charge degrees of freedom , the ground state energy has an exact period of @xmath1 , i. e. _ half _ a flux quantum , in the limit of large system size @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> finite size corrections are found to vanish exponentially in @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is contrasted to that of the spin gapless case , for both even and odd particle number . </S>",
    "<S> generalizations to finite temperature are also discussed . </S>"
