    "this procedure has been followed with very promising results in the works reviewed in the next sec .",
    "[ sec_results ] .    here , in order to illustrate the efficiency of approximate wavefunction methods to treat @xmath76 , we thus proceed as follows  @xcite .",
    "we first construct , for each @xmath66 , the model hamiltonian @xmath129 using an accurate potential @xmath130  @xcite and compute accurately its ground - state energy , @xmath131 , at the multi - reference configuration interaction with singles and doubles ( mrcisd ) level .",
    "we then compute various approximate ground - state energies , @xmath132 , by using approximate configuration inteaction ( ci ) type wave functions @xmath133 expanded into linear combinations of all the few slater determinants generated from small orbital spaces @xmath134 .",
    "the orbitals used are the natural orbitals of the coulombic system calculated at the mrcisd level .",
    "the accuracy of the approximation for @xmath133 can be assessed by looking at the difference between @xmath135 and @xmath136 @xmath137    the differences @xmath138 are plotted as a function of @xmath66 in fig .",
    "[ fig_ci_he ] for the he atom with the orbital spaces @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "one sees that , in the coulombic limit , @xmath142 , the reduction of the orbital space leads to important errors in the energy . when @xmath66 is decreased , i.e. when the interaction is reduced , the errors due to limited orbital spaces get smaller and smaller . for instance , at @xmath143 , using only the single - determinant wave function @xmath144 , leads to an error @xmath145 of less than @xmath146 hartree .",
    "the case of the be atom with the orbital spaces @xmath140 and @xmath141 is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig_ci_be ] . because of the near - degeneracy of the @xmath147 and @xmath148 levels , the inclusion of @xmath148 configurations in the wave function is important , quite independently of the electron - electron interaction .",
    "indeed , the difference @xmath149 remains large for almost all @xmath66 s . on the contrary , the error of the calculation where the @xmath148 orbitals are included , @xmath150 , quickly falls off when @xmath66 is decreased .",
    "again , for @xmath143 for instance , the error @xmath150 given by the few - determinant ci - type wave function @xmath151 is less than @xmath146 hartree .",
    "therefore , the modification of the interaction enables to increase the accuracy of ci - type wave function calculations , or equivalently for a fixed target accuracy , decrease the effort of the calculation by reducing the orbital space . the crucial point for this effect to appear seems to be the reduction of the electron - electron interaction compared to the coulomb interaction rather than the long - range character of the modified interaction .     where @xmath76 is an accurate wave function and @xmath133 are approximate wave functions generated from small orbital spaces @xmath139 , @xmath140 and @xmath141 , as a function of @xmath66 for the he atom .",
    "]     where @xmath76 is an accurate wave function and @xmath133 are approximate wave functions generated from small orbital spaces @xmath140 and @xmath141 , as a function of @xmath66 for the be atom . ]",

    "( [ eq_fmu ] ) has been explored with different techniques to compute the wavefunction @xmath76 , and using different approximations for the functionals of sec .",
    "[ sec_functionals ] .",
    "we review very briefly some of the corresponding results .",
    "the lda functional for @xmath93 $ ] has been combined with configuration interaction ( ci ) to handle the wavefunction @xmath76 in refs .",
    "@xcite ; the method has been applied to atoms and small molecules . again using lda for the short - range functional , in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that long - range van der waals forces in rare gas dimers can be well described by using second - order perturbation theory for @xmath76 .",
    "a short - range gga functional has been combined with the coupled - cluster ( cc ) method to describe @xmath76 , with very good results for small molecules , both for the closed and the open shell cases  @xcite : in particular , the results from multideterminantal dft for small and medium basis - set sizes are better of both the pure dft result and the pure cc result . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a different gga functional  @xcite has been used , and @xmath76 has been determined by multi - configuration self consitent field ( mcscf ) . the corresponding application to systems in which near - degeneracy effects play a major role is promising , although self - interaction errors in the functionals are still a problem in some cases  @xcite .",
    "realistic @xmath116 from eqs .",
    "( [ eq_eff ] ) have been generated for two - electron atoms in ref .",
    "@xcite : with a very simple approximation for @xmath120 ( inspired to the one used for the electron gas at @xmath125 ) , extremely accurate @xmath93 $ ] have been obtained .",
    "this new strategy of producing functionals is still at a very early stage , and several steps are needed for its development . in particular , we need better approximations for @xmath120 , and the implementation of an efficient algorithm to couple the radial equations ( [ eq_eff ] ) with the method used to solve the model hamiltonian @xmath75 .    in conclusions , changing",
    "the model hamiltonian in dft calculations seems to be a promising alternative to the construction of better exchange - correlation functionals for standard kohn - sham dft .",
    "of course , the method has been under development only in the last decade , and it still needs further improvement and investigation in many aspects .",

    "<S> the formalism of kohn and sham uses a specific ( model ) hamiltonian which highly simplifies the many - electron problem to that of noninteracting fermions . </S>",
    "<S> the theorem of hohenberg and kohn tells us that , for a given ground state density , this hamiltonian is unique . in principle , this density can be chosen as that of the real , interacting system . to obtain the energy , or other properties of the real system , </S>",
    "<S> approximations are needed . working with non interacting fermions </S>",
    "<S> is an important simplification , but it may be easier to produce approximations with different choices of the model hamiltonian . the feature that the exact density is ( ideally ) reproduced can be kept in the newly defined fictitious systems . using model hamiltonians having the same form as the physical one , </S>",
    "<S> that is , being built of one- and two - body operators , allows to approach the physical hamiltonian arbitrarily close , and thus a systematic reduction of the approximations . </S>"
