    "it also might happen that the projection onto the field state @xmath60 in the first cavity is unsuccessful .",
    "this takes place with probability @xmath151 .",
    "finally , it is possible that both projections in the first and second cavity fail with probability @xmath152 .",
    "summing all these failure probabilities leads to @xmath153 .",
    "we have presented a proposal of an unambiguous bell measurement on two atomic qubits with almost unit - fidelity . the theoretical description of the scheme involves the resonant two - atom tavis - cummings model and a ramsey - type sequential interaction of both atoms with single modes of the electromagnetic field in two spatially separated cavities . the first and second cavities are initially prepared in coherent states @xmath42 and @xmath78 respectively .",
    "the interaction time can be adjusted by controlling the velocities of the two atoms passing trough the cavities .",
    "our discussion has concentrated on basic properties of the two - atom tavis - cummings model in the limit of high photon numbers .",
    "we have derived an approximate solution of the dynamical equation which is expressed as a sum of three terms correlating atomic and field states .",
    "a superposition of two atomic bell states is correlated with the initial coherent state .",
    "superpositions of the other two bell states are correlated with two time dependent field states . in phase space",
    "these time dependent contributions of the field state overlap on the opposite site to the initial coherent state @xmath42 ( @xmath78 ) in the first ( second ) cavity at an interaction time of half the revival time .",
    "for this reason we have proposed projections onto the two coherent states @xmath42 and @xmath60 in the first cavity , and @xmath78 and @xmath80 in the second cavity . in order to obtain almost unit fidelity atomic bell states the mean photon number has to be restricted to the condition given in eq . .",
    "our protocol has a finite error probability due to the imperfect projection onto the time dependent contributions of the field states in the cavities that overlap with @xmath60 and @xmath80 .",
    "nevertheless , the four successful events of our protocol summarized in table [ table ] unambiguously project onto four different bell states with almost unit fidelity .",
    "in view of current experimental realizations of quantum information protocols in the field of cavity quantum electrodynamics the scheme discussed in this work requires cutting edge technology .",
    "an experimental implementation would require accurate control of the interaction time and of the average number of photons in the cavity .",
    "furthermore , the coherent evolution of the joint system must be preserved .",
    "this imposes the condition that the characteristic time of photon damping in the cavity and of atomic decay have to be much larger than the interaction time that scales with the square root of the mean photon number in the cavity . finally , we point out that the implementation of a von neumann coherent state projection is , up to our knowledge , an open problem that has to be considered in future investigations .",
    "if these obstacles are overcome , our proposal offers a key component for quantum information technology such as a multiphoton based hybrid quantum repeater .",
