    "contact mechanics between rough surfaces plays a crucial role in a large number of engineering applications , ranging from seals @xcite , boundary and mixed lubrication @xcite , adhesive systems and friction @xcite .",
    "recently , an increasing interest in these topics has been motivated by the increasing efforts made to face up new technological challenges , such as the manufacturing of novel bio - inspired adhesives @xcite , the optimization of seals  @xcite , the extreme downsizing of mechanical and electrical devices .",
    "in particular , micro- and nano - mechanical systems ( mems / nems ) have driven the development of new materials and surfaces , involving an increasing influence of surface phenomena . in such applications , where usually surfaces may experience rapid intermittent contacts",
    ", it is then very important to know how adhesion and roughness affect the behavior of the system and in particular the energy dissipation at the interface .",
    "this aspect of the problem is also very critical when scanning probe microscopy , as atomic force microscopy ( afm ) , is utilized to characterize the mechanical behavior and surface properties of materials . during adhesive contacts of rough solids the measured contact force versus displacement shows a clear hysteretic loop associated with energy dissipation @xcite , which is not observed in perfectly smooth elastic contacts .",
    "the relevance of the problem have strongly stimulated this research field .",
    "however , notwithstanding the quite large amount of papers dealing with the adhesive contact of rough surfaces @xcite , only a few papers attempt to explain the origin of adhesion hysteresis and energy dissipation in rough contacts @xcite .",
    "this is usually attributed to the presence of plasticity @xcite , interdigitations among polymer chains @xcite , humidity @xcite , viscoelasticity @xcite .",
    "in fact all these phenomena can act contemporaneously , so that distinguishing among the different causes has become of utmost importance .",
    "only a few works have made an effort in such direction .",
    "for example refs .",
    "@xcite proved that adhesion hysteresis can be observed even in the case of elastic solids provided that the contact occurs between rough surfaces.the study presented herewith aims to provide an additional contribution along this direction . by employing a methodology based on a pure continuum mechanics approach , which belongs to the class of boundary element methods ( bems ) @xcite ,",
    "we analyse numerically the loading - unloading adhesive contact of rough solids by including adhesion in terms of surface energy , i.e. by assuming that the range of the adhesive interaction is infinitely short .",
    "we study , in particular , the influence of adhesion and surface roughness on the hysteresis loop , and show that energy can be lost simply as a consequence of roughness and van der waals forces .",
    "such energy loss is numerically quantified and explained in terms of two different but concurrent mechanisms occurring at the contact interface and involving different ranges of roughness length scales .",
    "we briefly summarize the numerical methodology presented in @xcite . we consider a periodic problem where an elastic half - space is in contact with a randomly rough rigid profile of height distribution @xmath0 as shown in fig . [",
    "01 ] , where @xmath1 is the spatial period of the profile . the quantity @xmath0 is the height of the profile measured from its mean plane . because of periodicity @xmath0 can be represented in exponential form",

    "figure [ 02 ] shows the total displacement @xmath8 of the substrate , the average displacement @xmath9 of the boundary of the deformed layer , and the penetration @xmath10 of the rigid substrate into the elastic layer .",
    "these three quantities are shown to satisfy the following relation@xmath11    .",

    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 are young s modulus and poisson s ratio of the elastic layer .",
    "now let us define the separation between the elastic solid and the rigid rough substrate , i.e. the distance between the mean plane of the deformed surface and the mean plane of the rough surface , as @xmath14 ( see fig.[02 ] ) .",

    "we have considered @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "we note that once @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 are fixed , changing the hurst exponent ( i.e. the fractal dimension of the surface ) also determines a modification of the average square slope @xmath61 @xmath62 of the surface . for each generated rough profile ( see sec . [ appendice ] )",
    "the numerical calculations have been carried out for different values of the separation @xmath14 . in fig .",
    "[ 03 ] we show three different shapes of the deformed profile at three different values of the separation : @xmath63 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , for ( a ) loading and ( b ) unloading conditions .",
    "the work of adhesion is @xmath51 .",
    "the rigid rough substrate profile has a fractal dimension @xmath52 . in fig . [",
    "03 ] the value @xmath50 is the minimum value of separation at which the unloading process begins to take place after loading .",
    "therefore at @xmath50 the shape of the deformed profile is the same not depending on what condition ( i.e. loading or unloading ) is being considered .",
    "however , as the unloading proceeds further and the elastic block is moved away from the contact , the shape of the deformed profile significantly changes compared to the loading case ( see @xmath64 ) , and is characterized by a significantly larger contact area and by the formation stretched contacts with pronounced adhesive necks @xcite . this type of behavior is peculiar of asperity adhesive contact @xcite .",
    "in fact , in presence of adhesion , asperities enter in contact when the local interfacial load is still zero , but during unloading asperities are first stretched , with the formation of adhesive neck , and then jump out of contact at negative local loads . during unloading unstable local pull - off events occur at random locations @xcite leading to pronounced differences between the loading and unloading precesses .",
    "such different behaviors can be indirectly observed in in fig [ 04 ] , where the psd of the rigid substrate profile ( fractal dimension @xmath52 , non dimensional  penetration @xmath65 ) has been compared to the psd  of the deformed shape of the elastic body during loading and unloading conditions , for @xmath51 [ fig .",
    "[ 04 ] ( b ) ] and @xmath66  [ fig .",
    "[ 04 ] ( b ) ] .",
    ", compared to the psd  of the deformed shape of the elastic body at fixed non dimensional penetration @xmath65 , obtained for ( a ) @xmath51 and ( b ) @xmath67 , for loading ( blue curves ) and unloading ( red curves ) conditions.,width=302 ]    at first we remark that for large wavevectors @xmath68 , the psds of the deformed profile , either in loading or unloading conditions  ( blue and red curves respectively ) , run parallel to the psd of the rigid rough profile .",
    "this is due to the fact that , for @xmath69 , full contact always occurs between the elastic block and the short wavelength corrugation of the rough rigid profile , ( see fig .",
    "in fact , we can easily estimate the threshold wavelength @xmath70 below which full contact occurs between solid and the rigid rough substrate . to this end",
    "consider that for fractal surface the amplitude @xmath71 of each single wavy corrugation scales as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is of order of the rms roughness @xmath58 of the substrate .",
    "now assume that the elastic slab makes contact with the surface on a region of size @xmath74 in this case , assuming @xmath75 , the change of elastic energy stored in the body can be shown to be @xmath76 whereas the change of adhesion energy upon contact is @xmath77 .",
    "therefore full contact will occur when the change of total energy @xmath78 upon contact is @xmath79 . in this case",
    "the contact will occur on a single connected region , otherwise it will be split in many different contact spots .",
    "the condition @xmath79 gives @xmath80 , i.e. @xmath81 where @xmath82 is called the adhesion length .",
    "using @xmath72 one gets @xmath83 ^{1/h}=l_{th}$ ] . in our case",
    "we get @xmath84 depending on the value of the energy of adhesion . therefore , during loading , at scales below this threshold value @xmath70 we will observe the formation of small contact where the elastic solid conforms to the rigid substrate , thus leading to the observed trend of psd  ( see fig .",
    "[ 04 ] ) , which , indeed , runs parallel to the psd  of the rigid rough profile . at smaller spatial frequencies the contact is , instead ,",
    "split in many different disconnected regions .",
    "therefore partial contact occurs at the large scales and the slope of the psd of the deformed profiles must necessarily differ from the one of the rigid rough profile . in @xcite",
    "the authors have shown that , under load conditions , in such smaller range of spatial frequencies and during loading conditions , the psd  of the deformed profile closely follows a power law of the type @xmath85 in very good agreement with persson s theory @xcite . however , during unloading the psd of the deformed profile shows a different trend : ( i ) for large wave - vectors the unloading psd still runs parallel to the psd of rough profile but over a wider range of wave - vectors , ( ii ) at smaller spatial frequencies the slope of the psd , instead , does not follow persson s predictions , as shown by the larger slope of the psd curve compared to the loading case .",
    "this fact seems to suggest that the power law trend predicted by persson s theory @xcite holds true only for loading conditions .",
    "this is more evident at larger values of adhesion energy , see curve for @xmath67 in fig [ 04 ] ( b ) .",
    "when the psds of the deformed profile are compared at different values of the penetration ( see fig .",
    "[ 05 ] ) , an interesting different behavior between loading and unloading can be observed . in particular , we note that , during loading , the psd  of the deformed surface is very sensitive to the penetration value @xmath86 [ fig.[05 ] ( a ) ] , whilst this sensitivity is much less pronounced during unloading [ fig.[05 ] ( b ) ] , at least for relatively large values of the energy of adhesion @xmath67 .    ,",
    "compared to the psd  of the deformed shape of the elastic body , obtained for @xmath67 , ( a ) for loading and ( b ) unloading conditions , for different values of the non dimensional penetration @xmath87.,width=302 ]    in fig .",
    "[ 06 ] the normalized real contact area @xmath88 is shown , for different values of average square slope of the profile @xmath89 and adhesion energy @xmath39 , as a function of the dimensionless quantity @xmath90 , where @xmath91 .",
    "we have chosen to plot @xmath88 vs. @xmath90 as , for adhesiveless contacts , theories and numerical calculations [ 7,10,17,18,34 ] predict an almost linear relation between this two quantities , which is observed to be independent of the elastic properties of the material and the surface statistics .     as a function of the dimensionless quantity @xmath92 for two different hurst exponents @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) , @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) , and for three different values of energy of adhesion , @xmath51 ( black curves ) , @xmath67 ( blue curves ) , and @xmath97 ( red curves ) . as predicted by the theories",
    ", there is a marginal influence of the fractal dimension on the true contact area at small loads under loading conditions .",
    "the influence of @xmath98 becomes important during unloading .",
    "this leads to the formation of a hysteresis loading- unloading loop , which is strongly affected by the adhesion energy @xmath99,width=302 ]     ( a ) and the quantity @xmath88 ( b ) as a function of the non dimensional  penetration @xmath86 , for two different hurst exponents @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) , @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) , and for three different values of energy of adhesion , @xmath51 ( black curves ) , @xmath67 ( blue curves ) , and @xmath97 ( red curves).,width=302 ]     of the local separation @xmath100 in the non - contact area ( @xmath101 ) for @xmath102 , and @xmath67 , @xmath103 for ( a ) loading and ( b ) unloading conditions.,width=302 ]    however , in our case , this linearity is not observed , especially when the two surfaces are moved apart ( unloading ) . more importantly , given the same applied load , the contact area during unloading is much larger than during loading , thus leading to strong hysteresis .",
    "this is even more clear in figure [ 07 ] ( a ) where the dimensionless load @xmath104 is plotted vs. the non dimensional penetration @xmath86 .",
    "interestingly , being the solid perfectly elastic , such a hysteretic energy dissipation must be related to contact phenomena occurring at the interface .",
    "in fact we can propose two different mechanisms leading to energy dissipation : ( i ) the first occurring at small scales , i.e. for wavelength @xmath105 , which we refer to as the small - scale - hysteresis ( ssh ) ; ( ii ) the second at large scales , i.e. for @xmath106 , which we refer to as the large - scale - hysteresis ( lsh ) .",
    "to understand the origin of the ssh , let us recall that at small scales the solid conforms to the rigid substrate .",
    "thus , each single contact is actually represented by a compact interval .",
    "in such a case guduru and his collaborators have shown that , already a moderate roughness strongly modifies the original jkr curve providing it with a non - monotonic behavior @xcite .",
    "this , in turn , causes the unloading process to be characterized by many crack propagation jumps , with the interface separating in alternating stable and unstable segments .",
    "each unstable segments dissipates energy leading to an increase of the total work during unloading and , hence , to energy dissipation .",
    "this unstable behavior has been used in ref .",
    "@xcite to justify the hysteresis observed in jkr experiments with afm tips .",
    "the origin os lsh is instead different .",
    "in fact , as noted so far , when the surface is observed at large scales the contact is constituted by a set of disconnected small contact regions , where the short wavelength corrugation is apparently smoothed out . the contact interface , then , appears as the contact between as certain number of randomly located smooth asperities , each of one obeying the jkr adhesion laws . in such conditions israelachivili and his group @xcite proposed a very simple picture to explain the occurrence of hysteresis .",
    "as noted so far , this is indeed due to the local stretching and consequent jkr  pull - off of asperities during unloading @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy to observe that increasing the energy of adhesion @xmath39 leads to a strong increase of hysteresis loop [ see fig .",
    "[ 07 ] ( a ) ] .",
    "the origin of this behavior is twofold as increasing @xmath39 necessarily leads to : ( i ) an increase of number of contact patches , and ( ii ) to an increase of the size of each single contact patch .",
    "this , in turn , determines an enhancement of ssh and lsh phenomena , i.e. to a large increment of energy dissipation during the loading - unloading loop .",
    "figure [ 07 ] ( b ) shows the reduced real contact area @xmath88 as a function of the dimensionless penetration @xmath86 for two different hurst exponents @xmath93 ( @xmath94 ) , @xmath95 ( @xmath107 ) , and for three different values of energy of adhesion , @xmath51 ( black curves ) , @xmath67 ( blue curves ) , and @xmath108 ( red curves ) .",

    "an estimation of the dimensionless energy loss during the entire loading - unloading cycle , for different values of the average square slope of the profile , is given in table 1 .",
    "in particular no general trend can be inferred .",
    "results , instead , may suggest a non monotonic dependence of the dissipated energy on @xmath114 .",
    "this is , infact , what we expect .",
    "simple dimensional argument show indeed that the density @xmath115 of the substrate asperities increases as @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the average square curvature of the rough profile .",
    "thus , considering that @xmath118 increases with @xmath114 faster than @xmath114 , it follows that the number of asperities per unit length grows as @xmath114 is increased .",
    "therefore , for moderate values of the average square slope , increasing @xmath114 should lead , by following the mechanism proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite to an enhancement of the ssh hysteresis in each contact spot , and to and increment of the number of contact spots , thus increasing the number of lsh pull - off events .",
    "hence , for small @xmath114 , increasing @xmath114 should necessarily causes an increase of hysteresis .",
    "however , for sufficiently large values of @xmath114 , the number of contact spots as well as the contact area in each contact spot must strongly diminish ( given the same value of @xmath39 ) .",
    "this follows from the fact that , as shown above , full contact between the elastic solid and the rigid substrate on the length - scale @xmath74 , occurs when the amplitude @xmath119 of the spectral components satisfies the relation @xmath120 , that is to say @xmath121 , where @xmath122   ^{2}$ ] is the average square slope of @xmath68-component of the rigid rough profile .",
    "therefore , increasing @xmath114 will cause full contact conditions to be established at continuously decreasing lengthscales .",
    "this will strongly reduce the contact area in each contact spots , will reduce the force needed to detach the elastic body from the rigid substrate and in the end strongly diminish the adhesion hysteresis , in agreement with experimental observations in afm contacts in ref .",
