    "examples of orbifolds are discussed in @xcite and many others .    for an orbifold @xmath0",
    ", one can define in a natural way a cohomology theory with coefficients in any local system on @xmath0 .",
    "this cohomology is not an invariant of the underlying ( ` coarse ' ) space , but of the finer orbifold structure .",
    "if the orbifold is given as the orbit space @xmath2 of a group action as above , this cohomology is the equivariant sheaf cohomology of the group action .",
    "it agrees with the ( ordinary ) cohomology of the borel construction @xmath3 .",

    "it fits in well with the notion of fundamental group described in @xcite , by the familiar ` hurewicz formula ' @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is any abelian group ) .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to give a _ simplicial _ description of these cohomology groups , suitable for calculations .",
    "more precisely , using triangulations of singular spaces @xcite , we will associate to any orbifold @xmath0 , presented by an orbifold atlas as in @xcite , a simplicial set @xmath1 .",

    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    after reviewing some preliminary definitions , we will present our construction in section  [ simpcom ] of this paper .",
    "the proof of the theorem will be based on the fact that the simplicial set @xmath1 associated to an orbifold @xmath0 is also closely related to the representation of @xmath0 by a groupoid @xmath9 suggested in @xcite .",
    "in fact , our proof shows that @xmath1 has the same homotopy type as the classifying space of @xmath9 .    before giving the proof in section  [ seven ] , we will present an example of calculations based on the simplicial construction for the ` teardrop ' orbifold .",
    "we believe that much more work should be done in this direction .",
    "in fact , the explicit description of the simplicial set in terms of an atlas for the orbifold , and the resulting description of the cohomology groups by generators and relations , makes it suitable for computer assisted calculations .",
