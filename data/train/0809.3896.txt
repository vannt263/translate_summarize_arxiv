    "decimetric  metric radio emission is usually associated with plasma waves excited by accelerated electrons , where the observed emission frequency is directly related to the plasma density in the affected region @xcite .",

    "the type iii burst - associated acceleration usually happens in connection with flaring processes , by for example , reconnecting field lines .",
    "a slower drift and a broader instantaneous emission band in a radio burst can indicate a moving shock front that accelerates electrons .",
    "some of these bursts can be classified as type ii bursts , in particular when both fundamental and second harmonic emission bands are visible ( _ e.g. _ , nelson and melrose , @xcite ; mann , classen , and aurass , @xcite ; cairns _ et al .",

    "although type ii bursts indicate the existence of shock waves , their origin is not always so clear .",
    "shocks can basically be flare related or coronal mass ejection ( cme ) related , but coronal ( metric ) type ii bursts do not necessarily have the same origin as the longer wavelength ( interplanetary ) type ii bursts ( mancuso and raymond , @xcite ; cane and erickson , @xcite ; lin , mancuso , and vourlidas , @xcite , and references therein ) .",

    ". a freely propagating shock can also develop if a piston stops or slows down considerably .",
    "one characteristic of piston - driven shocks is that the speed of the propagating shock is different from the speed of the driver , and the shock speed should be higher . for bow shocks ahead of a projectile , the speeds should be roughly the same , see , for example , .",

    "metric type iii bursts that continue to decameter hectometer wavelengths ( _ wind _ waves observations ) are observed soon after the appearance of the drifting continuum .",
    "this indicates that at this early phase some field lines connected to the flaring region had opened , along which electrons could stream into the interplanetary space .",
    "about three minutes after the start of continuum emission , a metric type ii burst appears in the dynamic spectrum , at 00:16:40 ut .",
    "the burst shows emission both at the fundamental ( @xmath3120 mhz ) and second harmonic ( @xmath3240 mhz ) plasma frequencies .",
    "rstn observations show that the emission lanes are band - split .",
    "type ii burst lanes are again observed at about 00:24 ut , now with emission at 50 mhz and just above 100 mhz .",
    "the emission bands of these bursts are outlined with dashed lines in figure [ fig : fig4 ] . in between these two burst lanes , we see a pair of bursts that look like disturbed type iii emission . the lower emission patch is located around 40 mhz at 00:21 ut .",
    "there have been reports on disturbed type iii burst lanes , possibly formed when outward - streaming electrons travel through a turbulent shock region @xcite .",
    "so in our case the bursts probably trace the path of a propagating shock , when the shock no longer produces a continuous type ii burst lane .",
    "the frequency drift of the first visible type ii burst is approximately .",
    "the drift rate of the second type ii burst is about 0.1 mhz s@xmath1 .",
    "both values are within the usual 0.11.0 mhz s@xmath1 drift rate for typical type ii bursts @xcite .",
    "no interplanetary type ii bursts were observed associated with this event and no continuations of the metric type ii bursts are visible in the dynamic spectra below 14 mhz ( _ wind _ waves observations ) .",
    "as plasma emission at the fundamental emission frequency @xmath4 is directly related to electron density @xmath5 , we can use radio observations to estimate shock heights and speeds under the assumption of a coronal density model .",
    "one should be aware that height estimates depend strongly on the density models used . by calculating heights with more than one model and by taking into account the local coronal conditions",
    ", it is possible to give reliable height ranges for the emission sources . different models and their characteristics are explained in detail in , for example , , appendix a of , and .",
    "direct observations of the densities of the pre - shocked coronal plasma are still rare , ( _ e.g. _ , mancuso , @xcite ) .",
    "first , we calculate burst heights with three different atmospheric density models , which describe different types of atmospheres .",
    "the basic ( 1@xmath6 ) saito ( @xcite ) model is often used for equatorial regions in the corona , and also at large distances from the sun , where active region densities no longer dominate . a two - times newkirk",
    "( @xcite ) density model is often used for densities in streamer regions and in active region solar corona .",
    "a ten - times saito model can be used when a shock is propagating through high - density loops in the low corona .",
    "since the lasco images show a streamer region in the northwestern part of the sun where the cme appears ( figure [ fig : fig3 ] ) , high - density models should be more applicable .",
    "the estimated source heights at the start of the two bursts , and the derived velocities along the burst lanes , are given in .",
    ".estimated heliocentric source heights and radio burst velocities [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      +    we note that the radio source height given by the basic saito model at 00:16:40 ut , is very near the projected euv ejecta height at 00:16:50 ut ( 0.095 @xmath2 from the center of eruption ) .",
    "however , radio imaging observations at 164 mhz and frequencies above it usually show type ii features near heights of 0.30.4 @xmath2 above the limb @xcite .",
    "there are on - the - disk observations @xcite of smaller projected distances from the flaring region , @xmath30.2 @xmath2 , but compared to these the height of @xmath30.1 @xmath2 given by the basic saito model for a source emitting at 120 mhz is uncommonly low .",
    "the heights given by the ten - times saito model are also unrealistic at these frequencies , since the source heights are in conflict with the densities observed above active regions ( see , _ e.g. _ figure 2 in ) .",
    "the values in table [ table1 ] suggest that the two type ii bursts were propagating at different speeds .",
    "however , a change in the coronal conditions in between the bursts may change the speeds as well .",
    "for example , if the burst source first propagated in a low - density ( saito ) atmosphere in the low corona and then entered a high - density streamer ( 2@xmath6newkirk ) region , the shock speed would basically remain the same ( @xmath31000 km s@xmath1 ) , see the values in table [ table1 ] .",
    "transitions between different regions are possible since the shock can be spatially large , but in this case a low - density ( basic ) saito model atmosphere very low above the active region is not probable .",
    "type ii burst velocities can also be estimated with the scale height method , see , _ e.g. _ , .",
    "shock velocity @xmath7 can be calculated from the observed plasma frequency @xmath4 ( mhz ) , the measured frequency drift @xmath8 ( mhz s@xmath1 ) , and the scale height @xmath9 ( km ) as @xmath10 discovered that the hydrostatic isothermal scale height in a coronal temperature describes well the measured density profiles in the solar atmosphere , regardless of the base density . since the source heights presented in table [ table1 ] and the discussion on the values suggest that heights near 0.20.4 @xmath2 above the photosphere are possible for a radio source emitting at 120 mhz , we calculate the speeds using the scale height method . at a heliocentric height 1.2",
    "@xmath2 the scale height is then 109000 km .",
    "the emission frequency at the start of the first type ii burst was 120 mhz and the observed frequency drift was 0.4 mhz s@xmath1 , which gives a speed of 725 km s@xmath1 .",
    "if we assume that the radio source was located higher , at 1.4 @xmath2 , the scale height is 148000 km and the corresponding speed is 985 km s@xmath1 .",
    "if the shock propagated at 725 km s@xmath1 from a height 1.2 @xmath2 , it would have reached the height of 1.66 @xmath2 at the time when the second type ii burst started .",
    "but , the burst velocity calculated from the emission frequency of 50 mhz and the frequency drift of 0.1 mhz s@xmath1 at that height does not match with the first type ii burst ( being in fact higher ) .",
    "if , however , the second type ii burst originated from a lower height , at 1.55 @xmath2 , the calculated shock speeds for the first and second type ii bursts would be the same .",
    "this implies that a deceleration of the shock would not be able to produce the observed frequency drift of the second type ii burst , but a driver propagating at a constant speed and producing shocks at different parts ( heights ) of the expanding body could explain the two separate type ii bursts .",

    "the shaded areas for the type iis represent height values that can be obtained with less - dense atmospheric density models .",
    "the lower limits are when using the basic saito density model ( see text for details ) .",
    "red lines give the height  time trajectories for a disturbance traveling at a speed of 725 km s@xmath1 and appearing at a height of 1.2 @xmath2 at 00:16:40 ut and at a height of 1.55 @xmath2 at 00:24 ut ( calculated from the frequency drifts and scale heights ) .",

    "height ranges are shown from the basic saito and two - times newkirk atmospheric models .",
    "figure [ fig : fig5 ] also shows the height  time trajectory for a disturbance traveling at 725 km s@xmath1 , passing the height of 1.2 @xmath2 at the time of the first type ii burst appearance . a disturbance propagating at the same speed would have to be located at a lower height at the time of the second type ii burst .",
    "the projected distances for the euv loop front , euv ejecta , moreton wave , apparent front of the ejected h@xmath0 filament , eit wave , and the backward - extrapolated cme front are also given . in the plot ,",
    "the time periods of radio pulsations , start time of the drifting continuum emission , and the goes soft x - ray flux are shown for reference .    to analyze the drifting continuum emission we can not calculate height estimates , since the frequency drifts",
    "can indicate both expanding volume ( decreasing density within the volume ) and/or rising structures ( decreasing atmospheric density ) .",
    "we compared the hiras dynamic spectrum with the six norp single - frequency observations at 1 , 2 , 3.75 , 9.4 , 17 , and 35 ghz .",
    "we interpolated the radio intensity over 1100 ghz using a least squares fit for the six frequencies .",
    "the interpolated data suggest a possible expansion front  defined here as the leading front or border of a fast - expanding structure  and visible as the leading edge of the continuum emission ( figure [ fig : fig6 ] ) . this leading edge is marked with stars in the plot .",
    "electrons may have been trapped in , for example , an expanding solar magnetic arch and emitted gyrosynchrotron radiation .",
    "the continuum could then reveal radiation from nonthermal electrons confined within the plasma volume , which drives a shock .",
    "an expansion front would be located at the outer boundary of the expanding volume , and the shock would be located ahead of it .",
    "the distance between the driver and the shock is discussed more in section 4 .",
    "the continuum appeared at about the time of the filament eruption , at 00:13 ut , which is almost two minutes before eruption or shock signatures at other wavelengths were observed .",
    "the computed kinematics presented by for the moreton and eit waves , also suggest that the waves were formed later , around 00:15 ut .",
    "we can summarize the multi - wavelength analysis of the 13 july 2004 event with the following results :    \\1 .",
    "the event started with a filament eruption , followed closely by the appearance of a frequency - drifting radio continuum .",
    "the constructed microwave  meterwave dynamic spectrum ( figure [ fig : fig6 ] ) suggests that an expansion front was formed at the time of the filament eruption , almost two minutes prior to any signatures of shock wave formation at other wavelengths .",
    "this expanding plasma volume could have been driving a shock wave .",
    "the first type ii burst was observed in the dynamic spectrum soon after the euv ejecta lifted off ( from below the euv loop system ) and the moreton wave appeared .",
    "the estimated type ii burst velocity is similar to the moreton wave velocity ( @xmath3700 km s@xmath1 ) , if the type ii burst source height is set untypically low , above the photosphere .",
    "the type ii burst heights then match with the projected distances of the moreton wave front .",
    "we do not expect the moreton wave and type ii burst speeds to be exactly the same . according to uchida s model @xcite , the h@xmath0 moreton wave is created when the `` skirt '' of a shock wave sweeps the chromosphere .",
    "the shock velocity upward probably differs from the horizontal velocity , but the observed velocities can still be used as rough estimates for the shock speed ( like the type ii speeds ) .",
    "the backward - extrapolation of a shock propagating with a constant speed of 725 km s@xmath1 suggests a common start time with the frequency - drifting radio continuum ( figure [ fig : fig5 ] ) . for comparison , at more typical type ii heights , @xmath30.3 ,",
    "the calculated burst velocities get much higher , @xmath31000 , and no correlation with the heights of other features can be found .",
    "the second type ii burst had a frequency drift that suggests a speed different from that of the first type ii burst , thus implying a different driver for the shock .",
    "calculations show that the type ii bursts could have been formed by one shock only , if the shock propagated at a constant speed and the later shocked region was located lower in the shock driver structure ( _ e.g. _ , if the first type ii burst was created at the nose of expanding loops and the second one on the sides ) .",
    "the estimated height separation , , is not large enough to indicate a separation between , for example , a shock in front of a cme and at the flanks .",
    "a decelerating shock would not have been able to produce the observed frequency drift of the second type ii burst .",
    "a single shock propagating through regions with very different densities , such as first through low density structures and later through high - density streamer regions , would also produce similar jumps in the type ii source heights . despite these different interpretations ,",
    "the estimated heights for the second type ii burst are close to the observed eit wave distance and the backward - extrapolated cme front distances , although the speeds differ considerably .    freely propagating shock waves",
    "can be formed in flare blasts or when a piston is stopped or it slows down ( _ e.g. _ , ) .",
    "the speed of the propagating shock and the speed of the initial driver can then differ considerably .",
    "also the shock should be spatially well separated from the driver .",

    "et al . _ , @xcite ) .",
    "have shown in their simulations how the speed of the shock ( and hence the corresponding type ii burst speed ) can far exceed the speed of the driver , and the shock can continue propagation through the corona even if the driver speed falls below the local magnetosonic speed .",
    "recent radio imaging observations @xcite show a type ii burst located ahead of a rising soft x - ray loop .",
    "the speed of the rising loop was only 650 km s@xmath1 at the start time of the type ii burst .",
    "as stated in their paper , and in another paper analyzing the same event @xcite , the derived speeds for the type ii shocks ( obtained with different methods , but in the range of 11001800 km s@xmath1 ) are much higher than those of their assumed drivers .    based on the theory and our calculations for burst heights and speeds , and the observation of the moreton wave , it is possible that the first type ii burst was formed by a blast wave .",
    "the earlier start of the frequency - drifting radio continuum suggests that a shock wave may also have been ignited by a fast - expanding structure .",
    "loop - like fronts , such as the rising euv loop in this case , can be the low - coronal signatures of cmes @xcite , that drive the shock . presented a case where a shock is driven by rising loops and a type ii burst is due to a flare blast that starts later . in this scenario",
    "the type ii burst source is located within the ejecta material .",
    "type ii emission can also be produced when a flare shock overtakes regions of principal density pile - up near the base and sides of an expanding transient @xcite .",
    "this could also explain our low radio source heights .",
    "have analyzed statistically several doublet type ii bursts , and concluded that usually the second type ii burst starts at a lower frequency than the first one and the drift rate is only about half of the first one . in our event",
    "the frequency drift of the second type ii burst is slower by a factor of 4 .",
    "the rare imaging observations of multiple type ii bursts @xcite suggest that a single shock may exist , but as the shock propagates at different locations the type ii bursts may have different characteristics . to verify this ,",
    "imaging observations are needed at radio and other wavelengths , to determine source locations and corresponding electron densities .",
    "we have presented analysis of a very complex flare - cme event , with a multitude of radio features and transients at other wavelengths , and obtained evidence for both blast wave shock and cme - related emissions during the initial phase . however",
    ", definite conclusions will rely on future radio imaging .",
    "it is unfortunate that radio imaging currently exists only at very narrow frequency ranges , leaving out plasma emission above 500 mhz and below 150 mhz . for the identification of the source locations in decimetric ",

    "<S> this interpretation also requires that the shock - producing regions were located at different parts of the propagating structure , or that the shock was passing through regions with highly different atmospheric densities . </S>",
    "<S> this complex event , with a multitude of radio features and transients at other wavelengths , presents evidence for both blast - wave - related and cme - related radio emissions . </S>"
