    "[ ]    figure  [ fig1]a shows a transmission electron microscopy image of our peapod material , containing swnts densely filled with c@xmath0 molecules . for electrical transport measurements , individual peapods with a diameter of 1.3 - 2  nm were contacted by pd / au source and drain electrodes , as schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "( see methods for more details on devices . )",
    "the c@xmath0 peapods showed clear coulomb blockade behavior at low temperatures ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]c ) , indicating that single - electron charging effects dominated the low - temperature electrical transport .",
    "both the charging energy @xmath3  mev and the electronic level spacing @xmath4  mev corresponded well to a 400  nm wide separation between the contact electrodes . since the dots were probed at gate voltage ranges corresponding to a reduced electronic coupling @xmath1 to the leads , no zero - bias kondo anomaly @xcite was observed here .",
    "figure  [ fig2]a depicts the linear conductance @xmath5 of a fullerene peapod as a function of gate voltage @xmath6 , revealing coulomb blockade oscillations .",
    "this kind of experiment is a basic tool for probing both the energy spectrum and the wavefunctions of the elementary excitations in a quantum dot : the positions of the cb peaks provide information about the spectrum , while the magnitude of the tunneling current is proportional to the overlap between the wave functions of the incident electron and the elementary excitation in the dot .",
    "the temperature dependence of the heights of the five cb peaks that appear in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]b .",
    "[ ]     the lineshape and temperature response of coulomb blockade oscillations in the linear conductance has been widely investigated in the past @xcite , both for metallic and semiconductor quantum dots . in the cb regime where electron transport occurs only via a single electronic dot level , the tunneling probability as a function of energy is given by the breit - wigner formula ( see caption to fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of the conductance peaks is therefore entirely due to thermal broadening of the energy of the incident electrons : the peak height is independent of temperature in the low - temperature limit , where @xmath7 , while in the opposite high - temperature limit , @xmath8 , a universal @xmath9-behavior appears .",
    "this corresponds to what we observed for empty swnts , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig2]c - e .    for fullerene peapods , however , the measured temperature dependence of the conductance peaks is often significantly different ( see fig .",
    "2b ) , implying that the breit - wigner picture is no longer valid .",
    "we interpret this discrepancy as a signature of a change in the spectrum of the elementary excitations and of their wavefunctions , a change that can be associated with the encapsulated fullerenes . typically , as highlighted in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a , an anomalous temperature dependence appears on the scale of a few kelvin .",
    "the corresponding energy is of the order of @xmath10 mev , which is small on the electronic energy scale but relevant for the longitudinal vibrational motion of the encapsulated fullerenes .",
    "( for the low - diameter peapods used in our study , the characteristic scale of transverse vibrations would be @xmath111 mev . )    in order to interpret our experimental results , we use a model where swnt electrons are electromechanically coupled to a set of low - frequency vibrators : single c@xmath0 fullerenes @xcite or their clusters trapped by a longitudinal harmonic potential inside the nanotube . within this approach ,",
    "the peapod is treated as a multilevel quantum dot for which each quantized electronic level is selectively coupled to a single vibrational mode , in a similar manner as in the local holstein model @xcite , and the corresponding dimensionless electron - vibron coupling constant @xmath12 is proportional to the amplitude of the vibronic quantum fluctuations . as a result",
    ", the resonant tunneling electrons can be dressed by vibrational excitations if they spend sufficiently long time in the dot to form real electron - vibron hybrids ",
    "holstein polarons @xcite .",
    "since the probability of polaron formation is enhanced for long electron dwell times in the quantum dot , @xmath13 , polaronic effects become more pronounced in the regime of weak electronic coupling @xmath1 .",
    "we stress that the electron - vibron coupling does not have any significant effect on the fullerene vibrations themselves , as they are mostly determined by the c@xmath0 confinement within the carbon nanotube . even though the coupling to each single electronic level may be strong and depend on the position of the oscillating fullerenes , their total energy shift averages out over a large number of individual electronic states in the dot .    [ ]     our model calculations ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]b ) have revealed qualitatively similar features to those experimentally observed for conductance peaks deviating from conventional breit - wigner behavior ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) .",
    "in particular , three characteristic thermal regimes can be distinguished : ( i ) when the thermal energy is much smaller than the vibration energy , @xmath14 , the conductance becomes suppressed for strong electron - vibron coupling @xmath15 .",
    "such a _ polaronic _ ( or franck - condon ) blockade of conductance @xcite signals the reduced probability for an electron to tunnel from a pure electronic state in the lead to a polaronic state in the dot , and vice versa .",
    "( ii ) as the temperature rises , the population of the thermally excited vibronic levels increases which has a destructive effect on the polaronic wavefunction .",
    "this leads to a non - monotonic behavior of the conductance in the temperature interval @xmath16 , where @xmath17 represents the characteristic energy of a polaron .",
    "( iii ) at high temperatures , @xmath18 , polaronic effects are lifted and the conductance takes standard breit - wigner form @xmath19 .    to determine the electron - vibron coupling @xmath12 in the peapod devices ,",
    "we have numerically fitted the temperature dependence of conductance maxima ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]a ) with the thermal progression predicted by our model ( eq .  [ gt2 ] in methods ) .",
    "the obtained fits are in good agreement with the experimental data , yielding large values for the polaronic coupling parameter , @xmath20 .",
    "these values are consistent with the suppression of the conductance observed at low temperatures .",
    "they are also of the same order of magnitude as in previous experiments on suspended carbon nanotube devices @xcite where the vibronic states were due to intrinsic modes of the swnt .",
    "( note that in refs .   and",
    "the coupling constant was defined as @xmath21 ) .",
    "the inset to fig .",
    "[ fig3]a gathers all the fitting parameters extracted for the investigated peaks .",
    "the vibrational origin of the abnormal features observed in the @xmath22 is in addition supported by the appearance of weak , quasi - periodic excitation lines along the edges of the coulomb blockade diamonds in the stability diagrams , as indicated by arrows in fig .",
    "the mean energy spacing @xmath23  mev of these nearly equidistant excitations is an order of magnitude smaller than the electronic level spacing @xmath24  mev in our 400  nm long peapod quantum dots . on the other hand",
    ", it closely matches the values of vibrational quanta extracted from the fits to @xmath25 , see the inset to fig .",
    "as mentioned before , our experimental data clearly indicate that not all of the studied conductance peaks show abnormal features in their temperature dependence , see fig .",
    "this observation can be explained if , for different swnt electron states @xmath26 , there are strong fluctuations @xcite in the value of the polaronic coupling constant .",
    "such fluctuations may be due to a local character of the electromechanical coupling .",
    "consequently , only for some electronic levels the characteristic time needed to form a polaronic state @xmath27 is sufficiently shorter than the electron dwell time in the dot @xmath28 .",
    "we note here that the electronic coupling @xmath1 could not be directly determined from the polaronic fits .",
    "instead , we were able to probe a related parameter @xmath29 , yielding @xmath30  mev for the investigated conductance peaks . here ,",
    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 are electronic couplings to the left and to the right reservoir of the quantum dot , respectively , and @xmath33 . assuming symmetric barriers , @xmath34 , the value of @xmath1 could thus be evaluated as @xmath35 .",
    "for the asymmetric coupling , @xmath36 , this would yield @xmath37 .    in order to gain some insight into the nature of the vibrational motion of fullerene molecules trapped inside a swnt ,",
    "we have performed a simple estimation of the potential that confines their longitudinal motion .",
    "the confining potential can readily be obtained from girifalco s universal potential for graphitic structures @xcite if we assume that it is mainly due to the interaction of a vibrating c@xmath0 molecule with its nearest - neighbor molecules ( one on each side ) .",
    "the resulting potential is well approximated by a harmonic potential characterized by the force constant @xmath38  nm@xmath39 .",
    "the corresponding vibrational energy quantum @xmath40 matches the value of about @xmath41  mev , needed to fit the experiments , for a particle mass about ten times larger than that of a single c@xmath0 molecule ( @xmath42  kg ) .",
    "the implication is that the relevant molecular vibrations may involve clusters of about ten c@xmath0s . for peapods with densely packed fullerene chains , clusters of this size could form inside the swnt , for example , as a result of local tube corrugations or presence of defects ( openings ) on swnt side wall @xcite .",
    "the present incomplete understanding of how a nanotube is affected by encapsulated fullerenes is an obstacle for peapods to reach their full potential in nanoelectronic applications @xcite .",
    "the experiments presented here shed light on this issue : they demonstrate the presence of nanoelectromechanical coupling in carbon peapods which thus emerge as a new class of nanoelectromechanical systems .",
    "moreover , the characterization technique described here can be thought of as a tool for detecting the presence of fullerenes , or other molecules , in a nanotube .",
    "such an experimental verification can be performed _ in situ _ for individual tubes in electronic devices , unlike in other detection techniques which require either a large ensemble of peapods ( raman spectroscopy @xcite , x - ray @xcite ) or probing in dedicated systems ( transmission electron microscopy , scanning tunneling microscopy @xcite , low - temperature atomic force microscopy @xcite ) .",
    "further studies using suspended peapods could allow a tuning of the fullerenes spatial distribution within the nanotube by means of mechanical bending deformations of the swnt .",
    "if the resonant character of electron transmission could be controlled mechanically by these means or others , carbon peapods could find applications as nems resonators with an operation frequency set by the vibrational motion of the encapsulated fullerenes in the 100 ghz range .",
    "the high - quality fullerene peapods investigated in our study were based on arc discharge - grown swnts . the empty tubes ( also used as the reference swnts )",
    "were supplied by nanocarblab as a purified material ( 80% pure grade ) . due to the purification procedure ( multi - step heating in air , soaking in hno@xmath43 , microfiltration ) , the as - received swnts were already opened and required no further treatment prior to their filling with c@xmath0 fullerenes ( 98% purity , interchim ) . the filling was carried out via the vapor phase method @xcite , in an evacuated and sealed ampoule at @xmath44c for 24 hours . in order to remove excess fullerenes ,",
    "heat treatment was afterwards performed under dynamic vacuum , at @xmath45c for 1 hour .",
    "transmission electron microscopy indicated that 90 - 95% of the tubes in the resulting material encapsulated fullerenes ( i.e. , were peapods ) .",
    "a quantitative analysis by x - ray diffraction @xcite confirmed that the peapods were densely packed with c@xmath0s , with a filling ratio of @xmath46% .",
    "in addition , signatures of the encapsulated c@xmath0 fullerenes were found in raman spectroscopy .",
    "the peapods ( or the reference empty nanotubes ) were sonicated in dichloroethane and deposited on a silicone wafer covered with silicone oxide .",
    "individual tubes with a diameter of @xmath47 nm were located and selected for further processing by means of atomic force microscopy .",
    "electron beam lithography was then used to define source and drain electrodes of pd / au ( 15nm/45 nm ) , with a spacing of 400 nm . a highly n - doped si substrate ,",
    "situated beneath the 500nm - thick sio@xmath48 layer , served as a backgate .",
    "electrical transport experiments were performed in a @xmath49he cryostat with a base temperature of @xmath50  mk .",
    "we highlight here the main steps of our theoretical modeling , which is based on the local holstein model@xcite .",
    "more details can be found in ref .",
    "in order to get analytical results , we assume that only one vibrating scatterer ( a cluster of fullerenes or a single molecule ) is confined inside the swnt .",
    "the full hamiltonian for a two - terminal peapod qd system reads : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the hamiltonian for the fermi leads and @xmath53 for the left and right reservoir , respectively .",
    "the peapod - qd hamiltonian reads : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the set of energy levels in the dot , @xmath40 is the vibrational quantum of energy , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 is the amplitude of the zero - point fluctuations of the bosonic field . @xmath58 and @xmath59 are fermionic and bosonic operators with canonical commutation relations .",
    "the longitudinal motion of the scatterer in the swnt is defined by a harmonic potential .",
    "finally , the tunneling hamiltonian reads : @xmath60 where we suppose that the hopping matrix elements @xmath61 between the two leads and the dot are of the same order .",
    "the above qd hamiltonian can be diagonalized by a unitary transformation , which reveals that the major effect of the vibrational bosonic field is to renormalize the energy levels in the dot .",
    "these levels are shifted by an amount @xmath62 , the so called polaronic shift , where @xmath63 is the electron - vibron coupling constant . to obtain the expression for the conductance of our system ,",
    "we start from the meir - wingreen formula @xcite    @xmath64\\im \\mathrm m\\{\\mathrm{tr}[\\gamma\\ , g_\\mathrm{qd}^\\mathrm{ret}(\\varepsilon)]\\},\\label{curr}\\ ] ]    where @xmath65 are the fermi functions for the left and right reservoirs , @xmath66 ; @xmath67 are the widths of the resonance due to tunneling from the left or right lead , and @xmath68 are the densities of states in the reservoirs .",
    "@xmath69 is the retarded green function of the dot which can be evaluated in the wide - band limit@xcite .    by means of the gate voltage , an energy level in the qd",
    "can be tuned to line up with the fermi level @xmath70 in the leads , so that @xmath71 .",
    "this is when the conductance reaches its maximum . in the linear conductance regime",
