    "while the equivalence principle ( ep ) is a well defined principle in classical physics ( see e.g. will @xcite ) it is not clear whether there is an analogous principle in the quantum domain .",
    "the main problem seems to be that for the formulation of eps in the classical domain one has to use local notions like path ( the path of a structureless point particle does not depend on the mass of the particle ) or point ( gravity can be transformed away in one point ) while quantum physics is genuinely non - local ( fields in general are spread over all space , expectation values are integrals over a whole @xmath0 hypersurface , etc . ) .    beside this general issue",
    "there are many arguments which indicate that there is no ep in quantum theory :    1 .",
    "because the phase shift of a neutron interference experiment in a gravitational field @xmath1 depends on the mass @xcite , the weak ep is regarded as not being valid for quantum phenomena @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the cow experiment @xcite together with the experiment of bonse and wroblewski @xcite may be used to verify the strong ep in the sense that gravitational acceleration is equivalent to the acceleration of a reference system ( for an extensive discussion see @xcite ) .",
    "however , this statement is exactly true only for vanishing curvature , i.e.  for uniform acceleration or homogeneous gravitational fields .",
    "the influence of a non - linear newtonian potential ( or of curved space - time ) on the interference pattern can not be transformed away using accelerated frames , ( see below ) .",
    "3 .   the wave function solving the schrdinger equation in a homogeneous gravitational field or in an accelerated frame",
    "depends on the mass @xcite .",
    "this feature is to be expected because the equation of motion , contrary to the equation of motion for point particles , depends on the mass .",
    "this is true in the relativistic as well as in the non - relativistic domain .",
    "the ep is certainly not fulfilled for particles with internal structure like spin . using a wkb - approximation of the dirac equation in riemann - cartan space - time",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the spin couples to the space - time curvature and the torsion so that the particle s path and energy depend on the spin direction .",
    "5 .   in addition",
    ", within another context like a causal interpretation of quantum mechanics , it has also been shown that quantum theory does not obey the ep @xcite .",
    "contrary to all statements that there is no ep in the quantum domain , it has been remarked by treder @xcite that a paradoxical situation will arise if on the one hand all equations of motion ( field equations for quantum matter , e.g. klein - gordon , dirac equation ) are covariantly coupled to gravity ( minimal coupling procedure ) and on the other hand the influence of gravity on quantum matter may be mass dependent .",
    "since the schrdinger equation is the non - relativistic limit of the klein - gordon- or the dirac equation , this statement holds for this equation too .",
    "our considerations will support the point of view that the effects of gravity on quantum matter are essentially mass independent if written in an appropriate way .    of course ,",
    "characteristic quantum properties like the compton wavelength or the width of the interference fringes of matter waves which pass through a double slit do depend on the mass of the matter wave .",
    "however , this is not the problem we are dealing with .",
    "our question is whether there are _ quantum effects which are universally influenced by the interaction with gravitation_. thereby we refer to quantum effects as the interference pattern in matter wave interferometry or the path of the mean value of the position operator . by universal influence we mean an influence which is independent of characteristic properties of the quantum matter like mass .",
    "it will turn out in the following that contrary to the remark of treder effects like the phase shifts in atomic beam and neutron interferometry in general do depend on the mass of the particles , so that the ep is not fulfilled .",
    "the reason is that especially in quantum mechanics it is necessary to disturb the quantum system by some input in order to measure its properties .",
    "that means that in matter wave interferometry we have to take into account the quantum nature of the interaction of the beam splitters and mirrors with the matter field .",
    "however , it proves to be possible and useful to introduce the notion of an _ input independent result_. this notion extracts from the measured effect those parts which are characteristic for the ` pure ' interaction of the quantum matter with external fields .",
    "it gives a mass independend result in the case of a gravitational interaction .",
    "this kind of result is independent of the input of the measuring apparatus used into the quantum system .    in the following we treat spinless matter fields obeying the schrdinger equation .",
    "we will not treat relativistic effects .",
    "thereby we restrict our considerations to first quantisation .",
    "( we are not dealing with the ep in quantum field theory , see e.g. @xcite where it is shown that a homogeneous gravitational field and a uniform acceleration are equivalent if one takes correct boundary conditions . )    our proposition is that quantum mechanics fulfills a slightly modified ep which we call a quantum equivalence principle ( qep ) .",
    "it states that for each given initial state the input independent result of a physical experiment is independent of the mass or charge of the quantum system .",
    "thereby we lay stress on an _ operational realisation _ of the qep in the quantum domain . in addition , the qep is valid in arbitrarily curved space - time .",
    "the qep is a statement about experimental results and not about the structure of a field equation .",
    "the latter can be derived from the experimental results and the qep . in the case of atom beam and neutron interferometry",
    "we discuss and analyse the extent to which the ep and the qep is valid .",
    "we show that the mass dependence of quantum phenomena like the modification of the interference fringes caused by the gravitational field is due to the quantum nature of the interaction of the quantum systems with the ` quantum beam splitters ' and ` quantum mirrors ' which are given by laser waves and crystals .",
    "for quantum phenomena it is not possible to formulate a strong ep .",
    "the validity of the qep implies that the influence of gravitation on quantum matter is of geometrical nature .",
    "this implies that one can define fields which couple _ universally _ to quantum systems , that is , independently of its properties . using the qep the other way round",
    ", the validity of the qep implies that it is possible to _ reconstruct _ the strucure of the coupling of gravity to matter field equations .",
    "this means that the ep or qep acts as a selection rule for geometrical interactions which are called gravitation .",
    "this is totally analogous to the approach in the case of point particles where the ep is used to derive the coupling of gravity to structureless point particles which result in the geodesic equation in the case of relativistic mechanics or the equation of motion @xmath2 in newtonian mechanics .    in the following",
    "we will briefly discuss the formulation and implications of the eps in classical physics .",
    "then we introduce the notion of input independent results of experiments which is used to formulate a qep .",
    "thereby we lay emphasis on atom beam interferometry which was first proposed theoretically by bord @xcite for a spatial interaction geometry and subsequently realised @xcite . here",
    "we theoretically treat the atom beam interferometer used by kasevich and chu @xcite based on a temporal interaction geometry .",
    "( due to the great accuracy which may be achieved by atom beam interferometry , this device attracted great interest as a possible tool for precise experiments in the gravitational field to measure the space ",
    "time curvature @xcite or to test gravitational theories @xcite . ) in addition we also treat neutron interferometric experiments using a single crystal of the bonse - hart type . compared to neutron interferometers atom beam interferometers are more precise and more flexible in their experimental variability .",
    "our qep will be discussed mainly in the context of matter wave interferometry .",
    "we show that matter wave interferometric measurements are in accordance with our qep .",
    "in addition , we show that the path of the mean value of the position operator also fulfills our qep . this path especially does not depend on the mass of the matter field , so that the path of the mean value of the position operator of atoms , neutrons , electrons etc .",
    "coincide when subject to gravitational interaction only .",
    "in order to touch on the notions involved , we briefly discuss some features and implications of eps in classical physics .",
    "classical physics thereby means that we are dealing with structureless point particles .",
    "the eps are therefore necessarily _ local _ statements dealing with local properties of particle paths .",
    "the _ weak ep _ consists of two parts : first the universality of free fall which means that the path of the structureless point particles does not depend on their mass or composition .",
    "this is not enough to describe the path by some ordinary differential equation because the path in the future may depend on its history . because this has never been observed , the weak ep states secondly that , if the position @xmath3 and the initial velocity @xmath4 is given then the path is uniquely determined , @xmath5 . by means of this second statement",
    "it is now possible to describe the path by an ordinary differential equation of second order : @xmath6 .",
    "the trajectory is uniquely determined , and does not depend on the mass or on the composition of the structureless particle .",
    "the main conclusion is that any effect of gravity like the geodesic deviation is universal and that gravity therefore can be geometrised . in the framework of newtonian mechanics",
    "the weak ep amounts to the statement that inertial mass and gravitational mass are equal . for",
    "the present status of experimental verification of the universality of free fall see @xcite .",
    "the _ strong ep _ states that locally all ( non - gravitational ) physical laws acquire their special relativistic form .",
    "that means the effect of gravity can be locally transformed away by choosing a suitable reference frame , so that gravity is locally indistinguishable from some non - inertial motion .    for the path of point particles obeying the strong",
    "ep this means that locally there is a coordinate system and a parametrisation so that @xmath7 . for arbitrary coordinates and parameters we now have an equation of the structure @xmath8 for some function @xmath9 depending on the parametrisation of the path .",
    "the strong ep also applies pointwise for fields .",
    "mathematically it is the minimal coupling procedure ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the strong ep implies the weak ep . while the weak ep is necessary and sufficient for the geometrisation procedure of the gravitational interaction , the strong ep fixes the structure of this interaction and is therefore a stronger principle .",
    "the strong ep is also crucial for treating general relativity as gauge theory , see @xcite .",
    "both eps use local notions .",
    "the weak ep is a statement of universality : the effect of gravity is the same for all particles , it does not depend on the properties of the particles .",
    "the weak ep does not require that gravity can be transformed away locally .",
    "quantum mechanics is a non - local description of matter . for non - local phenomena the effects of gravity",
    "can not be transformed away .",
    "consequently , to formulate an ep for the quantum domain we have to avoid any reference to locality and to procedures that transform away effects .",
    "while the strong ep can not be freed from notions of locality the weak ep may be generalised by stating that the effect of gravity in a certain experimental setup is the same for a whole class of physical systems prepared with the same initial conditions . in the following the class of physical systems",
    "consists in the quantum systems fulfilling the schrdinger equation .",
    "at the beginning we introduce the following notions which are characteristic for physical experiments : a point particle or a quantum system which is subject to the experiment is called a _ physical system_. the assignement of a position and velocity at a certain moment for a point particle or a certain initial state for a quantum system is the _ preparation _ of the physical system .",
    "after preparation the physical system evolves in some _ physical situation _ , that is , in some external fields ( maxwell field , gravity ) , perhaps with boundary conditions . in order to be able to measure properties of the physical systems one has to manipulate the physical system while preparing it or during its evolution by some experimental _ input _ ( e.g. throwing light on the point particle to track its path , shooting photons with a well defined wave vector on atoms to transmit momentum etc . ) . to be more clear : by input",
    "we mean the strength of the quantity manipulating the physical system , e.g. the value of the wave vector of the photon interacting with the atom . in the case of quantum systems this input in general disturbs the evolution of the quantum system and changes its properties .",
    "the altered properties also give rise to an altered behaviour of the system in the external fields .",
    "therefore it is of importance especially for the quantum domain to be able to reformulate the experimental results in such a way that one can extract results which are not sensitive to the changes of the physical system due to the experimental input .",
    "the notion which fulfills this demand and which we are going to define below is the notion of an input independent result .",
    "this gives information about the interaction of the physical system with the external field which are ` pure ' and characteristic for the quantum system interacting with an external field or force .",
    "let @xmath10 be a physical system , @xmath11 the experimental input to this system and @xmath12 a measured effect which depends on the input acting on the physical system .",
    "for one physical system there may be many types of inputs , @xmath13 , corresponding to the properties of the physical system which is going to be measured .",
    "the following analysis holds for each type of input .",
    "we assume that , if there is no input @xmath14 , then there is no effect : @xmath15 .",
    "( if one is given a formula for an effect @xmath16 which does not fulfill this relation , i.e. @xmath17 , then one can define an effect by @xmath18 . ) for simplicity we also assume that the dependence of @xmath12 on @xmath11 is @xmath19 .",
    "this implies that there is a real number @xmath20 and another function @xmath21 with the property @xmath22 and @xmath23 so that @xmath24 .",
    "we call the limit @xmath25 the _ input independent result_. it does not depend on @xmath11 anymore .",
    "the input independent result describes the effect for vanishing input normalised by the respective input .",
    "an example for the above procedure from classical physics is the geodesic deviation equation @xmath26 by means of which the curvature tensor can be determined @xcite .",
    "@xmath27 is the measured acceleration , @xmath28 is the four velocity , and @xmath29 is the space - like distance vector between two neighbouring geodesics .",
    "@xmath30 is part of the preparation procedure and represents the ` input ' .",
    "the input independent result is the curvature which is determined by @xmath31 for all directions @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    " we will use the concept of an input independent result in the context of quantum interference which is described by a closed path in some parameter space .",
    "then this concept describes the infinitesimalisation of the closed path .    using the notions introduced above we now propose a version of an ep for the quantum domain :    * quantum equivalence principle ( qep ) : * _ for all given initial states the input independent result of a physical experiment is independent of the characteristic parameters ( like mass , charge ) of the quantum system_.    we will make a few general comments on this qep :    1 .",
    "there are two major points used in the formulation of this qep : the initial state and the input independent result .",
    "the first one is necessary to get rid of the nonlocality in quantum theory : the initial value of an expectation value is not enough to determine the time evolution of this expectation value .",
    "therefore one has to use the initial state which in general is described by a spread - out field . the second point is necessary to avoid the quantum nature of the interaction : if one weakens more and more the input acting on the spread - out quantum system , then one gets after normalisation a result which does not depend on the input .",
    "the above formulation of a qep uses no local terms .",
    "it is again a universality statement in the sense that an experimental result is the same for all physical systems .",
    "the universality makes it possible to geometrise the gravitational interaction in the quantum domain .",
    "we do not require that gravity can be transformed away .",
    "this is possible only locally and is therefore not a notion which is appropriate for spread - out fields .",
    "( of course , a homogeneous gravitational field can be transformed away so that in this case the strong ep is fulfilled . however , in this case the curvature vanishes so that we are restricted to a flat space - time . )",
    "the qep is stated without reference to gravitation .",
    "this has to be understood in an _ operational _ manner : each interaction which is universal in the above sense can be geometrised and will be called gravitation . in this way",
    "each equivalence principle ( for classical point particles as well as for quantum systems ) can single out and define the gravitational interaction .",
    "we will show in the following that the gravity induced phase shifts of atom beam and neutron interference experiments and the time evolution of expectation values and uncertainties support the above version of a qep .",
    "we start with a treatment of three - level atoms used by the raman light - pulse interferometer @xcite .",
    "the three levels are denoted by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 stands for ` intermediate state ' .",
    "we base our considerations on the hamiltonian ( @xmath36 is the momentum operator , @xmath37 the position operator , bold - face symbols are 3-vectors , indices run from 1 to 3 ; although not necessary , we distinguish between covariant and contravariant tensor indices and use einstein s summation convention ) @xmath38 @xmath39 is the energy of the @xmath9th level of the atom .",
    "@xmath40 is the usual dipole interaction ( @xmath41 is the electric dipole operator and @xmath42 the electric field ) and @xmath43 describes the interaction with the gravitational field where @xmath44 is the newtonian potential . and the gravitational mass @xmath45 appearing in the kinetic and gravitational interaction part , respectively . the fact that in ( [ schroedinger ] ) we take these two masses as equal does not anticipate that the ep in terms of _ measured _ physical effects is fulfilled .",
    "a possible violation may be due to the nonlocality of the quantum state and the quantum interaction with beam splitters .",
    "in fact , the result ( [ mzphase1 ] ) shows that the ep is not fulfilled ( the qep is ) . ] in the following we expand the newtonian potential to second order @xmath46 with the acceleration @xmath47 and the second derivative @xmath48 which can be identified with the components @xmath49 of the riemannian space - time curvature .",
    "we neglect spontaneous emission and dephasing .    in atomic beam interferometry @xcite we start with a three - level system which effectively will reduce to a two - level system .",
    "the first step consists in a decomposition of the state vector into plane waves whereby we split the free evolution : @xmath50 with @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the momentum of the plane wave .",
    "the quantum system is prepared at @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath55 is the fourier transform of @xmath56 .",
    "the electric field consists of two counterpropagating waves @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "we assume that @xmath59 only induces transitions between @xmath60 and @xmath61 , and @xmath62 and @xmath63 , and that the rotating wave approximation is valid .",
    "the interference experiment starts with the preparation of the state @xmath64 .",
    "projecting successively the above schrdinger equation on this state , on @xmath65 and on @xmath66 gives the time evolution of the respective coefficients : @xmath67 where we defined the complex rabi frequencies @xmath68 and @xmath69 and @xmath70 and where the dot means the time derivative and @xmath71 complex conjugation .",
    "eqns ( [ dyna1]-[dyna2 ] ) describe the dynamics of the set @xmath72 which is called a _ closed set of coupled states_. note that the dynamics , that is , the schrdinger equation , maps @xmath73 for all @xmath53 if and only if the interaction is of polynomial form .",
    "a non - polynomial interaction leads to a non - local propagation in momentum space .",
    "this means that if one prepares a state with initial momentum @xmath53 the above dynamics mixes only states which belong to @xmath74 ; no other states are involved .",
    "each @xmath74 is a dynamically invariant subspace of the hilbert space .",
    "consequently , we have proved that only for polynomial interactions we still have a closed set of coupled states which , in the case of atom beam interferometry , will effectively reduce to a two - level system by adiabatic elimination of the intermediate state .",
    "we solve the dynamical equations ( [ dyna1]-[dyna2 ] ) approximately by the following procedure : we assume that the time of the interaction between the laser and the atoms is small compared to the total flight time of the atoms inside the interferometer .",
    "in addition , during the laser - atom interaction the strength of the dipole interaction is much stronger than the gravitational interaction ( @xmath75 for @xmath76 ) .",
    "thus it is possible to neglect the gravitational interaction for the laser - atom interaction zones .",
    "( it is possible to treat the influence of the acceleration on the beam splitting process @xcite which leads to small corrections in the phase shift of the order @xmath77 .",
    "since we are more interested in principal questions we did not take this into account . )      for @xmath78 we can adiabatically eliminate the intermediate level ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath79 where we introduced the definitions @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the frequency of the hyperfine transition and @xmath82 .",
    "the @xmath83-term describes the doppler shift .",
    "thus we are able to replace the three level system ( [ dyna1]-[dyna2 ] ) effectively by the two level system ( [ 2level1],[2level2 ] ) .",
    "the solutions of the above equations of motion ( [ 2level1],[2level2 ] ) is well known and can be used to define @xmath84 and @xmath85 pulses @xcite which serve as mirrors , beam splitters and recombiners .",

    "@xmath93 is some additional constant phase depending on the laser .      for the dark zones where no laser interacts with the atom only gravity is present .",

    "in fact , in the atom beam interferometric set up it is not possible to operationally define paths the atoms may take .",
    "2 .   the last point is also reflected by the fact that the result ( [ mzphase1 ] ) is exact in a quantum sense : no classical approximation is used .",
    "the above result is also exact in the acceleration @xmath139 and is of first order in @xmath102 which may be interpreted as the newtonian part of the riemannian curvature .",
    "the only approximations used are the approximation of the newtonian potential to second order in the position and the approximation of the solution ( [ gravsol ] ) in @xmath102 .",
    "3 .   the phase shift does not depend on the value @xmath140 where @xmath141 may be chosen as the position expectation value @xmath142 of the atom beam in the moment of the first @xmath85-pulse .",
    "the first term @xmath143 is the usual acceleration term which has been tested by kasevich and chu @xcite .",
    "this term is independent of the initial state of the atom .",
    "all momenta contribute to the effect in the same manner . +",
    "although our derivation and result are quantum mechanically exact we can rewrite the result _ formally _ in terms of classical notions : introducing the `` length '' @xmath144 and the `` height '' @xmath145 the acceleration term reads @xmath146 .",
    "this result is identical to the famous cow phase shift ( this has been observed also by bord @xcite ) .",
    "however , this is purely formal , because there is neither an operational separation of the atom beams @xcite nor an operational realisation of a `` height '' or a `` length '' of the interferometer . the only experimentally given entities ( which is given in classical terms ) are the mean velocity of the atom beam , the wave vector of the laser beams , and the time between the laser pulses .",
    "it is remarkable that in the case of uniform acceleration ( @xmath147 ) the measured probability does not depend either on the mass or on the internal structure of the atom .",
    "this means that in this case the weak ep in the usual sense is exactly valid @xcite .",
    "the mass dependence of the wave function ( [ g - solution ] ) is no indication for a break - down of the weak ep ofr observable effects .",
    "+ however , in general the phase shift ( [ mzphase1 ] ) depends on the second derivative of the newtonian potential and so on the mean velocity @xmath148 of the atoms in the moment of the first @xmath85-pulse ( for higher - order expansions of the newtonian potential we get additional terms of the form @xmath149 , etc . )",
    "@xmath148 is determined by the initial state @xmath150 which is represented by @xmath151 .",
    "the occurrence of such terms makes it necessary to include the notion of the initial state into a formulation of a qep .",
    "note that the initial state does not contain any information about the mass parameter of the quantum system used for the interference ; mass is determined only dynamically .",
    "+ since the mass @xmath152 appears in the observable total phase shift ( [ mzphase1 ] ) the weak ep is not valid .",
    "however , the corresponding term @xmath153 is the only one which is nonlinear in the transferred momentum @xmath154 .",
    "terms linear in the transferred momentum are independent of the mass of the quantum system and therefore obey the weak ep .",
    "the non - linear term may be interpreted as follows : the phase shift measures the acceleration of the two split atomic waves .",
    "however , the second wave feels another acceleration than the first one .",
    "the acceleration the second wave feels depends on the ` kick ' @xmath154 it gains .",
    "( in classical terms : the larger the ` kick ' @xmath154 , the larger the ` separation ' of the two waves ) .",
    "therefore the position dependence of the acceleration , that is , a newtonian curvature , leads to a mass dependence of interference experiments .",
    "+ however , and that is the main point in our discussion of the phase shift ( [ mzphase1 ] ) , the qep is valid : we take as input the norm of the wave vector @xmath155",
    ". then the input independent phase shift is given by ( @xmath156 ) @xmath157 this input independent phase shift is valid in an arbitrarily curved space - time .",
    "it depends on the initial state via the expectation value of the velocity at the first beam splitter and does not depend on the mass of the atoms .",
    "therefore the _ qep is valid for atom beam interferometry _ based on ( [ schroedinger ] ) .",

    "+ the most important consequence of the validity of the qep is that also in interference experiments the influence of the newtonian potential on the interference fringes ( in the input independent form ) does not depend on the used quantum matter at all .",
    "therefore this influence is characterised completely by the environment , and not by the quantum system",
    ". consequently , also in the quantum domain the experimental results show up the geometric nature of the gravitational interaction .",
    "this reflects the geometric nature of the minimal coupling procedure of the klein - gordon or of the dirac equation which in the non - relativistic limit gives the schrdinger equation we are dealing with .",

    "we have just seen that ( [ schroedinger ] ) automatically fulfills the qep . in order to perform an experimental test of the qep we have to introduce into ( [ schroedinger ] ) the inertial mass @xmath158 and ( passive ) gravitational mass @xmath45 where the quantity ` mass ' has to be interpreted quantum mechanically as some quantum property of the quantum state . the coerresponding shift ( [ mzphase1 ] )",
    "will be modified : @xmath159 the corresponding input independent phase shift then tests the equality of inertial and gravitational mass if one makes interference experiments with different kinds of atoms .",
    "this means that the equality of inertial and gravitational mass indicates the validity of the qep .",
    "note that this can be tested even in curved space - time and that it is not necessary ( and in general not possible ) to transform away gravity .",
    "+ for a _ homogeneous _ gravitational field we get @xmath160 so that in this case the qep is equivalent to the weak ep .",
    "+ a way to test the qep is to take different types of atoms , say type @xmath161 and type @xmath162 .",
    "then one can test whether the phase shift for a given gravitational acceleration will be the same for all atoms . if this is done , then for the accuracy @xmath163 of the kasevich - chu interferometer of about @xmath164 a null experiment will give the validity of the equivalence principle in the quantum domain in terms of the etvs ratio @xmath165 to an accuracy of the same order @xmath166 .",

    "such an experiment will be a _ pure quantum test of the equivalence principle_. ( for bulk matter the weak ep is verified to the order @xmath167 @xcite ) . in general , the effect of @xmath102 has to be taken into account by performing this experiment . + there is another way to test the ep : for an accelerated observer we have to replace @xmath168 by @xmath169 with the resulting phase shift @xmath170 .",
    "therefore , one can test the equality of inertial and gravitational mass first by carrying out an interference experiment in a homogeneous gravitational field @xmath101 and second by doing the same experiment with an accelerating interferometer with @xmath171 .",

    "@xmath173 the phase shift ( [ mzphase1 ] ) does not depend on the mass @xmath152 so that in this case the qep is valid .",

    "there is no @xmath174 in the phase shift at all and the corresponding phase shift is an exact quantum result without any approximation .",
    "@xmath173 in our context means that the quantum nature of the momentum transfer is neglected .",
    "+ if we ignore the quantum nature of the momentum transfer by e.g. introducing formally the velocity @xmath175 which the quantum system acquires , then there is no @xmath174 at all in the phase shift .",
    "this means that if we describe the quantum system only by those quantities ( @xmath176 , @xmath177 , and @xmath178 ) which are given experimentally and if we disregard the quantum origin of @xmath179 , then the equations for the phase shift do not contain any @xmath174 .",

    "the respective interaction hamiltonian reads @xmath180 . adding this interaction to the hamiltonian ( [ schroedinger ] )",
    "gives in first order an additional phase shift for the kasevich - chu interferometer @xmath181 .",
    "the corresponding input independent phase shift clearly depends on the specific charge @xmath182 and therefore violates the qep .",

    "the phase shift is given by @xmath185 .",
    "we expand again the potential @xmath44 to second order in the position . in the mach - zehnder geometry ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) we get for the intensity of one outgoing beam @xmath186 with the phase shift @xmath187 where @xmath188 is the length , @xmath189 the vector between the beam splitter @xmath190 and the mirror @xmath191 , and @xmath192 the group velocity of the neutron beam at the beam splitter .",
    "we calculated ( [ neutronphase ] ) by taking into account the ballistic trajectory of the classical particle ( curved lines in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) where we oriented the distance @xmath193 along constant potential @xmath44 and the distances @xmath194 and @xmath195 parallel to the gravitational acceleration @xmath196 .",
    "we calculated the trajectory between @xmath190 and @xmath197 using the acceleration @xmath198 and the trajectory between @xmath191 and @xmath199 using @xmath200 with @xmath201 .",
    "the reflection at the mirrors @xmath197 and @xmath191 are adjusted so that both paths meet at the same point @xmath199 where the two beams recombine and interfere .",
    "this might physically be accomplished by bending the ` ears ' of the bonse - hart interferometer .",
    "( we neglected terms of the form @xmath202 . )",
    "it can be shown that the phase shift for neutron interferometry can also be cast into a form which exhibits the validity of our qep .",
    "one way to show this is to treat the scattering of the neutrons at the crystal layers explicitely . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the scattered neutron ray has the form @xmath203 where @xmath204 is the wave vector of the incoming neutron wave and @xmath9 and @xmath205 are some constants depending on the material of the crystal and on the wave vector .",
    "the wave vector @xmath206 of the scattered wave has to fulfill a bragg condition which means that the direction of the outgoing wave vector is given by @xmath207 where @xmath208 is the reciprocal lattice vector near the ewald sphere given by the momentum of the incoming neutron .",
    "we also have momentum conservation @xmath209 .",
    "this wave vector corresponds to a group velocity @xmath210 .",
    "therefore the reflected wave has a wave vector which is determined by the mirror used .",
    "this wave vector can be used to rewrite the phase shift formula for neutrons . first we replace @xmath188 by the interaction time @xmath177 which is the flight time of the horizontal part from @xmath190 to @xmath197 ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) within the neutron interferometer through @xmath211 .",
    "in addition we can rewrite @xmath212 where @xmath213 is the flight time from @xmath190 to @xmath191 and from @xmath197 to @xmath199 .",
    "@xmath214 is the velocity of the neutron after reflection at the mirror @xmath190 or @xmath197 .",
    "according to the setup of the cow experiment @xmath204 lies in the direction of constant @xmath215 so that @xmath216 and @xmath217 . with @xmath207",
    "we have @xmath218 and @xmath219 .",
    "@xmath220 plays the analogous role of @xmath176 in atom beam interferometry .",
    "therefore , in terms of wave mechanics only , that is , in terms of the interaction time @xmath177 , the flight time @xmath213 and the reciprocal lattice vector @xmath208 which is an experimentally given quantity depending on the preparation of the mirror , the phase shift is @xmath221    we add a few points of discussion :    1 .",
    "this is only an approximate result .",
    "the approximations employed are the quasi  classical limit ( approximation by plane waves ) , second order in the acceleration @xmath101 and first order in @xmath102 .",
    "the first term is the cow phase shift @xcite which in our reformulation does not depend on @xmath174 and on the mass @xmath152 .",
    "the reason for this is that the above phase shift is a reformulation of the usual form of the phase shift in terms of notions of wave mechanics only .",
    "no notions from classical physics like path , enclosed area , height , or length of the interferometer are used . only by introducing these classical notions",
    "do the mass and @xmath174 enter .",
    "( note that only the ratio @xmath222 enters eqn ( [ neutronphase ] ) which is connected to the fact that only this ratio effectively appears in the schrdinger equation ( [ schroedinger ] ) .",
    "this is also of experimental significance @xcite . )",
    "the total phase shift contains terms which depend on the mass @xmath152 of the neutrons .",
    "however , the input independent result @xmath223 does not depend on the mass of the neutrons anymore and therefore fulfills the qep .",
    "( the limit @xmath224 can certainly not be realised by the bonse - hart single - crystal interferometer .",
    "however , using microfabricated gratings as neutron optical elements this limit can be reached . )",
    "4 .   in the case of uniform acceleration",
    "the phase shift depends on the mass in contrast to atom beam interferometry .",
    "this is due to the fact that the mirrors in atom beam interferometry do change the modulus of the momentum while the mirrors in neutron interferometry are momentum conserving .",
    "the phase shift ( [ neutronmz ] ) obeys the ep for @xmath225 .",
    "the corresponding remarks in the case of atom beam interferometry hold here too .",
    "it is clear that the phase shift ( [ neutronphase ] ) or ( [ neutronmz ] ) can not be transformed away by choosing an accelerating reference frame .",
    "consequently , the strong ep is not valid for neutron interferometry , neither .",
    "therefore we have proved that the qep is valid for atom as well as for neutron interferometry .",
    "next we show that it is also possible to use the qep to determine the structure of the interaction of the quantum system with gravitational and inertial fields .",
    "by means of the above result it is easy to reconstruct the gravitational interaction term in the schrdinger equation .",
    "the procedure employed is exactly analogous to that used in newtonian mechanics for structureless point particles : first the force is defined as @xmath226 where @xmath152 is the inertial mass and @xmath227 the acceleration .",
    "the weak ep describes the experimental result that the path or the acceleration of the point particles does not depend on any parameters characterising the structureless point particle .",
    "therefore the ratio @xmath228 does not depend on the mass , charge etc .",
    "consequently , the equation of motion of the point particle in a gravitational field is given by @xmath229 where @xmath230 does not depend on properties of the point particle .",
    "if we assume in addition that the force can be represented by a potential @xmath231 then we arrive at the equation of motion for point particles in a newtonian potential : @xmath2 .    in a similar way we can proceed in the case of matter wave interferometry : we take as hamiltonian @xmath232 where in addition to a general scalar interaction @xmath233 we have also inserted a vector interaction @xmath234 and a tensor interaction @xmath235 ; the latter , for simplicity , is assumed to be constant . to assure the hermiticity of the hamiltonian we assume in additon that @xmath236 , @xmath237 , and @xmath235 are real .",
    "in addition , we have used a symmetrisation procedure .",
    "the mass @xmath152 is a constant characterising the type of quantum particles used ( we do not consider spin ) .",
    "we expand the scalar interaction to second order in the position and the vector interaction to first order . generalising the above procedure according to this generalised interaction we get as input invariant phase shift for",
    "an atom beam interferometric experiment @xmath238 an experimental verification of the qep implies that the above result is independent of the mass of the atom for all chosen values of @xmath177 and @xmath239 .",
    "this forces one to conclude that @xmath240 , @xmath241 , @xmath242 , and @xmath243 are independent of the mass ( note that @xmath244 drops out of the result ) .",
    "consequently , we can introduce @xmath245 , @xmath246 , and @xmath247 where @xmath100 and @xmath248 are independend of @xmath152 .",
    "thus , disregarding a constant , we have to insert @xmath249 and @xmath250 as interaction term into the schrdinger equation based on ( [ reconstructionham ] ) : @xmath251 where @xmath100 , @xmath234 , and @xmath248 do not depend on any properties of the quantum matter .",
    "therefore we have derived that a universally coupling scalar potential must be multiplied by @xmath152 , a universally coupling vector potential is not to be multiplied by @xmath152 while a universally coupling tensor potential must be divided by @xmath152 .",
    "thereby @xmath152 is exactly that parameter which appears as denominator in the kinetic part of the schrdinger equation .",
    "the various interaction terms can be interpreted as follows :    1 .",
    "the scalar mass - independent potential @xmath100 is to be identified with the newtonian potential .",
    "the special case @xmath252 can be interpreted as the transition of the hamiltonian to an accelerated observer by means of the transformation @xmath253 together with an additional unitary transformation .",
    "an interaction term of the form @xmath254 with @xmath255 comes into the free schrdinger equation by a transformation @xmath256 .",
    "this is a general time - dependent affine transformation of the coordinates . in the case of an antisymmetric @xmath257",
    "the contribution to the phase shift @xmath258 is the usual sagnac effect @xmath259 rewritten in terms of wave mechanics only .",
    "here we have to identify @xmath260 and @xmath261 formally is the `` area '' enclosed by the `` paths '' of the atoms ( @xmath262 with the `` length '' @xmath263 and the `` height '' @xmath264 ) . the corresponding interaction term in ( [ hansatz ] )",
    "can be written as @xmath265 and describes a special case of the coupling between rotation and total angular momentum ( see @xcite ) . for @xmath176",
    "parallel to @xmath239 this effect vanishes . for a transformation where @xmath266 is a pure trace ,",
    "@xmath267 the transformation describes an expanding interferometer . +",
    "therefore the additional interaction @xmath268 describes the transition to an expanding , rotating or shearing frame of reference provided one demands that for the observed phase shifts the qep is valid .",
    "consequently , all input independent results due to changes of the frame of reference are independent of the properties of the atoms used .",
    "the tensor @xmath269 describes a modification of the euclidean metric in the @xmath0 hypersurface .",
    "however , by means of a coordinate transformation @xmath270 with constant coefficients @xmath271 this tensor can be brought again to a @xmath99-form .",
    "therefore we have derived by means of the qep and of the phase shift the form of the interaction with gravitational and inertial fields in non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "the same procedure applies also to neutron interferometry .",
    "bearing in mind that the schrdinger equation ( [ schroedinger ] ) can be obtained as the non - relativistic limit of the minimally coupled klein - gordon- or dirac - equation , the above result may also be interpreted as an _ operational _ justification of the minimal coupling procedure in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "a more theoretical justification for the minimal coupling procedure has been given by sciama @xcite : on the level of a lagrangian formulation of the dynamics of a matter field he showed that invariance properties of the lagrangian together with other conditions imply that the lagrangian of the matter field should be coupled minimally to the underlying geometry .",
    "for discussing the equivalence principle in the quantum domain it is also of interest to consider the equation of motion for the mean value of the position operator @xmath272 .",
    "the bracket @xmath273 denotes the mean value of the observable @xmath190 for a quantum state @xmath274 . because , for convenience , we are working in the heisenberg picture",
    ", @xmath274 is time - independent and can therefore be identified with the initially prepared state @xmath275 .",
    "we use the schrdinger equation coupled to the newtonian potential ( [ schroedinger ] ) . for our discussion and derivation of the equation for the mean value of the position operator @xmath276 we use the heisenberg equation of motion @xmath277",
    "this equation ( [ schrquanf1 ] ) is independent of any mass so that this relation can not produce any mass dependence in ( [ schrquanf ] ) .",
    "the only thing one has to do in going from ( [ schrquanf1 ] ) to ( [ schrquanf ] ) is to multiply ( [ schrquanf1 ] ) by the initial state @xmath278 , resp .",
    "@xmath275 . however , the preparation of initial states is also independent of any parameter appearing in the dynamical equation .",
    "the initial state is just a function @xmath279 which has to be in some hilbert - space .",
    "therefore we can prepare for atoms , neutron , electrons etc .",
    "the _ same _ initial state . mass and charge are dynamical quantities .",
    "therefore , the path of the mean value of the position operator depends only on the solution of the heisenberg equation of motion ( [ schrquanf1 ] ) with a given potential function @xmath280 and on the choice on an initial state .",
    "consequently , because neither the heisenberg equation of motion for the position operator nor the initial state are mass dependent , _ the qep is valid for the equation for the mean value of the position operator_. for a given initial state the path @xmath281 is independent of any mass parameter appearing in the schrdinger equation .",
    "the mean values for the position operator of neutrons , atoms , and other neutral quantum systems follow the same path provided their initial states are the same .",
    "interaction terms of the form @xmath282 of course lead via the heisenberg equation of motion to a dependence of the path @xmath283 on the specific charge @xmath182 .    in this connection we state once more that although in the case of a homogeneous gravitational field @xmath284 the solution of the schrdinger equation in the schrdinger picture depends on the mass , the path for the mean value of the position operator does not .",
    "the reason for this property is that the quantum state itself is not an observable quantity ; the quantum state may depend on parameters which drop out of the expectation values ( an overall constant phase is a special parameter which trivially drops out )",
    ". only expectation values ( or mean values ) are observables .    of course , the path @xmath281 fulfilling ( [ schrquanf ] ) does not coincide with the respective path of a classical particle given by @xmath285 , that is , @xmath286 does not lead to an autonomous system .",
    "the difference of these two paths is of the order @xmath287 which vanishes in the classical limit .",
    "it is well known that for a potential @xmath288 ( [ diff ] ) vanishes exactly so that the weak ep in its usual sense is valid .",
    "it can be shown in addition that the expectation value of each operator @xmath289 using the solutions ( [ gravsol ] ) does not depend on the mass @xmath152 .",
    "this means that although the quantum state explicitely depends on the mass all expectation values of mass independent operators do not depend on the mass .",
    "one can also show that the time evolution of the uncertainties @xmath290 and @xmath291 do depend on the initial state only and not on the mass .",
    "consequently , also for the uncertainties the qep is valid .",
    "the main aim of this paper was to find a useful notion of an equivalence principle in the quantum domain .",
    "we proposed a qep which states that the output of a physical experiment in its input independent form only depends on the chosen initial state and not on the mass parameter appearing in the dynamical equation ( in our case the schrdinger equation ) for the quantum system ( atoms , neutrons , electrons , etc . ) . consequently ,",
    "even in the quantum domain we have found a way to extract results from the outcome of experiments where _ gravity acts universally _ in the sense that the gravitational influence does not depend on the mass of the quantum system .",
    "this means that even in the quantum domain the gravitational interaction is characterised completely by the environment , and not at all by the quantum system .",
    "the main implication of this is that even in the quantum domain the _ gravitational interaction can be geometrised _ in a well - defined manner .",
    "we can also interpret our approach in an operational manner . by means of our proposed qep",
    "it is possible to decide from the outcome of e.g. an interference experiment whether there are interactions which act universally , i.e. which are independent of parameters characterising the used quantum system .",
    "these universal acting interaction fields may be called gravitational and inertial fields .",
    "therefore our procedure is capable to _ define gravitational fields in the quantum domain operationally_.    it is of course desirable to extend the above considerations to the relativistic case .",
    "also particles with spin should be included .",
