    "despite numerous experimental and theoretical studies since the discovery  @xcite of high temperature superconductivity ( htsc ) in cuprates in 1986 , there is still no consensus on the superconducting mechanism in these materials . with enormous advances in growth of high - quality single crystals ,",
    "however , a qualitatively common phase diagram has emerged ( fig .",
    "[ pdia ] ) .",
    "the phase diagram exhibits different states of matter , many of which are revealed by neutron scattering  @xcite .",
    "only when novel properties of htsc cuprates are fully elucidated across the whole phase diagram will a full understanding of these materials be gained .",
    "the search for new phases of matter is particularly important in the low doping region close to critical doping for superconductivity , @xmath6 , because it creates the greatest challenge for theory .",
    "the undoped htsc parent materials are believed to be mott - insulators with static long - range three dimensional ( 3d ) antiferromagnetic ( af ) order below a nel temperature t@xmath7 .",
    "the cu@xmath8 spins are localized with strong af exchange coupling within 2d cuo@xmath0 planes .",
    "the weak exchange coupling in the perpendicular direction allows the 3d nel order to occur at a finite t@xmath7 .",
    "initially , hole doping disrupts the network of correlated , localized cu@xmath8 spins and suppresses antiferromagnetism .",
    "further hole doping leads to superconductivity for doping larger than the critical doping @xmath6 @xmath50.05 ( underdoped region ) .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature t@xmath3 increases with increasing doping and reaches a maximum at an optimal doping beyond which t@xmath3 declines .",
    "even though long - range af order does not coexist with superconductivity in this region , strong spin fluctuations nonetheless survive well into the superconducting ( sc ) phase .",
    "electronic properties more like conventional metals are exhibited at very high doping ( overdoped region ) but also in the underdoped region by the observation of quantum oscillations and fermi surface reconstruction  @xcite in the range 0.08@xmath9@xmath4@xmath90.15 .",
    "our results address a much lower doping region where superconductivity is weak and spin fluctuations are strong .    the single - layer la@xmath10sr@xmath11cuo@xmath12 ( lsco ) cuprate family has been extensively studied by neutron scattering  @xcite .",
    "the doped lsco system intrinsically suffers from disorder very close to the cuo@xmath0 planes in which both sc and af occur .",
    "this is because doping involves substitution of la with sr ions of different charge in layers directly adjacent to the cuo@xmath0 planes .",
    "this chemical substitution inevitably introduces disorder into the cuo@xmath0 planes which in turn distorts the cuo@xmath0 planes . for the bilayer yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath13 ( ybco6+x ) system , where large and high - quality single crystals are available , doping occurs by varying the oxygen content in the cuo chains which are located far from the cuo@xmath0 planes .",
    "the ybco6+x system thus provides an intrinsically less disordered environment , where holes are introduced in the conducting plane by out - of - plane oxygen doping , that can reveal how doping affects the planar magnetic and superconducting properties .",
    "muon spin rotation ( @xmath14sr ) studies of underdoped ybco6+x have led to the claim  @xcite that a transition takes place to nel order within the superconducting dome .",
    "as well , a transition to a frozen glass is claimed at an even lower temperature .",
    "one must emphasize that the @xmath14sr technique is a local probe whereas neutron scattering allows one to determine the length and time scales of the magnetic structure as it evolves with temperature and doping .",
    "since there is little consensus on the nature of the precursor phase from which the sc phase emerges , we have undertaken a systematic neutron scattering study of high - quality ybco6+x single crystals that lie close to the critical doping for superconductivity ( see fig .",
    "[ pdia ] ) .",
    "our earlier experiments on ybco6.35 ( t@xmath3=18 k , @xmath4=0.06 ) revealed that no long - range bragg - ordered af phase coexists with superconductivity  @xcite .",
    "the short - range static spin correlations observed for ybco6.35 leaves open the possibility that an af quantum critical point or novel phase might occur at lower doping .",
    "we have therefore studied an even lower doped ybco6+x , namely ybco6.33 with t@xmath3 of only 8.4 k and doping @xmath4=0.055 near the critical @xmath6=0.052 .",
    "we will present clear evidence for the existence of spatially highly - correlated and slow spin fluctuations .",
    "although the observations are qualitatively similar to higher doped ybco6.35 ( t@xmath3=18 k )  @xcite , these are the first measurements on ybco6.33 with such a low t@xmath3 , and we will show that even for such low doped yet superconducting materials , long - range antiferromagnetic order and superconductivity do not coexist .",
    "the experiments were performed on large single crystals prepared at university of british columbia ( ubc ) by a top - seeded melt growth technique  @xcite . the crystals",
    "each of volume @xmath51 @xmath15 were well annealed and in the orthorhombic phase with room temperature lattice parameters @xmath16=3.844  , @xmath17=3.870   ( for data analysis purposes we take @xmath16=@xmath17=@xmath183.857  ) , and @xmath19=11.791  .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature , t@xmath3 , was determined to be 5 k after the crystal growth and rising to 8.4 k after further annealing for several months at room temperature at chalk river .",

    "the lack of temperature dependence above @xmath580 k justifies attribution of the growing scattering at low temperatures to the magnetic scattering .",

    "these lorentzians describe the 3d correlations along l and their relative intensities , @xmath52 , are allowed to vary independently . because fitting of @xmath50 to an h - scan involves resolution convolution over a known l width ( @xmath53 ) , and vice versa , we iterated to ensure that a consistent set of @xmath50 and @xmath53 were fitted to the two data scans ( figs .

    "however the peak intensity at h=0.52 has fallen by only 1.3 , much less that than the factor @xmath56 expected for a lorentzian dependence in q compared with the chosen offset of dh=0.02 r.l.u equivalent to dq = 0.045 @xmath77 where dq@xmath80@xmath50 = 4.5 .",
    "the fact that the dynamic susceptibility holds up as q is displaced from * * q**@xmath79 shows the tendency , even at this very low doping , for the spin strength to be slightly weighted towards incommensurate wavevectors as also suggested by fig .",
    "[ fig11](b ) .",
    "moreover , for all energy scans up to 40 mev there is no sign of any other spectral feature that can be associated with the so - called resonance observed in samples with higher doping .",
    "0 cm      since one could argue that the transition to the superconducting state prevents further growth of the central mode at low temperatures ( i.e. prevents a transition to a long - range af state ) ,",
    "we suppressed the superconductivity by applying a magnetic field of 7.5 t parallel to the [ 1@xmath210 ] direction . t@xmath3 is reduced to 2.5 k from 8.4 k at 7.5 t as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) .",
    "detailed measurements of the elastic scattering along [ hh0 ] and [ 00l ] directions through ( 0.5 0.5 2 ) at 1.5 k are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] and the temperature dependence of the central mode intensity is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) .",
    "our standard method of high - temperature background subtraction was used .",
    "these measurements demonstrate that the central mode ( intensity , q - profile and peak widths ) and its temperature dependence are unaffected by the application of 7.5 t magnetic field , even though the system remains in its normal phase down to 2.5 k. it appears that the static spins in the central mode evolve separately from the charges that pair below 8.4 k.    in fig .",
    "[ fig15](a - e ) we show that the spin fluctuations both in q and in e are also unchanged by the applied field of 7.5 t. these observations and the absence of an anomaly in both elastic and inelastic scattering at t@xmath3 confirm that superconducting properties play an unobservable influence on the very strong spin glassy correlations and their excitations .",
    "we do not probe the region near 0.8 mev , where a field enhancement at 6 t was seen  @xcite in ybco6.35 .",
    "this region is close to the strong elastic line and is hard to probe with the lower - resolution thermal neutrons .",
    "there is possibly very tentative evidence of a field enhancement near 1 mev ( fig .",
    "[ fig15]e ) .    the lack of field dependence in both elastic and inelastic magnetic scattering in ybco6.33 contrasts with the lsco system  @xcite . in lsco , for underdoped samples with a sr concentration of x@xmath810.15 ,",
    "the incommensurate magnetic scattering is enhanced  @xcite by application of a magnetic field . in the low doped superconducting la@xmath10ba@xmath11cuo@xmath12 with x=0.095",
    "it was found  @xcite that the incommensurate magnetic scattering is unaffected by magnetic fields up to 7 t applied along the c - axis .",
    "the lack of a field effect in this system compared to the presence of strong field dependence in lsco was used to suggest  @xcite that the field effect is not a universal property of cuprate superconductors .",
    "experiments on more highly - doped ybco6.45 with t@xmath3=35 k have revealed  @xcite a strong enhancement of static incommensurate magnetic order at low temperatures by a magnetic field of @xmath515 t applied mainly perpendicular to the cuo@xmath0 planes .",
    "it was also found that the field reduces the amplitude of the inelastic response around @xmath53 mev compensating for the spectral weight accumulated in the elastic peak .",
    "a similar field - induced suppression of the intensity is well known  @xcite for the resonance mode in more highly doped ybco6.6 .",
    "based on these results it has been suggested  @xcite that the field enhanced magnetic superstructure is expected to drive a reconstruction of the fermi surface which ultimately could explain the unusual fermi surface topology revealed by recent quantum - oscillation experiments  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments on lower doped ybco6.35 have instead shown  @xcite a magnetic field induced enhancement of the low energy spin fluctuations .",
    "this enhancement was suggested  @xcite to be the result of free spins located close to the hole - rich regions .",
    "clearly further experiments are required in order to determine whether there is a common magnetic field dependence for the static and dynamic scattering as a function of doping in ybco and other cuprates , but the initial results suggest otherwise .",
    "we find that in ybco6.33 only short - range af correlations are present . despite the near - critical doping",
    ", the system lies inside the superconducting phase but outside any antiferromagnetic ordered phase .",
    "the spins fluctuate on two energy scales : one a damped spin response with a @xmath53 mev relaxation rate and the other a resolution limited and intense peak at zero energy transfer ( central mode ) . even though we observe no transition to a long - range af state",
    ", we demonstrate that the spins are highly correlated and exhibit an imprint of three - dimensional ordering with finite correlation lengths .",
    "the central mode develops gradually on cooling but does not diverge and the system remains subcritical .",
    "we find no evidence for a phase transition such as a nel anomaly ( figs .",
    "[ fig2](b ) and  [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "the intensity of the central mode saturates on cooling below @xmath51015 k , with a concomitant minimum in the central mode peak widths .",
    "the presence of zero energy spin correlations over a finite wavevector fraction of the brillouin zone is enough to prevent a transition to 3d long - range order .",
    "the central mode is centered on commensurate af positions ( 0.5 0.5 l ) with integral l indicating the development of weak 3d spin correlations along the c direction .",
    "the af elastic correlations extend over only @xmath530 cells in the ab - plane and @xmath51 cell along the c - axis",
    ". the short - range nature of the correlations can be understood by the af frustration due to the doped holes .",
    "the doped holes produce extensive regions which break up the af coupling and likely create ferromagnetic correlations between spins connected by oxygen neighbours in the cuo@xmath0 planes where holes reside .",
    "this frustration leads to a spin - glass state .",
    "such frustration becomes more significant at low temperatures when the ferromagnetic bonds become frozen and thereby exert a nonzero average field on the regions of af correlated spins .",
    "the correlations are broadened on warming and the integral - in - l pattern becomes centered on the maxima of the bilayer structure factor , so indicating that 3d coupling between bilayers is vanishing .",
    "the avoidance of a quantum critical transition to 3d antiferromagnetism ( divergence of the central mode intensity ) is possibly related to breaking of the weakest coupling in the system , the antiparallel orientation of the spin of the upper member of the bilayer in one cell with the lower member of the bilayer in the next cell up along c. this is also evident from the shorter correlation length along c than the ab - plane .",
    "there have been several suggestions for the local texture that gives rise to the central mode .",
    "haas et al .",
    "suggested  @xcite skyrmions but we find the skirt around the base of the central peak is hard to differentiate from our excellent lorentzian fits . some have suggested  @xcite spin spirals .",
    "aharony et al . suggested  @xcite spin canting in the plane as frustration that destroys the nel order at such a low doping .",
    "it is known that a doped hole , forms a zhang - rice singlet  @xcite that neutralizes a cu spin .",
    "since the doped hole extends over four or more oxygen sites , it is far more effective in destroying the long - range af , reducing t@xmath7 and magnetic moment , than simply a magnetic - site dilution . to date",
    "the local texture around a hole has not been established .",
    "the in - plane correlation length of about 100   is much larger than the hole spacing expected for a 2d system with doping @xmath4=0.055 , @xmath82=@xmath83=16  .",
    "the correlation seems to lie closer with @xmath4=0.055 to a critical behaviour @xmath82=@xmath84=70  .",
    "this is not unexpected as the spin system is becoming more three - dimensional as @xmath6 is approached .",
    "the trend with doping of the correlation range is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] .",
    "the inverse correlation lengths along both directions track t@xmath3 without any sign of impending divergence at @xmath6 .",
    "it is remarkable that reducing doping by only about 10@xmath85 more than doubles the correlation lengths ( see table .",
    "[ corrvsdoping ] ) indicating high sensitivity of the static magnetic correlations to doping in this region .",
    "the closely coupled in - plane and out - of plane spin evolution we find suggests a highly organized structure rather than doping disorder .",
    "we also note that the development in q , @xmath30 , and t of spin fluctuations is reminiscent of approach to a 3d phase transition and unlike what may occur in a system with disorder or random impurities . from a linear extrapolation of",
    "the @xmath86 observed for ybco6.35 and ybco6.33 ( fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] ) , we suggest a true 3d long - range af order to take place outside of sc dome at a doping lower than @xmath6=0.052 .",
    "this suggestion is limited by the experimental accuracy , and is only possible because of the superb control of doping in the growth procedure used by the ubc group .",
    "moreover there is little sign of a dynamic slowing of the spins as doping is reduced from ybco6.35 to ybco6.33 .",
    "evidently @xmath6 is a critical doping for the sc pairing , but not for the af spin order .",

    "<S> neutron scattering from high - quality yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 ( ybco6.33 ) single crystals with a t@xmath3 of 8.4 k shows no evidence of a coexistence of superconductivity with long - range antiferromagnetic order at this very low , near - critical doping of @xmath4@xmath50.055 . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find short - range three dimensional spin correlations that develop at temperatures much higher than t@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> their intensity increases smoothly on cooling and shows no anomaly that might signify a nel transition . </S>",
    "<S> the system remains subcritical with spins correlated over only one and a half unit cells normal to the planes . at low energies </S>",
    "<S> the short - range spin response is static on the microvolt scale . </S>",
    "<S> the excitations out of this ground state give rise to an overdamped spectrum with a relaxation rate of 3 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the transition to the superconducting state below t@xmath3 has no effect on the spin correlations . </S>",
    "<S> the elastic interplanar spin response extends over a length that grows weakly but fails to diverge as doping is moved towards the superconducting critical point . </S>",
    "<S> any antiferromagnetic critical point likely lies outside the superconducting dome . </S>",
    "<S> the observations suggest that conversion from nel long - range order to a spin glass texture is a prerequisite to formation of paired superconducting charges . </S>",
    "<S> we show that while @xmath6 = 0.052 is a critical doping for superconducting pairing , it is not for spin order . </S>"
