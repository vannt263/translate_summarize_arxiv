    "the introduction of a background electromagnetic field can have very important consequences for neutrino physics . while the standard model neutrino does not itself couple to an electromagnetic field , the effects of such a field on neutrinos are made manifest through their interactions with charged particles , real or virtual .",
    "specifically , many investigations have calculated the effects of a constant magnetic field on neutrino propagation and interactions .",
    "recent areas of interest for such calculations include : the neutrino self - energy @xcite , the @xmath1-@xmath2-@xmath1 vertex @xcite , nucleon interactions @xcite , neutrino - photon scattering @xcite , and neutrino - electron interactions @xcite .",
    "a very nice review of these examples and their astrophysical effects has been prepared by bhattacharya and pal @xcite .    in this article",
    "we examine electron - positron pair production through the process @xmath0 .",
    "though normally forbidden , the electromagnetic field alters the final states of the electron - positron pair and frees the interaction to take place .",
    "such a process could have very significant astrophysical and cosmological ramifications .",
    "_  have proposed that this interaction could be important in the analysis of supernovas and neutron star coalescence , and they have offered its role in magnetars as a possible explanation for gamma ray bursts @xcite .",
    "such effects are important because of the magnetic field strengths associated with these phenomena .",
    "for example , neutron stars and supernovae can have fields in excess of @xmath3 @xcite , while a magnetar s field is of order @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "we , however , turn our focus to examining the production of pairs with neutrinos within more terrestrial fields .",
    "we investigate the feasibility of detecting @xmath0 events using ultrashort pulsed lasers . though not approaching the astronomical magnetic fields , today s femtosecond terawatt lasers can produce field strengths on the order of @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) @xcite .",
    "we begin by presenting a review of the derivation of the volkov field operator solution for the electron(positron ) in an circularly polarized electromagnetic field ( section  [ sec : derive ] ) .",
    "next , we apply this volkov solution to the calculation of the production rate for the process @xmath0 ( section  [ sec : prodrate ] ) .",
    "lastly , we provide a tabulation of production rates for various incoming neutrino energies in the laser field and estimate the likelihood of detecting such a process ( section  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "as was pointed out in section  [ sec : intro ] , any effect an electromagnetic field has on standard model neutrino physics is due to interaction with charged particles in the interaction . for our process",
    "we incorporate the laser s intense field into the problem by using the field operator solution of the electron in the presence of an electromagnetic plane wave .",
    "we begin by solving the dirac equation for such a case @xmath7 we choose the electromagnetic field to be circularly polarized and directed along the @xmath8-direction such that the 4-vector potential @xmath9 is @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the magnitude of the vector potential and @xmath12 is the 4-momentum directed along the @xmath8-direction . the choice of circularly polarized light as already been pointed out to be a much simpler approach than assuming linearly or ecliptically polarized light @xcite .",

    "equation  ( [ eq : deltafunc ] ) also suggests that we interpret the @xmath62 term as a number of photons that are pulled from the laser field in order to drive this reaction .",
    "these photons are what allow this process to overcome the energy and momentum constraints that originally prohibited this reaction in the free - field case . in fact , the @xmath48-function can be used to apply a constraint on the possible values for @xmath63 @xmath64 in the proceeding calculation we will take the neutrino and laser beams to be oppositely directed . therefore , in the massless limit of the neutrino the constraint equation  ( [ eq : nconstraint ] ) becomes @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the energy carried per photon .",
    "we note that the reaction can not emit photons ( @xmath67 ) , nor can it proceed without absorbing some number of photons ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "the @xmath55-matrix can now be rewritten as @xmath69 where we have absorbed the couplings , spinors , bessel functions , etc .",
    ", into the scattering matrix @xmath70",
    ". for a definition of @xmath70 refer to the appendix .    of importance , however , is the square of the @xmath55-matrix .",

    "therefore , we can replace @xmath74 with the square of the norm of the scattering amplitude @xmath75 and eliminate the sum over @xmath76 @xmath77 to simplify the result , we have defined the square of the scattering matrix after summing and averaging over spins to be @xmath78    next , we can use three of the @xmath48-functions to eliminate the integral over the momentum of the incoming neutrino @xmath79 or @xmath80 this still leaves us with two identical energy - conserving @xmath48-functions . to simplify",

    "our calculation proceeds by computing the individual production rates @xmath87 ( equation  ( [ eq : prn ] ) ) and then summing to find the total rate @xmath30 ( equation  ( [ eq : totalpr ] ) ) .",
    "though the constraint in equation  ( [ eq : nconstraint2 ] ) imposes a lower bound on the summation over @xmath63 for the total rate , there is no such upper bound .",
    "this means that the calculation should include computations of the individual production rates for @xmath63 out to infinity .",
    "fortunately , the individual production rates @xmath87 fall off exponentially for large @xmath63 .",
    "how fast ( or slowly ) these rates fall off depends on what choices are made for the incoming photon energy @xmath66 and the magnitude of the vector potential @xmath11 .",
    "for the cases in which the individual rates fall off slowly , we calculate the rates to sufficiently large @xmath63 such that we can characterize the nature of the exponential decay .",
    "using this characterization to fit the rates at large @xmath63 allows us to approximate the summation .",
    "we choose initial conditions that closely approximate today s high - intensity laser system .",
    "these conditions are based on the terawatt high - intensity optical research ( thor ) laser at the high intensity laser science group at the university of texas at austin .",
    "the thor laser is a @xmath88 laser beam centered around a wavelength of @xmath89 with an electric field strength @xmath90 on the order of @xmath91 @xcite . for our calculations we choose an electric field strength of @xmath92 .",
    "the choice of wavelength and electric field strength uniquely specify the electromagnetic field parameters in our problem . using the customary relationships , the photon energy is @xmath93 and the magnitude of the vector potential is @xmath94    the profile of the individual production rates @xmath87 as a function of the number of photons @xmath63 is given in fig .",

    "notice that for a given choice of photon energy and vector potential magnitude , the profiles shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] all follow the same exponential decay .",
    "the individual rates that make up these profiles are summed in order to find the total production rate ( equation  ( [ eq : totalpr ] ) ) .",
    "we present the results of this summation in table  [ tab : drates ] for a range of neutrino energies from 1gev to 300tev .",
    "the total rate of production is also presented for a laser field that is able to generate the same field strengths but with a much smaller wavelength of light @xmath95 .",
