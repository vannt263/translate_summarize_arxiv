    "with the rapid growth of smart handheld devices and mobile internet services , traffic demand in cellular networks has been growing tremendously @xcite , which causes frequent congestions and imposes a heavy burden on network operators .",
    "a cost effective approach to relieve network congestion is to offload the traffic of mobile users ( mus ) to spatially spread small - cell networks , e.g. , femtocells and wifi access points ( aps ) @xcite@xcite . from the network",
    "operators perspective , offloading traffic can effectively exploit the additional network capacities provided by the multi - tiers small cells and reduce the needs of costly and time - consuming network infrastructure upgrade . from the mus perspective",
    ", offloading traffic reduces their costs , since small cells usually offer a low price for mobile data than cellular operators .",
    "traffic offloading becomes increasing attractive , as an increasing percentage of mobile devices are equipped with multiple radio - interfaces that facilitate to flexibly simultaneous connections to multiple networks @xcite .    in particular , a new paradigm of _ small - cell dual - connectivity _ is gaining momentum in both industry practice @xcite@xcite and the 3gpp lte - a standardizing activities @xcite@xcite .",
    "through the dual - connectivity , each mu can simultaneously communicate with a macro base station ( bs ) and a small - cell ap via two different radio - interfaces .",
    "this enables the mus to flexibly schedule their traffic between two networks to achieve efficient traffic offloading .",
    "for instance , an mu can schedule its delay - sensitive small - volume data traffic ( e.g. , voice - over - ip traffic ) to the macro bs , and offload its delay - tolerant large - volume traffic ( e.g. , file downloading / uploading ) to a small - cell ap at the same time .",
    "nevertheless , different from the centralized resource management and orthogonal channel allocation in cellular networks , a small - cell ap ( such as wifi ) often allows multiple mus to share the same channels in a distributed fashion , which leads to significant mutual interferences among the mus .",
    "it means that if each mu aggressively offloads its traffic to the ap , then each mu needs to spend significant amount of transmit - power to the ap to combat the mutual interferences , which might significantly reduce the benefit from offloading traffic .",
    "several prior studies have taken such interferences into consideration when designing data offloading algorithms @xcite@xcite@xcite . however , the interference - aware traffic offloading design with dual - connectivity is still an open problem .",
    "this problem becomes especially complicated if we consider different transmit - power constraints at each mu s different radio - interfaces @xcite@xcite , which require the mu to carefully allocate its transmit - powers to match the need of the scheduled traffic . to tackle the above challenging problem",
    ", we propose a joint optimization of the traffic scheduling and transmit - power allocations with the mus dual - connectivity .",
    "our contributions can be summarized as follows .    *",
    "_ novel joint optimization formulation : _ we formulate a cost minimization problem , in which each mu jointly determines its traffic scheduling to the ap and bs and the transmit - powers at the two radio - interfaces .",
    "the objective is to minimize the total cost of all mus , while meeting each mu s traffic demand and its transmit - power constraints . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "such a formulation targeted for the mus traffic offloading with dual - connectivity has not been studied before . * _ centralized algorithm design : _ we first propose a centralized algorithm for solving the joint traffic scheduling and power control problem . in spite of non - convexity of the problem",
    ", we perform a series of manipulations to transform the joint optimization into an equivalent sinr - assignment problem ( here sinr denotes the signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ) .",
    "we then explore the _",
    "hidden monotonicity _ of the sinr - assignment problem and design a two - layered algorithm to solve it .",
    "based on the obtained sinrs at the ap , we derive the mus traffic scheduling and transmit - powers to minimize the total cost . * _ distributed algorithm design : _ we next propose a distributed algorithm to solve the joint optimization problem , by focusing on a practically important case that the channel bandwidth of the ap is no smaller than the bs s allocated bandwidth .",
    "in this case , we identify _ the hidden concave minimization property _ of the sinr - assignment problem and propose a distributed algorithm to compute each mu s sinr at the ap .",
    "based on the obtained sinrs at the ap , we derive the mus traffic scheduling and transmit - powers to minimize the total cost in a distributed manner . * _ performance improvement : _ numerical results show that both the proposed algorithms can achieve the close - to - optimum results which are obtained by the lingo ( a commercial optimization software @xcite ) but with a significant less computational complexity .",
    "the numerical results also validate that the proposed traffic offloading can significantly reduce the mus cost , namely , saving more than 75% of the cost without performing any offloading and more than 65% of the cost with a fixed offloading scheme .",

    "since the seminal studies @xcite@xcite , there have been many studies that investigated traffic offloading via infrastructure - based small - cell networks .",
    "they can be roughly categorized into two groups as follows :    * _ network - oriented traffic offloading_. the first group of studies mainly focused on optimizing traffic offloading from the networks perspectives . in @xcite , ho _",
    "considered the inter - cell interference when accommodating the offloaded traffic .",
    "taking into account the coupling effect due to the mutual interference , the authors formulated a utility optimization framework for distributing traffic loads among different macro - cells . in @xcite ,",
    "chen _ et al .",

    "proposed a refund mechanism for network operator to motivate the small - cell aps to admit macro - cell mus for traffic offloading .",
    "* _ user - oriented traffic offloading_. the second group of studies focused on optimizing the traffic offloading from the mus perspectives , with the key issues including interference management and delay - offloading tradeoff . for instance , in @xcite , kang _",
    "_ considered the scenario of one bs and one third - party wifi ap , and investigated how different mus choose either the bs or the ap for offloading traffic .",
    "considering the mutual interference among different mus , the authors formulated the networks - selection problem as a binary nonlinear programming problem for maximizing the system - wise reward .",

    "_ proposed an mu - centric cost - aware wifi offloading system , which considers the mu s throughput - delay tradeoff and cost budget to decide when to offload which type of traffic .    in spite of the above studies , only few studies investigated the paradigm of small - cell dual - connectivity ( which has been gaining momentum in the industry practice @xcite@xcite and the 3gpp lte - a standardizing activities @xcite@xcite ) for offloading the mus traffic .",
    "in @xcite , jha _ et al . _",
    "discussed several technical challenges and potential solution directions regarding the small - cell dual - connectivity in cellular networks . however , to the best of our knowledge , there exists no existing study that investigated the optimal management of the mus traffic scheduling and transmit - power allocations for traffic offloading via the dual - connectivity .",
    "we emphasize that although there are several studies investigating how the traffic offloading can benefit the network operators , it is less understood about how much the mus can benefit from offloading traffic in terms of saving the mobile data cost .",
