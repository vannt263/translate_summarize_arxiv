    "recently , however , it was shown that this picture simplifies drastically for most two - body hadronic decays of @xmath9 mesons into final states containing at least one fast , light meson @xcite . in the heavy - quark limit ,",
    "the decay amplitudes for these processes factorize into a semileptonic form factor and a meson decay constant .",
    "so - called `` nonfactorizable '' corrections are predominantly perturbative and taken into account by convolutions of hard - scattering kernels with light - cone distribution amplitudes of the mesons .",
    "corrections to this limit are suppressed by powers of @xmath3 .",
    "factorization as established in @xcite is a nontrivial property of the decay amplitudes that holds true to all orders of perturbation theory and to leading power in @xmath3 . for practical applications ,",
    "it is important to obtain an estimate of the leading , power - suppressed corrections .",
    "naive dimensional analysis suggests that such corrections are of order @xmath12 ; however , it is difficult to quantify this statement .",
    "the main obstruction is that , in contrast to simpler applications of the heavy - quark expansion to exclusive semileptonic decays or inclusive processes @xcite , the power corrections to factorization can not be organized using a local operator product expansion .",
    "whereas certain types of potentially large corrections were identified and estimated in @xcite , it is not ( yet ) possible to write down the complete set of leading power corrections in terms of field - theoretic objects .",
    "the goal of the present work is to gain some insight into the structure of power corrections arising from soft , `` nonfactorizable '' gluon exchange .",
    "we use the renormalon calculus @xcite to investigate the asymptotic behavior of the perturbation series for the hard - scattering kernels .",
    "these series are divergent and require power corrections of a certain pattern in order to be consistently defined .",
    "the borel transforms of the perturbation series have singularities in the complex plane , whose structure indicates the power ( via their position ) and strength ( via their residues ) of these corrections .",
    "we study renormalon singularities by adopting the `` large-@xmath2 limit '' ( corresponding to the exchange of a single renormalon chain ) , in which nontrivial partial resummations of perturbation series become possible .",
    "this method provides the correct location of the renormalon singularities , but only approximately accounts for their residues .    to illustrate our approach , we recall the example of the adler @xmath13-function , i.e.  the euclidean correlator of two vector currents . for this quantity ,",
    "the leading infrared ( ir ) renormalon singularity arising from soft gluon exchange indicates a power correction of order @xmath14 , which has the same momentum dependence as the contribution of the gluon condensate .",
    "a consistent definition of the perturbation series with an accuracy of order @xmath15 or better therefore requires inclusion of the gluon condensate , and the value of the condensate depends on the resummation prescription ( e.g. , principal - value borel summation , truncation at the minimal term , etc . )",
    "adopted to define the divergent perturbation series @xcite .",
    "although the presence of a @xmath15 power correction proportional to the gluon condensate can be inferred from the operator product expansion , it is remarkable that the perturbation expansion itself signals the existence of this nonperturbative effect through its divergent large - order behavior .",
    "the correspondence of renormalon singularities and power corrections of ( some ) higher - dimensional operators in the operator product expansion has also been verified with several explicit examples in the context of the heavy - quark expansion @xcite .",
    "building on this experience , the renormalon calculus has been applied to observables that do not admit an expansion in local operators .",
    "examples are event - shape variables in @xmath16 annihilation @xcite , drell  yan production @xcite , fragmentation functions @xcite , and structure functions in deep - inelastic scattering @xcite . in these cases , there is no systematic framework that would allow us to classify the power corrections in terms of operator matrix elements .",
    "however , the pattern of renormalon singularities determines at least a minimal set of power corrections that must be included for a consistent field - theoretic description .",
    "although , in general , these are not the only sources of power - suppressed effects , the inclusion of the corrections corresponding to the leading ir renormalons significantly improves the phenomenological predictions .",
