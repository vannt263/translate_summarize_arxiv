    "one of the most exciting breakthroughs in condensed matter physics has been the discovery that there exist quantum phases of matter at zero temperature that can not be described by their pattern of symmetry breaking.@xcite the prototypical and perhaps most well - studied examples of these phases are the fractional quantum hall states,@xcite which exhibit a different kind of order , called topological order.@xcite topologically ordered phases are currently the subject of intense interest because of the possibility of detecting , for the first time , excitations that exhibit non - abelian statistics,@xcite and subsequently manipulating these non - abelian excitations for robust quantum information storage and processing.@xcite    one way to improve our understanding of topological order in the fractional quantum hall states is to study phase transitions between states with different topological order .",
    "while much is known about phase transitions between phases with different patterns of symmetry breaking , much less is known about phase transitions between phases with different topological order . aside from its intrinsic interest , such information may be useful in identifying the topological order of a certain fqh state , which is currently a significant challenge .",
    "the experimental observation of a continuous phase transition in a fqh system may help us identify the topological order of one of the phases if we know theoretically which topologically ordered phases can be connected to each other through a continuous phase transition and which can not .",
    "ultimately , we would like to have an understanding of all of the possible topological orders in fqh states and how they can be related to each other through continuous phase transitions .    we may hope to understand a phase transition between two phases if we have a field theory that describes each phase and we know how the field theories of the two phases are related to each other . in the case of the fractional quantum hall states , it is well - known that the long - distance , low energy behavior is described by certain topological field theories in 2 + 1 dimensions,@xcite called chern - simons theories . for the laughlin states and other abelian fqh states , such as the halperin states , the hierarchy states , and jain states , the long wavelength behavior is described by chern - simons theories with a number of @xmath13 gauge fields.@xcite    for the non - abelian fqh states , the corresponding chern - simons theory has a non - abelian gauge group.@xcite the most well - studied examples of non - abelian fqh states are the moore - read pfaffian state@xcite and some of its generalizations , the read - rezayi ( or @xmath14 parafermion ) states.@xcite the bosonic @xmath15 pfaffian is described by @xmath16 chern - simons theory,@xcite or alternatively , by @xmath17 chern - simons theory,@xcite while the effective theories for the other states are less well - understood .",
    "it has been proposed that the read - rezayi @xmath14 parafermion states are described by @xmath18 chern - simons theory.@xcite    in this paper , we show that chern - simons theory with gauge group @xmath2 describes the long - wavelength properties of the @xmath9 parafermion read - rezayi fqh state .",
    "the significance of this result is that there is a bilayer state , the @xmath19 halperin state at @xmath20 , which may undergo a bilayer to single - layer quantum phase transition to the @xmath9 parafermion state as the interlayer tunneling is increased.@xcite the bilayer phase is described by a @xmath21 chern - simons theory .",
    "this new formulation of the chern - simons theory for the @xmath9 parafermion state may therefore be useful in understanding the phase transition because the gauge groups @xmath0 and @xmath22 are closely related , and because the fields in the @xmath23 theory are more closely related to physical degrees of freedom of the electron fluid than they are in the proposed alternative @xmath24 theory .",
    "in addition to aiding us in understanding this phase transition , this study shows how to compute concretely various topological properties of a chern - simons theory with a disconnected gauge group . for chern - simons theories at level @xmath25 , where the gauge group is a simple lie group @xmath26 ,",
    "there is a straightfoward prescription to compute topological properties .",
    "the different quasiparticles are labelled by the integrable highest weight representations of the affine lie algebra @xmath27 , where @xmath3 is the lie algebra of @xmath26 , while the quasiparticle fusion rules are given by the clebsch - gordon coefficients of the integrable representations of @xmath27.@xcite in contrast , when the gauge group is disconnected , and is of the form @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a discrete automorphism group of @xmath26 , it is much less straightfoward to compute the topological properties of the chern - simons theory directly .",
    "one reason for this is that discrete gauge theories are most easily studied ( and defined ) on a lattice , while it is difficult to formulate lattice versions of chern - simons theories .",
    "this complicates the study of chern - simons theories with disconnected gauge groups .    in the case where the gauge group is @xmath0 ,",
    "we show how to compute the ground state degeneracy on genus @xmath3 surfaces and how this yields the quantum dimensions of the quasiparticles .",
    "we find that the @xmath4 vortices carry non - abelian statistics and we show how to compute the degeneracy of states in the presence of @xmath6 pairs of @xmath4 vortices .",
    "the results , for a certain choice of coupling constants , agree exactly with results obtained in other ways for the @xmath9 parafermion fqh state .",
    "one interesting way of obtaining the pfaffian quantum hall states is by starting with a bilayer @xmath30 quantum hall state and taking the interlayer tunneling to infinity .",
    "the bilayer state is at a filling fraction @xmath31 and is described by the wave function @xmath32 , with @xmath33 here , @xmath34 is the complex coordinate of the @xmath35th electron in one layer and @xmath36 is the complex coordinate for the @xmath35th electron in the other layer .",
    "as the tunnelling is taken to infinity , we effectively end up with a single - layer state .",
    "the particles in the two layers become indistinguishable and so we might expect that the resulting wavefunction is the @xmath37 bilayer wavefunction but ( anti)-symmetrized between the @xmath38 and @xmath39 coordinates .",
    "the resulting wavefunction happens to be the pfaffian state : @xmath40 where @xmath41 refers to symmetrization or anti - symmetrization over @xmath42 and @xmath36 depending on whether the particles are bosons are fermions .",
    "here we have set @xmath43 .",
    "indeed , the @xmath44 bilayer states undergo a continuous quantum phase transition to the single - layer @xmath31 pfaffian states as the interlayer tunneling is increased.@xcite    in a similar fashion , the @xmath45 bilayer wave functions , when ( anti)-symmetrized over the coordinates of particles in the two layers , yield the @xmath9 parafermion states at filling fraction @xmath46.@xcite one way to verify this statement is through an operator algebra approach that also naturally suggests @xmath0 as the appropriate gauge group for the corresponding chern - simons theory ( see appendix [ projconstruction ] ) .",
    "this observation suggests that as the interlayer tunneling is increased , there may be a region of the phase diagram where there is a phase transition from the bilayer @xmath45 state to the single - layer non - abelian @xmath9 parafermion state . for @xmath47 ,",
    "this is a phase transition at @xmath12 , the phase diagram of which has attracted both theoretical and experimental attention .    given this perspective , we might expect that we can understand the low energy effective field theory of the pfaffian and @xmath9 parafermion states by gauging a discrete @xmath4 symmetry associated with the @xmath4 symmetry of interchanging the two layers .",
    "the effective field theories for the bilayer states are the @xmath21 chern - simons theories with the field strength of one @xmath13 gauge field describing the electron density for one layer and the field strength of the other gauge field for the other layer .",
    "this perspective suggests that the topological properties of these non - abelian states can be described by a @xmath8 chern - simons theory .",
    "this is a @xmath21 chern - simons theory with an additional local @xmath4 gauge symmetry .",
    "the semi - direct product @xmath48 here indicates that the @xmath4 acts on the group @xmath22 ; the @xmath4 group element does not commute with elements of @xmath21 . in other words ,",
    "elements of the group are @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and multiplication is defined by @xmath52 .",
    "this expectation for @xmath0 chern - simons theory turns out to be correct for the @xmath9 parafermion states but not quite correct for the pfaffian states , as we will discuss .",
    "we already have a field theory that correctly describes the topological properties of the bosonic @xmath15 pfaffian quantum hall state .",
    "this is the @xmath53 chern - simons theory described in or the @xmath54 chern - simons theory described in .",
    "( the pfaffian quantum hall state at other filling fractions are described by @xmath55 or @xmath56 chern - simons theory.@xcite ) similarly , the @xmath57 chern - simons theories described in encapsulate in some sense the topological properties of the @xmath14 parafermion states . a possible shortcoming of those theories , however , is that it can be unclear how to connect the degrees of freedom of the field theory to the physical degrees of freedom of the electron liquid .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath8 makes clearer the connection between the gauge fields and various physical degrees of freedom .",
    "it also makes clearer the relation to the bilayer state on the other side of the phase transition .",
    "given this closer contact to the physical degrees of freedom of the electron fluid and to the bilayer abelian phase , it is possible that this point of view may aid us in understanding physical properties of these quantum hall states , such as the quantum phase transition between two topologically ordered phases : the bilayer abelian phases and the non - abelian single - layer phases .",
    "the fact that such a chern - simons theory might describe the pfaffian and/or @xmath9 parafermion fqh states might also be expected from another point of view .",
    "it is known that the @xmath9 parafermion conformal field theory , which is used in constructing the @xmath9 parafermion fqh states , is dual to the rational @xmath4 orbifold at a certain radius.@xcite the rational @xmath4 orbifold at radius @xmath58 is the theory of a scalar boson @xmath59 compactified on a circle of radius @xmath58 , _",
    "i.e. @xmath60 , and that is gauged by a @xmath4 action : @xmath61 .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath4 orbifold at a different radius is dual to two copies of the ising cft , which is used to construct the pfaffian states .",
    "the chern - simons theory corresponding to the @xmath4 orbifold cft has gauge group @xmath62 , which we can think of as @xmath63.@xcite this line of thinking is what led the authors of to first mention that @xmath64 chern - simons theories are related to the pfaffian and @xmath9 parafermion states . in the @xmath9 parafermion case ,",
    "the relation to @xmath64 is suggestive but incomplete because the @xmath13 and the @xmath62 need to be `` glued '' together in an appropriate way ; we elaborate more on this point in appendix [ torusdiscussion ] .",
    "the proper formulation is the @xmath0 theory that we present here and for which we compute many topological properties . _",
    "let us first discuss the @xmath21 chern - simons theories that describe the @xmath65 bilayer states .",
    "these are defined by the lagrangian @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a two - dimensional manifold and @xmath68 and @xmath69 are two @xmath13 gauge fields defined on @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath67 describes space and @xmath71 describes time . the electron current / density in the top and bottom layers , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively ,",
    "are given by : @xmath74    in the @xmath0 chern - simons theory , we package the two gauge fields in the following way : @xmath75 the gauge group @xmath76 consists of the @xmath21 part , which we can write as @xmath77 and the @xmath4 part , which contains the identity and the non - trivial element @xmath78 : @xmath79 thus , in addition to the usual @xmath21 gauge symmetry associated with the two gauge fields , there is a local @xmath4 gauge symmetry , which can be thought of in the following way .",
    "the space of physical configurations at a certain space - time point @xmath80 is to be described by the unordered pair @xmath81 .",
    "the action of the @xmath4 is to interchange @xmath82 and @xmath83 at the point @xmath80 .",
    "physically , we may perhaps envision this as an electron from one layer and an electron from the other layer being interchanged . in order to define a sensible action",
    ", we need to be dealing with differentiable gauge fields .",
    "so , we require the gauge fields to be smooth functions on @xmath67 , thus automatically gauge - fixing the local @xmath4 and leaving behind a residual global @xmath4 symmetry associated with interchanging @xmath84 and @xmath85 at every point in space - time . in this sense",
    ", we can use the action given by eqn .",
    "@xmath86 to describe our @xmath8 chern - simons theory .",
    "although the @xmath22 chern - simons theory and @xmath87 chern - simons theory formally share the same lagrangian , their gauge structure is different .",
    "this is why the same lagrangian actually describes two different theories .",
    "this example demonstrates that the lagrangian is not a good symbol for a one - to - one labelling of different topological field theories .",
    "the first check that a field theory correctly describes a given topologically ordered phase is whether it correctly reproduces the ground state degeneracy of the system on surfaces of higher genus .",
    "accordingly , we begin our study of @xmath0 by calculating the ground state degeneracy on a torus . we then calculate the degeneracy on surfaces of arbitrary genus , from which we deduce the quantum dimensions of the quasiparticles .",
    "finally , we study the quasiparticles .",
    "gauge theory with gauge group @xmath26 on a manifold @xmath67 is most generally defined by starting with a principal @xmath26 bundle on @xmath67 and defining the gauge field , a lie algebra - valued one - form , as a connection on the bundle . often ,",
    "one is concerned with situations in which @xmath88 , in which case there is a global coordinate system and the gauge field can be written in coordinates everywhere as @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is a lie algebra - valued function on @xmath91 . in these cases , we do not need to be concerned with the more general fiber bundle definition in order to compute quantities of interest .",
    "the situation is more complicated in general , when @xmath67 does not have a global coordinate system , in which case we can only locally define @xmath92 in any given coordinate chart . in these situations , it is often convenient , when possible , to view the gauge field as a function defined on @xmath91 , where @xmath6 is the dimension of @xmath67 , and to impose suitable periodicity conditions",
    ". this allows us to work in a global coordinate system and may simplify certain computations .",
    "for example , for @xmath13 gauge theory on a torus , we can choose to work with a gauge field @xmath93 defined over @xmath94 , but with periodic boundary conditions : @xmath95 in the case where @xmath96 , the @xmath4 gauge symmetry allows for the possibility of twisted sectors : configurations in which the gauge field is periodic up to conjugacy by an element of @xmath4 . on a torus",
    ", there are four sectors and the ground state degeneracy is controlled by the degeneracy within each sector . in more mathematical terms , there are four distinct classes of @xmath2 bundles on a torus , distinguished by the four possible elements in the group @xmath97 , which is the group of homomorphisms from the fundamental group of @xmath98 to @xmath4 , mod @xmath4 .",
    "thus , we can think of @xmath99 as defined on @xmath100 , with the following periodicity conditions : @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 can each be @xmath104 ( untwisted ) or @xmath105 ( twisted ) .",
    "furthermore , in each of these sectors , the allowed gauge transformations @xmath106 take the form ( time index is suppressed ) @xmath107 and must preserve the boundary conditions on @xmath108 : @xmath109 these transform @xmath108 in the usual way : @xmath110    the formulation of the theory on higher genus surfaces is similar . on a genus @xmath3 surface ,",
    "there are @xmath111 different sectors , characterized by whether there is a @xmath4 twist along various non - contractible loops . across these twists , the two gauge fields @xmath84 and",
    "@xmath85 transform into each other .",
    "the gauge transformations also obey these same twisted boundary conditions ; this implies that the boundary conditions on the gauge fields are preserved under gauge transformations .",
    "the connection between this formulation and the definition of a principal @xmath26-bundle on a compact riemann surface can be made more precise by considering local coordinate charts , transition functions , _ etc , but here we do not pursue any further mathematical precision . _      as mentioned above , there are four sectors on a torus , one untwisted sector and three twisted sectors .",
    "we now proceed to compute the ground state degeneracy in each sector .",
    "we follow the approach in , which was applied to continuous and connected gauge groups .      in the untwisted sector , the ground states are the @xmath4 invariant states of a @xmath21 chern - simons theory with the lagrangian of eqn .",
    "( [ lagrangian ] ) .",
    "we partially fix the gauge by setting @xmath112 .",
    "the equations of motion for @xmath113 and @xmath114 , act as constraints that require zero field strength : @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "this implies that gauge - inequivalent configurations are completely specified by the holonomies of the gauge fields around non - contractible loops of the torus , @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "this is a special case of the more general statement that flat @xmath26-bundles are characterized by @xmath119 .",
    "we can parameterize this configuration space in the following way . @xmath120",
    "the large gauge transformations @xmath121 with @xmath122 take @xmath123 .",
    "thus @xmath124 and @xmath125 take values on a torus .",
    "substitution into the action yields , up to total time derivatives , @xmath126 the hamiltonian vanishes .",
    "the momenta conjugate to @xmath127 and @xmath128 are @xmath129 the wave functions for this system can be written as a sum of plane waves : @xmath130 in momentum space , the wavefunction becomes @xmath131 or , equivalently , @xmath132 using the fact that @xmath133 and @xmath134 , we find that @xmath135 there are @xmath136 independent coefficients @xmath137 , which explains why the @xmath65 quantum hall state has a degeneracy of @xmath136 on a torus .",
    "we can label the quantum states by @xmath138 .",
    "the ground states in our @xmath139 theory will be the @xmath4 invariant subspace of this hilbert space ; it will contain the diagonal states @xmath140 and ones of the form @xmath141 . a simple count of the @xmath4 invariant states , using the identifications ( [ id1 ] ) yields a total of @xmath142 states in this untwisted sector",
    ".      there are three @xmath4 twisted sectors , corresponding to twisting in either the @xmath143 direction , the @xmath144 direction , or both . since modular transformations , _",
    "i.e. diffeomorphisms that are not continuously connected to the identity , are symmetries that can take one twisted sector to another , we expect that all twisted sectors should have the same degeneracy .",
    "this can be verified explicitly by computing the degeneracy in each case . here",
    "we will only consider the case where the gauge fields are twisted in the @xmath144 direction .",
    "more precisely this means that the gauge fields obey the following boundary conditions : @xmath145 _    given these twisted boundary conditions , we can consider a new field @xmath146 defined on a space that is doubled in length in the @xmath144 direction : @xmath147 observe that @xmath148 has the periodicity @xmath149 the allowed gauge transformations that act on @xmath150 are of the form @xmath151 , where @xmath152 need only be periodic on the doubled torus : @xmath153 @xmath148 transforms as a typical @xmath13 gauge field : @xmath154 in particular , there are large gauge transformations @xmath155 that change the zero - mode of @xmath150 : @xmath156    in terms of @xmath148 , the lagrangian becomes @xmath157 note that this lagrangian is actually non - local in the field @xmath148 , but this does not pose any additional difficulty .",
    "we can set temporal gauge @xmath158 , _",
    "i.e. @xmath159 , and view the equation of motion for @xmath160 as a constraint that forces the field strength for @xmath148 to be zero .",
    "thus , the gauge - inequivalent configurations can be parameterized as @xmath161 where @xmath162 and @xmath163 .",
    "inserting this expansion into the lagrangian gives , up to total time derivatives , @xmath164 due to the existence of the large gauge transformations , we find that the zero - modes @xmath165 take values on a torus : @xmath166 thus , using the same techniques used in the previous section , we conclude that the ground state degeneracy in this sector is @xmath167 .",
    "there are three different twisted sectors , so we find in total @xmath168 states in the twisted sectors of the @xmath139 theory . _      adding the degeneracies from the twisted and the untwisted sectors , we find that the total ground state degeneracy on a torus in @xmath139 theory is @xmath169    for @xmath170 , the filling fraction is @xmath31 and the above formula gives @xmath171 states on a torus .",
    "compare this to the torus degeneracy of the @xmath31 pfaffian state , which is @xmath172 .",
    "we see that the @xmath0 chern - simons theory for @xmath170 has a torus ground state degeneracy that is three times that of the pfaffian state .",
    "so the @xmath173 chern - simons theory for @xmath170 can not directly describe the pfaffian state . in appendix [ torusdiscussion ] , we argue that , for @xmath170 , @xmath0 chern - simons theory describes the pfaffian state plus an extra copy of the ising model .    for @xmath7 ,",

    "but we need to project onto the @xmath4 invariant sector.the action of the @xmath4 is to take @xmath461 .",
    "we count @xmath462 @xmath4 invariant states when @xmath277 is odd . if @xmath463 , all of the @xmath460 states are @xmath4 invariant .",
    "how does this relate to the corresponding conformal field theory , which is the @xmath4 rational orbifold at level @xmath433 ?",
    "let us examine a few cases . when @xmath464 , this theory is the same as @xmath465 cft , which is abelian and which therefore should have degeneracy 1 for all @xmath6 .",
    "when @xmath463 , the orbifold cft is the same as two copies of the ising cft .",

    "the space of conformal blocks corresponding to @xmath467 @xmath466 fields on a sphere in the ising cft is @xmath430 , which agrees with our above analysis for @xmath463 .",
    "however , a theory with two copies of the ising cft would have many non - abelian fields : @xmath468 the space of conformal blocks corresponding to @xmath467 of either @xmath469 , @xmath470 , @xmath471 , or @xmath472 will have dimension @xmath430 .",
