    "therefore the peak - intensities of the different outbursts are intended to be illustrative of the times and types of outbursts .",
    "this will allow direct comparisons with the optical data and help us to understand the underlying be - neutron star interaction .",

    "we see that after the giant outbursts in 1975 ( the discovery ) , 1977 , 1980 , 1983 @xcite and 1989 , batse detected this source in 1994 @xcite .",
    "the 1994 giant outburst was preceded by three normal outbursts and followed by two small normal outbursts .",
    "then a0535 + 26 went back to quiescence for almost 11 years .",
    "only a few observations were reported during that period @xcite . the source renewed activity in 2005 may with another giant outburst and two normal outbursts .",
    "each of those normal outbursts began approximately a week before the periastron passage in the a0535 + 26@xmath13s 111 day orbit . unfortunately the 2005 giant outburst was poorly observed due to the closeness of the sun to the source .",
    "there are only a handful of _ rxte _ /asm dwells and serendipitous _",
    "swift_/bat observations near the outburst peak .",
    "in addition a pointed rhessi observation @xcite has been reported .",
    "after almost three years of being in quiescence a0535 + 26 was again active in 2008 undergoing four consecutive normal outbursts plus a giant outburst in 2009 december ( see figure  [ long_term_flux ] ) .",
    "the very large event occurred in 2009 december was foreseen due to the fact that new x  ray activity was detected 19 days before periastron .",
    "unexpectedly , another outburst peaking at @xmath01 crab ( in the 15 - 50kev band ) occurred , with intermediate low x ",
    "ray activity being detected .",
    "this event was followed by 2 weak normal outbursts . in 2011 february another giant outburst took place , approximately 11 days before the next periastron passage ( 2011 february 20 ) .",
    "the outbursts of higher fluxes began at an earlier orbital phase .",
    "it is to be noted that this is the shortest interval in which two ( or maybe three ? ) giant outbursts have been reported from a0535 + 26 .",
    "+      initial flaring of an outburst in 2005 september was seen as a double peak by _ rxte_. the highest flux in this outburst was reached during the short spike prior to periastron passage , and it was followed by a more gradual rise to a peak and then an exponential tail @xcite .",

    "more recently , a0535 + 26 underwent two double peaked normal outbursts in 2009 august and 2010 july ( see figure  [ 2xnormal ] ) .",
    "we point out that the one in 2009 august showed two approximately equal peaks in both duration and intensity ( see left panel of figure  [ 2xnormal ] ) without the typical shape of pre - periastron peaks described before . the last peculiar outburst in 2010",
    "july was only entirely measured by gbm .",
    "one could note that this outburst is also noticeable in the bat data , but these unfortunately have a gap up to the first peak ( mjd 55374 ) because of the sun ( on 2010 june 25 , the sun was @xmath08.5@xmath14 from a0535 + 26 ) .",
    "once more we found no resemblance with previous double - peaked outbursts .",
    "the first peak was smaller , shorter and totally detached from the main outburst peak ( see right panel of figure  [ 2xnormal ] ) . during the 2005 pre - outburst phase the pulse profile changed dramatically @xcite , as well as the value of the center of the cyclotron line energy @xcite .",

    "this allows us to study the spectral variability of a0535 + 26 without the supposition of any spectral model .",
    "gbm total flux lightcurves from 10 kev up to 80 kev ( 5kev and 10kev wide ) were obtained using the earth occultation technique .",
    "the hr was defined as 2040kev/1020kev and we used the flux in the 1080 kev band for the intensity in our diagram . to reduce large uncertainties",
    "the light curves were rebinned and then the hr were computed .",
    "it is to be noted that like all hardness ratios , these are instrumentally dependent . from that figure",
    "we can see that the vast majority of observations reveal a constant hardness ratio . only at low flux intensity levels",
    "there seems to be a smooth hardening of the spectrum of a0535 + 26as the flux intensity increases .",
    "therefore the diagonal and horizontal branches in the hri diagram observed by @xcite in a correlated spectral - timing analysis of four be / x - ray binaries , are not present for a0535 + 26 .",

    "we have shown how the h@xmath1 line is practically always in emission , except for a small period around mjd 51000 , telling us about the presence of a persistent but variable be - disk . in the long - term",
    ", the optical brightening of the be star , besides large negative values of the h@xmath1 ew , seems to precede the apparition of episodes of high x ",
    "ray luminosity ( and neutron star spin - up ) , including giant x  ray outbursts , indicating that the variations in the circumstellar structure are the precursors of this x  ray activity .",
    "this behavior has been observed in other bexrbs , as for instance in exo2030 + 375 @xcite .",
    "we have also observed that the onset of both normal and giant outbursts are initiated near periastron .",
    "although this does not fit the @xcite picture of type ii outbursts with timing unrelated to the underlying orbital period .    taking a closer look ,",
    "the be star lost and renewed its circumstellar disk during the period from @xmath01996 until 2005 .",
    "after this period the h@xmath1 ew and the optical brightening were no longer correlated .",
    "fig  [ zoom_2 ] shows that after @xmath0mjd 52500 ( 2002 august ) each giant x  ray outburst occurred during a decline phase of the optical brightness .",
    "it is interesting that the h@xmath1 showed a strong emission , while its optical brightness had a decreasing trend before and after the 2009 giant x  ray outburst .",
    "that is , the h@xmath1 ew and the v - band brightness showed an anti - correlation .",
    "@xcite propose that this anti - correlation may indicate that a mass ejection event took place before the 2009 giant x  ray outburst .",
    "the h@xmath1 ew measurements ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) implies this was the largest be - disk observed in the system since its discovery .",
    "this may explain the unusually active period of a0535 + 26 in x ",
    "rays . the decreasing trend and drastic optical spectroscopic variability after this 2009 december giant outburst has also been recently reported by @xcite . however , their measurements of the h@xmath15 ew before and during the 2009 giant outburst are much lower than our values and those from @xcite .",
    "most likely these differences are not real , but the product of two different instrument systems ( spectral resolution @xmath84 continuum determinations ) .     from @xmath02002 august up to 2011 march .",
    "we can see the anticorrelation of the h@xmath1 ew and the visual magnitude , with each giant x - ray outburst occurring during a decline phase of the optical brightness.[zoom_2],width=349,height=368 ]      it is interesting to compare ( fig  [ halfa_prof ] ) the h@xmath56 line profiles of the disks before , during , and after the giant outbursts in 2009 december ( left hand panel ) and 2011 february ( right hand panel ) , as observed by the frodospec spectrograph ( @xmath855000 ) on the liverpool telescope .",
    "this data presents a far higher time resolution ( @xmath0 few days ) than that typically obtained around the time of previous bursts ( @xmath01 month ) .    throughout the 2009 outburst the h@xmath56 profile was consistently single peaked with a slightly asymmetric profile characterized by a broader blue wing , and no significant change",
    "can be seen around the time of outburst . a comparison with the higher resolution ( @xmath86 ) but more infrequent spectra presented by @xcite , over the same time period , shows the same basic structure , although they are able to resolve the peak which shows a double peak with velocity separation of @xmath0100 km@xmath87 . on occasions",
    "small additional absorption and emission features are also seen in their spectra .",
    "we note that @xcite did not find any major changes in a series of jhk spectra taken during the x - ray quiescent phase and the giant x - ray outburst in 2011 february  march .    in late 2010",
    "( prior to the 2011 february outburst ) the disk can be seen to be in a very different state , with an h@xmath56 equivalent width of only half that seen in late 2009 and early 2010 .",
    "the profile is double peaked with a separation corresponding to @xmath0270 km@xmath87 .",
    "most striking are the rapid v / r ( violet / red ) variations in the strength of the two peaks .",
    "these have a period of @xmath025 days and can be seen to repeat over two cycle from late 2010 october until mid 2010 december .",
    "this is far shorter than the typical @xmath0 1000 day periods seen in isolated be stars @xcite .",
    "v / r variations with a timescale of @xmath01 year were noted from a0535 + 26 in the period following the giant outburst of 1994 feb / mar by @xcite ( from 1994 september until late 2006 ) , who attributed them to the presence of a global one - armed oscillation @xcite . from mid 2010 december",
    "the profile changes again , with the blue peak remaining dominant and the red wing broadening as a red component moves to higher velocities .",
    "no specific change at the time of the 2011 february outburst is obvious , with the red wing simply continuing its move to higher velocities .",
    "a general pattern of behavior may start to be inferred from the behavior of the system following the 1994 march and 2009 december giant outbursts , where the disk becomes weaker and shows @xmath88 variability commencing @xmath06 months following a giant outburst .",
    "following the model of @xcite ( which is consistent with the variability of the circumstellar disk after the 2009 giant x - ray outburst ) , it is important to note that those disk changes are not caused by the outburst , but rather that the outburst is a signal that changes in the disk are underway , presumably due to changes in the truncation resonance radius .",
    "if this pattern is to be believed , then when the source becomes observable again in 2011 september , we would expect the disk strength and associated line profile to differ from that presented in 2011 april . in this overall picture",
    "what is still an open question is the mechanism / s that trigger a giant outburst .",
    "a0535 + 26 exhibits an unpredictable x  ray behavior , with long periods of quiescence related to an absence of h@xmath1 in emission , with periodic normal outbursts generally taking place before and/or after a giant outburst .",
    "some peculiar normal outburts of a0535 + 26present a double peaked structure , with the origin of these pre - outburst peaks still unknown .",
    "our study of the spectral variability of this source using gbm data from recent outbursts shows that there is a hardening of the spectrum as the flux intensity increases .",
    "our pulse profile study for a0535 + 26 confirms in general previous results .",
    "however , for the brightest outburst monitored by gbm in 2009 december , we found that the two main components of the pulse profile evolved in opposite ways with energy , which to our knowledge has been never reported before .",
    "a hard 30 - 70 mhz x - ray qpo was detected with gbm during this giant outburst .",
    "the new insights are that it becomes stronger with increasing energy and disappears at energies below 25kev .",
    "current models can not explain these observations .    in spite of the fact that in the long - term a strong optical / x  ray correlation has been found for this bexrb , however it is still difficult to foresee when a giant outburst is going to take place and therefore what the trigger mechanism might be . on the other hand ,",
    "in the medium - term the h@xmath1 ew and the v - band brightness show an anti - correlation after @xmath02002 august ( mjd 52500 ) .",
    "each giant x - ray outburst occurred during a decline phase of the optical brightness , while the h@xmath1 showed a strong emission .",
    "we would like to point out that the large event that came after the 2009 december giant outburst does not follow the standard classification as either type - i or type - ii outburst .",
    "the be circumstellar disk was exceptionally large just before the 2009 december giant outburst .",
    "most likely this was the origin of the unusual recent x  ray activity of this source . in late 2010 and",
    "prior to the 2011 february outburst , rapid v / r variations are observed in the strength of the two peaks of the h@xmath1 line , with a period of @xmath025 days , suggesting the presence of a global one - armed oscillation .",
