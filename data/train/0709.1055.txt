    "the description of transport properties for states close to equilibrium in gaseous binary mixtures is well established . in these situations ,",
    "the curie principle @xcite states that the presence of a velocity gradient ( second - rank tensorial quantity ) can not modify a vectorial quantity such as the mass flux @xmath0 , which is generated by gradients of mole fraction @xmath1 , pressure @xmath2 , and temperature @xmath3 . as a consequence , the mutual diffusion coefficient @xmath4 ( which couples the mass current with @xmath5 ) , the pressure diffusion coefficient @xmath6 ( which couples the mass current with @xmath7 ) and the thermal diffusion coefficient @xmath8 ( which couples the mass current with @xmath9 ) do not depend on the velocity gradient .",
    "however , when the shear rate applied is large , non - newtonian effects are important so that the curie principle does not hold and the coefficients associated with the mass transport are affected by the presence of shear flow . in particular , if the spatial gradients @xmath5 , @xmath7 , and @xmath9 are weak , one expects that the flux @xmath0 is still linear in these gradients but the standard scalar coefficients @xmath10 must be replaced by the shear - rate dependent second - rank tensors @xmath11 . the aim of this paper is to determine the above tensors in the framework of the boltzmann equation .",
    "we are interested in a situation where _ weak _ spatial gradients of mole fraction , pressure , and temperature coexist with a _ strong _ shear rate . under these conditions ,",
    "the application of the conventional chapman - enskog expansion @xcite around the local equilibrium state to get higher order hydrodynamic effects ( burnett , super - burnett , @xmath12 ) to the mass flux turns out to be extremely difficult .",
    "this gives rise to look for alternative approaches .",
    "a possibility is to expand around a more relevant reference state than local equilibrium .",
    "since we want to compute the mass transport in a strongly sheared mixture , the so - called uniform shear flow ( usf ) state can be chosen as the reference state .",
    "the usf state is characterized by constant mole fractions , a uniform temperature , and a linear velocity profile @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the constant shear rate .",
    "due to its simplicity , this state has been widely used in the past to shed light on the complexities associated with the _ nonlinear _ response of the system to the action of strong shearing .",
    "in addition , the usf state is one of the rare exceptions for which the hierarchy of moments of the boltzmann equation admits an exact solution for single @xcite and multicomponent gases @xcite of maxwell molecules ( repulsive potential of the form @xmath15 ) . in this case ,",
    "explicit expressions of the pressure tensor ( which is the relevant irreversible flux of the problem ) have been obtained for _ arbitrary _ values of the shear rate and the parameters of the system ( masses , concentrations and force constants ) .",
    "as said before , here we want to compute the mass transport under usf for maxwell molecules . since the mixture is slightly perturbed from the usf , the boltzmann equation can be solved by an expansion in small gradients around the ( local ) shear flow distribution instead of the ( local ) equilibrium .",
    "this is the main feature of the expansion since the reference state is not restricted to small values of the shear rate . in the first order of the expansion ,",
    "the set of generalized transport coefficients @xmath11 are identified from the mass flux @xmath0 as nonlinear functions of the shear rate and the parameters of the mixture .",
    "this chapman - enskog - like expansion has been used to analyze transport properties in spatially inhomogeneous states near usf in the case of ordinary gases @xcite and more recently in the context of granular gases .",
    "@xcite    some previous attempts have been carried out earlier by the author and coworkers @xcite in the case of the diffusion tensor @xmath16 . however , all these studies have been restricted to perturbed _ steady _ states with the constraints @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "although steady states are in general desirable for practical purposes , especially in computer simulations , @xcite here we extend the above studies to a general time and space dependence of the hydrodynamic fields .",
    "this allows us to evaluate new contributions to the mass flux ( those proportional to @xmath7 and @xmath9 ) , which where not taken into account in the previous studies .",
    "@xcite    the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "first , a brief summary of the results obtained from the boltzmann equation for a binary mixture of maxwell molecules under usf is presented in sec .",
    "section [ sec3 ] deals with the perturbation scheme used to solve the boltzmann equation for the mixture to first order in the deviations of the hydrodynamic field gradients from their values in the reference shear flow state .",
    "the generalized transport coefficients characterizing the mass transport around usf are also defined in sec.[sec3 ] .",
    "these coefficients are explicitly obtained in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] with and without the presence of an external thermostat introduced usually in computer simulations to compensate for the viscous heating .",
    "the dependence of some of these coefficients on the shear rate is illustrated with detail in the tracer limit case , showing that the influence of shear flow on mass transport is quite significant .",

    "since @xmath39 and @xmath3 are uniform , then @xmath50 , and the transport of momentum ( measured by the pressure tensor ) is the relevant phenomenon . in the usf problem , the temperature tends to increase in time due to viscous heating .",

    "@xcite the simplest choice is a gaussian isokinetic thermostat given by @xmath51 where the thermostat parameter @xmath52 is a function of the shear rate adjusted as to keep the temperature constant .",
    "the implicit assumption behind the introduction of these forces is that they play a neutral role in the transport properties , so that the latter are the same with and without a thermostat , when conveniently scaled with the thermal speed . nevertheless , this expectation is not in general true , except for some specific situations and/or interaction potentials .",

    "as will be shown below , beyond the usf problem , the presence of the thermostat does not play a neutral role in the results and a certain influence may exist .",
    "as said in the introduction , the main aim of this work is to analyze mass transport of a dilute binary mixture subjected to usf . in that case , let us assume that the usf state is disturbed by small spatial perturbations .",
    "the response of the system to those perturbations gives rise to contributions to the mass flux that can be characterized by generalized transport coefficients .",

    "this anisotropy is more significant when the impurity is heavier than the particles of the gas .",
    "moreover , the shear field induces cross effects in the diffusion of particles .",

    ", @xmath225 is practically negligible .",
    "diffusion of particles in a binary mixture in non - newtonian regimes is a subject of great interest from a fundamental and practical points of view .",
    "if the mixture is strongly sheared , the mass flux @xmath0 can be significantly affected by the presence of shear flow so that the corresponding transport coefficients may differ significantly from their equilibrium values .",
    "in addition , the resulting mass transport is anisotropic and thus it can not be described by scalar transport coefficients but by shear - rate dependent tensorial quantities whose explicit determination has been the main objective of this paper .    in order to gain some insight into this complex problem ,",
    "a dilute binary mixture of maxwell molecules under usf has been considered .",
    "this is perhaps the only interaction potential for which the boltzmann equation can be exactly solved in some specific non - homogenous situations , such as in the case of the usf problem .",
    "in particular , the corresponding rheological properties of the mixture ( nonlinear shear viscosity and viscometric functions ) have been obtained for _ arbitrary _ values of the shear rate and without any restriction on the parameters of the mixture ( masses , concentrations , and force constants ) .",
    "@xcite this exact solution is of great significance in providing insight into the type of phenomena that can occur in conditions far away from equilibrium . in this paper , the interest has been focused on situations that slightly deviate from the usf by small spatial gradients . under these conditions , a generalized chapman - enskog method @xcite around the shear flow distribution has been used to determine mass transport in the first order of the deviations of the hydrodynamic field gradients from their values in the reference shear flow state @xmath231 . in this case , the mass flux @xmath232 is given by eq .",
    "( [ 3.25 ] ) , where the corresponding set of generalized transport coefficients @xmath233 are the solutions of the coupled algebraic equations ( [ 4.23])([4.25 ] ) in the unthermostatted case , while they are explicitly given by eqs.([4.30])([4.32 ] ) in the presence of a gaussian thermostat .",
    "@xcite this type of external forces are usually employed in nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to compensate exactly for the viscous increase of temperature .",
    "as expected , the results show that the coefficients @xmath233 present a complex dependence on the shear rate and on the masses , mole fractions , and force constants .",
    "this is clearly illustrated in figs .",
    "[ fig1][fig6 ] for the tracer limit case ( @xmath181 ) .",
    "the deviations of @xmath234 from their equilibrium values are basically due to three different reasons .",
    "first , the presence of shear flow modifies the collision frequency of the conventional diffusion problem ( @xmath235 ) by a shear - rate dependent term .",
    "second , given that the binary mixture is in general constituted by particles mechanically different , the reference shear flow states @xmath106 and @xmath116 are completely different .",
    "this effect gives rise to terms proportional to @xmath236 .",
    "third , in the unthermostatted case , the generalized coefficients are coupled due to the inherent non - newtonian features of the usf state .",
    "each one of the three effects is a different reflection of the extreme nonequilibrium conditions present in the mixture .",
    "it is apparent that the results presented here in the particular case of maxwell molecules may be relevant for interpreting computer simulation results .",
    "sarman , evans , and baranyai @xcite carried out time ago molecular dynamics simulations in a strongly sheared lennard - jones binary mixture to evaluate the self- and mutual - diffusion tensor by means of green - kubo formulae .",
    "@xcite to the best of my knowledge , this is the only computer experiment in which the shear - rate dependence of the diffusion tensor @xmath16 has been measured .",
    "they considered an equimolar lennard - jones mixture at two different densities and the parameters in the potential were adjusted to model an argon - krypton mixture , which means that the two components are fairly similar .",
    "as already said in ref .  , when one considers this type of mixture ( @xmath237 , @xmath238 , @xmath176 ) in the thermostatted case , the general qualitative dependence of the ( reduced ) mutual diffusion tensor @xmath239 on the ( reduced ) shear rate agrees quite well with computer simulations .",
    "thus , theory and simulation predict that in general , the @xmath240 element increases to a maximum and then it decreases again , while the @xmath209 element decreases with increasing shear rate . the off - diagonal elements @xmath219 and @xmath241 are negative and their magnitude increases with @xmath192 for not very large values of the shear rate .",
    "however , kinetic theory predicts that @xmath242 , while the opposite happens in computer simulations . on the other hand , at a quantitative level , the influence of shear flow on diffusion is much more modest in the molecular dynamics simulations than the one found theoretically for dilute gases .",
    "this is probably due to the fact that the shear rates ( in reduced units ) applied in the simulations are not large enough to observe significant changes of the diffusion tensor relative to its equilibrium value .",
    "an alternative to overcome the difficulties for reaching large shear rates in nonequilibrium molecular dynamics at low - density is the direct simulation monte carlo method .",
    "i hope that the results derived here for maxwell molecules for @xmath16 , @xmath145 and @xmath146 stimulate the performance of monte carlo simulations to assess the reliability of the maxwell results to describe mass transport in strongly sheared mixtures for more realistic interaction potentials .    as said before",
    ", it must noted that , in order to observe large effects of shear flow on the tensors @xmath243 , the ( reduced ) shear rate must be at least of the order of 1 .",
    "this means that for the inert gas fluids considered in this paper , non - newtonian effects on mass transport could be observable for shear rates practically unattainable in the laboratory . in this sense",
    ", one should look at fluids that are observed to be non - newtonian , such as colloidal suspensions , polymeric liquids , gels,@xmath244 .",
    "@xcite    although the results derived in this paper have been focused on the mass transport , the remaining transport coefficients associated with the pressure tensor @xmath245 and the heat flux vector @xmath246 could be determined from the integral equations ( [ 3.18])([3.21 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , in practice this calculation can not be carried out analytically by using the boltzmann equation since the fourth - degree moments of usf ( whose explicit expressions are not known in the boltzmann equation , except for a single gas@xcite ) are needed to get the heat flux . in order to overcome such a difficulty one can use a model kinetic equation that preserves the essential features of the true boltzmann equation but admits a more practical analysis .",
