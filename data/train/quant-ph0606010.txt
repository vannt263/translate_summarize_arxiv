    "phase matched  nonlinear ( nl ) crystal in which a pair of mutually orthogonally polarized photons is generated over two particular correlated @xmath12 modes @xcite .",
    "the overall quantum state emitted over these two modes is generally expressed by either bell state latexmath:[$%    other sources of @xmath6entangled pairs are based on spdc radiation generated by coherently pumping two thin type i crystals , orthogonally oriented and placed in mutual contact @xcite and by the interferometric parametric source , in which a single type i crystal is excited in two opposite directions ( @xmath5 , @xmath14 ) by a back - reflected pump beam @xcite . in both cases the spatial indistinguishability of the two parametric emission cones of the crystals , which are associated to the orthogonal polarizations , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , are responsible of the polarization entanglement corresponding to the bell states @xmath15 .",
    "several examples of two photon state manipulation , allowing the generation of either pure or mixed states , with variable degree of entanglement and mixedness , have been realized @xcite by these sources .",
    "more recently , their flexibility has been demonstrated in the generation of hyper - entangled photon pairs @xcite .",
    "a great deal of effort has been devoted towards development of sources of entangled photons operating under _ fsec _ laser pulse pumping .",
    "while this is generally done with type ii phase matching @xcite , only few examples of pulsed entangled state generation have been given for a double crystal system operating in the _ fsec _ regime @xcite .",
    "it is well known that in this case temporal walk - off may determine a strong degradation of @xmath6entanglement because of the distinguishability introduced on the photon path - ways by the effects of dispersion and birefringence in the nl crystal @xcite . in the present paper we report on the efficient generation of polarization entangled pairs , obtained when the interferometric single crystal scheme @xcite operates in this temporal regime .",
    "the effects of relevant walk - off affecting the entangled state generation in this particular case have been considered .",
    "moreover , we have performed a detailed investigation of the properties of entanglement and nonlocality of the parametric source and compared the experimental results with the theoretical predictions .",
    "let s briefly describe the parametric source shown in figure 1 .",
    "it is based on a _ single arm _",
    "interferometer whose active element is given by a single type - i , @xmath16 thick , @xmath17-barium - borate ( bbo ) crystal , cut at the phase matching angle @xmath18 .",
    "it is excited in two opposite directions , @xmath5 and @xmath14 , by a single transverse mode , vertically ( @xmath11 ) polarized , @xmath19 harmonic beam of a ti - sapphire ( coherent , mira @xmath20 ) @xmath21 laser ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the pump beam is slightly focused by a @xmath23 @xmath24 lens on the bbo . @xmath10",
    "polarized degenerate photon pairs are generated at @xmath25 @xmath26 over an emission cone with full aperture @xmath27 @xmath28{0xb0}}% % beginexpansion { { } ^\\circ}% % endexpansion $ ] .",
    "the interferometric scheme performs the simultaneous reflection by a common spherical mirror @xmath29 of either the pump beam or the parametric radiation .",
    "it includes also a @xmath30 quarter wave plate ( @xmath31qwp ) which plays a fundamental role in the generation of the entangled state by performing the @xmath32 transformation for the spdc radiation .",
    "this scheme is the same of that previously described in the case of cw pumping operation @xcite .",
    "after transmission through a @xmath33 lens ( @xmath34 ) the photons belonging to the emission cone are transmitted through a circular mask which identifies the so - called _ entanglement - ring _ ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "more than @xmath36 photon pairs corresponding to the @xmath6entangled state @xmath37 are detected for a pump power of @xmath38 , within the spectral bandwidth @xmath39 of the interference filters ( @xmath40 ) , which corresponds to a coherence - time of the emitted photons :  @xmath41 _ _  _ _ @xmath42 .",
    "it is worth noting that a very high phase stability of the state is guaranteed by the particular configuration of single arm interferometer adopted for the source .",
    "indeed , the triplet ( @xmath43 ) to singlet ( @xmath44 ) state transition is performed by a macroscopic displacement ( @xmath45 @xmath46 ) of mirror @xmath29 with respect the bbo crystal .    [ source ]     a significant test of the spatial and temporal superposition of the two cones , in absence of polarization entanglement ( i.e. with the @xmath31qwp oriented at @xmath47{0xb0}}% % beginexpansion { { } ^\\circ}% % endexpansion $ ] with respect its optical axis ) , is given by the measurement of the interference visibility performed by changing the phase @xmath48  and detecting an increasing fraction of the @xmath35 .",
    "this condition corresponds to the absence of any temporal or spatial walk - off between the photon pairs which can be generated with equal probability either in the first or in the second passage through the crystal .",
    "the single and the coincidence rates vary in this case proportionaly to @xmath49",
    ". we could measure @xmath50 over the entire @xmath35 , while a maximum of @xmath51 was obtained for an arc length of @xmath52 .",
    "the two birefringent ( b.r . ) elements , represented by the bbo crystal and the @xmath31qwp , may determine a relevant walk - off between the @xmath10 and @xmath11 polarization components when polarization entanglement is performed ( i.e. with @xmath31qwp oriented at @xmath53{0xb0}}% % beginexpansion { { } ^\\circ}% % endexpansion $ ] ) .",
    "in particular , when passing through a b.r",
    ". medium of length @xmath54 , the temporal walk - off occurring between the ordinary and extraordinary wavepackets , with group velocities @xmath55 and @xmath56 , is @xmath57 we need to consider this effect for each b.r .",
    "element present inside the parametric source ( in the present case the bbo and the @xmath31qwp ) and compare the resultant value of @xmath58 with the coherence - time @xmath41 .",
    "spatial walk - off arises from the different output angles at which the two waves go out of each b.r .",
    "this corresponds to a mutual spatial displacement @xmath59 of the two beams , given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 represents the mutual angle between the two waves .",
    "spatial walk - off becomes particularly severe when @xmath59 is of the order of the beam diameter .",
    "[ fig2 ]   and @xmath11 polarized photons in each section of the parametric source.,title=\"fig : \" ]    let s evaluate first the temporal walk - off effect . here",
    "we assume that any @xmath62 polarized photon pair generation event occurs in the center @xmath63 of bbo .",
    "moreover , either the pump pulse or the photon pair generated in the first passage passes two times with their own polarizations through the nl crystal and the zero - order @xmath31qwp .",
    "it is made by putting together two hortogonally oriented quartz crystals , with thickness @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "the total temporal walk - off effect can be evaluated by looking at the scheme of figure 2 which shows how the temporal delay occurring between the pump and the parametric photons varies in each portion of the whole path bbo-@xmath29-bbo .",
    "note that , because of the transmission through @xmath31qwp , spdc radiation and pump beam are respectively circularly and vertically polarized when travel through the section between @xmath29 and @xmath31qwp . in order to evaluate the total temporal walk - off , the following refractive indexes have to be considered @xcite : @xmath67 note the different sign of birefringence occurring in bbo and quartz",
    "after a round trip , i.e. at the exit of bbo , @xmath68polarized photons are delayed by @xmath69 with respect @xmath70polarized photons .",
    "this value determines a strong degradation of entanglement .",
    "concerning spatial walk - off , it is worth noting that , differently from the type ii crystal or the double crystal cases , because of the particular geometry of our source , in the present condition the @xmath71 and @xmath72 components travel in two parallel directions with a negligible spatial displacement @xmath73 when go outside the bbo crystal for the second time .",
    "the above considerations lead us to consider the relevant role of temporal walk - off and discard spatial walk - off in the generation of polarization entanglement .",
    "if temporal walk - off is not perfectly compensated the produced state can be expressed by the density matrix : @xmath74 with @xmath75 representing the weight of the entangled state contribution .",
    "temporal walk - off can be compensated by introducing an equal amount of temporal delay of @xmath72 with respect the @xmath76 component , restoring in this way the temporal indistinguishability . in the next section",
    "we ll examine in detail some experimental results concerning this point .",
    "temporal walk - of can be compensated by a suitable quartz plate with the optical axis oriented in the @xmath10 direction in order to to recover temporal indistinguishability of the @xmath76 and @xmath77 components .",
    "basing on the values of the ordinary and extraordinary refractive indexes of ( [ index ] ) , @xmath78 of quartz are necessary on this pourpose .",
    "the plate @xmath79 , shown in figure 1 , intercepting the entire @xmath35 , was aligned at the output of the source with the optic axis oriented along the @xmath10 direction .",
    "we tested the polarization entanglement of the state @xmath80 by using the two polarization analyzers ( @xmath81 ) shown in figure 1 before the single photon detector modules ( @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) .",

    "the measured visibility of the coincidence rate , @xmath11 @xmath85 , gives a strong indication of the entangled nature of the state over an arc length of @xmath86 , while the single count rates do nt show any periodic fringe behaviour , as expected .",
