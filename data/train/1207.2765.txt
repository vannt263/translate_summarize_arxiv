    "accurately treating convective heat transport in stellar models is difficult .",
    "the structure and evolution of most stars is related to convective transport processes in their outer layers .",
    "the transition from efficient convective transport in the deep envelope to the radiative atmospheric layers takes place in a region of inefficient convection where the temperature gradient is highly superadiabatic .",
    "the poorly known structure of this region remains one of the major uncertainties in stellar models . in one - dimensional calculations , this region",
    "is usually modeled using the `` mixing length theory , '' or mlt @xcite .",
    "this prescription assumes that one can approximate the full range of turbulent eddy - sizes by a typical size , and that an eddy on average travels a distance determined by the eddy size before losing its identity .",
    "this distance , is known as the `` mixing length '' and is usually defined as @xmath1 , where @xmath0 is known as the `` mixing - length parameter , '' and @xmath2 is the local pressure scale height .",
    "given the atmospheric structure , the approximation , when given the mixing length , fix the specific entropy in the deep convection zone , which in turn determines the radius of the model .",
    "the model radius thus depends sensitively on the choice of the mixing - length parameter @xmath0 , which is a free parameter that can not be determined from the mixing length theory .    the common practice when modeling stars to determine their structure and evolution is to use the solar value of @xmath0 .",
    "we know the mass , radius , luminosity and age of the sun precisely .",
    "solar models are constructed by searching for @xmath0 and the initial helium abundance @xmath3 that yield a model with the correct radius and luminosity at the sun s age . since masses , radii and ages",
    "are usually unknown for other stars , the solar approach is unfeasible and , hence , the solar value of @xmath0 is used .",
    "the assumption of a fixed @xmath0 has no _ a priori _ justification , and indeed , there is some evidence that the solar value of @xmath0 does not always work for other stars . @xcite",
    "first noted that the radius of @xmath0  cen  a can not be reproduced using the solar value of @xmath0 .",
    "a combined astrometric and seismic study of the @xmath0  cen system by @xcite confirmed this result as have more recent studies ( e.g. , fernandes & neuforge 1995 ; miglio & montalban 2005 ) .",
    "some studies of other binary systems have also suggested a mass - dependence of @xmath0 ( e.g. , ludwig & salaris 1999 ; morel et al .",
    "2000 ; lebreton et al .",
    "2001 ; lastennet et al .",
    "2003 , etc . ) .",
    "in particular , yildiz et al .",
    "( 2006 ) studied binaries in the hyades cluster and suggested that @xmath0 increases with stellar mass .",
    "numerical simulations of stellar convection also suggest that convective properties vary with stellar parameters ( e.g. , ludwig et al .",
    "1999 ; trampedach 2007 ; trampedach & stein 2011 ) .",
    "while studies of binaries and clusters have suggested that the solar @xmath0 is not always applicable , the situation for single field stars is not clear because of the lack of observational constraints .",
    "asteroseismic data from space missions like corot ( michel et al .",
    "2008 ) and _ kepler _ ( borucki et al . 2010 ) allow us to place independent constraints on the mass and radius of single stars . these constraints , along with the classical constraints of @xmath4 and metallicity , allow us to constrain @xmath0 .",
    "we already know that the oscillation spectra of some corot and _ kepler _ stars can not be reproduced using the solar value of @xmath0 ( e.g. , metcalfe et al . 2010 ; deheuvels & michel 2011 , mathur et al .",
    "detailed asteroseismic modeling of the solar analogs 16 cyg a & b has also required the adoption of non - solar values of @xmath0 ( metcalfe et al .",
    "in this study we use asteroseismic data obtained by nasa s _ kepler _ mission to calibrate @xmath0 for a sample of dwarfs and subgiants .",
    "observational data and our analysis technique are described in   [ sec : methods ] .",
    "we present our results and discuss their implications in   [ sec : results ] .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath0 is just a proxy for describing stellar convection , and in particular @xmath0 describes the entropy change between the surface and the deeper , isentropic , layers of efficient convection . as a result",
    ", the value of @xmath0 can not be derived uniquely .",
    "it depends on the exact formulation of the mixing - length theory ( see , e.g. , appendix a of ludwig et al .",
    "1999 ) , as well as physics inputs that affect entropy e.g. , atmospheric opacities , the temperature - optical depth relation ( @xmath5-@xmath6 ) in the atmosphere , the equation of state and processes such as the gravitational settling of helium and heavy elements .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath0 in a given star needs to be examined in the context of the value of @xmath0 needed to construct a solar model with the same physics .",
    "note that conventional mlt assumes a fixed ratio between the distance traveled by an eddy and its size , and @xmath0 is the only free parameter .",
    "some approximations ( see e.g. , arnett et al . 2010 ) leave the ratio as an adjustable parameter .",
    "we use the conventional bhm - virtense form of mlt and only adjust @xmath0 .",
    "we used data obtained by the _ kepler _ asteroseismology program ( gilliland et al .",
    "2010 ) during its survey phase .",
    "the survey collected data on more than 2000 main - sequence and sub - giant stars and stellar oscillations were detected in about 500 ( chaplin et al .",
    "2011 ) . of these we used a subset of 90 stars for which spectroscopic estimates of effective temperature @xmath4 and metallicity [ m / h ] are available from bruntt et al .",
    "( 2012 ) .",
    "we used the average large separation @xmath7 and the frequency of maximum oscillation power @xmath8 for this work .",
    "the large separation scales approximately as the square root of the mean density of a star ( ulrich 1986 ; christensen - dalsgaard 1988 ) while the frequency of maximum power scales approximately as @xmath9 ( brown et al .",
    "1991 ; kjeldsen & bedding 1995 ; bedding & kjeldsen 2003 )",
    ". the @xmath7 and @xmath8 values are those used by verner et al .",
    "( 2011 ) to verify the _ kepler _ input catalog ( brown et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "first , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath4 and [ m / h ] are used to estimate the mass and radius of each star . for this",
    "we used the grid - based yale - birmingham ( yb ) pipeline described by basu et al .",
    "( 2010 ) gai et al .",
    "( 2011 ) and basu et al .",
    "we use four stellar - model grids for our work : models from the yonsei - yale ( yy ) isochrones ( demarque et al .",
    "2004 ) , and those of dotter et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , marigo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and gai et al .",
    "the grids have been constructed with different physics inputs and modeling parameters , and with solar @xmath0 consistent with the inputs to the grids . for subsequent calculations",
    "the average of the mass and radius estimates returned by the four grids is used .",
    "the properties of our final sample are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : props ] .",
    "note that our sample is quite restricted in terms of @xmath10 and we lack stars that are close to the base of the red giant branch ; in fact we have very few stars with @xmath11 .",
    "this will make finding a @xmath10 dependence of the derived @xmath0 difficult .",
    "there is the expected correlation between mass and @xmath4  the higher temperature stars are generally more massive .",
    "although each mass range spans a range of @xmath10 , unsurprisingly the least evolved stars in our sample are also the least massive .",
    "most stars in our sample have sub - solar metallicities .",
    "starting with mass , radius , @xmath4 and metallicity , each star in our sample was modeled using the yale stellar evolution code ( yrec ; demarque et al .",
    "2008 ) in an iterative manner .",
    "in this mode , radius and @xmath4 were specified and the code determined either @xmath0 or the initial helium abundance ( @xmath3 ) that yielded the specified radius at the given @xmath4 for a given mass . in the former case",
    "@xmath3 has to be specified , in the latter @xmath0 has to be specified .    the input physics consisted of the opal equation of state ( rogers & nayfonov 2002 ) , opal high - temperature opacities ( iglesias & rogers 1996 ) supplemented with ferguson et al .",
    "( 2005 ) low temperature opacities .",
    "nuclear reaction rates were from adelberger et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , except for the @xmath12 reaction , which was fixed at the value of formicola et al .",
    "models did not include core overshoot or the diffusion and settling of helium and heavy elements .",
    "we used the eddington @xmath13 relation in the atmosphere . with the above physics",
    ", the solar - calibrated value of @xmath0 is @xmath14 . including gravitational settling of helium and metals",
    "would change that to @xmath15 .",
    "for the first set of calculations we assumed solar @xmath0 for all stars and determined @xmath3 that would be needed to model the stars .",
    "we then performed two other sets of calculations : ( 1 ) we estimated @xmath0 assuming that all stars have the solar value of @xmath16 ( serenelli & basu 2010 ) ; ( 2 ) we estimated @xmath0 assuming that @xmath3 follows a simple chemical evolution model , @xmath17 ( dotter et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the iterative modeling process was repeated for 200 monte carlo realizations of @xmath18 and [ m / h ] to estimate the uncertainties in @xmath3 ( or @xmath0 ) .",
    "parameters in each realization were randomly chosen from a gaussian distribution centered on the measured central value , with the dispersion equal to the mean measurement error . to avoid uncertainties due to small number statistics , we show results of stars with at least 20 converged iterations .",
    "this requirement resulted in a final sample of about 55 stars .",
    "the median of the distribution of parameter values is quoted as the central value of the parameter , and uncertainties are determined as the 68% confidence limit of the distribution .",
    "the reliability of the derived @xmath0 estimates depends on the reliability of the observations and those of the mass and radius estimates .",
    "there are indications that grid - based mass estimates can have systematic errors caused by differences in the input physics of the grids ; however , these are smaller than those caused by uncertainties in @xmath4 , [ m / h ] , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( basu et al . 2012 ) .",
    "mathur et al . (",
    "2012 ) have shown that grid - based estimates of stellar masses and radii agree very well with those obtained from more detailed modeling of the oscillation frequencies , giving us confidence in the robustness of our mass and radius estimates . while detailed modeling of the oscillation spectrum is preferable for all stars , this is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the initial helium abundance , @xmath3 , needed to construct models of the stars in our sample  assuming that they all have the solar value of @xmath0  is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : yt ] .",
    "note that for @xmath19% of our sample the @xmath3 estimate is less than the primordial value of @xmath20 ( peimbert et al .",
    "while the deficit is within @xmath21 for some stars , there are stars with a @xmath22 deficit .",
    "the weighted average of @xmath3 of the sample is @xmath23 .",
    "the weighted median is @xmath24 , both below @xmath25 .",
    "it is , of course , highly unlikely that stars are born with less helium than was produced in the big bang .",
    "given that the only parameter we could change in mlt is @xmath0 , this implies that solar @xmath0 does not properly approximate convective heat transport in these stars .",
    "note that a change of physics inputs to the models will change the solar value of @xmath0 , and the exercise repeated with the new solar @xmath0 would give similar results .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : at](a ) we show the value of @xmath0 for our sample obtained assuming either the solar value of @xmath3 ( red points ) , or the simple chemical evolution model of @xmath3 ( black points ) .",
    "note that @xmath0 for most of the stars is less than the solar value for both cases the average value of @xmath0 for this sample is @xmath26 for solar @xmath3 and @xmath27 when the chemical - evolution model is used . in mlt , lower @xmath0 implies less efficient convection .",
    "thus mlt predicts that in the superadiabatic layers , convective energy transport in our sample is generally less efficient than that in the sun . since the results with the two choices of @xmath3 are similar , in the subsequent discussions we only use @xmath0 obtained with the chemical evolution model of @xmath3 .",
    "mathur et al . ( 2012 ) constructed detailed models to fit the mode frequencies of 22 _ kepler _ stars using the asteroseismic modeling portal ( amp ; metcalfe et al .",
    "2009 ) there are 16 stars in common with our sample . in fig .",
    "[ fig : at](b ) we show the differences between the mathur et al .",
    "@xmath0 values and the ones obtained in this work .",
    "the two @xmath0 estimates agree well , mostly within @xmath21 .",
    "since the physics in the amp models is different from ours , they obtain a solar @xmath0 of 2.12 .",
    "thus to compare their results with ours , we have scaled the amp results to our value of the solar @xmath0 . in fig  [ fig : at](c ) and ( d ) we show the variation of @xmath0 with @xmath10 and [ m / h ] .     in order to explore whether our @xmath0 estimates are correlated with stellar properties , we first determined the simple spearman rank correlation between @xmath0 and different properties .",
    "the correlation coefficients are listed in table  1 .",
    "also listed is the @xmath28-value , which is the probability that the correlation is a chance occurrence .",
    "a small @xmath28 therefore indicates a significant correlation .",
    "there thus appears to be significant correlation between metallicity and @xmath0 .",
    "there also seems to be a mildly significant correlation between mass and @xmath0 .",
    "the significance of the correlation of @xmath0 with @xmath10 or @xmath4 depends on whether or not we include the low-@xmath10 stars in our analysis .",
    "table  1 lists the coefficient obtained for the entire sample , as well as that obtained by removing the lowest @xmath10 stars ( @xmath29 ) in our sample .",
    "since @xmath0 depends simultaneously on a number of parameters , to get a better estimate of the correlations we perform a trilinear fit to @xmath0 with the model @xmath30}. \\label{eq : mod}\\ ] ] table  1 lists the coefficients and @xmath28-values , and fig .  [",
    "fig : avar ] shows the residuals , and partial residuals , of the fit to eq .",
    "[ eq : mod ] .",
    "note that the metallicity dependence is robust .",
    "the @xmath10 and @xmath4 correlations are small and less statistically significant when the entire sample is used ; these increase in significance , but change signs , when the @xmath10 cut is applied .",
    "the mass correlation seen in the spearman correlation is most likely to be the result of the mass-@xmath4 and mass-@xmath10 correlation seen in fig .  1 as indicated by the fact that the residuals of the fit to eq .",
    "[ eq : mod ] do not show any trend with mass ( fig .",
    "[ fig : avar](a ) and ( e ) ) .",
    "the metallicity dependence of @xmath0 is relatively easy to understand .",
    "it is most likely caused by the temperature sensitivity of the h@xmath31 density and hence , of its dominant contribution to the optical continuum opacity .",
    "e.g. , in the solar photosphere , @xmath32% of the electrons that form h@xmath31 are donated by metals , and the fraction increases steeply with height due to low - ionization potential elements like na , al , k , ca and cr . with a smaller amount of metals , the temperature sensitivity of the h@xmath31 density will therefore increase . this in turn will increase the contrast between up- and down - flows , and especially increase the range of depths over which the down - flows will be cooled .",
    "this results in a larger entropy jump between the surface and the deeper layers , meaning a lower convective efficiency ( a smaller @xmath0 in the context of mlt ) .",
    "since the average metallicity of our sample is sub - solar , we believe that this metallicity dependence accounts for the lower - than - solar average value of @xmath0 for our sample .",
    "the lack of a significant correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath4 or @xmath10 is surprising .",
    "this is most likely the result of the limited and skewed range of @xmath10 of our sample , and is confirmed by the change of the sign of the correlation when the @xmath10 cutoff is applied .",
    "a larger sample should resolve these issues , in particular , data on giants should help determine the @xmath10 dependence properly .",
    "piau et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , using a sample of red giants with radii known from interferometry , have shown that the red - giant models require sub - solar values of @xmath0 to explain the observations ; however , they did not address the dependence of @xmath0 on stellar parameters .    as noted earlier",
    ", @xmath0 is just a proxy for describing convection in stars .",
    "although it is known that using such a proxy does not reproduce properties of the stellar near - surface layers correctly , mlt remains a practical tool in stellar modeling .",
    "an @xmath0 type parameter can also be derived from numerical simulations of stellar convection ( e.g. , ludwig et al .",
    "1999 ; trampedach et al .",
    "1999 ; trampedach 2007 ) . at present",
    "it is difficult to compare these results with ours since the simulations were for solar composition , and the metallicity dependence of our results is fairly strong .",
    "however , there do seem to be some differences between our findings and the simulations . at a given @xmath10 , ludwig et al .",
    "( 1999 ) found @xmath0 to decrease with increasing @xmath4 for dwarfs in their 2d simulations and they find @xmath0 to decrease with @xmath10 .",
    "a similar behavior was seen in the 3d simulations of trampedach ( 2007 ) .",
    "our @xmath0-@xmath4 correlation agrees with theirs , but the @xmath10 one does not when we examine the entire sample ; when we apply the @xmath10 cutoff the reverse becomes true , the @xmath10 correlation agrees , the @xmath4 correlation does not .    as more detailed asteroseismic data become available from _ kepler _ , and they are modeled , we will be able to reduce the uncertainties in the mixing - length parameters needed to model the stars , and the dependence of the properties of near - surface convection , including the corresponding value of @xmath0 , on stellar parameters will become clearer . as it is ,",
    "our results have important implications for the different branches of astrophysics that depend on fitting stellar models .",
    "the usual way to determine stellar properties is through spectroscopic or photometric analyses of the star combined with fitting to grids of stellar models to obtain masses and radii ( e.g. , takeda et al .",
    "2007 ) or ages ( e.g. , jrgensen & lindegren 2005 ) . at a given metallicity ,",
    "a lower @xmath0 makes the evolutionary track of a given mass redder than its higher-@xmath0 counterpart , and thus the properties of a star obtained using models constructed with a solar @xmath0 will be quite different from those obtained with a sub - solar @xmath0 .",
    "although the @xmath4 change with @xmath0 is really a result of a radius change , it appears as a change in the estimated mass of star being fitted ( basu et al .",
    "consequently , we would be underestimating the mass of a sub - solar metallicity star if we use models constructed with the solar value of @xmath0 .",
    "stellar population and spectral synthesis models also use a single ( usually the solar calibrated ) value of @xmath0 ( see e.g. coelho et al . 2007 ) , and our results now show that the uncertainties in @xmath0 need to be added to the error budget of results that use those models .",
