    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are powered by gas accreting onto the central super - massive black hole . as such their intrinsic spectra",
    "are determined simply by the mass and spin of the black hole , together with the mass accretion rate , although their observational appearance is also affected by absorption .",
    "the discovery that the black hole mass scales with the host galaxy bulge properties ( @xcite ; @xcite ) presented a means to classify the bewildering variety of unabsorbed agn spectra in terms of two of these three intrinsic properties .",
    "it was found that different optical spectral types clearly correlated with black hole mass and mass accretion rate , with the narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s : defined as @xmath2 emission line fwhms less than 2000 km / s and @xmath3/h\\beta$ ] flux ratios less than 3.0 @xcite ) as examples of lower mass black holes accreting at higher eddington ratio than the typical broad line seyfert 1s ( bls1s ) , which in turn had higher eddington ratio / lower black hole masses than the linerss ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "nls1 s are intrinsically very luminous in the euv / soft x - ray bandpass , comprising over half the agn found in the soft x - ray selected _ rosat _ all sky survey ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this strong ionising flux results in intense permitted optical fe ii emission lines from the broad line region and high ionisation species often refered to as coronal lines ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "other observed characteristics include rapid x - ray variability ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and steeper soft x - ray spectra than those of bls1s ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . taken together these distinctive properties have led to them being considered as the scaled up counterparts of the most luminous accretion states seen in stellar mass black hole binary ( bhb ) systems ie .",
    "those having `` high '' and `` very high '' states ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this link with the stellar mass black hole systems was strengthened by the discovery of an x - ray qpo in the nls1 re j1034 + 396 ( @xcite ) .",
    "such qpos are commonly strongest in the bhb observed in their very high state ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "clearly it is important to understand whether qpos are common amongst nls1 , or whether re j1034 + 396 is unique in some other way .",
    "we first summarise the properties of re  j1034 + 396 , in order to provide the context for our study of rx j0136.9 - 3510 , which is reported in this paper .",
    "the uniqueness of re  j1034 + 396 is suggested by its broad band spectral energy distribution ( sed ) which is extreme even amongst nls1 .",
    "it exhibits a peak in the far uv which connects smoothly onto the steep soft x - ray spectrum .",
    "these components form a huge `` soft x - ray excess '' with respect to the @xmath4 x - ray tail which dominates above @xmath5  kev ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the energy dependence of this variability is also very different to that commonly seen in other agn .",
    "the fractional variability amplitude ( as measured by root mean square , hereafter _",
    "rms _ ) rises steeply to @xmath6  kev and then levels off .",
    "this is most likely due to the presence of two separate components in the x - ray spectrum , with the variability being associated with the x - ray tail , whilst the soft excess component remains more or less constant ( @xcite ) .",
    "this situation contrasts with the flat or falling _ rms _ spectra seen in other agn , sometimes with a peak at @xmath6  kev superimposed on this ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which makes it more likely that the apparent soft excess in these objects is due instead to a single spectral component distorted by reflection and/or absorption ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we make use of the unusual energy dependence of the x - ray variability in re j1034 + 396 to search for potentially similar objects .",
    "a survey of all long ( @xmath7  ks ) xmm - newton observations of bright and variable agn yielded a similar _ rms _ shape only in one object rx j0136.9 - 3510 ( 2massi j0136544 - 350952 ) .",
    "this agn also has a similar broadband spectrum to re  j1034 + 396 , suggesting that they may form a subclass of the highest mass accretion rate agn .",
    "we searched the _ xmm - newton master log _ & _ public archive _ for pointed observations with exposure times in the pn instrument of @xmath8 s in `` subject_category ''  agn , qsos , bl - lacs and xrb  .",
    "this resulted in 115 observations .",
    "we further refined this criteria to include only those objects with pn count rates of @xmath9 counts / s , to include only bright sources for which the variability can be well determined .",
    "we also included ngc  4051 as this is a well known , bright , nls1 with an exposure of 49917 s ( 0157560101 ) . since this is not a statistical study its inclusion does not affect our general conclusions .",
    "we also searched the _ xmm - newton serendipitous source catalogue ( 2xmmi version ) _ for serendipious bright agn detected in similarly long exposures , by setting pn@xmath108@xmath10flux @xmath11 erg @xmath12 s@xmath13 and pn@xmath10ontime@xmath1450000 s. this yielded 29 observations .",
    "we then combined these two samples , and included only the longest exposure dataset or the best observation quality dataset for multiply observed objects .",
    "this gave a total of 68 individual sources .",
    "for each source we calculated the fractional variability amplitude using lcstats in xronos 5.21 .",
    "this is defined as the root mean square of the intrinsic ( corrected for error bars ) variance about the lightcurve mean , normalised to this mean .",
    "only sources which are strongly and significantly variable can provide constraints on the energy dependence of the variability .",
    "so we select only sources for which the _ rms _ is @xmath15 and where the uncertainty on this _ rms _ is @xmath16 , to ensure that the variability is significantly detected .",
    "this filtering leaves 15 sources .    for each of these sources we calculated the fractional variaibility amplitude as a function of energy using the method of @xcite .",
    "this showed the standard range of _ rms _ spectral shapes .",
    "only rx j0136.9 - 3510 ( 0303340101 ) displayed the very different type of _ rms _ spectrum associated with the qpo agn , re j1034 + 396 , in which the fractional amplitude rises as a function of energy , then remains high . having identified this unusual agn , we investigate its properties in more detail below .",
    "the lightcurve and _ rms _ spectrum are extracted from the x - ray data ( 0.3 - 10 kev ) , using sas7.1.0 and xronos5.21 .",
    "we use regions with radius of 16 , 9.2 and 8.6 for pn , mos1 and mos2 , respectively .",
    "no significant pile - up is seen from the sas command epatplot so no central region was excluded .",
    "there are high background flares during the first 10000 s , so we exclude these data , resulting in @xmath040000 s ( with background count rate@xmath17 counts / s ) for the _ rms _ spectrum generation .",
    "figure  [ lightcurve ] shows the resultant total lightcurve ( pn , mos1 and mos2 ) , binned on 200  s. the source shows strong variability ( also seen by ghosh et al .",
    "2009 , in preparation ) , with the _ rms _ fractional variation being 0.13 . however , there is no obvious qpo .",
    "we rebin the lightcurve on 2000  s in order to provide enough count statistics to calculate the fractional variability as a function of energy . fig .",
    "[ rms - spectrum ] shows that this _ rms _ rises steeply from 0.3 kev to @xmath02 kev , then flattens off .",
    "the weak decrease from 2 - 10 kev is not significant as the low count rate means their are large uncertainties on the last point .",
    "we also calculated the _",
    "rms _ spectra from 200 s binning , but this is not significantly different .    , the binning time is 2000s.,width=317 ]",
    "the optical spectrum has an @xmath18 flux ratio of @xmath19(@xcite ) , compared to the @xmath20 average for nls1s ( @xcite ) , making rx j0146.9 - 3510 an unusual nls1 @xcite.we use the optical spectrum shown in fig  [ optical - sed ] ( d. grupe , private communication ) to estimate the black hole mass .",
    "the h@xmath21 line width is used as a proxy for this ( @xcite ; @xcite ) from @xmath22^{0.7}{fwhm}^{2}\\ ] ] comparing this method for a sample of agn with reverberation mapping , the rms difference is about 0.5 dex ( @xcite ) . the flux at @xmath23 from the optical spectrum is @xmath24erg @xmath12s@xmath13 .",
    "the luminosity distance is @xmath25  mpc for @xmath26 assuming @xmath27 km mpc@xmath13 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .    estimating the fwhm of the line is not straightforward as the h@xmath21 line profile is complex .",
    "there is clearly also a component from the extended narrow line region ( nlr )",
    ". this should be similar to the profile of the [ oiii ] emission line .",
    "so @xcite use a template constructed from the [ oiii]@xmath305007 line to represent the narrow component , together with a broader gaussian component , with fwhm=1320 km / s , to reconstruct the @xmath2 line .",
    "this gives a black hole mass estimate of @xmath31 .",
    "however , the optical spectrum plainly has limited signal - to - noise , and the [ oiii ] 5007 line is probably contaminated by feii emission as it should be in 3:1 ratio with the ( unobserved ) [ oiii ] line at 4959 .",
    "hence we perform our own best fit of the h@xmath21 line profile with a gaussian of width 870 km / s for the narrow line component , see figure  [ optical - sed ] .",
    "this gives a fwhm for the broad component of 3200@xmath322600 km s@xmath13 , with a ( not significant ) blueshift of -370@xmath321100 km s@xmath13 .",
    "using our new value for the fwhm , the resultant black hole mass is @xmath33 .",
    "even with this lower black hole mass , this agn is still probably @xmath34 more massive than the qpo agn , re j1034 + 396 , ( with the previous mass estimate being @xmath35 larger ) .",
    "thus any similar qpo in rx j0136.9 - 3510 would be on timescales 10 - 50@xmath36 larger , requiring a much longer x - ray observation in order to detect it .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we use the standard products to obtain the xmm - newton x - ray ( pn ) and optical / uv ( om ) spectra .",
    "we then combine these with selected continuum points from the ( non simultaneous ) optical spectum ( d. grupe , private communication ) using flx2xsp to incorporate these into the same format as the xmm - newton data .",
    "we likewise include the j , h and k near infrared flux points from 2mass , and perform all spectral fitting using xspec11.3.2 .",
    "we follow the approach of @xcite in modelling the broadband sed , using diskpn to model an accretion disc extending down to the last stable orbit around a non - spinning black hole",
    ". however , our source is at @xmath26 so we modify the diskpn code to incorporate the redshift dependance . and also we use the higher estimated black hole mass in section  [ section - mass ] to calculate the normalization of the diskpn and fix it at 2910 during the spectral fitting .",
    "compton scattering of these disc photons can be approximated by a broken power law ( bknpower ) , with index of @xmath37 below a break at @xmath38 .",
    "we then added a low temperature comptonisation component to model the soft excess , using comptt , with seed photons set to the disc temperature .",
    "we assume that these intrinsic components are absorbed by both gas and dust in our galaxy , and so fix this parameter to the value of the galactic gas column ( wabs ) of @xmath39  @xmath12 .",
    "the reddening ( redden ) is linked to this assuming a e(b - v)=@xmath40 ( @xcite ) .",
    "since the optical data were not simultaneous with the uv and x - ray data , we allow for long time - scale variation as a constant offset in normalisation between the xmm - newton data and the optical spectrum .",
    "we exclude the infrared data points from our spectral fitting , since the model we use describes the intrinsic emission from the accretion flow whereas the infrared emission is likely due to reprocessing of the uv emission by dust in the host galaxy , plus a possible contribution from intrinsic starlight .",
    "the resultant best - fit parameters are given in table  [ parametertable ] .",
    "figure  [ sed ] shows the rebinned data ( black ) , with the optical flux corrected for their best fit normalisation of @xmath41 that of the xmm - newton uv and x - ray spectra , and all datapoints are corrected for absorption / reddening .",
    "this model is a good description of the overall shape of the optical / uv / x - ray spectrum and gives a bolometric ( 0.001 - 100 kev ) flux of @xmath42erg @xmath12s@xmath13 , corresponding to a bolometric luminosity of @xmath43erg s@xmath13 .",
    "using our own fitting value for the fwhm , from which the resultant black hole mass is @xmath33 , the eddington ratio for rx j0136.9 - 3510 is as high as @xmath44 ! moreover , if we adopt the lower estimated black hole mass which is @xmath31 , then the normalization of diskpn is 80 , and the resultant disk temperature rises to 31  ev .",
    "the uv region is then dominated by disk emission , though the comptonisation still is required to model the soft x - ray excess .",
    "this gives a bolometric flux of @xmath45  ergs s@xmath13 @xmath12 , giving an even higher eddington ratio of 13.2 !",
    "this is the highest known eddington ratio for an agn ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . these two best fit models basing on different black hole masses set a range for the eddington ratio of rx j0136.9 - 3510 , making it a agn with super eddington accretion flow .",
    "in this paper we report that rx j0136.9 - 3510 is the only well observed , x - ray bright , variable agn which has a similar energy dependence to its x - ray variability as the so far unique qpo agn , re j1034 + 396 .",
    "its eddington ratio is similarly high , around 3 , although its larger mass means any qpo is undetectable in our data .",
    "its broad band sed is also remarkably similar to that of re j1034 + 396 , being well modelled by a low temperature , optically thick comptonisation of the accretion disc spectrum , plus a tail extending to higher energies .",
    "spectra such as this have also been fit by `` slim '' disc models ( @xcite ) , where the accretion rate is so high that radiation can not easily escape vertically before it is carried radially ( advected ) along with the flow ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , simple slim disc models do not fit the curvature of the soft x - ray spectra as well as comptonisation ( @xcite ) , although more complex models of slim discs do include such scattering in the disc atmosphere ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "low temperature , optically thick comptonisation is also occasionally seen in the stellar mass black hole binary systems , for example in the most extreme mass accretion rate spectra of grs  1915 + 105 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recent studies of spectra of the ultra - luminous x - ray sources also indicates that these are well modelled by such material ( @xcite ) .",
    "this evidence suggests that there is indeed a distinct spectral state which can only be attained by super eddington flows ( @xcite ) .",
    "future long duration x - ray observations of agn should reveal additional examples , and in those cases with low black hole masses , the presence of a qpo is a prediction .",
