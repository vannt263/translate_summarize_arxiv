    "let @xmath2 be a body ( the closure of a bounded open set ) in @xmath0 . in this paper , we investigate centers of @xmath2 from three motivations .",
    "the first motivation of this paper comes from moszyska s _ radial center _ of a star body @xmath3 . in @xcite",
    ", moszyska looked for a `` good '' position of the origin for @xmath3 and defined a center of @xmath3 as a maximizer of a function of the form @xmath4 here , @xmath5 is the _ radial function _ of @xmath3 with respect to @xmath6 . a maximum or minimum point of @xmath7",
    "is called a _ radial center of @xmath3 associated with @xmath8_. in particular , when @xmath9 @xmath10 , it is called a _ radial center of order @xmath11_. we refer to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* introduction ) for the historical background of the study on radial centers ( see also ( * ? ? ? * part iii ) ) .    in @xcite , ohara investigated a maximizer of the potential @xmath12 since the potential @xmath13 is defined for every ( not necessarily star shaped ) body @xmath2 , we can regard a maximum point of @xmath13 as a radial center of @xmath2 of order @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , taking the hadamard finite part of @xmath14 for every interior point @xmath6 of @xmath2 , he defined a radial center of @xmath2 for every @xmath15 and called a maximum point of @xmath13 an _",
    "@xmath1-center_.    in @xcite , it was shown that if @xmath16 and @xmath17 , then @xmath2 has a unique @xmath1-center , and that , as @xmath11 goes to infinity , the unique @xmath1-center converges to the _ circumcenter _ ( the center of the minimal ball containing @xmath2 ) of @xmath2 .",
    "it is easy to check that the @xmath18-center is the centroid ( center of mass ) of @xmath2 .",
    "thus an @xmath1-center moves with respect to @xmath11 in general .",
    "the second motivation of this paper comes from the problem `` where should we put a streetlight in a triangular park ? '' proposed by pisa ( programme for international student assessment ) in 2003 .",
    "pisa s answer for this problem was the circumcenter of a triangular park .",
    "in other words , pisa considered this problem as a min - max problem : minimize the distance between a streetlight and every vertex of the park ( the darkest point ) .    in @xcite",
    ", shibata studied pisa s problem in view of potential theory and suggested another point to put a streetlight .",
    "he defined the `` brightness '' of a triangular park @xmath19 with a streetlight of height @xmath20 located at point @xmath6 as the function @xmath21 a maximum point of the brightness function is called an _ illuminating center _ of @xmath19 of height @xmath20 .",
    "the definition of is based on kepler s inverse square law .",
    "precisely , for a point @xmath22 , we define the `` local brightness '' at @xmath23 as @xmath24 and we integrate the local brightness over @xmath19 .",
    "in @xcite , the author generalized shibata s notion for a body @xmath2 in @xmath0 and indicated that the brightness function is proportional to _",
    "poisson s integral _ , @xmath25 here , we remark that , putting @xmath26 in , an illuminating center is an example of a radial center .    in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that if @xmath27 , then @xmath2 has a unique illuminating center , and that , as @xmath20 goes to infinity , the unique illuminating center converges to the centroid of @xmath2 . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the limit point of any convergent sequence of illuminating centers @xmath28 of height @xmath29 with @xmath30 is an @xmath31-center .",
    "thus an illuminating center moves with respect to @xmath20 in general .",
    "the third motivation of this paper comes from the study on geometric properties for the heat equation .",
    "it is well - known that the function @xmath32 is the solution of the cauchy problem for the heat equation with initial datum @xmath33 . a maximum point of @xmath34",
    "is called a _ hot spot _ of @xmath2 at time @xmath35 .",
    "we remark that , putting @xmath36 in , a hot spot is an example of a radial center .    in @xcite",
    ", it was indicated that if @xmath37 , then @xmath2 has a unique hot spot . in @xcite , it was shown that , as @xmath35 goes to infinity , the unique hot spot converges to the centroid of @xmath2 . in @xcite , it was shown that the limit point of any convergent sequence of hot spots @xmath38 at time @xmath39 with @xmath40 is an _ incenter _ ( the center of a maximal ball contained in @xmath2 ) of @xmath2 .",
    "thus a hot spot moves with respect to @xmath35 in general .",
    "in @xcite , magnanini and sakaguchi gave a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a critical point of @xmath34 not moving with respect to @xmath35 .",
    "the condition is called the _",
    "balance law_. precisely , the origin is a stationary critical point of @xmath41 if and only if @xmath2 satisfies the equation @xmath42 for any @xmath43 . using the balance law , in @xcite",
    ", they characterized a convex polyhedron having a stationary hot spot .",
    "( to tell the truth , in @xcite , they studied a stationary hot spot for the dirichlet problem which is more difficult than the cauchy problem . )    among the above three motivations , there is a common feature .",
    "they are the studies on a critical point ( or a maximum point ) of a function depending on a parameter . moreover",
    ", their critical points move with respect to parameters in general .",
    "from such a background , in this paper , we investigate a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a critical point of @xmath13 and @xmath44 not moving with respect to @xmath11 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "we show that the condition is magnanini and sakaguchi s balance law .",
    "furthermore , using the balance law and a stationary @xmath1-center , we give an elementary proof for the characterization of a convex polygon shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 6 ) .",
    "precisely , in an elementary argument , we show that a triangle and a convex quadrangle having a stationary @xmath45-center are a equilateral triangle and a parallelogram , respectively .",
