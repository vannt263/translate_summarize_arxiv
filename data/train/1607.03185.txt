    "the d0 collaboration reported evidence for a relatively narrow peak in the @xmath0 invariant mass not far above threshold @xcite .",
    "the peak was attributed to a resonance @xmath2 with mass @xmath6mev and width @xmath7mev with significance 5.1@xmath8 , while its quantum numbers were not measured .",
    "its decay to @xmath0 implies exotic flavor structure @xmath9 .",
    "the lhcb collaboration subsequently investigated the cross - section as a function of the @xmath0 invariant mass with increased statistics and did not find any peak in the same region @xcite .",
    "if the state @xmath2 with flavor @xmath3 and some @xmath10 exists , it is unique among exotic candidates , as it can strongly decay only in one final state @xmath0 and is relatively far below other thresholds .",
    "this allows for a more reliable , cleaner and simpler theoretical search for it within qcd , which will be elaborated below .",
    "most notably , the next threshold for most @xmath10 choices is @xmath5 , which lies about 210 mev above @xmath2 and is therefore not expected to play a notable role for this state .",
    "the only nearby threshold is @xmath11 , which lies within the width of @xmath2 and it couples to this state only if its quantum numbers are @xmath12 .",
    "most theoretical studies which accommodate a @xmath2 propose @xmath4 . a number of qcd sum - rule studies do find @xmath2 ( for example @xcite ) , but these assume that a continuum of scattering states starts above the isolated @xmath2 pole , which is a questionable approach for a resonance .",
    "reference @xcite finds @xmath2 as a @xmath5 bound state , while all other works @xcite disfavor this option in view of the large binding energy @xmath13mev . a state is also found within the tetraquark models @xcite and quark models @xcite , while other quark model studies @xcite do not confirm it .",
    "the approaches based on hybridized tetraquarks @xcite and unitarized effective field theory @xcite do not favour its existence .",
    "a number of physics scenarios were considered in @xcite , all disfavouring the @xmath2 .    in this paper",
    "we present the first study of @xmath0 and @xmath5 scattering within lattice qcd in order to search for the @xmath2 .",
    "we consider the channel @xmath4 where @xmath0 and @xmath5 are in @xmath1-wave , which is favoured by several phenomenological studies ( for example @xcite ) .",
    "the major simplification in the ab - initio lattice search for @xmath2 comes from the fact that it can strongly decay only to @xmath0 , while the next relevant threshold @xmath5 is significantly higher .",
    "the task is therefore to study elastic @xmath0 scattering . during the last decade",
    ", the lattice community has successfully demonstrated the extraction of hadronic resonances that appear in elastic scattering ( see for example @xcite ) by determining the scattering matrix using the so - called lscher formalism @xcite .",
    "we apply the same well - established formalism to determine whether @xmath0 scattering has a resonant or non - resonant shape . for completeness , we consider both channels @xmath0 and @xmath5 coupled together , which should render a lattice signature for @xmath2 even if it was predominantly a deeply bound @xmath5 state .",
    "note that @xmath0 scattering is elastic in the wide region below @xmath5 , and there the well - tested formalism is reliable .",
    "section ii provides an analytic prediction for the energies of lattice eigenstates in case an @xmath2 claimed by d0 existed .",
    "the eigenenergies from the actual simulation are presented in section iii , where a comparison to the analytic prediction is made .",
    "we conclude that the results from the simulation do not support the existence of @xmath2 with @xmath4 .",
    "the lattice simulation determines the energies of qcd eigenstates with given quantum numbers for finite spatial size @xmath14 .",
    "we consider the quantum numbers @xmath4 , the flavor content @xmath15 , total momentum zero , while the spatial size of our lattice is @xmath16fm . before presenting the energies obtained from the simulation , we illustrate what would be the distinct features in the spectrum if @xmath2 exists .",
    "we will argue that an eigenstate with energy @xmath17 is expected in a scenario with @xmath2 , while there is no such eigenstate in absence of @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath2 appears as a peak in the @xmath0 invariant mass and is naturally considered as an elastic resonance in @xmath0 , whatever the origin of this exotic state may be .",
    "the hypothesis with and without a resonance lead to very distinct spectra of eigenenergies , as shown by solid and dashed lines in figure [ fig : analytic ] . in case @xmath18 and @xmath19 do not interact , they have back - to - back momenta @xmath20 due to the periodic boundary conditions in space , and the energies of @xmath21 eigenstates ( momenta in units of @xmath22 are given in parentheses ) @xmath23 are represented by the dashed orange lines .",
    "the red solid lines represent the expected energies of the @xmath0 system in case of a resonance @xmath2 .",

    "the red curves follow from lscher s formalism by taking the resonant phase shift ( [ bw ] ) in @xmath27 $ ] and solving for @xmath28 .",
    "the resonant scenario predicts an eigenstate near @xmath17 ( red solid ) , while there is no such eigenstate for @xmath29fm in a scenario with no or small interaction between @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( orange dashed ) .",
    "these are distinct and robust features in the spectra , which do not get modified for different parametrisations in the resonant scenario , or for different interaction in the non - resonant scenario .    at and above the @xmath5 threshold",
    ", these states also appear as eigenstates and will be considered in our simulation . for our lattice parameters",
    "@xmath2 is far below @xmath5 threshold and one would not expect a strong influence from that channel unless the dynamics leads to a really strong coupling .",
    "the dot - dashed blue lines show the energies of non - interacting @xmath30 in the limit when both channels are decoupled .",
    "next we consider the unlikely scenario where the @xmath2 is a very deeply bound @xmath5 state , in the limit where it is decoupled from @xmath0 .",
    "then a simulation would render an eigenstate with @xmath17 up to exponentially small correction in @xmath14 , with @xmath31 .",
    "in addition there would be almost non - interacting states @xmath21 and @xmath30 near orange and blue lines , respectively .",
    "for the simulated @xmath16fm , the number of eigenstates is therefore the same as for the resonant scenario .",
    "the values of expected energies are also similar , up to the small energy shifts .",
