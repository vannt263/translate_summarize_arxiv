    "data - driven models of disease propagation are essential tools for the prediction and prevention of epidemic outbreaks .",
    "thanks to important increases in data availability and computer power , highly detailed agent - based models have in particular become widely used to describe epidemic spread at very different scales , from small communities to a whole country or continent @xcite .",
    "one of the interests of such approaches comes from the level of detail they entail in the description of a disease propagation , from the amount of information they provide on the risk supported by each population category and on the probabilities of occurrence of transmission events in different circumstances .",
    "moreover , the range of modeling possibilities is very large , and many different assumptions can be tested on how individuals come in contact , how a disease is transmitted and how such transmission can be contained .",
    "the drawback of this freedom in the model design lies in a certain arbitrariness in modeling choices . in order to alleviate this arbitrariness ,",
    "models need to be fed with information and data concerning population statistics and individual behavior . in this respect ,",
    "a crucial point regards the way in which people interact in their day - to - day life , and how these interactions affect disease propagation @xcite .",
    "the collection of detailed data sets of human interactions is highly needed , as well as the extraction of the most relevant stylized characteristics and statistical features of these interactions @xcite .",
    "understanding which features of human contact patterns are most salient can also help design low - cost methods based on limited information for targeted intervention strategies @xcite .    in order to develop our knowledge and understanding of human interactions ,",
    "novel techniques based on sensors using wi - fi , bluetooth or rfid have emerged in the last decade and have provided important new insights @xcite . in the present article , we consider data on face - to - face contacts collected using wearable sensors @xcite .",
    "the corresponding infrastructure , developed by the sociopatterns collaboration ( www.sociopatterns.org ) , allows obtaining time - resolved data on close face - to - face proximity events between individuals , yielding information not only on the overall network formed by these contacts , but also on the dynamics of these interactions .",
    "previous works have shown that many properties of these dynamics contact times , inter - contact times , number of contacts per link , etc  have broad statistical distributions and display robust features across several contexts : schools @xcite , hospitals @xcite , museums @xcite or conferences @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the contact networks also exhibit different high - level structures in each specific context , which can influence the way epidemics spread @xcite . here",
    "we consider the contact patterns between adults at work , which have been less studied in an epidemiological perspective , even if the influence of office spatial layouts on social interactions has been considered from a sociological and architectural perspective @xcite .",
    "_ a priori _ , the workplace is one of the locations where adults spend most of their time and , as such , may represent an important spot for transmission of diseases between adults @xcite .",
    "we therefore present an analysis of the human contact network in such a place , namely a building of the _ institut de veille sanitaire _",
    "( invs , french institute for public health surveillance ) .",
    "we first discuss how the organization of the offices in departments determine the structure of the contact network and the dynamics of the contacts , and how these features affect epidemic spreading .",
    "we then focus on a new way to determine important nodes in such a contact network , based on the fraction of links each individual has with other individuals in the same department and in other departments , and present numerical simulations of an agent - based model of disease spread in order to discuss the efficiency of vaccination strategies based on this criterion .",
    "in order to collect data on the contacts between individuals , we used the sensing platform developed by the sociopatterns collaboration , based on wearable sensors that exchange ultra - low power radio packets in order to detect close proximity of individuals wearing them @xcite .",
    "each individual that accepted to participate in the study was asked to wear a sensor on his / her chest .",
    "as described elsewhere @xcite , the body acts as a shield at the radio frequencies used by the sensors , so that the sensors of two individuals can only exchange radio packets when the persons are facing each other at close range ( @xmath21.5 m ) .",
    "signal detection is set so that any contact that lasts at least @xmath3 seconds is recorded with a probability higher than @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this defines the time resolution of the setup .",
    "the study took place in one of the two office buildings of the invs , located in saint maurice near paris , france , and lasted two weeks .",
    "the building hosts three scientific departments  the _ direction scientifique et de la qualit _ ( disq , scientific direction ) , the _ dpartement des maladies chroniques et des traumatismes _ ( dmct , department of chronic diseases and traumatisms ) and the _ dpartement sant et environnement _ ( dse , department of health and environment )  along with human resources ( srh ) and logistics ( sfle ) .",
    "dse and dmct are the largest departments , with more than 30 persons each , disq and srh consist of around 15 persons , and finally logistics consists of only 5 persons ( table [ tab : number ] ) .",
    "disq , dmct and sfle share the ground floor , while dse and srh are located on the first floor .",
    "two thirds of the total staff agreed to participate to the data collection .",
    "the coverage ranges from @xmath5 ( dse , the largest scientific department ) to @xmath6 ( human resources ) ( see table [ tab : number ] ) .",
    "a signed informed consent was obtained for each participating individual and the french national bodies responsible for ethics and privacy , the commission nationale de linformatique et des liberts ( cnil , http://www.cnil.fr ) was notified of the study .",
    "data were treated anonymously , and the only information associated with the unique identifier of each sensor was the department of the individual wearing it .",
    "if the ratio of the number of links over the total number of possible links is considered instead of the contact durations , contact matrices represent the connectivity of the contact network ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sm : cml ] ) .      in order to test the effect of spatial organization on the shape of the contact matrix",
    ", we build a null model where only the timeline of presence of each node is taken into account , and interactions are assumed to take place at random between individuals who are in the same location .",
    "the timelines of presence are built from the empirical contact data : a node is present at a given location at a time @xmath7 if it takes part in a contact recorded here at this time .",
    "a node that is present at @xmath7 is moreover assumed to be present during the interval @xmath8 $ ] . at each time",
    "@xmath7 , all nodes that are present in a given location have a constant probability to be in contact .",
    "the probability is chosen such that the total cumulative duration of contacts is equal to its empirical value . the contact matrix obtained , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sm : cm_nm ] , is significantly different from the empirical one .",
    "this indicates that the empirical contact matrix structure is not explained by random encounters of individuals with different presence timelines .",
    "contact matrices : null model with constant contact probability and empirical presence timelines , for @xmath9min , averaged over 100 different realizations .",
    "each matrix element",

    "we consider this issue with the data at hand , by using five different representations for the contact dynamics , from highly detailed to simplistic , and by using each representation as the support of an sir model for epidemic spread @xcite :    * * full data .",
    "* we use the temporal network built from the empirical data at the highest temporal resolution ( 20s ) . *",
    "* heterogeneous static network .",
    "* we use the contact network aggregated over the whole data collection period : in this network , nodes representing individuals who have been in contact at least once are connected by a link whose weight is given by the total contact time of these individuals , normalized by the total duration of the data set . * * global contact matrix .",
    "* we consider that all nodes are connected to each other , and that the weight of a link connecting two nodes depends only on their respective departments : it is given by the average contact time of all pairs of individuals belonging to these departments .",
    "in other words , the total contact time between each pair of departments is equally redistributed among all pairs of individuals of these departments . * * daily contact matrices .",
    "* we consider a contact matrix representation , using for each day the corresponding daily contact matrix to compute the weights of the links between individuals . *",
    "* homogeneous mixing . *",
    "we consider a fully connected contact network with homogeneous weights , computed as the average contact time between any two individuals ( independently of their department ) .",
    "the results of the numerical simulations of an sir model are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sm : epidemics ] for two values of @xmath11 . for @xmath12 ,",
    "no matter which representation is used , most of the epidemics do not reach a large fraction of the population .",
    "the tails of the distribution of epidemic sizes however become broader when using contact matrices or a homogeneous mixing assumption , as the sparsity of the contacts is then not correctly considered @xcite .",
    "this effect is seen most clearly for @xmath13 . with complete contact information ,",
    "i.e. , if the spread is simulated on the time - resolved contact network , the distribution depends on the value of @xmath14 , as discussed in the main text . for small @xmath14 ( slow epidemics ) ,",
    "a second mode develops at large values of the epidemic size . for faster epidemics ,",
    "this second mode is suppressed : the recovery time becomes small enough for the temporal contact patterns to have an impact on the spread .",
    "much less infection paths are available during the infectious period of each node , and thus the epidemics does not spread as much as when @xmath14 and @xmath15 are small ( in which case a node remains infectious for a longer time implying that it has more contacts during its infectious period and the disease has more occasions to spread ) . when static representations are used , and in particular when using contact matrices or a homogeneous mixing hypothesis , the second mode is strongly overestimated .",
    "the second mode moreover is not suppressed when @xmath14 increases , and even shows the opposite tendency with respect to the time - resolved network : as the epidemic spreads faster , it unfolds over a smaller number of inactivity periods ( nights and week - ends ) and therefore tends to reach larger sizes ; on the other hand , the spread during the days does not depend on @xmath14 , at fixed @xmath11 .",
    "overall , these results are similar to the ones obtained in @xcite in a different context and show the importance of using a data representation that includes enough information on the sparsity and heterogeneity of contact networks .    * distributions of the size @xmath16 of epidemics .",
    "* simulations are done for different values of the infection rate @xmath14 , the recovering rate @xmath15 being fixed by the constant @xmath11 ratio . for each value of @xmath14 ,",
