    "in qcd , hybrids are hadrons that can not be understood as combinations of quarks and antiquarks only , but that require consideration of gluonic excitations along with the quarks .",
    "perhaps the most interesting of these are the exotic hybrids , which are hadrons whose quantum numbers are not found in any colorless combination of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and so must contain valence gluons .",
    "hybrids and exotics @xcite have been studied theoretically for decades ( for example , @xcite , @xcite ) , but these early studies are tied to models and approximations that hardly make it possible to choose one model from another .",
    "experiments have searched for hybrids as well , and there are a number of credible observed candidates for mesonic hybrids ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "the author knows of no plausible candidates for baryonic hybrids .",
    "unfortunately , theoretical approaches to hybrids are , naturally enough , even more forbidding than approaches to ordinary hadrons",
    ". so one might wonder what the value of a theoretical paper on hybrids is .",
    "the answer is that recent lattice simulations @xcite of heavy static quarks ( described by straight wilson lines in the euclidean time direction ) with single - gluon excitations provide a valuable testing - ground for theoretical ideas , because one does not have to deal with the extra complication of quark wilson - line fluctuations and because lattice data are available at theoretically - interesting separations of quarks",
    ".    we will be primarily interested in estimating the ground - state gluonic excitation energy @xmath13 of the heavy - quark baryonic hybrid @xmath0 , as a function of a suitably - defined interquark separation @xmath3 , and in comparing our results to lattice data @xcite .",
    "we will also remark in less detail on similar issues for mesonic hybrids , but will not attempt to compare to data in this paper .",
    "the regime where we are on firmest ground is the regime of asymptotically - large large @xmath3 , where the dynamics is non - relativistic ( because the gluon has a dynamical mass ) and we can fairly confidently use the schrdinger equation . however , lattice data @xcite are available for smaller @xmath3 , where relativistic corrections are important , and to cover the entire relevant range of @xmath3 we use a variational principle incorporating fully - relativistic kinetic energy for the gluon .",
    "the smallness parameter for non - relativistic motion is a numerical constant times @xmath14^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath1 is the string tension and @xmath3 the interquark separation .",
    "it turns out that our calculations are in excellent agreement with the lattice data for a gluon mass of 500 mev , even for @xmath3 small enough for relativity to matter .",
    "one should note that in the fully - relativistic regime there should be mixing with other states containing more gluons , such as baryon plus glueball .",
    "additionally , the derived potentials have angular momentum @xmath6 terms as well as @xmath15 .",
    "these lead to mixing of gluonic @xmath6 and @xmath15 states , and should lower the energy slightly compared to the results we give .",
    "this lowering might be compensated by raising the gluon mass .",
    "we do not consider either of these mixings here .",
    "the idea that the gluon has a constituent mass @xmath2 @xcite goes back a long way , but a purely theoretical determination of @xmath2 is not yet within our powers .",
    "lattice simulations have verified this idea and found values for the mass , although many such simulations , done in particular gauges , can not guarantee a gauge - invariant determination of the mass . however , ref .",
    "@xcite has extrapolated their euclidean lattice data to the minkowski regime , to find the so - called pole mass , which is gauge - invariant .",
    "the pole mass so found on the lattice is @xmath16 600 ( + 150 -30 ) mev @xcite .",
    "we believe that our fitted value of 500 mev is acceptably close to the lattice pole mass , given the expected uncertainties in our approach and in the lattice determinations .",
    "there are two main steps in finding the dependence of the gluonic energy on @xmath3 .",
    "the first uses a proper - time technique for describing propagation of the gluon in the hybrid , and the second , as described above , implements the dynamical fluctuations in the proper - time gluon paths with a schrdinger equation modified for relativistic effects . in the first step , we describe the propagator of the gluon in the heavy - quark hybrid as a quantum perturbation on a background of confining gauge potentials .",
    "the center - vortex picture of confinenment prescribes @xcite that the quarks are joined by a y - shaped network of minimal surfaces ( or strings , at fixed time ) .",
    "the gluon propagator has a proper - time form that is an integral over all paths of an adjoint wilson line going along a path joined at both ends to the system of heavy - quark wilson lines .",
    "[ these techniques were developed earlier by simonov @xcite and applied to @xmath12 hybrids , but not @xmath0 hybrids .",
    "simonov s works were unknown to the present author , who developed them independently and discovered simonov s work after this paper was finished . ] as we will see , the result is that if we do not distinguish the three quarks by flavor or other quantum numbers , the gluon can be described as a massive bead attached to the three strings joining the quarks in the hybrid , and fluctuating in directions transverse to the string .",
    "the fluctuations stretch the string slightly , and there is a harmonic restoring force on the gluonic bead . in the @xmath12",
    "hybrid the gluon is a bead sliding without friction on the string joining the quark and antiquark .",
    "all the potentials we use in the second step are harmonic , found by expansion of various minimal areas occurring in the baryonic wilson loop . except in the ultra - relativistic limit and the newtonian limit",
    "this relativistic schrdinger equation is not analytically solvable , but good approximations to @xmath13 for large @xmath3 can be found by a variational technique .",
    "we describe this technique in the appendix . for the @xmath0 system ,",
    "the color - coulomb energy can be straightforwardly estimated classically and added as a perturbation .",
    "it is not quite so straightforward for the @xmath12 hybrid color - coulomb energy , which we describe in the appendix .",
    "the appendix also treats the string energy for the @xmath12 hybrid , finding relativistic gluon energies whose leading term is of the form @xmath17 .",
    "lattice data on heavy - quark @xmath12 systems suggest such leading string - like energies , but with substantial corrections @xcite . these corrections can be estimated with our techniques , but we do not study the problem here .",
    "our final result yields three terms in the large-@xmath3 ( non - relativistic ) expansion of the @xmath0 energy : @xmath18 where @xmath19 are numerical parameters that we estimate with fair accuracy below and in the appendix , and @xmath20 is the coefficient of @xmath21 in the @xmath10 coulomb energy . at shorter distances , where relativistic corrections are important ,",
    "the gluon energy scales like @xmath22 , and coulomb corrections are smeared out by the gluon wave function , as discussed in the appendix .",
    "there are numerous other corrections to the small-@xmath3 results , including spin - dependent terms and poorly - understood terms that arise @xcite when two wilson loops partly coincide , as is the case for quark wilson loops formed from the gluon propagator .",
    "we ignore all such terms , which do not seem to be very large , judged by our fit to the lattice data .",
    "it is somewhat surprising that our techniques give good results even for fairly short distances , considering all the possible effects that can enter .",
    "in gauge - theory dynamics , a wilson line or loop is to be integrated not only over all gauge configurations but also over all possible lines joining the fixed endpoints , with a certain weight function .",
    "this weight function encodes all the particulars about the mass , flavor , and spin of the particle being described by the wilson line . in other words ,",
    "particle propagation is to be described by a proper - time path integral .",
    "we wish to construct the necessary path integral for a gluon in a hybrid state , where distance scales are large compared to the qcd scale .",
    "we will argue below that gluonic spin contributes only short - range effects , which allows us to simplify matters by considering the propagation of a scalar particle in the adjoint representation . in a fixed background gauge potential",

    "of course , the propagator @xmath36 is not gauge - invariant by itself , but we will soon couple it to quarks in a gauge - invariant way .",
    "if ( still ignoring spin ) we identify @xmath36 as the propagator of the potential @xmath37 that occurs in @xmath38 , intractable problems arise .",
    "so we envision the gauge potential as being separated into a confining part ( condensate of center vortices ) that constitutes the background potential and the small - amplitude part whose propagation we are describing ; it is this latter part that constitutes the gluonic excitation in a hybrid hadron . as for spin itself",
    ", the propagation of a vector gauge boson with small amplitude in a background field requires that @xmath39 in @xmath38 be replaced by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 are the spin - one generators of rotations in euclidean four - space , and path ordering is also carried out with respect to the spin operator .",
    "however , the derivative yields the background potential field strength , which is short - ranged .",

    "however , at any reasonable interquark separation , the excited states are relativistic , and there will be some mixing with states with more than one gluon .",
    "as discussed in the appendix for @xmath12 hybrids , if this mixing is ignored there should be several contributions to the gluonic energy , including a stringlike energy of the form @xmath170 , as invoked by @xcite for such hybrids , plus terms of order @xmath22 and coulomb terms .",
    "we noted that the treatment of the valence gluon by adjoint - line splitting suggested a possible path toward describing the fluctuations of surfaces spanning fundamental wilson loops .",
    "originally , these surfaces were envisaged @xcite as having an essentially tangible existence as chromoelectric flux tubes . but",
    "fluctuations of spanning surfaces in the area law is more difficult to think about in the center vortex picture , where the description of confinement begins with the topological statement that the area law arises from the fluctuations in phase factors ( elements of the center group ) associated with topological linking of center vortices with the wilson loop . at this level of description of confinement ,",
    "the area in an area law is a minimal surface spanning the wilson loop and is not subject to fluctuations @xcite .",
    "however , coupling of gluons that are not part of the condensate of confining vortices can give rise to surface fluctuations , as we have seen in the present paper for valence gluons in hybrids .",
    "work is underway to understand the description of such fluctuations when a large number of such gluons are coupled to a wilson loop .    finally , we have not discussed here the mixing of the valence gluon in a hybrid with genuine @xmath10 pairs ( as opposed to the fictitious pairs produced by splitting an adjoint wilson line ) .",
    "if the valence gluon in @xmath0 is replaced by a valence @xmath10 pair , the result is a special kind of pentaquark , or @xmath171 system .",
    "this pentaquark is definitely not the same as the famous pentaquark @xcite , which is of the form @xmath172 , where the antiquark can not pair with any quark to form a flavor - neutral state such as a gluon .",

    "<S> the known string tension @xmath1 and approximately - known gluon mass @xmath2 lead to a precise specification of the long - range non - relativistic part of the potential binding the gluon to the quarks with no undetermined phenomenological parameters , in the limit of large interquark separation @xmath3 . our major tool ( also used earlier by simonov ) is the use of proper - time methods to describe gluon propagation within the quark system , along with some elementary group theory describing the gluon wilson line as a composite of co - located @xmath4 and @xmath5 lines . </S>",
    "<S> we show that ( aside from color - coulomb and similar terms ) the gluon potential energy in the presence of quarks is accurately described ( for small gluon fluctuations ) via attaching these three strings to the gluon , which in equilibrium sits at the steiner point of the y - shaped string network joining the three quarks . </S>",
    "<S> the gluon undergoes small harmonic fluctuations that slightly stretch these strings and quasi - confine the gluon to the neighborhood of the steiner point . to describe non - relativistic ground - state gluonic fluctuations at large @xmath3 we use the schrdinger equation , ignoring mixing with @xmath6 states . </S>",
    "<S> available lattice data and real - world hybrids require consideration of @xmath3 values small enough for significant relativistic corrections , which we apply using a variational principle for the relativistic harmonic oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider the role of color - coulomb contributions . in terms of interquark separations </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 , we find leading non - relativistic large-@xmath3 terms in the gluon excitation energy of the form @xmath7^{1/2}-\\zeta \\alpha_c / r $ ] where @xmath8 are calculable numerical coefficients and @xmath9 0.15 is the color - coulomb @xmath10 coupling . when the gluon is relativistic , @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> we get an acceptable fit to lattice data with @xmath2 = 500 mev . </S>",
    "<S> although we do not consider it in full detail , we show that in the @xmath12 hybrid the gluon is a bead that can slide without friction on a string joining the @xmath4 and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we comment briefly on the significance of our findings to fluctuations of the minimal surface , a subject difficult to understand from the point of view of center vortices . </S>"
