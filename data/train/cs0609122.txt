    "next - generation wireless communication systems demand both high transmission rates and a quality - of - service guarantee .",
    "this demand directly conflicts with the properties of the wireless medium . as a result of the scatterers in the environment and mobile terminals , signal components received over different propagation paths may add destructively or constructively and cause random fluctuations in the received signal strength  @xcite .",
    "this phenomena , which is called fading , degrades the system performance .",
    "multi - input multi - output ( mimo ) systems introduce spatial diversity to combat fading . additionally , taking advantage of the rich scattering environment , mimo  increases spatial multiplexing  @xcite .",
    "user cooperation / relaying is a practical alternative to mimo  when the size of the wireless device is limited .",
    "similar to mimo , cooperation among different users can increase the achievable rates and decrease susceptibility to channel variations  @xcite .",
    "in @xcite , the authors proposed relaying strategies that increase the system reliability . although the capacity of the general relay channel problem has been unsolved for over thirty years  @xcite , the papers @xcite and @xcite triggered a vast literature on cooperative wireless systems .",
    "various relaying strategies and space - time code designs that increase diversity gains or achievable rates are studied in  @xcite-@xcite .    as opposed to",
    "the either / or approach of higher reliability or higher rate , the seminal paper @xcite establishes the fundamental tradeoff between these two measures , reliability and rate , also known as the diversity - multiplexing tradeoff ( dmt ) , for mimosystems . at high @xmath0 ,",
    "the measure of reliability is the diversity gain , which shows how fast the probability of error decreases with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the multiplexing gain , on the other hand , describes how fast the actual rate of the system increases with @xmath0 .",
    "dmt  is a powerful tool to evaluate the performance of different multiple antenna schemes at high @xmath0 ; it is also a useful performance measure for cooperative / relay systems . on one hand",
    "it is easy enough to tackle , and on the other hand it is strong enough to show insightful comparisons among different relaying schemes .",
    "while the capacity of the relay channel is not known in general , it is possible to find relaying schemes that exhibit optimal dmtperformance .",
    "therefore , in this work we study cooperative / relaying systems from a dmt  perspective .    in a general cooperative / relaying network with multiple antenna nodes , some of the nodes are sources , some are destinations , and some are mere relays .",
    "finding a complete dmt  characterization of the most general network seems elusive at this time , we will highlight some of the challenges in the paper .",
    "therefore , we examine the following important subproblems of the most general network .    *",
    "_ problem 1 : _ a single source - destination system , with one relay , each node has multiple antennas , * _ problem 2 : _ the multiple - access relay channel with multiple sources , one destination and one relay , each node has multiple antennas , * _ problem 3 : _ a single source - destination system with multiple relays , each node has a single antenna , * _ problem 4 : _ a multiple source - multiple destination system , each node has a single antenna .",
    "an important constraint is the processing capability of the relay(s ) .",
    "we investigate cooperative / relaying systems and strategies under the full - duplex assumption , i.e. when wireless devices transmit and receive simultaneously , to highlight some of the fundamental properties and limitations .",
    "half - duplex systems , where wireless devices can not transmit and receive at the same time , are also of interest , as the half - duplex assumption more accurately models a practical system . therefore , we study both full - duplex and half - duplex relays in the above network configurations .",
    "the channel model and relative node locations have an important effect on the dmt  results that we provide in this paper . in  @xcite",
    ", we investigated _ problem 3 _ from the diversity perspective only .",
    "we showed that in order to have maximal mimo  diversity gain , the relays should be clustered around the source and the destination evenly .",
    "in other words , half of the relays should be in close proximity to the source and the rest close to the destination so that they have a strong inter - user channel approximated as an additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel . only for this clustered case we can get maximal mimo  diversity , any other placement of relays results in lower diversity gains .",
    "motivated by this fact , we will also study the effect of clustering on the relaying systems listed above .",
    "most of the literature on cooperative communications consider single antenna terminals .",
    "the dmt  of relay systems were first studied in @xcite and @xcite for half - duplex relays .",
    "amplify - and - forward ( af ) and decode - and - forward ( df ) are two of the protocols suggested in  @xcite for a single relay system with single antenna nodes . in both protocols , the relay listens to the source during the first half of the frame , and transmits during the second half , while the source remains silent . to overcome the losses of strict time division between the source and the relay ,",
    "@xcite offers incremental relaying , in which there is a 1-bit feedback from the destination to both the source and the relay , and the relay is used only when needed , i.e. only if the destination can not decode the source during the first half of the frame . in @xcite , the authors do not assume feedback , but to improve the af  and df  schemes of @xcite they allow the source to transmit simultaneously with the relay .",
    "this idea is also used in @xcite to study the non - orthogonal amplify - and - forward ( naf ) protocol in terms of dmt .",
    "later on , a slotted af  scheme is proposed in  @xcite , which outperforms the naf  scheme of @xcite in terms of dmt .",
    "azarian et al . also propose the dynamic decode - and - forward ( ddf ) protocol in  @xcite .",
    "in ddf  the relay listens to the source until it is able to decode reliably .",
    "when this happens , the relay re - encodes the source message and sends it in the remaining portion of the frame .",
    "the authors find that ddf  is optimal for low multiplexing gains but it is suboptimal when the multiplexing gain is large .",
    "this is because at high multiplexing gains , the relay needs to listen to the source longer and does not have enough time left to transmit the high rate source information .",
    "this is not an issue when the multiplexing gain is small as the relay usually understands the source message at an earlier time instant and has enough time to transmit .",
    "mimo  relay channels are studied in terms of ergodic capacity in  @xcite and in terms of dmtin  @xcite .",
    "the latter considers the naf  protocol only , presents a lower bound on the dmt  performance and designs space - time block codes .",
    "this lower bound is not tight in general and is valid only if the number of relay antennas is less than or equal to the number of source antennas .",
    "the multiple - access relay channel ( marc ) is introduced in  @xcite . in marc ,",
    "the relay helps multiple sources simultaneously to reach a common destination .",
    "the dmt  for the half - duplex marc  with single antenna nodes is studied in  @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", the authors find that ddf  is dmt  optimal for low multiplexing gains ; however , this protocol remains to be suboptimal for high multiplexing gains analogous to the single - source relay channel .",
    "this region , where ddf  is suboptimal , is achieved by the multiple access amplify and forward ( maf ) protocol @xcite .",
    "when multiple single antenna relays are present , the papers  @xcite show that diversity gains similar to multi - input single - output ( miso ) or single - input multi - output ( simo ) systems are achievable for rayleigh fading channels .",
    "similarly , @xcite upper bound the system behavior by miso  or simo  dmt  if all links have rayleigh fading . in other words , relay systems behave similar to either transmit or receive antenna arrays .",
    "_ problem 4 _ is first analyzed in  @xcite in terms of achievable rates only , where the authors compare a two - source two - destination cooperative system with a @xmath1 mimo  and show that the former is multiplexing gain limited by 1 , whereas the latter has maximum multiplexing gain of 2 .      in the light of the related work described in section  [ subsec : relatedwork ]",
    ", we can summarize our contributions as follows :    * we study _ problem 1 _ with full - duplex relays and compare df  and compress - and - forward ( cf ) @xcite strategies in terms of dmt  for both clustered and non - clustered systems .",
    "we find that there is a fundamental difference between these two schemes .",
    "the cf  strategy is dmt  optimal for any number of antennas at the source , the destination or the relay , whereas dfis not .",
    "* we also study _ problem 1 _ with half - duplex relays .",
    "this study reveals that for half - duplex systems we can find tighter upper bounds than the full - duplex dmt  upper bounds .",
    "moreover , we show that the cf  protocol achieves this half - duplex dmt  bound for any number of antennas at the nodes .",
    "this is the first known result on dmt  achieving half - duplex relaying protocols . * for _ problem 2",
    "we show that the cf  protocol achieves a significant portion of the half - duplex dmt  upper bound for high multiplexing gains .",
    "our results for single antenna marc  easily extend to multiple antenna terminals .",
    "* we examine _ problem 3 _ and _ problem 4 _ and develop the dmt  analysis to understand if the _ network _ provides any mimo  benefits .",
    "our analysis shows that even for clustered systems with full - duplex relays , all relay systems fall short of mimo , mainly due to multiplexing gain limitations .",
    "the same problem persists in cooperative systems with multiple source destination pairs .",
    "overall , our work sheds light onto high @xmath0  behavior of cooperative networks as described by the dmt , and suggests optimal transmission and relaying strategies .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : systemmodel ] describes the general system model . in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] , we give some preliminary information that will be used frequently in the rest of the paper . in section  [ sec : multiantennasinglerelay ] we solve the single user , single relay problem with multiple antennas for full - duplex relays , and in section  [ sec : multiantennasinglerelayhd ] we solve the same problem for half - duplex relays ( _ problem 1 _ ) .",
    "section  [ sec : marc ] introduces marc , and suggests an achievable dmt  ( _ problem 2 _ ) . in section  [ sec : singleantenna ] we study two problems : the two relay system with a single source destination pair ( _ problem 3 _ ) , and the two source two destination problem ( _ problem 4 _ ) .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusion ] we conclude .",
    "for the most general model all the channels in the system have independent , slow , frequency non - selective , rician fading . for rician fading channels ,",
    "the channel gain matrix is written as @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the rician factor , the line of sight component and the scattered component respectively .",
    "the dmt  for rician channels are studied in detail in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the authors find that for finite rician factor @xmath6 , the channel mean does not affect the dmtbehavior , and the system dmt  will be equal to that of a rayleigh fading channel with @xmath7 . on the other hand in @xcite the authors study the effect of @xmath6 on miso  and",
    "simo  dmt  when @xmath6 approaches infinity .",
    "they find that for large @xmath6 , the system diversity increases linearly with @xmath6 .",
    "moreover , when @xmath6 tends to infinity , the diversity gain is infinity for all multiplexing gains up to @xmath8 .    based on the above observations , without loss of generality , in this work we assume a discrete approximation to the rician model : if two nodes are apart more than a threshold distance @xmath9 , the line of sight component is too weak and the rician factor @xmath6 can be assumed to be equal to zero . thus the channel gain matrix is distributed as rayleigh , and we say that the nodes are in _ rayleigh zones _ , fig .",
    "[ fig : zones](a ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the inter - node distance is less than @xmath9 , the line of sight component in the received signal is strong ; @xmath6 can be assumed to be infinity and the rician distribution approximates a gaussian . in this case",
    "we say that the nodes are in _",
    "awgn  zones _ , fig .",
    "[ fig : zones](b ) .    for the rayleigh zone , the channel gain matrix for mimo  terminals has independent , identically distributed ( i.i.d",
    ". ) zero mean complex gaussian entries with real and imaginary parts each with variance @xmath10 .",
    "the variance @xmath10 is proportional to @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes the internode distance , and @xmath13 is the path loss exponent .",
    "if nodes @xmath14 and @xmath15 are in the awgn  zone , the channel gain matrix from node @xmath14 to @xmath15 has deterministic entries , all equal to @xmath16 and the channel gain matrix has rank 1 .",
    "there is also a dead zone around the nodes , which limits the channel gain .",
    "depending on the locations of the nodes , the rayleigh or awgn  zone assumption results in two important configurations we will consider : clustered and non - clustered . for the clustered system , all the source(s ) and some of the relay(s ) are in the same awgn  zone , and the destination(s ) and the remaining relay(s ) are in another awgnzone , but the source cluster and the destination cluster , which are more than the threshold distance @xmath9 apart , are in their rayleigh zones .",
    "however , for the non - clustered system , every pair of nodes in the system are in their rayleigh zones .",
    "we do not explicitly study the systems in which some nodes are clustered and some are not in this paper , although our results can easily be applied to these cases as well .",
    "the relay(s ) can be full - duplex , that is they can transmit and receive at the same time in the same band ( sections  [ sec : multiantennasinglerelay ] , and [ sec : singleantenna ] ) , or half - duplex ( sections  [ sec : multiantennasinglerelayhd ] and [ sec : marc ] ) .",
    "the transmitters ( source(s ) and relay(s ) ) in the systems under consideration have individual power constraints @xmath17 .",
    "all the noise vectors at the receivers ( relay(s ) and destination(s ) ) have i.i.d .",
    "complex gaussian entries with zero mean and variance 1 . without loss of generality",
    "we assume the transmit power levels are such that the average received signal powers at the destination(s ) are similar , and we define @xmath0  as the common average received signal to noise ratio ( except for constant multiplicative factors ) at the destination . because of this assumption , for the clustered systems we study in section  [ sec : singleantenna ] , the nodes in the source cluster hear the transmitters in their cluster much stronger than the transmitters in the destination cluster , and for all practical purposes we can ignore the links from the destination cluster to the nodes in the source cluster .",
    "this assumption is the same as the level set approach of  @xcite . for non - clustered systems each node can hear all others .    all the receivers have channel state information ( csi ) about their incoming fading levels .",
    "furthermore , the relays that perform cf  have csi  about all the channels in the system .",
    "this can happen at a negligible cost by proper feedback .",
    "we will explain why we need this information when we discuss the cfprotocol in detail in section  [ sec : multiantennasinglerelay ] .",
    "the source(s ) does not have instantaneous csi .",
    "we also assume the system is delay - limited and requires constant - rate transmission .",
    "we note that under this assumption , information outage probability is still well - defined and dmt  is a relevant performance metric  @xcite .",
    "there is also short - term average power constraint that the transmitters have to satisfy for each codeword transmitted . for more information about the effect of csi  at the transmitter(s ) and variable rate transmission on dmt",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite .",
