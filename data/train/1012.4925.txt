    "the dynamical study of the lyness difference equation ( @xcite ) and its generalizations to higher order lyness type equations ( @xcite ) , or to difference equations with periodic coefficients ( @xcite ) , has been the focus of an active research activity in the last two decades . in more recent dates , lyness type equations",
    "have also been approached using different points of view : from algebraic geometry ( @xcite ) to the theory of discrete integrable systems ( @xcite ) .",
    "this paper deals with the problem of the integrability and non - integrability of non - autonomous planar lyness difference equations of the form @xmath5 where @xmath1 is a cycle of @xmath2 positive numbers , i.e. @xmath6 for all @xmath7 being @xmath2 the primitive period and we consider positive initial conditions @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "as we will see , the behavior of the sequences @xmath4 can be essentially different according to whether @xmath3 , @xmath2 is a multiple of @xmath10 or it is not .    in this section",
    "we summarize our main results on   in terms of @xmath2 .",
    "we also give an account of the tools that we have developed for this study that we believe might be interesting by themselves .",
    "we start by introducing the notations and definitions used in the paper .",

    "a non - autonomous invariant is a function @xmath25 , such that @xmath26 for all initial conditions and all @xmath27 on the other hand , when the difference equation has @xmath2-periodic coefficients a first integral is a function @xmath28 , which is a first integral for the discrete dynamical system generated by @xmath29},$ ] that is @xmath30}(x , y))=h(x , y),$ ] for all points in an open set . in terms of the recurrence @xmath31 for all initial conditions @xmath32 .",

    "when @xmath36 and @xmath37 are polynomials then it is said that @xmath28 is a _ rational first integral_. similarly we can talk about _ meromorphic or rational invariants _ , and in this sense we will talk about _ rational _ or _",
    "meromorphic integrability_.    finally , we will say that a planar map @xmath43 has _ structurally stable numerical chaos ( ssnc ) _ when studying numerically several of its orbits , we observe that it presents all the features of a non - integrable perturbed twist map , that is : many invariant curves and , between them , couples of orbits of @xmath44-periodic points ( for several values of @xmath44 ) , half of them of elliptic type and the other half of hyperbolic saddle type .",

    "it is also satisfied that for any @xmath52 there are values @xmath13 , with primitive period @xmath2 and high rank , satisfying the property that all the sequences @xmath4 given by are either periodic , with period a multiple of @xmath2 , or they densely fill at most @xmath2 disjoint intervals , see theorem  [ main ] .",

    "in fact we prove in lemma  [ chaos ] that based on these examples we can obtain values @xmath13 , all different , with a similar behavior for all the remaining values of @xmath2 .",
    "so for all these values of @xmath2 there are situations for which the sequence @xmath4 can have different behaviors to those given in the above situations .",

    "indeed , it is possible to replace the non - autonomous @xmath2-periodic recurrence by an autonomous map on an enlarged phase space of dimension @xmath304 , simply considering the map @xmath305 in this case , any non - autonomous invariant is just an ordinary first integral for the above map .",

    "moreover for an open set of initial conditions @xmath315 and @xmath316 .",

    "we have ( only numerically ) shown the existence of ssnc for @xmath446 , but note that the above lemma allows to reduce all the other cases to these four ones .",
    "although the complicated behavior of the maps , as in figure 2 , leads one to believe that even there may be no upper bound for the number of intervals given by the adherence of a sequence ( formed by the sequence itself and its accumulation points ) , we only present here some simple examples . concretely , for @xmath70 we give a map @xmath29}$ ] and two sets of initial conditions such that the adherence of the sequences @xmath4 generated by   consists of more than @xmath2 intervals .",
    "we have that for @xmath447 and @xmath448 ,    * the sequence starting at @xmath449 is formed by 20 intervals ; * the sequence starting at @xmath450 is formed by 7 intervals .",
    "for instance , this last assertion can be seen by making the phase portraits of the orbit of @xmath451 starting at @xmath452 , which is formed by 5 islands , together with their images through @xmath453 , @xmath454 and @xmath455 and their projections in the @xmath197-axis , see figure  3 .",
    "the property of the existence of sequences @xmath4 generated by   such that their adherence consists of more that @xmath2 intervals should be true for all the values of @xmath2 given in lemma  [ chaos ] .",
