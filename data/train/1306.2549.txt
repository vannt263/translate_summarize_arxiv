    "in the context of general relativity ( gr ) many observable effects can be predicted which are not present in newtonian physics .",
    "einstein showed that the anomalous shift of mercury s perihelion is a relativistic effect , and also the bending of light of distant stars in the gravitational field of the sun was predicted correctly by gr .",
    "most of the exact black hole solutions of the einstein field equations possess a curvature singularity , e.g.  the schwarzschild and the kerr solution .",
    "the physical nature of such singularities is not really understood and , by the cosmic censorship conjecture , they should be hidden behind an event horizon so that the physics outside is not influenced by the singularity .    assuming that the gravitational field of a gravitating object is described by the reissner - nordstrm solution",
    ", then its charge has an additional effect on the periapsis shift of neutral and charged particles @xcite .",
    "it is to be expected that the charge of regular black hole solutions will also couple to the motion of test particles .",
    "this influence will in general be different from the reissner - nordstrm case , in particular close to the gravitating object where the two metrics strongly deviate .",
    "therefore , the observation of the motion of massive test particles and of light near the central object is a very useful tool for extracting information about the nature of the gravitational field .    in 1968",
    "bardeen was the first to propose a regular model which avoids such problems @xcite .",
    "others picked up that idea and a number of models was created which are commonly known as bardeen black holes @xcite . however , these models were not obtained as exact solutions of the einstein field equation coupled to some known physical sources . other black hole models with regular center exist @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , such models , although they satisfy the condition @xmath0 of spherical symmetry , can not be derived from a lagrangian in general relativity @xcite .",
    "another kind of them involves exotic scalar matter , i.e. , scalar matter whose kinetic term is negative @xcite .    in 1998",
    "ayn - beato and garca found an exact solution to the einstein equation coupled to a nonlinear electrodynamics with a physically reasonable source .",
    "this solution does not possess any curvature singularity and , therefore , is regular in this sense @xcite . in the following , we call this the ayn - beato ",
    "garca space - time .",
    "it is uniquely described by two parameters : the mass @xmath1 and the electric charge @xmath2 .",
    "asymptotically it approaches the reissner - nordstrm space - time , and for @xmath3 it reduces to the schwarzschild space - time .",
    "later on it was shown by ayn - beato and garcia that the bardeen model is indeed a solution of the einstein equation coupled to a nonlinear magnetic monopole @xcite . recently ,",
    "various rotating regular black hole models have been presented @xcite .",
    "however , it is still under debate whether one of them can be interpreted as a solution of the einstein field equations coupled to a nonlinear electrodynamics , see e.g. @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will analyze the motion of massive test particles in the ayn - beato ",
    "garca space - time .",
    "we will use analytical methods to completely characterize the motion of uncharged and weakly charged massive test - particles .",
    "in addition , we will present the analytical solution for the equation of motion of neutral test particles .    for most of the common space - times ,",
    "e.g.  schwarzschild , reissner - nordstrm , or kerr , analytical solutions to the equations of motions can be given in terms of elliptic functions .",
    "the motion of test - particles in schwarzschild space - time was extensively discussed by hagihara in 1931 @xcite using weierstrass elliptic functions .",
    "analytical solutions for bound timelike geodesics in reissner - nordstrm space - time were given by gackstatter @xcite and for general timelike geodesics by slezkov @xcite in terms of jacobian elliptic functions and integrals .",
    "in @xcite analytical solutions for general timelike geodesics were given in terms of weierstrass elliptic functions .",
    "a complete account on the motion of ( magnetically and electrically ) charged particles was given recently by grunau and kagramanova @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "references to further work on geodesics in schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrm space - time may be found in @xcite .",
    "a compact treatment of motion in schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrm space - time is given in the book of chandrasekhar @xcite .",
    "for the regular bardeen model , the motion of massive test particles was discussed by zhou et al @xcite and gravitational lensing by eiroa and sendra @xcite .",
    "note that an interesting aspect of solutions in non - linear electrodynamics is the fact that photons propagate along the null geodesics of an effective metric instead of the space - time metric @xcite . for the ayn - beato ",
    "garca space - time the propagation of photons has been studied by novello et al .",
    "the effective metric for photons is quite complex and in particular exhibits singularities at finite distances from the center .",
    "it is clear that the study of orbits around charged black holes is important from conceptual and theoretical points of view .",
    "however , since it is the general belief that astrophysical black holes possess a small or null charge the astrophysical importance of such studies are considered to be of limited applications .",
    "however , there are some discussions in the situation that black holes embedded in an external ( e.g. galactic ) magnetic field and surrounded by a plasma may accrete some charge @xcite . despite of this limitation , there are quite a few studies of astrophysical implications of charged black holes @xcite .",
    "the orbits of neutral and charged point particles around charged reissner - nordstrm and kerr - newman black holes has been completely given by @xcite , and the circular orbits in these space - times have been extensively discussed in @xcite .",
    "in addition , the orbits in extreme reissner - nordstrm dihole space - times have been presented in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "rational orbits and their influence on the creation of gravitational waves have been discussed ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "while the charge of black holes may modify the physics of matter in the vicinity of black holes , charged black holes within some nonlinear electrodynamics theory may also change essentially the properties of space and time @xcite .",
    "within such a framework , gravitational lensing by einstein - born - infeld black holes has been calculated @xcite , see also @xcite which is applied to observations at the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy . a further motivation for our study could be that , since there is no singularity at @xmath4 , a material source might exist for this geometry that could evolve from one asymptotically flat region to another .",
    "it is known that such sources do not exist for the reissner - nordstrm black hole because shell crossings block the passage through the throat between the @xmath4 singularities , see @xcite .",
    "it is also clear that the charge of black holes either for singular or regular black holes will be of importance in the understanding of physics of the accretion of plasma and the creation of jets .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : first we review some general properties of the ayn - beato  garca space  time and derive the equations of motions , in the second and third sections . in the fourth section",
    "we discuss all types of orbital motion for neutral test particles , including the over - extreme case without horizons .",
    "we also analyze the stability of circular orbits and show the position of the innermost stable circular orbit as a function of the charge @xmath2 .",
    "the special case of weakly charged particles in a black hole space - time is also considered . in the fifth section",
    "we derive the analytical solution to the equation of motion for neutral test particles in terms of weierstrass elliptic functions . for this",
    "we introduce a new affine parameter analogously to the mino time @xcite .",
    "finally , we discuss the periastron shift for neutral test particles and close with a summary",
    "in this section we review some of the basic properties of the ayn - beato ",
    "garca space - time , which is regular in the sense that it has no curvature singularity .",
    "this regularity is achieved by coupling to a general model of non - linear electrodynamics .      to obtain electrically charged solutions of the einstein - plebaski class of non - linear electrodynamics @xcite equations",
