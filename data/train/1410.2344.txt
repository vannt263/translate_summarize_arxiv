    "they are advected for two months backward and forward in time by the velocity field in each layer .",
    "the tracking maps are computed as follows .",
    "the region under study , @xmath46 and @xmath47 is divided in @xmath48 cells .",
    "one fixes each day which cells and how many times the markers have visited from 1 september to 1 july ( backward - in - time tracking maps ) and from 1 september to 1 november ( forward - in - time tracking maps ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] and may be interpreted as follows .",
    "the forward - in - time tracking maps in fig .",
    "[ fig9]a show where the corresponding markers in each chosen layer were walking from 1 september to 1 november . in this period ,",
    "the markers from the patches in the lower layers , including the 5th one , rotated around the eddy center with an insignificant flow outside .",
    "the `` tails '' at the upper levels mean that at the surface the eddy expelled water from its periphery in different directions , however , preserving its core .",
    "the backward - in - time tracking maps in fig .",
    "[ fig9]b show where the corresponding markers in each chosen layer were walking from 1 september to 1 july . the patches with markers in the lower layers , from the 7th to 10th ,",
    "practically did not change their form for two months in the past .",
    "it means that the eddy existed in those layers all that time at the same place without exchanging by the core water with its surroundings .",
    "the `` tail '' of the patch in the 5th layer means that the eddy in this layer gained the water from the south , but its core have been at the same place for the two months ( see the ftle maps in the 5th layer in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] ) . as to the surface layer ( the upper plane in fig .",
    "[ fig9]b ) , markers from the initial patch in the 1st layer came to their positions on 1 september from the west .",
    "the ace under study is an eddy - like feature in a region of the jb to the north of the yamato rise ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ]  a ) . that eddy has been found to be practically stationary for a half - year integration period including summer and fall .",
    "it is seen from the lower panels in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] that displacement of its elliptic point for three months did not exceed 10  km .",
    "inspection of the aviso velocity field at the sea surface for 1992  2014 ( http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com ) has shown that surface eddy - like anticyclonic features often appeared in the area around ( @xmath49 @xmath6 , @xmath49 @xmath1 ) in cold seasons and disappeared in warm ones .",
    "no significant directed transport of such eddies has been found in those altimetric data . taking into account these findings , complicted bottom topography in the area with underwater seamounts and trenches ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ]  b ) and observations by @xcite , it is reasonably to suppose that we deal with the ace constrained by bottom topography .",
    "computation of the ftle and particle s displacement in each depth layer clearly shows that the simulated ace evolves of the eddy , that does not reach the surface in summer , into a one reaching the surface in fall .",
    "the corresponding elliptic points , demarcating the eddy s center , are absent in upper layers in summer ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) and appear in fall ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "this finding is confirmed by computing deformation of the model layers and the temperature cross sections . whether the eddy reaches the surface or not , it depends on the stratification measure in the thermocline , topographic and other parameters . in summer ,",
    "when the upper mixed layer is comparatively thin and the stratification of seasonal pycnocline is very strong , the simulated eddy is unstable in the upper layers . in fall , when the stratification of seasonal pycnocline is much weaker than in summer , the eddy becomes as stable in the upper layers as in the underlying ones",
    ".    the eddy must be sufficiently nonlinear to exist as a stable entity .",
    "the measure of the nonlinearity is the so - called quasigeostrophic nonlinearity parameter @xmath50 , which is the ratio of the relative vorticity advection to the planetary vorticity advection @xcite defined as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is maximum rotational speed , @xmath53 the eddy radius and @xmath54 is the planetary vorticity gradient . let us estimate the quasigeostrophic nonlinearity parameter of our simulated eddy in the jb .",
    "taking @xmath55  m  s@xmath4 , @xmath56 m , @xmath57 m@xmath13 , and @xmath58  m  s@xmath4 , one gets @xmath59 .",
    "this range of values means that the relative vorticity dominates and suggests that our simulated eddy is nonlinear and may persist as a coherent structure .",
    "we numerically investigated the vertical structure of simulated mesoscale anticyclonic eddies often observed @xcite to the north of the subpolar front in the japan / east sea .",
    "the model used for experiments was the mhi hydrothermodynamic quasi - isopycnal , eddy - resolved model of a multilayer ocean @xcite with the horizontal resolution of 2.5  km .",
    "the lagrangian approach has been applied to study temporal evolution and a vertical structure of the anticyclonic vortex feature constrained by the bottom topography in the western area of the deep japan basin .",
    "the finite - time lyapunov exponent field along with the field of tracer s displacements have been shown to demarcate lagrangian boundaries of the eddy , pathways and barriers organizing transport and mixing processes at the mesoscales and submesoscales .    estimating the quasigeostrophic nonlinearity parameter of our modeled eddy",
    ", we have shown that it was sufficiently nonlinear to exist as a stable entity .",
    "the quasi-3d analysis has been performed in the period from july to november in a model period of a year when the eddy , visible in summer in the lower layers only , gradually changed its vertical structure to become visible in the surface layers in fall . in summer ,",
    "when the upper mixed layer is comparatively thin and the seasonal pycnocline is very strong , the simulated eddy was shown to be unstable in the upper layers . during october  ",
    "november , when the thickness of the upper mixed layer increases and the seasonal pycnocline is weak , that eddy becomes as stable in the upper layers as in the underlying ones .",
    "we applied a special tracking technique to find out transport pathways by which the eddy exchanged water with its surrounding at each depth level .",
    "it was found that at the surface the eddy gained and expelled water much more intensively than in the deep layers .",
    "the results of simulation were compared with observed temperature zonal and meridional cross sections of a real anticyclonic eddy to be studied at that place during the oceanographic ctd - hydrochemical survey in summer 1999 @xcite . the position and the vertical structure of the simulated ace",
    "have been found to be similar to those for the observed one .",
    "both the simulated and observed eddies have the similar eddy core , the relief of layer interfaces and isotherms .",
    "the results of this paper would thus seem to indicate that topographically controlled eddies reaching the surface may be a state to which submerged eddies might evolve given sufficiently time .",
