    "the line - shape scan of the threshold top pair production cross section @xmath1 constitutes a major part of the top quark physics program at the international linear collider ( ilc ) project that is currently being initiated . because in the standard model the top quark width @xmath2  gev is much larger than the typical hadronization energy @xmath3 , it is expected that the line - shape of the total cross section is a smooth function of the c.m.energy , and that non - perturbative effects are strongly suppressed@xcite .",
    "the determination of the top quark mass ( in a threshold mass scheme  @xcite ) is the most important measurement that can be obtained from the threshold scan since an uncertainty of only around 100  mev is expected@xcite .",
    "this prospect is quite robust , from the theoretical as well as from the experimental point of view , since it relies mostly on the determination of the c.m.energy where the cross section rises .",
    "because the @xmath4 pair is produced predominantly in an s - wave state the rise of the cross section is quite rapid and easily measurable even in the presence of beam effects  @xcite .",
    "in addition it will also be possible to determine the strong coupling @xmath5 , the total top quark width @xmath6 and , if the higgs boson is light , the top yukawa coupling @xmath7 .",
    "however , the latter measurements are sensitive to the form and the normalization of the line - shape . since the observable cross section is a convolution of the theory prediction with the partly machine - dependent luminosity spectrum arising from qed effects  @xcite ,",
    "high demands are imposed on theoretical predictions and experimental analyses to make these measurements possible . in particular , theoretical predictions need to have a precision at the level of only a few percent .",
    "the common theoretical tool to make computations for top threshold observables is non - relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) .",
    "pairs and bound state effects and not for a theory valid only for scales @xmath8 . for the presentation",
    "we use the conventions and notations of vnrqcd established in  @xcite , but we emphasize that our results are generally true . ]",
    "it provides an economic and systematic treatment for the non - relativistic expansion and for qcd radiative corrections coming from high and low energies .",
    "it has also become evident that it is advantageous to use renormalization group methods  @xcite to resum logarithms of the top quark velocity @xmath9 to all orders of qcd perturbation theory in order to avoid large normalization uncertainties of at least @xmath10  % that are obtained in fixed - order predictions  @xcite .",
    "concerning qcd effects at next - to - leading - logarithmic ( nll ) order for the total cross section only the @xmath4 production current has a non - trivial running , which is fully known@xcite . at next - to - next - to -",
    "leading - logarithmic ( nnll ) order for the total cross section the qcd evolution of almost all required couplings is known  @xcite except for missing subleading mixing effects in the running of the heavy quark pair production current .",
    "theoretical analyses for the total cross section at nnll order were given in  @xcite .",
    "currently the normalization uncertainties of the total cross section from qcd effects are estimated to be around @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "while the major focus in recent work was directed on a better understanding of qcd corrections at nnll order , a systematic treatment of electroweak effects at the same level has not yet been accomplished .",
    "electroweak corrections are responsible for a variety of different physical effects . at leading order ,",
    "the three basic electroweak effects are the @xmath0 annihilation process that leads to top pair production by virtual photon and z exchange , the finite top lifetime , which can be implemented by the replacement rule @xmath12  @xcite ( @xmath13 being the c.m.energy with respect to the top threshold and @xmath6 being the on - shell top quark width ) , and the luminosity spectrum mentioned above .",
    "all three effects have so far been treated independently .",
    "it has become the convention that only the first two effects are included into theoretical predictions while the luminosity spectrum is accounted for in the experimental simulations  @xcite .    at the subleading level",
    "a coherent treatment of electroweak effects has not yet been achieved , although previous partial analyses have indicated that they can reach the level of a few percent  @xcite .",
    "it is also evident that at the subleading level an independent treatment of various different electroweak effects will , eventually , be impossible .",
    "since a systematic treatment relies on the consistent separation of off - shell ( non - resonant ) and close - to - mass - shell ( resonant ) fluctuations , the concept of effective theories appears again to be a highly efficient tool to make progress  @xcite . for the @xmath4 threshold such a framework",
    "is already provided by the effective theory nrqcd itself , since it automatically achieves an expansion in the off - shellness of the top quark through the non - relativistic expansion in @xmath9 .",
    "the nrqcd effective theory formalism can be extended to account for electroweak corrections .",
    "for example , including the electroweak radiative corrections to the top quark two - point function in the nrqcd matching conditions one obtains the additional heavy quark bilinear terms @xmath14 in the effective lagrangian , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 represent pauli spinor field operators destroying top and antitop quarks , respectively . for simplicity color indices are suppressed throughout this paper .",
    "the terms in eq.([gtop ] ) reproduce the replacement rule @xmath12 .",
    "they render the effective theory lagrangian non - hermitian because they describe an absorptive on - shell process that has been integrated out from the theory .",
    "nevertheless , they allow for a correct determination of the total cross section from the forward scattering amplitude using the optical theorem and the unitarity of the underlying theory .",
    "in fact , this issue is analogous to the so - called strong phases in qcd amplitudes that are the basis for the search for ckm cp - violation in a number of b meson decays  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend this approach and investigate the role of absorptive parts related to the top quark decay in electroweak loop corrections to the nrqcd matching conditions that contribute to the nnll total cross section .. below the scale @xmath17 gluons , photons and quarks remain as dynamical degrees of freedom . ] for simplicity we neglect the bottom quark mass and set @xmath18 , and approximate the w boson and bottom quark as stable particles .",
    "we demonstrate that these electroweak corrections properly account for the interference of the dominant double - resonant process @xmath19 with the @xmath20-suppressed single - resonant amplitudes for @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we also show that absorptive parts that do not contribute to the @xmath23 final state , and are therefore also not accounted for in line - shape measurements , can be excluded in a gauge invariant way .",
    "this requires to include also fields for the electrons and positrons from the initial state into the effective theory , which act like classic fields for qcd interactions .",
    "the new corrections show interesting features .",
    "they slightly modify the form of the cross section line - shape and lead to uv phase space divergences that are directly related to the fact that the top quarks are unstable .",
    "the divergences lead to anomalous dimensions of @xmath24 operators that also contribute to the absorptive part of the forward scattering amplitude . in the total cross section",
    "these mixing effects contribute at nll order and represent a novel nll effect that has remained unnoticed in previous work .",
    "numerically , the size of the new corrections ranges up to 5% and partly compensates for the large qcd corrections found recently in  @xcite .",
    "the program of this paper is as follows . in sec.[sectionpowercounting ]",
    "we discuss the power counting for the total cross section with respect to electroweak effects associated with the top quark decay .",
    "we introduce the @xmath25 effective theory operators needed to account for the electroweak absorptive parts that arise in top pair production or annihilation . in particular , we show that up to nnll order there are no contributions from interference effects originating from ( ultrasoft ) gluons carrying momenta of order @xmath26 . in sec.[sectionmatchingconditions ] the electroweak absorptive parts of the matching conditions for the @xmath27 effective theory operators relevant for the @xmath28 final state are computed . in sec.[sectionrenormalization ] the resulting nnll corrections for the total cross section are determined and the renormalization of the @xmath24 effective theory operators needed to account for the phase space divergences is discussed . in particular , we compute and solve the anomalous dimensions and determine their contribution to the total cross section .",
    "sec.[sectionanalysis ] contains a brief numerical analysis and in sec.[sectionconclusion ] we conclude .",
    "in this work we are interested in the total cross section and not in any differential information on the top decay final states . we therefore include all effects related to the top quark decay as non - hermitian matching conditions of effective theory operators that describe the non - relativistic top and antitop dynamics and their interactions with soft and ultrasoft gluons .",
    "we employ gauge invariant operators , and the matching conditions are computed for on - shell external lines .",
    "this allows to maintain gauge invariance in a transparent way .    to illustrate the power counting needed to classify the order at which these electroweak effects can contribute let us recall the matching conditions for the bilinear quark field operators",
    "they are obtained by matching top or antitop 2-point functions in the effective theory to those in the full electroweak and qcd theory .",
    "the result up to nnll order reads @xmath29 and includes the terms shown in eq.([gtop ] ) . here , the fields @xmath30 and @xmath31 destroy top and antitop quarks with momentum @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the ultrasoft gauge covariant derivative and @xmath6 is the top quark width defined at the top quark pole . at order @xmath34 ,",
    "@xmath35 being the su(2 ) gauge coupling , the width has the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) is the sine ( cosine ) of the weak mixing angle , @xmath39 the fine structure constant and @xmath40 we use the usual @xmath9-counting @xmath41 , which leads to the scaling relation @xmath42 for the su(2 ) and u(1 ) gauge couplings @xmath35 and @xmath43 .",
    "because the weak mixing is of order one we apply the same counting to the su(2 ) and u(1 ) gauge couplings .",
    "the term @xmath44 is a residual mass term of order @xmath20 that arises if a threshold mass scheme  @xcite is used .",
    "the ll order terms in eq.([lke ] ) lead to the top / antitop propagator @xmath45 although the exchange of time - like ultrasoft @xmath46 gluons contributes at ll order according to the @xmath9-counting , their contribution at ll order can be removed from the particle - antiparticle sector of the theory by a redefinition of the top and antitop fields related to static wilson lines  @xcite .",
    "the time dilatation term @xmath47 originates from the momentum - dependence of the full theory spinors and contributes at nnll order .",
    "the @xmath4 pair is produced by an electroweak process .",
    "as long as electroweak effects are only treated at leading order in the @xmath9-expansion it is sufficient to describe @xmath4 production by a bilinear quark - antiquark current .",
    "however , as shown below it is necessary to include the initial - state @xmath48 fields to ensure electroweak gauge invariance at subleading order in the @xmath9-expansion .",
    "the dominant operators that have to be used describing @xmath4 spin - triplet production have the form @xmath49\\,{\\cal o}_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize\\boldmath $ p$}},1}^j \\ , , \\\\[2 mm ] { \\cal o}_{a,{\\mbox{\\scriptsize\\boldmath $ p$ } } } & = & \\big[\\,\\bar e\\,\\gamma_j\\,\\gamma_5\\,e\\,\\big]\\,{\\cal o}_{{\\mbox{\\scriptsize\\boldmath $ p$}},1}^j \\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] they give the contribution @xmath51 to the effective theory lagrangian where the hermitian conjugation is referring to the operators only .",
    "the index @xmath52 is summed .",
    "the corresponding operators describing @xmath4 annihilation are obtained by the hermitian conjugation . since in this work",
    "we only focus on the electroweak effects related to the top quark decay and , in particular , neglect qed radiative corrections ( including qed binding and the beam effects mentioned above ) the electron and positron fields act like classic fields in the effective theory . in a more complete treatment of electroweak effects , however , their interactions with photons have to be accounted for  @xcite .",

    "where @xmath55 is the vnrqcd renormalization scaling parameter . and",
    "@xmath56 , are correlated through the heavy quark equation of motion , @xmath57 .",
    "the correlated running from the hard scale down to the soft and ultrasoft scales is described by the dimensionless scaling parameter @xmath55 defined by @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "thus @xmath60 corresponds to the hard matching scale . ] except for the qed beam effects , which we will not consider here , the electroweak effects in eqs.([gamma],[cvborn],[caborn ] ) are the only ones at leading order .",
    "in particular , at this order there are no electroweak effects contributing to the coulomb potential acting between the @xmath4 pair , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the ll coulomb wilson coefficient for a color singlet heavy quark pair .    for the nll order approximation",
    "it has been frequently stated that there are no new operators that can contribute and that power counting tells that we only need to consider @xmath63 qcd corrections to the ll matching conditions in eq .",
    "( [ lke ] ) to account for all electroweak effects  @xcite .",
    "however , it was also noted in  @xcite that the mismatch between the @xmath4 phase space in the full and the effective theory leads to additional nll matching corrections for unstable top quarks .",
    "we come back to the role played by these specific nll contributions in sec.[sectionrenormalization ] and ignore them for the following considerations .",
    "thus , concerning nll effects related to the top decay only the one - loop qcd corrections to the on - shell top decay width have to be accounted for  @xcite . in particular , there are no qcd interference effects from gluon radiation off the top / antitop quark or its decay products@xcite . in our approach , which only aims at the total cross section , one can show that such qcd interference effects do not even contribute at nnll order in the non - relativistic expansion .    to discuss the qcd interference contributions we have to consider ultrasoft gluons , which carry momenta of order @xmath64 , because they can interact with a resonant top quark without kicking it off - shell .",
    "for the time - like @xmath46 gluons we already mentioned that their leading interaction with the quarks can be removed by a field redefinition related to static wilson lines  @xcite .",
    "moreover , qcd gauge invariance ensures that the dominant electroweak matching corrections to the @xmath46 interaction vertex vanish because we can set the ultrasoft gluon momentum to zero .",
    "radiative corrections can , however , generate an anomalous interaction in analogy to the @xmath65 in qed . yet",
    "this interaction is suppressed by a factor @xmath66 and can not contribute to the cross section matrix elements at nnll level without even having accounted for additional powers of the coupling constants .",
    "it remains to discuss the space - like ultrasoft @xmath67 gluons which couple to the quarks with the @xmath68 coupling .",
    "in pure qcd space - like ultrasoft gluon exchange contributes to the cross section matrix elements at nnll order and also to the renormalization group running of the @xmath4 production operators at the nll level  @xcite through operator mixing .",
    "accounting for the @xmath34-suppression from an additional electroweak loop correction to the interaction vertex then also leads to a contribution beyond the nnll order .    at nnll order let us first consider whether one needs to account for any operator in addition to those present already at the ll level .",
    "ultrasoft gluon interactions have been discussed above .",
    "soft gluon operators first contribute at the nll level in pure qcd ( for example as corrections to the coulomb potential  @xcite ) , so @xmath34 electroweak corrections to these operators are beyond nnll order .",
    "such corrections can also not contribute at nnll order through mixing since the coulomb potential does not cause uv divergences .",
    "it remains to discuss four - quark operators .",
    "because an electroweak loop would require a factor @xmath69 in addition to the @xmath66 suppression for dimensional reasons , such an operator could not contribute at nnll order either  @xcite .",
    "it remains to discuss @xmath34 corrections to the operators contributing at the ll level .",
    "for the bilinear quark operators in the effective theory lagrangian one obtains the terms shown in eq.([lke ] ) .",
    "concerning the instability of the top quark only the time dilatation correction is obtained , and the @xmath70 and one - loop electroweak corrections to the on - shell top quark width  @xcite have to be accounted for .",
    "the @xmath70 correction to the top width is easy to implement together with the born and one - loop qcd results in the width term @xmath6 and will not be discussed further in this work . on the other hand , for the coulomb potential all dominant @xmath34 corrections cancel due to su(3 ) gauge invariance because in the first approximation one can neglect the gluon momentum flowing into the vertex correction  @xcite .",
    "the mechanism is equivalent to the gauge cancellation discussed above for the time - like @xmath46 gluon .",
    "the order @xmath69 matching conditions of the production operators @xmath71 and @xmath72 , on the other hand , do not cancel and have to be determined from matching to the one - loop standard model amplitudes for the process @xmath73 . at this order",
    "the matching computation can be carried out for an on - shell top - antitop pair at rest .",
    "the full set of one - loop electroweak corrections was determined in ref.@xcite .",
    "for the examinations in this work we have to account only for the @xmath74 and @xmath75 cuts because , as shown in sec.[sectionrenormalization ] , only these cuts are relevant for the @xmath23 final state that can interfere with top pair production . because in ref.@xcite only the sum of all contributions was presented , including the @xmath76 and @xmath77 cuts , we rederive the results for the @xmath74 and @xmath75 cuts in the next section .",

    "we note , however , that it was shown in  @xcite that the difference between the full theory phase space ( which is cut off by the large , but finite @xmath17 ) and the effective theory phase space ( which is infinite in the computation of the forward scattering amplitude ) contributes to @xmath138 and also represents a nll effect .",

    "in fig.[figanalysis]a the sum of @xmath139 and @xmath135 is shown while in fig.[figanalysis]b both contributions are presented separately .",

    "are around @xmath150 for energies below the peak , between @xmath151 and @xmath152 close to the peak and about @xmath151 above the peak .",
    "their magnitude is comparable to the nnll qcd corrections .",
    "interestingly , they partly compensate the sizeable positive qcd corrections found in  @xcite . the peculiar energy dependence of the corrections , caused by the dependence on the real part of the green function @xmath97 , also leads to a slight displacement of the peak position .",
    "relative to the peak position of the ll cross section one obtains a shift of @xmath153  mev for @xmath154 .",
    "this shift is comparable to the expected experimental uncertainties of the top mass measurements from the threshold scan  @xcite .",
    "we have determined electroweak corrections to the nnll top pair threshold cross section in @xmath0 annihilation related to the instability of the top quark .",
    "our approach is closely related to the treatment of absorptive processes in the optical theory .",
    "it includes the effects of the top instability by accounting for the absorptive parts in electroweak corrections to the effective theory matching conditions that are related to the observable @xmath23 final state .",
    "the matching conditions render the nrqcd lagrangian non - hermitian , but they allow for the determination of the total cross section using the @xmath155 forward scattering matrix element and the optical theorem . we have shown that the absorptive parts of the electroweak matching conditions for the @xmath4 production and annihilation operators describe the interference of the double - resonant amplitude for @xmath104 with the single - resonant ( and @xmath20-suppressed ) amplitudes for @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "we have also shown that at nnll order there are no further interference effects caused by the exchange and radiation of ultrasoft gluons .",
    "the novel feature of the nnll corrections is that they lead to new uv divergences .",
    "these divergences originate from the logarithmic high energy behavior of the @xmath4 phase space in the effective theory forward scattering amplitudes , that is caused by the interferences and by the modified propagators of an unstable top quark .",
    "the divergences renormalize @xmath24 operators that contribute to the forward scattering amplitude already at nll order .",
    "the corrections determined in this work slightly modify the cross section shape and are comparable to the known nnll qcd corrections .",
    "the size of the corrections shows that a complete treatment of all nnll electroweak effects is desirable .",
