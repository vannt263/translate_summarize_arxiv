    "[ cja ]    in previous works , we have systematically studied the bernstein problem for complete minimal submanifolds of higher codimension in euclidean space ( see @xcite ) . in particular",
    ", we could prove that a complete minimal submanifold in euclidean space is affine linear if it does not deviate too much from a linear subspace in the sense that a certain function @xmath0 defined in terms of jordan angles is bounded by 3 .",
    "it is natural to ask whether that number is optimal .",
    "now , there is the lawson - osserman s counterexample @xcite to the higher codimension bernstein problem for which @xmath0 is identically 9 .",
    "the aim of the present paper then is to understand this example in geometric terms , in particular in terms of jordan angles . here , the jordan angles between two linear subspaces @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the critical values of the angle @xmath3 between the nonzero vectors @xmath4 in @xmath1 and their orthogonal projection @xmath5 in @xmath2 .",
    "when these jordan angles are constant for all the normal spaces of some submanifold @xmath6 of euclidean space and a fixed linear reference subspace , we say that @xmath6 has constant jordan angles .",
    "this is the fundamental concept of our paper , and we abbreviate it as cja . for a precise statement , refer to definition [ def - cja ] below .",
    "now it turns out the lawson - osserman s counterexample has cja relative to the imaginary quaternions when viewed as a subspace of the imaginary octonians .",
    "harvey - lawson @xcite showed that the lawson - osserman s cone is a four dimensional coassociative submanifold in @xmath7 which can be identified with the imaginary octonians .",
    "therefore , we study such coassociative submanifolds with cja and find that a coassociative graph with cja relative to the imaginary quaternions and at most two different normal jordan angles either is affine linear or a translate of a portion of the lawson - osserman s cone .    for more precise statements ,",
    "we now develop some notation and technical concepts .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath8 be @xmath9-dimensional subspaces ( i.e. @xmath9-planes ) in @xmath10 .",
    "the _ jordan angles _ between @xmath1 and @xmath8 are the critical values of the angle @xmath3 between a nonzero vector @xmath4 in @xmath1 and its orthogonal projection @xmath5 in @xmath8 as @xmath4 runs through @xmath1 .",
    "this concept was firstly introduced by jordan @xcite in 1875 , and they are also called _ principal angles _ in some references , e.g. @xcite . if @xmath3 is a nonzero jordan angle between @xmath1 and @xmath8 determined by a unit vector @xmath4 in @xmath1 and its projection @xmath5 in @xmath8",
    ", then @xmath4 is called an _ angle direction _ of @xmath1 relative to @xmath8 , and the @xmath11-plane spanned by @xmath4 and @xmath5 is called an _ angle 2-plane _ between @xmath1 and @xmath8 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "denote by @xmath12 the orthogonal projection of @xmath10 onto @xmath8 and by @xmath13 the orthogonal projection of @xmath10 onto @xmath1 .",

    ", @xmath20 hence @xmath3 is a jordan angle between @xmath1 and @xmath8 if and only if @xmath21 is an eigenvalue of @xmath19 , and @xmath4 is an angle direction with respect to @xmath3 if and only if @xmath4 is an eigenvector associated to the eigenvalue @xmath22 , i.e. @xmath23 therefore , all the angle directions with respect to @xmath3 constitute a linear subspace of @xmath1 , which is called an _ angle space _ of @xmath1 relative to @xmath8 and we denote it by @xmath24 . in particular , @xmath25 the dimension of @xmath24 is called the _ multiplicity _ of @xmath3 , which is denoted by @xmath26 . if we denote by @xmath27 the set consisting of all the jordan angles between @xmath1 and @xmath8 , then @xmath28 and the angle spaces are mutually orthogonal to each other .",
