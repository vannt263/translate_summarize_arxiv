    "the study of quantum irreversibility @xcite has become lately of much interest @xcite due to its potential relevance to quantum computing , and to the theory of dephasing @xcite .",
    "following @xcite we define in section  2 the main object of the present paper : this is the `` fidelity '' , also known as `` loschmidt echo '' , which constitutes a measure for quantum irreversibility .",
    "the analysis of `` fidelity '' necessitates a generalization of the theory regarding `` survival probability '' @xcite . in section",
    "3 we remind the reader that the latter reduces to the analysis of the local density of states ( ldos ) @xcite .",
    "is it possible to make a similar reduction in case of the `` fidelity '' ? at first sight such reduction looks feasible because the general physical picture looks very similar ( sections  5 - 6 ) .    in the present paper",
    "we claim ( section  6 ) , and prove by a numerical example ( sections  7 - 8 ) , that the study of fidelity can not be reduced to analysis of ldos functions . rather , it is essential to take into account subtle cross correlations which are not captured by the ldos alone .",
    "the object of the present study is common to almost all the `` quantum chaos '' studies .",
    "namely , to figure out what is the role of semiclassical mechanics in quantum mechanics .",
    "whenever we find such ( semiclassical ) `` fingerprints '' , we call them `` non - universal effects '' .",
    "most of the studies in the `` quantum chaos '' literature during the last 20 years have been devoted to figuring out the non - universal features of the energy spectrum .",
    "the main tool in singling out such features is a comparison with the predictions of random matrix theory ( rmt ) .    in the present paper",
    "we use the same `` philosophy '' .",
    "namely , we identify `` non universal effects '' by making a comparison with a corresponding random matrix model . on the other hand",
    "we discuss ( sections 10 - 11 ) a unifying theoretical picture that put the study of `` quantum irreversibility '' in the larger context of phase - space based semiclassical approach .",
    "an important ingredient in the understanding of `` non universal features '' follows from studies of the the clash between `` perturbation theory '' , semiclassical theory , and rmt @xcite .",
    "a major realization is that semiclassical theory and rmt lead to _ different _ non - perturbative limits .",
    "hence the resolution of the clash between the different theories involves the identification of different _ regimes _ of behavior .",
    "this applies in general to the analysis of time dependent dynamics @xcite , and in particular to the analysis of wavepacket dynamics , decay of the survival probability , structure of the ldos @xcite , and naturally also to `` quantum irreversibility '' studies .    specifically , we distinguish in the present paper between regimes of `` perturbative '' and `` non - universal '' behavior , and we define and study a billiard related model , where we have full control over the `` borders '' between these regimes .",
    "the conclusions are summarized in section  12 .",
    "consider a system whose evolution is governed by the chaotic hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a set of canonical coordinates , and @xmath2 is a parameter . later ( section  7 )",
    "we are going to consider , as an example , a billiard system , where @xmath1 are the position and the momentum of a particle , while @xmath2 is used in order to parametrize the shape of the billiard .",
    "specifically , for a stadium we define @xmath2 as the length of the straight edge , and adjust the radius parameter such that the total area is kept constant .",
    "consider some @xmath3 , and define @xmath4 .",
    "assume that @xmath5 is classically small , so that both @xmath6 and @xmath7 generate classically chaotic dynamics of similar nature .",
    "physically , going from @xmath6 to @xmath7 may signify a small change of an external field . in case of billiard system",
    "@xmath5 parametrizes the displacement of the walls .",
    "given a preparation @xmath8 , the fidelity is defined as @xcite : @xmath9 of @xmath6 , then @xmath10 is equal to the survival probability @xmath11 , which is defined as @xmath12 in the general case the preparation @xmath8 does _ not _ have to be an eigenstate of @xmath6 . to be specific",
    "one assumes that @xmath8 is a gaussian wavepacket .",
    "it is now possible to define a different type of survival probability as follows : @xmath13 we assume that @xmath5 is small enough so that we do not have to distinguish between @xmath7 and @xmath6 in the latter definition .",
    "one may regard @xmath8 as an eigenstate of some preparation hamiltonian @xmath14 . specifically , if @xmath8 is a gaussian wavepacket , then it is the groundstate of hamiltonian of the type @xmath15 that differs enormously from  @xmath7 .",
    "thus we have in the general case three hamiltonians :    * the preparation hamiltonian @xmath14 * the unperturbed evolution hamiltonian @xmath6 * the perturbed evolution hamiltonian @xmath7    above we have distinguished between two cases : the relatively simple case where @xmath16 . and the more general case , where we assume that the difference @xmath17 is in fact much larger compared with the perturbation @xmath18 .",
    "the strength of the perturbation is controlled by the parameter @xmath5 .",
    "consider first the special case where @xmath16 .",
    "in such case the fidelity amplitude @xmath19 is just the fourier transform of the local density of states ( ldos ) : @xmath20 for technical reasons , we would like to assume that there is an implicit average over the reference state @xmath21 .",
    "this will enable a meaningful comparison with the more general case which is discussed below .    in the general case , where @xmath22 , one should recognize the need in defining an additional ldos function : @xmath23 in this context @xmath24 is consistently re - defined as the mean energy of the wavepacket .",
    "recall again that @xmath5 is assumed to be small enough , so that we do not have to distinguish between @xmath7 and @xmath6 in the latter definition .",
    "the fourier transform of @xmath25 equals ( up to a phase factor ) to the survival amplitude @xmath26 of the wavepacket .",
    "the physics of @xmath26 is assumed to be of `` semiclassical '' type .",
    "we shall define what do we mean by `` semiclassical '' later on . the same notion is going to be used regarding @xmath27 if the perturbation ( @xmath5 ) is large enough .",
    "in this paper we measure the `` width '' of the ldos of eq.(3 ) in energy units @xcite , and denote it by @xmath30 .",
    "a practical numerical definition of @xmath30 is as the width of the central region that contains @xmath31 of the probability .",
    "this corresponds to the notion of `` core width '' in @xcite .",
    "if @xmath5 is not too large ( see definition of `` wigner regime '' in the next section ) , one observes that @xmath32 the value @xmath33 applies for strong chaos @xcite , and it is the same as in wigner s random matrix theory ( rmt ) @xcite . in general ( eg see appendix ) we can have @xmath34 .",
    "in fact , the value @xmath35 applies to our numerical model , which will be defined in section  7 .",
    "the decay rate of either the fidelity or of the survival probability ( depending on the context ) is denoted by @xmath36 .",
    "the semiclassical value of the decay rate , which is determined via a `` wavepacket dynamics '' phase - space picture @xcite , is denoted by @xmath37 .",
    "the lyapunov exponent is denoted by @xmath38 .    in order to determine @xmath36",
    "numerically one should plot @xmath10 against @xmath39 , for a range of @xmath5 values . in section  7",
    "we are going to define some model hamiltonians for which we have done simulations .",
    "these are called    * lbh : linearized billiard hamiltonian * rlbh : randomized version of lbh . *",
    "mbh : modified billiard hamiltonian * rmbh : randomized version of mbh .",
    "fig.1a displays the results of the mbh simulations .",
    "we see that the mbh decay is well approximated by exponential function ( fig .",
    "the dependence of the decay rate @xmath40 on @xmath5 is presented in fig.2 . the rmbh decay ( fig .",
    "1b ) is badly approximated by exponential function , but in order to make a comparison we still fit it to exponential .",
    "this is done in order to have quantitative measure for the decay time .",
    "thus we have also @xmath41 .    in fig.2",
    "we also plot the ldos width @xmath30 as a function of @xmath5 for the two models .",
    "as far as @xmath30 is concerned the two models are practically indistinguishable .",
    "the inset contains plots of @xmath30 for the other two models ( lbh , rlbh ) . in later sections",
    "we shall discuss the significance of the observed numerical results .",
    "the theory of the survival amplitude is on firm grounds thanks to the fact that it is the fourier transform of the ldos . according to @xcite",
    "there are three generic @xmath5 regimes of behavior :    * the standard perturbative regime . * the wigner ( or fermi golden rule ) regime . * the non - universal ( semiclassical ) regime .    in the standard perturbative regime ( @xmath42 ) the ldos function eq.([e3 ] ) is predominantly a kronecker delta .",
    "this characterization constitutes a _ definition _ of this regime . for estimate of @xmath43 in case of billiards see appendix .",
    "the survival amplitude is obtained via a fourier transform of the kronecker delta dominated ldos function .",
    "this leads to a non - averaged @xmath19 that does not decay .",
    "on the other hand the @xmath24 averaged @xmath19 has a gaussian decay .",
    "the latter follows from the observation @xcite that the first order correction @xmath44 has typically a gaussian distribution .    for intermediate values of @xmath5",
    "the decay of @xmath11 is typically of exponential type with @xmath45 this is known as wigner - type ( or as fermi golden rule ) decay .",
    "it is a reflection of the lorentzian - like line shape of the ldos function .",
    "however , for large @xmath5 we get into a non - universal ( semiclassical ) regime , where we can apply the `` wavepacket dynamics '' picture of @xcite .",
    "thus we find a semiclassical decay with @xmath46 the wigner regime , where eq.([e_wg ] ) holds , is determined @xcite by the condition @xmath47 this inequality can be re - written as @xmath48 .",
    "the elimination defines a non - universal ( system specific ) parametric scale @xmath49 .    in the non - universal regime the width of the ldos is semiclassically determined @xcite . in typical cases",
    "the width of the ldos is proportional to the strength of the perturbation , hence @xmath50 but in some exceptional cases @xmath37 becomes perturbation independent .",
    "specifically , for billiard systems @xmath51 roughly equals to the mean time between collisions , so we can write @xmath52 it is important to realize that the perturbation independent decay ( pid ) of @xmath27 in billiard systems , is a reflection of the @xmath5 independence of ldos function @xmath53 in the non - universal regime .",
    "see @xcite for a numerical study .",
    "a mature theory of fidelity is still lacking .",
    "however , it has been realized in @xcite that the same physical picture as in @xcite arises : for very small @xmath5 we have gaussian decay [ which corresponds to the @xmath24 averaged decay of the survival amplitude ] . for intermediate values of @xmath5",
    "we have wigner - type decay with @xmath54 . for large @xmath5",
    "we enter into the semiclassical regime where one finds `` lyapunov decay '' @xcite with @xmath55 .    in complete analogy with the case of survival probability studies we can define ( via eq.([eq_cond ] ) ) an analogous parametric scale @xcite that will be denoted by @xmath56 .",
    "the semiclassical value ( @xmath37 ) of @xmath29 is not necessarily the same for @xmath11 and for @xmath10 .",
    "therefore in general @xmath49 and @xmath56 are not necessarily identical",
    ".    for simple shaped billiard system the @xmath57 of the survival probability , the @xmath57 of the fidelity , and the lyapunov exponent @xmath58 are all equal to the inverse of the mean collision time .",
    "the perturbation parameter @xmath5 is defined as the displacement of the billiard wall . in the appendix",
    "we derive the following result : @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the de - broglie wavelength of a particle with mass @xmath61 , corresponding to the kinetic energy @xmath62 .",
    "this results holds for hard walled billiard .    in the following we want to demonstrate the distinction between @xmath56 and @xmath49 .",
    "therefore we consider a modified billiard hamiltonian ( mbh ) for which @xmath63 the above inequality reflects the general case , in which the @xmath57 of @xmath10 is different ( smaller ) from the @xmath57 of @xmath11 .",
    "the fact that @xmath11 is a special case of @xmath10 , and the fact that similar ideas ( semiclassical decay versus wigner - type decay ) have emerged in the latter case , naturally suggests that the same physics is concerned .",
    "if it were really the `` same physics '' , it would imply that the main features of @xmath10 are determined by a simple minded theory that involves the ldos function @xmath53 in some combination with the ldos function @xmath25 .",
    "it is the purpose of the following sections to demonstrate that a simple - minded theory is not enough .",
    "the semiclassical pid in the case of @xmath10 necessitates a non - trivial extension of the ldos parametric theory .",
    "our model hamiltonian is the linearized billiard hamiltonian ( lbh ) of a stadium system @xcite .",
    "it can be written as @xmath64 here @xmath65 is the ordered diagonal matrix @xmath66 .",
    "the eigen - energies of the quarter stadium billiard , with straight edge @xmath67 , have been determined numerically .",
    "the perturbation due to @xmath5 deformation , is represented by the matrix @xmath68 . also this matrix has been determined numerically as explained in @xcite .    in the following numerical study",
    "we have considered not the lbh , but rather a modified billiard hamiltonian ( mbh ) , which is obtained from the lbh by the replacement @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a gaussian cutoff function .",
    "this corresponds physically to having soft walls ( for explanation of this point see appendix  j of @xcite ) .",
    "it is important to realize that the `` exact '' physical interpretation of either the lbh ( as an approximation for the billiard hamiltonian ) , or the mbh ( as a soft wall version of lbh ) , is of no importance for the following .",
    "the lbh and the mbh are both mathematically `` legitimate '' hamiltonians .    in the next section",
    "we explain the numerical strategy which we use in order to prove our main point .",
    "this incorporates the random matrix theory ( rmt ) strategy which has been applied in @xcite in order to demonstrate that the semiclassical theory and rmt lead to _ different non - perturbative limits_. the randomized lbh ( rlbh ) is obtained by sign - randomization of the off - diagonal elements of the @xmath68 matrix : @xmath71 the randomized mbh ( rmbh ) is similarly defined .",
    "the purpose in making comparison with `` randomized '' hamiltonian , is the ability to distinguish between `` universal '' and `` non - universal '' effects .",
    "making such distinction is a central theme in the `` quantum chaos '' literature .",
    "usually such `` comparisons '' are made in the context of spectral statistics analysis , while here , following @xcite we are doing this `` comparison '' in the context of quantum dynamics analysis .",
    "the first step of the numerics is to calculate the `` width '' @xmath30 , of the ldos function @xmath53 .",
    "we know from previous studies @xcite that for hard - walled billiard system @xmath30 shows semiclassical saturation for @xmath72 , where @xmath49 roughly equals to de - broglie wavelength ( eq.([eq_deb ] ) ) .",
    "this implies pid for the survival probability . with the lbh we still see ( inset of fig.2 ) a reminisces of this saturation .",
    "note that @xmath73 and hence @xmath74 .",
    "in contrast to that , with the rlbh there is no indication for saturation .",
    "this implies that non - trivial correlations of off - diagonal elements play an essential role in the parametric evolution of the ldos .",
    "( see @xcite regarding terminology ) .    by",
    "_ modifying _ the billiard hamiltonian we are able to construct an artificial model hamiltonian ( mbh ) where the two parametric scales are well separated ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "thus within a large intermediate @xmath5 range @xcite we do not have pid for @xmath11 , but we still find pid for @xmath10 . see fig.2 .    in order to prove that the observed pid is not a trivial reflection of @xmath25",
    "we have defined the associated `` randomized '' hamiltonian ( rmbh ) .",
    "the ldos functions ( [ e3 ] ) and ( [ e4 ] ) are practically _ not _ affected by the sign - randomization procedure : the sign - randomization procedure has almost no effect on @xmath30 . in spite of this fact we find that the previously observed pid of @xmath10 goes away : we see ( fig.2 ) that for the mbh there is no longer pid in the relevant @xmath5 range @xcite",
    "this indicates that the pid was of semiclassical `` off - diagonal '' origin .",
    "we see that both qualitatively and quantitatively the sign - randomization procedure has a big effect on @xmath10 .",
    "therefore , we must conclude that the correlations of the off - diagonal terms is still important for the physics of @xmath10 .",
    "this holds in spite of the fact that the _ same _ off - diagonal correlations are not important for the ldos structure .",
    "this implies that the theory of @xmath10 necessitates a non - trivial extension of the parametric ldos theory .",
    "the purpose of the present section is to explain what type of `` fidelity physics '' can be obtained if we do not take non - universal ( semiclassical ) features of the dynamics into account .",
    "such theory is expected to be valid in case of rmt models .",
    "let @xmath76 be the fourier transform of @xmath19 .",
    "it can be written as @xmath77 where the summation is over energy differences @xmath78 , and @xmath79 is a product of the overlaps @xmath80 , and @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath79 satisfies the sum rule @xmath83 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the number of principle components ( participation ratio ) of the ldos is @xmath84 , then the sum over @xmath85 gives @xmath86 .",
    "thus we conclude that @xmath87 should have random - like phase ( or random - like sign ) character . therefore ,",
    "if we ignore the system specific features , we can regard @xmath87 as the fourier components of a noisy signal .",
    "these fourier components satisfy @xmath88 where @xmath89 is , up to normalization , the auto convolution of @xmath25 , and therefore equals to the fourier transform of @xmath90 , and has roughly the same width as @xmath25 .",
    "it is worth noticing that for lorentzian line shape , which in general is not necessarily the case , eq.([e8 ] ) implies that @xmath91 is characterized by exponential correlations with decay constant @xmath92 .",
    "this leads to decay constant @xmath28 for @xmath93 .",
    "the deviation of @xmath36 form @xmath30 in the mbh case can not be explained by eq.([e8 ] ) , since the latter does not distinguish between the mbh model and the associated rmbh model . in order to explain the pid in the mbh case it is essential to take into account the non - universal ( semiclassical ) features of the dynamics .",
    "the semiclassical theory of the survival probability is described within the framework of wavepacket dynamics in ref.@xcite .",
    "the short time decay of @xmath26 reflects the loss of overlap between the initial and the evolving wavepackets .",
    "on the other hand , due to the ( inevitable ) proximity to periodic orbits , the survival amplitude @xmath26 have recurrences .",
    "however , because of the ( transverse ) instability of the classical motion these recurrences are not complete .",
    "consequently the long - time decay may be characterized by the lyapunov exponent @xmath58 .",
    "possibly , this `` lyapunov decay '' is the simplest example for pid .",
    "it is pid because the size of the perturbation ( @xmath95 ) is not relevant here .",
    "the semiclassical behavior of the survival probability has reflection in the ldos structure .",
    "a relatively slow `` lyapunov decay '' ( due to recurrences ) implies that the ldos is `` scared '' @xcite .",
    "thus the semiclassical ldos has a ` landscape ' which is characterized by the energy scale @xmath96 .",
    "note that `` scarring '' , in the mesoscopic physics terminology is called `` weak localization '' effect .    the above semiclassical picture regarding @xmath26",
    "can be extended @xcite to the case of @xmath27 , provided @xmath5 is large enough . in the other limit , where @xmath5 is small",
    ", we should be able to use perturbation theory in order to predict the decay rate .",
    "thus we have here a _ clash _ of two possibilities : having wigner type decay with @xmath97 , or having non - universal decay ( nud ) that reflects the semiclassical wavepacket dynamics .",
    "the crossover from the perturbative to the semiclassical regime can be analyzed @xcite by looking on the parametric evolution of @xmath53 .",
    "depending on @xmath5 the ldos @xmath53 has ( in order of increasing perturbation ) either standard perturbative structure , or core - tail ( lorentzian - like ) structure , or purely non - perturbative structure @xcite .",
    "the width @xmath30 of the `` core '' defines a ` window ' through which we can view the semiclassical ` landscape ' .",
    "this landscape is typically characterized by @xmath96 features , where @xmath58 is related to the classical dynamics .",
    "as @xmath5 becomes larger , this ` window ' becomes wider , and eventually some of the semiclassical landscape is exposed .",
    "then we say that the ldos contains a `` non - universal '' component @xcite .",
    "whereas lyapunov decay for @xmath27 is typically a `` weak '' feature [ this is true for generic systems , whereas billiard systems constitute an exception ] , it is not so for @xmath19 . by definition the trajectory of the wavepacket",
    "is reversed , and therefore the short - time decay due to a loss of wavepacket overlap is avoided . as a results the perturbation independent `` lyapunov decay '' becomes a predominant feature ( that does not depend on `` recurrences '' ) .",
    "this lyapunov pid has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is clear however that for small @xmath5 we can use perturbation theory in order to predict the decay rate of @xmath10 .",
    "the question that naturally arise , in complete analogy to the @xmath11 case , is how to determine the border @xmath56 between the perturbative regime ( where we have wigner type decay ) and the semiclassical regime ( where we have nud ) .",
    "the natural identification of @xmath56 is as the @xmath5 for which @xmath30 becomes equal to @xmath98 .",
    "how @xmath57 is determined ? there are two `` mechanisms '' that are responsible to the loss of wavepacket overlap .",
    "one is indeed related to the instability of the classical motion , while the other is related to the overall energy width of the wavepacket .",
    "the survival probability @xmath11 can be regarded as a special case of @xmath10 , where the overall energy width of the wavepacket is the predominant limiting factor in the decay .",
    "the separation between the energy surfaces of @xmath7 and of @xmath6 is proportional to @xmath5 .",
    "consequently we typically have @xmath99 .    in the prevailing studies of @xmath10",
    ", one assumes _ wide _ gaussian wavepackets .",
    "therefore the separation between the energy surfaces does not play a major role in the semiclassical analysis .",
    "rather it is the instability of the classical motion that is the predominant limiting factor in the decay .",
    "therefore one typically expects to have @xmath100 , which is independent of @xmath5 .",
    "the above discussed criterion for the identification of the non - universal regime is in the spirit of spectral statistics studies @xcite . in the latter context",
    "it is well known that rmt considerations dominate the sub @xmath96 energy scale , while non - universal corrections dominate the larger energy scales .    in the present paper",
    "we have identified the `` non - universal '' regime for a billiard related model ( mbh ) .",
    "the border between the perturbative regime and the non - universal regime in the context of @xmath11 is @xmath49 , while in the context of @xmath10 it is @xmath56 .    the parametric scales @xmath49 and @xmath56 are similarly defined , but there is an important distinction between them .",
    "the first parametric scale marks the exposure of the semiclassical `` landscape '' : either that of eq.([e3 ] ) or that of eq.([e4 ] ) .",
    "the second parametric scale , as proved by our numerical strategy , marks the exposure of cross correlations between the corresponding wave amplitudes .",
    "the non - universal regime for billiard systems has been identified in @xcite . here",
    "we would like to complete missing steps in the generalization of this result .",
    "we use the same notations as in @xcite .    in the general case @xcite the bandprofile of the @xmath68 matrix",
    "is determined by the semiclassical formula @xcite @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the mean level spacing , @xmath103 is the wavenumber , and @xmath104 is the dimensionality of the billiard system .",
    "the power spectrum of the motion @xmath105 is the fourier transform of a classical correlation function .",
    "here @xmath106 corresponds to strong chaos assumptions , while @xmath34 is more appropriate for our type of system due to the bouncing ball effect .",
    "the width of the ldos is determined using a procedure which is explained in @xcite , leading to eq.(9 ) there .",
    "namely , @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the generalization of eq.(8 ) of @xcite",
    ".    form eq.([eq_g ] ) it is clear that @xmath43 should be interpreted as the deformation which is needed in order to mix neighboring levels . in the standard perturbative regime ( @xmath42 )",
    "first order perturbation theory is valid as a global approximation .",
    "otherwise , if @xmath109 , we should distinguish between a non - perturbative `` core '' of width @xmath28 , and perturbative `` tails '' that lay outside of it .",
    "the expression for @xmath28 can be re - written as @xmath110 where @xmath111 is roughly the inverse of the ballistic time . in our numerical analysis",
    "@xcite we find that @xmath112 , corresponding to @xmath113 .",
    "the non universal scale @xmath49 , as well as @xmath56 , are determined by the requirement @xmath114 .",
    "hence we get eq.([eq_deb ] ) , which holds _ irrespective _ of the @xmath115 value .",
    "the latter claim has been stated in @xcite without a proof .",
