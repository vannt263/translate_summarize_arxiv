    "entanglement  @xcite has long played a pivotal role in many quantum information processing tasks , such as secure communication using quantum - key distribution  @xcite , teleportation of quantum states  @xcite , quantum computation  @xcite , reduction in communication complexity  @xcite , and more recently , expansion and certification of randomness  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the verification and quantification of this resource present in quantum systems is often an indispensable part of quantum - information processing ( qip ) protocols .",
    "traditionally , for low - dimensional composite systems that are made up of only a few subsystems , the process of entanglement certification and/or quantification is carried out using complete quantum state tomography followed by the application of certain separability criteria  @xcite .",
    "this approach , however , suffers from the drawbacks that it is unnecessarily resource intensive and that the procedure of tomography may already be intractable for a physical system that is made up of only a handful of qubits ( see , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "more recently , there has been considerable interest in verifying the presence of entanglement by measuring directly the expectation value of so - called _ entanglement witnesses _  @xcite .",
    "while this latter approach is much more economical in terms of both the number of measurement settings and the resource required for classical post - processing @xcite , it still requires detailed knowledge of the actual measurements performed on the physical system in question .",
    "this last feature is , of course , undesirable as there are examples of entanglement witnesses that are extremely fragile to the perturbations of the constituent measurement operators  @xcite .",
    "also , in some qip tasks such as quantum key distribution , it is highly desirable to make minimal assumptions on the devices used in the protocol .",
    "in contrast , violation of bell - type inequalities  @xcite is only a statement about the measurement statistics derived from an experiment .",
    "since entanglement is a prerequisite for bell - inequality violation  @xcite , one can deduce the presence of entanglement via a bell - inequality violation without resorting to any knowledge of the actual physical implementation of the measurements .",
    "in modern terminology , bell - type inequalities therefore serve as _ device - independent entanglement witnesses _ and can be used for device - independent quantum - key distribution @xcite , state estimation @xcite , randomness generation @xcite , as well as self - testing quantum circuits @xcite .    for a long time",
    ", it was thought that the strength of bell inequality violation is monotonously related to the degree of entanglement ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for a review on this topic ) ; that is , loosely speaking , more entanglement would lead to more nonlocality .",
    "it turns out that the relation between entanglement and nonlocality is much more intricate @xcite .",
    "however , for the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) bell inequality @xcite , it was shown by verstraete and wolf @xcite that the _ maximal _ possible chsh violation of a two - qubit state is monotonously related to the entanglement of the latter . from this result , it is then easy to lower bound the entanglement of a two - qubit state given the observed chsh violation ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    on the other hand , bell inequality violation",
    " as we demonstrate in this paper  can also be used to upper bound the entanglement of the underlying state . to achieve this , we present and make use of a family of clauser - horne - like  @xcite bell inequalities ( i.e. , involving two binary measurements per party ) that are violated maximally by non - maximally entangled states . moreover , it can be shown that some of these inequalities _ can not _ be violated maximally by maximally entangled states of any dimensions .",
    "this complements the recent result of junge and palazuelos @xcite , who proved the existence of such inequalities .",
    "naturally , our inequalities suggest another _ device - independent _ application of bell inequalities , namely , to bound  from above and below ",
    "the entanglement present in some underlying quantum system directly from the measurement statistics .",
    "however , in contrast with the scenario considered in _ device - independent quantum - key distributions _",
    "@xcite , here we assume that the dimension of the underlying hilbert space is known . to distinguish the present approach ( where the dimension of the hilbert space is assumed ) from the conventional device - independent approach , hereafter , we will refer to our scenario as _ semi - device - independent_. we focus on a scenario where the experimentalists know on which degree of freedom of the system the measurements are performed  thus the relevant hilbert space dimension can be determined  but nothing is assumed about the alignment of the measuring devices .",
    "we believe this represents a significant advantage compared to previous techniques , such as entanglement witnesses and tomography , for which small alignment errors can lead to important errors in the estimation of entanglement  @xcite .",
    "we note also that it seems unlikely that one can find any useful bounds without such assumption on the dimensionality of the systems , as we discuss later .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : prelim ] , we introduce a class of bell inequalities that will serve as our main tools for bounding entanglement .",
    "then , in sec .  [ sec : maxviolation ] , we investigate the quantum violations of these inequalities by maximally entangled states ( the relevant proof is relegated to appendix  [ app : proofs ] ) .",
    "after that , in sec .",
    "[ sec : bounds : qubits ] , we illustrate how these bell inequalities can be used to provide nontrivial lower and upper bounds on the entanglement of a two - qubit state . in sec .",
    "[ sec : qudits ] , we briefly comment on the applicability of these tools to the scenario where one makes no assumption of the dimension of the underlying quantum systems .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] by comparing our approach with the one presented of ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of device - independent state estimation , and highlighting some possible avenues for future research . in appendix",
    "[ app : projective ] , we also provide another method of upper bounding entanglement assuming that the measurements are projective .",
    "in this section , we first introduce the notations and briefly review the tools that we are going to use in the subsequent analysis . to this end , we consider the simplest scenario where two experimenters alice and bob have access to many copies of a shared quantum state @xmath0 and after many rounds of experiment , the bipartite conditional probability distributions @xmath1 are estimated from the experimental data . here , @xmath2 refers to the joint probability that the outcomes @xmath3 and @xmath4 are observed at alice s and bob s site respectively , conditioned on her performing the @xmath5 and him performing the @xmath6 measurement . clearly , from @xmath7 , the respective marginal probabilities @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    "can also be determined .",
    "our goal here is to obtain some non - trivial bounds on the entanglement of the underlying state from these measurement statistics .",
    "our starting point is the following one - parameter family of modified clauser - horne ( ch ) polynomials :    [ eq : bellfunction : tiltedch ] @xmath10 where @xmath11    for @xmath12 .",
    "it is a well - known fact  @xcite that with local measurements , separable states can only give rise to probability distributions that can be reproduced by _ shared randomness _ , and hence any measurement statistics that originate from such states must satisfy the bell inequality @xmath13 note that this particular bell inequality arises naturally in the study of the detection loophole in bell experiments . here",
    "the parameter @xmath14 can be interpreted as the ( symmetric ) detection efficiency  @xcite .    for @xmath15 ,",
    "the bell inequality @xmath16 reduces to the ch inequality  @xcite which , in turn , is equivalent to the well - known chsh inequality  @xcite .",
    "thus , we can also rewrite eq .",
    "as @xmath17 ,      \\label{eq : bellfunction : tiltedch : viach}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the ch polynomial . from eq .  , it is clear that for any @xmath19 we can see @xmath16 as an inequality that consists of a conic combination of the ch inequality and some positivity constraints on joint probabilities . as a result , any measurement statistics that violate inequality   with @xmath20 must also violate the ch inequality .",
    "moreover , it is easily checked that any legitimate probability distribution always satisfies inequality for @xmath21 , since @xmath16 corresponds to a conic combination of positivity constraints in these cases .",
    "henceforth , we restrict our attention to the scenarios where @xmath22 .    in the following discussion , we denote by @xmath23 the positive - operator - valued measure ( povm ) element associated with the @xmath3-th outcome of alice s @xmath24-th measurement ( likewise @xmath25 for bob s ) . for any quantum state @xmath0 , we then write the corresponding quantum expectation value of @xmath26 under these measurement operators as : @xmath27 the corresponding maximal quantum violation of inequality   for @xmath0 is denoted by : @xmath28 whereas the maximal violation of inequality   allowed by quantum mechanics is denoted by @xmath29",
    "as mentioned in sec .  [ sec : introduction ] , an important feature of @xmath16 that allows us to establish _ upper _ bound on the underlying entanglement is that , except for @xmath15 , it is a bell inequality that is violated maximally by non - maximally entangled two - qubit states ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : concurrencevstau ] ) . a natural question that one may ask",
    "is whether it is possible to recover the maximal quantum violation of @xmath16 if we also consider maximally entangled states of higher dimension .",
    "we show in appendix  [ app : mes : nmaxbiv ] that this is not possible for a large range of @xmath30 , as summarized in the theorem below  @xcite .",

    "all states with @xmath36 do not violate @xmath16 ( see text at sec .",
    "[ sec : ub : biv ] for details ) ; hence , the violation of @xmath16 allows one to derive upper bounds on the entanglement.,width=340 ]    in relation to this , it is worth noting that for two - qubit states , one can show that the maximally entangled state can not even violate @xmath16 for the same interval of @xmath30 ( let alone maximally ) . for higher dimensional",
    "maximally entangled states , despite intensive numerical search , we have also not found any violation of @xmath16 with @xmath31 for local hilbert space dimension up to @xmath37 .",
    "we believe that this feature holds for maximally entangled states of arbitrary dimensions  @xcite .",
    "no finite - dimensional maximally entangled state can violate @xmath16 with @xmath31 .",
    "to illustrate the idea of bounding entanglement directly from measurement statistics , we now consider the specific case where the underlying quantum system can be described as a two - qubit state .",
    "it is worth noting that in this case , the entanglement of a quantum state @xmath0 is fully characterized in terms of its _ entanglement of formation _ , which is monotonically related to the _ concurrence _ , defined as  @xcite @xmath38,\\ ] ] where @xmath39 are the decreasingly ordered eigenvalues of @xmath40 , @xmath41 is the pauli-@xmath42 matrix , and the transposition @xmath43 is to be carried out in any product basis .",

    "eq .  , ] which we denote by @xmath44 .",
    "clearly , if @xmath44 corresponds to the maximal violation of @xmath16 for some @xmath30 , we can identify the concurrence of the underlying two - qubit state immediately with the help of fig .",

    "@xcite that for any two - qubit state @xmath0 @xmath46 it then follows from simple calculation that  @xcite @xmath47 where the second inequality follows from the fact that in general , @xmath48 , since the measurements operators @xmath49 may not be optimal .",
    "also , it is worth noting that the first inequality in eq .   can be saturated by pure states as well as some rank 2 mixed two - qubit states  @xcite .    as a result of eq .",
    ", for any measurement statistics that violate inequality  , that is , giving @xmath50 , we know that its concurrence is bounded from below according to eq .  .      to obtain a semi - device - independent upper bound on the concurrence of @xmath0 , we make use of @xmath51 for a general two - qubit pure state @xmath0 , cf .",

    ", width=302 ]    an important point to stress now is that although the upper bound obtained using the above procedures was derived from two - qubit pure state , the same bound is also applicable to any two - qubit mixed state @xmath0 .",
    "this follows from the fact that any @xmath0 having concurrence @xmath32 can always be written as a convex decomposition of pure states , each having concurrence @xmath32  @xcite and that @xmath51 is linear in the convex decomposition of @xmath0 .",
    "note also that stronger bounds can be obtained under the additional assumption that the measurements are projective ( see appendix  [ app : projective ] ) .      to see how these bounds work in practice ,",
    "let us consider the following measurement statistics that were gathered  @xcite using a commercially available setup for producing a maximally entangled two - qubit state  @xcite .",
    "@xmath69    where @xmath70 .    a simple calculation using eq",
    ".   shows that the underlying two - qubit state that generates these probability distributions must have its concurrence lower bounded by 0.9297 .",
    "incidentally , these probability distributions also violate @xmath16 up until @xmath71 . using eq .",
    ", this gives an upper bound on concurrence of 0.9999  @xcite .",
    "if we further make use of that fact the measurements that give rise to eq .",
    "are projective [ cf .",
    "appendix  [ app : projective ] ] , then this upper bound can be improved further via eq .   to 0.9806 .",
    "let us now relax the assumption that the given quantum system ( or more precisely , its degrees of freedom where the measurements were performed ) are qubits and see what we can learn from the measurement statistics . in general ,",
    "as one might expect , it is very difficult to derive any useful bounds on the entanglement of the underlying state if we are only given @xmath7 .",
    "there are , nonetheless , exceptional cases where concrete statements can be made about the underlying state even in the scenario where we are only given a small set of independent numbers , such as @xmath7 .",
    "the first example is when the measurement statistics give @xmath72 . in this case , the correlations between the measurement outcomes gives rise to the so - called tsirelon bound  @xcite the maximal possible quantum violation of the ch ( or chsh ) inequality .",
    "it was known since the early 1990s that in this case the underlying state must be even - dimensional , and is either a coherent superposition or an incoherent mixture of two - qubit maximally entangled states that reside in orthogonal two - qubit subspaces  @xcite .    likewise , if we denote by @xmath73 the unique two - qubit pure state ( in the form of @xmath55 ) that maximally violates @xmath16 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : concurrencevstau ] ) , then from the work of masanes  @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , one can show that the underlying quantum state must also be even - dimensional , and can either be a coherent superposition or an incoherent mixture of @xmath73 that reside in orthogonal two - qubit subspaces .    clearly , these examples indicate that when the dimension of the hilbert space is not known , then even in these extremal cases , it is possible to have a wide spectrum of states , featuring different amounts of entanglement , that give rise to the same correlations .",
    "hence , as long as we restrict ourself to the framework where only @xmath7 are given , it seems extremely challenging to construct any useful bounds on the underlying entanglement in a fully device - independent manner .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the possibility of bounding the entanglement of some underlying quantum state directly from measurement statistics , specifically from a given set of probability distributions @xmath7 .",
    "our main tool is a family of bell - type inequalities whose maximal violation can not be obtained from maximally entangled states of any dimension . using these inequalities ,",
    "we have illustrated how useful lower and upper bounds on the concurrence of some underlying two - qubit state may be constructed in a semi - device - independent manner . in the case where the measurements are known to be projective , we also demonstrated how another upper bound can be obtained by analyzing the marginal probabilities given .",
    "an interesting issue is to compare our approach with the one of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the authors investigate device - independent state estimation based on the chsh inequality violation .",
    "the main differences between these two approaches are as follows . on the one hand , the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite does not require any assumption about the hilbert space dimension of the systems , in contrast to our approach .",
    "on the other hand , the observed chsh violation @xmath74 considered in ref .",
    "@xcite is actually @xmath75 , where @xmath76 refers to some local ( nonunitary ) , completely positive map acting on the original state @xmath0 , whereas in the present paper , we use directly @xmath77 to establish the bounds .",
    "moreover , in the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , the measurements that give rise to @xmath75 are assumed to be optimal for @xmath78 , whereas we make no such assumption .    in general",
    ", it would be interesting to derive useful ( semi-)device - independent bounds on entanglement for higher dimensional systems .",
    "admittedly , the bell inequalities that we have considered here do not seem to provide useful bounds , as one may already anticipate from earlier work on dimension witnesses  @xcite .",
    "however , given that there are other bell inequalities  @xcite that are more suitable for higher dimensional quantum systems , it will be interesting to investigate if analogous bounds on , say , the generalized concurrence can be derived using these other inequalities .    as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : prelim ] , the bell inequalities that we have considered here are closely related to those being used in the analysis of detection loopholes  @xcite .",
    "another possible avenue for future research is to exploit results established in these earlier studies  @xcite to establish or improve bounds on entanglement beyond what we have derived in this paper .",
    "finally , let us remark that for some quantum resources such as the @xmath79-partite greenberger - horne - zeilinger state , it was shown that there is a high probability of finding bell - inequality violations by performing local measurements in randomly chosen bases @xcite .",
    "if we can also establish non - trivial bounds on multipartite entanglement directly from these measurement statistics , then together , these approaches may offer a much more resource - economical paradigm for characterizing quantum states produced in the laboratory . from a quantum information processing point of view , this is the ultimate goal that we hope to achieve with the approach taken in this paper .",
    "note , however , that in the multipartite scenario , the possibility of bounding entanglement directly from measurement statistics may also become highly non - trivial , as there is no natural choice of entanglement measure , and the whole problem also becomes considerably more complicated .",

    "<S> detection and quantification of entanglement in quantum resources are two key steps in the implementation of various quantum - information processing tasks . here </S>",
    "<S> , we show that bell - type inequalities are not only useful in verifying the presence of entanglement but can also be used to bound the entanglement of the underlying physical system . </S>",
    "<S> our main tool consists of a family of clauser - horne - like bell inequalities that can not be violated maximally by any finite - dimensional maximally entangled state . using these inequalities , we demonstrate the explicit construction of both lower and upper bounds on the concurrence for two - qubit states . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that these bounds arise from bell - type inequalities also allows them to be obtained in a semi - device - independent manner , that is , with assumption of the dimension of the hilbert space but without resorting to any knowledge of the actual measurements being performed on the individual subsystems . </S>"
