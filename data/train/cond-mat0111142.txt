    "the self - consistent ornstein - zernike approach ( scoza ) was introduced by hye and stell@xcite as an approximation method specifically tailored to obtain structure factors and thermodynamics for hamiltonian models in three or more spatial dimensions .",
    "it was subsequently found by hye and borge@xcite that the scoza yields extremely accurate results for the two - dimensional lattice gas as well , when appropriately used , thus opening the way toward the use of scoza in treating thin - film problems . in this article",
    "we summarize the two - dimensional scoza results .",
    "we point out that those results for systems considered in the thermodynamic limit are strikingly similar to the results that would be found in an exact analysis of two - dimensional systems that are finite@xcite or semi - infinite@xcite .",
    "we note why this is to be expected , and using the behavior of the specific heat as a criterion , we find the size of the finite and semi - infinite systems that yield the best match to the scoza results for the infinite square lattice .",
    "the scoza is based on an ansatz used by ornstein and zernike@xcite , which is that the direct correlation function @xmath0 introduced by those authors has the range of the pair potential . in scoza , this ansatz is used along with a core condition that guarantees that the two - body distribution function @xmath1 must be zero for values of @xmath2 for which the pair potential is infinite . in a lattice gas , the core - condition implies the exclusion of multiple occupancy of a single lattice site or cell ; for the equivalent ising model in which the spin variable at site @xmath3 is + 1 or -1 , the corresponding condition is that @xmath4 , which simply reflects the fact that the spin must be pointing either up or down with probability one .",
    "an analysis of the ornstein - zernike formalism made by one of the authors some time ago@xcite showed that the core condition plus the assumption that @xmath0 is proportional to the pair potential implies that for short - ranged potentials , a two - dimensional system can not have a critical point at nonzero temperature .",
    "( in three or more dimensions there is no such restriction on criticality . )",
    "one knows however , that in two dimensions , systems such as the nearest - neighbor lattice gas do in fact have a critical point at nonzero @xmath5 .",
    "hence scoza did not initially appear to be a promising method for treating arbitrarily large two - dimensional1 systems .",
    "its apparent unsuitability is also consistent with the observation@xcite that the assumption that @xmath0 has the range of the potential implies that for short - ranged potentials , the critical exponent @xmath6 , so that at a critical point at @xmath7 , where on expects @xmath8 , scoza would yield @xmath9 . in three dimensions , in which @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , this leads to negligible error .",
    "but for @xmath12 , in which @xmath13 , it represents the difference between @xmath14 and a @xmath15 that does not appropriately decay with increasing @xmath16 .    however , as we shall see below , in two dimensions , the scoza results for a square lattice of infinite extent are strikingly similar in some respects to exact results for either an @xmath17 lattice or an @xmath18 lattice , with @xmath19 .",
    "it is not hard to understand why the assumption of a @xmath20 for an infinite square lattice yields results that mimic exact results for a finite system . for a finite system ,",
    "@xmath20 is limited in range by the finite boundaries of the system .",
    "one also knows that in an exact analysis of an infinite one - dimensional system with short - ranged potential one finds no critical behavior for non - zero temperature . from these qualitative statements",
    "however , it is not clear what values of @xmath21 in an @xmath22 or @xmath23 lattice will give rise to exact results that most closely match scoza results for an infinite square lattice . as we shall see in section iv , when one uses the behavior of the specific heat as a criterion , @xmath21 turns out to be around @xmath24 .",
    "in the following we consider the two - dimensional square lattice gas , which is isomorphic to the two - dimensional ising model .",
    "the potential between particles is @xmath25 for convenience @xmath26 is scaled to be @xmath27 in our calculations . in this convention the internal energy per spin for the ising model @xmath28",
    "is related to the internal energy per particle for the lattice gas @xmath29 via the following relation : u = u + 12 q - q , where @xmath30 is the number of nearest neighbors ( @xmath31 for the square lattice ) , and @xmath32 is the density for the lattice gas .",
    "scoza is based on the enforcement of thermodynamic consistency between different routes to thermodynamics .",
    "this imposes the following relation : = , [ consistency ] where @xmath33 , the inverse temperature , @xmath34 is the isothermal compressibility , and @xmath29 is the internal energy per particle for the lattice gas .",
    "these quantities can be given in terms of correlation functions through fluctuation theory , which yields ^-1= , [ chi1 ] and through the ensemble average of the hamiltonian , which yields u = -qg_1 = -q(1+h_1 ) , [ energy ] where @xmath35 , and @xmath1 is the two - body distribution function . here",
    "@xmath36 and @xmath37 represent the functional values of @xmath1 and @xmath38 at nearest - neighbor positions , and @xmath39 is the fourier transform of @xmath38 , which is related to the direct correlation function @xmath0 by the ornstein - zernike equation : h(*r_i * ) = c(*r_i * ) + _ j c(*r_j * ) h(*r_i*-*r_j * ) , [ oz ] or in the fourier - transformed space : 1+(*k * ) = .",
    "[ fourier ]    the above relations are exact . in order to proceed",
    "we shall approximate the form of the direct correlation function @xmath0 by using the ansatz introduced by ornstein and zernike ( oz ) that @xmath0 has the range of the pair potential . in scoza",
    "this can be done by generalizing somewhat the mean spherical approximation ( msa ) , in which ( * k * ) = c_0 + q c_1 ( * k * ) , [ scoza ] where @xmath40 is the nearest neighbor sum , ( * k * ) = ,  , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are functions of @xmath43 .",
    "( [ scoza ] ) is the oz ansatz applied to the lattice gas .",
    "the msa is the special case obtained by setting @xmath44 and adjusting @xmath41 to be compatible with the core condition that assigns zero probability to multiple occupancy of a single site . in scoza one",
    "instead adjusts @xmath42 to insure self consistency between eq .",
    "( [ chi1 ] ) and  ( [ energy ] ) .",
    "the core condition @xmath45 implies a relation between @xmath41 and @xmath42 through the oz equation : 1-&= & + & = & + & & , [ core ] where @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 is the value for the lattice green function @xmath48 at @xmath49 .",
    "for a two - dimensional square lattice we have p(z ) = _ 0^ = k(z ) , where @xmath50 is the complete elliptic integral of the first kind . from eq .",
    "( [ core ] ) we have c_0 = , and c_1 = . by taking @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ oz ] ) , we get -1=h(0)=c_0-c_0 + qc_1 h_1 , so h_1 = -[1+(1-)c_0 ] = - .    after substitutions",
    "( [ chi1 ] ) and ( [ energy ] ) become ^-1 = [ chi2 ] and u = -12 q ( - ( 1- ) ) . from eq .",
    "( [ chi2 ] ) we conclude that in scoza the criticality , if any , occurs at @xmath52 , since at the critical point one has @xmath53 , and we have @xmath54 for all @xmath55 .    finally , by applying the thermodynamic consistency via eq .",
    "( [ consistency ] ) , we get the scoza partial differential equation : [ ( 1-z)p(z ) ] = - - q .",
    "the boundary conditions are @xmath56 , i.e. , @xmath57 , at @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "since for the two - dimensional square lattice @xmath47 diverges when @xmath60 , the renormalized inverse temperature parameter @xmath42 also diverges . as a result",
    ", scoza fails to predict a true critical point above zero temperature in this case .",
    "nevertheless , the scoza results for @xmath29 match the exact onsager expression@xcite for @xmath29 remarkably well over the whole temperature range . instead of having an infinite slope at the exact critical temperature , the scoza slope achieves its maximum at a temperature within a fraction of a percent of the exact value .",
    "the nonsingular but near - singular behavior near the ideal transition temperature makes our results strikingly similar to the exact results for a finite - size ising model on a square lattice , @xmath22@xcite , or a finite - width strip , @xmath61@xcite , for an @xmath21 a bit greater than 20 .    in fig .  1 we plot the negative internal energy @xmath62 versus the inverse temperature @xmath63 along the critical isochore @xmath64 , i.e. , magnetization being equal to 0 , for the comparison between scoza and both infinite- and finite - size ising exact results .",
    "the comparison is made even clearer by plotting their residuals in fig .",
    "we find that the deviations between scoza and the other results are very small over the whole temperature range .",
    "the deviations get larger near the critical point @xmath65 , although the largest deviation is still within 3 percent . comparing with finite - size and finite - width exact results",
    ", we find this deviation gets minimized when we choose @xmath66 for an @xmath22 ising model or @xmath67 for an @xmath23 ising model .    in fig .",
    "3 we plot the specific heat versus @xmath63 along the critical isochore .",
    "the scoza result has a specific heat that stays finite at its maximum , as all the finite - size and finite - width specific heats do in an exact theory . in this comparison",
    "we again find that the scoza infinite - lattice result has great resemblance to the @xmath68 or @xmath69 ising model .",
    "the scoza curve matches well with the @xmath69 ising model for @xmath70 .",
    "but for @xmath71 the scoza result has somewhat less difference to the @xmath68 solution .",
    "the maximum of scoza curve occurs at @xmath72 , whereas the exact critical point for the infinite ising model is @xmath73 .",
    "the maximum for the @xmath68 and @xmath69 ising models occur at @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively . the deviations between these maximum temperatures and the exact critical temperature is of the same order for the scoza and @xmath76 results , whereas it is a bit larger for the @xmath68 case .",
    "in this regard the scoza is a bit more similar to the @xmath69 model .    for each fixed value of @xmath32",
    ", we define the temperature where the specific heat is at its maximum as the pseudo singular temperature . here",
    "we try to determine a pseudo spinodal curve by collecting the set of @xmath77 points that correspond to those pseudo singularities .",
    "this pseudo spinodal curve is shown in fig .",
    "note that the points on the curve do nt mark real singularities , and both the specific heat and the compressibility remain finite , but very large , at these points .",
    "furthermore , near the pseudo critical point @xmath78 , by defining @xmath79 , @xmath80 , we find ~(t)^_spinodal , with a classical exponent @xmath81 when @xmath82 .    from eqs .",
    "( [ fourier ] ) and ( [ scoza ] ) we find that in scoza the function @xmath83 has a form proportional to the fourier transform of the lattice green function @xmath84 .",
    "hence we have @xmath85 . from the fact that h(*r * ) ~p(z,*r * ) ~(-2r )",
    "when @xmath86@xcite , we find in scoza the correlation length = 12 . in fig .",
    "5 we plot the correlation length @xmath87 versus temperature at the critical isochore . since for the two - dimensional scoza scheme @xmath60 only when @xmath88 , the correlation length keeps finite at the exact critical temperature @xmath5 and only diverges when @xmath89 .",
    "however , when @xmath90 we have @xmath91 according to the scoza scheme , which already indicates strong correlations . furthermore , the correlation length increases sharply right below @xmath90 .      99 hye  j  s and stell  g 1977 _ j. chem phys . _ * 67 * 439 ; ibid 1977 _ mol .",
