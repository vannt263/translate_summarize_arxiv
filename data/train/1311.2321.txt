    "network coding ( nc ) @xcite refers to mixing different information flows at the sender or intermediate nodes in a data communication network .",
    "it has been shown that nc can substantially improve the throughput of many wireless communication systems @xcite . as a result",
    ", it has become a promising candidate for delivering high data rate content in future wireless communication networks .",
    "for example , nc has been considered for delivering high data rate multimedia broadcast or multicast services ( mbms ) @xcite .",
    "in addition to being high data rate in nature , such applications also often have strict delay requirements",
    ". however , the higher throughput offered by nc does not necessarily translate into faster delivery of information to the application @xcite .",
    "in general , the mixed information needs to be disentangled or network decoded first . understanding the interplay between throughput and delay and devising nc schemes that strike a balance between the two are particularly important , which has proven to be challenging @xcite .",
    "an important example that illustrates the tension between throughput and delay is random linear network coding ( rlnc ) @xcite in broadcast erasure channels . in rlnc , the sender combines a frame or block of @xmath0 packets using random coefficients from a finite field and broadcasts different combinations until all receivers have received @xmath0 linearly independent coded packets . in this case",
    ", rlnc achieves the best throughput ( block completion time ) among block - based nc schemes @xcite .",
    "however , the delay performance may not be desirable , as decoding at the receivers is generally only possible after @xmath0 independent coded packets are successfully received .    in order to reduce the decoding delay in nc systems ,",
    "an attractive strategy is to employ instantly decodable nc ( idnc ) .",
    "as the name suggests , idnc aims to provide instant packet decoding at the receivers upon successful packet reception , a property that rlnc does not guarantee .",
    "a decoding delay occurs at a receiver when it is not targeted in an idnc transmission .",
    "that is , it receives a packet that contains either no or more than one desired packets of that receiver . compared to rlnc , idnc in broadcast erasure channels can have a lower throughput .",
    "in other words , idnc incurs a generally higher completion time for the broadcast of the same number of @xmath0 packets .",
    "however , it can provide a faster delivery of uncoded packets to the application layer , as required for mbms .",
    "therefore , similar tension between throughput and delay can also be observed in idnc .",
    "inspired by the low - complexity xor - based encoding and decoding process of idnc and its potential application in mbms and unicast settings @xcite , in this paper we are interested in understanding the interplay between its throughput and delay over broadcast erasure channels and proposing novel idnc schemes that offer a better control of these performance metrics .",
    "the problem of maximizing the throughput for a deadline - constrained video - streaming scenario is considered in @xcite , where each packet has a delivery deadline and has to be decoded before the deadline , otherwise it is expired . in this paper , however , we consider a block - based transmission , where all the packets in the block have to be received by all the receivers and there is no explicit packet deadline .",
    "furthermore , in this paper , no new packet arrival is considered in the system while the transmission of a block is in progress .",
    "in addition , this study is applicable where partial decoding is beneficial and can result in lower delays irrespective of the order in which packets are being decoded .",
    "examples of such applications can be found in sensor or emergency networks and multiple - description source coded systems @xcite , in which every decoded packet brings new information to the destination , irrespective of its order .    in this context ,",
    "the closest works to ours are @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in particular , the authors in @xcite aimed to improve the decoding delay of a generalized idnc scheme .",
    "they showed that for a lower decoding delay , maximum number of receivers with the lowest packet erasure probabilities should be targeted in each idnc transmission .",
    "in separate works @xcite , the same authors aimed to improve the completion time of idnc .",
    "they showed that for this purpose , the receivers with the maximum number of missing packets with the highest erasure probabilities should be targeted in each idnc transmission .",
    "a close study of @xcite reveals that trying to improve either idnc s decoding delay or completion time on its own can result in undermining the other performance metric .",
    "in other words , while trying to improve the decoding delay , the receiver(s ) with the maximum number of missing packets may remain untargeted , which can increase the completion time . also trying to improve the completion time",
    "may limit the total number of receivers that can be targeted in each idnc transmission , which can increase the decoding delay . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there is no joint control of completion time and decoding delay for idnc schemes in the literature .",
    "thus , in this paper , our objective is to take a holistic approach , in which the completion time and decoding delay of idnc are taken into account at the same time .",
    "in addition , we have observed that the decoding delay across various receivers in idnc schemes of @xcite and @xcite can vary significantly .",
    "this may not be desirable in mbms or other applications which should guarantee a certain quality of service across all receivers .",
    "these observations lead us to the following open problems :    _ is there an idnc scheme that can offer a balanced performance in terms of the completion time and decoding delay and can also provide a more uniform or fair decoding delay across all receivers for the broadcast of @xmath0 packets in erasure channels ? _    to address these questions in this paper , we propose a new idnc transmission scheme which builds upon the contributions in @xcite and @xcite . at its core",
    ", our proposed scheme recognizes that 1 ) the completion time of each individual receiver is determined not only by the number of packets it is missing , but also by the number of idnc transmissions in which it is not targeted ( while still needing a packet(s ) ) and 2 ) the overall idnc completion time is the maximum of individual completion times .",
    "therefore , our idnc transmission scheme gives priority to the receivers that have the highest expected completion time so far .",
    "more precisely , the priority of each receiver is the sum of two terms : the first term is its number of missing packets divided by its average packet reception probability .",
    "this is the expected number of transmissions to serve this receiver if it is targeted in all following transmissions .",
    "the second term is the decoding delay the receiver has experienced so far . under this scheme",
    ", a receiver with a small number of missing packets which has remained untargeted in a number of previous transmissions may take precedence over other receivers .",
    "hence , our scheme tends to equalize the decoding delay experience across the receivers .",
    "furthermore , we will extend our proposed scheme to the case of broadcast erasure channels with memory @xcite , where the packet erasures occur in bursts , due to deep fading and shadowing . by following the proposed channel models in @xcite",
    ", we model the bursts of erasures ( i.e. the memory of the channel ) by a simple two - state gilbert - elliott channel ( gec ) model and propose two algorithms that can offer an improved balance between the completion time and decoding delay of idnc for different ranges of the channel memory .    with this introduction ,",
    "we summarize the contributions and findings of our paper as follows : first , we present a holistic viewpoint of idnc .",
    "we formulate the idnc optimal packet selection that provides an improved balance between the completion time and decoding delay for broadcast transmission over memoryless channels as an ssp problem . however , since finding the optimal packet selection in the proposed ssp scheme is computationally complex , we use the ssp formulation and its geometric structure to find some guidelines that can be used to propose a new heuristic packet selection algorithm that efficiently improves the balance between the completion time and decoding delay in idnc systems .",
    "second , we extend the proposed packet selection algorithm to erasure channels with memory and propose two different variations of the algorithm that take into account the channel memory conditions and improve the balance between the completion time and decoding delay by selecting the packet combinations more effectively based on the channel memory conditions compared to the algorithms that are ignorant to the channel memory . finally , by taking into account both the number of missing packets and the decoding delay of the receivers , the proposed algorithm provides a more uniform decoding delay experience across all receivers .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "the system model is presented in section ii .",
    "the idnc graph representation and packet generation is introduced in section iii .",
    "section iv , presents the ssp problem formulation . in section",
    "v , we present a geometric structure for the ssp problem that helps us to find the properties of the optimal packet selection policy . a heuristic algorithm for idnc packet selection is proposed in section vi .",
    "the proposed heuristic algorithm is then extended to erasure channels with memory in section vii , where also a new layered algorithm is introduced .",
    "section viii presents the simulation results .",
    "finally , section ix concludes the paper .",
    "the system model consists of a wireless sender that is required to deliver a block ( denoted by @xmath1 ) of @xmath0 source packets to a set ( denoted by @xmath2 ) of @xmath3 receivers .",
    "each receiver is interested in receiving all the packets of @xmath1 .",
    "the sender initially transmits the @xmath0 packets of the block uncoded in an _ initial transmission phase_. each sent packet is subject to erasure at receiver @xmath4 with the probability @xmath5 , which is assumed to be fixed during a block transmission period .",
    "each receiver listens to all transmitted packets and feeds back a positive or negative acknowledgment ( ack or nak ) for each received or lost packet . at the end of the initial transmission phase ,",
    "two `` feedback sets '' can be attributed to each receiver",
    "@xmath4 :    1 .",
    "the has set ( denoted by @xmath6 ) is defined as the set of packets correctly received by receiver @xmath4 .",
    "2 .   the wants set ( denoted by @xmath7 ) is defined as the set of packets that are missed at receiver @xmath4 in the initial transmission phase of the current block . in other words",
    "@xmath8 .",
    "the senders then stores this information in the _ state feedback matrix _ ( sfm )",
    "@xmath9 , \\forall i \\in \\mathcal",
    "m , j\\in \\mathcal n$ ] as : @xmath10    after the initial transmission phase , a _ recovery transmission phase _ starts , in which the sender exploits the diversity of received and lost packets to transmit network coded combinations of the source packets . note that we denote the wants and has sets of receiver @xmath4 at the start of the recovery transmission phase by @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively . after each transmission , for each received / lost packet , the receivers send ack / nak to the sender .",
    "this information is then used by the sender to update the sfm .",
    "this process is repeated until all receivers obtain all packets .",
    "similar two - phase transmission schemes have been widely considered in the literature for idnc schemes @xcite .",
    "based on the wants and has sets information , in the recovery transmission phase , the transmitted coded packets can be one of the following options for each receiver",
    "@xmath4 :    1 .",
    "non - innovative packet : a packet is non - innovative for receiver @xmath4 if it contains no source packets from @xmath7 .",
    "2 .   instantly decodable packet : a packet is instantly decodable for receiver @xmath4 if it contains only one source packet from @xmath7 .",
    "the set of receivers for which the transmitted packet is instantly decodable packet are referred to as the _",
    "targeted receivers_. 3 .",
    "non - instantly decodable packet : a packet is non - instantly decodable for receiver @xmath4 if it contains two or more source packets from @xmath7 .",
    "we define the completion time and decoding delay similar to @xcite as follows :    it should be noted that if receiver @xmath4 is targeted by one of its missing packets in all transmissions , in the absence of packet erasures , @xmath13 will be equal to the size of its wants set at the start of the recovery transmission phase , i.e. @xmath14 .",
    "in this paper , we adopt idnc @xcite as our nc transmission scheme .",
    "idnc allows the sender to transmit a coded packet that includes at most one source packet from the wants sets of the targeted receivers ( either an appropriately selected subset or if possible all receivers ) .",
    "thus , at the targeted receivers , the packet is instantly decodable .",
    "however , at the rest of the receivers ( referred to as _ untargeted receivers _ ) , the packet is either non - innovative or non - instantly decodable , if successfully received .",
    "thus , the untargeted receivers will experience one unit increase of their accumulative decoding delay .",
    "we start this section by first exploring all possible packet combinations that are instantly decodable by any subset or if possible all receivers .",
    "all the feasible packet combinations can be represented in the form of a graph model , which was first used in the context of idnc in @xcite .",
    "then , we will briefly review the packet selection schemes in @xcite and @xcite that were used to separately minimize idnc s oct and decoding delay , respectively .    as presented in @xcite , the idnc graph @xmath15",
    "is constructed by first inducing a vertex @xmath16 for each packet @xmath17 . in other words ,",
    "any vertex @xmath18 represents a wanted packet @xmath19 for receiver @xmath4 .",
    "two vertices @xmath18 and @xmath20 in @xmath21 are connected by an edge @xmath22 if any one of the following conditions is true :    * c1 : * @xmath23 the two vertices are induced by the loss of the same packet @xmath19 by two different receivers @xmath4 and @xmath24 .",
    "an edge generated by this condition does not involve any combination , but expresses the interest of the two receivers in the same packet .    *",
    "c2 : * @xmath25 the wanted packet corresponding to each vertex is in the has set of the receiver of the other vertex .",
    "an edge generated by c2 represents a possible combination of packets @xmath19 and @xmath26 of the form @xmath27 that will be instantly decodable for receivers @xmath4 and @xmath24 .",
    "given the graph formulation , the set of all feasible packet combinations in idnc can be expressed as the set of packet combinations defined by all maximal cliques in @xmath28 ( a _ maximal clique _ is a clique that is not a subset of any larger clique ) .",
    "consequently , the sender can generate an idnc packet for a given transmission by xoring all the packets identified by the vertices of a selected maximal clique in @xmath28 . assuming that @xmath29 is the selected maximal clique in @xmath28 , the targeted receivers of this clique are represented by @xmath30 .",
    "the problem of minimizing the oct of the idnc scheme for broadcast erasure channels has been studied in @xcite where it is shown that the expected ict for receiver @xmath4 , denoted by @xmath31 , if addressed in all future transmissions , can be expressed as @xmath32 .",
    "having the expected ict of all receivers calculated , it is shown in @xcite that an efficient policy for reducing the oct should select maximal cliques that include the maximum number of vertices belonging to receivers having the largest @xmath31 . in order to simplify such maximal cliques selection in the idnc graph @xmath28 ,",
    "the authors in @xcite proposed a maximum weight vertex search algorithm , where the weights of vertices in @xmath33 reflect the properties of their inducing receivers as follows .",
    "let us define @xmath34 to be the adjacency indicator of vertices @xmath18 and @xmath20 in idnc graph @xmath33 such that : @xmath35 given the adjacency indicator , the weighted degree @xmath36 of vertex @xmath18 in @xcite is defined as @xmath37 .",
    "thus , the weight of vertex @xmath38 can be defined as @xmath39 .",
    "this expression means that a vertex has a large weight when it both belongs to a receiver with large @xmath31 value and is connected to a large number of vertices having large @xmath40 values .",
    "the problem of minimizing the decoding delay of idnc scheme for broadcast erasure channels has been studied in @xcite where it is shown that an efficient policy for reducing decoding delay is selecting maximal cliques that include the maximum number of vertices belonging to receivers having high reception probabilities that are also connected to vertices with large reception probabilities ( i.e. low erasure probabilities ) .",
    "thus , the weight of vertex @xmath18 , @xmath41 , in @xcite is defined as @xmath42 , where @xmath36 reflects the connection of vertex @xmath18 to vertices having large reception probabilities and is defined in @xcite as @xmath43 .    unlike @xcite and @xcite , in this study ,",
    "our goal is to propose a new packet selection policy that can provide joint control of the oct and decoding delay for idnc schemes .",
    "in this section , we present a holistic viewpoint of idnc schemes in which the completion time and decoding delay are taken into account at the same time . by taking this viewpoint , we introduce a new idnc scheme that offers an improved balance between the oct and decoding delay performances , and at the same time provides a more uniform decoding delay experience across all receivers for the broadcast of @xmath0 packets .",
    "the key idea here is that the ict of each receiver is not only determined by the number of its missing packets , but also the decoding delay that the respective receiver experiences .",
    "furthermore , we note that the oct of the idnc transmission is equal to the maximum of icts",
    ". we will use this relationship between the oct and decoding delay to design an idnc scheme that provides a balance between these two performance metrics .",
    "the proposed scheme is then solved as an ssp problem .    here , we first define @xmath44 $ ] and @xmath45 $ ] as the wants and has vectors , such that @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the cardinalities of wants and has sets at the start of recovery phase , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , @xmath48 $ ] is defined as the final accumulative decoding delay vector , where @xmath49 is the final accumulative decoding delay experienced by receiver @xmath4 ( i.e. the accumulative decoding delay experienced by receiver @xmath4 until it receives all its missing packets ) .",
    "the best possible performance of idnc in terms of the oct and decoding delay can be achieved if in every single transmission all the receivers with non - empty wants sets are targeted . in this case , after each transmission , assuming that no erasure occurs , the remaining number of transmissions is reduced by one and the accumulative decoding delays experienced by the receivers are zero . under this scenario ,",
    "the ict of each receiver is equal to the size of its initial wants set , @xmath46 , and the oct of the system is equal to the maximum ict of the receivers ( the size of the largest initial wants set , i.e. @xmath50 ) .",
    "furthermore @xmath51 .    however ,",
    "since it is not always possible to target all the receivers with non - empty wants sets in every single transmission , due to instant decodability constraint , the receivers that are not targeted will experience a decoding delay , and thus , their icts will be increased by the value of their final accumulative decoding delay ( i.e. the total number of the time - slots that they were not targeted ) . therefore , we can write the ict of receiver @xmath4 , denoted by @xmath13 , as @xmath52    as shown in , the ict of each receiver depends on the size of its initial wants set , @xmath46 , and the final accumulative decoding delay it experiences , @xmath49 .",
    "having defined the receivers icts , it can be easily inferred that oct of the system is equal to the maximum ict of the receivers , and can be expressed as @xmath53    it is worth noting that based on , minimizing the decoding delay of receiver @xmath4 is equivalent to minimizing its ict .",
    "furthermore , based on , minimizing the oct is equivalent to minimizing the largest icts .",
    "therefore , the problem of providing a balance between the decoding delay and oct can be translated into balancing between @xmath54 and @xmath55 of the receivers .    in the next section",
    ", we will show that the packet selection problem that offers such balance between the oct and decoding delay of the receivers for the idnc can be formulated in the form of an ssp problem .",
    "the ssp problem is a special case of an infinite horizon markov decision process , which can model decision based stochastic dynamic systems with a terminating state .",
    "ssp problem was first used in the context of idnc in @xcite in order to select the packet combinations that result in minimum completion time . in ssp problem",
    ", different possible situations that the system could encounter are modeled as states @xmath56 ( where @xmath57 denotes the state space of the ssp problem ) . in each state @xmath56 , the system must select an action @xmath58 from an action space @xmath59 that will charge it an immediate cost @xmath60 ( @xmath61 denotes the action space of the ssp problem ) . in the general form ,",
    "the cost of a transition from state @xmath62 to state @xmath63 is modelled as a scalar that depends on @xmath62 , the taken action @xmath58 , and @xmath63 . under this scenario , in the ssp formulation , the expected cost @xmath64 is calculated as @xmath65 , where @xmath66 represents the probability of system moving from state @xmath62 to state @xmath63 once action @xmath58 is taken .",
    "the terminating condition of the system can be thus represented as a zero - cost _ absorbing goal state_. an ssp policy @xmath67 $ ] is a mapping from @xmath68 that associates a given action to each of the states .",
    "the optimal policy @xmath69 of an ssp problem is the one that minimizes the cumulative mean cost until the goal state is reached .",
    "the algorithms solving ssp problems define a value function @xmath70 as the expected cumulative cost until absorption , when the system starts at state @xmath62 and follows policy @xmath71 .",
    "it can be recursively expressed for all @xmath56 as : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the set of successor states to @xmath62 when action @xmath58 is taken ( i.e. @xmath74 ) consequently , the optimal policy at state @xmath62 can be defined for all @xmath56 as : @xmath75      in order to express the packet selection problem that improves the balance between the oct and decoding delay of the system for idnc in the form of an ssp problem , we need to define the following :      each state @xmath62 can be characterized by its has , wants and the accumulative decoding delay vectors , @xmath76 $ ] , @xmath77 $ ] and @xmath78 $ ] , respectively .",
    "the values of @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 at the starting state of the recovery transmission phase , @xmath82 , are represented by @xmath83 $ ] , @xmath84 $ ] and @xmath85 $ ] , respectively , where @xmath86 and @xmath87 , @xmath88 .",
    "furthermore , we define the absorbing state , @xmath89 , as the state in which all the receivers receive all their missing packets . in other words , the absorbing state is the final state of the recovery transmission phase in which @xmath90 $ ] .",
    "in addition , for each state @xmath62 , we define @xmath91 to be the set of receivers who still need one or more packets .",
    "it is worth noting that the value of the accumulative decoding delay vector at the absorbing state ; i.e. @xmath92 $ ] where @xmath93 , @xmath88 ; depends on the taken actions in all states prior to reaching the absorbing state .      for each state @xmath62 ,",
    "the action space @xmath94 consists of all possible maximal cliques in graph @xmath95 constructed from the sfm @xmath96 in state @xmath62 .",
    "defining @xmath97 as the set of maximal cliques in @xmath95 , the cardinality of state @xmath62 action space , i.e. @xmath98 , is equal to @xmath99 .",
    "considering the fact that each state @xmath62 can be efficiently represented by the wants sets and accumulative decoding delays of all receivers , here , we further define the _ state value _",
    "@xmath100 for receiver @xmath4 as @xmath101 in a more general framework , this equation can be written as @xmath102 where the weight @xmath103 can be designed for more control over oct or decoding delay according to the system requirements . in the rest of this paper",
    ", we assign equal weights to @xmath104 and @xmath105 , and consider the state value of receiver @xmath4 to be of the form @xmath106 , except stated otherwise .",
    "furthermore , the _ state vector _ for all receivers is defined as @xmath107 $ ] .",
    "now , the state - action transition probability @xmath66 for an action @xmath108 , can be defined based on the possibilities of the variations in @xmath100 from state @xmath62 to state @xmath63 .    to define @xmath66 , here ,",
    "we first introduce the following three sets : @xmath109 @xmath110 @xmath111 where @xmath91 denotes all the receivers with non - empty wants sets at state @xmath62 and @xmath112 represents the set of all the targeted receivers in the maximal clique @xmath113 . here , the first set consists of the receivers who have been targeted by the clique @xmath113 and their @xmath100 have been decreased from state @xmath62 to state @xmath63 .",
    "this means that these receivers have successfully received an idnc packet , which addressed them by one of their missing packets .",
    "thus , the size of their wants sets is reduced and their accumulative decoding delays are remained unchanged .",
    "the second set includes the receivers who have not been targeted but have successfully received the transmitted packet . in this case",
    "@xmath100 is increased from state @xmath62 to state @xmath63 , since the wants sets of these receivers have remained unchanged and their accumulative decoding delays have increased due to successfully receiving either a non - innovative or a non - instantly decodable packet .",
    "the third set includes the receivers who have not received any packet due to packet erasure and as a result , their wants sets and accumulative decoding delays have remained unchanged , thus @xmath114 .",
    "based on the definitions of these three sets , @xmath66 can be expressed as follows : @xmath115     of the example sfm in , title=\"fig : \" ]   of the example sfm in , title=\"fig : \" ]      the best possible action is the action that addresses all the receivers with non - empty wants sets at state @xmath62 , denoted by @xmath91 , by one of their missing packets . under this scenario , assuming no erasure occurs , the wants sets of all the receivers are reduced from state @xmath62 to state @xmath63 and their accumulative decoding delays remain unchanged ( i.e. @xmath116 and @xmath117 ) . in this case , for each receiver @xmath4 we will have @xmath118 .",
    "this is the best performance that can be achieved for an idnc scheme .    knowing that any transition ( due to any action ) takes one packet transmission , the cost of action @xmath58 on each receiver",
    "@xmath4 can be defined as @xmath119 .",
    "this results in three possible cost values , i.e. @xmath120 , associated with action @xmath58 on receiver @xmath4 that can be expressed as follows :    * @xmath121 means that action @xmath58 does not incur any cost on receiver @xmath4 in terms of its wants set and accumulative decoding delay , if it successfully receives one of its missing packets . in this case ,",
    "@xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "* @xmath124 means that receiver @xmath4 ( targeted / untargeted ) did not receive the coded packet due to packet erasure . in this case",
    ", there is no cost on the accumulative decoding delay , however , the wants set of receiver @xmath4 remains unchanged , as no missing packet was decoded . here",
    ", at least one more time - slot ( one transmission ) is required to be able to reduce the size of receiver @xmath4 s wants set . under this scenario , @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "* @xmath127 means that receiver @xmath4 was not targeted by action @xmath58 and has successfully received either a non - instantly decodable or a non - innovative packet . in this case , there are costs on both the accumulative decoding delay and wants set of receiver @xmath4 , as it experiences an increase in its accumulative decoding delay and the size of its wants set remains unchanged .",
    "as a result @xmath128 and @xmath129 .    based on the above discussion ,",
    "if receiver @xmath4 is targeted by action @xmath58 , i.e. @xmath130 , the cost will be @xmath131 @xmath132 thus , the expected cost given receiver @xmath4 is targeted by action @xmath58 can be calculated as @xmath133 however , if receiver @xmath4 is not targeted by action @xmath58 , i.e. @xmath134 , the cost will be @xmath135 @xmath136 thus , the expected cost given receiver @xmath4 is not targeted by action @xmath58 can be calculated as @xmath137 the total expected cost of action @xmath58 over all the receivers in @xmath91 can thus be defined as @xmath138 @xmath139      the optimal policy as presented in section  [ ssp_problem ] can be expressed as @xmath140\\}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath141 is the expectation operator over different transmission probabilities when action @xmath58 is taken .",
    "thus , the optimal action at state @xmath62 is the action that minimizes the cost as well as the expectation of the optimal value functions of the successor states .",
    "however , solving this ssp problem is computationally complex and requires exhaustive iterative techniques @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is no closed - form solution to this problem .",
    "thus , instead of solving the ssp problem formulated in , we can study its properties and structure to draw the characteristics of the optimal policy . to this end , we will study the geometric structure of the ssp solution in the context of the proposed idnc scheme .",
    "in other words , our aim of the ssp formulation is not to use it as a solution , but to study its properties by the help of its geometric structure and find some guidelines for policies that can improve the balance between the oct and decoding delay in idnc systems .",
    "we then use these policies to design simple yet efficient heuristic algorithms in section  [ sec : heuristicalg ] .",
    "in order to find some guidelines for the policies that can efficiently improve the balance between the oct and decoding delay in idnc systems , in this section , we study the geometric structure of the ssp problem . given the representation of the ssp problem in each state @xmath62 by the state vector of the receivers @xmath107 $ ] , we can now explain the geometric structure of the problem as follows .",
    "first , we consider an @xmath3-dimensional cartesian space , and assign to each point @xmath142 $ ] in this space all the states that have the state vectors @xmath107 $ ] equal to the coordination of this point .",
    "although many states can have the same state vector , these states differ from one another by their sfms .",
    "the absorbing state is the state for which all @xmath143 . under the special scenario where the accumulative decoding delays are zero , i.e. @xmath144",
    ", the absorbing state is located in the origin of the considered @xmath3-dimensional cartesian space . however , in general , the decoding delays experienced by the receivers until arriving at the absorbing state can be non - zero positive integers , and consequently the absorbing point will not necessarily be located in the origin of the space .",
    "after each transmission , if the packet is successfully received at a receiver , there are two possibilities , 1 ) it is instantly decodable , and thus @xmath145 , 2 ) it is either non - instantly decodable or non - innovative , and thus @xmath146 . however , if the packet is not received at the receiver , then @xmath114 .",
    "therefore , it can be easily concluded that the system can at most move from point @xmath147 to another point @xmath148 which is a vertex in the hypercube @xmath149 defined as : @xmath150 in other words , @xmath149 is the hypercube of side length 1 , in which @xmath151 and @xmath152 are two of the corners .    here , we start with the geometric structure of the ssp problem in the erasure - free case and then extend it to the case with erasures .",
    "in the erasure - free case , since transmitted packets are always successfully received by the receivers , depending on the received packet being instantly decodable or not , we will have @xmath145 or @xmath146 . under this scenario ,",
    "@xmath151 and @xmath152 are always two diagonal corners in the hypercube @xmath149 , i.e. @xmath153 .      under the erasure - free scenario , it can be shown that at any state @xmath62 choosing the action that transitions the system to the opposite diagonal point in the @xmath154-dimensional hypercube , for which @xmath122 and thus @xmath155 , would not adversely affect the optimality of future decisions .",
    "this is due to the fact that all packets in this action will be received by all receivers and therefore , they would not contribute to any future cost .",
    "[ exm : subcase1 ] however , such zero - cost actions do not always exist in most states , due to the instant decodability constraint .",
    "consequently , we need a method to find efficient actions that provide an improved balance between the oct and decoding delay .      in the absence of an action with zero total cost , in order to find efficient actions that provide an improved balance between the oct and decoding delay , we consider the geometric structure in the following example .",
    "[ exm : subcase2 ]    it is worth noting that in the above example , the @xmath156 norm ( euclidian distance ) is used to represent a state s closeness to the origin .",
    "the above discussion can be summarized as the following remark . [",
    "remark : guidelines ]    furthermore , it can also be easily inferred that having higher priorities for receivers with larger values of @xmath106 can potentially result in a lower variance of the decoding delay experienced by the receivers in the system .",
    "it means that when the decoding delay of a receiver increases , the value of @xmath100 also increases , and as a result of that the respective receiver will be given a higher priority .",
    "this can also be translated into improving the decoding delay fairness among the receivers while minimizing the oct of the system .",
    "the simulation results on the variance of the decoding delay across all receivers are represented in section  [ sec : results ] .      due to the nature of wireless broadcast systems and the fact that the sfm changes probabilistically after each transmission as a result of packet erasures , in this paper , we design the idnc packet dynamically according to the received feedback in each time slot . under this scenario , since the packet erasures are not known ahead of time , our approach is a greedy - based algorithm in which at each transmission based on the updated sfm , a single coded packet is designed ( guided by remark 2 above ) .",
    "it is worth noting that this greedy scheme does not necessarily result in a globally optimal policy stated in .    for erasure channels , the effect of packet erasures",

    "consequently , receiver @xmath4 will require on average more targeting attempts compared to receiver @xmath24 in order to deplete its wants set .",
    "since we assume that erasure probabilities do not change during the transmission of a block , targeting receiver @xmath24 and ignoring receiver @xmath4 is expected to result in a higher oct , especially when @xmath158 is among the largest values in @xmath159 . according to these facts and the above discussion in subcase 2 , receiver @xmath4",

    "in this section , we propose a greedy algorithm to select the clique according to the findings in the previous section .",

    "the proposed algorithm performs clique selection , using a maximum weight vertex search approach . for this search to be efficient in finding maximal cliques",

    "based on the above weight definition , we introduce our proposed packet selection algorithm as follows . in each state @xmath62 ,",
    "the algorithm starts by selecting the vertex with the maximum weight , denoted by @xmath179 , and adds it to the clique @xmath180 .",

    "when the channel is in the good state packets can be successfully received , and when the channel is in the bad state packets are lost ( e.g. , due to deep fades in the channel ) .",
