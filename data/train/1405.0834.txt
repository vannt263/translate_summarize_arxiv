    "an interesting problem with practical applications , is to study the validity of the central limit theorem for fourier transform and the periodogram for a markov chain with stationary transitions which is not started from equilibrium but rather started from a point for almost all starting points .",
    "this is often the case for simulated data and also for evolutions in random media or particle systems .",
    "the problem is difficult , since the markov chain started at a point is no longer stationary .",
    "this type of central limit theorem , started at a point , is known under the name of quenched central limit theorem ( clt ) and it is a consequence of a more general result , the almost sure conditional clt for stationary processes .",
    "this means that on a set of measure one the central limit theorem holds when , in the definition of weak convergence , we replace the usual expectation by the conditional expectation with respect to the past @xmath21-algebra .",
    "the almost sure conditional clt implies clt . some examples of stationary processes satisfying the clt but not the almost sure conditional clt can be found in voln and woodroofe @xcite .",
    "the problem of the quenched clt for stationary markov chains or for stationary processes is a subject of intense research .",
    "we mention the papers @xcite , among many others .",
    "several of these results were surveyed in @xcite .",
    "as far as we know , this type of convergence was not yet investigated for the fourier transforms or the periodograms . in this paper , we show that the quenched clt holds for almost all frequencies of the properly centered and normalized discrete fourier transform of any stationary and ergodic sequence .",
    "we also provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the validity of quenched clt without centering and specify a sufficient condition for the validity of quenched clt for fixed frequencies .",
    "all these results shed additional light on the speed of convergence of the periodogram in approximating the spectral density @xmath22 of a stationary process .",
    "the techniques are a nice blend of martingale approximation , rooted in gordin @xcite and rootzn @xcite and developed by gordin and lific @xcite and woodroofe @xcite , and tools from ergodic theory and harmonic analysis .    to allow for flexibility in applications , we introduce a stationary sequence and a filtration in two different ways .",
    "first by using a measure preserving transformation , and then , in section  [ s3 ] , as a function of a markov chain .",
    "we formulate the main results for measure preserving transformations in terms of almost sure conditional clt .",
    "however , in section  [ s3 ] we show that , only by a change of language , the results can be formulated for stationary and ergodic markov chains , where the terminology of a process started at a point becomes natural .    a variety of applications to functions of linear processes , functions of markov chains ,",
    "iterated random functions , mixing sequences , are also pointed out .",
    "it is remarkable that for the case of a stationary ergodic reversible markov chain the quenched clt without centering holds without any other additional assumptions .",
