    "this so - called radiative feedback from the first stars is of considerable cosmological interest .",
    "it can not only self - regulate the first star formation , but also affect the formation and evolution of proto - galaxies .",
    "theories based on cold dark matter ( cdm ) predict that the first cosmological objects form when small mass ( @xmath9 ) dark halos assemble at redshifts @xmath10 ( couchman & rees 1986 ; tegmark et al .",

    "stars formed in these pre - galactic objects may have substantially contributed to cosmic reionization .",
    "recent measurement of the large thomson optical depth by the wmap satellite indicates that the universe was reionized at an epoch as early as @xmath11 ( kogut et al .",
    "2003 ; spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) , supporting the above notion that the first generation stars formed at @xmath12 . theoretical studies of the processes of cosmic reionization by stellar sources suggest that reionization proceeds first by the formation of individual hii regions around radiation sources ( galaxies ) , and then by percolation of the growing hii bubbles ( gnedin & ostriker 1997 ; ricotti et al .",
    "2002 ; sokasian et al .",
    "the shape and the extension of the individual hii regions critically determine the global topology of the ionized regions in a cosmological volume at different epochs during reionization .",
    "studies on the formation of hii regions in dense gas clouds date back to the seminal work by strmgren ( 1939 ) .",
    "since then the structure of hii regions and the interaction with the surrounding medium have been extensively studied ( see yorke 1986 for a review ) .",
    "an important advance has been made by franco , tenorio - tagle & bodenheimer ( 1990 ) who considered realistic conditions in which the initial gas density profile is given by a power - law .",
    "franco et al . showed that a hydrodynamic shock effectively sweeps the ambient medium into a thin shell and the gas density profile is significantly modified from the initial power - law shape .",
    "shu et al .",
    "( 2002 ) obtained the self - similar solutions for the expansion of self - gravitating hii regions . on cosmological backgrounds ,",
    "shapiro & giroux ( 1987 ) studied the evolution of the cosmological strmgren sphere around luminous quasars in an expanding universe .",
    "ricotti & shull ( 2000 ) computed the uv photon consumption in small mass halos to estimate the photon escape fraction . their calculations , however , do not include the hydrodynamic response of the photoheated gas and are not adequate to address the dynamical evolution of hii regions .",
    "more recently , whalen , abel & norman ( 2004 ) carried out a numerical simulation of ionization front ( i - front ) propagation starting from a realistic initial density profile for the first star - forming cloud .",
    "whalen et al . found that the escape fraction of ionizing photons is close to unity in a particular case with halo mass @xmath13 at @xmath14 .",
    "it is by no means trivial if such high escape fraction is achieved for different masses and redshifts .",
    "in the present paper , we study the evolution of hii regions around population iii stars for a wide range of halo mass , redshift , and gas density profile .",
    "specifically , we consider an `` inside - out '' situation , where the central source ionizes the surrounding gas and drives a supersonic gas flow outward .",
    "while the overall configuration of our simulations may appear similar to those in conventional studies on hii regions , we have several critical ingredients relevant to the case of early generation star - formation ; 1 ) gravitational force exerted by the host dark matter halo , 2 ) radiation force by the central star , 3 ) radiative transfer of uv photons , 4 ) chemical reactions including formation and destruction of hydrogen molecules , and 5 ) radiative cooling and heating processes , including inverse - compton cooling particularly important at @xmath15 .",
    "our inside - out simulations are complementary to a number of works that focused on radiative feedback from an external field ( umemura & ikeuchi 1984 ; rees 1986 ; bond , szalay & silk 1988 ; efstathiou 1992 ; thoul & weinberg 1996 ; kepner , babul & spergel ; barkana & loeb 1999 ; kitayama & ikeuchi 2000 ; susa & umemura 2000 , 2004 ; kitayama et al . 2000 , 2001 ;",
    "shapiro , iliev & raga 2003 , 2004 ) . while external radiation can easily ionize and blow away the outer envelope of gas clouds , photo - evaporation proceeds less effectively in the densest central part .",
    "shapiro et al . ( 2004 ) indeed show that evaporation of an initially hydrostatic mini - halo ( @xmath9 ) takes about 100 million years when irradiated by a luminous source at a distance of @xmath16 mpc .",
    "at the very center of the halo , self - shielding and dynamical infall of the gas can prevent complete evaporation and promote star formation ( kitayama et al .",
    "2001 ; susa & umemura 2004 ) .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the gas cloud will then be largely regulated by the feedback from the central star . as will be shown in the present paper , ionization of the ambient gas by an internal source",
    "is more rapid than that by the external radiation because of the greater incident radiation flux and the presence of the gas density gradient .",
    "the final state of the ionized gas near the central region is of particular interest in the study of the first supernova explosions ( e.g. bromm , yoshida & hernquist 2003 ; wada & venkatesan 2003 ) .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the ionized gas has also an important implication for the formation of proto - galaxies ( oh & haiman 2003 ) . for the gas clouds hosted by mini - halos with mass @xmath9 , one may naively expect that the gas is completely photoionized and eventually photoevaporated , because the virial temperature of the system is much lower than the characteristic temperature of photoionized gas . on the other hand ,",
    "larger dark matter halos generate a deeper gravitational potential well , and thus it can effectively trap the hot , ionized gas within a small radius , rather than letting it move outward by pressure .",
    "the actual situation is likely to be far more complicated , depending upon the luminosity and the spectrum of the radiation source , and also on the initial gas density profile .",
    "it is clearly important to make reliable predictions , under various physical conditions , as to how the gas is re - distributed by radiation from the central star .    throughout the present paper , we work with a @xmath17-dominated cdm",
    "cosmology with the matter density @xmath18 , the cosmological constant @xmath19 , the hubble constant @xmath20 , and the baryon density @xmath21 .",
    "we study the evolution of hii regions around a primordial star using the radiation - hydrodynamics code of kitayama et al .",
    "the code employs the second - order lagrangian finite - difference scheme in spherically symmetric geometry ( bowers & wilson 1991 ; see also thoul & weinberg 1995 ) .",
    "it treats self - consistently gravitational force , hydrodynamics , non - equilibrium chemistry of primordial gas , and the radiative transfer of uv photons . in the present paper ,",
    "we further incorporate the radiation force .",
    "we also adopt an artificial viscosity formulation of caramana , shashkov & whalen ( 1998 ) , designed to distinguish between shock - wave and uniform compression using an advection limiter .",
    "the basic equations are given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are the radius , mass , density , pressure , internal energy per unit mass , and the total mass inside @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "the radiative heating and cooling rates per unit volume , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , and the radiation force per unit mass , @xmath31 , depend on the solutions of the radiative transfer equation and the chemical reactions .",
    "we therefore take the following procedure at each timestep we advance with the momentum equation ( eq . [ [ eq : mom ] ] ) .",
    "first , the direction and frequency dependent radiative transfer is worked out as described in detail in appendix a. we solve both absorption and emission of ionizing ( @xmath32 ev ) photons and take account of self - shielding of h@xmath33 against the lyman - werner ( lw , 11.213.6 ev ) band photons following draine & bertoldi ( 1996 ) .",
    "this yields the uv heating rate @xmath29 and the radiation force @xmath34 , together with the coefficients for photoioniziation of h , photodissociation of h@xmath33 and h@xmath35 , and photodetachment of h@xmath36 .",
    "the obtained coefficients are used in the chemical reaction network mentioned below .",
    "secondly , non - equilibrium chemical reactions are solved by an implicit scheme developed by susa & kitayama ( 2000 ) for the species e , h , h@xmath37 , h@xmath36 , h@xmath33 , and h@xmath35 .. ] unless otherwise stated , the reactions and the rates are taken from the compilation of galli & palla ( 1998 ) .    finally , the energy equation ( eq . [ [ eq : eng ] ] ) is solved including uv heating and radiative cooling due to collisional ionization , collisional excitation , recombination , thermal bremsstrahlung , compton scattering with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation , and rotational - vibrational excitation of h@xmath33 .",
    "the atomic cooling rates are taken from the compilation of fukugita & kawasaki ( 1994 ) and molecular cooling rates from galli & palla ( 1998 ) .",
    "the above procedure is repeated iteratively until the abundance of each species and the internal energy in each mesh converge within an accuracy of 0.1% .",
    "we have validated the accuracy of our code by carrying out a suite of conventional tests .",
    "the results of a `` strmgren sphere '' test are presented in appendix b.      at the center of a gas cloud , we place a metal - free population iii star .",
    "its parameters are taken from schaerer ( 2002 ) and listed in table [ tab - star ] .",
    "we vary the stellar mass , denoted by @xmath38 , over the range @xmath39 and approximate the spectrum by a black - body with the effective temperature @xmath40 .",
    "the luminosity is normalized so that the number of ionizing photons emitted per second , @xmath41 , matches the time averaged photon flux given in table 5 of schaerer ( 2002 ) . for simplicity",

    "we assume that the dark matter density profile remains unchanged , since the halo dynamical timescale is much longer than the lifetime of the massive star .    for the gas in the halo",

    "are motivated by the results of recent three dimensional simulations of the primordial gas cloud formation ( abel et al .",
    "2002 ; yoshida et al .",
    "2003a ) which show that the gas density profile around the first star - forming regions is well described with @xmath61 over a wide range of radii .",
    "the gas density is normalized so that the total gas mass within the halo virial radius is equal to @xmath62 .",
    "we determine the radius of the inner - most gas shell @xmath63 such that @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the average hydrogen number density within @xmath23 .",
    "this density is comparable to that of primordial molecular cloud cores or fragments found in numerical simulations ( abel et al . 2002 ; bromm et al .",
    "2002 ; nakamura & umemura 2002 ) , and gives @xmath63 sufficiently smaller than the characteristic size of the simulated halos .",
    "our primary interest hence lies in the propagation of uv photons after they escape out of the dense molecular cloud .",
    "if a gas shell falls below @xmath66 , it is moved to the center and ignored in the rest of the simulation , except in the calculation of the gravitational force . in order to trace the propagation of an i - front for a sufficiently long time",
    ", the outer boundary is taken at @xmath67 times the virial radius depending on the run .",
    "the gas shells are initially spaced such that the shell mass increases by a constant ratio , typically @xmath68 , between the adjacent shells .",
    "we have checked that a total of 300 radial bins from the center to the outermost shell is sufficient to produce converged results .",
    "since the star - forming clouds are likely to be in the course of collapse , we assign the initial velocity @xmath69    we assume that the gas is initially isothermal with temperature @xmath70 , given by the _ minimum _ of the virial temperature @xmath71 and a reference temperature @xmath72 .",
    "we take @xmath73 k , corresponding to the gas which has cooled by molecular hydrogen cooling .",
    "the final results are found to be insensitive to the choice of @xmath72 , because , as long as @xmath74k , the gas is initially almost neutral and the opacity to ionizing photons is very large .",
    "the initial abundances are taken to be consistent with the above choice of the initial temperature based on the hydrodynamical simulations of kitayama et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ; @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the fraction of the species i with respect to the total number of hydrogen atoms .",
    "we first describe in detail the results of our fiducial runs with @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 .",
    "simulations with other sets of parameters are also carried out and the results are presented in due course .    figure [ fig : prof1 ] shows the structure of the hii region at @xmath83 ( initial ) , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 yr for a low mass case with @xmath86 .",
    "the evolution in the early stage is characterized by the propagation of a weak d - type front into the surroundings ; shock precedes the i - front . because of the steep density gradient , the i - front eventually overtakes the shock and changes into r - type .",
    "the transition takes place at @xmath87 yr ( see also figure [ fig : evol ] and discussions below ) . in this so - called `` champagne '' phase , the low - density envelope is promptly ionized ( welter 1980 ) and the gas temperature rises to a few times @xmath88  k. as the shock propagates at the speed @xmath89 km s@xmath90 , it reaches @xmath91 pc within the lifetime of the massive star , @xmath42=2.2 myr .",
    "the spatial resolution of the present simulation is sufficient to resolve the cooling layer behind the shocks ; e.g. , the i - front at @xmath92 yr in figure [ fig : prof1 ] is resolved with more than 10 shells .",
    "we have also performed the runs with halving and doubling the gas shell numbers and confirmed that the results are almost identical .",
    "we notice that there appears a thin shell of h@xmath33 just in front of the hii region ( fig .",
    "[ fig : prof1]e ) as pointed out by ricotti et al .",
    "this is due to a positive feedback on the h@xmath33 formation by an enhanced electron fraction at the temperature below @xmath88k .",
    "as the hii region expands , the temperature in the shell exceeds @xmath88k and h@xmath33 molecules are dissociated by collisions with ions .",
    "there still appears a new h@xmath33 shell in front of the i - front , but in a different position ( both eulerian and lagrangian ) from the previous one .",
    "the h@xmath33 shell is thus likely to be short - lived as a result of i - front propagation .",
    "there may also be a case that the h@xmath33 formation is promoted after the central star fades away and the gas cools to temperatures below @xmath88k .",
    "such a possibility will be explored later in this subsection .",
    "interestingly , the radiation force dominates over the gravitational force inside the hii region when the i - front radius is smaller than @xmath89 pc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : prof1]c ) .",
    "this value is a factor of @xmath93 smaller than that indicated by haehnelt ( 1995 ) , and easily accounted for by the fact that there is about 35 times more mass contributed by dark matter than baryons near the center in our simulations .    for a higher mass halo with @xmath94 illustrated in figure [ fig : prof2 ] ,",
    "the outward gas motion near the center is eventually reverted to an inflow .",
    "correspondingly , the shock radius starts _",
    "decreasing_. this reversion is explained by a combination of the deep gravitational potential well near the halo center and the infall of the envelope gas .",
    "notice that the ionization fraction decreases sharply at @xmath95 pc and @xmath92 yr .",
    "the infalling material piles on the shock front , enhancing recombination ( fig .",
    "[ fig : prof2]d ) .",
    "this is however just in a transition phase ; the piled gas rapidly falls back to the center .",
    "thereafter , the hii region is kept trapped within a few parsec radius because the gas density remains high ( @xmath96 ) and recombination balances photoionization .",
    "we have carried out a simulation for the same set of parameters but assuming that the gas is initially static . even in this case",
    ", the d - type front maintains over @xmath42=2.2 myr and reaches only @xmath97  pc , still well inside the virial radius .",
    "figure [ fig : evol ] further compares the time evolution in the two cases presented in figures [ fig : prof1 ] and [ fig : prof2 ] . for definiteness",
    ", we take the shock front radius at the peak of gas density and the i - front radius at the position with @xmath98 . the mass weighted mean fractions of hi and",
    "h@xmath33 are computed within the virial radius @xmath99 . for @xmath100 ,",
    "the i - front detaches from the shock at @xmath87 yr and then propagates rapidly , exceeding the halo virial radius .",
    "the halo gas is almost completely ionized in the first few hundred thousand years and then a large fraction of ionizing and the lw photons can escape from the halo .",
    "for @xmath101 , on the other hand , the i - front _ stalls _ at @xmath87 yr and then moves back inward .",
    "a large fraction of the gas is neutral but the h@xmath33 fraction drops by three orders of magnitude from the initial value because the lw photons can penetrate further than ionizing ones .",
    "the evolution after the lifetime of the central star ( @xmath102 myr ) is also plotted in figure [ fig : evol ] . in the @xmath103 case , if the central star simply fades away without triggering a supernova explosion ( as is assumed in our calculations ) , the gas is undisturbed and quickly recombine ( fig .",
    "[ fig : evol]c ) and reform molecules ( fig .",
    "[ fig : evol]d ) .",
    "the large ionization fraction within the hii region can accelerate production of hydrogen molecules through h@xmath104 formation .",
    "the shock front continues expanding until it dissipates kinetic energy .",
    "alternatively , if the central star turns into a supernova , it will generate a blastwave , which runs through the ambient gas .",
    "a quantity that is of particular importance in such a case is the final density of the evacuated gas near the center ( see  [ sec : imp ] for more details ) .",
    "it is in fact primarily determined by the host halo mass . in the low - mass case ( @xmath100 )",
    ", the central gas density drops to @xmath16 @xmath105 at @xmath106 myr .",
    "in the high - mass case ( @xmath107 ) , the central density remains much higher at @xmath108 .",
    "the threshold between the two cases closely follows that of the escape fraction of ionizing photons described in  [ sec : mcrit ] .",
    "a useful output of our simulations is the escape fractions of ionizing photons and the lw photons from a halo .",
    "the former is of particular significance in terms of early reionization of the universe ( e.g. , yoshida et al . 2003b ; sokasian et al .",
    "2004 ; whalen et al .",
    "2004 ) , while the latter quantifies the efficiency of the so - called negative feedback on subsequent star formation ( haiman , rees & loeb 1997 ; omukai & nishi 1999 ) .    in figures [ fig : fesc_ms][fig :",
    "fesc_zc ] , we plot the escape fractions , averaged over the lifetime of the central star , as a function of halo mass for various choices of @xmath38 , @xmath60 , and @xmath57 . in the case of @xmath109 ( figure [ fig : fesc_ms ] ) , for instance , the escape fraction of ionizing photons @xmath110 is below 0.5 over the range of @xmath56 we consider . for @xmath80 , on the other hand",
    ", @xmath111 is close to unity at @xmath112 but drops sharply at @xmath113 .",
    "there appears to be a critical mass of the host halo above which @xmath111 is essentially zero .",
    "for the escape fraction of the lw photons @xmath114 , similar features are found with a slightly larger critical mass , because the lw photons are harder to shield than ionizing photons .",
    "a plateau and a small dip at @xmath115 are real ; a minor leakage of ionizing photons causes a weak positive feedback on h@xmath33 formation by enhancing electron fraction ( haiman , rees & loeb 1996 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : fesc_w ] indicates that a steeper density profile leads to smaller escape fractions .",
    "this is because , for given gas mass in a halo , a steeper profile results in higher density near the center .",
    "the i - front propagation is then prevented at early stages due to the higher recombination rate .",
    "similarly , an earlier collapse epoch implies a denser , compact halo , from which escape fractions are smaller ( figure [ fig : fesc_zc ] ) .    strictly speaking , the self - shielding function of the lw photons we adopt ( drain & bertoldi 1996 ) is derived for the stationary gas . in the presence of supersonic flows ,",
    "the photons may doppler - shift out of or into particular lines in the lw band .",
    "detailed account for these effects requires precise treatment of the line transfer incorporating velocity and temperature structures of the gas , which is beyond the scope of the present paper . our results on @xmath114",
    "should therefore be regarded as a minimal estimation for the true value .",
    "figure [ fig : msm ] summarizes the degree of radiative feedback and photon escape as a function of @xmath38 , @xmath60 , and @xmath116 .",
    "low mass halos are ionized promptly after the onset of the central star , resulting in high escape fractions of both ionizing and the lw photons .",
    "on the other hand , the hii regions are heavily confined and the escape fractions are essentially zero in high mass halos . for",
    "intermediate halos , a significant fraction of the lw photons can escape from the halos while the ionizing photons are trapped .",
    "figure [ fig : msm ] further indicates that the threshold mass scale for the escape of ionizing photons , as a function of @xmath38 , @xmath60 , and @xmath116 , is well reproduced by the following analytic estimation .    over the range of gas density gradient we consider ( @xmath117 ) ,",
    "the shock velocity is a weak function of @xmath60 and given roughly by @xmath118 km s@xmath90 ( see also shu et al .",
    "for the low - mass halos considered in this paper , the gravitational infall velocity is @xmath119 km s@xmath90 . within the lifetime of the central star @xmath42 , the d - type front",
    "can then reach the distance @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the expansion velocity of a d - type front .",
    "this is in general much smaller than the virial radius of a halo in consideration : @xmath122 applicable to current cosmology at @xmath123 .",
    "it is therefore necessary for the i - front to become r - type in order to ionize the whole halo .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : prof1 ] , the gas density inside the shock front @xmath55 is nearly constant and approximated by the average density within @xmath55 : @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the initial gas density at @xmath55 , normalized by the condition that the total gas mass within @xmath99 is equal to @xmath126 .",

    "if helium is included in the calculation , the gas temperature will be higher by a factor of @xmath155 for @xmath156 k , because of an increase in the net heating rate ( abel & haehnelt 1999 ) .",

    "figure [ fig : cms ] shows that the halos are completely ionized and photons can escape from them even for @xmath177 .",
    "the dependences of @xmath175 on @xmath60 and @xmath116 do not agree with those of the threshold values of @xmath161 for @xmath164 either .",
    "these are the consequences of the enhanced ionization induced by the gas evacuation and the subsequent r - type i - front propagation .",
    "we stress that it is essential to incorporate the dynamical effects properly , as in equation ( [ eq - mcrit ] ) , to account for ionization of the halo with a steep density gradient .",
    "the hii regions around a massive short - lived star embedded in a steep density medium never settle into a static strmgren state .",
    "the i - front keeps expanding outward after the central star turns off .",
    "the relic hii regions then start cooling by recombination and inverse - compton cooling at such high redshifts , and the ionized fraction rapidly decreases while the outer part is still expanding .",
    "it is therefore meaningful to investigate how much gas is driven out of a halo in the end . in the cosmological context ,",
    "dark matter halos continue growing , so it is likely that the expelled gas eventually falls back into the halo by gravitational force .",
    "figure [ fig : fb ] shows the evolution of the baryon fraction within @xmath99 in the cases of @xmath179 and @xmath103 in our fiducial runs .",
    "the halo gas is almost completely evacuated by @xmath180 myr for @xmath181 . for @xmath86 ,",
    "on the other hand , the gas mass fraction slightly increases by gas accretion during the first few million years .",
    "this is simply because the shock radius is @xmath91 pc at @xmath180 myr , still inside the virial radius ( fig .",
    "[ fig : evol ] ) . even after the central star fades away",
    ", the gas will maintain its outward motion until it dissipates kinetic energy .",
    "the baryon fraction rapidly decreases at @xmath182 myr , when the shock front overtakes the virial radius .",
    "we have further carried out the runs with the same set of parameters as those in figure [ fig : fb ] but omitting the radiation force term in equation ( [ eq : mom ] ) .",
    "while the radiation force enhances the outward momentum of the gas at small radii ( figures [ fig : prof1 ] and [ fig : prof2 ] ) , it helps little to evacuate the gas from a halo ; the baryon fraction within @xmath99 is unchanged to within 5% when the radiation force is turned off .",
    "if the central population iii star is so massive that they collapse directly to form a blackhole ( see , e.g. fryer , heger & woosley 2001 ) , it does not disturb the gas mechanically any more .",
    "the ultimate fate of the expelled gas is then described in simple terms .",
    "the cooled gas does not provide hydrodynamic pressure in the relic hii region and thus at least some fraction of the gas eventually falls back toward the halo center ( i.e. , gravitational potential well ) after a while , gaining roughly a free - fall velocity .",
    "the free - fall time for a halo collapsing at @xmath183 is @xmath184 myr in our adopted @xmath17cdm cosmology .",
    "the host halo itself is growing in mass , but the growth timescale is also of the order @xmath185 .",
    "it is thus clear that the subsequent star - formation is possible only after this fallback of the gas happens , i.e. , gas condensation at the halo center begins only after a few times @xmath186 yr .",
    "note also that the evolution is more complicated when the central star explodes as a supernova . in such cases ,",
    "the halo gas may be swept up by the supernova blastwave .",
    "the internal feedback due to photodissociation of hydrogen molecules by radiation from the very first star likely prohibits further star - formation within the same halo ( omukai & nishi 1999 ) .",
    "our results ( figures [ fig : fesc_ms][fig : fesc_zc ] ) provide a reasonable estimation for the critical halo mass that determines the efficiency of the internal feedback in terms of @xmath114 .",
    "as shown in  3 , early star formation via h@xmath33 cooling will be self - regulated internally and suppressed in halos with @xmath187 .",
    "for such small halos , @xmath114 is high and the one - star - per - halo assumption adopted in the present paper is likely to be adequate . for halos with sufficiently larger mass and lower @xmath188",
    ", the multiple formation of stars or star clusters could take place .",
    "therefore , while the very first stars are likely to form in low - mass halos ( abel , bryan & norman 2002 ; bromm , coppi & larson 2002 ) , the subsequent star formation may be suppressed until slightly larger mass systems begin to collapse . the latter systems may dominate the cosmic star formation rate and metal production at high redshifts ( e.g. ricotti et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "note that our results are not restricted by the underlying one - star - per - halo assumption .",
    "we have shown that the emitted number of ionizing photons , not the number of stars itself , is a key parameter to control the photon escape fraction ( see eq . [ [ eq - mcrit ] ] ) .",
    "given a weak variation of the main sequence lifetime with mass , @xmath38 above @xmath189 can be interpreted as the _ total mass _ of stars with nearly eddington luminosities ; the case of a single @xmath190 star is almost equivalent to that of a few @xmath191 stars .",
    "our results can therefore be rescaled and applied to a wider range of stellar numbers .",
    "the present results on the evolution of hii regions may have profound implications for reionization of the universe .",
    "first , high values of photon escape fractions in low mass halos imply that such halos can be a major site of photon production at least in the early phase of reionization . in order to surpass recombination at @xmath192 , the emission rate of ionizing photons per unit comoving volume",
    "must be higher than @xmath193 s@xmath90 mpc@xmath194 , where @xmath195 is the clumping factor of the igm ( eq . [ 26 ] of madau , haardt & rees 1999 ) .",
    "this can be achieved if the comoving number of halos hosting a @xmath191 star is greater than @xmath196 mpc@xmath194 . in the absence of heavy metals",
    ", gas can condense to form stars by h@xmath33 cooling only in halos above the mass @xmath197 ( fuller & couchman 2000 ; yoshida et al .",
    "the number of halos just above @xmath198 , expected from the press & schechter ( 1974 ) mass function , is @xmath89 mpc@xmath194 at @xmath192 in the conventional @xmath17cdm model with @xmath199 .",
    "the number of low mass halos is thus comparable to that needed to ionize the igm for a moderate value of @xmath200 .",
    "as mentioned below , however , the photon production rate will be significantly suppressed once secondary feedback effects start to operate .",
    "secondly , given the sharp decline in photon escape fractions with increasing halo mass ( figs [ fig : fesc_ms][fig : fesc_zc ] ) , there remains only a narrow range of halo mass in which population iii stars can form and contribute to reionization .",
    "the photon production can therefore be stalled readily as the star formation in the low mass halos is suppressed by , for instance , the rise in the external uv radiation field ( e.g. , machacek , bryan & abel 2001 ; kitayama et al .",
    "2001 ; yoshida et al .",
    "2003a ; oh & haiman 2003 ) , and the mechanical energy input from supernovae ( e.g. , ricotti & ostriker 2004a ) .",
    "the photon emission may also decline as the transition from population iii to population ii stars takes place as a result of metal - enrichment ( cen 2003 ; mackey , bromm & hernquist 2003 ; bromm & loeb 2003 ) . due to high recombination rate at high redshifts ,",
    "the ionized fraction may even start decreasing after a brief period of star - formation in mini - halos .",
    "this can probably last until a considerable number of stars form in larger systems .",
    "we will investigate these points more quantitatively in our future publication .",
    "finally , evacuation of the halo gas by the central star may further delay the formation of mini - quasars that are suggested to be alternative reionization sources in the early universe ( e.g. madau et al .",
    "2004 ; ricotti & ostriker 2004b ) .",
    "such reionization models usually assume efficient gas accretion onto central blackholes that are the remnants of very massive ( @xmath201 ) population iii stars .",
    "our calculations , however , indicate that initial gas accretion should be very inefficient for the blackhole remnants that formed in small mass ( @xmath202 ) halos , because the halo gas is effectively evacuated in the first place , and , indeed , the gas continues moving outward for over @xmath186 yr after the central star dies .",
    "similar arguments hold for the formation of the second generation stars .",
    "it remains to be seen whether or not early reionization inferred by the wmap data is achieved in models with these ionizing sources .      mechanical feedback from the first stars is often cited as a destructive process in the context of early structure formation .",
    "if the mass of the central star lies in the range @xmath203 , it will explode as an energetic supernova via pair - instability mechanism ( barkat , rakavy , & sack 1967 ; bond , arnett , & carr 1984 ; fryer , woosley , & heger 2001 ; heger & woosley 2002 ) .",
    "it is also suggested that the observed abundance of metal - poor halo stars can be accounted for by a `` hypernova '' with progenitor mass @xmath204 ( umeda & nomoto 2002 , 2003 ) . in either case , the energy released can be as large as @xmath205 erg , which is much larger than the gravitational binding energy of a minihalo with mass @xmath206 .    at the first sight , this simple argument appears to support the notion that high-@xmath207 supernovae are enormously destructive .",
    "however , the evolution of the _ cooling _ supernova remnants ( snrs ) crucially depends on the properties of the surrounding medium , particularly on the central density after the gas is re - distributed by radiation .",
    "our simulations showed that the final gas density at the halo center is primarily determined by the host halo mass . for small - mass halos that are almost completely ionized by a massive star",
    ", the central gas density reduces to @xmath16 @xmath105 . a large fraction of the supernova explosion energy",
    "will then be converted into the kinetic energy of the ambient media . on the other hand , for the larger - mass halos , the central gas density exceeds @xmath88 @xmath105 .",
    "most of the explosion energy will be quickly radiated away via free - free emission and the inverse - compton scattering of the cmb photons .",
    "the free - free emission from the hot ( @xmath208k ) snr leads to soft - xray emission .",
    "it has been suggested that positive feedback , in terms of molecular hydrogen formation , is possible if an early x - ray background builds up ( haiman , abel & rees 2001 ; oh 2001 ; venkatesan , giroux & shull 2001 ; see however a counter argument by machacek et al 2003 )",
    ". population iii supernova remnants are therefore among the most plausible x - ray sources in the early universe .",
    "we will study in detail the evolution of the snr and the x - ray emission efficiency in a forthcoming paper .",
    "we have studied the structure and the evolution of early cosmological hii regions formed around the first stars . in particular",
    ", we addressed how efficiently the central stars ionize the gas in low - mass halos with @xmath209 collapsing at @xmath210 .",
    "we showed that a single massive star can ionize all the halo gas in a few million years if the host halo mass is smaller than a few million solar masses .",
    "the final ionization fraction of the halo gas depends sensitively on the initial gas density profile as well as the host halo mass . while a few previous cosmological simulations suggest an approximately isothermal density profile ( @xmath211 ) around the first star - forming regions , the exact slope may vary among the primordial gas clouds .",
    "we therefore carried out a number of simulations for plausible cases and explored a large parameter space .",
    "for a similar set of parameters , our results are in good agreement with those of whalen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , who studied the case of @xmath212 and @xmath213 .",
    "the formation of the hii region is characterized by initial slow expansion of a weak d - type ionization front near the center , followed by rapid propagation of an r - type front throughout the outer gas envelope .",
    "we find that the transition between the two front types is indeed a critical condition for the complete ionization of halos of cosmological interest .",
    "this accounts for the fact that the photon escape fraction has a sharp transition from @xmath214 to @xmath215 at a certain critical mass scale of @xmath216 .",
    "it is also responsible for the fact that the whole halo can be ionized under smaller values of photon - to - baryon ratio than the effective clumping factor .",
    "the radiation force can contribute to enhancing the outward motion within @xmath89 pc at the initial stage of expansion .",
    "based on the obtained numerical results , we developed an analytic model to predict the escape fractions of ionizing photons and dissociating photons .",
    "we find that there is a narrow range of halo mass in which population iii stars can form and contribute to ionizing the universe , provided that low mass halos are in infall phases and host a small number of massive stars .",
    "the analytic model and the numerical results presented in this paper provide useful ingredients for the studies of early reionization , the evolution of high - redshift supernova remnants , and the formation of the second generation stars .",
