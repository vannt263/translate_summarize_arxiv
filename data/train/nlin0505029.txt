    "when a limit - cycle oscillator is driven weakly by the same temporal sequence of a fluctuating input , its phase tends to exhibit the same dynamics repetitively among different realizations even if small external disturbances distinguish each realization .",
    "for example , a cortical neuron generates spikes more reproducibly when it receives a fluctuating input current rather than a constant input current  @xcite .",
    "this fluctuation - induced reproducibility of a single oscillator can be interpreted as phase synchronization between uncoupled oscillators driven by common external forcing , because repeated measurements on a single oscillator using the same input is equivalent to a single measurement on multiple identical oscillators .",
    "it indicates the existence of a physical mechanism that statistically stabilizes the limit - cycle orbit in the phase direction by a fluctuating input .",
    "there have been a variety of studies regarding this phenomenon  @xcite . among them , teramae and tanaka  @xcite made significant progress in understanding its universality from the viewpoint of nonlinear dynamics . using the stratonovich - langevin equation resulting from the phase reduction method  @xcite , they generally proved that limit - cycle oscillators always synchronize in phase when they are driven by a vanishingly weak gaussian - white forcing ( see also goldobin and pikovsky  @xcite ) .",
    "independently , we also analyzed this phenomenon in a different setting  @xcite .",
    "we assumed a simple random telegraphic forcing to the oscillator that switches between two values randomly , which is not necessarily vanishingly small .",
    "we reduced the dynamics of the system to a pair of random maps , and generally showed that the oscillators always synchronize in phase when the phase map is monotonic .    in this paper",
    ", we consider yet another model of fluctuation - induced phase synchronization .",
    "specifically , we assume the external forcing to be random impulses .",
    "such a model has wide applications to various natural phenomena , since impulsive noises are abundant in nature  @xcite .",
    "for example , a cortical neuron interacts with other neurons via spike trains , which are modeled as impulses in the simplest approximation  @xcite . within this model",
    ", we can generally prove that the oscillators actually undergo fluctuation - induced phase synchronization in the limit of large inter - impulse intervals .",
    "in addition , we can also discuss the case where the inter - impulse interval is finite within this model . both of the previous analyses in refs .",
    "@xcite assumed that the phase distribution of the oscillator is completely uniform on the limit cycle , which corresponds to the assumption of vanishingly weak or infinitely slow - switching external forcing .",
    "however , in practical situations , such assumptions may not be valid , and the phase distribution would generally be non - uniform .",
    "thus , the effect of non - uniform phase distribution on the phase synchronization should be assessed . by developing a perturbation theory for weak impulse intensity",
    ", we discuss the effect of slight non - uniformity of the phase distribution on the phase synchronization .",
    "especially , we will show that the phase synchronization persists even if the phase distribution becomes slightly non - uniform for the poissonian impulses .",
    "our analysis presented in this paper will extend the class of fluctuation - driven limit - cycle oscillators that exhibit phase synchronization , and will provide deeper insight into this phenomenon .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , a general model of impulse - driven limit - cycle oscillators is introduced , and phase synchronization is demonstrated using two typical limit - cycle oscillators . in section iii ,",
    "reduction of the dynamics of impulse - driven oscillators to a random phase map is presented . in section iv ,",
    "stability in the phase direction is analyzed in the case where the phase distribution is uniform . in section",

    "we first present a general model of limit - cycle oscillators driven by a common external impulsive forcing , which we will analyze in later sections .",
    "then , before going into a general theory , we numerically demonstrate phase synchronization induced by external impulses using two typical models of limit - cycle oscillators , and briefly comment on its mechanism .",
    "we consider an ensemble of @xmath4 identical limit - cycle oscillators subject to a common external impulsive forcing in the following general form : @xmath5 for @xmath6 , where @xmath7 represents the internal state of the @xmath8-th oscillator at time @xmath9 and @xmath10 its dynamics .",
    "we assume that eq.([eq : ode ] ) has a single stable limit - cycle solution @xmath11 in the absence of external impulsive forcing @xmath12 , whose basin of attraction is the entire phase space except some unstable fixed points .",
    "external impulsive forcing @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 are occurrence times of the impulses , and @xmath15 are random vectors representing the `` direction '' of the impulses .",
    "when the oscillator receives an impulse at @xmath16 , its state @xmath17 is suddenly kicked by a random displacement @xmath18 to a new state @xmath19 .",
    "we assume that the direction of the impulse @xmath20 is mutually independent and identically distributed .",
    "we denote its probability density by @xmath21 , which is normalized as @xmath22 .",
    "we also assume the interval @xmath23 between two successive impulses to be independent and identically distributed .",
    "we denote its probability density function by @xmath24 , which is normalized as @xmath25 .",
    "we further assume the intervals to be sufficiently long , so that the orbit kicked away from the limit cycle by an impulse can return to the limit cycle before the next impulse .",
    "this is the necessary condition for the phase description of the oscillator , which we adopt in the following discussion .",
    "the time needed for this process of course depends on the characteristic of the oscillator and on the intensity of the impulses , which is very roughly of the order of the period of the limit cycle .    in this paper",
    ", we mainly consider impulses generated by a poissonian process",
    ". then eqs.([eq : ode ] ) and ( [ eq : impulse ] ) describe a poisson - driven markov process  @xcite . in the poissonian process",
    ", an impulse is generated with probability @xmath26 in an infinitesimal time interval @xmath27 .",
    "the probability density @xmath24 of the inter - impulse interval @xmath23 is given by the exponential distribution @xmath28 where @xmath29 determines the mean inter - impulse interval .",
    "of course , in this poissonian case , there exists a certain probability that the generated interval becomes shorter than the above - mentioned return time of a kicked orbit to the limit cycle .",
    "in such a case , the phase description fails to approximate the true dynamics precisely .",
    "however , when @xmath30 is sufficiently large , such probability becomes small , and the phase description would be a good approximation statistically .",
    "the probability density of the impulse direction @xmath21 should be chosen properly depending on the problem under consideration .",
    "for example , when we consider neural oscillators , usually only the membrane potential can be stimulated experimentally by a current injection .",
    "therefore , the random vector @xmath20 has only one non - zero element corresponding to the voltage component of @xmath31 , and we only need to consider one - dimensional probability density @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the intensity of the current impulse . in the following examples ,",
    "we only treat the cases where the stimulus can take a single fixed direction and intensity @xmath34 , namely @xmath35 , but we present our theory in a general form so that it is also applicable to the case where the stimulus takes various direction and intensity .",
    "our first example is an ensemble of noisy stuart - landau oscillators  @xcite driven by a common sequence of poissonian random impulses with fixed intensity .",
    "the stuart - landau oscillator is the simplest limit - cycle oscillator , which is derived as a normal form of the super - critical hopf bifurcation  @xcite .",
    "the model is described by @xmath36 for @xmath6 , where @xmath37 is the complex amplitude of the @xmath8-th oscillator , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are real parameters , @xmath40 represents a sequence of external impulses , and @xmath41 is a mutually independent complex gaussian - white noise additionally introduced to represent small external disturbances . for simplicity , we drive only the real part of @xmath37 by the external impulsive forcing @xmath40 , which is given by @xmath42 where the real parameter @xmath33 represents the intensity of the impulses , @xmath43 the time of occurrence of the impulse , and @xmath44 the dirac s delta function .",
    "the impulses are generated by a poisson process with mean inter - impulse interval @xmath30 .",
    "when the oscillator receives an impulse , its real component @xmath45 suddenly jumps by an amount @xmath33 .",
    "it is assumed that the complex gaussian - white noise @xmath41 has zero - mean , and whose variance is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 determines the noise intensity .",
    "we fix the parameters at @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and the noise strength at @xmath51 .",
    "we initially set the phase @xmath52 of each oscillator uniformly and randomly on @xmath53 $ ] ( see the next section for the precise definition of the `` phase '' ) , where the zero - crossing point of @xmath37 from @xmath54 to @xmath55 is chosen as the origin of phase , @xmath56 .",
    "we then evolve the oscillators under the influence of the poissonian impulses and the weak gaussian - white noise .",
    "figures  [ fig : sl_raster_order](a ) and ( b ) plot zero - crossing events of @xmath37 of @xmath57 stuart - landau oscillators by bars ( so - called raster plot ) after transient for the cases @xmath58 and @xmath0 .",
    "it can be seen that the oscillators synchronize in phase when @xmath59 , whereas they do not synchronize at all when @xmath58 . to quantify the degree of synchronization ,",
    "we introduce an order parameter  @xcite @xmath60 using phase @xmath52 of each oscillator .",

    "figures [ fig : hh_raster_order](a),(b ) show zero - crossing events of an ensemble of 50 hodgkin - huxley neural oscillators without or with external impulses ( @xmath58 or @xmath97 ) after the initial transient .",

    "the mechanism of phase synchronization induced by common external input is basically a single - oscillator problem , though we consider an ensemble of oscillators in the above examples .",
    "the origin of the phase synchronization is the local stabilization of each limit cycle in the phase direction due to the external impulses .",
    "namely , small phase disturbances of a single oscillator shrink statistically , as we formulate in the following sections by reducing the dynamics of each oscillator to a random phase map . at the same time",
    ", it indicates the suppression of small difference in phase between any pair of oscillators . due to random impulses ,",
    "the phase of each oscillator diffuses on the limit cycle in addition to the constant rotation .",
    "once two phases of any pair of the oscillators come close accidentally , their difference can no longer grow but shrinks statistically due to the local stability , leading to the synchrony of the entire ensemble .",
    "this mechanism has certain similarity to that of chaos synchronization induced by common random forcing  @xcite .    in the second example",
    ", we demonstrated that external impulses do not only lead to phase synchronization but can also cause phase desynchronization .",
    "though we mainly focus on phase synchronization in this paper , this fact is important in understanding that fluctuation - induced phase synchronization is not a trivial phenomenon but has some subtleties .",
    "in order to analyze the stability against phase disturbances , we first reduce the dynamics of our impulse - driven limit - cycle oscillator to a random phase map .      following the standard procedure  @xcite",

    "this definition of phase can be extended to the entire phase space except at phase - singular points , yielding a phase field @xmath110 .",
    "it is achieved by identifying a point @xmath111 in the phase space with a point @xmath112 right on the limit cycle in such a way that the two orbits started from @xmath111 and @xmath112 asymptotically coincide .",

    "the phase @xmath113 obeys @xmath114 on the entire phase space ( except at phase - singular points ) .",
    "when the external impulses are given , the orbit is perturbed .",
    "let us assume that the orbit is on the limit - cycle at time @xmath115 , i.e. immediately before the @xmath116-th impulse ( we say the orbit is `` on '' the limit cycle when it is sufficiently close to the limit cycle . ) we denote its location by @xmath117 and its phase by @xmath118 .",
    "we also denote the interval between the @xmath116-th impulse and the next @xmath119-th impulse by @xmath120 .",

    "when we consider poissonian random impulses , the time step @xmath116 roughly corresponds to the real time @xmath9 as @xmath144 , because the mean inter - impulse interval is @xmath30 .",
    "if we go back to the continuous description , the dynamics of the phase @xmath108 can be written as @xmath145 the external impulse is now explicitly multiplicative in this equation .",
