    "a basic question in random matrix theory is to ask for the probability distribution of the number of real eigenvalues for an ensemble of @xmath2 random matrices with real entries . with the ensemble made up of standard gaussian random matrices , i.e.  in the circumstance that each element is independently chosen as a real standard gaussian , edelman @xcite was the first person to obtain results on this problem .",
    "the approach taken centered on knowledge of the explicit functional form of the probability density function ( pdf ) for the event that there are @xmath0 real eigenvalues denoted @xmath3 , and @xmath4 complex eigenvalues denoted @xmath5 with @xmath6 ( the fact that the complex eigenvalues occur in complex conjugate pairs implies @xmath0 must have the same parity as @xmath7 ) .",
    "thus it was shown that this is equal to @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the vandermonde determinant and @xmath10 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "integrating ( [ 3.1 ] ) over @xmath11 gives the probability @xmath12 that there are exactly @xmath0 real eigenvalues .",
    "the simplest case to compute is when @xmath13 and thus all eigenvalues are real , for which the probability was found to equal @xmath14 .",
    "questions relating to the probability that all eigenvalues are real for random matrices with real entries occur in applications .",
    "consider first the tensor structure @xmath15 , represented as the column vector @xmath16 .",
    "as reviewed in @xcite , it is of interest to find matrices @xmath17",
    "\\in \\mathbb r^{p \\times r}$ ] , @xmath18 \\in \\mathbb r^{p \\times r}$ ] , @xmath19 \\in \\mathbb r^{2 \\times r}$ ] such that @xmath20 for @xmath21  referred to as the rank  as small as possible .",
    "it turns out that with both @xmath22 and @xmath23 random matrices , entries chosen from a continuous distribution , one has that @xmath24 if all the eigenvalues of @xmath25 are real , and @xmath26 otherwise @xcite . in the gaussian case",
    "these probabilities have been computed in @xcite and @xcite as equal to @xmath27 , where @xmath28 denotes the barnes @xmath1-function , and the corresponding large @xmath21 asymptotic form has been computed in @xcite .",
    "a second example comes from quantum entanglement .",
    "lakshminarayan @xcite considered the problem of quantifying when two - qubits @xmath29 and @xmath30 are an optimal pair , in the case that the states are chosen from a uniform distribution on the unit 3sphere .",
    "the condition of being an optimal pair is known @xcite as particular inequalities for certain weighted inner products between the qubits .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that these can be interpreted as the condition for the probability that the random matrix product @xmath31 , with each @xmath32 a @xmath33 real gaussian matrix , having all eigenvalues real , which was furthermore shown to be equal to @xmath34 .",
    "an intriguing effect was observed in the study @xcite , which seems to have escaped early notice .",
    "thus , noting from the result of edelman cited above that for a single real gaussian @xmath33 random matrix the probability of all eigenvalues being real is equal to @xmath35 , while for a product of two independent gaussian @xmath33 random matrices it is @xmath34 , the fact that @xmath36 led lakshminarayan to investigate if the probability of all eigenvalues being real was an increasing function of the number of matrices in the product .",
    "numerical simulation indicated that this is indeed the case , and further the probability that all eigenvalues are real tends to unity as the number of random matrices in the product tends to infinity .",
    "evidence that this is also true for products of @xmath37 real gaussian matrices was given in @xcite , while the follow up work @xcite provided similar evidence for random matrices with independent non - gaussian entries . a proof in the instance of the latter circumstance that the entries are all independent and identically distributed with a pdf containing an atom has recently been given in @xcite .",
    "the appearance of the work @xcite coincided with the appearance of works containing other surprising advances relating to the eigenvalues of products of random matrices .",
    "consider the random matrix product @xmath38 where each @xmath32 is an @xmath2 standard gaussian matrix . in the case of complex entries , akemann and",
    "burda @xcite showed that the eigenvalues form a determinantal point process in the complex plane .",
    "this means that the @xmath0-point correlation function for the eigenvalues @xmath39 is fully determined by a single function @xmath40 , referred to as the correlation kernel , according to @xmath41_{j , l=1,\\dots , k}.\\ ] ] in the case of real entries , forrester @xcite found a closed form expression for the probability that all eigenvalues are real .    to specify",
    "this latter result requires introducing the meijer @xmath1-function @xmath42 where @xmath43 is an appropriate contour relating to the validity of the inverse mellin transform formula . with @xmath44 denoting the probability that the random matrix product @xmath45 ( [ yx ] ) has exactly @xmath0 real eigenvalues it was shown in @xcite that , for each @xmath32 a real ginibre matrix , we have @xmath46_{k=1,\\ldots , n/2}^{j=1,\\ldots , n/2}\\big ] , & n\\ \\text{even}\\\\[2 mm ] \\det\\big [ [ a_{j , k}]_{k=1,\\ldots,(n-1)/2}^{j=1,\\ldots,(n+1)/2}\\quad   [ \\tilde a_j]_{j=1,\\ldots,(n+1)/2}\\big ] , & n\\ \\text{odd } \\end{cases}\\ ] ] with @xmath47 a simple identity for the meijer @xmath1-function  evident from the definition ( [ gg ] )  shows that @xmath48 is equal to the meijer @xmath1-function occurring in  @xcite .",

    "also for this case forrester and nagao @xcite gave a result more general than ( [ a1 ] ) , applying to a real random matrix formed from a general linear combination of gaussian symmetric and anti - symmetric matrices .",
    "we now turn our attention to the other primary aim of our work .",
    "this relates to the statistical state formed by the eigenvalues of the product ( [ yx ] ) . in the complex case",
    ", it has been remarked that the statistical state is a determinantal point process . in the real case",
    ", it is known from the work of ipsen and kieburg @xcite that the eigenvalue correlations form instead a pfaffian point process .",
    "thus , considering for definiteness the real eigenvalues , one now has @xmath68_{j , l=1,\\dots , k } , \\qquad \\mathbf k^{\\rm rr } ( x , y ) = \\begin{bmatrix } d(x , y ) & s(x , y ) \\\\",

    "a concern of the present paper is to compute the explicit form of the correlation kernel in ( [ k0 ] ) in the case of the real eigenvalues of ( [ yx ] ) for real standard gaussian matrices , and also for the case of the complex eigenvalues . in this paper",
    ", we will see that these correlation kernels possess many similarities with other results for product of random matrices .",
    "for example , the kernel for the pfaffian point process specifying the scaled statistical state about the origin of the real eigenvalues of products of real ginibre matrices is given in terms of meijer @xmath1-functions .",
    "in the simplest case of the one point function @xmath73 the resulting functional form is very succinct .",

    "moreover , for fixed @xmath7 , knowledge of the real - to - real eigenvalue correlations gives information about the moments of the distribution function for the probability that there are @xmath0 real eigenvalues .",
    "in particular , integration of the spectral density ( one - point function ) gives the expected number of real eigenvalues .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : jpdf ] we find the joint eigenvalue pdf for a gaussian product matrix with a given number of real eigenvalues . in section  [ sec :",
    "skew ] we introduce the generalised partition function and find the skew - orthogonal polynomials ; we combine these results with the joint eigenvalues pdf to prove theorem  [ t1 ] .",
    "section  [ sec : corr ] focuses on the real - to - real and the complex - to - complex eigenvalue correlations . in",
    "particularly , we study local and global scaling limits for the spectral densities and use the real spectral density to compute the expected number of real eigenvalues . the final section briefly sketches how all these results may be extended to products of rectangular matrices .",
    "our first task is to find the explicit functional form for the eigenvalue pdf of the random matrix product ( [ yx ] ) in the case that each @xmath32 is an independent @xmath2 standard real gaussian matrix . with this specification",
    "the joint probability measure for @xmath76 is equal to @xmath77 actually this task , extended to the general bi - orthogonal invariant ensembles , has already been addressed by ipsen and kieburg @xcite .",
    "however the workings therein are not sufficient for all our purposes . in particular proportionality constants",
    "are ignored , meaning that it is not possible to proceed to derive the formulas of theorem [ t1 ] for the probabilities @xmath44 .",
    "these normalisation constants were included in the thesis  @xcite but the pdf were given in terms of @xmath78 matrices , which is impractical for our purpose .",
    "furthermore , the case that the working of @xcite  which is a generalisation of the strategies used in @xcite and @xcite in the cases @xmath67 and @xmath79 respectively  treats the real and complex eigenvalues on an equal footing , whereas we prefer to proceed in the way used in @xcite for @xmath67 which distinguishes the real and complex eigenvalues from the outset .",
