    "the role played by ground state nucleon ",
    "nucleon(nn ) correlations ( or _ initial state correlations _ ( isc ) ) on the nuclear transparency in semi - inclusive processes have been investigated by many authors .",
    "( see e.g. @xcite- @xcite ) with conflicting results .",
    "all of these works adopt the glauber multiple scattering approach for the description of the final state interaction ( fsi ) , and treat isc within different schemes and approximations , ranging from phenomenological jastrow wave functions embodying only central correlations @xcite , @xcite to various expansions in terms of correlated density matrices @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "recently , seki et al.@xcite have performed an elaborated calculation of the transparency using , by means of a local density approximation ( lda ) , realistic nuclear matter correlation functions for finite nuclei , and taking into account glauber multiple scattering to all orders .",
    "such a calculation represents a significant progress in the field , but it should be pointed out that a direct calculation of the transparency using realistic wave functions resulting from the solution of the many - body problem and implemented by glauber multiple scattering operators , is still lacking .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to present such a calculation for the process @xmath1 , for which we have calculated both the nuclear transparency and the distorted momentum distributions @xmath3 .",
    "the latter quantity has been recently calculated in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it has been argued that the high momentum part of @xmath3 which could be measured by semi - inclusive processes , is almost entirely dominated by fsi , leaving little room for the investigation of isc .",
    "the results of @xcite are based on the use of phenomenological jastrow wave functions constructed from harmonic oscillator orbitals and simple central correlation functions . since realistic nuclear wave functions exhibit a complex correlation structure generated by the very nature of the nn interaction , which can not be recoinciled with the jastrow correlation function , it is imperative to consider the effect of fsi within a realistic treatement of isc .",
    "this is precisely the aim of the present paper where , as in ref.@xcite , glauber multiple scattering is taken into account exactly to all order , but , at the same time , wave functions embodying realistic central , tensor , spin , isospin , etc . correlations are . for the firdt time , employed in this kind of calculations",
    "thus , our approach is basically the same as the one of ref .",
    "@xcite ( i.e. glauber multiple scattering and isc taken into account to all orders ) , with the substantial difference of using a realistic four body wave function .",
    "our paper is organised as follows : in section [ sec : crosssection ] the concepts of semi - inclusive processes , distorted momentum distributions and nuclear transparency , will be racalled;the structure of the @xmath0he wave function used in the calculations will be briefly described in section [ sec : atms ] ; the results of calculations of the nuclear transparency and the distorted momentum distributions will be presented in sections [ sec : transparency ] and [ sec : momentum ] , respectively ; the summary and conclusions are given in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this section we will consider the process @xmath4 in which an electron with 4-momentum @xmath5 , is scattered off a nucleus with 4-momentum @xmath6 to a state @xmath7 and is detected in coincidence with a proton @xmath8 with 4-momentum @xmath9 ; the final @xmath10 nuclear system with 4-momentum @xmath11 is undetected . from now on , we will closely follow the formalism of ref .",

    "the integral over the missing energy of the distorted spectral function defines the distorted momentum distribution as    @xmath39    in impulse approximation ( ia ) ( i.e. when the final state interaction is disregarded ( @xmath40 ) ) , if the system @xmath22 is assumed to be a @xmath10 nucleus in the discrete or continuum states @xmath41 , the distorted spectral function @xmath42 reduces to the usual spectral function i.e.    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the nucleon removal energy i.e. the energy required to remove a nucleon from the target , leaving the @xmath45 nucleus with excitation energy @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the nucleon momentum before interaction .",

    "in this section the results of the calculations of the nuclear transparency will be presented .",
    "let us first discuss the much debated topic concerning the effects of nn correlations on the transparency . to this end , as a @xmath89 of eq .",

    "@xmath109    where the quantities @xmath110 and @xmath111 are determined by the continuity condition , and @xmath112 and @xmath113 are fixed so as to reproduce , respectively , the asymptotic behaviour of the realistic two - body function @xmath114 and the root mean square radius ( @xmath115 ) provided by the realistic wave function , i.e. @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "thus , by calculating the nuclear transparency using the full realistic , @xmath94 , and the mean field , @xmath108 , wave functions , one can ascribe any difference in the results to the effect of the correlations .",
    "the results of the calculation are presented in table  [ tab : transparency ] , where it can be seen that the effect of correlations on the transparency , given by the difference between @xmath118 and @xmath119 , is very small ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "we have also calculated @xmath58 with the jastrow - type wave function    @xmath121    used in @xcite with @xmath122 .",
    "it can be seen from table  [ tab : transparency ] that in such a case correlation effects amount to @xmath123 , which is about a factor of two larger than in the realistic case . since the jastrow - type correlation function in eq .",
    "( [ eq : jastrow ] ) takes only into account short - range repulsive correlations , the difference between the realistic and the jastrow cases should be ascribed to the intermediate - range attractive correlation which is provided by realistic correlation function . in order to clearly illustrate this point , the realistic correlation function @xmath124 is compared with the jastrow one in fig .",
    "[ fig : correlation ] , and the strong overshooting in the function , which is induced by the attractive correlation , and which is lacking in the jastrow phenomenological wave function , can be noticed .",
    "the attractive correlation enhances fsi effects and , as a result , the nuclear transparency is reduced because of the cancellation between short - range repulsive and intermediate - range attractive correlations .",
    "the tensor - type correlations , which are induced by the realistic interaction , produce a d - wave component in the @xmath0he wave function .",
    "the value of the nuclear transparency calculated without the d - wave component , denoted @xmath125 in table  [ tab : transparency ] , does not appreciably differ from the full results ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "however , one should not share the mistaken believe that tensor correlations are unimportant , because the shape of the correlation function shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : correlation ] , which determines the relative strength between repulsive and attractive correlations , is strongly affected by the tensor force through the s - d wave coupling .",
    "therefore , the inclusion of tensor correlations is essential in determining the exact correlation function with the proper overshooting , even if the presence of the d - wave in the wave functions provides only a small contribution to the transparency .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the effect of correlations on the transparency should be very small , because of the cancellation between the _ hole _ and _ spectator _ effects . in order to check whether such a conclusion holds in a realistic approach to correlations",
    ", we have calculated the _ hole _ contribution to the transparency , by removing correlations among all the spectator pairs setting @xmath126 for all spectator-(ij ) pairs .",
    "the result , denoted by @xmath127no spect.@xmath128 in table  [ tab : transparency ] , practically does not differ from the full reuslt @xmath118 , which includes _ hole _ and _ spectator _ correlations .",
    "this clearly shows that the _ spectator _ effect is extremely small and that there is no significant cancellation between _ hole _ and _ spectator _ correlations .",
    "let us now discuss the convergence of the glauber multiple scattering series . to this end , using eq .",
    "( [ eq : s ] ) , the operator @xmath129 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhod ] ) is expanded in the following way    @xmath130    several approaches in the field ( @xcite , @xcite ) rely on the truncation of the glauber multiple scattering series taking into account only the single rescattering term @xmath131 . in table",
    "[ tab : glauber ] the contribution to the transparency from the various terms of the series in eq .",

    "it can be seen that @xmath132 amounts to @xmath133 of the first order contribution @xmath131 , and its inclusion changes the total @xmath58 by about @xmath134 .",
    "therefore the double rescattreing term @xmath132 should not be disregarded in the calculation of the transparency .",
    "in this section the results of the calculations of the distorted momentum distributions will be presented .",
    "we will compare our results with the ones obtained in @xcite using phenomenological jastrow wave functions adopting the same form and parameters for @xmath135 in e q.  ( [ eq : jastrow ] ) , namely the harmonic oscillator wave function @xmath108 with parameter @xmath136 , and the central correlation function with parameter @xmath137 .",

    "the numerical integration of @xmath145 with realistic wave functions has been performed by the quasi random number ( @xmath146 ) method @xcite .",
    "let us consider the distorted momentum distributions and let us demonstrate that the relevance of fsi effects strongly depends upon the type of ground state wave functions . to this end",
    ", we consider the mean field result given by the harmonic oscillator model wave function and the realistic one calculated by the atms wave function . the results for the parallel distorted momentum distributions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gr+fsi ] .",
    "it can be seen that :    1 .   as expected , the main effect of fsi is to enhance the content of high momentum components ( cf .",
    "3(a ) ) ; 2 .",
    "fsi are reduced when the correct high momentum content of realistic ground state wave functions is taken into account ( cf .",
    "3(b ) ) .",
    "let us now compare the effects of fsi in the realistic and jastrow cases . to this end , the undistorted and distorted ( anti)parallel and perpendicular momentum distributions",
    "are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : mdis_overview ] .",
    "the results there shown , clearly exhibit again a strong dependence of fsi upon the type of ground state correlations ; it can in particular be seen that fsi are much larger in the jastrow case . only in the case of perpendicular kinematics ,",
    "the distorted momentum distributions appear to be the same in the jastrow and realistic cases : at @xmath147 , glauber multiple scattering fsi produces the largest content of high momentum components . eventually , in fig .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] the overall comparison between the realistic and the jastrow distorted momentum distributions is presented and the following points are worth being noticed :    1 .",
    "a sizeable difference between jastrow and realistic wave functions shows up in the low momentum region ; such a difference should be ascribed both to the tail behaviour of the wave functions , with the jastrow function having the wrong asymptotics , and to the attractive correlation effect discussed in the previous section .",
    "the longitudinal momentum distributions appreciably differ in the high momentum region @xmath148 , which is mainly due to the effect of the d - wave , which is absent in the jastrow wave function .",
    "the effect of the d - wave component will be discussed below in more details .    in order to better visualize the effect of fsi , the quantity @xmath149 , i.e. the ratio between the distorted and undistorted momentum distributions , is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] .",
    "it can be seen that while the parallel and anti - parallel ratios are of the order of unity , the perpendicular ratio may reach ( in the jastrow case ) almost an order of magnitude .",
    "this is a natural result which comes from the glauber profile function @xmath70 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) ; in fact , due to its short - range nature in the @xmath150 plane , it creates a high momentum components at transverse directions .",
    "thus at perpendicular kinematics , fsi dominates the high momentum component induced by ground state correlations , as pointed out in ref .",
    "however , from a quantitative point of view , its magnitude largely depends upon the nature of correlations , as clearly illustrated by the differences exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] by jastrow and realistic wave functions",
    ". the smaller effect of fsi in the realistic case is mainly due to the d - wave component produced by the tensor - type correlations . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the d - wave component , being more peripheral with respect to the s - wave component , is less affected by fsi , since for a peripheral nucleon the probability of a collision is reduced . this is clearly demonstrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : angular ] where the angular dependence of the distorted momentum distribution is plotted for a fixed value of the missing momentum @xmath151 .",
    "the figure shows indeed that the d - wave component ( dot - dashed curve ) is little affected by fsi ( remember that the undistorted momentum distribution is angle independent ) .",
    "the effects of the @xmath152 wave in the deuteron in the process @xmath153 , has been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite ; the results obtained here for @xmath154 are qualitatively similar to the ones found there , with expected and obvious quantitative differences , due to the different role played by the @xmath152 wave in the four - body system .",
    "an intersting quantity is the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath155 @xmath156 which has been first introduced in @xcite in the analysis of the process @xmath153 .",
    "the interest in the asymmetry , which differs from zero because of the fsi , stems from the following reason : since , as previously illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : angular ] , the d - wave component has little asymmetry , @xmath155 gets contribution almost entirely from the @xmath157-wave .",
    "this suggests that this quantity might give an useful information on the s - wave component .",
    "to demonstrate such a point , we have calculated @xmath155 with the realistic wave function by changing the d - wave probability @xmath42 within a reasonable range @xcite .",
    "the results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : asymmetry ] , which indeed shows that @xmath155 slightly depend upon the @xmath154 @xmath152-wave probability . in the figure",
    "the predictions by the jastrow wave function are also shown ( @xcite ) and , again , it can be seen that they are qualitatively similar to the realistic ones , but quantitatively different .",
    "in this paper we have thoroughly investigated the isc and fsi effects of correlations on the nuclear transparency and distorted momentum distributions of of the semi - inclusive process @xmath1 ; fsi were treated within the glauber approach , according to @xcite , whereas the effects of isc result from the use of a variational four - body wave function , corresponding to a realistic nucleon - nucleon interactions producing central , tensor , spin and isospin correlations .",
    "our main results can be summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "the effect of realistic nn correlations on nuclear transparency @xmath58 amounts to @xmath120 .",
    "such a small value mainly results from the cancellation between short - range repusive correlations and intermediate - range attractive correlations originating from the central - tensor coupling , and not from the cancellation between the _ hole _ and the _ spectator _ correlation contributions , for the latter is always much smaller than the former and thus there is no significant cancellation between them ( the same appears to hold for complex nuclei as well @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the contribution from double rescattering term , e.g. the _ ternary collision term _",
    "@xcite amounts to @xmath133 of the leading order term , the single rescattering contribution .",
    "it is clear therefore that the double rescattreing contribution should be taken into account even at high momentum transfer region , such as @xmath158 several @xmath159 , which is the kinematical region considered in this paper .",
    "the effect of correlations and glauber fsi on the distorted momentum distributions appreciably depends upon the type of wave functions which are adopted to describe the ground state ; if ground - state correlations are completely absent , a situation which does not occur in nature , for real nuclei are strongly correlated systems , the whole high momentum content of the distorted momentum distributions is provided by fsi . however , if isc are considered , the role of fsi is appreciably suppressed ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : gr+fsi ] ) .",
    "we would like to stress , in this connection , that introducing fsi without , at the same time , considering isc , is a pure academic and misleading operation , for , we reiterate it once again , realistic nuclear wave functions contains a large amount of isc .",
    "the issue we addressed in the present paper was whether and to which extent the central jastrow correlations could mock up the realistic ones in the semi - inclusive process @xmath4 .",
    "according to our results , the answer is that , at high missing momenta , the jastrow and realistic approaches may differ by a factor of @xmath160 , in the parallel and antiparallel kinematics , whereas in perpendicular kinematics they do not appreciably differ ( cf .",
    "[ fig : comparison ] ) ; moreover , the jastrow approach always overestimates fsi by the same factor ( cf .",
    "[ fig : ratio ] ) .",
    "3 .   the effect of fsi dominates the high momentum component of the perpendicular distorted momentum distributions @xmath161 , though its magnitude is reduced if tensor - type correlations which induce the d - wave component in @xmath0he are taken into account .",
    "4 .   the parallel ( antiparallel )",
    "distorted momentum distributions @xmath162 are appreciably affected at medium and high momenta by fsi if uncorrelated or jastrow centrally correlated wave functions are adopted to describe the @xmath0he ground state ; if , however , the latter is described by ",
    "real \" four - body wave functions , featuring the correct high momentum content , the effects of fsi on the high momentum part of @xmath162 is , as already pointed out , reduced by a factor of @xmath160 ; nevertheless , a difference of about @xmath163 still persists between distorted and undistorted momentum distributions ; therefore , fsi ( as well as meson exchange currents , isobar configurations , etc . )",
    "have to be always carefully taken into account in the analysis of semi - inclusive processes , in order to infer whether different momentum distributions produced by different _",
    "realistic many body wave functions _ can be discriminated by measuring the _ distorted _ momentum distributions .",
    "the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath164 represents an interesting quantity even for the four - body system , due to its ability to filter out the s - wave component of the wave function .",
    "calculations of the distorted momentum distribution for complex nuclei , using a recently proposed approach to treat realistic isc within the glauber approach tp fsi , based on a linked cluster expansion @xcite @xcite are in progress and will be published elsewhere @xcite .",

    "<S> the contributions from n - n correlations and from glauber multiple scattering are taken into account exactly to all orders . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that non - central correlations significantly affect both the transparency and the distorted momentum distributions ; as a matter of fact : i ) the small ( @xmath2 ) value of the effect of correlations on the transparency results from an appreciable cancellation between the short - range central repulsive correlations and the intermediate - range attractive correlations , whose magnitude is significantly affected by the non - central forces , and ii ) the effect of glauber final state interactions on the momentum distribution is reduced by the inclusion of tensor correlations .    </S>",
