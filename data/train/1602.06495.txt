    "glueball is a hypothetical particle appearing in su(3 ) quantum gauge field theory only . roughly speaking",
    ", one can say that the glueball is a proton ( or a neutron ) with remote quarks .",
    "the existence of glueballs is a consequence of the self - interaction of gluons within qcd .",
    "fritzsch and minkowski  @xcite developed a model of glueball on the basis of the quark - gluon field theory by assuming an analogy between massless gluons and photons .",
    "jaffe and johnson  @xcite investigated the bag model of glueball . at the present time , several candidates for low - mass glueballs with quantum numbers @xmath3 and @xmath4 are under discussion  @xcite .    historically , the idea of studying qcd in the large - n limit was first put forward in 1974 by thooft  @xcite , who proposed to consider @xmath5 as an expansion parameter .",
    "some nonperturbative features of qcd can be understood in such a large-@xmath6 limit  @xcite .",
    "here we would like to calculate the mass of a glueball in su(n ) gauge theory by using the nonperturbative quantization technique  la heisenberg @xcite .",
    "the essence of such a technique consists in writing equation(s ) for field operator(s ) .",
    "in fact , such equation(s ) is(are ) equivalent to an infinite set of equations for all green functions  @xcite .",
    "mathematically , such procedure is similar to writing down of infinite system of equations for all cumulants in turbulence modeling @xcite .",
    "since it is impossible to solve such an infinite set of equations , one can proceed similarly to the case of turbulence modeling when one has to cut off the set of equations using some assumptions concerning green functions ( the closure problem ) .",
    "for example , this can be done by introducing some approximate connection between higher- and lower - order green functions .",
    "in addition , we will use the following assumptions : ( a ) 2-point green functions of su(n ) gauge potentials can approximately be expressed through scalar functions ; ( b ) 2-point green functions for the subgroup su(n ) and the coset su(n)/su(n ) are different .",
    "namely , we employ @xmath7 for su(n ) 2,4-point green functions and @xmath8 for su(n)/su(n ) coset 2,4-point green functions ; ( c ) there is an anisotropy in the color space in the sense that green functions are not symmetric under exchange of color indices .",
    "based on the above assumptions and ideas , we have the following approximate model of a glueball : ( a ) it is a ball filled with fluctuating su(n ) quantum gauge fields ; ( b ) quantum fields are approximately described by two scalar fields ; ( c ) one of the fields describes the fluctuating su(n ) components , and another one  the coset su(n)/su(n ) components ; ( d ) 2- and 4-point green functions are nonsymmetric in the color space under exchange of color indices ; ( e ) the approximate description of the glueball is therefore carried out by using nonlinear equations for two scalar fields ; ( f ) the glueball is described by spherically symmetric solutions of these equations ; ( g ) using the expression for the scalar fields energy density , we can calculate the mass of the glueball within this model ; ( h ) all components of the subgroup su(n ) give similar contributions to a green function ; the same holds true for the coset su(n)/su(n ) .",
    "it will be shown below that equations for the scalar fields contain parameters @xmath9 , describing the self - interaction of the scalar fields ( gauge potentials ) , and the value @xmath10 of one of the scalar fields at the origin ( dispersion of fluctuations of the gauge potentials ) .",
    "after fixing @xmath9 , one can show that the dimensionless glueball mass for su(n ) gauge field theory depends on the value of one scalar field at the origin and the dimensions of the subgroup su(n ) and the gauge group su(n ) : @xmath11 .",
    "our approximation is based on the main assumption that 2- and 4-points green functions are described in terms of some scalar fields @xmath8 and",
