    "different values of indirect exchange between the antiferromagnetic mn@xmath6 - mn@xmath7 ion pairs and considerably stronger double exchange between the ferromagnetic pairs of these ions lead to the exchange striction that breaks the centrosymmetricity of the lattice , thus giving rise to the ferroelectric polarization along the @xmath10 axis at @xmath23  @xcite .",

    "the field h oriented along the @xmath10 axis in gdmn@xmath0o@xmath1 also enhances the polarization induced by the restricted polar domains due to the increasing probability of charge transfer between @xmath137 ion pairs with the greatest distance between them ( see the caption to fig .",

    "<S> the electric polarization hysteresis loops and remanent polarization were revealed in multiferroics rmn@xmath0o@xmath1 with @xmath2 and @xmath3 at wide temperature interval from 5 k up to 330 k. until recently , the long - range ferroelectric order having an exchange - striction magnetic nature had been observed in rmn@xmath0o@xmath1 only at low temperatures ( @xmath4  35 k ) . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the polarization we observed was caused by the frozen superparaelectric state which was formed by the restricted polar domains resulting from phase separation and charge carriers self - organization . at some sufficiently high temperatures @xmath5 the frozen superparaelectric state </S>",
    "<S> was destroyed , and the conventional superparaelectric state occurred . </S>",
    "<S> this happened when the potential barriers of the restricted polar domain reorientations become equal to the kinetic energy of the itinerant electrons ( leakage ) . </S>",
    "<S> the hysteresis loops were measured by the so - called pund method which allowed us to correctly subtract the contribution of conductivity from the measured polarization . </S>",
    "<S> the correlations between properties of the phase separation domains and polarization were revealed and studied . </S>",
    "<S> the high - temperature polarization also had a magnetic nature and was controlled by the magnetic field because the double exchange between pairs of mn ions with different valences ( mn@xmath6 and mn@xmath7 ) in rmn@xmath0o@xmath1 was the basic interaction resulting in phase separation .    </S>",
