    "a variety @xmath6 of universal algebras is _ subtractive _ in the sense of a.ursini @xcite , if the theory of @xmath6 contains a binary term @xmath7 ( called a _ subtraction term _ ) and a nullary term @xmath8 , satisfying the identities @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "an example of a subtractive variety is the variety of ( additive ) groups , for which @xmath11 . more generally , any maltsev variety @xcite , whose theory contains a nullary term , is subtractive .",
    "an example of a subtractive variety , which is not a maltsev variety , is the variety of implication algebras @xcite .",
    "a _ subtraction algebra _ is a triple @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is a set , `` @xmath14 '' is a binary operation on @xmath13 , and @xmath8 is a nullary operation on @xmath13 , satisfying the axioms @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "a _ group _ can be defined as a subtraction algebra with the additional axiom @xmath17 , and an _ abelian group _ can be defined as a subtraction algebra with the stronger axiom @xmath18 in both cases , the group addition @xmath19 is defined by the equality @xmath20 , while the unary operation of taking the inverse @xmath21 of an element @xmath22 , is defined by the equality @xmath23 . note that , to require the axiom ( [ commutativity of subtraction ] ) , is the same as to require that the binary operation @xmath24 is a homomorphism of subtraction algebras .",
    "thus , an abelian group is a subtraction algebra whose algebraic structure is at the same time an internal subtraction structure in the category @xmath25 of all subtraction algebras .",
    "further , any internal subtraction structure on an object @xmath13 in @xmath25 , coincides with the underlying subtraction structure of @xmath13 ( see @xcite , @xcite , and `` subtraction '' is used only when @xmath13 is a group ; in @xcite ( and also in most cases in @xcite too ) , `` @xmath26 '' is written as `` @xmath27 '' , and accordingly , a `` ( proto)subtraction '' is called a `` ( proto)devision '' . ] ) , and so an internal subtraction algebra in @xmath25 is always an internal abelian group .",
    "the variety @xmath25 is clearly a subtractive variety .",
    "further , the algebraic theory of @xmath25 contains a unique nullary term ; equivalently , @xmath25 is a _ pointed category _ , i.e. the terminal object in @xmath25 coincides with the initial object .",
    "the notion of a subtractive category , introduced in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , extends the notion of a pointed subtractive variety to abstract pointed categories  a pointed variety is subtractive in the sense of ursini , if and only if it is a subtractive category .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that for a finitely complete pointed category , with binary sums , and such that each morphism @xmath2 in @xmath0 can be presented as a composite @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a monomorphism and @xmath5 is an epimorphism , we have the following result : @xmath0 is additive if and only if both @xmath0 and its dual @xmath1 are subtractive ( theorem [ thm : the main theorem ] ) .",
    "this implies that a barr exact @xcite pointed category @xmath0 , having binary sums , is an abelian category , if and only if both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are subtractive .",
    "in particular , for varieties of universal algebras ( which are always barr exact and have binary sums ) , we obtain : a pointed subtractive variety @xmath0 is abelian ( i.e. @xmath0 is the variety of modules over a fixed ring ) if and only if @xmath1 is also subtractive .",
    "let @xmath0 be a pointed category with binary products .",
    "@xmath0 is said to be subtractive , if for any object @xmath13 in @xmath0 , any subobject @xmath28 of @xmath29 satisfies the following condition : if there exist morphisms @xmath30 , such that both diagrams @xmath31 ^ -{r } & & & r\\ar[d]^-{r } \\\\a\\ar[r]_-{(1_a,1_a)}\\ar[ur]^-{f_1 } & a{\\times}a & & a\\ar[r]_-{(1_a,0)}\\ar[ur]^-{f_2 } & a{\\times}a}}\\ ] ] commute , then there exists a morphism @xmath32 , such that the diagram @xmath33 ^ -{r } \\\\a\\ar[r]_-{(0,1_a)}\\ar[ur]^-{f_3 } & a{\\times}a}}\\ ] ] commutes .",
    "the above condition on the subobject @xmath34 can be reformulated , using generalized elements , as follows : if @xmath35 and @xmath36 for all @xmath37 , then @xmath38 for all @xmath37 . as we know from @xcite , if @xmath0 has finite limits , then @xmath0 is subtractive if and only if the following condition is satisfied for any object @xmath13 in @xmath0 , and any subobject @xmath34 of @xmath29 : for all @xmath37,@xmath39 the condition ( [ implication i ] ) on @xmath34 states precisely that @xmath34 is ( regarded as a binary relation on @xmath13 ) _ @xmath40-closed _ in the sense of @xcite , where @xmath40 is the extended matrix @xmath41 of terms in the algebraic theory @xmath42 of pointed sets  @xmath8 is the unique constant of @xmath42 , while @xmath22 is an arbitrary variable of @xmath42 .",
    "note that this matrix directly arises from the system of equations @xmath43 which defines an operation of subtraction .",
    "in the present paper we write such matrices mostly in the transposed form @xmath44 _ @xmath34 is @xmath40-closed _ means that for any _ interpretation _ @xmath45 of @xmath40 , where @xmath37 and @xmath8 is the base point of @xmath13 , if the first two rows of @xmath46 belong to @xmath34 ( considered as generalized elements of @xmath47 ) , then also the third row ( i.e. the row below the horizontal line ) belongs to @xmath34 .",
    "thus , @xmath34 is @xmath40-closed if and only if the implication ( [ implication i ] ) is satisfied for all @xmath37 , as already said above .",
    "recall from @xcite , that if we take @xmath48 then , again , a ( finitely complete pointed ) category with @xmath40-closed relations is the same as a ( finitely complete ) subtractive category . if we further modify @xmath40 by adding to it columns of the form @xmath49 then again ( by proposition 1.7 of @xcite )",
    ", a subtractive category is the same as a pointed category in which every @xmath50-ary relation @xmath51 is @xmath40-closed , where now @xmath40 is the new matrix , and @xmath50 denotes the number of columns of @xmath40 .",
    "a _ semi - abelian category _ in the sense of g.janelidze , l.mrki , and w.tholen @xcite , is a pointed category @xmath0 satisfying the following conditions :      as shown in @xcite , a pointed variety of universal algebras is semi - abelian if and only if it is _ classically ideal determined _ in the sense of a.ursini @xcite ( this is the same as _ bit speciale _ in the sense of @xcite ) .",
    "the following equation for categories was obtained in @xcite : @xmath52 this equation says : a category @xmath0 is an abelian category if and only if both @xmath0 and its dual category @xmath1 are semi - abelian . from theorem",
    "[ thm : the main theorem ] below , it follows that , more generally , for any barr exact category with binary sums , we have ( see corollary [ cor : abelian categories ] , and see also remark [ rem : strongly unital categories ] ) : @xmath53 recall that a barr exact category @xmath0 is an abelian category if and only if it is additive , i.e. if and only if @xmath0 is enriched in the category of abelian groups  each object in @xmath0 is equipped with an internal abelian group structure , so that each morphism in @xmath0 is a homomorphism of internal abelian groups . more generally , we have :    [ lem : additivity via subtraction algebras ] a category with finite products is additive if and only if each object in it is equipped with an internal subtraction structure , so that each morphism is a homomorphism of internal subtraction algebras .",
    "this follows immediately from the definition of an additive category , and the known fact that if the operation of subtraction of a subtraction algebra is homomorphic , then the subtraction algebra becomes an abelian group .          if @xmath0 is additive , then it is subtractive .",
    "indeed , then for any pair of commutative diagrams ( [ dia : subtractivity a ] ) , we can form the third one ( [ dia : subtractivity b ] ) , by taking in it @xmath55 , where `` @xmath14 '' denotes the operation of subtraction on @xmath56 , induced by the operation of subtraction of the abelian group structure of @xmath34 .",
    "we will then have @xmath57 so the diagram ( [ dia : subtractivity b ] ) indeed commutes . on the other hand , if @xmath0 is additive , then so is @xmath1 , and hence @xmath1 is subtractive .",
    "this proves the first part of the theorem .",
    "assume now that both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are subtractive . according to lemma [ lem : additivity via subtraction algebras ] , to show that @xmath0 is additive , it suffices to show that each object @xmath13 in @xmath0 is equipped with an internal subtraction structure , @xmath12 , so that each morphism @xmath58 in @xmath0 is a homomorphism of ( internal ) subtraction algebras .",
    "let @xmath13 be an object in @xmath0 .",
    "then we can form a commutative diagram @xmath59 ^ -{r=(r_1,r_2 ) } & \\\\",

    "next , we regard @xmath34 as the subobject @xmath28 of @xmath47 . then @xmath63 becomes a partial binary operation on @xmath13 .",
    "commutativity of the two diagrams @xmath65 ^ -{r}\\\\ a \\ar[ur]^-{q_1}\\ar[r]_-{(1_a,1_a ) } & a{\\times}a\\\\ } { \\;\\;\\;}{\\;\\;\\;}{\\;\\;\\;}\\xymatrix@=3pc { & r\\ar[d]^-{r}\\\\ a \\ar[ur]^-{q_2}\\ar[r]_-{(1_a,0 ) } & a{\\times}a\\\\}\\ ] ] and the fact that @xmath0 is subtractive , yield that there exists a morphism @xmath66 such that the diagram @xmath65 ^ -{r}\\\\ a \\ar[ur]^-{p}\\ar[r]_-{(0,1_a ) } & a{\\times}a\\\\}\\ ] ] commutes . from the commutativity of the last four diagrams we obtain : for all @xmath37 , @xmath67 and , further , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "we now show @xmath70 .",
    "consider the ternary relation @xmath71 defined as follows : @xmath72 since @xmath0 is subtractive , @xmath73 is closed with respect to the matrix @xmath74 for each @xmath75 we then have : @xmath76 thus , for all @xmath75 , @xmath77 , which shows @xmath70 .",
    "so @xmath7 is a full binary operation on @xmath13 , and since we already know that it satisfies the identities @xmath68 and @xmath69 , we get that @xmath78 is a subtraction algebra .",
    "we have thus shown    * that the morphism @xmath60 is an isomorphism ; this implies that the morphism @xmath79_-{{\\fontsize{8}{9.2}\\selectfont\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}1_a & 1_a\\\\#3 & 0\\\\\\end{array}\\right ) } } & & a{\\times}a\\\\}\\ ] ] is an epimorphism ; * that there exists a subtraction algebra @xmath80 ; note that the subtraction axioms for the operation @xmath81 state precisely that the diagram @xmath82 ^ -{{\\fontsize{8}{9.2}\\selectfont\\left(\\begin{array}{c}0\\\\#2\\end{array}\\right)}}\\ar[rr]_-{{\\fontsize{8}{9.2}\\selectfont\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}1_a & 1_a\\\\#3 & 0\\\\\\end{array}\\right ) } } & & a{\\times}a\\ar[r]_-{- } & a\\\\}\\ ] ] commutes .",
    "now let @xmath83 be another subtraction algebra , obtained from an object @xmath84 , like @xmath80 is obtained from @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath2 be any morphism @xmath58 . in the diagram @xmath85_-{f+f}\\ar[rr]^-{{\\fontsize{8}{9.2}\\selectfont\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}1_a & 1_a\\\\#3 & 0\\\\\\end{array}\\right ) }",

    "since the first morphism in the top row is an epimorphism , this implies that the right inner rectangle commutes . we thus obtain that @xmath2 is a homomorphism @xmath86 of subtraction algebras .",
    "this concludes the proof .",
    "an ablian category is the same as an additive barr exact category . on the other hand , a barr exact category , being a regular category ,",
    "has finite limits and any morphism @xmath2 in it can be decomposed @xmath3 into a monomorphism @xmath4 and an epimorphism @xmath5 ( moreover , any morphism can be decomposed into a monomorphism and a regular epimorphism ) . after these observations",
    ", it is only left to apply theorem [ thm : the main theorem ] .",
    "[ rem : strongly unital categories ]",
    "i do not know if theorem [ thm : the main theorem ] remains true if @xmath0 in it does not have the property ( * ) .",
    "however , it does remain true if in addition we replace `` subtractive '' in the theorem with `` strongly unital '' in the sense of d.  bourn @xcite ; this is an immediate consequence of the following known facts ( see @xcite and @xcite ) :    * a finitely complete category is additive if and only if it is subtractive and enriched in the category of commutative monoids , * a category @xmath0 with binary sums and products is enriched in the category of commutative monoids if and only if both @xmath0 and its dual @xmath1 are unital in the sense of d.  bourn @xcite , * a finitely complete category is strongly unital if and only if it is subtractive and unital ."
