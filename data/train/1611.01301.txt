    "novae are powered by a thermonuclear runaway occurring at the base of an accreted layer at the surface of a white dwarf ( wd ) . a sub - class of the cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) ,",
    "novae occur in close binary systems where the wd accretes material from its companion , usually via an accretion disk around the wd .",
    "classical novae have been observed in eruption only once , whereas the recurrent novae ( rne ) have been detected erupting at least twice and have observed recurrence periods up to @xmath3years .",
    "such short recurrence periods are driven by the combination of a high mass wd and a high mass accretion rate ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent reviews ) .",
    "rne have long been a proposed single - degenerate pathway to supernovae typeia ( sneia ) , with recent works indicating that the wd mass in nova systems may indeed be growing over time ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the remarkable m31n2008 - 12a was first observed in eruption in 2008 @xcite . since then",
    ", eruptions have been discovered in each year , the most recent in 2015 august  indicating a mean recurrence period of @xmath4days @xcite . however , when archival x - ray detections of eruptions from 1992 , 1993 , and 2001 are also considered , there is strong evidence that the true recurrence period may be half as long , @xmath5days .    in this article",
    ", we review a number of the most interesting and unusual features of the m31n2008 - 12a system .",
    "however , we also refer the reader to the extensive published work on this system .",
    "with such a short recurrence period , the inference is that the wd in the m31n2008 - 12a system must be high , and probably the highest mass wd yet found in a cv .",
    "the rapid unveiling of the super - soft source ( sss ) x - ray emission after each eruption  just six days @xcite  points to a low ejected mass ; the short duration of the sss ( @xmath6 days ) again indicates a high mass wd .",
    "modelling of the 2013 eruption by @xcite suggested that @xmath7 and that the accretion rate must be @xmath8 .",
    "subsequent treatments by @xcite , using data from multiple eruptions and assuming a recurrence period of one year , are consistent with @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and a mass accumulation efficiency of @xmath11 .",
    "both the @xcite and @xcite works indicate that the wd in m31n2008 - 12a will reach the chandrasekhar mass ( @xmath12 ) in less than 1myr .    with the mass of the wd increasing , the ultimate fate of the system will therefore depend upon the underlying composition of that wd .",
    "an one wd will be expected to form a neutron star when @xmath12 is reached , only a co wd will explode as a snia .",
    "however , in either situation , m31n2008 - 12a is still of vital importance , being so close to @xmath12 it is either the leading candidate for either an accretion induced collapse or a snia .",
    "the recent work of @xcite has shown that a co wd can grow from its formation mass ( @xmath13 ) to @xmath12 via a long series of h - flashes ( novae ) interspersed with he - flashes ( he - novae ) with little or no tuning of the system parameters or accretion rate .",
    "that work , the discovery of m31n2008 - 12a , and recent rn population work @xcite has significantly strengthened the case for novae contributing to the snia progenitor population .",
    "the high mass accretion rates in rne are typically provided by either a roche lobe overflowing sub - giant , as in the u  scorpii system , or via the stellar wind of a red giant donor ( e.g.  rs  ophiuchi ; * ? ? ?",
    "using the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) @xcite and @xcite have shown that quiescent novae with red giant donors ( near - infrared observations ) or luminous accretion disks ( visible and near - ultraviolet ) can be directly imaged at the distance of m31 . both and @xcite reported the detection of m31n2008 - 12a at quiescence using archival hst observations .",
    "the sed obtained from those visible and nuv images indicated the presence of an extremely luminous accretion disk , however , the nir data were too crowded to usefully constrain the donor .",
    "although the eruptions of m31n2008 - 12a have been followed photometrically from peak back to quiescence @xcite , to date we have only been able to follow the eruptions spectroscopically for the first five days post - eruption . @xcite",
    "compiled the spectra from the 20122015 eruptions and derived the ejecta expansion velocity as a function of time since each eruption .",
    "this was conducted by using the fwhm of the h@xmath2 emission lines as a proxy of the expansion velocity in the radial direction to the observer .",
    "this analysis clearly indicated that the ejecta velocity decreased as a function of time with @xmath14 , consistent with phase  ii shock behaviour ( adiabatic expansion , e.g. * ? ? ? * ) as the m31n2008 - 12a ejecta interact with surrounding , pre - existing , and nearby material . with eruptions occurring regularly in the system",
    ", any such circumbinary material must be replenished in between each eruption .",
    "the majority of the spectra taken of m31n2008 - 12a to - date have been at low - resolution , as somewhat necessitated by the faintness and distance of the system .",
    "@xcite also presented a co - added spectrum combining all data from the 20122015 eruptions .",
    "this deep spectrum indicated the presence of coronal [ fevii ] , [ fex ] , and [ fexiv ] emission lines as are typically associated with shocks between a nova ejecta and surrounding material .",
    "the deep spectrum also contained an emission band at @xmath15  that is consistent with raman scattering of the ovi resonant doublet ( at 1032/1038 ) .",
    "such raman scattered features are common in the spectra of symbiotic stars .    together ,",
    "the combination of the spectral line development , the coronal emission lines , the raman emission band , and also the photometric behaviour of each eruption ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , provide compelling evidence as to the nature of the mass donor in the system  all pointing to a red giant , and wind accretion .",
    "this in itself poses an intriguing thought , with the orbital period of novae with red giant donors being of order a year @xcite , m31n2008 - 12a is the only known nova whose orbital period is approximately the same as its recurrence period .",
    "@xcite have recently indicated that the red giant donor in the rs  oph system may be tidally locked to its wd and hence the orbits circularised . any deviation from circular orbits in the m31n2008 - 12a system",
    "however , may lead to an accretion rate , and hence inter eruption interval , that is affected by the orbital phase .",
    "@xcite also discussed the accretion disk around the wd , and considered the possibility that the disk survives each eruption . with a short inter eruption period",
    "it is fair to assume that accretion must begin shortly after each eruption .",
    "@xcite argued that the formation timescale of an accretion disk must be at least one orbital period of the system .",
    "therefore , with a red giant donor , and the recurrence period in m31n2008 - 12a of order the orbital period , it seems unlikely that the disk seen in the hst observations could re - form in such a short timescale  therefore the disk must survive .",
    "the accretion disk , and its survival , will be discussed in further detail in @xcite .",
    "with one or even two eruptions every year since at least the early 1990s , the search is on to recover some of the missing eruptions .",
    "these efforts led to the discovery of extended h@xmath2 emission around the nova within archival steward observatory @xcite and local group galaxies survey data @xcite . to confirm this emission ,",
    "a series of deep h@xmath2 observations were taken by the liverpool telescope ( lt ; * ? ? ?",
    "those observations uncovered a shell - like elliptical nebula centred on the position of the nova .",
    "the nebula itself is vast , measuring over 130 pc along the major axis and 90 pc across the minor axis , and is somewhat larger than the majority of galactic sn remnants .",
    "a spectrum of the south - western ` knot ' ( see figure  [ fig1 ] ) was serendipitously obtained by the long slit of the sprat @xcite instrument on the lt during the 2015 eruption .",
    "that spectrum revealed only three sets of emission lines , h@xmath2 , [ nii ] ( 6548/6584 ) , and [ sii ] ( 6716/6731 ) , no [ oiii ] emission was detected in the spectrum nor in narrow - band imaging @xcite .",
    "the [ sii]/h@xmath2 ratio of 0.35 is inconclusive as to the nature of the nebula , but the [ sii ] doublet line ratio indicates an electron density that is consistent with the nebula mass being dominated by the ism swept up from within the shell .    proposed that the extended nebulosity is the ` super - remnant ' of many thousands of past eruptions from m31n2008 - 12a .",
    "hydrodynamic simulations of the formation of such a phenomena are underway , support this hypothesis , and will be reported in a follow - up paper @xcite .",
    "ten orbits of hst cycle  24 time has been awarded to study the structure and possible formation pathway of the super remnant , with observations due to be taken in 2016 december .",
    "based on the times of the last eleven observed eruptions , @xcite predicted that the next observable eruption of m31n2008 - 12a will take place between 2016 august 21 and october 13 ( @xmath16 range ) .",
    "a global network of observers has been established to detect this eruption in order to ensure early discovery and the triggering of follow - up observations . at the time of writing ( 2016 october 13 ) , this window has now passed without an eruption .",
    "when the next eruption is detected , a range of follow - up programmes will be triggered including late time spectroscopy ( beyond the 5 day limit so far achieved ) .",
    "these include observations from gemini north , gran telescopio canarias ( gtc ) , hobby eberly telescope ( het ) , and the large binocular telescope ( lbt ) .",
    "in addition to late time spectroscopy of the eruption , they will each obtain deep spectra of the proposed super - remnant , and will attempt spectroscopy at quiescence ( a first beyond the galaxy and magellanic clouds ) .",
    "m31n2008 - 12a is a truly remarkable system , with observed eruptions yearly and a possible six months recurrence period .",
    "the wd in the system is close to the chandrasekhar mass limit , the accretion rate is high , most likely fed by the stellar wind of a red giant , and the accretion disk appears to survive each eruption .",
    "the system is also surrounded by a huge region of extended nebulosity , which has been proposed to be the super - remnant of many thousands of past eruptions .",
    "the one big outstanding question is the composition of the wd itself , but nevertheless m31n2008 - 12a has become the leading pre - explosion snia progenitor candidate .",
    "if confirmed , the super - remnant phenomena may exist around all rne and could provide an invaluable ` sign post ' around exploding sneia pointing directly to the progenitor type .",
    "this article is presented on behalf of the ` 12a ' collaboration .",
    "m.j.d . would like to particularly thank martin henze for his invaluable help in our on - going campaigns with this remarkable system , and also the loc and soc for organising such a wonderful workshop .                                                              , p.  a. , & ribeiro , v.  a.  r.  m.
