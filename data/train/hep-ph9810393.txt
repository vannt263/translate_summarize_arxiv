    "the propagation of quarks and leptons in a medium of high temperature and/or density is of fundamental importance in a wide variety of physically relevant situations . in stellar astrophysics , electrons and neutrinos play a major role in the evolution of dense stars such as white dwarfs , neutron stars and supernovae  @xcite . in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions and the possibility of formation of a quark - gluon plasma , electrons ( and muons )",
    "play a very important role as clean probes of the early , hot stage of the plasma  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , medium effects can enhance neutrino oscillations as envisaged in the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) effect  @xcite and dramatically modify the neutrino electromagnetic couplings  @xcite .",
    "the propagation of quarks during the non - equilibrium stages of the electroweak phase transition is conjectured to be an essential ingredient for baryogenesis at the electroweak scale both in non - supersymmetric and supersymmetric extensions of the standard model  @xcite .    in - medium",
    "propagation is dramatically different from that in vacuum .",
    "the medium modifies the dispersion relation of the excitations and introduces a width to the propagating excitation  @xcite that results in damping of the amplitude of the propagating mode . in this article",
    "we focus on several aspects of propagation of fermionic excitations in a fermion - scalar plasma :    * we begin by deriving the effective and fully renormalized dirac equation _ in real time_. this is achieved by relating the expectation value of a fermionic field induced by an external fermionic source via linear response to an initial value problem for the expectation value .",
    "this initial value problem is in terms of the effective real time dirac equation in the medium that is i ) renormalized , ii ) retarded and causal .",
    "+ the necessity for a consistent dirac equation in a medium has been recognized in the literature within the context of neutrino oscillations in the medium  @xcite . in particular , in references  @xcite a proposal for a field - theoretical treatment of neutrino oscillations in the medium starting from the dirac equation was presented .",
    "+ in this article we introduce the fully renormalized , in - medium effective dirac equation in _ real time _ that allows a more transparent study of damping and oscillations in time .",
    "there are definite advantages in such formulation since the real time evolution is obtained at once from an initial value problem and allows a straightforward identification of the damping rate .",
    "* we apply the effective dirac equation in a medium to study the real - time evolution of fermionic excitations in a fermion - scalar plasma . whereas the propagation of quarks and leptons in a qed or qcd plasma has been studied thoroughly ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) a similar study for a scalar plasma has not been carried out to the same level of detail .",
    "recently some attention has been given to understanding the thermalization time scales of bosonic and fermionic excitations in a plasma of gauge  @xcite and scalar bosons  @xcite , furthermore fermion thermalization is an important ingredient in models of baryogenesis mediated by scalars  @xcite .",
    "most of the studies of fermion thermalization focus on the mechanism of fermion scattering off the gauge quanta in the heat bath and/or landau damping in the hard thermal loop ( htl ) resummation program  @xcite .",
    "although the scalar contribution to the fermionic self - energy to one loop has been obtained a long time ago  @xcite , scant attention has been paid to a more detailed understanding of the contribution from the scalar degrees of freedom to the fermion relaxation and thermalization . as mentioned above this issue",
    "becomes of pressing importance in models of baryogenesis and more so in models in which the scalars carry baryon number  @xcite .",
    "+ whereas the contribution from scalars to the fermionic thermalization time scale ( damping rate ) has been studied for massless chiral fermions  @xcite , in this article we offer a detailed and general study of fermion relaxation and thermalization through the interactions with the scalars in the plasma in real time and for arbitrary values of the scalar and fermion masses , temperature and fermion momentum .",
    "more importantly , we focus on a novel mechanism of damping of fermionic excitations that occurs whenever the effective mass of the scalar particle allows its kinematic _ decay _ into fermion pairs .",
    "this phenomenon only occurs in a medium and is interpreted as an induced decay of the scalar in the medium .",
    "it is a process different from collisions with particles in the bath and landau damping which are the most common processes that lead to relaxation and thermalization .",
    "+ this process results in new thermal cuts in the fermionic self - energy and for heavy scalars , this cut results in a quasiparticle pole structure for the fermion and provides a width for the fermionic quasiparticle .",
    "the remarkable and perhaps non - intuitive aspect of this process is that the decay of the scalar results in _ damping _ of the fermionic excitations and their propagation as quasiparticle resonances .",
    "our real time analysis reveals that amplitude of the @xmath0-mode of the expectation value of the fermion field decreases as @xmath1 while it oscillates with frequency @xmath2 which is determined by the position of the resonance .",
    "+ the effective real - time dirac equation in the medium allows a direct interpretation of the damping of the quasiparticle fermionic excitation and leads to a clear definition of the damping rate . by analyzing the quasiparticle wave functions we obtain an _ all - order _ expression for the damping rate @xmath3 and confirm and generalize recent results for the massless chiral case  @xcite . * in order to provide a complementary understanding of the process of induced decay of the heavy scalars in the medium and the resulting fermion damping , we study the kinetics of relaxation of the fermionic distribution function via a boltzmann equation to lowest order . linearizing the boltzmann equation near the equilibrium distribution , we obtain the relation between the thermalization rate for the distribution function in the relaxation time approximation ( linearized near equilibrium ) and the damping rate for the amplitude of the fermionic mean fields to lowest order in the yukawa coupling .",
    "this analysis provides a real - time confirmation of the oft quoted relation between the interaction rate ( obtained from the boltzmann kinetic equation in the relaxation time approximation ) and the damping rate for the mean field  @xcite .",
    "more importantly , this analysis reveals directly , via a kinetic approach in real time how the process of induced decay of a heavy scalar in the medium results in damping and thermalization of the fermionic excitations . a study of the relation between the interaction rate and the damping rate has been presented recently for gauge theories within the context of the imaginary time formulation  @xcite .",
    "our results provide a real - time confirmation of those of reference  @xcite for the scalar case .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section ii we obtain the effective in - medium dirac equation in real time starting from the linear response to an external grassmann - valued source that induces a mean field .",
    "we obtain the _ fully renormalized _ dirac equation with the real time self - energy to one loop order by turning the linear response problem into an initial value problem for the mean field .",
    "the renormalization aspects are addressed in detail in this section . in section iii",
    "we study in detail the structure of the renormalized self - energy and establish the presence of new cuts of thermal origin .",
    "we then note that for heavy scalars such that their decay into fermion pairs is kinematically allowed , the fermionic pole becomes embedded in this thermal cut resulting in a quasiparticle ( resonance ) structure , which is analyzed in detail .",
    "the decay rate is evaluated in the narrow width approximation ( justified for small yukawa couplings ) for _ arbitrary values _ of the scalar and fermion masses , temperature and fermion momentum .    in section",
    "iv we present a real time analysis of the evolution of the mean - fields . in this section",
    "we clarify the difference between complex poles and resonances ( often misunderstood ) .",
    "this analysis reveals clearly that the induced decay of the scalar results in an exponential damping of the amplitude of the mean field and yields to a clear identification of the damping rate bypassing the conflicting definitions of the damping rate offered in the literature .",
    "an analysis of the structure of the self - energy and an interpretation of the _ exact _ quasiparticle spinor wave functions allows us to provide an _ all - order _",
    "expression for the damping rate of the fermionic mean fields . in section",
    "v we present an analysis of the evolution of the distribution functions in real time by obtaining a boltzmann kinetic equation for the spin - averaged fermionic distribution function . in the linearized approximation near equilibrium ( relaxation time approximation ) , we clarify to lowest order the relation between the damping rate of the quasiparticle fermionic excitations and the thermalization rate ( linearized ) of the distribution function , directly in real time . in the conclusions",
    "we summarize our results and suggest new avenues including the contribution from gauge fields . in this section",
    "we also assess the importance of the scalar contribution in theories with gauge and scalar fields .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , whereas the damping of collective and quasiparticle excitations via the interactions with gauge bosons in the medium has been the focus of most attention , understanding of the influence of scalars has not been pursued so vigorously .",
    "although we are ultimately interested in studying the damping of fermionic excitations in a plasma with scalars and gauge fields within the realm of electroweak baryogenesis in either the standard model or generalizations thereof , we will begin by considering only the coupling of a massive dirac fermion to a scalar via a simple yukawa interaction .",
    "the model dependent generalizations of the yukawa couplings to particular cases will differ quantitatively in the details of the group structure but the qualitative features of the effective dirac equation in the medium as well as the kinematics of the thermal cuts that lead to damping of the fermionic excitations will be rather general .",
    "we consider a dirac fermion with the bare mass @xmath4 coupled to a scalar with the bare mass @xmath5 via a yukawa coupling",
    ". the bare fermion mass could be the result of spontaneous symmetry breaking in the scalar sector , but for the purposes of our studies we need not specify its origin .    the lagrangian density is given by @xmath6 - y_0\\bar{\\psi}\\phi\\psi+\\bar{\\eta}\\psi+\\bar{\\psi}\\eta+j\\phi~ , \\label{yukalan}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is the bare yukawa coupling .",

    "the dynamics of expectation values and correlation functions of the quantum field is obtained by implementing the schwinger - keldysh closed - time - path formulation of non - equilibrium quantum field theory  @xcite .",
    "the main ingredient in this formulation is the _ real _ time evolution of an initially prepared density matrix and its path integral representation .",
    "it requires a path integral defined along a closed time path contour .",
    "this formulation has been described elsewhere within many different contexts and we refer the reader to the literature for details  @xcite .",
    "our goal is to understand the non - equilibrium relaxational dynamics of the inhomogeneous fermionic mean fields @xmath22 from their initial states in the presence of the fermion - scalar medium .",
    "this statement requires clarification . in states of definite fermion number ( either zero or finite temperature )",
    "the expectation value of the fermion field must necessarily vanish .",
    "however , in order to understand the non - equilibrium dynamics , we prepare the system by coupling an external grassman source to the fermionic field in the hamiltonian .",
    "this source creates a coherent state of fermions which is a superposition of states with different fermion number .",
    "as will be discussed in detail below , this source term is switched - on adiabatically from @xmath23 in the _ full interacting theory _ up to a time @xmath24 and switched - off at @xmath25 .",

    "this is the standard approach to linear response , in this approach the source term couples to a given mode of wavevector @xmath26 of the fermionic fields , thus displacing this degree of freedom off - equilibrium .",
    "the other modes are assumed to be remain in thermal equilibrium .",
    "since we are interested in real time correlation functions and the initial density matrix is assumed to be that of thermal equilibrium at initial temperature @xmath27 with respect to the free ( quadratic ) lagrangian , only the real time branches , forward and backwards are required . the contribution from the imaginary time branch corresponding to",

    "<S> in this article we study the dynamics of fermions in a fermion - scalar plasma . </S>",
    "<S> we begin by obtaining the effective in - medium dirac equation in real time which is fully renormalized and causal and leads to the initial value problem . for a heavy scalar </S>",
    "<S> we find the novel result that the _ decay _ of the scalar into fermion pairs in the medium leads to damping of the fermionic excitations and their in - medium propagation as quasiparticles . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the fermions acquire a width due to the decay of the heavier scalar in the medium . </S>",
    "<S> we find the damping rate to lowest order in the yukawa coupling for arbitrary values of scalar and fermion masses , temperature and fermion momentum . </S>",
    "<S> an all - order expression for the damping rate in terms of the exact quasiparticle wave functions is established . a kinetic boltzmann approach to the relaxation of the fermionic distribution function </S>",
    "<S> confirms the damping of fermionic excitations as a consequence of the induced decay of heavy scalars in the medium . </S>",
    "<S> a linearization of the boltzmann equation near equilibrium clearly displays the relationship between the damping rate of fermionic mean fields and the fermion interaction rate to lowest order in the yukawa coupling directly in real time . </S>"
