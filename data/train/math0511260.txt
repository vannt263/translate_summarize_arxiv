    "in this section , we explain how the algebraic results from the preceding sections can be used in the topological setting .",
    "actually these applications were our original motivation to study the work of haddi and zusmanovich .",

    "the relation between the space @xmath626 and the space of all linear maps from @xmath627 is more complicated than in the algebraic setup ( @xcite ) . to define the topological version of @xmath27",
    ", we have to use the closure of @xmath11 to obtain a hausdorff topology on the quotient space .",
    "we always have a natural map @xmath628 but in general there is no reason for this map to be injective or surjective .",
    "therefore the homology space is much less interesting in the topological setting , and it often is easier to work directly with cocycles and coboundaries which is made possible by our results in section  iii .    the flip involution on @xmath629 , endowed with the projective tensor product topology , is continuous , so that the kernel of the quotient map @xmath630 is closed , which leads to a locally convex topology on @xmath42 .",
    "further the bracket map @xmath352 is continuous because it is induced from the continuous bracket map , which shows that its kernel @xmath13 is closed .",
    "one easily verifies that the maps @xmath223 and @xmath631 from section  2 are continuous , and likewise that the maps @xmath632 are continuous .",

    "finally , the surjectivity of @xmath424 follows from the fact that @xmath658 and @xmath659 can be chosen as continuous maps , because of the existence of ( continuous ) linear right inverses of surjective linear maps to finite dimensional vector spaces .",
