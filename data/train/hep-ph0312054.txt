    "although traditionally centered around deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) and structure functions , this conference series has become one of the prominent places to discuss strong interaction physics in a wider sense . in the heavy flavour case in particular ,",
    "the focus is on understanding in a common qcd framework the charm , beauty and top cross sections in various production environments .",
    "the experimental results reported in this session were obtained in @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath0 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 collisions . only a personal and biased selection from them can be mentioned in this summary . since the status of heavy flavour physics at hera has been well covered in the introductory talk  @xcite , the emphasis is here on new results and on other machines .",
    "the theoretical results presented in this session capture various recent developments in the area of inclusive charmonium , open - charm , and open - bottom production , as well as the heavy - flavour contributions to the structure functions @xcite .",
    "since the discovery of the @xmath7 meson in 1974 , heavy quarkonium has provided a useful laboratory for quantitative tests of qcd and , in particular , of the interplay of perturbative and nonperturbative phenomena .",
    "the factorization formalism of nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite provides a rigorous theoretical framework for the description of heavy - quarkonium production and decay .",
    "this formalism implies a separation of short - distance coefficients , which can be calculated perturbatively as expansions in the strong - coupling constant @xmath8 , from long - distance matrix elements ( mes ) , which must be extracted from experiment .",
    "the relative importance of the latter can be estimated by means of velocity scaling rules ; i.e. , the mes are predicted to scale with a definite power of the heavy - quark ( @xmath9 ) velocity @xmath10 in the limit @xmath11 . in this way ,",
    "the theoretical predictions are organized as double expansions in @xmath8 and @xmath10 .",
    "a crucial feature of this formalism is that it takes into account the complete structure of the @xmath12 fock space , which is spanned by the states @xmath13 with definite spin @xmath14 , orbital angular momentum @xmath15 , total angular momentum @xmath16 , and color multiplicity @xmath17 .",
    "in particular , this formalism predicts the existence of color - octet ( co ) processes in nature .",
    "this means that @xmath12 pairs are produced at short distances in co states and subsequently evolve into physical , color - singlet ( cs ) quarkonia by the nonperturbative emission of soft gluons . in the limit @xmath18 , the traditional cs model ( csm ) @xcite is recovered .",
    "the greatest triumph of this formalism was that it was able to correctly describe @xcite the cross section of @xmath19 at the tevatron @xcite , which had turned out to be more than one order of magnitude in excess of the theoretical prediction based on the csm .",
    "apart from this phenomenological drawback , the csm also suffers from severe conceptual problems indicating that it is incomplete .",
    "these include the presence of logarithmic infrared divergences in the @xmath20 corrections to @xmath21-wave decays to light hadrons and in the relativistic corrections to @xmath14-wave annihilation @xcite , and the lack of a general argument for its validity in higher orders of perturbation theory . in the case of @xmath22 in photoproduction , where next - to - leading ( nlo ) corrections in the csm happen to be well defined @xcite , the nlo prediction encompasses the rather precise hera data @xcite within the theoretical uncertainties .    in order to convincingly establish the phenomenological significance of the co processes , it is indispensable to identify them in other kinds of high - energy experiments as well , using the very mes extracted from the tevatron data @xcite .",
    "attempts to do so range from very successful to inconclusive for the time being .",
    "successful examples include the comparison of theoretical predictions of @xmath23 @xcite and @xmath24 @xcite with data taken by delphi @xcite at lep2 and by phenix @xcite at rhic , respectively .",
    "comparison of hera @xcite data of @xmath25 in dis with nrqcd predictions @xcite are generally favourable with respect to both normalization and shape , except for the distribution in inelasticity @xmath26 , where a shape problem familiar from photoproduction @xcite is recovered . as for the @xmath7 polarization in @xmath19 ,",
    "measurements at the tevatron @xcite tend to undershoot the theoretical predictions for direct @xcite and prompt @xcite production in the bins of highest transverse momentum ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "while the @xmath28-factorization @xcite and hard - comover - scattering @xcite approaches manage to bring the csm prediction of @xmath19 much closer to the tevatron data @xcite , they do not cure the conceptual defects of the csm ; nrqcd is still needed for that .",
    "however , they reduce the relative importance of the co contributions at leading order ( lo ) . since nlo corrections allow for an incoming parton to gain a @xmath28 kick by emitting another parton before entering the hard scattering , one expects @xmath28-factorization effects to become much less important at nlo .",
    "while the evaluation of nlo corrections is well understood in nrqcd , the extension of the @xmath28-factorization formalism beyond lo is an open problem .",
    "the list of open problems in connection with the @xmath28-factorization formalism also includes the determination of the proper evolution equation ( bfkl , ccfm , dglap , or mixtures thereof ) , the establishment of a rigorous operator definition of the unintegrated parton density functions , the restoration of gauge independence for off - shell external partons , the avoidance of ad - hoc regularization to keep propagators away from poles , which are sometimes used in the literature @xcite , and the recovery of the collinear - parton - model results for asymptotically large values of @xmath27 in practical applications @xcite .",
    "the color evaporation model @xcite provides an operative procedure to estimate the production cross sections of heavy quarkonia on the basis of the ones of open heavy - quark pairs .",
    "it is intuitive and useful for qualitative studies , and it also significantly improves the description of the tevatron data as compared to the csm @xcite .",
    "however , it does not account for the process - specific weights of the cs and co contributions , but rather assumes a fixed ratio of @xmath29 .",
    "the analysis of inelastic @xmath7 production with hera i data is essentially completed . at this meeting",
    ", zeus presented preliminary cross section results for charmonium production in dis  @xcite which confirm last year s h1 findings , namely that nrqcd with sizeable co contributions reproduces the data reasonably well , in particular at higher @xmath27 .",
    "however , the dependence on the inelasticity variable @xmath26 remains at variance with the calculations also in the new zeus data .",
    "new experimental testing grounds may provide further clues to clarify the validity of the nrqcd factorization approach .",
    "in addition to the @xmath5 collision results  @xcite ( sec .  [ sec : oniumtheo ] ) , data on charmonium production measured by hera - b , at the b factories in the @xmath6 continuum , or at the tevatron in the low @xmath27 regime are entering the stage .",
    "the hera - b collaboration has published a first measurement of @xmath30 , the fraction of @xmath7 mesons produced via intermediate @xmath31 states , which lies considerably below csm expectations , but matches the nrqcd predictions well  @xcite .",
    "the total statistics of about 3000000 @xmath7 and 20000 @xmath31 mesons produced on different nuclear targets allows them , for example , to measure the cross section dependence on isotope number @xmath32 . in nrqcd",
    "this is not the same for @xmath7 and @xmath31 , since cs and co pre - resonant states contribute with different strength and interact differently with nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "a measurement of the @xmath32 dependence of the @xmath31 cross section also forms an important ingredient for the interpretation of heavy ion collision data .",
    "a rather new testing field is charmonium production in the @xmath6 annihilation continuum below the @xmath33 resonance  @xcite .",
    "the cross section was found to be more than an order of magnitude higher than expected , but the momentum spectrum does not exhibit an enhancement at large momenta , which would signal strong co contributions . according to the preliminary belle results , @xmath34 of the @xmath7 mesons",
    "are accompanied by another pair of charm quarks .",
    "the @xmath7 recoil mass spectrum , measured now in a sample corresponding to 101 pb@xmath35 and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : psipsi ] , exhibits several clear @xmath36 resonances .",
    "( 10,7)(0,0 )    from these data , rates for many exclusive ( double ) charmonium modes were be measured , or earlier measurements confirmed with better precision ; in addition all exclusive open charm ground states have been observed recoiling against @xmath7 mesons .",
    "new possibilities also open up in familiar environments .",
    "the tevatron experiments are vigorously entering back on stage with new data from run ii . by the time of the dis conference , cdf , for example ,",
    "wrote 150  pb@xmath35 to tape and presented analyses making use of about 70  pb@xmath35 , to be compared to the run i data set corresponding to 110  pb@xmath35 . with their upgraded detector , trigger and data acquisition systems",
    "kinematic ranges and channels can be probed which have been inaccessible so far in highest energy @xmath37 collisions  @xcite .",
    "one example are lowered dimuon trigger thresholds which allow to trigger on @xmath38 mesons decaying at rest and thus to measure their production cross section over the entire momentum range down to @xmath39 .",
    "the existing measurements of run i start at @xmath40  gev and cover less than 10% of the total cross section .",
    "this allows one to test the nrqcd description over a wider range ; it provides increased sensitivity to those co mes ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) which also govern @xmath7 production at hera and should enable more stringent tests of their universality .",
    "however , a complete picture and a meaningful statement on the validity of the nrqcd factorization approach will only emerge once the nlo corrections , which are shown to be important in the hera photoproduction case , become available for hadroproduction as well .",
    "this requires a huge effort on the theoretical side , which should bear fruit in the not so far future .",
    "the qcd - improved parton model implemented in the @xmath43 renormalization and factorization scheme and endowed with nonperturbative fragmentation functions ( ffs ) , which proved itself so convincingly for light - meson inclusive production @xcite , also provides an ideal theoretical framework for a coherent global analysis of @xmath44- @xcite and @xmath45-meson data @xcite , provided that @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the energy scale characteristic for the respective production process and @xmath48 .",
    "then , at lo ( nlo ) , the dominant logarithmic terms , of the form @xmath49 with @xmath50 , are properly resummed to all orders by the dglap evolution , while power terms of the form @xmath51 are negligibly small and can be safely neglected . in this _ massless - quark scheme _ or _ zero - mass variable - flavour - number scheme _ ( zmvfns ) , which is sometimes quite wrongly referred to as _ nll approximation _",
    ", are fully included , except for terms that are suppressed by powers of @xmath51 . ]",
    "the @xmath9 quark is treated as massless and appears as an active parton in the incoming hadron or photon , having a nonperturbative parton density function .",
    "the criterion @xmath46 is certainly satisfied for @xmath52 annihilation on the @xmath53-boson resonance , and for the photo- , lepto- , and hadroproduction of @xmath44 and @xmath45 mesons with @xmath54 .",
    "furthermore , the universality of the ffs is guaranteed by the factorization theorem @xcite , which entitles us to transfer information on how @xmath55 and @xmath56 quarks hadronize to @xmath44 and @xmath45 mesons , respectively , in a well - defined quantitative way from @xmath52 annihilation , where the measurements are usually most precise , to other kinds of experiments , such as photo- , lepto- , and hadroproduction . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the distributions in the scaled @xmath44- and @xmath45-meson energy @xmath57 measured at lep1 were fitted at lo and nlo using , among others , the ansatz by peterson et al .",
    "@xcite for the @xmath58 and @xmath59 ff at the starting scale @xmath60 . in the @xmath61 ( @xmath62 )",
    "case , the @xmath63 parameter was found to be @xmath64 and @xmath65 @xcite ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 @xcite ) at lo and nlo , respectively .",
    "we emphasize that the value of @xmath63 carries no meaning by itself , but it depends on the underlying theory for the description of the fragmentation process , in particular , on the choice of the starting scale @xmath68 , on whether the analysis is performed in lo or nlo , and on how the final - state collinear singularities are factorized in nlo .    in the traditional _ massive - quark scheme",
    "_ or _ fixed - flavour - number scheme _",
    "( ffns ) , the @xmath9 quark is treated in the on - mass - shell renormalization scheme , as if it were a massive lepton in triplicate , and it only appears in the final state , but not as an active parton inside the incoming hadron or photon .",
    "there are no collinear singularities associated with the outgoing @xmath9-quark lines that need to be subtracted and absorbed into ffs .",
    "in fact , in this scheme , there is no conceptual necessity for ffs at all , but they are nevertheless introduced in an ad - hoc fashion in an attempt to match the @xmath44- and @xmath45-meson data .",
    "however , in the absence of a subtraction procedure , there is also no factorization theorem in operation to guarantee the universality of the ffs @xcite . by the same token ,",
    "such ffs are not subject to dglap evolution .",
    "thus , there is no theoretical justification to expect , e.g. , that a single value of the peterson @xmath63 parameter should be appropriate for different types of experiment or at different energy scales in the same type of experiment . in other words ,",
    "the feasibility of global data analyses is questionable in this scheme .",
    "moreover , this scheme breaks down for @xmath54 because of would - be collinear singularities of the form @xmath69 , which are not resummed .",
    "however , it allows one to calculate a total cross section , which is infeasible in the zmvfns .",
    "the attempt to split the @xmath44- and @xmath45-meson ffs into so - called perturbative ffs ( pffs ) and nonperturbative remainders is interesting in its own right .",
    "however , detailed analysis for @xmath70-meson ffs @xcite revealed that such a procedure leads to deficient results in practical applications . on the one hand , at nlo , the cross section @xmath71 of @xmath52 annihilation becomes negative in the upper @xmath72 range , at @xmath73 , where the data is very precise , so that a low - quality fit is obtained unless this @xmath72 range is excluded by hand @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the lo and nlo predictions for other types of processes , such as photoproduction in @xmath3 scattering , significantly differ @xcite , which implies that the perturbative stability might be insufficient",
    ".    the idea @xcite of performing a coherent analysis of lep1 and tevatron data of inclusive @xmath45-meson production was recently revived using an unconventional scheme named _ fixed - order next - to - leading - logarithm _ ( fonll ) scheme , in which the traditional result in the ffns and a suitably subtracted result in a zmvfns with pffs are linearly combined @xcite .",
    "however , some degree of arbitrariness is inherent to this procedure , as may be understood by noticing that the zmvfns term is weighted with an ad - hoc coefficient function of the form @xmath74 so as to effectuate its suppression in the low-@xmath27 range and that this term is evaluated at @xmath75 while the ffns term is evaluated at @xmath27 . since the fonll scheme interpolates between the ffns and the zmvfns with pffs",
    ", it also inherits some weaknesses of both schemes detailed above .",
    "in particular , the negativity of the nlo cross section of @xmath76 in the upper @xmath72 range forces one to exclude the data points located there from the fit . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this is achieved by resorting to what is called there the _ moments method _ ,",
    "i.e. , the large-@xmath72 region is manually faded out by selecting one particular low moment of the ff , namely the one corresponding to the average @xmath72 value , thereby leaving the residual information encoded in the data unused .    a rigorous theoretical framework that retains the full finite-@xmath77 effects while preserving the indispensible virtues of the factorization theorem , namely the universality and the dglap scaling violation of the ffs , is provided by the _ general - mass variable - flavour - number scheme _ ( gmvfns ) @xcite . in a nut shell ,",
    "this procedure consists in explicitly performing the @xmath78 limit of the ffns result , comparing the outcome , term by term , with the zmvfns result in the @xmath43 scheme , and subtracting the difference terms from the ffns result . owing to the factorization theorem @xcite , the hard - scattering cross sections thus obtained can then be convoluted with nonperturbative @xmath44- and @xmath45-meson ffs extracted from lep1 data using the @xmath43 scheme @xcite .",
    "this is consistent because the finite-@xmath77 terms omitted in refs .",
    "@xcite are negligibly small , of order @xmath79 .",
    "in fact , a reanalysis of the lep1 data in the gmvfns should yield ffs that agree with the ffs of refs .",
    "@xcite within the errors .",
    "the gmvfns was recently implemented for direct @xcite and single - resolved @xcite @xmath5 collisions . in the case of @xmath80 at lep2",
    ", the inclusion of finite-@xmath81 effects was found to reduce the cross section by approximately 20% ( 10% ) at @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) @xcite , i.e. , their magnitude is roughly @xmath84 , as navely expected . by analogy , one expects the finite-@xmath85 terms neglected in ref .",
    "@xcite to have a moderate size , of order 20% ( 10% ) at @xmath86  gev ( 15  gev ) .",
    "this is considerably smaller than the scale uncertainty and appears insignificant compared to the excess of the cdf data @xcite over the traditional nlo analysis in the ffns @xcite .",
    "the gmvfns scheme can be further improved by implementing the proper kinematic constraints on the threshold behaviour . in the case of the structure function @xmath87 ,",
    "this was done in ref .",
    "@xcite by appropriately introducing the variable @xmath88 ( acot(@xmath89 ) prescription ) .",
    "this was shown to enforce the proper threshold behaviour , to simplify the implementation , and to yield robust predictions .",
    "in a number of talks the current understanding of heavy quark fragmentation ( or hadronization ) was reviewed .",
    "this enters into every comparison of production cross sections with theory , to be discussed in the subsequent section .",
    "above all , fragmentation is very well constrained by experiment .",
    "the most precise data are nowadays those on b meson production in @xmath6 annihilation at the z resonance  @xcite . the compilation of lep and sld measurements in fig .",
    "[ fig : bfrag ] shows impressive agreement between the different analyses , which are based on exclusive ( @xmath90 lepton ) , semileptonic or inclusive vertex methods to tag the @xmath56 hadron and infer its momentum from the partially reconstructed final state .",
    "( 10,7)(0,0 )    the figure displays the unfolded spectrum of the momentum fraction of the weakly decaying hadron , normalized to the beam energy .",
    "it reflects both the effects of the hard qcd radiation processes and of the soft transition from the quark to the bound hadronic state .",
    "the experiments have also studied how well the data can be described when different parameterizations are used to model the soft phase , and arrive at the same ranking  @xcite , namely that the lund and the bowler shapes are preferred with respect to , e.g. the peterson parameterization .",
    "of course this conclusion is relevant only when a leading order ( lo ) parton shower approach as it is implemented in the jetset monte carlo program , is used to model the perturbative phase .    at hera",
    ", the charm fragmentation function has been probed  @xcite .",
    "since the initial state does not constrain the primordial quark momentum , the beam energy has been replaced by the jet energy to normalize the charm hadron s momentum fraction @xmath72 .",
    "hard gluon radiation thus affects the observable @xmath72 spectrum less than in the @xmath6 case .",
    "the measured distributions obtained by zeus , argus and opal , which are of course not expected to agree in detail , exhibit nevertheless the same gross features , and fitting a parton shower monte carlo prediction to the zeus data yields a peterson parameter consistent with @xmath6 findings .",
    "an enhancement at low @xmath72 , attributed to gluon splitting , is observed only in the opal data , in the argus and zeus case the energies are too low .",
    "gluon splitting to @xmath36 and @xmath91 pairs has been explicitly constrained by studying special ( 3 and 4 jet ) event topologies at lep  @xcite . for charm ,",
    "a new and quite precise aleph measurement and a new world average of @xmath92 has been presented at this conference  @xcite .",
    "this is somewhat above theoretical expectation , but consistent within errors .",
    "the situation is similar for the ten times smaller @xmath93 value  @xcite ; altogether this shows that also higher order corrections are well under control .",
    "another way to test the universality of the non - perturbative quark - hadron transition is to compare the fragmentation fractions  @xcite , i.e.  the relative rates with which the different weakly decaying heavy hadron states are being produced .",
    "zeus measured now , in addition to @xmath90 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 , also the production of @xmath96 and @xmath97 ( to represent the charmed baryons ) and have thus determined the complete set , so that the rates can now be normalized to the sum and no recurrence to mc for the total charm cross section has to be made anymore .",
    "table  [ tab : fragfrac ] compares the zeus results with h1 measurements , showing consistency of the hera data among each other , and with @xmath6 results , which confirms the universality of characteristics like the occurrence of strange mesons , baryons or vector mesons .",
    "( 10,5)(0,0 )    these results further validate the practice to use the clean and precise measurements from @xmath6 annihilation to model and interpret @xmath3 data .",
    "they give experimental support to a rigorous scheme to relate the qcd theory of quarks to observable single hadrons , which was sketched above and which provides a powerful means to probe parton dynamics .",
    "from an industrious community at hera and other machines , cross section data on open heavy flavour production keep coming in and providing new challenges to the common qcd framework .",
    "the two - photon analyses at lep2 are being finalized .",
    "@xmath91 production , after the l3 and opal observations , is now also seen by delphi  @xcite to be in excess of the massive nlo qcd prediction by more than a factor of 2 .",
    "direct and resolved photon processes contribute here with similar strength .",
    "the result appears to be in contrast to the two - photon data on charm production which are reproduced by theory , within errors .",
    "an inspection of the @xmath27 spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ggdst ] ) reveals that data lie rather at the upper side of the error range of the theoretical prediction , in particular for small transverse momenta .",
    "( 10,8)(0,0 )    one should bear in mind that the @xmath91 data are dominated by final states with @xmath99 , populating a region where the factorization ansatz may be at the limit of its validity .",
    "thanks to their upgraded trigger capabilities , cdf was able to present the first open charm cross section data from the tevatron to this conference  @xcite .",
    "the results , presently extracted from a rather small amount of luminosity , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cdfd ] in comparison with resummed qcd calculations in the fonll scheme ..

    "a number of new results from their ongoing heavy quark production analyses were reported by chorus  @xcite .",
    "for example , their data on charm meson production in charged current neutrino nucleon scattering improve the experimental constraints on the strange content of the nucleon .",

    "agreement is observed within expectation .",
    "the power of jet measurements is impressively demonstrated by the zeus analysis of charm dijet angular distributions in photoproduction , which has recently been finalized  @xcite .",
    "the cross sections ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gpjets ] ) are measured as a function of @xmath100 which can be reconstructed from the two jet rapidities and corresponds to the polar angle of the outgoing parton in the partonic rest frame in a @xmath101 process .",

    "the data show that for low @xmath102 the latter is found predominantly in the photon direction ( negative @xmath103 ) .",
    "this would not be expected in gluon gluon fusion ( and is not seen in the direct , high @xmath102 case dominated by photon gluon fusion ) , but matches well the predictions based on diagrams with a @xmath55 quark originating from the hadronic photon structure in the initial state .",
    "such processes are included in the fixed order massive qcd calculation , but only as ho correction to direct photoproduction . in the massless picture , this is a leading order process , and large nlo corrections are indeed found in the single inclusive case .",
    "one should also note the rather large uncertainty of the prediction in the massive scheme in this region .",
    "this example shows how constraints in hera kinematics and the quark hadron correlation in heavy meson production can be used to identify corners of phase space where improvements in the calculations are needed .",
    "@xmath56 production at hera is omitted in this write - up .",

    "they show consistency between old and new data , and between experiments in the observable range ; altogether they tend to be above expectations based on nlo qcd in the massive scheme .    in hadroproduction",
    ", hera b has appeared on the scene with a @xmath56 cross section measurement  @xcite , which is in agreement with qcd predictions .",
    "30 times more statistics has been collected , so one awaits the measurement of differential cross sections .    tagged @xmath56 jet cross sections are in principle less affected by theoretical uncertainties arising from collinear radiation than b meson or @xmath56 quark cross sections .",

    "[ fig : d0jets ] .",
    "( 10,5)(0,0 )    the increased energy of the upgraded tevatron implies an extra bonus of 30% in the expected top production rate  and the possibility to test its energy dependence .",

    "as for heavy - quarkonium production , the nrqcd factorization approach @xcite represents a rigorous theoretical framework that is renormalizable , devoid of infrared singularities , and predictive .",
    "it generalizes the csm curing its defects .",
    "however , nrqcd predictions for charmonium suffer from sizeable normalization uncertainties at lo , and it is an important task for the future to evaluate nlo corrections , both in @xmath8 and @xmath104 . at lo , there is room for nonperturbative ingredients , such as @xmath28 factorization , hard - comover enhancement , and shape functions , which tend to reduce the relative importance of the co processes and ameliorate the well - known shortages of nrqcd to describe the large-@xmath26 behaviour of inelastic photoproduction at hera and the charmonium polarization in hadroproduction at large @xmath27 at the tevatron . the necessity for such nonperturbative effects is expected to be reduced as nlo corrections",

    "then , the factorization theorem is at work , guaranteeing the universality and dglap evolution of the ( nonperturbative ) ffs , and a global data analysis is feasible .    from the experimental side ,",
    "one notes that many new results continue to increase the variety of channels with which the qcd framework of heavy flavour production is confronted .",
    "the tevatron definitely presented itself as an upcoming charm , beauty and top factory .",
    "the gross picture for open heavy flavours is that theory undershoots , in particular at low @xmath27 , and that error bands in the predictions should be taken seriously , as they are in general being exhausted once data appear .",
    "hera analyses continue to explore new domains of precision and phase space ; they hold the potential to provide further guidance to refine strategies in perturbative qcd , in particular with the enhanced potential of the upgraded collider and detector coming to production mode this year  @xcite .",
    "we thank all participants for their contributions to a very lively and interesting session , and the organizers for the invitation to a location so rich of exceptional charm and beauty .",
