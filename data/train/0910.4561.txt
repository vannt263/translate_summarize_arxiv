    "the classical moment problem ( cmp ) is an archetypal example of an inverse problem that involves reconstruction of a non - negative density distribution from a knowledge of ( usually finite ) moments  @xcite .",
    "the cmp is an important inverse problem that has attracted researchers from many diverse fields of science and engineering ranging from geological prospecting , computer tomography , medical imaging to transport in complex inhomogeneous media  @xcite .",
    "much of the early developments in the fields such as continued fractions and orthogonal polynomials have been inspired by this problem  @xcite .",
    "the extent to which an unknown density function can be determined depends on the amount of information available in the form of moments provided that the underlying moment problem is solvable . for a finite number of moments , it is not possible to obtain the unique solution and one needs to supplement additional information to construct a suitable solution .",
    "the maximum entropy provides a suitable framework to reconstruct a _ least biased _",
    "solution by simultaneously maximizing the entropy and satisfying the constraints defined by the moments  @xcite .    in this communication",
    "we address how the maximum entropy ( me ) principle can be applied to the hausdorff moment problem  @xcite in order to estimate the lyapunov exponent and the associated natural invariant density of a nonlinear dynamical system .",
    "in particular , we wish to apply our me ansatz to a number of nonlinear iterative maps in one - dimension for which the analytical results in the closed form are available .",
    "the problem was studied by steeb  @xcite via entropy optimization for the tent and the logistic maps using the first few moments ( up to 3 ) .",
    "recently , ding and mead  @xcite addressed the problem and applied their maximum entropy algorithm based on power moments to compute the lyapunov exponents for a number of chaotic maps .",
    "the authors generated lyapunov exponents using up to the first 12 moments , and obtained an accuracy of the order of 1% .",
    "in this paper , we address the problem using a method based on an iterative construction of maximum entropy solution of the moment problem , and apply it to compute lyapunov exponents and the natural invariant densities for a number of one - dimensional chaotic maps . unlike the power moment problem that becomes ill - conditioned with the increasing number of moments , the hallmark of our method is to construct a stable algorithm by resort to moments of chebyshev polynomials .",
    "the resulting algorithm is found to be very stable and accurate , and is capable of generating lyapunov exponents with an error less than 1 part in @xmath0 , which is significantly lower than any of the methods reported earlier  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the method can reproduce the natural invariant density of the chaotic maps that shows point - wise convergence to the exact density function whenever available .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly introduce the hausdorff moment problem and a discrete maximum entropy ansatz to construct the _ least biased _ solution that satisfies the moment constraints .",
    "this is followed by section 3 , where we introduce the natural invariant density as an eigenfunction of the perron - frobenius operator associated with the dynamical system represented by the iterative maps  @xcite . in section 4",
    ", we discuss how the moments of the invariant density are computed numerically via time evolution of the dynamical variable , which are then used to construct the lyapunov exponents and the natural invariant densities of the maps . finally ,",

    "the errors associated with @xmath48 are also listed in the respective tables .",
    "the invariant density for @xmath46 is a @xmath49-function , and the exact analytical value of the exponent is given by @xmath50 .",
    "since the invariant density is a @xmath49-function at @xmath51 , it is practically impossible to reproduce the density very accurately using a finite number of quadrature points .",
    "however , our maximum entropy algorithm produces an impressive result by generating only two non - zero values in the interval containing the point @xmath51 using gaussian quadrature with 192 points . the approximate density for a set of 40 moments is shown in fig .",
    "the two non - zero values of the density are given by 19.781 and 105.264 within the interval [ 0.593 , 0.601 ] .",
    "it may be noted that for a normalized density , one can estimate the maximum height of the @xmath49-function to be of the order of @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the interval containing the point @xmath54 point  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have found that the result is almost independent of the number of moments ( beyond the first 20 ) , and the @xmath49-function has been observed to be correctly reproduced with few non - zero values using only as few as first 10 moments .",
    "table 3 clearly shows that the first 3 digits have been correctly reproduced using only the first 10 moments .",
    "on increasing the number of moments , there is but very little improvement of the accuracy of lyapunov exponent . for each of the moment sets ,",
    "the density is found to be zero throughout the interval except at few ( two for the set 40 and higher ) points mentioned above . in absence of any structure in the density",
    ", higher moments do not contribute much to the density reconstruction , and hence it s more or less independent of the number of moments . since the contribution to the lyapunov exponent is coming only from the few ( mostly two ) non - zero values , and that these values fluctuate with varying moments , an oscillation of these values causes a mild oscillation in the lyapunov exponent .",
    "we now consider the case @xmath47 . the exact density in this case is given by eq .",
    "( [ bucket1 ] ) that has singularities at the end points @xmath28 = 0 and 1 .",
    "it is therefore instructive to study the divergence behavior of the reconstructed density near the end points . in fig.[fig4 ] we have plotted the approximate density obtained using the first 90 moments along with the exact density .",
    "the reconstructed density matches excellently within the interval .",
    "the divergence behavior near @xmath55 is also plotted in the inset .",
    "although there is some deviation from the exact density , the approximate density matches very good except at very small values of @xmath28 .",
    "such observation is also found to be true near @xmath56 .",
    "the results for the lyapunov exponent are listed in table [ tab3 ] for different number of moments .",
    "it is remarkable that the exponent has been correctly produced up to 3 decimal points with 100 moments .",
    "while the error in this case is larger compared to the cases discussed before for the same number of moments , it is much smaller than the result reported earlier  @xcite .",
    "our numerical investigation suggests that the integral converges slowly for gaussian quadrature in this case owing to the presence of a logarithmic singularity in the integrand .",
    "this requires one to use more gaussian points to evaluate the integral correctly .",
    "however , since the density itself has singularities at the end points , attempts to construct the density very close to the end points introduce error in the reconstructed density that affects the integral value . the use of gauss - chebyshev quadrature would ameliorate the latter problem , but for the purpose of generality ( and in absence of prior knowledge of the density ) we refrain ourselves from using the gauss - chebyshev quadrature .",
    "finally , we consider a case where analytical results are not available and the density consists of several sharp peaks having fine structure in the interval [ 0,1 ] .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the case @xmath57 for the logistic map provides such an example . the ` exact ' numerical density for this case is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] along with the reconstructed density for 20 moments .",
    "the former is obtained by iterating several starting @xmath33 and constructing an histogram of the distribution of the iterates in the long time limit , which is then finally averaged over many configurations . while our mep ansatz produces most of the peaks in the exact density using the first 20 moments , the fine structure of the peaks is missing and so is the location of the peaks . the reconstructed density can be improved systematically by increasing the number of moments , and for 150 moments the density matches very good with the exact density . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we have plotted both the reconstructed density for the first 150 moments and the numerical density from the histogram method .",
    "the result suggests that for sufficient number of moments our algorithm is capable of reproducing density which is highly irregular , non - differentiable and consists of several sharp peaks .",
    "we apply an iterative maximum entropy optimization technique based on chebyshev moments to calculate the invariant density and the lyapunov exponent for a number of one - dimensional nonlinear maps .",
    "the method consists of evaluating approximate moments of the invariant density from the time evolution of the dynamical variable of the iterative map , and to apply a novel function reconstruction technique via maximum entropy optimization subject to moment constraints .",
    "the computed lyapunov exponents from the approximated natural invariant density are found to be in excellent agreement with the exact analytical values .",
    "we demonstrate that the accuracy of the lyapunov exponent can be systematically improved by increasing the number of moments used in the ( density ) reconstruction process .",
    "an important aspect of our method is that it is very stable and accurate , and that it does not require the use of extended precision arithmetic for solving the moment problem .",
    "a comparison to the results obtained from power moments suggest that the algorithm based on chebyshev polynomials gives more accurate results than the power moments .",
    "this can be explained by taking into account the superior minimax property of the chebyshev polynomials and the form of the maximum entropy solution for chebyshev moments  @xcite .",
    "our method is particularly suitable for maps for which exact analytical expression for invariant density are not available . since the method can deal with a large number of moments , an accurate invariant density function can be constructed by studying the convergence behavior with respect to the number of moments .",
    "the lyapunov exponent can be obtained from a knowledge of the invariant density of the maps .",
    "finally , the method can also be adapted to solve non - linear differential and integral equations as discussed in refs.@xcite and @xcite , which we will address in a future communication .",

    "he also thanks professor arun k. bhattacharya of the university of burdwan ( india ) for several comments and discussions during the course of the work .",
    "the solution is unique in the sense that it is _ least biased _ as far as entropy of the density is concerned , and the hausdorff conditions are satisfied .",
    "there is no guarantee that the maximum entropy solution would be close to the exact solution particularly for very few moments .",

    "the presence of @xmath61 in the maximum entropy solution for power moments makes it very difficult to exploit information from the high order moments for @xmath62 in the interval [ 0 , 1 ] even with extended precision arithmetic .",
