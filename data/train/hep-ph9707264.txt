    "for @xmath210 , the integrands become more or less flat in @xmath22 and the @xmath6 behavior is linear in the whole range .    because the photon size parameter , @xmath211 , is the important scale in @xmath212 , the behavior changes in the neighborhood of @xmath213 .",
    "the region where the threshold suppression in photon - proton collisions is sizeable is therefore given by @xmath214 i.e. , @xmath215 for @xmath216 and @xmath217  gev , this shows that the effect becomes sizeable when @xmath218  gev@xmath0 , for an effective quark mass @xmath219  gev .",

    "we have computed the total photon proton cross section in a model of nonperturbative qcd . for values of the virtual photon mass @xmath228",
    "gev@xmath0 our input is the treatment of two wilson loops in minkowski space - time within a special model of nonperturbative qcd which approximates the infrared behavior by a gaussian stochastic process determined by a non - local gauge invariant gluon field correlator .",
    "the latter one is essentially given by the local gluon condensate and the correlation length . in order to fix the size distribution of one loop a proton valence quark wave function has to be introduced . in principle",
    "all parameters of the model can be determined by sources other than high energy scattering , namely lattice gauge calculations and low energy phenomenology . in practice",
    "the errors in the parameters still necessitate some adjustment to high energy scattering data .",
    "in our case we have chosen the determination of ref .",
    "@xcite based on the proton - proton total cross section and the logarithmic slope of the elastic @xmath229 cross section at zero momentum transfer .",
    "although the parameters turn out to be rather stable there remains still a certain variation in a range of a few percent for the correlation length and 2030% for the gluon condensate and the proton radius .",
    "the model gives energy independent cross sections , contrary to the slight @xmath230 energy dependence seen in low @xmath2 experiments .",
    "since the parameters are related to the isr energies , @xmath231  gev , we also compare the photon cross sections calculated here with experimental values around that energy .",
    "we have already used this procedure in order to calculate diffractive electroproduction of vector mesons with very good results .    in the present work we have extented the @xmath2 range down to @xmath79 . in order to do that we have constructed nonperturbative photon wave functions essentially by introducing a virtuality dependent constituent quark mass .",
    "we were encouraged to such a simple procedure by model investigations of harmonic oscillator green functions . in our method",
    "we adjusted the value of the momentum dependent quark mass to reproduce the phenomenological two point function of the vector currents .",
    "the development of a quark mass at large distances has been seen also in calculations with the instanton liquid model  @xcite .",
    "we repeat that none of our input parameters was in any way related or adjusted to electroproduction phenomenology .",
    "our approach differs in several ways from other investigations . for the treatment of the soft exchanges , nikolaev and zakharov",
    "have adopted a phenomenological two - gluon - exchange model  @xcite .",
    "their treatment also gives importance to the @xmath20 photon wave function and their dipole - proton cross section has a @xmath125 behavior at short distance and saturates in the @xmath2322  fm region . to suppress the contribution from large distance in the photon wave function they cut off the large size component using a smooth gaussian @xmath233 with a confinement size parameter @xmath234fm . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a current quark mass @xmath235  mev was used , but in a later study of the same authors on the bfkl pomeron  @xcite a constant light quark mass @xmath236  mev was considered . as we have seen in our study such a value can help to limit the extent of the photon wave function , but at large @xmath2 there is no reason that the light quarks have masses different from the current quark masses",
    ". in the region of transverse distance probed , we have seen that the nonperturbative features of the gluon correlators are important and we think that a perturbative two - gluon exchange model can not be trusted .    concerning the transition to small @xmath2",
    ", we have shown an approach different from vector meson dominance ( vmd ) frequently used in the low @xmath2 range .",
    "we claim that with increasing @xmath2 one would have to put a rapidly growing number of resonances into the vmd model which thereby becomes untractable .",
    "our scheme of quark - hadron duality exploits the knowledge about the residue and the mass of the lowest vector meson state contributing to the vector current two - point function .",
    "based on the transition between a vmd description of @xmath147 at small @xmath2 and the partonic one at large @xmath2 badelek and kwieciski have proposed to represent the proton structure function via dispersion relation  @xcite .",
    "the construction adopted here shares similarities with their approach although the latter makes no connexion to the notion of wave function which we need for the microscopic description of diffractive scatterings . in their approach",
    "the partonic contribution to @xmath147 is extracted from structure function analysis at large @xmath2 and thus naturally fulfills perturbative qcd evolution at large virtualities where this evolution is experimentally observed .",
    "such perturbative corrections are not implemented in our approach .",
    "our results are encouraging . without any adjustment",
    "they agree with experiments over the full @xmath2 range from 0 to 20  gev@xmath0 within 1020% .",
    "for the high @xmath2 range we have shown how finite energy corrections may account for at least a part of the discrepancy without changing any of the model parameter and without affecting the good description of the transition region where the modification of the perturbative @xmath20 wave function is at work .",
    "it is rather difficult to decide with present data what is the best scheme in our approach , i.e. , whether or not the effective mass depends on the quark light cone fraction . in order to put our result in a larger perspective ,",
    "we show in fig .",

    "( [ effective - mass ] ) and  ( [ effective - s - mass ] ) , if we adjust the normalization by @xmath23710% ( which would amount , e.g. , to a 5% reduction of the gluon condensate ) .",
    "a rescaling of the curve in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] by @xmath23715% shows the same pattern .",
    "we describe almost perfectly the @xmath2 dependence of the data in the whole @xmath2 range examined .",
    "this points toward the possibility that the chiral transition is already seen in present data , the kink in the data at @xmath34  gev@xmath0 being related to the vanishing of the quark mass at that value of @xmath2 ( chiral restoration ) .",
    "the photon - proton cross section could also be easily adjusted by a slight decrease of the constituent quark mass .    because of the fundamental importance of chiral symmetry breaking for hadron physics , the question of chiral symmetry restoration with increasing virtuality @xmath2 of the photon deserves to be studied in more detail .",
    "more systematic data for @xmath238 and @xmath239 at fixed @xmath187 and varying @xmath2 would help in deciding whether a marked change occurs between the low momentum domain and the perturbative domain in inelastic electron scattering .",
