    "recent months have seen a substantial amount of new experimental results on _ unpolarized _ deep - inelastic electron - photon scattering from lep @xcite which provide a considerably extended kinematical coverage in @xmath4 and @xmath5 as compared to all previous results since pep and petra .",
    "complementary information on the partonic structure of photons is provided by photoproduction measurements at hera , in particular from ( di-)jet production data @xcite , and combining these results should not only vastly improve our knowledge of the photon structure but also seriously challenges the presently available theoretical models .    a similar analysis in _ longitudinally polarized _",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath6 collisions would be desirable .",
    "measuring the difference between the independent helicity combinations of the incoming particles , @xmath7\\;\\;,\\ ] ] instead of the sum , as in unpolarized ( helicity - averaged ) experiments , would give access to the parton structure of circularly polarized photons , which is completely unknown experimentally so far .",
    "these distributions are defined by @xmath8 where @xmath9 @xmath10 denotes the density of a parton @xmath11 with helicity ` + ' ( ` @xmath12 ' ) in a photon with helicity ` + ' .",
    "the densities @xmath13 contain information different from that contained in the unpolarized ones [ defined by taking the sum in ( [ eq : pdfdef ] ) ] , and their measurement is necessary for a thorough understanding of the partonic structure of photons .",
    "the complete next - to - leading order ( nlo ) qcd framework for the @xmath5-evolution of @xmath13 and the calculation of the polarized photon structure function @xmath14 was recently provided in @xcite and will be briefly reviewed here ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath13 obey the well - known _ inhomogeneous _ evolution equations schematically given by @xmath15 ( any obvious @xmath4 and @xmath5 dependence is suppressed here and in what follows ) , where @xmath16 stands for the flavor non - singlet ( ns ) quark combinations or the singlet ( s ) vector @xmath17 . the symbol @xmath18 denotes the usual convolution in bjorken-@xmath4 space .",
    "the evolution equations ( [ eq : gl1 ] ) are most conveniently solved in mellin-@xmath19 moment space , where the solutions can be given analytically .",
    "the 1-loop ( lo ) and 2-loop ( nlo ) contributions to polarized photon - to - parton and parton - to - parton splitting functions , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , in ( [ eq : gl1 ] ) can be found in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the solution of ( [ eq : gl1 ] ) can be decomposed into a ` pointlike ' ( inhomogeneous ) and a ` hadronic ' ( homogeneous ) part , @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ns , s ) and can be found in @xcite ( with obvious replacements of all unpolarized quantities by their polarized counterparts ) .",
    "spin - dependent deep - inelastic electron - photon scattering ( dis ) can be parametrized in terms of a _ new _ , polarized structure function @xmath24 , in analogy to @xmath25 and @xmath26 in the helicity - averaged case , and the nlo expression for @xmath14 reads @xcite @xmath27 \\bigg\\ }    + \\frac{3\\alpha}{4\\pi } \\sum_{f = u , d , s } \\!e_f^4 \\delta c_{\\gamma}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the coefficient functions @xmath28 and @xmath29 can be found in the @xmath30 scheme , e.g. , in @xcite , and @xmath31 being the number of active flavors .",
    "the @xmath32 dependence of the photonic coefficient @xmath33 @xcite causes perturbative instability problems for @xmath34 in the @xmath30 scheme .",
    "but , as in the unpolarized case @xcite , one can overcome this ` problem ' by absorbing @xmath33 into the definition of the quark densities @xcite ( @xmath35 scheme ) .",
    "only the contribution of the light flavors has been written out in ( [ eq : g1 ] ) .",
    "heavy quark contributions to @xmath14 should be more appropriately included via the relevant fully massive polarized boson fusion subprocesses ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    at present",
    "one has to fully rely on theoretical models for the @xmath13 .",
    "the only guidance is provided by the positivity of the helicity dependent cross sections on the r.h.s .  of ( [ eq : xsecdef ] ) demanding that @xmath36 .",
    "this can be directly translated into a useful constraint on the densities ) still serves as a reasonable ` starting point ' for the nlo densities .",
    "] in terms of the already known unpolarized distributions",
    "@xmath37 : @xmath38 of @xmath14 vanishes irrespective of @xmath5 [ ` current conservation ' ( cc ) ] .",
    "this result holds to all orders in perturbation theory and at every twist provided that the fermions in the theory have non - vanishing mass @xcite . due to the properties of the splitting and coefficient functions for @xmath39 , cc",
    "is automatically fulfilled for the pointlike part of @xmath14 and hence can be enforced for the full @xmath14 by demanding a vanishing hadronic quark input for @xmath39 ( the gluon is not constrained in the @xmath40 or @xmath41 scheme since @xmath42 for @xmath39 ) .    to obtain a realistic estimate for the theoretical uncertainties in @xmath13 coming from the unknown hadronic input , we consider two very different scenarios in lo .",
    "both scenarios can be straightforwardly extended to nlo , see @xcite for details . ]",
    "@xcite based on the positivity bound ( [ eq : pos ] ) : for the first ( ` _ maximal scenario _ ' ) we saturate ( [ eq : pos ] ) using the phenomenologically successful unpolarized grv photon densities @xcite @xmath43 whereas the other extreme input ( ` _ minimal scenario _ ' ) is defined by @xmath44 with @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "of the two extreme hadronic inputs only ( [ eq : minsat ] ) satisfies cc .",
    "however , if one is interested only in the region of , say , @xmath46 , cc could well be implemented by contributions from smaller @xmath4 , which do not affect the evolutions at larger @xmath4 . rather than artificially enforcing the vanishing of the first moment of the @xmath47 in ( [ eq : maxsat ] )",
    ", we therefore stick to the two extreme scenarios as introduced above .",
    "figure 1 compares our lo @xmath48-quark and gluon distributions and the structure function @xmath14 for the two extreme scenarios based on ( [ eq : maxsat ] ) and ( [ eq : minsat ] ) at @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the pointlike evolution leads to a sizeable negative @xmath48-quark distribution for @xmath4 around @xmath51 in the ` minimal ' scenario despite of the vanishing input ( [ eq : minsat ] ) . in the shown , experimentally relevant @xmath5 region",
    "the quark densities in the ` maximal ' scenario mainly have a different sign and are smaller in their absolute size .",
    "hence one should expect spin asymmetries with opposite signs for quark dominated processes like dis ( cf .  the results for @xmath14 in fig .  1 and fig .  3 ) .",
    "on the contrary the gluon distribution remains small in the ` minimal ' scenario for all values of @xmath5 , and one thus expects almost vanishing polarized cross sections and spin asymmetries for gluon dominated processes such as jet production ( cf .",
    "fig .  4 below ) .",
    "to finish this section let us briefly turn to the two conceivable future experiments : running hera in a polarized collider mode at some stage in the future @xcite or using a linear @xmath2 collider with polarized beams .",
    "measurements of spin asymmetries in , e.g. , the photoproduction of large-@xmath52 ( di-)jets can then in principle reveal information on the @xmath13 through the presence of ` resolved ' photon processes in the first case .",
    "this has been extensively studied in recent years and was shown to be feasible @xcite . here",
    "we focus exclusively on the latter option which has not attracted much interest so far .",
    "a future polarized linear @xmath2 collider can provide complementary information on the @xmath13 by measuring the structure function @xmath24 or spin asymmetries in resolved two - photon reactions @xcite .",
    "before turning to a study of possible tests and signatures for @xmath13 it is worthwhile and important to explore and compare the different sources for polarized photons at a linear collider first .",
    "this is because all experimentally accessible spin asymmetries directly because normalization uncertainties , etc .",
    ", conveniently drop out in the cross section ratio . ]",
    "can be _ roughly _ decomposed as @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the ( polarized ) unpolarized cross section under consideration , @xmath55 is the yield of polarized photons , @xmath56 is related to certain combinations of @xmath57 , and @xmath58 is the partonic subprocess cross section asymmetry .",
    "the latter quantity is calculable in perturbative qcd , while @xmath56 is sensitive to the unknown distributions @xmath13 we are looking for .",
    "obviously , the photon flux spin asymmetry in ( [ eq : decomp ] ) should be as large as possible to make an extraction of @xmath13 feasible , ideally @xmath59 largely independent of different kinematical configurations .",
    "the ` standard ' description for polarized photons is the equivalent photon approximation ( epa ) where a circularly polarized photon is collinearly radiated off a longitudinally polarized electron .",
    "the epa spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) for a typical set of parameters at a future linear collider , and the flux spin asymmetry is approximately given by the electron - to - photon splitting function ratio @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the energy fraction of the photon taken away from the electron .",
    "as can be seen from ( [ eq : ww ] ) and fig .",
    "2(a ) , the flux asymmetry becomes rapidly less and less favorable as @xmath62 .",
    "in addition the spectrum is broad , i.e. , not mono - energetic , which causes experimental problems in dis since the @xmath63 c.m.s .",
    "energy is not known and the momentum fraction @xmath4 can not be reconstructed as in @xmath6 scattering .",
    "photon beams can be obtained also via compton backscattering of laser photons off the linac electrons @xcite .",
    "these @xmath64 colliders , which are experimentally challenging and have not been realized yet , were so far mainly regarded as a novel tool to study , e.g. , properties of intermediate mass higgs bosons , but they are also particularly suited for qcd studies of the ( un)polarized photon structure . polarizing the electron beams and/or laser photons not only provides circularly polarized backscattered photons but also allows one to tailor the energy spectrum of the photon to one s needs . colliding like - handed electrons and laser photons results in a broad spectrum and colliding oppositely handed electrons and photons results in a peaked distribution for the backscattered photon as can be seen in figs .",
    "2(b ) and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "it is important to notice that in both cases the resulting photons are _ highly polarized _ ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath65 in ( [ eq : decomp ] ) .",
    "the helicity dependent cross sections for such a @xmath64 collider have to be labeled by four helicities , the helicities of both the two electron beams and the two laser photons , instead of two as on the r.h.s .  of ( [ eq : xsecdef ] ) .",
    "this allows , of course , more ways to define @xmath66 , however , in practice the use of either of the two spectra shown in fig .",
    "2 seems to be the most promising option .",
    "apart from the helicities the compton kinematics is controlled by a dimensionless variable @xmath4 which is correlated with the maximum energy of the backscattered photons . in fig .",
    "2 we have chosen the maximum value @xmath67 which just prevents reconversion of the high - energetic photon into an @xmath2 pair @xcite .",
    "equipped with the technical framework let us now study possible tests and signatures for the @xmath13 at a future linear @xmath2 collider with a c.m.s .",
    "energy of @xmath68 and choice of either having the epa or backscattered laser photons as the source for polarized photons .",
    "figure 3 shows predictions for the dis spin asymmetry @xmath1 in lo using the two extreme models for the @xmath13 based on the inputs ( [ eq : maxsat ] ) and ( [ eq : minsat ] ) . for the target photon , the photon flux of fig .",
    "2(b ) was used c.m.s .",
    "energy caused by the tail to low @xmath61 in the photon flux . the peaked spectrum in fig .",
    "2(c ) also has a tail which has to be cut - off somehow .",
    "specially tailored spectra should lead , however , to qualitatively very similar results as in fig .  3 .",
    "] . also shown is the expected statistical uncertainty for such a measurement assuming an integrated luminosity of @xmath69 and two bins in @xmath4 and @xmath5 per decade .",
    "given these error bars it should be feasible to distinguish between the two extreme scenarios at not too large values of @xmath4 . for @xmath34",
    "the two models become very similar anyway due to the dominance of the pointlike part .",
    "it is important to stress that a study of @xmath70 appears to be _ not _ feasible without having backscattered laser photons as target because the statistical errors would become too large .    since ( di)-jet production was shown to be a very promising tool to decipher the @xmath13 at a future polarized hera @xmath6 collider @xcite , we extend these studies here to linear @xmath2 colliders",
    ". di - jet production is particularly suited as it allows to define single ( double ) resolved photon samples on an experimental basis by demanding that the momentum fractions for one ( both ) photon(s ) are less than some cut , say , @xmath71 .",
    "the direct photon ` background ' , @xmath72 , which is concentrated at @xmath73 is discarded in that way . in the unpolarized case",
    "such measurements were performed at lep2 by opal @xcite recently .",
    "4 shows our expectations for the double resolved di - jet spin asymmetry @xmath74 in lo using similar cuts in transverse momentum @xmath52 and rapidity @xmath75 of the jets as in @xcite .",
    "@xmath74 is dominated by gluon - gluon initiated subprocesses , and hence an almost vanishing asymmetry is obtained for the minimal scenario as expected from fig .  1 .",
    "again , backscattered compton photons are strongly favored compared to the equivalent photon spectrum , but a measurement might be possible also in the latter case here .",
    "it turns out that uncertainties due to the choice of the factorization scale , which are expected to be particularly pronounced in lo , cancel to a large extent in the ratio @xmath74 . for jet production in polarized @xmath6 collisions",
    "it was shown that lo qcd agrees reasonably well with monte carlo ( mc ) results including parton showering and hadronization @xcite , however , due to the lack of a mc generator for polarized @xmath64 collisions such a study is not possible here for the time being .    to actually unfold information on @xmath13",
    "it is useful to introduce the concept of ` effective parton densities ' @xcite . although @xmath74 is dominated by @xmath76 scattering , all qcd subprocesses contribute , which considerably complicates any analysis . in the unpolarized case",
    "it was shown @xcite that the ratios of dominant subprocesses , those with a @xmath77-channel gluon exchange , are roughly constant , i.e. , @xmath78 . hence by introducing a suitable effective parton density @xmath79 the jet cross section factorizes into these densities times a _ single _ subprocess cross section . in the polarized case",
    "this factorization is slightly broken as @xmath80 .",
    "however , the approximation still works surprisingly well at a level of @xmath81 accuracy , and the appropriate effective densities are given by @xcite @xmath82 such that the polarized double resolved jet cross section can be expressed as @xmath83 having extracted @xmath84 from a measurement of @xmath74 exploiting ( [ eq : effxsec ] ) and @xmath85 from elsewhere , e.g. , from dis , one can determine @xmath86 using ( [ eq : effpdf ] ) .",
    "it was shown that a future linear @xmath2 collider could reveal _ first _ information on the presently completely unmeasured parton densities of circularly polarized photons .",
    "studies of the spin asymmetry in dis and double resolved di - jet production appear to be particularly suited .",
    "it was demonstrated that it would be highly favorable , even mandatory in case of dis , to have backscattered laser photons available for these measurements .",
    "compared to a measurement of the @xmath13 in resolved photoproduction processes at a polarized hera , a linear collider would provide a much ` cleaner ' environment since the spin - dependent proton densities do not enter here and thus do not interfere with the extraction of @xmath13 .",
