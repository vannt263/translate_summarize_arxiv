    "the most common form of dna found under normal physiological low salt conditions is the b - dna , the well known double helix with a right handed helicity .",
    "quite surprisingly , the first dna structure to be solved by x - ray crystallography turned out to be a left handed zig - zag form called the z - dna@xcite .",
    "this z - dna can be stabilized in vitro in presence of high salt concentration , cations or negative super - coiling .",
    "although the z form is transient in vivo due to the lack of friendly environment , still the b - z conversion is relevant in poxviruses@xcite , and alzeimer s disease@xcite .",
    "apart from the inversion of helicity , the z - dna has a repeat unit of 2 base pairs compared to one for b. thus a conformational transformation from the b to the z form takes place as , e.g. , the ionic concentration or super - coiling is changed .",
    "the b - z transition is first order in nature@xcite .    as the base pairs and a subset of backbone",
    "sugar rings have to flip to execute the b - z transition involving changes in helical chirality , the dynamics offers intriguing possibilities@xcite .",
    "only recently methods have been developed to explore the dynamics in single dna as opposed to earlier studies in solutions , though with conflicting results . in ref .",
    "@xcite the b - z conformational transformation for a short 15 base pair gt ( non - watson - crick wobble base pair ) dna wrapped on a single walled carbon nanotube was monitored as a function of time by the addition of counter - ions .",
    "the nanotube helped in identifying the phases via accurate measurements of the band - gap in a simpler geometry .",
    "this transition is completely reversible and is thermodynamically identical to the transition seen in the absence of the nanotube .",
    "_ the results seem to indicate the formation of a denatured _ dna _ during the transformation _ ,",
    "eventhough a denatured state under the experimental conditions is not possible thermodynamically .",
    "a different single molecule experiment studied the transition under a tension and negative super - helicity by combining fret with magnetic tweezers@xcite .",
    "this experiment on an effectively ( gc)@xmath0 dna ( i.e. 22 bases ) _ seems to favour a single interface between _ b _ and _ z _ without any denatured bubble_.    one can characterize the b - z transformation by a growth of a suitable domain over the bulk of dna . in any such scenario , the b - z interface , the separator between the two chiral phases , plays an important role .",
    "the equilibrium interface has been characterized structurally and from other studies .",
    "the structure of a short oligomer in presence of a z - dna binding protein at 2.6a resolution indicates broken base pairs separating the b and the z phases .",
    "the protein acting as an external source inducing the transition is expected to produce a sharp interface@xcite .",
    "a very ingenious way of studying the interface is to use mirror dna@xcite , though it can not be used for chirality changing transition .",
    "interfacial studies and melting of short b - b * oligomers , where b * is the enantiomer of b , show that the junction mimics the b - z junction , and the interface broadens as the melting point is reached .",
    "in contrast to these equilibrium cases , the nature of the interface during the transition depends on the nature of the transition mechanism@xcite .",
    "several such schemes are in vogue and discussed in detail in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the two main competing hypothesis for the b to z transition mechanism are the following .",
    "it is either via ( 1 ) the base pair separation followed by base pair flipping@xcite , or ( 2 ) the base pair flipping without any base pair separation@xcite . in the first case",
    "there could be a denatured intermediate state while in the second there could a z type but following the standard watson - crick base pairing ( zwc - dna ) .",
    "the apparently contradictory results from the two single molecule experiments and the controversy associated with the b - z transition mechanism in general , motivate us to study a coarse - grained thermodynamic model for the dynamics .",
    "this implicitly requires infinitely long chains , since small length dnas or oligo - nucleotides do not show any proper thermodynamic phase transition . inducing the b to z",
    "transition is tantamount to a lowering of the free energy of z compared to b making z the most preferable state .",
    "we in our formulation use the simplification of the single molecule experiments to restrict the geometry to one - dimension only .",
    "the boundaries of the long chain are maintained in the two states so that the new structure develops from one side .",
    "in such a problem the dynamics of the transition produces a steady state with uniformly moving front ( or fronts ) .",
