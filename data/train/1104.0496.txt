    "successful runnings of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern are now opening a new era of high energy physics .",
    "it is highly anticipated that not only the last missing piece of the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , the higgs boson , would be discovered , but the new physics beyond the sm would appear for the first time .",
    "one of the most striking events that the lhc would reveal is the production of mini black holes .",
    "mini black holes can be produced when there are extra dimensions @xcite . in these scenarios",
    "the fundamental energy scale for strong gravitation @xmath3 in @xmath4-spacetime dimensions is much smaller than the planck mass . in the case of @xmath5 tev",
    ", the lhc experiments can probe the strong gravity regime and possibly produce black holes @xcite .",
    "once the black hole is produced it decays instantaneously through hawking radiation @xcite .",
    "typically the lifetime of a mini black hole is @xmath6 sec and the size of the schwarzschild radius is @xmath7 fm .",
    "if the black hole is produced at the lhc , we can detect its creation by observing hawking radiation . in these reasons",
    "there have been many works on the emission of particles by mini black holes both static and rotating in extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "rotating ( or kerr ) black holes exhibit a very interesting phenomenon known as superradiant scattering .",
    "when a wave of the form @xmath8 is incident on a rotating object of angular velocity @xmath9 , the wave is amplified if @xmath10 .",
    "if one surrounds the rotating object by a mirror which reflects the scattered wave , the wave bounces back and forth between the black hole and the mirror . during the process the wave amplifies itself and the extracted energy from the black hole grows exponentially",
    "this is so called the press - teukolsky black - hole bomb @xcite .",
    "even though there were no mirror , a mass term can play a role of the mirror to reflect the scattered field back to the black hole . in this case",
    "the massive field is in the bound state with the black hole , resulting in the instability of the black hole .",
    "there are many works on the black hole bomb where a massive particle is bound to a celestial black hole under superradiance @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", however , it was shown that higher dimensional kerr black holes do not exhibit such instabilities for massive fields because there are no bound geodesics in the spacetime around the black hole .    in this work",
    "we analyze the emission of a massive scalar field by a rotating mini black hole in higher dimensions . to focus on the possibility of forming a black hole bomb ,",
    "we simply impose the mirror condition as a boundary condition . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "the mass term is not enough for the role of mirror , and electromagnetic fields might do the work for charged particles , but we do not consider any technical details of the mirror .",
    "we simply assume that the mirror boundary condition is given by whatever reflects the scattered particle back to the black hole .",
    "the imaginary part of the field frequency @xmath11 which is responsible for the field amplification is then easily obtained by matching the solutions of the klein - gordon equation and by the boundary condition .",
    "it is possible that particles are emitted from the higher dimensional black hole not only on the brane but also in the bulk . in general",
    ", the relative ratio of bulk - to - brane energy emissivity is quite less than unity @xcite , as is expected intuitively .",
    "more specifically , the imaginary part of @xmath11 for the bulk emission is suppressed by a factor of @xmath12 compared with the brane emission where @xmath13 is a small quantity , so we do not consider the bulk emission in the present work .",
    "in this section , we describe the rotating black holes in higher @xmath14 dimensions just as in the way of @xcite .",
    "we assume that the angular momentum lies parallel to our brane , and the black hole emits particles only on the brane .",
    "a proper background geometry is @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 here @xmath17 is related to the black hole mass @xmath18 and the fundamental mass scale @xmath3 in @xmath19 dimensions via @xmath20 and @xmath21 is proportional to the black hole angular momentum @xmath22 as @xmath23 the black hole horizon is determined by the condition @xmath24 , and the horizon radius @xmath25 satisfies @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "now consider a massive scalar field of mass @xmath28 under the gravitational background ( [ metric ] ) .",
