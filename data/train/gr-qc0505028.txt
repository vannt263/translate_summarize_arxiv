    "compact binary systems of co - orbiting neutron stars or black holes are among the most promising sources of gravitational waves for a set of recently - constructed interferometric detectors , including the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( ligo ) .",
    "a substantial effort has been underway for some years now to model these systems theoretically , and thereby establish detailed predictions for comparison with experimental data .",
    "these predictions will likely be needed not only for verification of the theory , but for constructing filters needed to separate signal from noise in the detectors . because a compact binary system admits no obvious symmetry or approximation , the theoretical problem is being tackled primarily within the field of numerical relativity , which aims to integrate directly the full einstein field equations on the computer .",
    "a numerical solution of the einstein equations usually proceeds in three steps ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent review and references ) .",
    "the first step solves the constraint equations of general relativity to find initial data for the problem .",
    "the second then evolves these data forward in time using the remaining field equations . in the third step",
    "the numerical solution of the second step is interpreted physically .",
    "this paper  as the other papers in this series  is interested in the third , last step of numerical relativity .",
    "although conceptually straightforward , this program encounters many technical difficulties which make it seem unlikely that numerical relativity will be able to evolve compact binaries for many orbits ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite for recent progress ) . within the field , the consensus answer to these difficulties is to start the simulations using initial data which describe the system at small binary separations , shortly before coalescence .",
    "this approach introduces a fresh conceptual problem , however .",
    "it is far from clear how to pick initial data at small separation",
    "so as to replicate the outgoing wave pattern which would arise during a gradual inspiral from large separation . intuitively , generic data describing a close binary will contain spurious radiation originating in the particular mathematical technique used to solve the constraint equations rather than in the astrophysics of the problem .",
    "in fact , it is known that different methods of solving the constraint equations lead to physically distinct initial data ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this paper is the third in a series which outlines a scheme to analyze the radiation content of a given spacetime using invariant techniques based solely on the physical metric .",
    "more specifically , this paper uses an invariant _ radiation scalar _ to measure the amount of radiation , including spurious radiation , in a variety of initial data sets familiar to the numerical relativity community . in general",
    ", a radiation scalar is a scalar function on spacetime derived from the physical metric which , when spacetime unambiguously describes gravitational radiation propagating in some background , manifestly contains information only about the radiative degrees of freedom .",
    "there may be many such metric invariants which could be defined .",
    "we will focus on just one , denoted @xmath0 , which we call the bb radiation scalar @xcite .",
    "this particular scalar seems well - suited to problems , like binary black - hole inspiral , where the quiescent end - state describes weak radiation propagating outside a single black hole approaching equilibrium .",
    "ultimately , the idea would be to minimize in some sense this measure of radiation content and thereby identify more physically reasonable binary initial data sets . while this intuitive idea is easy to state",
    ", there are a number of caveats to taking the picture it suggests too seriously . nonetheless , the results of this paper suggest the radiation scalar approach could used effectively in this way .",
    "the definition of the bb scalar , and the scheme on which it is based , has certain strengths and limitations . in this context ,",
    "the key strength of this approach lies in its direct applicability to initial data sets .",
    "( in addition , the bb scalar may also have intriguing applications for evolution data . ) the only currently - known unambiguous way to minimize the spurious radiation content of such data is to use the evolution equations themselves . as evolution proceeds ,",
    "spurious radiation will naturally propagate outward , and eventually off the numerical domain for the problem",
    ". the gravitational radiation remaining in the instantaneous data at later times would then be the astrophysically sound radiation generated by the binary at earlier times .",
    "however , the dynamical evolution also introduces numerical error , and the difficulties associated with this dynamical evolution , especially for binary black hole systems , motivated the construction of small - separation initial data in the first place .",
    "in contrast , the bb scalar may be calculated directly from an initial data set ( see the first paper in this series @xcite , hereafter paper i ) . no evolution is required .",
    "the approach also offers a potentially useful tool for the extraction of gravitational radiation from numerically evolved spacetimes ( see @xcite , hereafter paper ii ) . however , here we focus exclusively on the application to initial data sets",
    ".    the main risk of the bb scalar approach lies in trying to push its physical interpretation beyond its appropriate scope .",
    "this point has been emphasized in previous papers @xcite in this series .",
    "while mainly conceptual in origin , this issue raises genuine practical problems in applications like those considered in this paper .",
    "the interpretation of the bb scalar is unambiguous when spacetime describes weak - wave perturbations of a single black hole , an approximation which becomes increasingly accurate at late times after coalescence of a binary system . in particular , it is certain to be small in this perturbative context .",
    "however , it remains calculable much more generally , although this precise physical interpretation is lost .",
    "this is hardly surprising since even the notion of gravitational radiation can not be defined unambiguously in general regions of spacetime .",
    "more pragmatically , there is nothing to guarantee that the radiation scalar can not be small in this broader context , where spacetime might intuitively be said to describe strong radiation fields .",
    "that is , although the radiation scalar is definitely small when little radiation is present , it may also be small coincidentally even when this is not the case .",
    "this can happen because , whereas ingoing and outgoing gravitational radiation in perturbation theory is intuitively associated with the two newman ",
    "penrose weyl curvature components @xmath1 and @xmath2 measured in a particular null - tetrad frame , the bb scalar measures just their product : @xmath3 .",
    "thus , in an extreme example , even though the outgoing component of the radiation field described by @xmath2 may be non - perturbatively large , if the ingoing component @xmath1 vanishes then so does @xmath0",
    ". however , this can not happen accidentally .",
    "intuitively , outgoing radiation will scatter off the fixed potential described by the background in which it propagates to produce an ingoing signal .",
    "the outgoing signal would have to be very carefully tuned to the background in order to have the the net effects of this back - scattering cancel exactly throughout some region of spacetime .",
    "the mathematical expression of this fact lies in the teukolsky ",
    "starobinsky identities , which interrelate the derivatives of the two seemingly independent components of the radiation field @xmath1 and @xmath2 in a kerr black - hole background . following this extreme example",
    ", one might reasonably expect situations wherein the bb scalar is coincidentally small are rare and non - generic .",
    "this paper tests that expectation using exact , analytical initial data sets whose gravitational wave content is already  independently  rather well understood .",
    "the results are encouraging .",
    "we find that , at least in these specific cases , the expectation that the radiation scalar should not be small coincidentally in typical situations of practical interest is indeed supported by the facts .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ recipe ] , we summarize the recipe developed in paper i for extracting the bb scalar from 3 + 1 cauchy data for the gravitational field .",
    "the following three sections explicitly calculate the bb scalar in three different continuous families of analytical initial data sets .",
    "section [ lin_wave ] focuses on linearized wave propagating on a flat background .",
    "this is a worthwhile test because the bb scalar was explicitly developed as a tool to analyze such linearized waves propagating around a kerr black hole .",
    "in fact , the presence of a dominant background component , associated with the `` coulombic '' kerr geometry , has been used explicitly to define the bb scalar .",
    "it is therefore noteworthy that the approach is also effective when such a dominant coulombic field is absent .",
    "section [ rbh ] turns to genuine black hole solutions , analyzing bowen  york initial data for single black holes using the bb scalar .",
    "this is probably the most physically significant application considered here .",
    "it finds that , whereas the bb scalar does vanish in the kerr spacetime where clearly no radiation is present , it does not vanish for the bowen ",
    "york data .",
    "we explicitly find a quartic growth of @xmath0 with the angular momentum @xmath4 of the bowen ",
    "york hole .",
    "this is exactly what one would naively have expected .",
    "section [ kasner ] calculates the bb scalar in the cosmological kasner solution .",
    "we do this to illustrate both the limitations and the ancillary benefits of our approach .",
    "the bb scalar does _ not _ vanish in these spacetimes , even though they are understood to contain no radiation",
    ". however , this is not surprising since these cosmological solutions do not contain a radiation zone in which the usual physical meaning could be attached to the bb scalar .",
    "nonetheless , we find that it _ can _ be used as an interesting gauge - invariant tool to partially characterize the gravitational field in this context .",
    "one must only resist the temptation to think of it as a _ radiation _ scalar .",
    "finally , section [ discsum ] summarizes our results and makes a few further comments regarding their interpretation .",
    "this section closely follows the method of paper i to construct the bb scalar @xmath0 from numerical relativity data .",
    "we refer to paper i @xcite for further details and discussion of this recipe .",
    "it is recapitulated here only for convenience .",
    "we begin our discussion at the level of spacetime geometry , where the weyl curvature tensor picks out exactly three null tetrads , up to certain scaling transformations , at a generic event .",
    "these are the `` transverse frames '' in which the newman  penrose curvature components @xmath5 and @xmath6 vanish . at sufficiently large distances from the sources , in a radiation zone , it is possible to single out one of these three , called the quasi - kinnersley frame , on which our definitions are based .",
    "the name derives from a particular null tetrad introduced by kinnersley on a particular spacetime , the stationary kerr black hole , and subsequently used by teukolsky to analyze the gravitational radiation content of perturbed black hole spacetimes .",
    "teukolsky found that , when one makes perturbative corrections to the background kinnersley tetrad to maintain vanishing newman ",
    "penrose curvature components @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the perturbed spacetime , the gravitational radiation is entirely encoded in the two curvature components @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( see also @xcite ) . the remaining non - zero component , @xmath7 , is intuitively associated with a coulombic part of the field , and is dominated by terms deriving from the stationary background .",
    "once the quasi - kinnersley frame has been identified in a radiation zone , its definition may then be carried into more general regions of spacetime using a continuity principle .",
    "the quasi - kinnersley frame is always one of the three transverse frames at _ any _ point of spacetime , whether that point lies in a radiation zone or not . in these transverse frames , the newman ",
    "penrose scalar @xmath7 will typically take three distinct values , only one of which will lead to a _ continuous _ function when compared with _",
    "known _ quasi - kinnersley values of @xmath7 at nearby points .",
    "the frame so chosen is the quasi - kinnersley frame .",
    "put another way , the key idea is that there is no ambiguity in identifying the quasi - kinnersley frame in a radiation zone , and maintaining continuity everywhere in spacetime generally determines a unique `` transverse frame field '' throughout .",
    "this is the quasi - kinnersley frame , defined globally .",
    "the results of this paper will indicate that there ought to be little doubt in practice concerning which value of @xmath7 will give the desired continuous extension .",
    "see the discussion for further comments .",
    "this paper will consider two curvature scalars defined using the quasi - kinnersley frame : @xmath8 each of these functions is understood to be defined on spacetime by evaluating the indicated newman ",
    "penrose curvature components _ in the quasi - kinnersley frame_. the first of these quantities , @xmath9 , is called the coulomb scalar .",
    "the nomenclature derives from intuition in the teukolsky formalism : @xmath7 is dominated by the stationary , coulombic field of the background kerr black hole .",
    "the second quantity , @xmath0 , is the bb radiation scalar . in a radiation zone accurately described by the teukolsky formalism",
    ", it manifestly depends only on the radiative degrees of freedom . although the components @xmath1 and @xmath2 are not separately preserved by the residual scaling transformations of the null tetrad allowed by the weyl curvature , their product is .",
    "thus , the bb scalar is a true invariant derived from spacetime curvature .",
    "although certainly not a radiation scalar , the coulomb scalar is still quite useful in our approach .",
    "first , as described above , demanding continuity of @xmath9 plays the key role in defining the quasi - kinnersley frame .",
    "we could also have used continuity of @xmath0 to do this , but @xmath0 is quadratic in the curvature while whereas @xmath9 is only linear .",
    "the radiation scalar therefore falls of much more rapidly ( @xmath10 ) at large distance than the coulomb scalar ( @xmath11 ) , making the numerical problem of determining continuity much harder .",
    "second , the coulomb scalar can be used to extract information about the single black hole underlying a perturbation - theoretic description of a given spacetime .",
    "thus , for example , it may be used at late times to determine , or at least constrain estimates of , the mass and spin of the final black hole resulting from coalescence in a background - independent way .",
    "numerical relativity is not primarily concerned with spacetime geometry .",
    "rather , it solves a cauchy problem for general relativity , calculating a series of spatial geometries parameterized by a fiducial time variable .",
    "these may then be assembled to form spacetime .",
    "the assembly procedure can of course be done analytically , and used to express the bb scalar in terms of given cauchy data .",
    "this has been done in paper i , and we describe the results here .    in a @xmath12 decomposition , the gravitational fields are expressed in terms of a spatial metric @xmath13 and an extrinsic curvature @xmath14 . the electric and magnetic components @xmath15 and @xmath16 of the spacetime weyl tensor can be computed from these data using @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the spatial projection of the stress energy tensor @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the spatial ricci tensor ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for more detail ) .",
    "the definition for the magnetic part of the spacetime weyl tensor depends on the convention used for the extrinsic curvature and for the spacetime volume element .",
    "we adopt here the convention that @xmath21 where @xmath22 denotes the lie derivative in the direction of the normal @xmath23 to the 3hypersurface .",
    "our convention for the spacetime volume element is @xmath24}\\ ] ] ( see paper i for more detail . )",
    "we next define the magnetic part of the spacetime weyl tensor @xmath25 by construction , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are both symmetric and traceless .",
    "we then define the complex tensor here differs from that used in paper i. at first glance , it would appear that the quantities we calculate here are therefore the complex conjugates of those calculated there . the difference , however , is illusory .",
    "our previous papers have tacitly assumed a definition for the extrinsic curvature with the opposite sign to that in eq .",
    "( [ k - def ] ) . while the previous convention is popular in the mathematical relativity community ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the current one is used more often in the numerical relativity community .",
    "we therefore adopt it here for the convenience of the latter . as a result of this shift of convention , the sign of the tensor @xmath26 defined above is reversed .",
    "we compensate this reversal in the definition of @xmath27 so that this tensor takes the exact same value on a cauchy slice with our new conventions as it did with the old . with this one modification ,",
    "all other formulae from the previous papers continue to hold unmodified . ]",
    "@xmath28 from which the scalar curvature invariants @xmath29 and @xmath30 can be computed as @xmath31 and @xmath32 once a basis is chosen , the tensor @xmath33 becomes simply a @xmath34 matrix . in ordinary linear algebra , it is well - known that any scalar invariant which may be extracted from such a matrix must be expressible as a function of three basic invariants . these basic invariants may be chosen to be the eigenvalues or , for example , the traces of the first three powers of the matrix in question .",
    "the trace of our matrix vanishes because it derives from the spacetime weyl tensor , and the traces of its square and cube are basically @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "thus , we should expect our coulomb and bb scalars may be expressed as functions of @xmath29 and @xmath30 . to do this , we recall the baker ",
    "campanelli speciality index @xcite defined by @xmath35 in terms of @xmath36 , the coulomb scalar can be written as @xmath37 where @xmath38 , while the bb scalar is @xmath39\\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath40 .",
    "in general , both the coulomb and bb scalars admit three distinct complex roots , associated with the three distinct transverse frames .",
    "we denote these three roots with the superscripts `` @xmath41 '' .",
    "the value in the principal branch of the root functions above has superscript @xmath42 , and this branch defines the quasi - kinnersley frame in an appropriate radiation zone .",
    "the other two branches have superscripts @xmath43 .",
    "either of these may be labeled the quasi - kinnersley value in the interior of spacetime , depending on what is needed to maintain continuity while coming in from the radiation zone .",
    "we will illustrate this point explicitly below .",
    "in addition to the direct calculation above , there are two other ways to compute @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the first is to solve the eigenvalue problem for the complex spatial tensor @xmath33 : @xmath46 as shown in paper i , the three eigenvalues @xmath47 turn out to be exactly twice the weyl scalar @xmath7 evaluated in the three transverse frames .",
    "thus , the coulomb scalar at any point of spacetime is always half of one of the eigenvalues of @xmath33 .",
    "if these eigenvalues are calculated , this approach does not say which is which , so it is not immediately clear which eigenvalue is associated with the principal branch of ( [ chi ] ) , and therefore with the quasi - kinnersley frame .",
    "however , it has been shown in paper ii that , among the three branches , the principal value has the largest modulus in a radiation zone .",
    "thus , the prescription to calculate the coulomb scalar is to take half the eigenvalue of largest modulus at large distances , and extend inward to strong - field regions always choosing the unique eigenvalue which keeps the function @xmath9 smooth . in a transverse frame , the newman ",
    "penrose weyl scalars @xmath5 and @xmath6 vanish by definition , and this gives a particularly simple relation between the coulomb and bb scalars : @xmath48 thus , if the coulomb scalar is known , the radiation scalar follows immediately .",
    "the second way to calculate the coulomb and bb scalars is to use series expansions of the exact formulae above .",
    "as shown in paper i , for a spacetime that asymptotically is perturbed about algebraic speciality , we can expand @xmath49,\\ ] ] and @xmath50.\\ ] ] these expansions explicitly use the principal values of the root functions in ( [ chi ] ) and ( [ xi ] ) , and therefore allow us to identify the quasi - kinnersley @xmath9 and @xmath0 asymptotically .",
    "this technique can be useful numerically when all three values @xmath51 become small .",
    "we illustrate this fact in sections [ bowen - york ] for bowen - york data and [ kasner ] for the kasner spacetime .",
    "probably the first example that comes to mind when evaluating a radiation scalar are pure wave solutions .",
    "unfortunately , the simplest such solution , plane waves , is too simple to be of interest .",
    "plane waves are petrov type n , and hence algebraically special . in a type n spacetime , a frame",
    "can always be found so that @xmath2 is the only non - vanishing weyl scalar .",
    "this frame is automatically transverse , so that @xmath52 vanishes identically .",
    "as the bb scalar is frame - independent , it vanishes also in all other , non - canonical frames . in a plane wave spacetime",
    "the bb scalar vanishes despite the presence of gravitational radiation .",
    "we therefore turn to two less trivial examples , namely linearized time - symmetric einstein ",
    "rosen cylindrical gravitational waves in section [ einstein - rosen ] and linearized even - parity quadrupole teukolsky waves in section [ teukolsky ] .",
    "the metric for einstein ",

    "symmetry @xmath58 , @xmath14 vanishes identically , which greatly simplifies the problem .",
    "the only non - vanishing term in the electric ( [ e ] ) or magnetic ( [ b ] ) components of the weyl tensor is then the ricci tensor @xmath20 in the electric part @xmath15 , which yields @xmath69 to linear order in @xmath53 ( all other components vanish . ) at @xmath58 we therefore have @xmath70 . using ( [ i ] ) and ( [ j ] )",
    "we find the curvature invariants @xmath71 and @xmath72 and from ( [ s ] ) the specialty index @xmath73 we plot the specialty index @xmath36 as a function of @xmath74 in the upper panel of fig .",

    "interestingly , @xmath36 is independent of the wave amplitude @xmath53 and therefore does not provide a measure of the strength of the gravitational radiation .",

    "we can see that the speciality index @xmath36 must be independent of the wave amplitude whenever the coulomb scalar is perturbative and scales with @xmath53 , while the bb scalar scales with @xmath75 .",
    "we find the same behavior for the teukolsky waves in section [ teukolsky ] .    for the remainder of this section",
    "we determine the coulomb scalar @xmath9 and the bb radiation scalar @xmath0 explicitly as functions of @xmath74 , adopting the following strategy .",
    "there are three regions for which the spacetime is close to speciality , i.e. , for which @xmath76 : @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig : er ] . )",
    "we then identify @xmath9 with an eigenvalue of @xmath33 .",
    "specifically , we require that at asymptotically great distances ( @xmath77 ) the expansion ( [ chi_expansion ] ) holds , and then identify @xmath9 with an eigenvalue of @xmath33  which is equivalent to picking a particular branch in the cubic roots in ( [ chi ] ) . from @xmath9",
    "we can then compute @xmath0 using ( [ alternative_xi ] ) . finally , we require continuity and differentiability as we move to smaller and smaller values of @xmath80 .    before we proceed we list the three eigenvalues of @xmath81 , which we denote @xmath82 and @xmath83 , @xmath84 notice that @xmath85 and @xmath86 as expected .    to find @xmath9 and @xmath0 we examine the asymptotic region @xmath77 . in this limit , @xmath87 and @xmath88 so that ( [ chi_expansion ] ) yields @xmath89 this the quasi - kinnersley @xmath9 .",
    "we compare this result with the limiting values of the three eigenvalues ( [ eigenvalues ] ) of the tensor @xmath90 , @xmath91 the eigenvalue that corresponds to @xmath9 is the one that satisfies @xmath92 , and therefore we conclude that for @xmath77 , the correct eigenvalue is @xmath83 .",

    "this suggests that it does indeed provide a reasonable measure of the gravitational wave content of these data .",

    "we explain this apparent contradiction by noting the absence of a radiation zone in the kasner spacetime .",

    "would engender a fresh set of difficulties , originating in the fundamental discreteness of the variables involved and the associated subtlety in obtaining the required _ smooth _ extension of the quasi - kinnersley frame into the strong - field regions of the initial data set .",
    "a full discussion of these issues lies outside the scope of this paper , and will be addressed elsewhere . however , we must make some comment here . to illustrate the resolution we envision to these difficulties in actual numerical work , we examine the results of figure [ fig : er-3chi ] in the appendix .",
    "these figures show all three values of the coulomb and bb scalars , appropriately scaled to give dimensionless quantities , for linearized einstein  rosen waves of flat spacetime . at large radii ,",

    "this is the principal branch of @xmath0 , and is associated with the quasi - kinnersley frame in this region . moving inward ,",
    "there are three critical points where we must be careful , at @xmath234 , @xmath125 and @xmath235 .",
    "the outermost critical point poses no real problem since the root we had been tracking , @xmath236 , is visibly discontinuous there . if we were moving inward in a numerical spacetime , calculating eigenvalues of the tensor @xmath33 with sufficiently small radial steps",
    ", there is no way we would be confused about which eigenvalue was appropriate just inside @xmath234 .",
    "inside this first critical point , we would naturally be tracking the dashed root , rather than the dotted .",
    "the next critical point , at @xmath237 poses a greater difficulty .",
    "the discontinuity there occurs in the derivative of the coulomb scalar , rather than in the scalar itself , and could therefore be harder to detect in numerical data .",
    "however , even in this case , there is a simple resolution to the problem",
    ". we would be able to recognize numerically that the eigenvalue we are interested in , associated with the dashed curve , is degenerating with another , associated with the solid curve .",
    "there are then at least two things we could do to make sure the coulomb scalar remains smooth at this critical point .",
    "one would be to use higher - order approximants , such as splines based on @xmath9-values at several grid points in each direction around the critical point , to explore which branch we ought to pick to preserve smoothness .",
    "an even simpler approach would be to exploit the known analytic structure of the riemann surface underlying the multi - valued complex function underlying @xmath9 .",
    "that structure is described in detail in papers i and ii . essentially , this approach would boil down to calculating how the speciality index @xmath36 varies in a neighborhood of the critical point , and mapping spacetime in that neighborhood into the riemann surface .",
    "the critical point itself occurs where @xmath36 lies exactly on the branch line we have chosen for @xmath9 . as @xmath36 crosses that branch line ,",
    "there is no ambiguity at this level in how the branch of @xmath9 ought to change to preserve analyticity .",
    "thus , once we have detected the possible presence of such a critical point in numerical data , we could use the explicit formula of ( [ chi ] ) and the local structure of the function @xmath36 on spacetime to predict the exact eigenvalue which corresponds to the quasi - kinnerlsey frame at every grid - point nearby .",
    "the third critical point , at @xmath238 poses no difficulty whatsoever . at this point ,",
    "the quasi - kinnersley value is associated with the solid curve , and it is the other two which are discontinuous . we would scarcely notice this in actual numerical work .",
    "the einstein ",
    "rosen example discussed here is actually quite useful .",
    "the three critical points we have observed in this example typify the only three kinds of critical points which can occur in a general spacetime , whether numerical or analytic in origin .",
    "the above discussion shows how these three types of critical point may be handled using a combination of simple numerical tests and insights from the analytical development of the radiation scalar approach .",
    "although further testing will doubtless be required in developing general numerical implementations , these observations are encouraging for the ultimate viability of this approach in numerical relativity .    a second question which lies outside the scope of the present paper , but which we nonetheless ought to address briefly here , concerns how the radiation scalar",
    "could potentially be used in discriminating among potential choices of initial data .",
    "consider , for example , initial data describing a compact binary at small binary separation . as we have discussed before",
    ", these data will presumably contain `` astrophysically sound '' radiation together with the `` junk radiation '' that we would like to minimize .",
    "such initial data can be constructed using different approaches , namely different decompositions of the constraint equations and different choices for the freely specifiable background geometry .",
    "different choices lead to physically distinct solutions @xcite with distinct gravitational wave content .",
    "our comparison of kerr and bowen  york data for rotating black holes in section [ rbh ] illustrates how the bb radiation scalar may be used as a diagnostic for comparing the amount of gravitational waves that these initial data sets would emit when evolved dynamically .",
    "we find in the analytical examples considered here that the bb radiation scalar scales as expected with a parameter that controls the gravitational wave content of these examples .",
    "such a parameter may not exist in numerically generated initial data sets , in which case it may be less clear how any non - zero value of @xmath0 should be interpreted .",
    "the bb radiation scalar may nevertheless be a useful diagnostic .",
    "even for a single initial data set the ratio @xmath239 would provide a dimensionless measure of the strength of the `` radiative '' fields compared to the `` coulombic '' fields .",
    "perhaps more importantly , it may be useful to compare @xmath0 for different initial data sets that approximate the same physical situation .",
    "for example , such a comparison may provide some guidance for deciding which choices in the construction of initial data sets yields a more truthful representation of binary black holes or neutron stars at small binary separations .",
    "we can envision various different ways of how such a comparison could be made .",
    "one potentially useful approach would focus on the radiation zone , where we have reliable intuition about how the real radiation content ought to fall off . comparing",
    "the fall - off behavior with that of the bb radiation scalar may help distinguish this `` astrophysically sound '' radiation content from the `` junk '' content and minimize the latter .    as a word of caution , however , we point out that such a comparison can at best provide some guidance rather than conclusive evidence .",
    "it is possible that the individual radiation fields @xmath1 and @xmath2 change in such a way that their product @xmath52 decreases even though the true radiation content increases",
    ". however , for many generic sets ( or families ) of initial data this may not be the case . since a diagnostic providing conclusive evidence is not yet available",
    ", we therefore believe that the bb radiation scalar may in the meantime provide some useful guidance as long as we keep these caveats in mind .",
    "we finally discuss some further limitations of this approach .",
    "while the bb radiation scalar @xmath0 contains some measure of gravitational wave content , it is not clear immediately how this information can be translated into gravitational wave templates that might be useful for gravitational wave observers .",
    "specifically such observers would presumably measure the gravitational wave amplitudes @xmath240 and @xmath241 in a transverse - traceless frame . in the linearized examples we have studied here , both the intuitive gravitational wave content and the bb radiation scalar scales with the square of a parameter describing intuitively the strength of the waves being modeled .",
    "this does not mean , however , that @xmath0 is proportional to the energy of the gravitational wave .",
    "in general the latter scales with @xmath242 in the appropriate basis , while @xmath52 . since @xmath1 and @xmath2 have different fall - off behavior , @xmath0 also falls off differently from both the gravitational wave amplitude or energy . in short , although @xmath0 describes only the radiative degrees of freedom , @xmath0 does not carry with it _ all _ the information  or even sufficient information  about the gravitational waves required by observers .",
