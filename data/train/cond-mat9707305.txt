    "high - temperature superconductors@xcite a wide range of behaviour atypical@xcite of the standard band - theory of metals , since at half filling they should be metals while they happen to be insulators .",
    "then , correlations are important .",
    "this leads us to consider that the theory of strongly correlated fermin systems plays an important role for the pairing mechanism and other properties of the cuprates@xcite .",
    "the current strategy ( due to anderson)@xcite to address the problem of high-@xmath3 superconductivity is to try to find a theory accounting for the normal state properties of the cuprates .",
    "this goes in analogy with the ordinary bcs theory where firstly the normal state is identified to be a landau fermi liquid metal and then is found an electron pairing mechanism ( unknown up to now in the cuprates ) which destabilizes the normal state phase towards a superconducting state . in particular , due to their pronounced two - dimensional character the one - band hubbard hamiltonian of the cu-3d hole states has been taken as one of the essential models@xcite .",
    "the hubbard model is the simplest many - particle model one can write down , which can not be reduced to a single - particle theory@xcite . to study this model ,",
    "the simultaneous evaluation of the frequency and momentum dependence of the one- and two - particle green functions is crucial .",
    "here , we adopt the opposite view of infinite dimensions@xcite which neglects the important role of spatial correlations .",
    "the hubbard model has been a subject of intense numerical studies . in spite of exact diagonalization and quantum monte carlo studies@xcite ,",
    "these methods are restricted to indeed small finite size systems .",
    "another route which takes both dynamical as well as momentum space correlation into account is the use of diagrammatic approaches@xcite .",
    "we should mention the self - consistent summation of all bubble and ladder diagrams , so called fluctuation exchange approximation , or flex@xcite,@xcite .",
    "this approximation ( flex ) is conserving in the sense of baym and kadanoff@xcite , i.e. , it is consistent with microscopic conservation laws for particle number , energy , and momentum .",
    "we recall that the flex approximation belongs to the class of @xmath4-derivable approximations which have been discussed a long time ago by wortis@xcite in the context of perturbative series expansion of thermodynamic properties of models described by lattice hamiltonians , mainly the ising model .",
    "wortis@xcite gives a set of steps to construct a @xmath4-derivable approximation .    in the flex approximation",
    "there is an interesting feature in the effective interaction : it is temperature and doping dependent through the spin susceptibility , @xmath5 .",
    "the effective interaction depends on the properties of the quasiparticles .",
    "one thus has a system in which , since the effective interaction both modifies the quasi - particle behavior and is itself alterated by that changed quasi - particle behavior , non - linear feedback , either positive or negative , can play a significant role@xcite .",
    "according to the flex approach , the dominant contribution to the magnetic interaction between planar quasi - particles is assumed to come from spin - fluctuation exchange , and so will be proportional to @xmath5 . in the scheme of pines and co - workers@xcite",
    ", @xmath5 is taken from experiments , while in the present work we have a fully self - consistent close set of equations to solve .",
    "recently , schmalian , langer , grabowski and bennemann@xcite have performed the calculation of the dynamical properties on the real axis , instead of the matsubara frequencies . here",
    "we perform our calculations on the matsubara axis ( 1024 frequencies ) obtaining the dynamical properties for all frequency range after analytically continuing the one- and two - particle green functions with pad approximants@xcite .",
    "our method for solving numerically the flex equations is based on the fast fourier tranformation ( fft)@xcite which is suitable for the evaluation of the corresponding integrals .",
    "we refer to reference@xcite where this technique is documented . in order to reach high densities , while working on the imaginary time , we have started from small densities ( or low chemical potential ) .",
    "for each value of the chemical potential we have reached self - consistency and then we move in small steps to a higher chemical potential .",
    "we have proceeded this way since the next green function is constructed from the nearby previous one .",
    "so , we always stay close to the real solution until we reach the density we are looking for .    in section [ eqsmot ]",
    "we describe our model hamiltonian and the flex equations to be solved on the imaginary time . in section",
    "[ 3 ] , we present the data for the one- and two - particle spectral functions , the self - energy and density of states .",
    "it is observed the formation of three branches in the spectral density .",
    "we analyze , following the self - consistency of our equations , the presence of these two peaks as due to the presence of two peaks in the imaginary part of the effective interaction .",
    "we have compared our solutions with a low order approximation which consists in approximating the internal green functions by free ones .",
    "our results show that the calculations agree globally with each other for small densities .",
    "the dynamical quantities are radically different for the density / spin investigated in this paper ( @xmath6 ) . in section",
    "[ 4 ] we discuss our result and present our conclusions .",
    "the hubbard hamiltonian is defined as @xmath7 where the @xmath8(@xmath9 ) are creation ( annihilation ) operators for electrons with spin @xmath10 .",
    "the number - operator is @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the hopping matrix element between nearest neighbours @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the on - site interaction and @xmath16 is the chemical potential in the grand canonical ensemble . here",
    "we consider a repulsive interaction , @xmath17 .",
    "the one - particle green function is expressed in terms of the self - energy , @xmath18 , by @xmath19 where @xmath20 . the self - energy of the hubbard model ( eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) ) within the flex approximation is given as follows@xcite @xmath21 where the effective interaction , @xmath22 , resulting from the summation of the bubble and ladder diagrams ( particle - hole channel ) , is given by @xmath23    here , @xmath24 is the particle - hole bubble with the renormalized green function @xmath25 . @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the fermionic ( odd ) and bosonic ( even ) matsubara frequencies .",
    "let s state that the bubble and ladder sums represent the charge and longitudinal and the transversal spin fluctuations , respectively .",
    "the effect of particle - particle fluctuations ( cooper channel ) has been left out of the present study .",
    "the previous set of equations closes with the expression for the @xmath28 given by    @xmath29    the form of eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) is well suited for numerical calculations .",
    "it has been justified by schafroth , rodrguez - nez and beck@xcite .",
    "( [ rho ] ) represents a generalization of mahan s eq .",
    "( 3.1.2)@xcite . eqs .",
    "( [ dyson]-[rho ] ) constitute the standard set of flex equations which have to be solved selfconsistently .    in order to obtain results which are independent of finite size",
    ", one should use at least some @xmath30 matsubara frequencies and a grid of @xmath31 lattice points .",
    "the above scheme works in principle but a closer look at the equations for @xmath32 and @xmath33 shows that the straight forward implementation of these equations does not work in practice .",
    "this is due to the 4fold loops which would occur in the computer program .",
    "suppose we use 2000 matsubara frequencies and a @xmath31 grid .",
    "then we have to carry out for every grid point and every frequency the double sum over all frequencies and all grid points .",
    "this are of the order @xmath34 complex operations .",
    "even a typical super - computer would need one to several hours to make one iteration step .",
    "since the frequency and momentum summations are convolutions , we evaluate them using the fast fourier transform ( fft ) . in order to do that we need to transform the flex equations to direct space - time .",
    "for example , eqs .",
    "( [ bubble],[selfenergy ] ) adopt the following forms    @xmath35    and @xmath36    in order be self - consistent , we calculate the frequency integrals on the imaginary time following a different approch to the one of schmalian et al@xcite . according to our experience ,",
    "it is much better to work with matsubara frequencies due to the fact that we have to handle neither fermi nor bose distribution functions .",
    "as we have previously said in the introduction we have reached high densities by moving from a selfconsistent solution to another close by .",
    "in other words , we do not need going to real frequencies to have stability in our algorithm . in section",
    "[ 3 ] we present our results , making special emphasis on the the way we have reached high densities ( see fig .",
    "in fig . 1 we present the density / spin , @xmath28 , as function of chemical potential , @xmath16 , for @xmath37 and a temperature of @xmath1 .",
    "( this temperature is slightly above the temperature used in ref.@xcite of schmalian et al .",
    "we have chosen this temperature since we can recover the asymptotic behavior , i.e. , @xmath38 .",
    "for @xmath39 we need to increase the number of matsubara frequencies ( we would need to go to ram memories of 100 mb or higher ) in order to reach the asymptotic behavior . this asymptotic behavior is needed in order to compute the fast fourier transforms . in this figure",
    "we also show the the equivalent results for a low order approximation which consists in replacing in eqs .",
    "( [ selfenergy]-[bubble ] ) the full one - particle green function , @xmath25 , by the one - particle free green function , @xmath40 .",
    "this approximation was proposed by serene and hess@xcite .",
    "we observe that the two curves almost coincide for low densities . for high densities ,",
    "this is not the case , as we will see shortly . at this point",
    "we would like to emphasize that the way we have reached high densities settles the apparent drawbacks of the calculations of the @xmath41-matrix approach which is a lower order approximation to flex .",
    "there is recent calculation by kagan et al@xcite where they have performed analytical calculations for the negative hubbard model in the frame of the @xmath42matrix approximation .      for comparison , in fig .",
    "3 , we present the spectral densities for the low order approximation .",
    "we observe that the peak structure is more pronunced than in the interacting case .",
    "this effect is also seen in the self - energy which we show next .    in fig .",
    "4 we display the imaginary part of the self - energy , @xmath55 $ ] , along the diagonal of the brillouin zone .",
    "the parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "we observe that energy dependence of @xmath55 $ ] , close to the chemical potential ( the chemical potential is located at @xmath56 ) , has a gap - like structure .",
    "@xmath55 $ ] has a well defined gap structure close to the chemical potential ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "we also see two almost symmetric peaks for every moment @xmath58 .",
    "this presents a difference with respect to the attractive hubbard model at small densities . for the attractive hubbard model at small densities",
    ", there was a single peak in frequency for all values of @xmath58 .",
    "this single peak structure in @xmath55 $ ] was fitted by a two - pole ansatz for the one - particle green function . from fig .",
    "4 we conclude that , for the studied temperature , we have a fermi liquid system , since im@xmath59 for @xmath44 close to the chemical potential .",
    "we agree with wermbtex@xcite even when his calculation is mean - field like . see the discussion of fig .",
    "5 .    in fig . 5 ( a )",
    "we present the same quantity , @xmath55 $ ] vs @xmath44 , for the low order approximation .",
    "we inmediately see a well defined gap for high momenta . in consequence ,",
    "the effect of fluctuations is to reduce the exaggerated gap of the non - selfconsistent solution .",
    "replacing our internal lines by free green functions is equivalent to stay close to mean - field treatments , as it has been done by kampf and schrieffer@xcite .",
    "these authors find well defined gaps in the spectral density which are most likely due to their mean field treatment .",
    "the approach mentioned in ref.@xcite has been critically studied by monthoux@xcite . in fig . 5 ( b ) we show @xmath60 $ ] vs @xmath44 . here",
    "the gap is present for all the momenta .",
    "as it has been said in the introduction the effective potential is strongly momentum and frequency dependent .",
    "we show in figs . 6 and 7 the imaginary and real parts of the effective potential , respectively , for the same set of parameters as given in fig . 2 along the diagonal of the brillouin zone .",
    "we observe that @xmath61 $ ] ( @xmath62 $ ] ) is basically odd ( even ) in frequency around the chemical potential .",
    "this symmetry around zero is due to the fact that the hartree shift ( hs ) has been substracted from the effective interaction .",
    "the real part of the effective interaction , i.e. , @xmath63 $ ] vs @xmath44 compares qualitately well with fig .",
    "19(a ) of ref.@xcite .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite have plotted the irreducible spin susceptibility , @xmath64 vs @xmath44 for some values of @xmath65 .",
    "as the peaks of @xmath69 $ ] are symmetric in energies , then both terms of eq .",
    "( [ realw ] ) contribute .",
    "as @xmath69 $ ] is antisymmetrical for frequencies close to @xmath16 where @xmath43 has a peak , then we have two contributions to @xmath70 $ ] . indeed , the numerical results for any @xmath58 of the self - energy mirror the behavior of @xmath71 .",
    "thus , the two - particle spectrum is introduced into the one - particle quantities like @xmath72 and @xmath43 .",
    "the flex approximation , a baym - kadanoff generalization of hartree - fock theory , has been implemented to study the frequency and momentum dependence of the one- and two - particle correlation functions .",
    "we have found the existence of three peaks in the one - particle spectral density , for the set of parameters investigated here .",
    "the presence of this structure in the spectral functions is a clear manifestation that correlations are indeed important . for smaller",
    "density / spin , for example @xmath73 ( fig .",
    "8) , we find that the spectral functions are almost single peaks , or free - like quasi - particles .",
    "we have compared our self - consistent calculation with a low order approximation which consists in replacing the internal one - particle green functions by free ones .",
    "the effects of the latter approximation are evident : the spectral functions are almost delta functions and the self - energy shows a wide gap around the chemical potential , which signals that this approximation is mean - field - like .",
    "we add that besides the good features present in the flex approximation@xcite , we have shed some light on another aspect of it , i.e. , the dependence of the one - particle properties on the two - particle green functions due to the self - consistency of the flex equations .",
    "we mention the work of nakamura , moriya and ueda@xcite and references therein where they point out the role of both the low and high frequency behavior of the spin fluctuations in the superconducting phase . for densities around half - filling correlations start to build in giving rise to three peaks in the energy spectrum .",
    "we argue that this analysis can be described in a generalized scheme of three - pole ansatz for the spectral function@xcite .",
    "work along these line is in progress@xcite in order to really resolve the three peaks in the one - particle spectral function .",
    "we should add that three peaks in the @xmath43 is equivalent to two peaks in the imaginary part of the self - energy . in this work",
    ", we have also discussed the differences of flex with respect to the @xmath41-matrix approximation .",
