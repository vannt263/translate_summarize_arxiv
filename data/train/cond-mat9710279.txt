    "glassy systems at low temperatures undergo a transition characterized by the freezing of structural relaxation , in which the system is trapped in a disordered metastable configuration . already at temperatures higher than the ideal glass transition temperature @xmath4 , a number of dynamical anomalies is observed .",
    "one of these anomalies concerns the relaxation functions of the system , which at high temperatures are characterized by a single exponential .",
    "below some temperature @xmath5 higher than @xmath4 , the long time regime of correlation functions , called @xmath6-relaxation , is well approximated by a kohlrausch - williams - watts function , also known as `` stretched exponential '' , @xmath7 this behavior has been observed in many real glasses , such as ionic conductors , supercooled liquids and polymers .",
    "a similar behavior has been observed in canonical metallic and insulating spin glasses , investigated by neutron and hyperfine techniques @xcite .",
    "these systems can be described by an ising model , in which ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions are distributed in a disordered way on the edges of the lattice .",
    "the ising spin glass undergoes a transition at some temperature @xmath8 , called spin glass transition , analogous to the freezing transition of real glasses .",
    "moreover , like in glass - forming systems , one observes a temperature value @xmath9 where non - exponential relaxation functions appear .",
    "this has been observed for the ising spin glass in 2d by mcmillan @xcite , and in 3d by ogielski @xcite .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the onset of non exponential relaxation functions like ( [ eq_stretched ] ) in spin glasses , when the system approaches the glass transition from above .",
    "@xcite suggest that the temperature @xmath5 coincides with @xmath10 , the critical temperature of the ferromagnetic model .",
    "they base their conjecture on the presence , in the spin glass , of non frustrated ferromagnetic - type clusters of interactions , the same that are responsible for the griffiths singularity @xcite .",
    "the presence of non exponential relaxation in this approach is therefore a direct consequence of the quenched disorder .",
    "on the other hand , it has been suggested @xcite that in the spin glass the onset of stretched exponential relaxation functions may coincide with the percolation temperature @xmath0 of the kasteleyn - fortuin and coniglio - klein clusters @xcite .",
    "these clusters can be obtained introducing bond with probability @xmath11 between nearest - neighbor pair of spins satisfying the interaction . in the spin glass",
    "the percolation threshold of these clusters is higher than @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "moreover stauffer @xcite observes non exponential relaxation in the @xmath12 ferromagnetic ising model , simulated by conventional spin flip , for temperatures lower than the critical temperature @xmath10 , which coincides with the percolation temperature @xmath0 . in @xmath13",
    "this behavior disappears , and the relaxation is purely exponential for all the temperatures .    to gain more insight into the mechanisms which lead to the appearing of anomalies in the dynamical behavior , in this paper we study the fully frustrated ising model @xcite on a bidimensional square lattice , using the conventional spin flip techniques . in this model",
    "ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions are distributed in a regular way on the lattice ( see fig . [ fig_fully ] ) , so that no unfrustrated cluster of interactions exists . therefore in this model",

    "this model , which can be generalized to any value of @xmath1 , is suitable to describe systems with geometrical frustration , and may give insight into the origin of the long relaxation decay in glasses , characterized by stretched exponentials @xcite .",

    "we expect that the model ( [ eq_partition ] ) exhibits two critical points @xcite .",
    "the first at a temperature @xmath49 , corresponding to the percolation of the bonds on the lattice , in the same universality class of the ferromagnetic @xmath15-state potts model . the other at a lower temperature @xmath50 , in the same universality class of the fully frustrated ising model .",
    "in the bidimensional case @xmath51 @xcite .",
    "a particular configuration of the model defined by ( [ eq_partition ] ) is determined by the state of each edge between two nearest - neighbor sites , that can be empty or occupied by a bond .",
    "the dynamics of the model is carried out in the following way : ( i ) choose at random a particular edge on the lattice ; ( ii ) calculate the probability @xmath52 of changing its state , that is of creating a bond if the edge is empty , and of destroying the bond if the edge is occupied ; ( iii ) change the state of the edge with probability @xmath52 .",
    "the point ( ii ) needs the knowledge of a non local property , namely if a bond placed on the chosen edge closes a loop or not , and if the loop is frustrated or not .",
    "this is accomplished in the following way : starting from the two sites at the extremes of the edge , visit the clusters of sites connected to them by a continuous path of bonds ; if the clusters collide the bond closes a loop , otherwise it does not . taking track of",
    "the number of antiferromagnetic bonds traversed visiting the cluster , one can determine also if the loop is frustrated or not .    note",
    "that at high temperatures clusters are small , and are visited in a few iterations , while at low temperatures density of bonds is high , and the clusters collide in a few iterations as well . on the other hand at the percolation transition clusters are very ramified , and",

    "so it is interesting to compare the relaxation functions of this model to those of the corresponding fully frustrated ising model , simulated by standard spin flip techniques .",

    "we have studied the fully frustrated ising model and the fully frustrated percolation model .",
    "the dynamics of the models was analysed in detail , in connection with the problem of the onset of stretched exponentials in frustrated systems , like glasses and spin glasses .    due to absence of disorder in these models , the arguments suggested by randeria _",
    "et al . _ , which predict a non - exponential relaxation below the critical temperature @xmath10 of the corresponding ferromagnetic model ,",

    "in fact our results show no sign of complex dynamical behavior at @xmath10 .",
    "we find instead an exponential relaxation above the percolation temperature @xmath107 , while for @xmath108 the long time tail of the relaxation functions can be fitted with a stretched exponential .",
    "so we conclude that at least in the models without disorder the appearance of complex dynamics is related to a percolation transition . in systems like spin glasses @xmath0 and @xmath10 are very close , and it is difficult to distinguish numerically where the onset of non exponential relaxation occurs .",
    "we also find that frustration plays an important role in the critical properties at the percolation threshold @xmath0 .",
    "for example , for @xmath2 the critical behavior is in the same universality of the ferromagnetic @xmath3-state potts model , contrary the unfrustrated case , which corresponds to random bond percolation and is in the same universality class of the @xmath2 ferromagnetic potts model .",
    "we have also considered a model , the locally frustrated bond percolation , in which only loops up to length four are considered frustrated .",
    "the model shows the same critical properties as the random bond percolation , showing that the frustration is `` too local '' to change the universality class .",
    "similarly , the relaxation functions in the long time regime can always be fitted with an exponential , showing that the frustration constraint is not enough to give rise to stretched exponential relaxation .",
    "more careful study of this model , possibly varying the `` range '' of the frustration between the size of the single _ plaquette _ , and that of the whole system , may shed more light on the role played by the frustration in the dynamics of complex systems .",

    "<S> nevertheless we find numerically that the model exhibits a stretched exponential behavior below a temperature @xmath0 corresponding to the percolation transition of the kasteleyn - fortuin clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we have also found that the critical behavior of this clusters for a fully frustrated @xmath1-state spin model at the percolation threshold is strongly affected by frustration . </S>",
    "<S> in fact while in absence of frustration the @xmath2 limit gives random percolation , in presence of frustration the critical behavior is in the same universality class of the ferromagnetic @xmath3-state potts model . </S>"
