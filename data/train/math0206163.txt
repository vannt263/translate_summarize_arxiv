    "the change - of - basis equations with respect to the @xmath300 have the form @xmath315 with @xmath316 for all @xmath317 .    since the entry of @xmath318 in row @xmath319 column @xmath104 is equal to the number of cosets @xmath120 of young subgroups of shape @xmath7 containing both @xmath319 and @xmath104 , we clearly have @xmath320 for any @xmath308 showing that @xmath318 lies in @xmath86 .",
    "next , note that the column space of @xmath318 is equal to that of @xmath310 so that , by corollary  [ cslambda ] , @xmath321 if @xmath138 and @xmath322 otherwise .",

    "now consider the coefficients @xmath323 .",
    "the @xmath324-entry of @xmath318 is non - zero if and only if there is some coset of some young subgroup of shape @xmath7 which contains both @xmath319 and @xmath104 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath325 is an element of that young subgroup .",
    "but the conjugacy classes @xmath88 which intersect a young subgroup of shape @xmath10 are precisely those for which @xmath326 is a refinement of @xmath10 .",

    "following terwilliger  @xcite , we call the basis @xmath330 a _ split basis _ for the association scheme of @xmath14",
    ". we remark , however , that the typical linear ordering on relations and primitive idempotents is replaced in this case by the partial order @xmath331 .    in the language of association schemes ,",
    "a @xmath7-transitive set @xmath36 is the same as a delsarte @xmath332-design  ( * ? ? ?",

    "this provides another viewpoint for our investigation and suggests an avenue for finding future non - existence results .",
    "we remark that delsarte s linear programming bound  the most obvious technique in this regard  is mostly ineffective in this particular setting , being overshadowed by the following more elementary divisibility conditions on @xmath7-transitive sets .",
    "[ pdivis ] if @xmath35 is a @xmath7-transitive set of permutations , then @xmath334 is divisible by @xmath335 for any partition @xmath138 .    since @xmath36",

    "we also ask if @xmath341 can be combined with some small collection of its translates to yield a @xmath343-transitive set of permutations in @xmath340 .",
    "\\(2 ) is there an analogue of @xmath10-transitive groups and sets for other coxeter groups ?",
    "in particular , it would be interesting to investigate the hyperoctahedral group .",
    "one would hope that there is a generalization of theorem  [ tdlamu ] in this setting .",
    "\\(3 ) in view of proposition  [ pdivis ] , no @xmath10-transitive subset of @xmath14 can contain less than @xmath344 permutations .",
    "trivial examples where this lower bound is achieved are the cyclic , alternating and symmetric groups . at the end of section  [ sec : eg ] , we presented examples achieving this lower bound for @xmath345 where @xmath183 is an odd prime power .",
    "we ask if there are any other infinite families of examples achieving this lower bound .",
    "\\(4 ) the _ krein parameters _ @xmath346 of the association scheme of the symmetric group are defined by the equations @xmath347 where @xmath348 denotes the entrywise product of matrices . in the study of association schemes ,",
    "one is often interested in determining which krein parameters vanish for a given family of schemes .",
    "while this question is known to be hard in general , we identify one interesting result along these lines . using theorem 2.9.22 on p99 of the book by james and kerber  @xcite",
    ", we find that the krein parameter @xmath349 vanishes if @xmath350 where @xmath351 .",
