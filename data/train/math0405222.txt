    "the particular properties of the long term dynamics of many complex and/or disordered systems have been the subject of great interest in the physics , and , increasingly , the mathematics community .",
    "the key paradigm here is the notion of _ ageing _ , a notion that can be characterised in terms of scaling properties of suitable autocorrelation functions .",
    "typically , ageing can be associated to the existence of _ infinitely many _ time - scales that are inherently relevant to the system . in that respect",
    "ageing systems are distinct from _ metastable _ systems which are characterised by a finite number of well separated time scales corresponding to the live times of different metastable states .",
    "ageing systems are rather difficult to analyse , both numerically and analytically .",
    "most analytical results , even on the heuristic level , concern either the langevin dynamics of spherical mean field spin glasses , or _ trap models _ , a class of artificial markov processes that in some way is to mimic the long term dynamics of highly disordered systems ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one of the natural questions one is led to ask when being confronted with phenomena related to multiple time scales is whether and how they can be related to _",
    "spectral properties_. this relationship has been widely investigated in the context of markov processes with metastable behaviour ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and it would be rather interesting to obtain a spectral characterisation of ageing systems as well , at least in the context of markov processes . to our knowledge , this problem has not been widely studied so far .",
    "the only paper dealing with the problem is the paper @xcite by butaud and melin that have tackled one of the simplest trap models and on which we will comment below , and @xcite and @xcite that investigate convergence to equilibrium in the random energy model ( rem ) .",
    "the present paper is intended to make a modest first step into this direction by analysing the relation between spectral properties and ageing rigorously in the rem - like trap model . while this model may seem misleadingly simple ,",
    "it has in the past provided valuable insights into the mechanisms of ageing , and it is our hope that the analysis presented here will provide useful guidelines for further investigations of more complicated models .",
    "the paper will be divided into two parts . in the first we analyse the rem - like trap model in the standard formulation of bouchaud @xcite . in the second part",
    "we go a step further and reformulate the model in a slightly different way as a markov process on a poisson point process .",
    "this formulation makes the relation to the real rem more suggestive ( see @xcite for a full analysis ) , and allows in a natural way to study the dynamics of the model on different time scales .",
    "let us begin to recall the definition of _ trap models _ as introduced by bouchaud and dean@xcite .",

    "rather recently , there have been a number of rigorous papers devoted to the analysis of trap models on the lattices @xmath23 @xcite and @xmath24 @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the simples trap model , called the _",
    "rem  like trap model _ @xcite that corresponds to choosing @xmath5 to be the complete graph on @xmath25 vertices i.e. @xmath26 and to take as energy landscape a family @xmath27 of independent exponential random variables with parameter @xmath28 such that @xmath29 . given @xmath30 ,",

    "setting @xmath35 the infinitesimal generator of the random walk is given by @xmath36 the dynamics can be described as follows : after reaching the state @xmath13 the system waits an exponential time of mean @xmath37 and then jumps with uniform probability to another state .",
    "although strictly speaking the mean waiting time is given by @xmath37 , we call @xmath38 waiting time ( the discrepancy is negligible in the thermodynamic limit @xmath39 ) .",
