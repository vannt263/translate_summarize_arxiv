    "hard x - ray surveys represent an efficient probe to unveil the super - massive black hole ( smbh ) accretion activity , which is recorded in the cosmic x - ray background ( xrb ) spectral intensity .",
    "the advent of hard x - ray ( i.e. , 210  kev ) imaging instruments , from asca to _ bepposax _ and , more recently , _",
    "chandra _ and , has provided a dramatic advance in the field of x  ray surveys .    the combination of deep / ultra - deep x  ray surveys with _ chandra _ ( alexander et al . 2003 ; giacconi et al .",
    "2002 ) and the shallower surveys with   ( baldi et al .",
    "2002 ) has allowed to resolve of the xrb in the band and to unveil classes of cosmic sources which were previously unknown or marginally represented by a few ambiguous and sparse cases .    within this context , the hellas2xmm survey plays an important role . using suitable  archival observations",
    ", this project aims at covering 4 square degrees of sky down to x  ray fluxes of the order of @xmath0 @xmath1 , sampling the bright tail of the x  ray luminosity function .",
    "the key scientific issue is a solid estimate of the luminosity function and evolution of the obscured agn responsible for a large fraction of the xrb . in order to fulfill the goals of such an ambitious objective , the spectroscopic identification of a large number of hard x ",
    "ray selected sources is mandatory .",
    "unfortunately the identification of a sizable fraction of optically faint obscured agn is already challenging the capabilities of the 810 m class telescopes calling for alternative approaches based on multiband optical photometry , detection of redshifted iron k@xmath2 lines , or statistical methods .",
    "some of the results obtained by our group in these regards , based on the multiwavelength observations of the hellas2xmm 1 degree field , will be briefly reported .",
    "about 20% of the sources detected in recent hard x - ray surveys have a large x - ray to optical ( @xmath3-band ) flux ratio ( x / o @xmath4 ) , i.e. , ten times or more higher than typically observed in optically selected agns ( fiore et al .",
    "2003 ; alexander et al .",
    "2001 ) the fraction of these sources seems to remain constant over @xmath5  3 decades of x - ray flux .",
    "fiore et al .",
    "( 2003 ) discovered a striking correlation between x / o and the 210 kev luminosity for the sources having strongly obscured nuclei in the optical band , i.e. not showing broad emission lines .",
    "the optical r band light of these objects is dominated by the host galaxy light , which spans a luminosity range much smaller ( about one fourth ) than the x - ray luminosity , giving rise to the above correlation .",
    "figure [ xolxz ] shows x / o as a function of the 210 kev luminosity for a sample of optically obscured agn in two redshift bins , below and above @xmath6=0.9 .",
    "the correlation between x / o and the 210 kev luminosity , though characterized by a not negligible scatter , is very strong in both redshift bins . at redshifts higher than 0.9",
    "most of the point with l(210 kev ) @xmath7 10@xmath8 erg s@xmath9 , corresponding to high luminosity , highly obscured type 2 qso , are from the hellas2xmm sample ( figure  1 right panel ) .",
    "the reason is that at the flux limit of the hellas2xmm sample several sources with x / o@xmath10 have optical magnitudes up to r @xmath11 2425 , bright enough to obtain reliable spectroscopic redshifts , while in the much deeper but smaller area surveys of the cdfn , cdfs and lockman hole , sources with x / o@xmath10 have fainter ( up to r @xmath11 29 ) optical magnitudes , unaccessible to spectroscopy even with 10 m class telescopes .",
    "indeed , we were able to obtain spectroscopic redshifts and classification of 13 out of the 28 hellas2xmm 1df sources with x / o@xmath4 ; _ 8 of them are type 2 qso at @xmath6=0.71.8 _ , to be compared with the similar number obtained from the combination of the cdfn and cdfs , at the expenses of a huge investment of vlt and keck observing time .",
    "for other 8 hellas2xmm sources with x / o@xmath10 a lower limit on their redshifts was obtained from their observed r ",
    "k color ( mignoli et al . 2004 ) and they nicely agree with the x / o  logl(210 kev ) correlation ( see the small open circles with arrows in figure [ xolxz ] ) . we conclude that the majority of the sources with x / o@xmath10 are type 2 qso at z@xmath12 , postulated in the simplest versions of xrb models based on agn unification schemes ( comastri et al .",
    "although only 20% of the x - ray sources have such high x / o , they may carry the largest fraction of accretion power from that shell of universe .",
    "large area ( of the order of several square degrees ) , medium  deep surveys like hellas2xmm may be the most efficent tool to fully uncover this still rather poorly known component of the agn population .     of the sources in the combined sample have x / o higher than this value .",
    "the diagonal line in the right panel is the best log(x / o)log(l@xmath13 ) linear regression in fiore et al .",
    "( 2003).,scaledwidth=90.0% ]",
    "the x - ray absorption properties of the hellas2xmm 1df sample have been studied in detail by perola et al .",
    "figure [ xonhf ] shows x / o as a function of the best fit , rest frame absorbing column for these sources .",
    "a strong correlation is clearly present between x / o and @xmath14 , i.e. optically obscured sources tend to be , on average , obscured also in x ",
    "rays , in agreement with unification schemes , although exceptions to this trend do exist . for istance",
    "x  ray absorption with column densities @xmath15 10@xmath16 in broad line type 1 agn has been reported ( see brusa et al ( 2003 ) and perola et al ( 2004 ) for more details ) .",
    "the distribution of the hellas2xmm 1df sources as a function of the 210 kev luminosity is shown in figure [ lxhisto ] for three logarithimic bins of the absorbing column density : @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the fraction of obscured sources in this sample is roughly constant with the luminosity .",
    "this is likely to be due to the rather narrow flux range ( about one decade ) covered by the hellas2xmm sample .",
    "going to fainter fluxes both lower luminosities and higher redshifts are sampled . as a consequence , the correlations between the fraction of obscured sources with the luminosity and/or the redshift start to emerge ( ueda et al .",
    "2003 , hasinger 2003 , la franca et al . in preparation ) .",
    "bins : white histogram = @xmath20 , gray histogram = @xmath21 and black histogram = @xmath22.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    figure [ lxhisto ] also shows that the fraction of high luminosity , highly obscured x - ray obscured objects can be as high as 40% ( see perola et al .",
    "2004 for details ) , which means @xmath23 deg@xmath24 at the flux limit of the hellas2xmm survey .",
    "to study the sources with high or extreme x / o in the hellas2xmm sample , and faint ( r@xmath25 ) optical counterparts in more detail , we have started a pilot program of deep near - infrared photometry ( @xmath26 ) using isaac@vlt .",
    "ten of the 11 sources with x / o @xmath7 10 observed in the @xmath27 band were detected ( @xmath28  18.4 ; mignoli et al .",
    "their optical - to - near - infrared colors are significantly redder than those of the field galaxy population , all of them being extremely red objects ( eros ; @xmath29 ) .",
    "the results of the analysis of the image profiles indicate that a pointlike nuclear source is present in a few objects only , the majority of the sources ( 7 out of 10 ) being well represented by a de vaucoulers profile .",
    "a redshift estimate has been obtained from the measured optical and near  infrared magnitudes ( see mignoli et al .",
    "2004 for a detailed description ) .",
    "briefly , the observed distribution of r  k colors of our sources is compared with that of the sub  sample of spectroscopically identified early  type galaxies in the k20 redshift survey ( cimatti et al . 2002 ) .",
    "a simple stellar population model which provides the reddest colors at each redshift has been then employed to assign a `` minimum '' redshift to each source . not surprisingly , given their eros color and k  band morphology , the 7 objects lie in the range 0.9 @xmath30 1.5 .",
    "the masses of the obscured smbh powering the x  ray source and hidden by the host galaxy starlight can be estimated from the relation between the black hole mass and the k  band luminosity of the bulge component as discussed by marconi & hunt ( 2003 ) .",
    "this approach returns an upper limit to the smbh mass , since it has been assumed that the measured k band light is completely dominated by the bulge component .",
    "the presence of a disk or a residual point  source contribution escaping detection in the azimuthally  averaged brightness profile would lower the bulge luminosity and in turn the mass determination .    the mass upper limits coupled with the unabsorbed 210 kev luminosities derived by perola et al . ( 2004 ) and with a prescription for the bolometric correction ( @xmath31 ) allow a straightforward calculation of the lower limits on the eddington ratio ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the correction factor needed to estimate the bolometric luminosity from the 210 kev band is subject to significant uncertainties and a robust estimate ( @xmath33 30 ) is available only for bright unobscured quasars ( elvis et al .",
    "lower values @xmath33 1020 are more appropriate for lower luminosities seyfert  like objects ( fabian 2003 ) and also appears to better reproduce the observed spectral energy distribution of a few heavily obscured sources ( comastri 2004 ) .",
    "given that we are dealing with lower limits of the eddington ratio a conservative value of @xmath31=10 has been assumed .",
    "the distribution of the smbh masses and l / l@xmath34 for the 7 galaxies are shown in figure [ peng ] .",
    "the present estimates obtained through a chain of assumptions and neglecting the uncertainties associated to each of them should be considered as indicative .    a more detailed bi ",
    "dimensional fit of the galaxy images is under way , to disentangle the different morphological component and to better constrain the different components and therefore the smbh mass ( donnarumma et al . in preparation ; mignoli et al . in preparation ) .",
    "the original matter presented in this paper is the result of the effort of a large number of people , in particular of the hellas2xmm team , which we warmely thank .",
