    "strong gravitational lenses , where multiple images of the background object are formed , are powerful probes of the distribution of mass in the universe .",
    "the properties of the lensed images are , in principle , sensitive only to the projected mass of the lensing object , with no requirements that the mass be luminous or baryonic ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "most of the lensing signal comes from the primary lensing object  typically a massive early - type galaxy  and , if the lensing object is a member of a galaxy cluster or group , its immediate environment",
    ".    however , the distribution of large - scale structure ( lss ) along the line of sight to the lens system adds perturbations to the lensing properties .",
    "for example , simulations have shown that a non - negligible fraction of lenses can only be produced by having multiple lens planes along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the differences in light travel times along rays forming the multiple lensed images in a given system can be affected at the level of a few percent ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or up to @xmath910% ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) by the distribution of lss along that particular line of sight",
    ". these effects should be random for random lines of sight , so it should be possible to reduce the lss uncertainties and exploit the power of gravitational lenses as cosmological tools by averaging over many systems . if , however , lenses lie along biased lines of sight , this reduction will not occur and global parameters such as @xmath5 determined from large lens samples will be biased .    to date",
    ", most observational investigations of the effects of the environment on strong lensing have focused on the local neighborhood of the lens by searching for spectroscopic evidence of galaxy groups and clusters that are physically associated with the lensing galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "some of these investigations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have also found mass concentrations along the line of sight that are at different redshifts than the lensing galaxy .",
    "however , due to the limitations imposed by requiring spectroscopic redshifts for their analyses , the spectroscopic surveys are necessarily incomplete samples of the line of sight .",
    "most also are also biased because they preferentially target galaxies expected to be at the redshift of the primary lens",
    ". there have also been photometric studies of lens fields in order to evaluate lens environments .",
    "these photometric investigations are the closest in concept to the analysis in this paper .",
    "however , they focused on either group finding via detection of red sequences @xcite , or on describing the immediate environment of the lensing galaxy by using galaxy colors to strongly favor galaxies likely to be at the redshift of the lens @xcite .",
    "none of these previous photometric studies evaluates the contributions by galaxies along the full line of sight . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the question of whether lens lines of sight are biased by comparing , through bayesian and frequentist statistics , the number counts of galaxies in fields containing gravitational lenses with those obtained from two control samples .",
    "the control samples are chosen to provide reasonable approximations to typical lines of sight through the universe .",
    "all images were obtained with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) aboard the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) .",
    "the underlying idea is that lines of sight that are overdense in galaxies are also overdense in mass , if the underlying redshift distributions are roughly the same .",
    "hence by simply counting galaxies , one can make conservative statements about the lines of sight towards lens galaxies that are not highly model - dependent .",
    "we discuss the sample selection and image processing in  2 , do a frequentist analysis of the samples in  3 , develop and use a bayesian framework for comparing the samples in  4 , briefly describe the number counts for individual lens systems ( as opposed to sample averages ) in  5 , and interpret the results in  6 .",
    "in this section we briefly describe the data reduction and catalogue extraction .",
    "the lens sample comprises 18 systems which were observed with acs as part of the cfa - arizona space telescope lens survey ( castles ; go-9744 ; pi kochanek ) .",
    "this sample was defined by taking the full list of lenses observed with acs as part of the castles program ( 24 galaxies in all ) and only including systems that ( 1 ) had total exposure times @xmath102000  s , ( 2 ) had no extremely bright stars in the field , and ( 3 ) had galactic latitudes of @xmath11 .",
    "each system was observed through the f555w and f814w filters , but for comparison with the control data sets , we only consider the f814w data .",
    "the typical total exposure times through the f814w filter were @xmath920003000  sec .",
    "details of the observations are given in table  1 .",
    "the pipeline - processed data were obtained from the multi - mission archive at space telescope , and the individual exposures were combined using the _ multidrizzle _ package @xcite .",
    "we also included in the lens sample deep acs images of b0218 + 357 ( go-9450 ; pi n.  jackson ) and b1608 + 656 ( go-10158 ; pi fassnacht ) , with total f814w exposure times of 48,720 and 28,144  sec , respectively . for easier comparison with the rest of the lens sample we only used the data from the first four f814w exposures on the b1608 + 656 field , with a combined integration time of 2528  sec .",
    "the lens galaxies are at moderate redshifts , with a mean and rms of @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "this should be compared to the environmental investigations of @xcite and @xcite , which focused on a lower redshift sample ( @xmath14 ) .",
    ".lens sample [ cols= \" < , > , < \" , ]      we calculate @xmath1 ( i.e. , the most likely average number density of galaxies ) for the lens and control fields as a function of the aperture size and magnitude .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig_aperture_counts ] and listed in table  [ tab_mu0 ] .",
    "figure  [ fig_aperture_counts ] shows significant differences between the values of @xmath1 obtained for the two control samples . especially in the magnitude",
    "bins corresponding to @xmath15 , the cosmos galaxy densities are systematically higher than those seen in the pure parallel fields .",
    "this result is similar to that obtained from the ks analysis ( table  [ tab_ks ] and figure  [ fig_cdf ] ) and also with the analysis by the cosmos team , which finds that the amount of structure in the cosmos field is at the high end of the range of variations produced by sample variance @xcite .",
    "it is also instructive to plot the results in terms of differences with respect to one of the samples . for this exercise ,",
    "the fiducial sample is set to the pure - parallel sample because the cosmos field appears to be biased high .",
    "figure  [ fig_delta_mu0 ] shows the resulting offsets in @xmath1 .",
    "two trends are seen in the plot : ( 1 ) for all apertures , the cosmos - field values of @xmath1 are higher than the pure - parallel values in the range @xmath16 , often at high significance , and ( 2 ) the lens fields often appear overdense compared to the pure - parallel fields , but the uncertainties on the lens values are so large that very few of the offsets are significantly different from zero .",
    "this result is consistent with our frequentist analysis of the data (  3 ) . only for the smallest aperture ( 159 )",
    "do we see a significant trend for the lens fields , with the three bins at @xmath17 all being @xmath18 higher than the pure parallel values .",
    "clearly , a much larger lens sample is needed .",
    "overall , we can conclude that over a wide range of apertures ( @xmath19 ) , the difference in the number of galaxies between lens and control field is less than @xmath96 galaxies .",
    "although this can be fractionally large , it clearly shows that on average only a few galaxies determine the difference between lens fields and non - lens fields in typical observations . for the smallest aperture of 159 ,",
    "the difference is typically @xmath20 galaxy at the 68% confidence level in any given magnitude bin .",
    "since these galaxies have most influence on the lens model , taking these galaxies in to account has most impact on the lens model .",
    "we thus conclude that , given the uncertainties imposed by the size of our current lens samples , lss variations do not make lens fields significantly overdense compared to non - lens fields . only if mass does not follow light on average for the lss could this conclusion be circumvented .",
    "[ fig_delta_mu0 ]      in the previous subsection we saw that over the entire range of aperture sizes and magnitude limits , the average difference in the number of galaxies seen in the lens and control fields is typically @xmath21 for aperture sizes of 45 , integrated over all magnitudes ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig_delta_mu0 ] ) .",
    "strangely , even though the pointings in both sets control fields are random ( i.e. not centered on a bright galaxy ) , in the case of the cosmos fields one often finds more galaxies than in the lens fields . this might be due to the fact that , unlike either the lens or pure - parallel fields , the cosmos region is a contiguous field that may not be a representative sample of the universe ( i.e. , it may be overdense ) . compared to the pure parallel fields , the lens fields are often slightly overdense , albeit at low significance .",
    "based on the expectation values in table 3 , we calculate that the integrated ( over magnitude ) excess numbers of galaxies in the lens fields compared to the pure - parallel fields are @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively , for the 45 , 318 , 225 and 159 apertures .",
    "this excess is not unexpected because the massive lens galaxies typically reside in _ locally _ overdense regions and , in principle , one would expect more galaxies in their neighborhood . to quantify the effect of local overdensities , we use the two - point correlation function of @xcite and",
    "find predicted excesses ( integrated over magnitude ) of 2.0 , 1.3 , 0.9 and 0.6 galaxies , respectively , for the same apertures .",
    "after correcting for galaxy clustering , the difference between the lens and pure - parallel ( or cosmos ) fields becomes insignificant , with differences only at the @xmath91-@xmath3 level .",
    "we thus conclude that any line - of - sight overdensities in the lens fields , already being marginal , become insignificant when the local overdensities around the lens galaxies are accounted for .",
    "to test the validity of the two - point correlation correction , we compared two sets of number counts derived from cosmos .",
    "the first set is the one that we have used as the the first control sample , with number counts computed in grids of apertures placed on each cosmos field .",
    "this set should be considered to represent `` random '' lines of sight through the cosmos fields , since there is nothing special about the location of the aperture centers . in contrast , the apertures in the second set are each centered on a bright ( @xmath26 ) galaxy found in the cosmos area .",
    "the bright - galaxy sample contains 1801 apertures . in figure",
    "[ fig_bgal ] , we plot ( 1 ) the cosmos `` random '' number counts , ( 2 ) the bright - galaxy number counts , and ( 3 ) the sum of the `` random '' number counts and the two - point correlation correction .",
    "the sum of the random number counts with the corrections from @xcite are in excellent agreement with the number counts in apertures centered on bright galaxies .",
    "[ fig_bgal ]    hence , _ on average _ , lines of sight to lens galaxies appear to be overdense only because of their local overdensities and not due to random structures along the lines of sight .",
    "once these local overdensities , and any obvious clusters along the line of sight , have been included in the lens models , the determination of global values of cosmological parameters by averaging over lens samples should be unbiased .",
    "of course , the averages can hide quite a large variation from lens system to lens system .",
    "[ fig_lens_intdiff ] shows the difference between the cumulative number counts of the lens sample and the cosmos mean cumulative counts for the 45  aperture . for the bright galaxies ( @xmath27 ) ,",
    "the lens fields with the largest overdensities are , in order starting with the most overdense , sdss  j1004 + 4112 , b1608 + 656 , and b2108 + 213 .",
    "if considering all galaxies with @xmath28 , the three most overdense fields are sdss  j1004 + 4112 , b1608 + 656 , and b0218 + 357 ( the three highest in fig .  [ fig_lens_vs_cosmos ] ) .",
    "all of these fields are outside the region enclosing 90% of the cosmos data .",
    "the overdensities for sdss  j1004 + 4112 and b2108 + 213 are not particularly surprising because each of these systems is known to be associated with a cluster or rich group @xcite . however , neither b1608 + 656 nor b0218 + 357 appear to be physically associated with such massive concentrations of galaxies .",
    "spectroscopic observations of the b1608 + 656 field have revealed multiple group - sized associations along the line of sight @xcite , but the b0218 + 357 field will have to be examined more closely in future analyses . because b0218 + 357 @xcite , sdss  j1004 + 4112 @xcite , and b1608 + 656 @xcite are systems for which time delays have been measured , these overdensities with respect to the mean line of sight must be included in any analysis to determine @xmath5 from these systems .",
    "[ fig_lens_intdiff ] also reveals fields that are underdense with respect to the mean .",
    "the most underdense in bright galaxies are sdss  1226@xmath290006 , j0816 + 5003 , and b0850 + 054 .",
    "although time delays have not yet been measured for any of these systems , similar care should be taken in future @xmath5 analyses that are based on the lens systems individually .",
    "inside 45  apertures ]",
    "to assess whether strong gravitational lenses are preferentially found along overdense lines of sight , we have devised a straightforward bayesian statistical number - count test which is conservative and robust .",
    "it requires only the number counts of galaxies as function of magnitude inside apertures of different sizes centered on the lenses and on control fields .",
    "we have applied this method to a sample 20 lenses with f814w acs images and control samples from the cosmos and pure - parallel programs .",
    "our hypothesis is that _ if _ gravitational lenses are found along highly overdense lines of sight compared to random pointings on the sky , either due to structure along the line of sight or overdensities associated with the lens galaxies themselves , _ then _ the number of galaxies within apertures centered on the lenses should show on average more galaxies than similar apertures in the control fields .",
    "this approach is conservative in that it does not require redshifts for the galaxies ( hence for a given magnitude , galaxies over a wide redshift range contribute to the number counts ) , but only that the ratio between mass and light integrated over the redshift cone is close to constant .",
    "thus , the number of galaxies can be used as a proxy for mass ; more galaxies on average implies more mass along the line of sight .",
    "more precise statistics can be constructed if the redshifts , galaxy types , etc .",
    "are known , and the galaxy masses are derived through scaling relations such as the tully - fisher relation @xcite or the fundamental plane @xcite .",
    "however , the results of such models quickly become model - dependent and prone to systematic errors . thus , although such approaches may show a more significant result than ours , a rejection of the hypothesis by our approach has the advantage of being a robust result that is less dependent on model assumptions .      1 .",
    "all distribution functions of number counts in the lens and control fields are well described by a combination of a gaussian random field for the sample variance ( i.e. , the underlying density field varies from field to field ) and poisson statistics in the number counts .",
    "this defines our underlying bayesian statistical model .",
    "2 .   in the three largest apertures , with radii of 45 , 381 and 225 ( steps of 2 in area ) ,",
    "we find _ no _ significant difference in the number counts between the lens and control fields ( fig .",
    "[ fig_delta_mu0 ] and table  [ tab_mu0 ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that this does not presuppose that there is no overdensity , just that our robust statistics do not require it .",
    "we do see a mildly significant overdensity in the @xmath30 bin in the 225 aperture , which might hint that indeed there are more bright galaxies near the lines of sight to lens galaxies .",
    "the smallest aperture ( 159 ) centered on the lenses , however , does show significantly more galaxies in the magnitude range @xmath31 than either the cosmos or pure parallel fields .",
    "this is not unexpected since massive lens galaxies live in overdense regions ( their two - point correlation is strong ) .",
    "4 .   when we correct for the effect of the two - point correlation , using the results from cosmos by @xcite , we find that a significant part of the differences between number counts in the lens and cosmos fields can be accounted for by the fact that massive lens galaxies live in _ locally _ overdense regions , as expected .",
    "the remaining differences lie within the @xmath32@xmath3 errors on the number counts , even though the lens fields still show slightly higher number counts in the range @xmath33 in the smallest aperture .",
    "these differences could either be due to small overdensities along the line of sight ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or due to a too simplistic correction of the number counts for the cosmos two - point correlation function .",
    "on average , the excess numbers of galaxies along the lines of sight to the lensing galaxies , integrated over the magnitude range that we have explored in this paper , are small ( e.g. , @xmath46 galaxies for the largest aperture that we examined ) . these excesses , which are mainly due to local overdensities associated with the lensing galaxy , amount to only @xmath948% of the total number counts in the three largest apertures .",
    "these fractional overdensities can be compared with similar numbers derived from numerical simulations .",
    "in particular , @xcite found , by ray tracing through the millennium simulation @xcite , that lenses do along biased lines of sight .",
    "the contribution of the additional mass , however , was only a few percent of the total surface mass density along those lines of sight , in good agreement with our results .",
    "while the average number counts in our sample of 20 strong lenses does agree well with the control samples , once the effect of local clustering has been taken out , individual lens systems can still have significantly discrepant number counts .",
    "thus , care should be taken when using an individual lens system to measure @xmath5 .",
    "based on our statistical test , we can say that : yes , lens galaxies live along overdense lines of sight compared to random pointings on the sky , but these overdensities can be nearly fully explained by the fact that these massive lens galaxies are formed in locally overdense regions .",
    "the contribution by everything else along the line of sight is , in our test , not significant on average .",
    "overall , we conclude that in strong - gravitational lens modeling one always needs to assess the effect of the _ local _ overdense field , but that the effect of the uncorrelated line - of - sight over- and underdensities should average out in large samples ( at least @xmath34 as in our case ) .",
    "as an example , we therefore expect the _ global _ value of @xmath5 from lensing to be little affected by line - of - sight effects , but it could become biased if the local overdensities of the fields in which the lenses are embedded are not accounted for in the modeling .",
