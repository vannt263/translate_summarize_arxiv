    "damped lyman-@xmath0 systems ( dlas ) currently provide the most complete means to study the gas - phase interstellar medium ( ism ) of high redshift galaxies .",
    "many hundreds of dlas have now been identified ( e.g. prochaska , herbert - fort & wolfe 2005 ) , with chemical abundances derived for @xmath8 150 from high resolution optical spectroscopy ( prochaska et al .",
    "such spectroscopy also permits studies of the gas velocity fields , although the interpretation can be complicated ( prochaska & wolfe 1997 ; haehnelt , steinmetz & rauch 1998 ; maller et al .",
    "few other physical quantities can be derived for dlas in a wholesale manner .",
    "although a handful of dlas have been subjected to detailed modelling of the ionization state of the ism ( e.g. prochaska et al .",
    "2002 ; lopez et al . 2002 ; tripp et al .",
    "2005 ) , have galactic counterparts identified ( mller et al .",
    "2004 and references therein ) or have size estimates ( lopez et al . 2005 , but see ellison et al .",
    "2007 ) , there are relatively few tools at our disposal to determine the physical characteristics of high redshift dla galaxies .",
    "one example of a technique that relies on well - understood physics and has been widely applied to the milky way and magellanic clouds ( e.g. tumlinson et al . 2002 ) , but is only recently realising its potential at high redshift , is the study of molecular hydrogen ( ge & bechtold 1997 ; ge , bechtold & kulkarni 2001 ; ledoux et al .",
    "2003 ; srianand et al 2005 ) .",
    "for example , in two dlas which exhibit molecular h@xmath9 absorption spanning a number of rotational levels , noterdaeme et al .",
    "( 2007a , b ) have been able to compute the properties of the radiation fields as well as gas phase temperatures and densities .",
    "another technique that can be used to probe the properties of absorption systems has been developed by wolfe , prochaska & gawiser ( 2003 ) who use detections of 2s  ( absorption from the excited fine - structure level of the ground state ) to infer the star formation rate ( sfr ) in dla galaxies .",
    "the downsides of these techniques are that they are both model - dependent and rely on the detection of uncommon species , so that they may present a somewhat biased view of the high redshift ism .",
    "for example , the molecular hydrogen fraction is greater than @xmath10 in only 4% of dlas and sub - dlas ( 19 @xmath11 log  @xmath11 20.3 ) when the metallicity is less than 1/20 of the solar value .",
    "this percentage rises to 35% for absorbers whose metallicity is greater than 1/20 of the solar value , indicating that molecule formation / survival is more successful in metal - rich , dustier systems ( noterdaeme et al .",
    "2s  is detected in about 60% of dlas",
    "( wolfe et al . 2008 ) .",
    "it has also been shown by wolfe et al . that the distribution of cooling rates ( which is directly determined from the column densities of  and 2s ) is bimodal .",
    "these authors argue that this bimodality is due to an underlying difference in the mode of star formation , analogous to the bimodality that leads to the blue and red sequences in galaxies at low redshift .",
    "the strength of ( and therefore ability to detect ) 2s  absorption [ for a given ] therefore depends on the properties of the galaxy .",
    "21 cm absorption studies of dlas towards radio - loud quasars provide an alternative probe of the state of the ism in high redshift galaxies ( see kanekar & briggs 2004 for a review ) , through measurements of the  spin temperature .",
    "the latter quantity is determined by combining measurements of the  column density ( determined , in dlas , from the lyman-@xmath0 absorption line ) and the  21 cm optical depth . in typical galactic clouds ,",
    "the spin temperature , t@xmath12 , of cold  clouds ( where collisions are sufficiently frequent to thermalise the  21 cm transition ) is approximately the same as the gas kinetic temperature ( e.g. kulkarni & heiles 1988 ) ; conversely , t@xmath12 is expected to be lower than the kinetic temperature for the warm phase of  ( e.g. liszt 2001 ) . for multi - phase lines of sight",
    ", the measured spin temperature can be shown to be the column - density - weighted harmonic mean of the spin temperatures of different phases ( and is thus biased towards the phase with the lowest temperature ) .",
    "for example , a sightline with 10% of its gas at 100 k and 90% of its gas at 8000 k ( typical temperatures of the cold and warm neutral media , cnm and wnm respectively ) would have a measured spin temperature t@xmath13 900 k.  21 cm absorption studies of dlas towards compact quasars thus provide information on the _ distribution of gas in different temperature phases _ and can be used to study the evolution of this temperature distribution with redshift ( e.g. wolfe & davis 1979 ; wolfe , briggs & jauncey 1981 ; de bruyn et al . 1996 ; carilli et al . 1996 ; lane et al .",
    "1998 ; chengalur & kanekar 2000 ; kanekar & chengalur 2001 ; kanekar & chengalur 2003 ) .",
    "dla spin temperatures may also yield other clues to the character of high redshift galaxies , beyond the direct probe of the gas temperature .",
    "for example , there is evidence that t@xmath12 is connected with galaxy size and morphology ( e.g. chengalur & kanekar 2000 ) . in the local universe ,",
    "large disk galaxies like the milky way and m31 tend to have significant cold gas fractions , yielding low harmonic mean spin temperatures , t@xmath14  k ( braun & walterbos 1992 ; braun 1997 ) .",
    "conversely , dwarf galaxies appear to have far larger fractions of the warm phase of with t@xmath15  k ( e.g. young & lo 1997 ) .",
    "kanekar & chengalur ( 2003 ) have argued that a similar connection between t@xmath12 and morphology exists in dlas , at least out to @xmath16 .",
    "if this relationship persists to higher redshifts , the spin temperature would be an excellent probe of galaxy morphology at redshifts where direct imaging of galaxies is extremely difficult .",
    "there is also tentative evidence for an anti - correlation between metallicity and spin temperature ( kanekar & briggs 2004 ; kanekar et al . in preparation ) , further suggesting that the gas temperature distribution in a typical dla may be determined by global factors like mass , sfr , metallicity , etc .",
    "finally , understanding whether the ism of typical dlas is dominated by the cnm or wnm has significant implications for modelling sfrs at high @xmath17 ( e.g. wolfe et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "although the measurement of dla spin temperatures holds great promise as a probe of the ism in high @xmath17 galaxies , there are a number of problems that need to be addressed .",
    "for example , although the cii@xmath18 model of wolfe et al .",
    "( 2003 ) requires about half of the high @xmath17 dla population to have sizeable fractions of cold , this is apparently contradicted by the high spin temperatures universally measured in @xmath19 dlas prior to our survey ( e.g. carilli et al .",
    "1996 ; kanekar & chengalur 2003 ; kanekar et al 2006 , 2007 ) . only at @xmath20",
    "have spin temperatures t@xmath21  k been obtained ( see table  3 of kanekar & chengalur 2003 ) .",
    "the reason behind the apparent dearth of low spin temperatures at high redshift has been the cause of considerable debate .",
    "one possibility is that the galaxy population at @xmath22 is dominated by dwarfs , whereas at low redshift , a more diverse mix of morphologies exists ( e.g. kanekar & chengalur 2001 ) .",
    "alternatively , it has been suggested that the high spin temperatures seen in high-@xmath17 dlas arise as an artefact of either low covering factors ( e.g. curran et al . 2005 ; curran & webb 2006 ) or differences between the optical and radio lines of sight ( wolfe et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "one of the problems in untangling the issues described above is the small number of  21 cm absorption studies at @xmath22 .",
    "after nearly thirty years of searches prior to the present survey , there have been only five detections of  21 cm absorption in @xmath23 dlas ( wolfe & davis 1979 ; wolfe et al .",
    "1981 ; wolfe et al . 1985",
    "; briggs , brinks & wolfe 1997 ; kanekar et al . 2006 , 2007 ) , with @xmath24  non - detections of absorption , yielding strong lower limits ( @xmath25  k ) on the spin temperature ( e.g. kanekar & chengalur 2003 ) .",
    "most of these results have been obtained in the last decade , as the result of improved frequency coverage on telescopes like the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) and the green bank telescope ( gbt ) .",
    "the primary reason for the lack of spin temperature measurements in high-@xmath17 dlas is simply the paucity of known dlas towards radio - loud qsos .",
    "for example , only two of the @xmath26 dlas detected in the sdss - dr3 sample of prochaska et al .",
    "( 2005 ) lie towards qsos with sufficient low - frequency flux density for follow - up 21 cm absorption studies .",
    "in addition , only two dla surveys have specifically targeted radio - loud quasars , the complete optical and radio absorption line system ( corals ) survey by ellison et al .",
    "( 2001 ) and the ucsd survey of jorgenson et al .",
    "( 2006 ) . however , both of these surveys selected quasars on the basis of their high - frequency ( @xmath27  ghz ) flux density . unfortunately , in many cases , the dla detections occurred towards quasars whose flux density at low frequencies ( corresponding to the redshifted  21 cm line ) is insufficient for absorption follow - up .",
    "a significant improvement of t@xmath12 statistics clearly requires a dedicated survey for dlas towards quasars selected at frequencies of 300  500 mhz .",
    "we have conducted precisely such an optical survey , specifically designed to detect dlas towards radio - loud quasars selected at low frequencies . in theory (",
    "i.e. excluding issues related to local radio frequency interference ) , it should be possible to follow up every dla detected in this survey with a search for redshifted  21 cm absorption . in this paper",
    ", we describe the optical portion of the survey , including the survey design and sample selection ( section [ sample_sec ] ) , observations and data reduction ( sections [ obs_sec ] and [ data_sec ] ) and the dla detections , fits and statistical properties ( section [ dla_sec ] ) .",
    "the survey has already yielded the first detection of a low spin temperature dla at @xmath28 ( york et al .",
    "2007 ) . a following paper ( kanekar et al . , in preparation ) will present the  21 cm observations and inferred spin temperatures for the full sample of dlas detected in the survey .",
    "our goal is to identify dlas from optical , ground - based spectra towards radio - loud quasars that will be suitable for follow - up spectroscopy in the redshifted  21 cm line . in order to proceed efficiently with this search",
    ", we must therefore first identify a sample of quasars that is well characterised at both optical and radio wavelengths .",
    "the quasars must obviously be radio - loud , but we must specifically be careful to select targets that have sufficient flux at 1420/(1+@xmath29 ) @xmath8 300  500 mhz to permit later searches for redshifted  21 cm absorption .",
    "we selected the texas radio survey ( douglas et al .",
    "1996 ) as the most suitable for our purpose , due to its low frequency and wide area sky coverage . in brief ,",
    "the texas ( txs ) survey was conducted with the texas interferometer at 365 mhz between 1974 and 1983 and contains almost 67,000 discrete sources with arcsecond positional precision .",
    "the survey covers declinations between @xmath3035.5 degrees to + 71.5 degrees and is complete to 0.4 jy and 80% complete to 0.25 jy ( douglas et al .",
    "1996 ) .    in order to select a sample of high redshift quasars from within the txs survey",
    ", we used the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) with the following search criteria :    * txs sources classified as qsos * redshifts @xmath31 * 365 mhz flux density @xmath32 mjy    this search yielded a total of 123 targets . from within this list , we excluded objects that we considered too faint at optical wavelengths for efficient follow - up ( typically @xmath33 ) and any targets which had already been included in previous dla searches . in order to fill the ranges in right ascension suitable for scheduled observing runs , we relaxed these criteria in a few cases to include additional objects .    observing time for this project was allocated at gemini - north , the william herschel telescope ( wht ) and the very large telescope ( vlt ) in observing semesters from early 2005 until late 2006 .",
    "the total telescope time allocated to this project amounted to 17.2 hours at the vlt , 32.2 hours on gemini - north ( of which 28 were completed ) and 5 nights at the wht ( see the next section and table [ tel_time ] ) .",
    "targets with @xmath34-band magnitudes brighter than 20.0 and declinations @xmath35 were typically observed with the wht .",
    "fainter targets at northerly declinations were assigned to gemini , whilst all targets with @xmath36 were observed with the vlt . with these allocations",
    ", we were able to complete observations of 45 qsos for our dla search .",
    "the final list of quasars in our survey is given in table [ optical_obs ] .",
    "observing procedures differed from telescope to telescope . at both gemini - north and the vlt ,",
    "observations were carried out in queue / service mode , according to the practices ( e.g. scheduling and calibration plans ) of those particular observatories .",
    "the wht observations were carried out in classic / visitor mode .",
    "we briefly describe the instrument configurations , run conditions and notable observing strategies for each telescope .",

    "we have presented the results of a survey for damped lyman-@xmath0 systems towards a sample of radio - selected qsos .",
    "the sample was designed to identify dlas that would be suitable for follow - up absorption spectroscopy in the redshifted  21 cm line .",
    "our sample consists of 45 qsos , covering a redshift path of @xmath37 = 38.79 , towards which we detect nine dlas and one sub - dla .",
