    "the process of star formation is currently not well understood .",
    "however , the main protostellar collapse phases of low - mass stars ( @xmath10.52m@xmath2 ) have been identified observationally and labelled as class 0 ( andr , ward - thompson & barsony 1993 ) , and class i ( lada & wilking 1984 ; lada 1987 ) protostars .",
    "these are believed to represent the phases during which the circumstellar envelope accretes onto the central protostar and disk ( e.g. andr 1994 ; ward - thompson 1996 ) .",
    "the final pre - main - sequence stages of classes ii & iii ( lada & wilking 1984 ; lada 1987 ) correspond to the classical t tauri ( ctt ) and weak - line t tauri ( wtt ) stages respectively ( andr & montmerle 1994 ) .",
    "these protostellar stages are beginning to be understood at least in outline ( for a review , see : andr , ward - thompson & barsony 2000 ) .",
    "protostellar infall has been reported in class 0 sources by a number of authors ( e.g. zhou et al . 1993 ; ward - thompson et al .",
    "however , the manner of the collapse remains a matter for debate .",
    "the ideas of static initial conditions for collapse ( e.g. shu 1977 ) have been disputed by many authors ( e.g. foster & chevalier 1993 ; whitworth et al .",
    "there is now a growing body of evidence which suggests that the collapse occurs from non - static initial conditions , and at a non - constant accretion rate which decreases with time ( e.g. kenyon & hartmann 1995 ; henriksen , andr & bontemps 1997 ; safier , mckee & stahler 1997 ; whitworth & ward - thompson 2001 ) .",
    "infall has even been detected in some starless cores , such as l1544 ( tafalla et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the densities and temperatures in the gas envelopes surrounding the youngest protostars are favourable for exciting a number of rotational molecular transitions , observable in the submillimetre waveband .",
    "the line profiles of these transitions contain information about both the physical state and dynamics of the envelope gas , and may potentially be used to test theoretical models of star formation , as many workers have shown ( e.g. bernes 1979 ; rybicki & hummer 1991 ; choi et al .",
    "1995 ; juvela 1997 ; park & hong 1998 ; hogerheijde & van der tak 2000 ) .    in this paper observations are presented of the protostellar candidates ngc1333iras2 and serpens smm4 , in transitions of hco@xmath3 , h@xmath4co@xmath3 , cs , co , @xmath4co and c@xmath5o",
    ". the hco@xmath3 and cs transitions preferentially trace high density gas , whereas co traces a much wider range of gas densities .",
    "the paper is laid out as follows : section 2 introduces the @xmath0-iteration method of numerical radiative transfer ; section 3 describes our approach to the modelling ; section 4 explores the sensitivity of the model to the various free parameters ; section 5 describes our observations and data reduction ; sections 6 & 7 present the results of our observations for ngc1333iras2 and serpens  smm4 respectively ; section 8 compares the observations with the model predictions and finds the best fits to the data ; section 9 presents a brief summary of our main findings .",
    "the non - expert reader may prefer to read the second half of the paper first , starting from section 5 .",
    "consider a cloud of gas with a specified distribution of density , kinetic temperature and composition , which may have internal turbulent and systematic motions .",
    "let any radiation sources not forming part of the cloud itself also be specified .",
    "for each molecular species , there exists a steady state solution for the distribution of rotational energy level populations as a function of position in the cloud . in the modelling of this paper",
    "we numerically calculate this distribution for the idealised case of a spherically symmetric model cloud , and predict the observed line profiles .",
    "this is a complex problem , due to the fact that well separated parts of the cloud can interact radiatively with each other .",
    "the @xmath0-iteration method , described below , is conceptually one of the simplest techniques for solving this kind of problem .",
    "( 80,90 )      the method is begun by choosing an initial radiation field in a more or less arbitrary manner . from this",
    "a ` false ' run of level populations may be calculated , by assuming the validity of the steady state rate equations .",
    "radiative transitions between these level populations will generally produce a radiation field which departs from the one originally assumed .",
    "if this radiation field is used to calculate a new set of level populations , and the procedure is repeated a sufficiently large number of times , the radiation field and level populations should eventually converge on a mutually consistent solution .",
    "@xmath0-iteration is a kind of diffusion process , where imbalances in the radiation field are smoothed out over a length - scale corresponding to approximately one optical depth at each iteration step .",
    "a number of radiative transfer models have been published ( e.g. rawlings et al .",
    "1992 ; zhou 1992 ; walker et al .",
    "however , the modelling in this paper was carried out using a modified version of the stenholm @xmath0-iteration code developed by stenholm and subsequently expanded by little and co - workers at the university of kent ( stenholm 1977 ; matthews 1986 ; heaton et al .",
    "the code uses the above method to solve the spectral line radiative transfer problem for the rotational transitions of linear molecules in a spherically symmetric model cloud .",
    "radial profiles of systematic velocity , temperature , density , tracer molecule abundance and micro - turbulent velocity dispersion may be specified .",
    "the model cloud is discretised using a number of spherical shells , and the level populations in each shell are determined in the iteration process from the calculated mean radiation intensity in the co - moving shell frame .",
    "once the level populations have converged , a calculation is made of a simulated spectral line observation on the cloud .",
    "this part of the code carries out straightforward numerical integrations of the equation of transfer along parallel lines of sight through the cloud to find the emergent intensities for a grid of impact parameters , which are then weighted according to a two - dimensional gaussian beam profile function .",
    "it is important to find a reliable test for the convergence of the model .",
    "one possible condition is that the maximum fractional change @xmath6 , of the level population @xmath7 between iterations @xmath8 and @xmath9 , is less than some specified value @xmath10 :    @xmath11    for all @xmath12 and j , where the subscripts specify the iteration numbers . in many cases ,",
    "the value of @xmath13 is a good estimate of the absolute fractional error in the corresponding level population , in which case convergence is ensured by setting a suitably low value of @xmath10 ( a value of @xmath14 or less is usually found to be sufficient ) .",
    "however , when the rate of convergence is particularly slow , this test may give a misleading result , since the fractional change between two successive iterations may then significantly underestimate the total change produced over a large number of subsequent iterations .",
    "the rate of decrease of @xmath15 should somehow be taken into account .",
    "dickel & auer ( 1994 ) use the following procedure to estimate the total fractional error @xmath16 of the level population @xmath7 after the @xmath9th iteration :    @xmath17 - 1}\\right|.\\ ] ]    the convergence criterion is then @xmath18 for all @xmath12 and j , for some specified @xmath10 much less than 1 . note that if @xmath19 then @xmath16 is much larger than @xmath20 ",
    "i.e. the total error is much larger than the fractional change between successive iterations .",
    "the rate of convergence is fastest when the optical depth of the cloud is small , or when the hydrogen number density is much greater than the critical thermalisation density .",
    "when the optical depth is small , radiation can travel across the whole cloud in one iteration , allowing the level populations in different parts of the cloud to adjust to each other quickly . when the density is close to , or above , the critical density for the principal thermally accessible transitions of the molecule , the level populations are determined mainly by molecular collisions , and are insensitive to changes in the radiation field .    for optically thick regions where the density is below the critical density",
    ", the convergence rate is generally much slower .",
    "the low density results in low collision rates , and the level populations therefore depend more sensitively on the radiation field , while the high optical depth means that the radiation field will take many iterations to adjust to the conditions in distant parts of the cloud .",
    "the code converges most rapidly near to lte and when optically thin .",
    "we have made several alterations to the code since it was made available to us .",
    "these have included changes to the internal structure of the code by , for example , improving the shell subdivision algorithm and incorporating rotation into the line profile calculation .",
    "however , the former did not affect the conclusions , it merely gave the code more resolution .",
    "some of the more significant changes made are now discussed in detail .",
    "an important modification made to the radiative transfer calculation was the removal of the approximation of core saturation used in the original code , known as the rybicki approximation ( rybicki 1972 ; stenholm 1977 ; rybicki 1984 ) , which may be summarised as follows : suppose that at some point in the cloud the following relation for the optical depth @xmath21 at frequency @xmath22 is satisfied for all directions * r*@xmath23 and solid angles @xmath24 :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the distance to the boundary of the model and @xmath27 is some prescribed constant .",
    "the intensity i in all directions at that point is defined in the rybicki approximation to be equal to the local source function s , i.e :    @xmath28    this equation is only applied for the particular values of @xmath22 for which @xmath29 . for increasing values of @xmath27 ,",
    "the volume of the cloud to which the approximation applies becomes smaller , and disappears altogether when @xmath27 increases beyond the maximum optical depth of the cloud .",
    "for the problems we consider , the source function can not be assumed to be uniform over distances corresponding to a few optical depths , and the rybicki approximation can not be used .",
    "we therefore do not use the rybicki approximation in the modelling in this paper .",
    "( 80,180 )      we have incorporated rotation into the code , in the form of ` solid body ' rotation ",
    "i.e. the angular velocity of all points in the cloud about some fixed axis is a constant , but systematic radial motions in the rotating frame are still allowed .",
    "the radiative transfer effects of solid body rotation were fully accounted for by changes to the section of the code which calculates the emergent line profile from the cloud , after the @xmath0-iteration solution has been found .",
    "no change needs to be made to the @xmath0-iteration code itself , since the solution for the level populations in the cloud does not change when solid body rotation is introduced , as is now explained .",
    "the radiation field in a frame co - moving with the gas at a given point in the model can only be affected by a superimposed velocity field if the latter introduces changes in the relative line of sight velocities of other parts of the cloud ( ignoring relativistic effects of order @xmath30 or less ) .",
    "solid body rotation does not introduce changes in relative line of sight velocities from one part of the cloud to another .",
    "for example , consider a non - rotating cloud which has systematic radial velocities @xmath31 and @xmath32 at the positions @xmath33 and @xmath34 respectively .",
    "writing @xmath35 for the distance separating the two points , the component of relative velocity , @xmath36 , along the line of sight between @xmath33 and @xmath34 is given by :    @xmath37/r_{12}. \\label{vlos1}\\ ] ]    now assume the cloud is made to rotate in solid - body fashion with angular velocity @xmath38 . let the new systematic velocities at positions @xmath33 and @xmath34 be @xmath39 and @xmath40 , where :    @xmath41    @xmath42    substituting into equation 5 , the terms in @xmath38 disappear , and the final expression is unchanged .",
    "this implies that the solid body rotation has no effect on the relative line of sight velocities between any two points in the cloud , and hence the radiation field in the co - moving frame at each point in the cloud is not affected by solid body rotation .",
    "this result only applies to the radiation emitted by the cloud itself .",
    "radiation entering the model from outside will be doppler shifted in the gas frame by the rotation , but the effect of this is completely negligible for realistic external radiation fields .",
    "however , solid body rotation does make a difference to the prediction for the observed line profile , since the rotation does introduce changes in the line of sight velocities of different parts of the cloud relative to an observer outside the cloud .",
    "if @xmath43 is the unit vector parallel to the line of sight from the observer to the cloud , and @xmath44 is the line of sight velocity ( relative to the observer ) of the gas at the position vector @xmath45 ( relative to the centre of the cloud ) , then :    @xmath46    where @xmath47 is the component along the line of sight of the radial component of the gas velocity at @xmath45 , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are , as before , spatial co - ordinates in the plane perpendicular to the line of sight at the distance of the cloud . @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the components of the angular velocity vector in this plane .",
    "the component of angular velocity parallel to the line of sight , @xmath52 , does not appear in equation 8 and has no effect on the observed spectrum from the cloud .",
    "analytical solutions of the equation of transfer are in general unobtainable for all but the simplest of problems . however , in the limit that the level populations are completely thermalised by collisions ",
    "i.e. in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte )  the spectral line calculations from the numerical model may be compared directly with analytical predictions .    in lte ,",
    "the excitation temperature for each transition approaches the kinetic temperature @xmath53 of the gas , and the source function for the transition j@xmath54 becomes @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "if @xmath56 is constant over the cloud , then the solution to the equation of transfer is :    @xmath57    where @xmath58 is the optical depth of the cloud at the frequency corresponding to the velocity bin @xmath59 . for simplicity",
    ", we consider the intensity emerging from a uniform density isothermal cloud layer of thickness @xmath60 , with no systematic motions , and with a constant velocity dispersion ( @xmath61 ) and total tracer molecule number density ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the optical depth through the cloud layer may then be written as :    @xmath63    @xmath64\\phi({\\rm v}_z)\\ ] ]    @xmath65\\phi({\\rm v}_z),\\ ] ]    where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are the number densities of tracer molecules in the upper and lower level of the transition , and other symbols take their usual meanings . in the last equation",
    "we have used the fact that in lte :    @xmath68    and also :    @xmath69    the explicit equation for @xmath70 is given by :    @xmath71    and the number density @xmath66 of tracer molecules in the level j may be evaluated by :    @xmath72    the sum in the denominator is the partition function , and usually converges rapidly after about ten or so terms ( depending on @xmath56 ) , and can be easily evaluated to the required accuracy .    substituting these expressions into equation  9 , with @xmath73 ,",
    "gives an expression for the predicted intensity as a function of @xmath59 . to compare these predictions with the stenholm code",
    ", we used a static model cloud with a uniform kinetic temperature , hydrogen number density , velocity dispersion , and abundance .",
    "the hydrogen number density was set several orders of magnitude above the critical density to enforce lte .",
    "figure  1 shows comparisons of the analytical and numerical predictions for the cs(j@xmath74 ) line , from lte models with progressively increasing cs abundance , covering a wide range of cloud optical depths .",
    "the excellent agreement between the predicted spectra in all parts of the line , and across the large range of optical depths , is a good indication that the integration of the equation of transfer along the line of sight is being carried out correctly .",
    "the lte comparison shown above , while instructive , does not test the ability of the code to carry out non - lte radiative transfer calculations reliably .",
    "we have not found any exact analytical solutions for non - lte radiative transfer problems in spherical geometry , to compare with the code in a similar manner as shown above . instead , we attempt to reproduce the line profiles obtained in a previous non - lte radiative transfer study ( krgel & chini 1994 , hereafter kc ) , which used a somewhat different numerical method .",
    "figure  2 shows a comparison of profiles taken from kc with the corresponding profiles calculated by our stenholm code .",
    "the figure caption gives details of the model cloud used , which has strong velocity and density gradients towards the centre , and is far from lte .",
    "both calculations use the cs collision rates of green & chapman ( 1978 ) .",
    "overall , the agreement between the two sets of line profiles is very good .",
    "the intensities of the line profiles predicted by stenholm are up to 10% weaker than the kc profiles , and the disagreement appears to be greatest for the smallest beam sizes .",
    "we checked our calculations , and found that this was not the result of inadequate sampling of the lines of sight used in the beam convolution , by re - calculating the profiles for a range of different beam sampling densities .",
    "the small disagreement in the line profile strengths is not serious , and may be caused by differences in the spatial , angular or frequency discretisation schemes used in the models , or small differences in the precise values of some of the parameters used .",
    "particularly encouraging is the very good agreement in the shapes of the corresponding line profiles .",
    "in this section we discuss our approach to the modelling of infall line profiles , and investigate the qualitative dependence of the predicted line profiles on a number of different model parameters .",
    "the approach to the modelling is necessarily a compromise between the desire to represent realistically the object being modelled , and the practical need to limit the parameter space and running time of the numerical simulations .",
    "the observations are modelled using the spherically symmetric micro - turbulent @xmath0-iteration radiative transfer code described above .",
    "even with the considerable simplification of spherical symmetry the number of model parameters is formidable .",
    "radial profiles of density , kinetic temperature , molecule abundance , systematic velocity , and micro - turbulent velocity width must be specified .",
    "additional parameters include the choice of inner and outer boundaries of the model , the incident radiation fields at the inner and outer boundaries , and the distance to the object .",
    "some assumptions must be made about the forms taken by these profiles , so that they may be described by specifying only a few parameters .",
    "some of the profiles are assumed to have a power law dependence with radius , which requires only the power law exponent and a normalisation factor to be specified .",
    "wherever possible , the choice of parametric forms used to describe the radial profiles is guided by theoretical considerations .",
    "we now discuss the profile of each physical parameter in turn .      following the onset of fully dynamical collapse",
    ", the radial velocity profile should tend towards a freefall profile ( e.g. larson 1969 ; shu 1977 ; hunter 1977 ; zhou 1992 ; foster & chevalier 1993 ) . the pure free - fall velocity profile may be written as :    @xmath75    the infall velocity profiles in non - rotating clouds which collapse from different initial conditions should approximately converge , even when the mass accretion rates are very different , as long as the comparison is made at times when the central protostellar masses are equal ( hunter 1977 ) .",
    "hence we use the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) model velocity profiles to parameterise the infall velocity field in the radiative transfer modelling , which allows the velocity field to be described in terms of only two quantities : the effective sound speed @xmath76 and the infall radius @xmath77 .",
    "we stress that these are merely used as parameters characterising the velocity field , and their actual physical significance is model dependent .",
    "we have found the following empirical fit to the exact velocity profile predicted by the standard sis model , for @xmath78 :    @xmath79    this equation fits the sis collapse field to within a few per cent .",
    "if the collapsing cloud has some initial rotation , then centrifugal support may become important at small radii , leading to a decrease in the radial velocity close to the centre of collapse . with an initial angular velocity @xmath80 , then the inner radius , @xmath81 , at which centrifugal forces begin to dominate depends on the mass already accreted , @xmath82 , and the radius @xmath83 enclosing this mass ( terebey , shu & cassen 1984 ) through the following relation :    @xmath84      as discussed above , the radiative transfer code used to model the data in this paper makes use of the micro - turbulent approximation .",
    "this assumes that random ` turbulent ' motions can be treated in the same way as thermal molecular motions , by incorporating them into the local line profile function .",
    "comparisons between radiative transfer codes which model macroscopic and microscopic turbulence suggest that the main effect of relaxing the micro - turbulent approximation is to reduce the strength of self - absorption features ( e.g. park & hong 1995 ) .",
    "although observations appear to indicate random motions of some kind must be present in protostellar envelopes , very little theoretical work has been done on the role of turbulence and turbulent support in protostellar collapse .",
    "lizano & shu ( 1989 ) derived a ` turbulent equation of state ' using the well known ` larson s laws ' ( larson 1981 ) , which relate the observed velocity dispersion ( @xmath85 ) , size ( r ) , and average density ( @xmath86 ) in molecular clouds and cores :    @xmath87    these correlations apply to ensembles of clouds and also to observations of individual clouds in different molecular tracers , and are associated with the turbulent motions in the clouds ( e.g. myers 1983 ) .",
    "combining the two relations above gives :    @xmath88    zhou ( 1992 ) used this relation to infer the variation of turbulent velocity with density in his radiative transfer calculations of infall line profiles .",
    "vzquez - semadeni , cant & lizano ( 1998 ) have recently argued that larson s laws may be inappropriate to dynamically collapsing clouds , because they were established from observations of clouds which were in equilibrium configurations .",
    "these authors carried out numerical hydrodynamic and magneto - hydrodynamic simulations to test the behaviour of the turbulence during the collapse , and found that , in contrast to equation  [ sigrho ] , the turbulent velocity dispersion actually increases with density during the collapse .    for purely hydrodynamic and weakly magnetic collapse models",
    "the relation between the turbulent velocity dispersion and the density was seen to approach a power law of the form @xmath89 ( i.e. @xmath90 ) . in the case of strongly magnetically inhibited collapse",
    ", the power law index was observed to change to @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) , consistent with the predicted behaviour for the slow compression of alfvn waves ( mckee & zweibel 1995 ) .",
    "the behaviour of the turbulence in infalling protostellar envelopes is thus theoretically rather uncertain .",
    "turbulence nevertheless plays a very important part in the formation of line profiles , and is one of the principal sources of uncertainty in the infall line profile modelling .      in a region where the infall velocity has a free - fall profile",
    "there is often a strong tendency for the density profile to adopt an @xmath93 distribution , since if the rate of injection of material into the accretion stream is not changing rapidly with time , the quantity @xmath94 should be approximately independent of radius .",
    "the prediction for the density profile deep inside the infalling region may be written as :    @xmath95    where , as before , @xmath96 is the infall radius , and @xmath76 is the effective sound speed .",
    "the exact model density profile inside the whole infalling region is very well approximated ( within @xmath11 per cent ) by the following empirical formula :    @xmath97 . \\label{shurho}\\ ] ]    outside the infall radius , the density profile is given by :    @xmath98    there are several competing theoretical models which predict different forms of the density profiles at various stages in the contraction and collapse of a dense cloud core ( e.g. foster & chevalier 1993 ; basu & mouschovias 1994 ; whitworth & ward - thompson 2001 ) .",
    "however , once a central protostar has formed there is a tendency in the theoretical models for the forms of the density and velocity profiles to converge towards the sis model forms , in particular towards the centre of the collapse ( e.g. foster & chevalier 1993 ) .",
    "we therefore initially search for fits to our observations using density profiles of the above form , although we do not require that the adopted density profile uses the same values for the parameters @xmath99 and @xmath76 as used in the velocity profile .",
    "the temperature of the gas in an infalling protostellar envelope is determined by the balance of heating and cooling processes .",
    "ceccarelli , hollenbach & tielens ( 1996 ) modelled these processes to derive the temperature profile in protostellar envelopes with central embedded heating sources .",
    "they found that in all the cases studied , the gas temperature profile stays within @xmath130% of the dust temperature , usually lying slightly below the dust temperature , @xmath100 . in the following it",
    "is assumed that the gas temperature is well coupled to the dust temperature , although this assumption may be significantly in error for hydrogen number densities below @xmath101@xmath102 .",
    "if the emitted radiation reaching the optically thin part of the envelope peaks at a wavelength @xmath103 , then the temperature of the dust at a radius @xmath104 will be given by :    @xmath105    the value of @xmath103 depends on the details of the dust radiative transfer through the optically thick inner region ( i.e. how the material in this region is distributed ) .",
    "kenyon et al .",
    "( 1993 ) used the diffusion approximation in the optically thick region to estimate the value of @xmath103 . for a density profile of the form",

    "1993 for further discussion ) .    for the objects modelled in this paper , the optically thick region",
    "is expected to be very much smaller than the beam size of the observations and is comparable to the inner shell radius used in the radiative transfer models . at sufficiently large radii",
    ", the gas temperature will approach the ambient temperature of the larger scale cloud .",
    "we therefore adopt the temperature profile appropriate to the optically thin limit ( @xmath111 where @xmath112 ) in the inner region , and switch to a flat profile at the radius where the power law inner profile falls below the ambient cloud temperature .",
    "( 80,40 )    ( 80,40 )      the profiles of cs and relative abundance in an infalling protostellar envelope are governed by time dependent chemistry and the transfer of molecules between the gas phase and the ice mantles surrounding dust grains .",
    "this problem has been studied by rawlings et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and willacy , rawlings & williams ( 1994 ) in the case of isothermal collapsing clouds .",
    "the objects studied in this paper contain internal stellar heating sources , and are unlikely to be well described by an isothermal model .",
    "the chemistry of internally heated infalling protostellar envelopes has been studied by ceccarelli , hollenbach & tielens ( 1996 ) .",
    "we refer the reader to all of these references for further discussion of the way in which chemistry can affect observed abundance profiles .    given these uncertainties and the requirement to limit the parameter space , we used flat abundance profiles in our modelling .",
    "the fractional abundances of cs and hco@xmath113 measured in dense molecular gas cores occupy similar ranges , typically between @xmath114 and @xmath115 ( e.g. irvine et al 1987 ; mcmullin , mundy & blake 1994 ; blake et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the measured values of [ @xmath116c/@xmath4c ] at the galacto - centric radius of the sun ( which applies to all of our observed objects ) lie in the range 50100 ( wilson & rood 1994 ) .",

    "if we choose an effective sound speed of @xmath119 , then an infall radius of @xmath1183700au is implied .",

    "the varying kinetic temperature in the envelope is not strictly consistent with the assumption of constant @xmath76 implied by the sis model , where @xmath127 .",
    "however , our primary concern is not to investigate the sis model solution in detail , but rather to investigate the essential features of line formation in infalling envelopes , whether the infall is described by the sis model or not .",
    "we set both the cs and relative abundances to @xmath128 , and assume a [ h@xmath116co@xmath3]/[h@xmath4co@xmath113 ] isotopic ratio of 60 .",
    "the set of molecular constants used in the radiative transfer modelling are listed in table  1 , where @xmath131 denotes the permanent molecular dipole moment and other symbols take their usual meanings .",
    "the data are taken from the jpl spectral line catalogue ( poynter & pickett 1985 ) .",
    "[ molecules ]    .assumed physical constants of the molecules modelled . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     as with ngc1333iras2 , the infall velocities in the model fit are much greater than would be predicted by the sis model given the density profile .",
    "from the infall velocity profile we estimate the mass of the central protostellar system to be @xmath132m@xmath117 .",
    "the temperature profile is normalised at a considerably higher level than in the iras2 fit , which would suggest that smm4 is considerably more luminous .",
    "( 60,190 )    a high accretion luminosity for this object is also suggested by the large central protostellar mass and mass accretion rate ( @xmath133m@xmath117yr@xmath124 ) .",
    "hurt & barsony ( 1996 ) estimated the luminosity of smm4 as 9l@xmath117 , after deconvolving the hires iras images of the serpens region to obtain the far - infrared fluxes .",
    "jennings et al .",
    "( 1987 ) estimated the luminosity of iras2 as 17l@xmath117 , also using iras fluxes , so there are clearly large uncertainties on these estimates .",
    "the parameters used in our model fits are inconsistent with these luminosities , and for our model to be correct , then either the smm4 luminosity calculated from the iras data , or our assumed protostellar radius , would have to be a significant underestimate .",
    "the predicted linewidths are considerably broader than the observations , as we found with ngc1333iras2 , although the peak intensities are in very good agreement .",
    "again , we suggest this may be indicating deviations of the infall velocity profile below the @xmath134 free - fall profile in the centre of the cloud .",
    "we found above that the smm4 envelope shows strong evidence for rotation ( @xmath135kms@xmath124pc@xmath124 ) , and suggested that the flattening seen in the spatial distribution of integrated hco@xmath136 emission may be caused by centrifugal support of the outer envelope .",
    "thus centrifugal braking may retard the infall velocity near the centre of the cloud .",
    "the calculated cs@xmath137 and cs@xmath138 line profiles match the observed line intensities reasonably well , but the peak velocities of the calculated profiles are less red - shifted than the observations .",
    "the enhanced blue - shifted wings seen in both of the observed cs spectra strongly suggest that outflow contributes to the emission in these lines .",
    "as discussed above , cs is believed to be enhanced relative to in bipolar outflows ( blake et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "figure  33 shows the fits to the off - centre hco@xmath136 line profiles towards smm4 from our best - fit model .",
    "we included a solid body rotation of 28kms@xmath124pc@xmath124 in the model ( assuming rotation axis in plane of sky ) , consistent with the above centroid velocity gradient across smm4 .",
    "as the hco@xmath136 spectra at the ( 0,0 ) and ( 0,+7 ) positions have approximately equal intensities , we assumed that the centre of the cloud lies at the offset ( 0,+3.5 ) .",
    "although the model profiles somewhat underestimate the observed lines , we are encouraged by the overall agreement of the trends in the observed lineshapes across the envelope .",
    "it is likely that a better fit to the line intensities requires a shallower density profile than predicted by the sis model .",
    "in contrast to iras2 we find little evidence for outflow emission in the off - centre line profiles , and essentially all of the high velocity emission can be accounted for by the infall .",
    "we consider these results to provide convincing evidence that both infall and rotation are taking place in the the serpens smm4 envelope .",
    "the magnitude of the rotational velocity is large enough for centrifugal effects to have a significant influence on the gas dynamics .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the physical constraints which can be used to limit the number and range of parameters needed to define the spherically symmetric models in the stenholm radiative transfer code .",
    "we have studied the dependence of the predicted line profiles on a number of model parameters .",
    "increasing the infall velocities in the envelope tends to produce stronger asymmetry between the blue and red - shifted peaks of double - peaked line profiles , without strongly affecting the separation between the peaks . _",
    "the value of the turbulent velocity dispersion is the most significant factor in determining the velocity separation between the peaks_. we carried out a preliminary investigation into the effect of adopting different power law dependences of the turbulent velocity width on the gas density and found the predicted line profiles to be extremely sensitive to the value of the power law exponent .",
    "we have studied the effect on the predicted line profiles of super - imposing a solid - body rotation onto the infall velocity field .",
    "the effect of the solid - body rotation on the on - source double - peaked line profiles was to ` smooth out ' the double - peaked structure .",
    "the centroid velocities and the line shapes of the off - centre profiles were found to be significantly altered by the solid - body rotation . on the red - shifted side of the rotational velocity gradient , a reversal of the asymmetry in the line profiles was seen .",
    "we measured the centroid velocity gradient predicted by our model for a solid - body rotating envelope , which was found to slightly underestimate the actual rotational velocity gradient used in the model .",
    "we selected the objects ngc1333iras2 and serpens  smm4 for detailed modelling using the stenholm radiative transfer code , confining our search to the sis model forms for the density and velocity profiles in the modelling , although we did not require these profiles to use the same sis model parameters in the models .",
    "our best model fits to both the ngc1333iras2 and serpens  smm4 data used velocity profiles which were more strongly developed than the sis model would predict , given the fit to the density profile .",
    "this is consistent with theoretical predictions that at the instant a central protostar is formed , the gas in the envelope has already accelerated to substantial velocities ( e.g. foster & chevalier 1993 ; jch ) , which contrasts with the static initial state assumed by the sis model , and is one of the principal distinguishing features between the sis model and other collapse models .",
    "our fits to the line profile observations of both objects slightly over - estimated the profile widths .",
    "we could produce better fits to these lines by lowering the infall velocity in the centre of the cloud , although this affected the fits to the main line profile slightly .",
    "the infall velocity may therefore be retarded from the @xmath134 free - fall relation towards the centre of the cloud , possibly by centrifugal braking .",
    "in the case of iras2 , the discrepancies between the model predictions and the observations for the off - source profiles could not possibly be accommodated within a plausible model of infall and rotation , and we attribute them to the outflow .",
    "the model fits to the off - centre hco@xmath136 line profiles of serpens smm4 included the solid - body rotation inferred from the hco@xmath136 centroid velocity gradient in the calculation . the predicted and observed profiles showed good agreement in the overall line shape although the model slightly underestimated the line intensities .",
    "we thus conclude that serpens smm4 is an infalling and rotating protostar .",

    "we would also like to thank les little for giving us a copy of the kent stenholm code .",
