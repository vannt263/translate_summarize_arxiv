    "pulsar radio emission and further propagation effects in the magnetosphere are not well understood .",
    "this situation is partly due to the difficulty in understanding particle acceleration and current flow in pulsars superstrong magnetic field . from the observation point of view curvature radiation",
    "seems to be most attractive among all the proposed radio emission mechanisms ( michel 1991 ; m@xmath1sz@xmath2ros 1992 ; xilouris et al . 1994 ) .",
    "however the coherent curvature emission by bunches has been often criticized ( e.g. melrose 1981 ) .",
    "curvature radiation is quite similar to synchrotron radiation , with the only difference that the role of larmor radius is played here by the radius of curvature of magnetic field lines .",
    "michel ( 1987a ) has indicated that curvature radiation has significant circular polarization when viewed at an angle to the plane of a magnetic field line , and reverses sense when viewed from the other side .",
    "the curvature radiation model has been developed by assuming that particles follow the curved field lines ( sturrock 1971 ; ruderman & sutherland 1975 ) .",
    "the theory of synchrotron radiation is developed by assuming uniform and straight field lines while the curvature radiation is developed by ignoring the spiral motion of the particles .",
    "the most often cited reason for ignoring spiral motion is that particles will instantly lose the energy associated with perpendicular component of motion by synchrotron radiation , cascading down to zero free energy .",
    "this is true near the polar cap where the field lines are straight .",
    "but when the particles move into the curved region of field lines they recover the perpendicular component of momentum as the field lines curve off from the direction of particle velocity . hence the radiation emitted by charged particles",
    "while moving along the curved magnetic field lines can not be described by considering either synchrotron or simple curvature radiation separately .",
    "gil & snakowski ( 1990 ) have attempted to examine the polarization properties of curvature radiation but they have also not considered the role of magnetic force .",
    "one of the most fascinating features of pulsar radiation is the occurrence of orthogonal polarization modes ( opm ) , i.e. , the two electromagnetic waves with orthogonal electric vectors .",
    "this phenomenon has become difficult to explain by emission models based on the simple curvature emission , as it can not specify the two preferred polarization angles .",
    "there are other models based on the propagation effects but one would expect such effects to be strongly dependent on frequency and require special viewing angles ( michel 1991 ) , whereas observations indicate the phenomenon is broad band .",
    "the interpretation based on the geometrical effects ( michel 1987b ) indicates that two modes could be due to the overlap of radiation from two distinct emission regions in the magnetosphere .",
    "however , it is not clear why the two separated sources have nearly orthogonal polarization .",
    "pulsars have been noted for their highly polarized radiation . to understand the phenomenology of pulsar polarization",
    ", many attempts have been made to fit the average polarization angle swing within the context of the rotating vector model ( rvm ) ( radhakrishnan & cooke 1969 ) .",
    "however many pulsars do not fit with this interpretation ( manchester 1971 ; rankin et  al .",
    "1974 ) and such discrepancies have been attributed to the occurrence of opm ( backer et  al .",
    "1976 ; gil & lyne 1995 ) . the relative strengths of opm vary with pulse longitude , thus causing discontinuities in the average pulse polarization angle swing ( cordes & hankins 1977 ) .",
    "the switching between opm mostly but not always occurs on the boundaries of micropulses and subpulses ( cordes & hankins 1977 ) , and may be intrinsic to the emission process ( manchester et  al . 1975 ; cordes et  al . 1978 ) .",
    "the single - pulse studies ( stinebring et  al .",
    "1984a , b ) show that opm overlap , and in the vicinity of pulse longitude where jump occurs some pulses prefer to have one polarization and some have other polarization .",
    "all these fine details are lost when the pulses are averaged .",
    "the depolarization in average pulse occurs due to the superposition of opm ( lyne et  al .",
    "1971 ; manchester et  al . 1975 ; stinebring et  al .",
    "1984a ) .",
    "cordes et  al .",
    "( 1978 ) have reported the existence of opm with opposite senses of circular polarization in pulsar psr  b2020 + 28 at 430 mhz .",
    "they found no evidence for a threshold intensity in the occurrence of opm .",
    "the peak subpulse emission can be in either opm , and sometimes transitions between modes do not occur on the edges of subpulses .",
    "therefore , the occurrence of opm may be stochastic and perhaps indicating the untenability of a geometric interpretation of the transitions as aspects of an angular beam of radiation .",
    "the motion of a charged particle along a rotating magnetic field line is discussed by gangadhara ( 1995 ; 1996a ) and in the case of a curved magnetic field line ( gangadhara 1996b ) , and the studies indicated that opm may be produced by positrons and electrons , as they have got opposite senses of gyration . in this paper , we show that the relativistic positrons and electrons can produce opm because while moving along a curved magnetic field line their accelerations become inclined with respect to the radius of curvature of a field line .",
    "we propose the coherent superposition of opm as a physical explanation for the polarization angle swings observed in micropulses and subpulses . in sect .  2 we discuss the forces acting on a positron and an electron while moving along a curved magnetic field line .",
    "the radiation fields due to a positron and an electron are derived in sect .",
    "the polarization properties of radiation fields are computed in sect .",
    "4 . finally , in sect .  5 ,",
    "we present a series of gray - plots describing the polarization states of opm from psr  b0950 + 08 , and discuss the possible explanation based on our model .",
    "in the physics of pulsar magnetosphere , a very important question is how are the charged particles ejected from the surface of a neutron star , and it has been discussed by many authors ( e.g. herring & nichols 1949 ; good & mller 1956 ; ruderman & sutherland 1975 ; kundt & schaaf 1993 ) . if particles are produced with the velocity having a component perpendicular to the magnetic field they quickly radiate away the energy associated with that component of motion by synchrotron radiation .",
    "hence the particle gyration becomes almost absent near the polar cap .",
    "once the particles radiate away the energy associated with the perpendicular component of velocity , they are free to move along the field lines as long as they are straight .",
    "but when the particles enter the curved region of field lines , they recover perpendicular component of velocity at the expense of parallel component ( gangadhara 1996b ) as the field line curves off from the direction of particle motion ( fig .  1 )",
    ". this phenomenon must be true for both primary as well as secondary particles .",

    "the motion of particles along curved field lines is discussed by jackson ( 1976 ) and gangadhara ( 1996b ) . the gyration motion ( spiral motion )",
    "is considered as the zero  order - motion , and the motion that arises due to the curvature of field lines as the first - order motion . in the absence of initial perpendicular component of velocity , particles can not gyrate around the curved magnetic field lines .",
    "the reason is that as particle attempts to spiral , field line curves off to the side and hence the centrifugal force prevents it from spiraling ( gangadhara 1995 ; 1996a ) .",
    "also , it is observationally known that no generalized faraday rotation is evident in pulsar magnetospheres ( cordes 1983 ; lyne & smith 1990 ) .",
    "there is _ no central force _ at o , and the magnetic force plays the role of centripetal force to keep the particle on track .",
    "but the peculiarity of magnetic force is that it acts in the directions perpendicular to the magnetic field and not always in the direction of radius of curvature .",

    "pacini & rees ( 1970 ) , and sturrock ( 1971 ) among others were quick to point out that the observed coherence may be due to bunching of particles in the emission region of magnetosphere .",

    "let us consider three observing positions : a at the left side of the pulse , b at the middle and c at the right side .    -1.0 truecm = 11.0 truecm    -1.0 truecm    -2.0 truecm    at the position a , observer mainly receives radiation from the left side of planes of magnetic field lines , and the circular polarization of opm tend show opposite senses ( see fig .",
    "an observer at position b ( fiducial plane ) views particle trajectory planes edge - on , therefore , the circular polarization of each mode undergoes sense reversal . finally , an observer at c receives radiation mainly from the right side of planes of magnetic field lines , and circular polarization of each mode becomes opposite to its value in position a. if the opm exist disjointly then the polarization angle of each mode swings in accordance with the rvm when the observers line  of  sight moves from point a to c.    radhakrishnan & rankin ( 1990 ) have identified the two extreme types of circular polarization signatures : an antisymmetric type ( fig .",
    "6d ) wherein the circular polarization changes sense at the middle of the pulse , and a symmetric type wherein it is predominantly of one sense .",
    "our model can easily explain the antisymmetric type of circular polarization , while for symmetric type we need further analysis on the high resolution data of individual pulses .",
    "the pulsar psr  b0950 + 08 was observed in 1994 april by using the 100m effelsberg radiotelescope . using a tunable hemt ",
    "receiver with a system temperature of @xmath197  k , observations were made at the center frequency of 1.71  ghz with a bandwidth of 40  mhz .",
    "the two circular polarizations are separated in the receiver and amplified .",
    "the signal is then fed into an adding polarimeter , a passive device with four output channels which allows further online signal processing .",
    "the pulse  smearing caused by the dispersion due to the interstellar medium is than removed using an online dedispersion device .",
    "this is a four unit @xmath198  khz filterbank .",
    "the output of each channel is then detected and converted into a digital signal by a fast a / d converter .",
    "after a time delay according to the dispersion measure , the outputs of all channels are added and than recorded by the backend . after a careful calibration procedure , stokes parameters are obtained from the four recorded output channels . a detailed system description and the calibration procedure are given by von  hoensbroech & xilouris ( 1997 ) .",
    "at frequency 1.71  ghz , we recorded about 1200 pulses with a time resolution of 0.24  ms .",
    "we consider only the main pulse as the interpulse is too weak to reproduce the properties of opm .",
    "the average polarization parameters are plotted as functions of pulse phase @xmath122 in fig .",
    "the continuous line curve indicates intensity @xmath199 variation while broken and doted ones indicate linear @xmath200 and circular @xmath201 polarization , respectively , in arbitrary units .",

    ".  10(b ) .",
    "the uniform or random component of polarization angle is probably due to the coherent superposition of opm ( see figs .",
    "this idea is also supported by the observation that the random component becomes significant only at those pulse longitudes where both modes exit .",
    "for example , see the polarization angle displays of psr  b0823 + 26 , b0950 + 08 ( stinebring et al .",

    "mckinnon and stinebring ( 1996 ) have also suggested that the random component may arise from superposed modes .",
    "barnard & arons ( 1986 ) have proposed @xmath213 frequency dependence for angular separation of opm , but our model do not predict any appreciable frequency dependence .    -3.0",
    "truecm = 10.0 truecm=9.0 truecm    0.5 truecm    on the basis of relative frequency of occurrence of opm at different pulse longitudes as indicated by figs .",
    "10(b ) , we may identify pulse longitude ranges i , ii and iii , as marked in fig .",
    "it is clear that both modes exist at all pulse longitudes but one mode dominates over the other at some longitudes .",
    "for example , in region ii the mode ( say mode  1 ) with @xmath214 dominates while in region iii the other mode ( mode  2 ) with @xmath215 dominates .",
    "-4.0 truecm = 21.0 truecm    0.0 truecm    when the frequency of occurrence of opm is very high as in region ii , it is likely that more often they simultaneously exist .",
    "if so then they get superposed either coherently or incoherently depending upon whether there is any phase relation between them or not .",
    "figure  10(d ) shows , at any pulse longitude , circular polarization can be of either sense depending upon from which side of particle trajectory the radiation is received ( see fig .",
    "4c ) . the distribution of different pulse intensities ( arbitrary units ) versus @xmath122 is shown in fig .",
    "10(e ) .    in revealing the properties of opm , figs .",
    "10(f)(h ) are much more expressive than figs .",
    "10(c)(d ) as the earlier ones directly display the distributions against the polarization angle @xmath205 figures  10(f ) and ( g ) indicate that if the modes exist disjointly , they appear at @xmath216 with high inear and circular polarization , but the random component is less polarized .",
    "figure  10(g ) shows opm tend have opposite circular polarization ( see fig .",
    "4c&d ) . figure 10(h ) shows the distribution of intensities of opm versus the polarization angle , and it indicates the mode  1 is stronger than the mode  2 .    from the theoretical point of view",
    ", it is very important to find the correlations between @xmath209 @xmath210 and @xmath217 using the individual pulse data , we computed the grey - plots ( fig .",
    "12 ) , which represent the correlations between different polarization parameters .",
    "figure 12(a ) shows _ linear polarization becomes maximum when the circular polarization is at minimum , _ a prediction of curvature radiation ( see figs .",

    "the behaviour of @xmath218 with respect to @xmath202 is shown in fig .",
    "it shows anticorrelation between @xmath202 and @xmath218 at higher intensities .",
    "the sharp cutoffs close to the vertical axis is due to the condition that @xmath202 is above @xmath203 level .",
    "manchester et  al .",
    "( 1975 ) and xilouris et  al .",

    "the behaviour of circular polarization with respect to the intensity is shown in fig .",
    "12(c ) . at higher intensities ,",
    "circular polarization is lower",
    ". the reason could be the superposition of opm with opposite senses of circular polarization .",
    "the motion of particles along the curved field lines can not be described in analogy with the motion of particles in a central force .",
    "the radiation emitted by positrons and electrons while moving along the curved magnetic field lines is probably orthogonally polarized .",
    "the radiation is highly polarized when the opm are not superposed .",
    "the polarization angle of each mode swings in accordance with the rvm .",
    "however , the polarization angle swings observed in micropulses and subpulses are often found to be contrary to the predictions of rvm .",
    "we expect such swings are produced when the opm are coherently superposed .",
    "our model do not predict any appreciable frequency dependence on the angular separation between opm . the circular polarization of opm tend to have opposite senses .",
    "the observations of psr  b0950 + 08 , particularly , polarization angle , linear and circular polarizations of opm are in agreement with our model .",
    "the polarization histograms clearly indicate that the depolarization is due to the superposition of opm .",
    "this effect becomes much more severe at higher frequencies as the coherence  length which is of the order of wavelength becomes small leading to an incoherent superposition of opm .",
