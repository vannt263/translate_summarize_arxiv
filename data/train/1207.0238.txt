    "our results suggest that at the transition , the properties of a typical cost - minimizing a matrix , as determined in @xcite , are similar to the properties of an average a matrix , as one would expect for a statistical model free of quenched disorder . in particular , the inverse - factorial law derived in @xcite for the typical minimum - cost matrix also describes the envelope of the rank - frequency distribution averaged over all such matrices .",
    "it has been suggested that the zipf - like distribution is associated with sub - optimal states , with costs slightly greater than the minimum @xcite .",
    "our simulations , however , do not yield a power - law distribution in this slightly sub - optimal situation , casting doubt on whether zipf s law can be explained in this manner",
    ". these authors also speculated _ `` that zipf s law ... could be the consequence of local minima of @xmath15 . ''",
    "_ our numerical simulations show that non - zipfian minimum - cost states are attained at the transition .    finally , it is interesting to speculate about which alterations of the model of ref .",
    "@xcite could lead to zipf s law .",
    "while models with substantial modifications have been investigated  @xcite , our finding of states compatible with zipf s law at @xmath2 suggests that small modifications of the model might be sufficient to break the degeneracy , such that a power - law distribution would correspond to the global minimum cost .",
    "one such possibility is the equal - cost criterion , shown in @xcite to be ( asymptotically ) a necessary condition for a zipf distribution .",
    "although we have shown that this condition is not sufficient , we also find that the average over all equal - cost matrices yields distributions that are closer to a power law .",
    "it appears unlikely , however , that this alone is sufficient to generate zipf s law .",
    "it is also worth considering the possibility that the evolution of language can not reach the minimum - cost states on historic time scales , and instead wanders in a space of sub - optimal configurations , for which zipf s principle does hold to good approximation .",
    "consider an integer - valued random variable @xmath199 with probability distribution @xmath200 $ ] , and let @xmath201 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath202, ...",
    ",@xmath203 , be a set of @xmath30 independent random variables drawn from this distribution , and let @xmath204 denote the @xmath7-th largest variable in this set .",
    "the event @xmath205 corresponds to having one or more of the @xmath206 equal to @xmath23 , and all others smaller .",
    "thus          for the poisson distribution with parameter unity , @xmath210 , the above sum converges quite rapidly , with the contribution due to terms with @xmath211 being negligible for the @xmath30 values considered here .",
    "figure 2 shows that the simulations of sec .",
    "iii are in good agreement with our analysis .",
    "the means of the second and third largest variables can be obtained using , @xmath212 = \\mbox{prob } [ x_n^{(1)}=m ]        + n \\left\\{(1\\!-\\!q_m)[q_m^{n-1 } - q_{m-1}^{n-1 } ] - p_m q_{m-1}^{n-1 } \\right\\}\\ ] ] and @xmath213 & = & \\mbox{prob } [ x_n^{(2)}\\!=\\!m ] \\nonumber \\\\        & + & \\ ! \\mbox{\\small $ \\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ }        \\left\\{(1\\!-\\!q_m)^2[q_m^{n-2 } - q_{m-1}^{n-2 } ] -p_m q_{m-1}^{n-2}[p_m+2(1\\!-\\!q_m ) ] \\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    analogous formulas can of course be derived for the fourth and subsequent variables , though they become increasingly more complicated .",
    "we have verified that the simulations agree with the exact expressions for the means of @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath214 .",
    "for example , for @xmath215 we have @xmath216 , @xmath217 , and @xmath218 for @xmath119 , @xmath219 , and @xmath220 , respectively , while simulation yields @xmath221 and @xmath222 , with the figures in parentheses denoting statistical uncertainties ."
