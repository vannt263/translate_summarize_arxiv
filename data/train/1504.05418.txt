    "tiling the plane or a given region has been of interest to mathematicians and artists as well , throughout the history of mankind . in a large number of problems ,",
    "the region to tile is often a polygon in the euclidean plane @xmath2 . without completeness , we list a few of these problems that have appeared in the literature .    in 1970 , monsky @xcite showed that a square can not be dissected into an odd number of triangles of equal areas . in a series of papers this problem , and result , was generalized for other figures and dimensions ( cf .",

    "the author is referred to @xcite .    in 1997 , g.horvth introduced the notion of _ irreducible _ dissections of a centrally symmetric polygon into centrally symmetric convex polygons .",
    "he gave an example showing that for a centrally symmetric hexagon , there are infinitely many combinatorial types of such dissections . on the other hand , he proved that , up to combinatorial equivalence , there are exactly six irreducible , _ edge - to - edge _ decompositions of this region .",
    "the aim of this paper is twofold . in the first part ,",
    "we show that , up to combinatorial equivalence , there are only finitely many irreducible , edge - to - edge decompositions of a centrally symmetric @xmath0-gon for every value of @xmath1 , and prove an upper bound on their number . in the second part",
