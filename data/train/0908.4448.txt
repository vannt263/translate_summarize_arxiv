    "computational electromagnetism is concerned with the numerical study of maxwell s equations .",
    "the yee scheme is known as finite difference time domain and is one of the most successful numerical methods , particularly in the area of microwave problems@xcite .",
    "it preserves important structural features of maxwell s equations@xcite .",
    "bossavit et al present the yee - like scheme and extend yee scheme to unstructured grids .",
    "this scheme combines the best attributes of the finite element method ( unstructured grids ) and yee scheme ( preserving geometric structure)@xcite .",
    "stern et al @xcite generalize the yee scheme to unstructured grids not just in space , but in 4-dimensional spacetime by discrete exterior calculus(dec)@xcite .",
    "this relaxes the need to take uniform time steps .    in this paper",
    ", we generalize the yee scheme to the discrete space manifold and the time .",
    "the spacetime manifold used here is split as a product of @xmath0d time and @xmath1d or @xmath2d space manifold .",
    "the space manifold can be approximated by triangular and tetrahedrons depending on dimension , and the time by segments .",
    "so the spacetime manifold is approximated by prism lattice , on which the discrete lorentz metric can be defined .",
    "* with the technique of discrete exterior calculus , the @xmath3 value discrete connection , curvature and bianchi identity are defined on prim lattice . with discrete variation of an inner product of discrete @xmath4forms and their dual forms , the discrete source equation and continuity equation",
    "are derived .",
    "* those equations compose the discrete maxwell s equations in vacuum case , which just need the local information of triangulated manifold such as length and area .    the discrete maxwell s equations here can be re - grouped into two sets of explicit iterative schemes for te and tm waves , respectively .",
    "those schemes can directly use acute triangular , rectangular , regular polygon and their combination , which has been implemented on c++ plateform to simulate the electromagnetic waves propagation and interference on manifold .",
    "maxwell s equations can be simply expressed once the language of exterior differential forms is used .",
    "the electric and magnetic fields are jointly described by a curvature @xmath5form @xmath6 in a 4-d spacetime manifold .",
    "the maxwell s equations reduce to the bianchi identity and the source equation @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the exterior differential operator , @xmath9 denotes the hodge star operator , and 1-form @xmath10 is called the electric current form satisfying the continuity equation @xmath11    as the exterior derivative is defined on any manifold , the differential form version of the bianchi identity makes sense for any 3d or 4d spacetime manifold , whereas the source equation is defined if the manifold is oriented and has a lorentz metric .",
