    "the possible existence of additional spatial dimensions has been a fascinating topic for theoretical physicists since the early ideas of kaluza and klein @xcite . the explanation why the additional dimensions have not been discovered so far",
    "can be given by the assumption that the additional dimensions are compactified to a very small radius .",
    "usually the length scale of the compactified dimensions is assumed to be of the order of the planck scale @xmath3  gev and therefore far away from the scope of experimental physics .",
    "however there is the possibility that the additional dimensions could be realized in a different way @xcite . in",
    "the add model @xcite the assumption is that the additional dimensions could be realized with a much larger compactification radius and much smaller fundamental scales , thus opening the possibility to observe deviations from the standard model ( sm ) at energies available at the lhc . according to the add model all matter fields of the sm live on the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional submanifold describing usual space - time and only gravity can propagate into the extra dimensions .",
    "this model yields an explanation why gravity appears to be so weak compared to the other interactions existing in nature ( thus circumventing the hierarchy problem ) .",
    "the add model goes hand in hand with the definition of a higher dimensional planck mass @xmath4 related to the four dimensional planck mass @xmath5 by the following equation    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the number of extra spatial dimensions and @xmath8 is their size .",
    "this effective reduction of the planck scale leads to interesting effects for the production of gravitons . while in usual perturbatively quantized gravity the effects of incorporating virtual gravitons can be neglected because they are suppressed by factors of @xmath9 the situation with the add model",
    "is different . by introducing additional dimensions according to the add model ,",
    "the production and exchange of gravitons can lead to observable effects @xcite .",
    "the most prominent prediction of the add model is probably the possible production of microscopical black holes in upcoming collider experiments @xcite . as exciting the production ( and subsequent evaporation ) of a black hole in the laboratory",
    "might be , as a non - perturbative process in quantum gravity it is difficult to make quantitative predictions for the measurement of such events .",
    "the sum of these difficulties makes most predictions which are derived from black hole production model dependent .",
    "it is therefore desirable to have complementary observables which allow to test a specific model in a more quantitative way .",
    "one possible approach that allows for a perturbative calculation is to consider the much larger number of possible couplings between the kaluza - klein towers in the perturbative gravitation sector of the add model and the sm .",
    "this results for instance in an enhanced gravitational radiation into the extra dimensions @xcite becoming more and more important at higher energies .",
    "it also leads to new contributions to sm physics due to virtual graviton exchange @xcite .",
    "such contributions are mostly undetectable because of the much larger sm background .",
    "ideally one is looking for sm processes that have a very clear experimental signal but a very low cross section .",
    "further , those processes should also have some tree - level contributions in the add model .    in this paper",
    "we suggest to look for the production of z - boson pairs , as it is done for a stabilized randall - sundrum scenario in @xcite . for the case of the add model in @xcite there is already considered production of a z - pair by graviton exchange for the lep and the tevatron on the one hand and the decay mode @xmath10 on the other hand . according to these considerations",
    "there are obtained constraints for @xmath4 below 1 tev .",
    "however , we show that zz - production at the lhc can lead to constraints for @xmath4 far above 1 tev .    in the sm the process of zz - production is suppressed due to the two electroweak couplings and due to the large zz - production threshold .",
    "another nice feature of this process at lowest order in the perturbative expansion is that the add contribution completely decouples from the sm cross section and can be treated separately .    in the following section we present the prerequisites for the effectively quantized gravity calculation in higher dimensions .",
    "after this we will consider zz - production in ( anti-)proton - proton collisions by graviton exchange at tree - level .",
    "we will see that at least in case of a d - dimensional planck mass @xmath4 in the  tev region the extra dimensional contribution to the sm cross section leads to a substantial deviation from the well known zz - production rate of the sm .",
    "let us shortly remind the reader on the effective field theory of gravity in extra dimensions given in @xcite . here , a small perturbation @xmath11 of the metric of flat minkowski space - time @xmath12 is considered .",
    "the complete metric @xmath13 is then given by    @xmath14    in the present case of additional dimensions the indices @xmath15 and @xmath16 run from 1 to @xmath17 . according to this a space - time point is described by a d - tupel @xmath18 .",
    "the einstein - hilbert action according to the einstein equations in d - dimensions reads    @xmath19    where @xmath20 describes the determinant of the metric . using the expansion ( [ entwicklung - metrik ] ) in ( [ einsteinhilbert ] ) leads to the following lagrangian    @xmath21    the @xmath7 additional dimensions",
    "are assumed to be compactified to a @xmath7-dimensional torus with radii @xmath8 meaning that the coordinates belonging to the additional dimensions are periodic with respect to the transformation @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the perturbation of the metric field can be expressed as    @xmath23    this leads to an effective lagrangian on the 3 + 1-dimensional submanifold of the following form    @xmath24    the occurring mass of the graviton corresponds to the excitations of the gravitational field in the compactified dimensions and is related to them according to the equation    @xmath25    by following the path integral quantization procedure one is lead to the expression for the graviton propagator .",
    "the effective mass of the graviton breaks the usual gauge invariance of gravitation    @xmath26    and thus the faddeev - popov procedure can be omitted .",
    "the graviton propagator is then    @xmath27    with polarization - tensor    @xmath28    by addition of the terms arising from the energy - momentum tensor of the matter and interaction fields @xcite the vertices are obtained . in the limit of a weak gravitational field",
    "only the matter and interaction fields of the sm fields ( assumed to live on the 3 + 1-dimensional submanifold ) contribute to the energy momentum tensor .",
    "it is therefore given by @xmath29",
    "in the perturbative approach we use the sm couplings @xmath30 and the ratio @xmath31 as smallness parameters , where @xmath32 stands for the mass scale in the process ( in our case essentially the z - boson ) .",
    "first , the collision processes of the partons , the quarks and gluons within the proton , have to be regarded .",
    "we restrict our analysis to processes at tree - level .",
    "the processes corresponding to the feynman diagrams displayed in figures ( [ f2 ] ) , ( [ f3 ] ) and ( [ f4 ] ) contribute to the cross section for the quark anti - quark process of the sm . in leading order",
    ", there is no contribution from the gluons in the sm .",
    "although sm calculations to higher orders in perturbation theory are feasible @xcite , they are neglected here , because one would also have to do higher orders in the add extension for consistency . however , as the add extension of the sm is non - renormalizable , those higher order calculations would not provide new insight or better accuracy .",
    "we will therefore limit ourselves to tree - level calculations , which are standard and will not be shown in detail here .",
    "as the parton distribution functions are defined in the high energy limit for massless quarks , we finally take quark masses to be zero .    concerning the contributions through graviton mediation",
    "all processes induced by a quark anti - quark pair can be neglected .",
    "the probability for the transition of a quark anti - quark pair to a zz - pair mediated by a single graviton @xmath33 is exactly zero and all other processes leading to such a transition and involving a graviton are of higher order .",
    "therefore , only the process where gluons annihilate and produce a graviton which couples to two z - bosons remains at this order of perturbative expansion .",
    "this process has different external particles than the sm process where only the quarks give a contribution to the double z - boson production rate .",
    "thus , the contribution by graviton exchange can be regarded separately . at tree - level , the s - matrix for the transition from a gluon pair to a zz - pair by mediation of a graviton corresponding to the feynman graph ( figure ( [ f1 ] ) ) is given by    @xmath34 \\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & \\cdot ( 2\\pi)^4\\delta^4(k_1+k_2-k)\\nonumber\\\\ & \\sum_n \\frac{ip_{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma}}{k^2-m_n^2 } ( 2\\pi)^4\\delta^4(k - l_1-l_2)\\nonumber\\\\ & \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{i}{\\bar m_p}\\left[w^{\\rho\\sigma\\gamma\\delta}+w^{\\sigma\\rho\\gamma\\delta}\\right ] \\right)\\nonumber\\\\ & \\frac{z_{1\\gamma}}{(2\\pi)^\\frac{3}{2}\\sqrt{l_{10 } } }   \\frac{z_{2\\delta}}{(2\\pi)^\\frac{3}{2}\\sqrt{l_{20}}}\\quad , \\label{s - matrix}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is defined as @xmath37 according to the expressions for the vertices found in @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath38 and @xmath39 denote the polarization vectors of the gluons and z - bosons respectively , where greek letters denote lorentz - indices and latin letters as indices refer to the internal colour - space of qcd .",
    "further @xmath40 and @xmath41 denote the initial momenta of the gluons and @xmath42 and @xmath43 denote the final momenta of the z - bosons .",

    "in general the differential cross section is related to the squared feynman amplitude @xmath59 by the following expression @xmath60 thus , the expression ( [ feynmanamplitude ] ) has to be squared .",
    "the summation over the polarization vectors of the z - bosons and the gluons can be performed by using the relations @xmath61 in order to obtain the total cross section one finally needs to integrate over the scattering angle @xmath62 .",
    "the infinite sum over kaluza - klein excitations @xmath63 is treated with dimensional regularization @xcite . by taking the lowest dimensional contribution ( @xmath64 and @xmath65 for @xmath66 ) and by choosing the regularization scale to be on the order of the new fundamental mass scale @xmath67 one finds @xmath68 other approximations for the sum over the kaluza klein excitations",
    "are given in @xcite .",
    "however , in our consideration we use equation ( [ eq_kksum ] ) . +",
    "this leads to the cross section @xmath69 with @xmath70 this is the inclusive cross section as a function of the number of extra dimensions @xmath7 and the planck mass @xmath4 in @xmath71 dimensions .",
    "to obtain the cross section for the ( anti-)proton - proton process one finally integrates over the parton distribution functions denoted by @xmath72 @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the parton ( whether this is a quark or a gluon depends on the index @xmath75 ) that is contributing to the process , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 . the parton distribution functions ( given in @xcite ) are evaluated at a scale of @xmath78 for the process corresponding to figure ( [ f1 ] ) and at a scale of @xmath79 for the processes corresponding to figure ( [ f2 ] ) , figure ( [ f3 ] ) and figure ( [ f4 ] ) .    in figure ( [ sig2 ] )",
    "the inclusive cross section at the fermilab energy of @xmath80  gev is depicted as a function of the fundamental mass scale @xmath4 , ( starting from the lowest bound allowed by the unitarity constraint @xcite ) .",
    "one sees that at @xmath81  gev graviton mediation according to the theory decribed above does not have any observable influence on the zz rate at fermilab @xcite .",
    "the same analysis is shown in figure ( [ sig14 ] ) for pp reaction at an energy of @xmath82  gev being available at lhc .",
    "here , the drastic difference between the sm di - z - boson rate and the graviton mediated di - z - boson rate might allow to observe effects of large extra dimensions even for a fundamental scale of @xmath83  gev .",
    "figure ( [ sig14 ] ) shows that at @xmath84=14000 gev , the add result dominates the sm prediction for small @xmath85 .",
    "this might reflect the fact , that the regularization method and the perturbative field theory approach loose validity in this regime .",
    "therefore , it is more reasonable to take the results depicted in figures ( [ sig2 ] ) and ( [ sig14 ] ) only close to the regime of its validity @xmath86 .",
    "this allows to state from which @xmath4 on experimental deviations from the sm zz rate at lhc @xcite should be expected . in figure ( [ mdschnitt ] )",
    "the testable parameter space is depicted for the lhc and tevatron experiments .",
    "dependence of the results differs decisively from the @xmath7 dependence obtained here ]    for experimental observation one would have to look for two high energetic and correlated lepton pairs in the final state as @xmath87 . by multiplying the total cross section with the branching ratio @xmath88",
    "this cross section can be estimated .",
    "the branching ratio can be obtained by taking the ratio of the couplings in the leptonic channels to the couplings in all fermionic channels ( the square appears because both z - bosons should convert to a di - lepton pair ) .",
    "@xmath89 where @xmath90 is the weinberg angle at the z - scale and @xmath91 .",
    "within the add model we have calculated the additional contribution to the double z - boson production cross section in @xmath92 reactions at high energies .",
    "the calculation is done to lowest order in @xmath30 and the ratio @xmath31 .",
    "it is found that the standard zz - production rate would be significantly enhanced compared to the sm rate , if the add scale would be lower than @xmath2  gev in case of the lhc , respectively @xmath93  gev in case of the tevatron .",
    "for the case of seven extra dimensions even @xmath94  gev could be tested at lhc .    in consideration of such results",
    "we want to remind the reader that the magnitude of the add contribution ( [ eq_addc ] ) directly depends on the chosen regularization scale @xmath95 in equation ( [ eq_kksum ] ) . but a choice of @xmath67 is natural and because of the fact that we only took the lowest dimensional term of the regularized graviton sum ( see @xcite ) .    therefore , if an enhancement above the sm zz - production rate would be observed at lhc energies , it can provide important insights into the possibly higher dimensional structure of space - time .",
