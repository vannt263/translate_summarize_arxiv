    "in the last decade several works appeared in the literature with the aim the explanation of the astronomical observations @xcite that the universe is presently expanding with a positive acceleration . the great number of the works admits the existence of a component of the universe  the so - called dark energy  which is the responsible for the present acceleration of the universe , but whose nature still remains unknown .",
    "the most natural candidate for dark energy was initially a cosmological constant ( see e.g. @xcite ) , but other models for dark energy were also proposed .",
    "the most common models , also called quintessence models , make use of scalar fields and barotropic equations of state where the ratio between the pressure and energy density assumes negative values ( e.g.  @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "other models consider that the dark energy field is described by exotic equations of state like the chaplygin fluid  @xcite or the van der waals fluid  @xcite .",
    "some cosmological models were also investigated in the literature by considering fermions as sources of the gravitational field @xcite .",
    "recently , the authors  @xcite proposed a cosmological model in a dissipative universe and showed that the fermions could be the responsible for accelerated regimes in the early universe by simulating an inflaton field and in the present epoch by simulating a dark energy field .",
    "another paper on this subject was published very recently @xcite .    in most of the works which investigate the role of the scalar field as source of the gravitational field it is common to consider it to be minimally coupled to the gravitational field .",
    "however , there exist some works in the literature @xcite where it was investigated the effects of non - minimally coupled scalar fields during the evolution of the universe .",
    "the aim of the present work is to describe a spatially flat , homogeneous and isotropic universe characterized by the robertson - walker metric and whose constituents are a dark energy field , a matter field and a field which represents the radiation and the neutrinos  from now on called radiation field .",
    "the dark energy field is modeled by a fermionic field which is non - minimally coupled with the gravitational field whereas the matter field represents the pressureless baryonic and dark matter fields .",
    "the radiation and matter fields are supposed to behave as non - interacting fields .",
    "the basic field equations for the evolution of the universe follow from dirac s equations and einstein s field equations which are solved numerically for given initial conditions .",
    "the red - shift behaviors of the deceleration parameter , of the density parameters of each constituent and of the luminosity distance , which result from the numerical solutions , are compared with the available data set in order to verify the viability of the proposed model .",
    "the manuscript is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "ii the dirac equations and einstein field equations are derived from the action of a non - minimally coupled fermionic field .",
    "the field equations for a flat , homogeneous and isotropic universe are given in sec .",
    "iii , which are rewritten in terms of the red - shift in sec .",
    "iv . in sec . v the cosmological solutions are obtained by solving numerically the system of field equations for given initial conditions .",
    "we close the work with sec .",
    "vi where we address to some remarks and sum up the results obtained .",
    "the metric signature used is @xmath0 and units have been chosen so that @xmath1 .",
    "we are interested in investigate a universe modeled by a mixture whose constituents are the fields of dark energy , matter and radiation . as was pointed out in the previous section , the dark energy is described by a fermionic field which is non - minimally coupled with the gravitational field , whereas the fields of matter and radiation are considered as non - interacting .",
    "the action for this model reads s = d^4 x , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the lagrangian densities of matter and radiation , respectively .",
    "furthermore , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the spinor field and its adjoint , respectively , and @xmath6 is the coupling constant between the spinor field and the curvature scalar @xmath7 .",
    "the spinor fields are treated here as classically commuting fields  @xcite .",

    "( [ 1 ] ) it follows the dirac equations for the spinor field and its adjoint coupled to the gravitational field , namely ^d_-dvd-2 r=0 , d_^+dvd+2 r= 0 .",
    "the variation of the action ( [ 1 ] ) with respect to the tetrad leads to einstein s field equations r_-g_r =- t_1- , where @xmath15 is the total energy - momentum tensor of the sources which is a sum of the energy - momentum tensor of the fields of fermions @xmath16 , matter @xmath17 and radiation @xmath18 , i.e. , @xmath19 .",
    "the symmetric form of the energy - momentum tensor of the fermions which follows from the variation of the action with respect to the tetrad reads @xmath20 -g^{\\mu\\nu}{\\cal l}_f\\ ] ] -(t^ -t^ _ g^ ) . above",

    "from now on we shall investigate cosmological solutions which can be obtained from the above proposed model when applied to a homogeneous , isotropic and spatially flat universe described by the robertson - walker metric @xmath23 , where @xmath24 denotes the cosmic scale factor .",
    "for the robertson - walker metric the components of the tetrad , spin connection and dirac - pauli matrices reduce to e_0^=_0^ , e_i^=_i^ , _",

    "moreover , in this case the spinor field is an exclusive function of time and the dirac equations ( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 6 ] ) become + 32h+^0dv d+r^0=0 , + 32h-^0-r^0=0 , where @xmath25 denotes the hubble parameter and the dot represents a differentiation with respect to time .",
    "for a homogeneous and isotropic universe the total energy - momentum tensor of the sources of the gravitational field is written as @xmath26 diag @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote the total energy density and pressure of the sources , respectively . in terms of the energy densities and pressures of the constituents , the total energy and pressure",

    "the above equation follows also from the bianchi identities applied to the einstein field equation ( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "note that due to the coupling between the fermionic and the gravitational fields , the right - hand side of ( [ 16 ] ) is not zero and represents the energy transfer between them .",
    "as it is well known , only two among the three equations given in ( [ 15 ] ) and ( [ 16 ] ) are linearly independent .    by assuming that the energy - momentum tensors of the constituents have the same form as the one for the total energy - momentum tensor , it follows from ( [ 8 ] ) and ( [ 9 ] ) that the energy density and pressure of the fermionic field read _",
    "f = v+3h , p_f = dvd2 + 2dv d - v+2r -(+2h ) .",
    "note that the existence of a coupling between the fermionic and the gravitational fields leads to a dependence of the energy density and pressure of the fermionic field with respect to the energy density and pressure of all constituents through the hubble parameter @xmath33 and the scalar curvature @xmath7 .    after the matter and radiation decoupling both fields behave as non - interacting fields so that the evolution equations for their energy densities read _",

    "its energy density and pressure reduce to _",

    "finally , a system of two coupled differential equations for the bilinear @xmath42 and for the hubble parameter @xmath33 is obtained from the dirac equations ( [ 12 ] ) , ( [ 13 ] ) and from the friedmann and acceleration equations ( [ 15 ] ) , that reads ( 1+z)h^-[2h-(1+z)h^]^-3h^=0 , 2h(1+z)(1-)h^=+p .    for",
    "the determination of the cosmological solutions from the above equations we have also to specify how the self - interaction potential between the fermions @xmath9 depend on the bilinear @xmath42 . here",

    "for the search of numerical solutions of the system of differential equations ( [ 26 ] ) and ( [ 27 ] ) together with ( [ 22 ] ) through ( [ 24 ] ) we have to specify initial conditions for @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 . here",
    "we shall suppose that in the radiation dominated era at @xmath49 ( say ) the value of the bilinear is very small @xmath50 with a smaller value for its derivative with respect to the red - shift @xmath51 so that the fermionic field rolls very smoothly during the evolution of the universe .",

    "still remains to fix values for the free parameters : ( a ) @xmath56 and @xmath45 of the self - interaction potential between the fermions and ( b ) the coupling constant between the fermionic field and the gravitational field @xmath6 .",
    "the following values @xmath57 and @xmath58 were found by imposing that the present value of the density parameter of the fermionic field matches the expected value @xmath59 when there is no coupling , i.e. , when @xmath60 .",
    "the search for values of these parameters by changing the initial conditions is exhaustible , specially due to the fact that the system of differential equations ( [ 26 ] ) and ( [ 27 ] ) is very unstable .",
    "here we shall adopt the above quoted values .",
    "cdm model and for the fermionic model with different values of @xmath6 .",
    "large frame @xmath61 , small frame @xmath62.,width=245 ]    in figure 1 the density parameters are plotted as functions of the red - shift in the range between @xmath61 ( large frame ) and in the range between @xmath63 ( small frame ) .",
    "we infer from the large frame of this figure that the coupling parameter @xmath6 has influence on the decay of the dark energy field and the corresponding increase of the matter field .",
    "moreover , the density parameter of the field of radiation in this range is very small . when @xmath60 there is no sensible difference between the @xmath64cdm model and the model where the fermions represent the dark energy field and there is no coupling .",
    "we note that by increasing the coupling parameter @xmath6 the decrease of the fermionic field and the corresponding increase of the matter field are less accentuated .",
    "this fact can be understood by noting that according to eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) a part of the energy density of the fermionic field is transferred to the gravitational field due to its coupling .",
    "furthermore , one can observe that the system of differential equations is very sensible to small changes of the coupling parameter .",
    "the density parameter of the fermionic field becomes negligible when @xmath65 for the case when there is no coupling ( @xmath60 ) and when @xmath66 for the other two cases @xmath67 and @xmath68 , with a more accentuated decay of the former with respect to the latter .",
    "the density parameters of the radiation and matter fields are represented in the small frame in figure 1 , which shows that the equality between the matter and radiation occur at @xmath69 .",
    "it is noteworthy that here we have taken into account the degrees of freedom of the relativistic neutrinos .",
    "cdm model and for the fermionic model with different values of @xmath6.,width=245 ]    the deceleration parameter @xmath70 is plotted in figure 2 as function of the red - shift .",
    "one can infer that the coupling parameter @xmath6 has also a very remarkable influence on the deceleration parameter @xmath71 .",
    "it is important to note that the @xmath64cdm model furnishes a different solution with respect to the uncoupled fermionic model ( @xmath60 ) . indeed , although the values of @xmath71 coincide at large values of the red - shift ( @xmath72 ) their present values at @xmath38 and red - shifts @xmath73 that correspond to the transition from a decelerated to an accelerated regime read : ( a ) @xmath64cdm model @xmath74 and @xmath75 and ( b ) uncoupled model @xmath76 and @xmath77 . the corresponding values for @xmath78 are : ( c ) @xmath74 and @xmath79 for @xmath67 and ( d ) @xmath80 and @xmath81 for @xmath82 . apart the last case all others fit more or less the experimental values for the deceleration parameter , namely , @xmath83 ( see @xcite ) and @xmath84 ( see @xcite ) .    in figure 3 it is plotted the difference between the apparent @xmath85 and the absolute magnitude @xmath86 of a source , denoted by @xmath87 and defined by _ 0=m - m=5\\{(1+z)_0^zdz h(z)}+25 , where the quantity between braces represents the luminosity distance in mpc . the circles in this figure correspond to the experimental data for super - novae of type ia taken from the recent work by riess et al .",
    "it is important to call attention to the fact that the values of the coupling constant @xmath6 chosen above do not lead to sensible differences in the values of @xmath87 so that only one curve for the fermionic model is represented in the figure .",
    "one can infer from the small frame of figure 3 that there is a very good agreement of the curves of the @xmath64cdm model and of the fermionic model with the experimental data for red - shifts in the range @xmath88 . from the large frame of this figure one",
    "observes that there exist some differences between the curves of the two models at higher red - shifts @xmath89 .",
    "as function of the red - shift @xmath40 for the @xmath64cdm model and for the fermionic model .",
    "large frame @xmath90 , small frame @xmath91.,width=245 ]",
    "in this work we have considered a classical fermionic field non - minimally coupled with the gravitational field .",
    "classical spinors were discussed by armendriz - picn and greene in ref . [ 6 ] and for more details one is referred to this work . here",
    "we point out that : ( i ) the expectation value of a spinorial field in a physical state is a complex number and not a grassmannian number and ( ii ) the spinorial field can be treated classically if its state is close to the vacuum .",
    "recently , exact cosmological solutions for a universe described by a robertson - walker metric and modeled by a neutral scalar field and neutrinos were obtained in the work  @xcite .",
    "the model of this work is different from the model presented here since in the former the neutrinos are considered as a majorana fermion field while the neutral scalar field represents the acceleron of the mass - varying neutrinos .    one important point which deserves attention is the one concerning the equivalence of the above description with the one in which the einstein s field equations is written as r_-g_r =- t _ , where @xmath92 , with @xmath93 -g^{\\mu\\nu}{\\cal l}_f\\ ] ] -(t^ -t^ _ g^)-(r_-g_r ) .    in this case",
    "we have @xmath94 thanks to the bianchi identities .",
    "if we write the total energy - momentum tensor as @xmath95 diag @xmath96  so that @xmath97 and @xmath98 represent the total energy density and the total pressure , respectively  it follows h^2=3,=-+3p6 , + 3h(+p)=0 , which are the usual form of the friedmann , acceleration and energy conservation equations , respectively .",
    "equations ( [ 32 ] ) are not in contradiction with the corresponding eqs .",
    "( [ 15 ] ) and ( [ 16 ] ) , since one can prove that the energy density and pressure of the latter case are related with those of former case by = ( 1- ) , p = p(1- ) .",
    "hence , it is straightforward to obtain eqs .",
    "( [ 15 ] ) and ( [ 16 ] ) from eqs .",
    "( [ 32 ] ) and ( [ 33 ] ) by the use of dirac s equations ( [ 12 ] ) and ( [ 13 ] ) .",
    "another remark is that the non - minimally coupling is important only at small red - shifts and its effect becomes negligible at high red - shifts where the matter - radiation decouples and the nucleosynthesis begins .",
    "moreover , the method adopted here was to solve the system of differential equations ( [ 26 ] ) and ( [ 27 ] ) by specifying small values for @xmath99 and @xmath100 at a high red - shift @xmath101 so that the fermionic field rolls very smoothly during the evolution of the universe .",
    "another method follows by combining equations ( [ 12 ] ) and ( [ 13 ] ) so that the resulting equation leads to = ( 1+z)^3(1+z_0)^3 . from the above equation",
    "one can obtain that the energy density of the fermionic field reads _",
    "now by specifying an initial condition to the bilinear @xmath46 one can made a similar analysis on the behavior of the density parameters , of the deceleration parameter and of the luminosity distance as was done in sec .",
    "v.    as a last remark we call attention to the fact that we have considered a very simple type self - interaction potential which depends only on the bilinear @xmath102 . with this choice",
    ", the fermionic field seems to behave as a bosonic field , but a comparison of the field equations and solutions of the present work with those obtained by binder and kremer in ref .",
    "@xcite for a bosonic field non - minimally coupled with the gravitational field shows that the solutions are quite different .",
    "a more general self - interaction potential should also depend on the pseudo - scalar invariant @xmath103 as the one investigated by the authors in ref .",
    "this work is in progress and shall appear in a forthcoming paper .",
    "to sum up : ( a ) the proposed model is very sensible concerning the choice of the initial conditions and the choice of the free parameters @xmath6 , @xmath104 and @xmath45 ; ( b ) the density parameter of the fermionic and matter fields decrease more slowly with respect to the red - shift when the fermions are coupled ( @xmath105 ) due to a more efficient energy transfer between the fermionic and the gravitational fields ; ( c ) by increasing the coupling constant @xmath6 the transition from a decelerated to an accelerated regime occurs at earlier red - shifts and ( d ) there is no significant difference in parameter @xmath87  which is related to the luminosity distance  for coupled and uncoupled fermionic fields .",
