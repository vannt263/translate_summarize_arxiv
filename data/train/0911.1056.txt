    "as is well known , in the very - high - energy ( vhe ) band above @xmath0 the horizon of the observable universe rapidly shrinks as the energy further increases .",
    "this comes about because photons from distant sources scatter off background photons permeating the universe , thereby disappearing into electron - positron pairs  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding cross section @xmath1 peaks where the vhe photon energy @xmath2 and the background photon energy @xmath3 are related by @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , for observations performed by imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts )  which probe the energy interval @xmath5  the resulting cosmic opacity is dominated by the interaction with ultraviolet / optical / infrared diffuse background photons ( frequency band @xmath6 , corresponding to the wavelength range @xmath7 ) , usually called extragalactic background light ( ebl ) , which is produced by galaxies during the whole history of the universe .",
    "neglecting evolutionary effects for simplicity , photon propagation is controlled by the photon mean free path @xmath8 for @xmath9 , and so the observed photon spectrum @xmath10 is related to the emitted one @xmath11 by @xmath12    within the energy range in question , @xmath8 decreases like a power law from the hubble radius @xmath13 around @xmath14 to @xmath15 around @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ a1 ] ) entails that the observed flux is _ exponentially _ suppressed both at high energy and at large distances , so that sufficiently far - away sources become hardly visible in the vhe range and their observed spectrum should anyway be _ much steeper _ than the emitted one .",
    "yet , observations have _ not _ detected the behaviour predicted by eq .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) . a first indication in this direction was reported by the h.e.s.s .",
    "collaboration in connection with the discovery of the two blazars h2356 - 309 ( @xmath17 ) and 1es1101 - 232 ( @xmath18 ) at @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "stronger evidence comes from the observation of blazar 3c279 ( @xmath20 ) at @xmath21 by the magic collaboration  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the signal from 3c279 collected by magic in the region @xmath22 gev has more or less the same statistical significance as the one in the range 220 gev @xmath23 600 gev ( @xmath24 in the former case , @xmath25 in the latter ) .    a suggested way out of this difficulty relies upon the modification of the standard synchro - self - compton ( ssc ) emission mechanism .",
    "one option invokes strong relativistic shocks  @xcite .",
    "another rests upon photon absorption inside the blazar  @xcite . while successful at substantially hardening the emission spectrum , these attempts fail to explain why _ only _ for the most distant blazars does such a drastic departure from the ssc emission spectrum show up .",
    "our proposal  usually referred to as the darma scenario  is quite different  @xcite .",
    "implicit in previous considerations is the hypothesis that photons propagate in the standard way throughout cosmological distances .",
    "we suppose instead that photons can oscillate into a new very light spin - zero particle ",
    "named axion - like parlicle ( alp )  and vice - versa in the presence of cosmic magnetic fields , whose existence has definitely been proved by auger observations  @xcite . once alps are produced close enough to the source , they travel _ unimpeded _ throughout the universe and can convert back to photons before reaching the earth .",
    "since alps do not undergo ebl absorption , the _ effective _ photon mean free path @xmath26 gets _ increased _ so that the observed photons cross a distance in excess of @xmath8 .",
    "correspondingly , eq . ( [ a1 ] ) becomes @xmath27 from which we see that even a _ slight _ increase of @xmath28 gives rise to a _ huge _ enhancement of the observed flux .",
    "it turns out that the darma mechanism makes @xmath28 shallower than @xmath8 although it remains a decreasing function of @xmath2 .",
    "so , the resulting observed spectrum is _ much harder _ than the one predicted by eq .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) , thereby ensuring agreement with observations even for a _ standard _ ssc emission spectrum . as a bonus",
    ", we get a natural explanation for the fact that only the most distant blazars would demand @xmath11 to substantially depart from the emission spectrum predicted by the ssc mechanism .",
    "our aim is to review the main features of our proposal as well as its application to blazar 3c279 .",
    "phenomenological as well as conceptual arguments lead to view the standard model of particle physics as the low - energy manifestation of some more fundamental and richer theory of all elementary - particle interactions including gravity . therefore , the lagrangian of the standard model is expected to be modified by small terms describing interactions among known and new particles .",
    "many extensions of the standard model which have attracted considerable interest over the last few years indeed predict the existence of alps .",
    "they are spin - zero light bosons defined by the low - energy effective lagrangian @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the electromagnetic field strength , @xmath31 is its dual , @xmath32 denotes the alp field whereas @xmath33 stands for the alp mass .",
    "according to the above view , it is assumed @xmath34 . on the other hand",
    ", it is supposed that @xmath35 .",
    "the standard axion  @xcite is the most well known example of alp .",
    "as far as _ generic _ alps are concerned , the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath33 are to be regarded as _",
    "so , what really characterizes alps is the trilinear @xmath37-@xmath37-@xmath32 vertex described by the last term in @xmath38 , whereby one alp couples to two photons . owing to this vertex",
    ", alps can be emitted by astronomical objects of various kinds , and the present situation can be summarized as follows .",
    "the negative result of the cast experiment designed to detect alps emitted by the sun yields the bound @xmath39 for @xmath40  @xcite . moreover , theoretical considerations concerning star cooling via alp emission provide the generic bound @xmath41 , which for @xmath42 gets replaced by the stronger one @xmath43 even if with a large uncertainty  @xcite . the same @xmath37-@xmath37-@xmath32 vertex produces an off - diagonal element in the mass matrix for the photon - alp system in the presence of an external magnetic field @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , the interaction eigenstates differ from the propagation eigenstates and photon - alp oscillations show up  @xcite .",
    "we imagine that a sizeable fraction of photons emitted by a blazar soon convert into alps .",
    "they propagate unaffected by the ebl and we suppose that before reaching the earth a substantial fraction of alps is back converted into photons .",
    "we further assume that this photon - alp oscillation process is triggered by cosmic magnetic fields ( cmfs ) , whose existence has been demonstrated very recently by auger observations  @xcite .",
    "owing to the notorious lack of information about their morphology , one usually supposes that cmfs have a domain - like structure  @xcite .",
    "that is , @xmath44 ought to be constant over a domain of size @xmath45 equal to its coherence length , with @xmath44 randomly changing its direction from one domain to another but keeping approximately the same strength . as explained elsewhere  @xcite , it looks plausible to assume the coherence length in the range @xmath46 .",
    "correspondingly , the inferred strength lies in the range @xmath47  @xcite .",
    "our ultimate goal consists in the evaluation of the probability @xmath48 that a photon remains a photon after propagation from the source to us when allowance is made for photon - alp oscillations as well as for photon absorption from the ebl . as a consequence , eq .",
    "( [ a1bis ] ) gets replaced by @xmath49 we proceed as follows .",
    "we first solve exactly the beam propagation equation arising from @xmath38 over a single domain , assuming that the ebl is described by the `` best - fit model '' of kneiske _ et al . _",
    "@xcite . starting with an unpolarized photon beam , we next propagate it by iterating the single - domain solution as many times as the number of domains crossed by the beam , taking each time a _ random _ value for the angle between @xmath44 and a fixed overall fiducial direction .",
    "we repeat such a procedure @xmath50 times and finally we average over all these realizations of the propagation process .    we find that about 13% of the photons arrive to the earth for @xmath51 , representing an enhancement by a factor of about 20 with respect to the expected flux without darma mechanism ( the comparison is made with the above `` best - fit model '' ) .",
    "the same calculation gives a fraction of 76% for @xmath52 ( to be compared to 67% without darma mechanism ) and a fraction of 3.4% for @xmath53 ( to be compared to 0.0045% without darma mechanism ) .",
    "the resulting spectrum is exhibited in fig .  1 .",
    "the solid line represents the prediction of the darma scenario for and and the gray band is the envelope of the results obtained by independently varying @xmath44 and @xmath45 within a factor of 10 about such values .",
    "these conclusions hold for @xmath54 and we have taken for definiteness @xmath55 but we have cheked that practically nothing changes for @xmath56 .",
    "our prediction can be tested in the near future by the satellite - borne glast detector as well as by the ground - based iacts h.e.s.s . ,",
