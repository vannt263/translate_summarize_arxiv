    "supersymmetry breaking communicated dominantly via the superconformal anomaly is a very interesting new approach to weak scale supersymmetry @xcite . in the absence of singlets , anomaly mediation provides a one - loop contribution to the gaugino masses , a one - loop contribution to the trilinear scalar couplings , and a two - loop contribution to the scalar ( mass)@xmath1 of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "these contributions can be understood as arising from a super - weyl invariant action once supersymmetry breaking is explicitly included in the superconformal compensator in supergravity , and are thus precisely proportional to the gravitino mass .",
    "if there are no direct couplings between the mssm sector and the supersymmetry breaking sector , then anomaly mediation provides the dominant contribution to all the mssm fields .",
    "this is a natural expectation if the mssm fields and the supersymmetry breaking sector fields are physically separated on different branes @xcite .",
    "there are several advantages to the anomaly mediation approach .",
    "the supersymmetric flavor problem is ameliorated , since the potentially dangerous contributions to off - diagonal squark ( mass)@xmath1 are suppressed .",
    "the form of the expressions for the masses induced via the superconformal anomaly are exact to all orders @xcite , and determined by infrared physics , namely the low energy @xmath0-functions",
    ". finally , the ratio of gaugino masses to scalar masses is order one ( i.e.  _ not _ one - loop suppressed ) .",
    "gauge mediation @xcite shares several features with anomaly mediation , namely the supersymmetric flavor problem is also ameliorated , and masses are induced at one - loop for gauginos and ( mass)@xmath1 are induced at two - loops for scalars . furthermore , gauge - mediated gaugino masses are ( at leading order ) proportional to the gauge ( coupling)@xmath1 , identical to anomaly mediation .",
    "the key phenomenological difference is that gauge - mediated soft masses depend on the content of the messenger sector , whereas anomaly - mediated soft masses depend on the low energy @xmath0-function coefficients .",
    "more generally , supersymmetry breaking masses are determined by ultraviolet physics in gauge mediation , and by infrared physics in pure problem . ] anomaly mediation . in general",
    "the phenomenology is expected to be quite different , but there is no a priori reason why these two fundamentally different origins of supersymmetry breaking masses could not be `` accidentally '' rather similar . we show that a simple choice of messenger matter using standard model ( sm ) representations gives the same numerical result for the size of gaugino masses at leading order . other messenger sectors that give similar results are also briefly mentioned . at next - to - leading order",
    "there are two - loop contributions to gaugino masses that do not respect the leading - order equivalence .",
    "however , there is still a restricted range of gauge - mediated parameters that give gaugino masses that are nearly equivalent to the next - to - leading order predictions of anomaly mediation .",
    "the scalar spectrum of a gauge - mediated model is well defined once the messenger sector is fixed .",
    "this suggests that a gauge - mediated model could be falsified simply by measuring several slepton and squark masses in addition to the gaugino masses , and then determining if the spectrum is self - consistent . on closer inspection",
    ", however , the situation is not quite so trivial .",
    "the first and second generation squark masses are nearly identical to the pure anomaly - mediated result in `` generalized messenger '' gauge - mediated models .",
    "( third generation squark masses are somewhat more distinct , but complicated by left - right mixing . ) furthermore , pure anomaly mediation predicts slepton ( mass)@xmath1 that are negative , requiring one of several proposed remedies @xcite .",
    "each `` solution '' to the negative slepton ( mass)@xmath1 problem must at least provide additional contributions to the slepton masses , and can have varying effects on the remainder of the mass mass spectrum . in this paper , we employ the simple phenomenological solution that merely adds a universal mass term to all of the scalar masses , leaving the gaugino masses unchanged @xcite . a more drastic alternative that , for example , shifts the gaugino masses from their anomaly - mediated values would be trivially distinct from the gauge - mediated models discussed here , and thus need not be considered further .",
    "there are at least two other general distinctions between gauge mediation and anomaly mediation : the wino nlsp is not stable in gauge mediation , and the sign of the gluino soft mass is opposite ( negative ) in anomaly mediation .",
    "the extent to which these distinctions are phenomenologically useful criteria is also discussed .",
    "our main purpose in this paper is not to advocate that the gauge - mediated wino nlsp models are more ( or less ) favored than an anomaly - mediated model with an appropriate negative slepton ( mass)@xmath1 solution .",
    "instead , we are interested in determining the ways to experimentally verify ( or falsify ) these scenarios .",
    "our starting point is that a gaugino mass spectrum that is approximately proportional to gauge @xmath0-functions is _ not _ sufficient to identify anomaly mediation as the source of supersymmetry breaking . instead",
    ", several other criteria must be used to separate the gauge - mediated models discussed here from anomaly mediation . in this way we attempt to gain a more robust understanding of the signals of both anomaly mediation and gauge mediation .",
    "in the following , we consider two complete different supersymmetric models , each with fundamentally different means by which supersymmetry breaking is communicated to the mssm .",
    "first , consider a model with no ( hidden sector ) singlets such that anomaly mediation ( am ) provides the dominant contribution to the gaugino masses . in this case , the expressions for the gaugino masses are @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the gravitino mass , ( @xmath6 ) always corresponds to the value of the gravitino mass in the anomaly mediation ( gauge mediation ) model .",

    "only effects to leading order ( i.e.  to one - loop for gaugino masses ) will be discussed .",
    "the scalar masses in this model are generated both by anomaly mediation as well as an unspecified source that provides an additional universal mass sufficient to cure the slepton mass problem .",

    "a sum over gauge couplings and yukawa couplings is implicit .",
    "trilinear scalar couplings are also generated at one - loop , and expressions can be found in @xcite .",
    "these expressions for the soft masses induced by anomaly mediation are in general quite different from minimal messenger gauge mediation models and ordinary supergravity models .",
    "there is , however , the apparent similarity that the anomaly mediation model generates gaugino masses at one - loop and scalar ( mass)@xmath1 at two - loops in a manner analogous to gauge mediation .",
    "in addition , the one - loop expression for the gaugino mass depends in both models on @xmath17 , although the coefficients are different and the supersymmetry breaking mass is distinct .    instead of restricting to messengers in complete gut representations @xcite ,",

    "( [ gm - gaugino - eq ] ) . both are characterized by a discrete quantity multiplied by @xmath17 multiplied by a supersymmetry breaking mass .",
    "it is precisely this similarity that we exploit in the following to construct a gauge mediation model with gaugino masses that are equivalent to anomaly mediation , using an appropriate relationship between the supersymmetry breaking masses .",
    "note that the gaugino mass and gauge coupling in eq .",
    "( [ am - gaugino - eq ] ) are evaluated at the weak scale , whereas the gaugino mass and gauge coupling in eq .",

    "require @xmath32 and that the supersymmetry breaking mass parameters coincide , @xmath33 .",
    "the predictions for the gaugino masses are identical to those of the anomaly mediation model , up to the sign of the gluino soft mass .",
    ", it is possible that the effective @xmath34 could be negative due to gauge messengers @xcite .",
    "however , this also causes the ( mass)@xmath1 for at least the first and second generation squarks to be negative , and therefore does not appear to be viable .",
    "] we emphasize that this is an accidental equivalence between two completely separate origins of supersymmetry breaking with @xmath35 .",
    "the equivalence does not apply to the sign of gluino soft mass , but this difference has only a limited phenomenological impact on the spectra .",
    "the sign does affect the gaugino soft mass predictions at next - to - leading ( two - loop ) order , and we discuss this in more detail in sec .",
    "[ higher - order - sec ] . in principle , measuring this sign would be an unambiguous way of distinguishing these models , but experimentally this is rather difficult , as we explain in sec .",
    "[ gluino - sign - sec ] . suffice to say there is no easily measurable difference between a model with a positive gluino soft mass , such as gauge mediation , and a model with a negative gluino soft mass , such as anomaly mediation .",
    "the ratio @xmath36 that sets the overall scale of the gauge - mediated soft masses could be different from @xmath5 while the gaugino masses remain equivalent . at first glance , only the proportionality ( @xmath37 : @xmath38 : @xmath34 ) @xmath39 ( @xmath40 : @xmath41 : @xmath42 ) is relevant .",
    "however , restricting to a set of messengers that preserves the perturbativity ( but not necessarily the equivalence ) of the gauge couplings up to the purported unification scale @xmath43  gev implies that @xmath36 can not be an integer multiple of @xmath5 ( other than unity ) .",
    "possible fractional values ( such as @xmath44 or @xmath45 ) could only occur with messengers in non - vectorlike multiplets , that can be justifiably ignored due to the difficulty of giving such fields a large supersymmetric mass . under these constraints , eq .",

    "these sets of multiplets are degenerate at leading order , but give slightly differing results at next - to - leading order ( e.g.  two - loop expressions for gaugino masses , and two - loop contributions to the gauge @xmath0-functions above the messenger scale ) .",
    "as as aside , we note that the third set of multiplets corresponds to one @xmath65 and two nearly complete @xmath66 s , but it is conspicuously missing the two pairs of @xmath67 s .",

    "( [ relate - eq ] ) , and in particular that only sm representations are needed , is one of the important results of this paper .",
    "another approach to constructing a gauge mediation model is to expand the messenger sector such that there are several singlets ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) with either different supersymmetric masses , or different @xmath23-terms , or both . this approach has the advantage that matter in complete su(5 ) representations is sufficient , thus naively preserving one - loop gauge - coupling unification .",
    "however , the supersymmetric mass scales or the @xmath23-terms ( or both ) must differ among the su(3 ) @xmath68 su(2 ) @xmath68 u(1 ) components fields , breaking the su(5 ) ansatz .",
    "there are two potential benefits of modifying the supersymmetric mass scale of su(3 ) @xmath68 su(2 ) @xmath68 u(1 ) component messenger fields .",
    "the first is a threshold effect , eq .",
    "( [ g - eq ] ) , whose size depends on @xmath69 .",
    "a given gaugino mass could be increased ( relative to @xmath70 large , with fixed @xmath23 ) by at most about @xmath71 , if @xmath72 is rather close to @xmath73 . in general",
    "it is hard to imagine how this could arise dynamically , although some ideas have been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( in an anomaly mediation context ) .",
    "the second potential benefit of shifting the supersymmetric mass scale of messengers exploits the running gauge coupling .",
    "the gaugino mass induced at the messenger scale is proportional to the gauge coupling squared evaluated at the messenger scale @xmath74 , and so it is possible to shift a given gaugino mass by a factor @xmath75 .",
    "this effect , however , is really a next - to - leading order correction . in practice ,",
    "only @xmath76 evolves significantly ( by at most about @xmath77 ) between the lowest and highest messenger scales ( between about @xmath78 to @xmath79 gev ) that are consistent with gauge mediation giving the dominant contribution to soft masses .",
    "one difficulty with both of these approaches is that several sm component fields of ( say ) complete su(5 ) reps are charged under more than one gauge group of the sm , so that modifying the scale of a given pair of messengers affects several gaugino masses simultaneously .",
    "we conclude that effects resulting from shifting the supersymmetric mass scale of messengers , by themselves , can not reproduce any of the large ratios @xmath80 or @xmath81 .",
    "if several singlets communicate supersymmetry breaking from the dynamical supersymmetry breaking ( dsb ) sector to the messengers , it is not implausible that they could couple differently to su(3 ) @xmath68 su(2 ) @xmath68 u(1 ) component messenger fields .",
    "then , given a small hierarchy of @xmath23-terms , is it trivial to construct a gauge - mediated model that has gaugino masses in a proportion indistinguishable from anomaly mediation .",
    "for example , take the components of a 10 + @xmath82 coupled to two sm singlets @xmath83 and @xmath84 using the messenger superpotential @xmath85 with @xmath86 , this model generates gaugino masses in exactly the same proportion as the one - loop @xmath0-function coefficients .- terms of different singlets could have opposite signs and be arranged such that the gaugino masses are in the same proportion as anomaly mediation including the sign of @xmath87 .",
    "however , we are not aware of any dsb or messenger model that could give this result . ]      the two classes of models discussed above , namely the generalized messenger models and the multi - singlet model , generate the same result for the gaugino masses , but give somewhat different results for the scalar ( mass)@xmath1 : @xmath88 \\ ; .     \\qquad \\mbox{(multi - singlet ) } \\label{ms - scalar - eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath89 factors are @xmath90 and @xmath91 respecting @xmath92 , and we have taken the mass scale of the messengers @xmath72 to be the same for both models .",
    "notice that each gauge group is weighted by @xmath93 in the generalized messenger models , whereas each gauge group is effectively weighted by @xmath94 in the multi - singlet model since each scalar ( mass)@xmath1 in the latter is proportional to @xmath95 .",
    "thus , holding the gaugino mass spectrum fixed , these two classes of models give different predictions for the scalar masses .",
    "for example , squark masses tend to be about @xmath96 lighter in the generalized messenger models .",
    "this illustrates that without specifying a particular messenger model , there is no unique prescription to translate a gaugino mass spectrum into a scalar mass spectrum .",
    "gauge coupling unification does not occur at @xmath97 gev for the generalized messenger models ; instead , @xmath98 is typically much larger than @xmath99 , which is somewhat larger than @xmath100 .",
    "we verified that @xmath98 remains perturbative near @xmath97 gev when calculated to two - loop order , as long as the messenger scale is larger than about @xmath101 gev .",
    "ordinarily the unification scale is defined by @xmath102 , which in the generalized messenger models occurs at an intermediate scale @xmath103 gev .",
    "conversely , gauge coupling unification can occur in the multi - singlet model as long as the shifts in the @xmath0-functions due to the additional messenger fields are nearly independent of the gauge group ( such as fields filling complete su(5 ) reps ) .",
    "a fascinating property of the generalized messenger models is that the predictions for the first and second generation squark masses are nearly identical to pure anomaly mediation .",
    "this is evident from eq .",
    "( [ gm - scalar - eq ] ) at the messenger scale , where the dominant contribution proportional to @xmath104 is the same as anomaly mediation .",
    "the prediction is also very well preserved under renormalization group ( rg ) evolution between the messenger scale and the weak scale , since the first and second generation scalar mass relations induced by gauge mediation are very close to the renormalization group invariant mass relations of anomaly mediation .",
    "this coincidence occurs precisely because @xmath34 is opposite in sign to @xmath105 .",
    "hence , this does not occur for slepton masses . due to this interesting property , we concentrate most of the remaining discussion of gauge - mediated wino nlsp models on the generalized messenger models .",
    "the mostly wino lightest neutralino is the nlsp and typically decays into a gravitino and a photon , although heavier nlsps can also have a significant branching fraction into a gravitino and a @xmath106 @xcite . depending on whether the fundamental supersymmetry breaking scale is smaller or larger than about a few hundred tev",
    ", the wino nlsp could decay either inside or outside a typical collider detector .",
    "if the decay nlsp @xmath107 gravitino @xmath108 photon were to occur well within a detector , it would be clearly evident with a hard photon emitted for every nlsp produced either directly or indirectly .",
    "this is a very robust signal in gauge mediation @xcite and completely different from anomaly mediation .",
    "however , if the decay length is significantly longer than a typical collider detector , the long - lived wino nlsp is indistinguishable from a stable wino lsp .",
    "we concentrate on this scenario for the remainder of the paper .    in supersymmetric models with a wino ( n)lsp",
    ", the mass splitting between the lightest chargino @xmath109 and the lightest neutralino @xmath110 is very small since both fields are nearly pure wino - like states .",
    "expressions for the mass splitting at tree - level @xcite and at one - loop @xcite have been calculated , with the intriguing possibility of a macroscopic @xmath111 decay length signal that has been studied in detail in refs .",
    "this is also an interesting signal of the gauge - mediated wino nlsp models discussed here .",
    "however , it is not a useful distinction between gauge mediation and anomaly mediation because the decay lengths of the respective wino ( n)lsps are comparable , as discussed below .    a complete set of parameters characterizing these models must also include @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "demanding the proper electroweak symmetry breaking vacuum with the correct value of @xmath114 determines @xmath115 as a function of the higgs soft masses and @xmath112 ( at tree - level ) , leaving only the sign of @xmath113 unknown . requiring that @xmath116 be greater than the current lep bound ( of about @xmath117 gev )",

    "[ tbeta - fig ] .",
    "= 5.0 in    above about @xmath118 tev the limit disappears because the lightest stau mass is always larger than the lep bound .",
    "there are three central phenomenological differences between anomaly mediation and gauge mediation : the scalar spectrum is in general different , the sign of the gluino soft mass is different , and the wino nlsp of gauge mediation is unstable .",
    "however , none of these differences are necessarily trivial to establish in a collider experiment , as discussed below .",
    "once the overall supersymmetry breaking scale @xmath36 is established , the scalar spectrum of the gauge - mediated models is fixed , up to a logarithmic sensitivity to the messenger scale . unlike anomaly mediation",
    ", there is no reason to suggest there should be additional contributions to the matter scalars ( not including the higgs scalars ) if gauge mediation via sm interactions provides the dominant source of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "indeed , the elegant resolution to the supersymmetric flavor problem via gauge mediation would , in general , be lost with additional contributions ( unless they were flavor - independent , aligned , or very heavy ) .",
    "thus , the simplest way to exclude the gauge - mediated models discussed here is to experimentally verify that the scalar mass spectrum does _ not _ follow the gauge - mediated scalar spectrum . for example , the charged selectron masses fall in a relatively narrow mass range relative to @xmath119 , ) . ] shown in fig .",

    "therefore , in an anomaly - mediated model with a universal additional scalar mass @xmath120 , the value of @xmath113 is fixed once the scale of the gaugino masses has been established .    in gauge mediation",
    "the higgs scalar masses are also determined once the messenger sector is fixed and the scale of the gaugino masses has been established .",
    "however , no dynamical origin for @xmath113 was given , and indeed it is possible that the higgs soft masses could be affected by the mechanism that ultimately determines @xmath113 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "for this reason , observables that depend on @xmath113 are not particularly reliable distinctions between anomaly mediation and gauge mediation , unless the gauge - mediated contributions to the higgs soft masses dominate over all other possible contributions .",
    "another interesting observable is the decay length of @xmath111 .",
    "this is also , unfortunately , not a useful distinction between anomaly mediation and gauge mediation for two reasons .",
    "first , the one - loop corrections dominate throughout the parameter space of interest , and to a very good accuracy depend only on kinematical functions of @xmath137 and @xmath138 @xcite .",
    "this contribution is therefore the same for a given wino mass .",
    "second , the smaller tree - level corrections @xcite depend sensitively on @xmath113 ( and @xmath112 ) , that we have argued is not a reliable distinction .",
    "thus , while the macroscopic decay length of the lightest chargino is an excellent signal of a wino ( n)lsp , it does not provide any useful information to distinguish the mediation of supersymmetry breaking .",
    "finally , at leading order trilinear scalar couplings , @xmath139 , are generated in anomaly mediation , but not in gauge mediation .",
    "they do reappear in gauge mediation after renormalization group evolution to the weak scale , but are usually smaller ( in absolute value ) than and opposite in sign to the anomaly - mediated values .",
    "these couplings affect the ( mass)@xmath1 matrix for the sfermions , but to a good approximation for moderate to large @xmath112 , they only significantly impact the stop mass matrix .",
    "this is because the off - diagonal term for up - type sfermions is @xmath140 whereas for down - type sfermions it is @xmath141 , which shows that the term proportional to @xmath113 is significantly diminished ( enhanced ) relative to @xmath139 for up - type ( down - type ) sfermions .",
    "thus , the splitting between the heavier stop ( @xmath142 ) and the lighter stop ( @xmath143 ) mass eigenstates is generally larger in anomaly mediation .",
    "taking a ratio , such as @xmath144 , also eliminates the dependence on @xmath120 in anomaly mediation , and therefore provides a useful additional distinction .",
    "note , however , that the gauge mediation prediction of nearly zero trilinear scalar couplings at the messenger scale relies on the assumption that the couplings between messenger fields and mssm matter fields are very small @xcite .",
    "four example models spectra are given in appendix  [ example - models - app ] to illustrate the comparison between two anomaly mediation models and two gauge mediation models .",
    "in general , the soft mass of the gluino in the mssm may be complex .",
    "after a field redefinition of the gluino , the phase of the gluino soft mass appears only in the interaction of a gluino and a chiral multiplet ( see appendix  [ gluino - app ] for details ) .",
    "furthermore , the phase cancels in processes that involve a vertex with a chiral multiplet _ and _ its hermitian conjugate .",
    "the phase reappears only in a chirality violating interaction ( such as an interaction with a higgs ) or a `` fermion number violating '' interaction .",

    "[ one - loop - fig ] might be useful .",
    "determining the best experimental observable depends on the precision to which particular sparticle properties are measured and the collider that is used .",
    "one apparently obvious distinction between anomaly mediation and gauge mediation is that the wino nlsp of a gauge - mediated model decays into a gravitino plus a photon .",
    "even if the decay length is significantly larger than the scale of a collider detector , a statistically significant excess of sparticle production events with one ( or two ) hard photon(s ) could experimentally establish that the wino is unstable ( otherwise , place a lower bound on its decay length ) . to confirm that the wino is unstable , in principle only a few events would be necessary , as long as sm backgrounds can be reduced to a negligible level . the probability that one nlsp decays within the distance @xmath52 ( @xmath201 ) of order the detector size , where @xmath202 , is @xmath203 .",

    "the other gaugino masses @xmath119 and @xmath87 receive at most a few percent correction to their lo values from the nlo pieces of the @xmath0-function , in both am and gm models . since one - loop threshold corrections are of the same order ( if not significantly larger , especially for @xmath87 ) , the nlo @xmath0-function corrections for these masses can be neglected .",
    "the large correction to @xmath137 in the anomaly - mediated approach naively suggests that accurately measuring the ratio @xmath212 would distinguish anomaly mediation from gauge mediation at next - to - leading order .",
    "however , it is not hard to imagine that messengers could generate the approximate proportion ( @xmath37 : @xmath38 : @xmath34 ) @xmath213 ( @xmath214 : @xmath215 : @xmath61 ) .",
    "perhaps the simplest possibility is to assume that @xmath69 for the @xmath216 multiplet is about @xmath217 , while all of the other multiplets have @xmath218 .",
    "this generates a rather large positive one - loop threshold correction of about the right size for @xmath137 only",
    ". the multi - singlet model with differing @xmath23-terms could also reproduce this ratio , but requires three different singlets coupling to the three sm components of the @xmath66 , with @xmath23-terms in the proportion ( @xmath219 : @xmath220 : @xmath221 ) @xmath213 ( @xmath63 , @xmath222 , @xmath223 ) .",
    "thus , the gauge - mediated wino nlsp models could approximately reproduce the nlo gaugino mass predictions of anomaly mediation , although one must make some slight modification to the messenger sector that is admittedly rather ad hoc .",
    "there exist gauge - mediated wino nlsp models that predict the gaugino masses , the first and second generation squark masses , and potentially the left - handed first and second generation slepton masses are nearly equivalent to the predictions of an anomaly - mediated model with a small universal additional scalar mass .",
    "the sbottom masses , stau masses , heavier higgs masses , and heavier chargino and neutralino masses are in general somewhat different due to a differing value of @xmath113 ( determined from ewsb constraints ) .",
    "but , we have argued that these observables are not useful distinctions between the two classes of models because the mechanism for the dynamical generation of @xmath113 in gauge mediation , which could affect the higgs soft masses , is unknown .",
    "this leaves only the ratios @xmath224 and @xmath144 as useful parameter - independent experimental criteria to distinguish between anomaly mediation and the gauge - mediated models discussed here .",
    "these scalar mass ratios remain useful distinguishing criteria even if the universality of the additional scalar mass @xmath120 is relaxed , but only if the left - handed and right - handed additional mass contribution is the same .",
    "the differing sign of the gluino soft mass is perhaps the clearest distinction between anomaly mediation and gauge mediation , and does not depend on the universality of @xmath120 .",
    "several one - loop processes are sensitive to this sign . probably the most promising way to determine",
    "the sign of the gluino soft mass is to accurately measure the @xmath177-@xmath2-@xmath3 coupling and compare it with the tree - level expectation . given an independent measurement of the sign of @xmath113 , this coupling is significantly enhanced ( diminished ) in anomaly - mediation ( gauge - mediation ) with @xmath188 , and vice versa for @xmath225",
    ". the precise size of the correction is strongly dependent on @xmath181 and @xmath173 , with a weaker dependence on other mssm quantities .",
    "the nlsp of any gauge - mediated model is unstable .",
