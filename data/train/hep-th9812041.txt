    "field theories in ( @xmath0)-dimensional space - time have been intensively studied not only as a laboratory for ( @xmath4)-dimensional field theory dynamics but also as effective theories at long distance in planar condensed matter physics @xcite . in particular ,",
    "some authors have investigated quantum electrodynamics in @xmath0 dimensions ( qed@xmath5 ) in connection with the effective field theories for high-@xmath6 super - conductivity @xcite.@xmath7 super - conductivity was originally proposed and studied in ref .",
    "@xcite in the context of the resonating valence bond state .",
    "the non - fermi liquid behavior in the normal phase of the high-@xmath6 system has been studied with the help of effective gauge theories and their renormalization group analysis .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for details . ] in this theory , there can be a topological , i.e. metric independent , gauge action , known as the chern - simons ( cs ) term , which connects a magnetic field @xmath8 with an electric charge density @xmath9 for the fermion field @xmath10 .",
    "because of this peculiar property , the cs term is essential in the field theoretical understanding of the fractional quantum hall effect , which is based on the composite excitation of an electron and magnetic fluxes @xcite .    a theory whose gauge field action includes both the cs term and the maxwell term was proposed by deser , jackiw , and templeton @xcite as an attempt to improve the infrared photon behavior in qed@xmath5 .",
    "in this theory ( chern - simons qed@xmath5 ) the coefficient @xmath11 for the cs term gives the photon a gauge invariant mass which explicitly violates parity .",
    "hosotani @xcite showed that spontaneous magnetization occurs in chern - simons qed@xmath5 , because the gauge invariant photon mass @xmath11 is completely screened out by parity - violating vacuum polarization effects .",
    "this also means that lorentz symmetry is broken through the induced magnetic field and the resultant massless photon plays the role of the nambu - goldstone ( ng ) mode . in this theory ,",
    "the gauss law , @xmath12 follows from the equation of motion .",
    "thus the magnetized vacuum corresponds to the ground state with finite fermion density , @xmath13 , that is , an occupied lowest landau level .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , the finite density vacuum configuration was set by hand as a state with a definite filling fraction @xmath14 that represents the degrees of occupation of fermions in the lowest landau level .",
    "the gauss law ( [ gauss ] ) tells us that spontaneous magnetization means a phase transition occurs between different vacua assigned to specific values of @xmath14 .",
    "however , without any parameter connecting differently occupied vacua , it was not clear whether the condensate @xmath15 , which supports the magnetic field , is spontaneously induced or finely tuned .    in order to clarify the above situation , an external source term @xmath16",
    "was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite to control the finite densities in the vacuum with a continuous parameter @xmath17 . from the viewpoint of statistical mechanics",
    ", @xmath17 plays the role of the chemical potential .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 has to exceed the fermion mass @xmath18 , or the energy of lowest landau level , in order to induce a finite fermion density .",
    "we notice , however , from the field theoretical viewpoint , the chemical potential term @xmath19 also plays the role of a term that explicitly breaks lorentz symmetry .",
    "so long as the fermion mass @xmath18 remains constant , we can not take the lorentz symmetric limit @xmath20 while retaining non - zero finite density in the vacuum .",
    "alternatively , however , if we take the symmetric limit such that @xmath21 , the finite density vacuum might be spontaneously realized through the condensate @xmath15 .",
    "in other words , the finite density vacua are _ spontaneously _ realized if and only if the fermion bare mass becomes zero @xcite .",
    "recently , in refs .  @xcite it was shown that a strong magnetic field enhances the condensate @xmath22 , or the dynamical generation of fermion mass , in ( @xmath0)-dimensional four - fermion interaction models",
    "@xcite explained this effect as the dimensional reduction of the phase space for charged particles coupled to a strong magnetic field.@xmath7 @xcite and was applied to the effective field theories in planar condensed matter systems @xcite . ] in a strong magnetic field , the wave function for charged fermions is localized within a region whose size is given by the magnetic length : @xmath23 .",
    "the fermion in @xmath0 dimensions , therefore , behaves like that in @xmath24 dimension , while the photon field is charge neutral and propagates freely in @xmath0 dimensional space - time even in the presence of the background magnetic field .",
    "the condensate @xmath22 is therefore easily formed much like in bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian of qed@xmath5 with @xmath25 flavor massless four - component fermions has u@xmath1 symmetry .",
    "when @xmath25 is smaller than its critical value @xmath26 , the flavor u@xmath1 symmetry is spontaneously broken by the condensate @xmath22 and the fermion acquires a dynamically generated mass @xcite . by means of the schwinger - dyson ( sd ) gap equation , shpagin @xcite showed that a fermion mass is dynamically generated and the u@xmath1 symmetry is spontaneously broken irrespective of @xmath25 in qed@xmath5 with an external magnetic field .",
    "this result means that the magnetic field catalyzes the fermion mass generation and seems contradictory to the results of refs .",

    "the effect of the explicit breaking parameters and the magnetic field @xmath8 are taken into account in the fermion propagator by using the proper time method @xcite .",
    "thus we can see the dependence of @xmath18 and @xmath17 upon the condensates , @xmath22 and @xmath27 , explicitly .",
    "it is found from the gauss law ( [ gauss ] ) that the consistency condition for nonzero magnetic field places a restriction on the cs coefficient @xmath11 in the symmetric limit @xmath29 , @xmath30 . in section [ sec : vacum ] we calculate the vacuum polarization tensor in the large @xmath25 limit in a gauge invariant manner .",
    "we regularize the parity - violating part , or the induced cs term , in a manner consistent with the charge condensation .",
    "the improved photon propagator including the effect of vacuum polarization is also derived . in section [ sec : sd ] we construct and solve the schwinger - dyson ( sd ) gap equation for the fermion self - energy that contains the dynamically induced fermion mass @xmath31 and chemical potential @xmath32 .",
    "we investigate the solutions to the sd equation in the symmetric limit @xmath29 , @xmath30 , to clarify whether or not the fermion mass and/or the magnetic field are dynamically generated .",

    "we have no other @xmath40 matrix which anti - commutes with all @xmath43 .",
    "we , therefore , have no chiral symmetry that would be broken by a mass term @xmath44 in two - component representation , but the discrete parity symmetry is broken by the same mass term . to construct a continuous group which resembles the chiral symmetry in @xmath4 dimensions ,",
    "it is necessary to enlarge the spinor representation to be the one with four - component spinors .",
    "now we have a clifford algebra given by three @xmath45 matrices , namely , @xmath46 we can then construct another two @xmath45 matrices @xmath47 which anti - commute with @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 . using @xmath51 and @xmath52 ,",
    "we can define a u@xmath53 group with generators @xmath54 we see that the lagrangian density for a massless four - component fermion is invariant under this global u@xmath53 symmetry .",
    "the appearance of mass term @xmath44 breaks the u@xmath53 symmetry to a subgroup @xmath55 whose generators are @xmath56 and @xmath57 . for the system of @xmath25 flavor four - component fermions , global symmetry is extended to u@xmath1 symmetry which is nothing but the direct product of the u@xmath53 symmetry and the flavor u@xmath58 symmetry .",
    "once again , the mass term @xmath44 breaks this u@xmath1 symmetry to its subgroup @xmath59 .    in @xmath0 dimensions ,",
    "the inversion of two space axes is equivalent to a @xmath60 rotation on the two - dimensional space so that parity transformation should be defined as an inversion of one spatial axis : @xmath61 .",
    "if we define the parity transformation of field operators , it should leave the lagrangian of massless qed@xmath5 remain invariant .",
    "a specific construction is to transform a two - component spinor and the gauge field as follows ; @xmath62 a significant feature of the two - component dirac spinor is the fact that mass term @xmath44 changes its sign under the parity transformation @xmath63 . as to the gauge field the cs term is odd under the above parity operation .",
    "it has been known that a two - component fermion induces a cs term with the same signature as the fermion mass through the one - loop vacuum polarization @xcite .",
    "a convenient method to construct the parity even mass term for fermions in @xmath0 dimensions is to use a four - component fermion in terms of two two - component fermions @xmath64 and @xmath65 : @xmath66 parity transformation for the four - component spinor @xmath10 is defined as @xmath67 it includes the exchange of upper and lower two - component spinors , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , in addition to the @xmath63 operation for each two - component spinor .",
    "therefore it is easy to write the parity - conserving mass term : @xmath70 that breaks the u@xmath1 symmetry to the @xmath59 , as well as the parity - violating mass term : @xmath71 that is a singlet of the u@xmath1 group .",
    "according to the theorem found by vafa and witten @xcite , it is energetically favorable that the u@xmath1 symmetry is broken to the vector - like global symmetry @xmath59 in the vector - like gauge theories such like qed@xmath5 . on the other hand",
    ", the theory of our interest contains the topological chern - simons term as well as the background magnetic field . since the theory ceases to be vector - like in general ,",
    "the stability of @xmath59 is not necessarily supported . in this paper",
    "we constrain ourselves to the case that the @xmath59 symmetry is unbroken , therefore the fermion mass is dynamically generated only as the parity - conserving mass term and the induced cs term due to the fermion mass is completely canceled .",
    "it is known that qed@xmath5 is a super - renormalizable theory and its @xmath72-function for a dimensionless coupling constant , which is defined as the photon propagation in the large @xmath25 limit , shows a nontrivial infrared fixed point @xcite . on the fixed point",
    "the gauge coupling @xmath73 scales like @xmath74 , which means that low energy effective theory is dominated by large @xmath25 contributions .",
    "in other words we should not neglect the screening due to vacuum polarization at long distance . in the following ,",
    "we construct the effective action in the large @xmath25 limit , which rules infrared dynamics of chern - simons qed@xmath5 .    according to ref .",
