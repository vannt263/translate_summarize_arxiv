    "we are interested in this paper in the nonlinear schrdinger equation in exterior domains @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a non - trapping obstacle with smooth boundary with dirichlet boundary condition @xmath2 the class of solutions to is invariant by the scaling @xmath3 this scaling defines a notion of criticality , specifically , for a given banach space of initial data @xmath4 , the problem is called critical if the norm is invariant under",
    ". the problem is called subcritical if the norm of the rescaled solution diverges as @xmath5 ; if the norm shrinks to zero , then the problem is supercritical . moreover , considering the initial value problem for @xmath6 , the problem is critical when @xmath7 , subcritical when @xmath8 , and supercritical when @xmath9.now , denote by @xmath10 the mass and the energy which are conserved .    for the case of 3d exterior domains , planchon and vega obtained in @xcite an @xmath11 strichartz estimate and",
    "they used it along with local smoothing estimates near the boundary to prove the local well - posedness of the family of nonlinear equations for @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and that the solution is global for the defocusing case ( + sign in ) .",
    "they also proved scattering for the cubic defocusing nonlinear equation outside star - shaped obstacles for initial data in @xmath14 .",
    "for the energy critical case @xmath15 , ivanovici proved in @xcite local well - posedness for solutions with initial data in @xmath16 and global well - posedness for small data , outside strictly convex obstacles using the melrose - taylor parametrix .",
    "scattering results were also obtained for all subquintic defocusing nonlinearities .",
    "ivanovici and planchon then extended in @xcite the local well posedness ( and global for small energy data ) to the quintic nonlinear schrdinger equation for any non - trapping domain in @xmath17 using the smoothing effect in @xmath18 for the linear equation .",
    "their local result also holds for the neumann boundary condition .",
    "they also extended the scattering of solutions to the defocusing nonlinear equation outside star - shaped obstacles with initial data in @xmath14 for @xmath19 .",
    "a very recent result was obtained by killip , visan , and zhang in @xcite for the quintic defocusing nls in the exterior of strictly convex 3d obstacles with the dirichlet boundary condition , where they proved global well - posedness and scattering for all initial data in the energy space .",
    "our main interest here is exterior domains in 2 dimensions which is known to be the most difficult one regarding scattering questions even in the case of the full space @xmath20 .",
    "in fact , after the results of ginibre and velo @xcite for @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) for the @xmath16 subcritical case that corresponds to the case @xmath22 , the obstruction of the dimension was removed by nakanishi @xcite ( in dimensions 1 and 2 , all powers @xmath23 have an @xmath24 that is less than 1 ) , but his techniques are not well suited for the domains case .",
    "however , a fundamental contribution to the existence and scattering theory in the whole space and that turned out later @xcite to be suitable for the case of exterior domains , was by colliander , keel , staffilani , takaoka , and tao ( @xcite , @xcite ) through introducing the morawetz interactive inequalities .",
    "similar problem with low dimensions appears due to the sign of the bilaplacian term that comes from the use of a convex weight which is the euclidean distance .",
    "the sign turns out to be wrong for dimensions less than 3 .",
    "this obstruction was then overcome simultaneously and independently by colliander , grillakis , and tzirakis in @xcite as well as by planchon and vega in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite the authors also used the bilinear multiplier technique to obtain their results for exterior domains in 3d .",
    "again , just like in the whole space , the obstruction of the dimension appears as a result of the sign of the bilaplacian .",
    "that is why the local smoothing ( prop .",
    "2.7 in @xcite ) , which is a key ingredient in the proof of existence and scattering , was given in dimension 3 and higher .",
    "however , planchon and vega recently removed this restriction in @xcite and they obtained global existence and scattering results in 2d domains exterior to star - shaped obstacles to the nonlinear defocusing problem with initial data in @xmath14 and for @xmath25 .",
    "the main idea in @xcite was using the tensor product technique ( as developed e.g. in @xcite to obtain a quadrilinear morawetz interaction estimate in @xmath26 ) by constructing @xmath27 solution of the nonlinear schrdinger in @xmath28 , and then using the local smoothing inequality obtained from morawetz s multipliers in dimension @xmath29 thus resolving the issue of the wrong sign of the bilaplacian in dimension 2 . their local smoothing estimate is a key step to get that @xmath30 is in @xmath31 for both the nonlinear and linear solutions which leads to obtain the global in time strichartz estimate @xmath32 ( for the case of star - shaped obstacles ) which is the key factor to get their result .    in this paper",
    "we extend the result of planchon and vega in two directions , the range of nonlinearities and the class of obstacles under consideration .",
    "first , we extend the local existence for @xmath33 and for any non - trapping obstacle by using the following set of strichartz estimates obtained by blair , smith , and sogge in @xcite :    [ bsstheorem](theorem 1.1 , @xcite ) let @xmath34 be the exterior domain to a compact non - trapping obstacle with smooth boundary , and @xmath35 the standard laplace operator on @xmath36 , subject to either dirichlet or neumann conditions .",
    "suppose that @xmath37 and @xmath38 satisfy @xmath39 then for @xmath40 solution to the linear schrdinger equation with initial data @xmath41 , the following estimates hold @xmath42;l^{q}(\\omega))}\\leq c\\|f\\|_{h^{s}(\\omega)},\\ ] ] provided that @xmath43 for dirichlet boundary conditions , the estimates hold with @xmath44 .",
    "remark that as an application to the nonlinear schrdinger equation in 3d exterior domains , the authors used their above result and interpolation to establish the @xmath45 strichartz estimate and present a simple proof to the well - posedness result for small energy data to the quintic nonlinear schrdinger equation , a result first obtained by ivanovici and planchon @xcite .",
    "we will use in this paper the besov spaces which are defined here using the spectral localization associated to the domain .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a detailed discussion and references , and we provide only basic definitions here .",
    "let @xmath46 and @xmath47 . on the domain @xmath36 , one has the spectral resolution of the dirichlet laplacian , and we may define smooth spectral projections @xmath48 as continuous operators on @xmath49 ( they are also continuous on @xmath50 for all @xmath23 ) . moreover , just like the whole space case , these projections obey bernstein estimates .",
    "let @xmath51 and let @xmath52 be a spectral localization with respect to the dirichlet laplacian @xmath53 such that @xmath54 .",
    "we say @xmath41 belongs to @xmath55 ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) if @xmath58 and @xmath59 converges to f in @xmath60 .",
    "note that @xmath61 and by analogy we set @xmath62 to be just @xmath63 .",
    "the banach space @xmath64 is equipped with following norm : @xmath65    in our range of interest , this intrinsic definition may be proved to be equivalent with the more well - known definition using the restriction to the domain @xmath36 of functions in @xmath66 .",
    "however , we will not need this equivalence .",
    "we first obtain the following result :    [ main result 1 ] let @xmath36 be @xmath67 , where @xmath1 is a non - trapping obstacle , and @xmath68 .",
    "then , there exists @xmath69 such that the nonlinear equation : @xmath70 admits a unique solution @xmath71 in the function space @xmath72;\\dot{b}^{s_{c},1}_{2}(\\omega))\\cap l^{p-1}([0,t];l^{\\infty}(\\omega)).\\ ] ] moreover , if @xmath13 , then the solution stays in @xmath73 and it is global in time for the defocusing equation .",
    "then , we prove the scattering for the defocusing equation with initial data in @xmath73 for a class of almost star - shaped obstacles satisfying the following geometric condition : given @xmath74 @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the exterior unit normal to @xmath77 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath78 , which corresponds to the star - shaped case , we do nt need the strictness in ( see @xcite ) .",
    "almost star - shaped obstacles that are a natural generalization of the star - shaped were introduced by ivrii in @xcite in the setting of local energy decay for the linear wave equation . in section [ geometry ] , we provide an explicit definition for such obstacles as well as an interpretation of the geometric condition .we obtain the following theorem :    [ mainresult ] let @xmath36 be @xmath67 , where @xmath1 is an almost star - shaped obstacle satisfying the condition , and @xmath13 .",
    "then the global solution for the defocusing equation @xmath79 scatters in @xmath14 .",
    "* acknowledgements*. i would like to thank fabrice planchon for suggesting the problem and commenting on the manuscript .",
    "we want to solve @xmath80 we will set @xmath81 with @xmath82.note that the sobolev space with the invariant norm under the scaling is @xmath83 with @xmath84.using the estimate obtained by blair , smith , and sogge ( theorem [ bsstheorem ] ) , we can obtain another linear estimate in the besov space @xmath85 .",
    "this is stated in the following proposition :    [ lp-1linfty ] let @xmath86 , where @xmath1 is a non - trapping obstacle with smooth boundary , and @xmath35 is the dirichlet laplacian .",
    "then for @xmath40 solution to the linear schrdinger equation with initial data @xmath41 , we have @xmath87;l^{\\infty}(\\omega)}\\lesssim\\|f\\|_{\\dot{b}_{2}^{s_{c},1}(\\omega)}\\ ] ]    for exterior domains in @xmath88 and given any @xmath89 , we have the following strichartz estimate obtained by blair , smith , and sogge @xmath90 on a dyadic block @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is defined via the dirichlet laplacian @xmath35 , the blair - smith - sogge estimate is written as follows @xmath93 for any @xmath89 . this can be easily obtained using and the fact that @xmath92 commutes with @xmath94 as well as a bernstein s inequality.now , we choose @xmath95 , we have @xmath96 but by bernstein we have , @xmath97 hence @xmath98 hence we get the following linear estimate @xmath99 which ends the proof of proposition [ lp-1linfty ] .",
    "now , using the estimate , we can solve the nonlinear equation with initial data in @xmath100 locally in time in the function space @xmath101 given by : for @xmath102 @xmath103;\\dot{b}_{2}^{s_{c},1}(\\omega))\\cap l^{\\frac{3}{1-\\epsilon_{0}}}([0,t];l^{\\infty}(\\omega)).\\ ] ]    set @xmath104 ( or @xmath105 in the focusing case ) and choose @xmath106 small enough so that @xmath107}^{\\frac{3}{1-\\epsilon_{0}}}l^{\\infty}_{x}}<c$ ] for a small constant @xmath108 to be determined and which is linked to the size of the besov norm of @xmath109 .",
    "the larger the latter is , the smaller the former will have to be .",
    "remark that the smallness of this quantity can be made explicit if @xmath4 is in @xmath16 ( not just @xmath100 ) , and then @xmath106 will be like an inverse power of the norm @xmath110 of @xmath4 ( see for example page 22 of @xcite for a similar reasoning ) .",
    "moreover , for the defocusing case , the @xmath16 norm is controlled and thus the local time of existence is uniform and one can consequently iterate the local existence result to a global result .",
    "we define the following mapping for @xmath111 @xmath112 then we have @xmath113;\\dot{b}^{s_{c},1}_{2})}\\\\ & \\lesssim\\|e^{it\\delta}u_{0}+w\\|_{l^{\\infty}_{t}\\dot{b}_{2}^{s_{c},1}}\\|e^{it\\delta}u_{0}+w\\| _ { { l^{\\frac{3}{1-\\epsilon_{0}}}_{t}l^{\\infty}_{x}}}^{\\frac{3}{1-\\epsilon_{0}}}\\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first part can be shown using the linear estimate , as for the second part , it is due to the following lemma ( for the special case @xmath114 and @xmath115 ) :    [ besov ] consider @xmath116 with @xmath117 , then if @xmath118 ( or @xmath119 ) and @xmath120 we have @xmath121    this lemma can be proved by writing @xmath122 and splitting this difference into two paraproducts . for a detailed proof , we refer to lemma 4.10 in @xcite which is given for functions in @xmath123 .",
    "in fact , we are considering a special case of that lemma with @xmath124 .",
    "the time norms are harmless and can be easily inserted using hlder .",
    "note that such a result is by now classical if the domain is just @xmath20 , and where the easiest path to prove it is to use the characterization of besov spaces using finite differences .",
    "by contrast , on domains , @xcite provides a direct proof using paraproducts which are based on the spectral localization .    choosing the small constant @xmath108 such that @xmath125 , the estimate shows that one can have a small ball in @xmath126 of @xmath101 that maps into itself . a similar argument on @xmath127 for @xmath128 shows that @xmath129 is a contraction on the small ball : by lemma [ besov ] ( with @xmath130 ) , if @xmath131 and @xmath132 @xmath133;\\dot{b}^{s_{c},1}_{2})}\\\\ & \\lesssim\\|w - w'\\|_{l^{\\infty}_{t}\\dot{b}_{2}^{s_{c},1}}(\\|u\\|^{\\alpha-1 } _ { l^{\\alpha-1}_{t}l^{\\infty}_{x}}+\\|v\\|^{\\alpha-1 } _ { l^{\\alpha-1}_{t}l^{\\infty}_{x}})\\\\ & + \\|w - w'\\| _ { l^{\\alpha-1}_{t}l^{\\infty}_{x}}(\\|u\\|_{l^{\\infty}_{t}\\dot{b}_{2}^{s_{c},1}}\\|u\\| _ { l^{\\alpha-1}_{t}l^{\\infty}_{x}}^{\\alpha-2}+ \\|v\\|_{l^{\\infty}_{t}\\dot{b}_{2}^{s_{c},1}}\\|v\\|_{l^{\\alpha-1}_{t}l^{\\infty}_{x}}^{\\alpha-2})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the smallness comes from the @xmath134 factors , with @xmath135 .",
    "hence , by the fixed point theorem , there exists a unique @xmath126 in the small ball such that @xmath136 and thus @xmath71 set as @xmath131 is a solution to the nonlinear schrdinger equation that satisfies @xmath137 now , we will show that if the initial data @xmath138 , then the solution @xmath71 remains in @xmath14 .",
    "in fact , if @xmath138 then @xmath139 and @xmath140 ( from now on @xmath110 will always correspond to @xmath141 ) . using the following interpolation inequality @xmath142 and the fact that @xmath143 and @xmath144 we get that @xmath145 thus @xmath146 and the nonlinear equation with initial data @xmath13 has a local solution in @xmath101 given by the duhamel formula .",
    "hence , we have @xmath147 where the nonlinearity is again dealt with by lemma [ besov ] ( with @xmath148 , @xmath149 ) . we also have @xmath150 as the solution @xmath71 is constructed such that its @xmath151 norm is sufficiently small , the above inequalities yield that @xmath152;h_{0}^{1})$ ] .",
    "in this section , we will show that for the defocusing case with initial data in @xmath14 and for domains @xmath36 exterior to star - shaped obstacles as well as for a class of almost star - shaped obstacles ( see section [ geometry ] ) , the solution to the nonlinear equation scatters in @xmath14 .",
    "to prove that is suffices to show that given any interval @xmath153 of time where the solution exists the @xmath154 norm is controlled by a universal constant that is independent @xmath153 . to achieve this",
    "we will use the conservation laws of the mass and energy , as well as additional space - time control of the solution .      for star - shaped obstacles , in addition to the conservation laws of the mass and energy",
    ", we will use the fact that the @xmath155 norm is controlled , which is a consequence of the following result by planchon and vega @xcite :    ( planchon - vega , @xcite)[l4l8 ] let @xmath36 be @xmath67 , where @xmath1 is a star - shaped and bounded domain . then @xmath71 the solution of @xmath156 satisfies @xmath157 where @xmath71 is extended by zero for @xmath158 to make sense of the half - derivative operator .",
    "remark that this result is also true for the linear equation , and it plays the key role in proving the @xmath32 ( with @xmath159 ) strichartz estimate for star - shaped obstacles in their paper .",
    "this is what restricted the range of @xmath23 in @xcite , whereas the result of blair , smith , and sogge ( theorem [ bsstheorem ] ) allows us to get that estimate with a @xmath33 .",
    "now , given any interval @xmath153 of time where the solution exists , and given any @xmath177 there is a finite number of disjoint intervals @xmath178 such that @xmath179 with @xmath180 and @xmath181 @xmath182      let @xmath86 , where @xmath1 is a non - trapping obstacle with smooth boundary , and @xmath35 is the dirichlet laplacian .",
    "then for @xmath40 solution to the linear schrdinger equation with initial data @xmath41 , we have @xmath186      using the duhamel formula and the above estimate shows that the solution we constructed locally is also in @xmath192 , and in particular we have by duhamel on @xmath193\\subset i_{j}=[t_{j},t_{j+1})$ ] : @xmath194    on the other hand , we have the following interpolation inequality @xmath195 with @xmath196 . for simplicity , we choose @xmath197 , and thus @xmath198 . using the fact that @xmath199 is continuously included in @xmath200 and that @xmath201 we get that @xmath202 hence , @xmath203 note that @xmath204 is a continuous function and @xmath205 .",
    "now , since @xmath206 where @xmath207 is a constant that depends on the conserved mass and energy , and yield @xmath208 choosing @xmath209 such that @xmath210 is small enough , we conclude that @xmath211 remains bounded by a universal constant @xmath212 independent of the time interval of existence @xmath153 .",
    "therefore , @xmath213 hence , our global solution satisfies @xmath214 finally , defining @xmath215 as @xmath216 and similarly for @xmath217 , we get the scattering @xmath218      in this section , we will prove the scattering for the defocusing equation for almost star - shaped obstacles @xmath1 satisfying the following geometric condition : given an @xmath184 such that @xmath89 , @xmath219 where @xmath76 is the exterior unit normal to @xmath77.in this case , we lost the @xmath155 control which was obtained under the star - shaped assumption .",
    "however , we will establish a similar control in some @xmath220 norm that will play the same role in proving the scattering .      in 1969 , ivrii introduced the notion of almost star - shaped obstacles in the setting of the linear wave equation .",
    "he proved in @xcite local energy decay results for domains exterior to such obstacles in odd dimensions @xmath221 .",
    "an almost star - shaped obstacle @xmath1 ( @xmath34 ) is defined as follows :    [ def - ivrii ] a bounded open region @xmath1 with a boundary in class @xmath222 is said to be almost star - shaped if there exists a d bounded open neighborhood of @xmath223 , a real - valued function @xmath224 and a constant @xmath225 such that :    * @xmath226 , @xmath227 , @xmath228 @xmath229 . * @xmath230 , @xmath231 .",
    "* the level surfaces @xmath232 are strongly convex ; the radius of curvature in all directions at all points of @xmath233 is uniformly bounded from above . * at points of intersection of the level surfaces with @xmath77 their outer normals and the outer normal to @xmath77 form an angle which is not greater than a right angle .",
    "these obstacles are a natural generalization of the star - shaped obstacles .",
    "if the level surfaces are spheres with a common center , then @xmath1 is star - shaped and conversely .",
    "according to the above definition , an almost star - shaped obstacle with ellipses as level surfaces satisfies the geometric condition , where the strict inequality corresponds to an angle strictly less than a right angle in the 4th condition of definition [ def - ivrii ] .",
    "more explicitly , the function @xmath129 is given by @xmath234 and this corresponds to what is called the gauge function of the convex body delimited by the ellipse given by the equation @xmath235 .",
    "we also remark that the case of almost star - shaped obstacles corresponds to the works of strauss @xcite and morawetz @xcite that followed in 1975 ( independently of ivrii s work which was unknown to them at that time ) on local energy decay for the linear wave equation .",
    "moreover , in the same setting and around the same time in the 70 s , another generalization to the star - shaped case was introduced which is the illuminating geometry .",
    "decay results were obtained for the so - called illuminated from interior and illuminated from exterior obstacles ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , scattering results were recently obtained for the 3d critical nonlinear wave equation in domains exterior to such obstacles ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , we opted to work here with almost star - shaped obstacles and use the gauge function of the ellipse rather than the illuminating geometry ( that would impose using the distance to the ellipse ) mainly because the computation is much easier with the gauge function .",
    "the dog bone like obstacle in figure [ fig : os de chien ] below is an almost star - shaped obstacle ( and also illuminated from interior ) .          in this part",
    ", we will prove that the norm of @xmath71 in some @xmath220 is controlled by a constant depending on the mass and the energy .",
    "this will be a consequence of the following proposition which is an alternative to proposition [ l4l8 ] that is restricted to the star - shaped case :    [ d-1/2 ] let @xmath36 be @xmath67 , with @xmath1 is an obstacle satisfying condition .",
    "assume @xmath71 is a solution to @xmath236 with @xmath237 .",
    "then we have @xmath238 where @xmath239 is the solution to @xmath240 and where we extend @xmath241 by zero for @xmath242 or @xmath243 , so that makes sense for @xmath244 .",

    "this constant may vary from line to line .",
    "moreover , all implicit constants are allowed to depend on the geometry of the obstacle ( in particular , they may and will depend on @xmath184 appearing in ) .",
    "finally , we also have :      we have @xmath251 thus , @xmath250 , @xmath252 and consequently ( by sobolev embedding ) , @xmath253 for all @xmath254 .",
    "now , given any @xmath255 , we can easily prove that @xmath256 and @xmath257 with @xmath258 .",

    "the solution @xmath71 is such that @xmath268 so , @xmath269    using the well known interpolation inequalities for lebesgue and besov spaces , we get that @xmath270 with @xmath271 and @xmath272 for any @xmath1720,1[$ ] . here",

    "we will provide the proof of proposition [ d-1/2 ] following an approach similar to one used by planchon and vega in @xcite to prove proposition [ l4l8 ] .",
    "first , we will state the following remark that will be useful in our computations :        [ boundarycontrol1 ] let @xmath36 be @xmath67 , with @xmath1 is an obstacle satisfying condition .",
    "assume @xmath71 is a solution to @xmath236 with @xmath237 .",
    "then we have the following estimate @xmath294 where @xmath295 and @xmath296 and @xmath297 are the conserved mass and energy .",
    "first , define @xmath27 solution to the problem @xmath240 for star - shaped obstacles , in order to obtain local smoothing near the boundary , planchon and vega ( @xcite ) considered @xmath298 with @xmath299 and computed the double derivative with respect to time of the 4d integral thus overcoming the problem of the wrong sign of the bilaplacian in 2d . to generalize their procedure to obstacles satisfying condition",
    ", we should take a weight of the form @xmath300 to ensure that the boundary term has a right sign .",
    "however , this will not be enough to cover all epsilons with @xmath301 since the bilaplacian will not always have the right sign ( see remark [ thebilaplacian ] ) .",
    "this problem can be solved by increasing the dimension through applying the tensor product technique again .",
    "remark that to ensure a right sign of the bilaplacian it is enough to be in 6d ; but to preserve the symmetry of the computations ( which is essential in proposition [ d-1/2 ] ) , we will apply the tensor product technique again for @xmath248 .",
    "thus we define @xmath302 solution to the 8d problem @xmath303 with @xmath304 now , we consider        and we compute @xmath308 . this is a standard computation and similar to the one @xcite and @xcite , up to slight modifications to the nonlinear term .",
    "we replicate this computation here so that the argument will be self - contained : we have @xmath309 hence , by integration by parts and using the dirichlet boundary condition we get @xmath310 now , @xmath311 integrating by parts again , @xmath312 where @xmath313 is the normal pointing into the domain . thus @xmath314 moreover , by integrating by parts we have @xmath315 and we finally obtain @xmath316 from our choice of the convex function @xmath317 we have that the terms with the hessian as well as those with the laplacian are positive.we also have from remark [ thebilaplacian ] that 8d bilaplacian ( @xmath29 ) @xmath318 is negative @xmath292 .",
    "now , we deal with boundary term .",
    "first , we look at the term @xmath319 with @xmath313 the normal pointing into @xmath320 , we have @xmath321 hence , if @xmath322 @xmath323 which is strictly positive by the geometric condition we imposed .",

    "hence , yields @xmath327 which ends the proof of proposition [ boundarycontrol1 ] .    due to the fact that we are doing the tensor product technique more than once , and we are dealing now with four 2d variables , we will need extra estimates on the boundary .",
    "we have the following proposition :      remark that proposition [ boundarycontrol2 ] is obviously improving over proposition [ boundarycontrol1 ] , as the new weight has less decay in some directions ( actually , no decay in direction @xmath329 or @xmath330 for example ! ) , whereas @xmath317 is uniformly decaying in all directions .",
    "to prove the estimates , we do the same standard procedure as in proposition [ boundarycontrol1 ] with the weight @xmath331 defined as @xmath332 again , we consider @xmath333 and we compute @xmath334 to get @xmath335 note that @xmath331 is convex thus the hessian is positive , and the terms with the laplacian are positive as well . as for the term of the bilaplacian , note that the functions @xmath336 and @xmath337 of @xmath338 can be also viewed as functions of @xmath339 with @xmath340 and @xmath341 .",
    "since the bilaplacian in invariant under rotation , we have @xmath342 and by remark [ thebilaplacian ] , this 6d bilaplacian ( @xmath343 ) is negative .",
    "similarly , @xmath344 , hence we have @xmath345.now , we deal the boundary term in .",
    "first , we want to control the terms we get on the boundary when @xmath346 .",
    "if @xmath347 then @xmath348 introduce @xmath349 thus , @xmath350 and @xmath351 now , we write @xmath352 and substitute in @xmath353 to get @xmath354\\\\ & \\;\\;\\;\\;+\\frac{(w_{1},\\epsilon w_{2})}{2}\\left[\\frac{1}{\\gamma}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1+\\frac{y_{1}w_{1}+\\epsilon y_{2}w_{2}}{\\gamma^{2}}}}-1\\right ) -\\frac{1}{\\gamma}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{1-\\frac{y_{1}w_{1}+\\epsilon y_{2}w_{2}}{\\gamma^{2}}}}-1\\right)\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the fact the @xmath355 is bounded and @xmath356 is large enough , there exists a positive constant @xmath108 such that @xmath357 and thus @xmath358 this implies that @xmath359 so , the boundary term obtained when @xmath347 is controlled by proposition [ boundarycontrol1 ] : @xmath360 similarly for the boundary term generated when @xmath361.now , when @xmath322 , then @xmath362 again by the geometry of the obstacle , we have @xmath363 and thus @xmath364 and @xmath365 and we deal similarly when @xmath366 .",
    "so , finally yields @xmath367    now , we are ready to prove proposition [ d-1/2 ] . again",
    ", we proceed in a similar argument to that in previous propositions , we consider @xmath368 where @xmath369 , with @xmath370 , is the solution to the problem @xmath303 with @xmath371 for @xmath372 where @xmath373 . doing the same standard computation ,",
    "we get @xmath374 the weight @xmath375 is convex and thus the hessian term and the laplacian terms are positive .",
    "moreover , we have @xmath376 now , we control the boundary term .",
    "if @xmath322 and @xmath377 then @xmath378 and we have @xmath379 setting @xmath380 and @xmath381 , we have : @xmath382 , we write @xmath383 and @xmath384 and we substitute in @xmath385 which yields some convenient cancellations in the @xmath386 terms . then , using the fact that @xmath387 is under control and @xmath388 are large enough , there exists a positive constant @xmath389 such that @xmath390 and thus @xmath391 and similarly for @xmath392 .",
    "this yields that @xmath393 and thus the boundary term generated when @xmath322 is controlled by of proposition [ boundarycontrol2 ] , and similarly when @xmath366 .",
    "now , when @xmath347 or @xmath361 , we do a similar procedure but with @xmath394 and we get the same control on the boundary terms by proposition [ boundarycontrol2 ] .",
    "so , finally , yields @xmath395 which actually holds on @xmath396 provided we extend @xmath248 by zero inside the obstacle .",
    "then , by plancherel s theorem we get @xmath397 which ends the proof of proposition [ d-1/2 ] ."
