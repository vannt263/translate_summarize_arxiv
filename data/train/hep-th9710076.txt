    "thus , the higher - order result is no more divergent than the leading - order result .",
    "we do not discuss this calculation in detail here because a similar one is explained in ref .",
    "the calculation done here is more elaborate because there are twice as many vertices but the necessary calculations are routine .",
    "our result is @xmath146 which is consistent with the theory being supersymmetric .",
    "in the schwinger model of two - dimensional electrodynamics with massless fermions there is an anomaly .",
    "if the one - fermion - loop contribution to the photon propagator is calculated naively one obtains a product of two factors ; the first factor vanishes in two - dimensional space , and the second factor is a divergent integral .",
    "if one is not careful , one gets a quantity that is formally @xmath77 .",
    "however , because the integral is divergent , one must evaluate this product by introducing a regulator ; dimensional regulation is an acceptable procedure .",
    "as the regulator is removed one obtains a finite , nonvanishing result for the anomaly , namely , the famous number @xmath147 . in general , one looks for an anomaly when there is a naive cancellation involving divergent quantities that must be regulated .",
    "the question that is raised in this paper is , do we have an anomaly in the @xmath1 expansion that breaks supersymmetry ? specifically , is there an anomaly associated with the cancellation that gives a vanishing ground - state energy density in eq .",
    "( [ e3.7 ] ) ?      in the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ e3.7 ] ) we combine two numbers that are divergent to obtain 0 .",
    "there are several ways to regulate the integral representing @xmath64 .",
    "for example , if we use dimensional regulation and evaluate @xmath64 in @xmath148 dimensions , then for small positive @xmath149 @xmath150 furthermore , in @xmath8-dimensional space , the representation of the dirac matrices has rank @xmath151 .",
    "thus , the trace of a unit matrix in @xmath148 dimensions is @xmath152 thus , the coefficient of the second graph amplitude in eq .",
    "( [ e3.6 ] ) should be multiplied by @xmath153 .",
    "we now see that the two graphs do not exactly cancel ; rather , the difference in the numerical coefficients is of order @xmath149 . combining the two graphs in ( [ e3.6 ] )",

    "\\label{e5.4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because this is a positive number , it suggests that supersymmetry may be broken .",
    "of course , dimensional regulation violates supersymmetry .",
    "thus , it is not clear whether the nonzero result in eq .",
    "( [ e5.4 ] ) is correct or is merely an artifact of the regularization scheme being used .",
    "if a supersymmetric regulation exists then , of course , there will be no anomaly .",
    "conversely , if we could establish rigorously that there does not exist any supersymmetric regulation of the delta expansion , then there really would be a breaking of supersymmetry .",
    "we do not know for certain whether a supersymmetric regulation of the @xmath1 expansion exists .",
    "however , we believe that we have found a relatively simple way to regulate the @xmath1 expansion that is consistent with supersymmetry and thus we believe that there is no anomalous structure and that the ground - state energy is truly identically zero .",
    "this suggests that while it is relatively easy to break parity symmetry , supersymmetry is extremely rigid and is very difficult to break .    our regulation scheme , which we believe respects supersymmetry invariance , is a variant of the proper - time method due to j.  schwinger @xcite .",
    "( it is well known that the proper - time method correctly yields the anomaly in the schwinger model . ) here , we will use this method to define , in an invariant way , the divergent integral @xmath64 . to make contact with the dimensionally regulated result above , let us work in @xmath8 dimensions : @xmath156 here , @xmath157 is a proper - time regulator to be taken to 0 at the end of the calculation .",
    "we now interchange the order of integration in ( [ e5.5 ] ) , and express the momentum integral as the product of @xmath8 one - dimensional integrals : @xmath158 then , the integral representing @xmath64 is immediately expressed in terms of a single regulated integral : @xmath159 if we set @xmath160 as in the previous subsection , the integral converges when @xmath161 , and we obtain the same result as in ( [ e5.1 ] ) , @xmath162 however , if we want to preserve supersymmetry , we must remain in two dimensions , in which case the integral depends logarithmically upon @xmath157 : @xmath163 , \\label{e5.9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is euler s constant .",
    "the obvious advantage of this regulation scheme is that it treats bosons and fermions on an equal footing ; the renormalization of the boson and fermion masses is identical . with this regulation scheme ,",
