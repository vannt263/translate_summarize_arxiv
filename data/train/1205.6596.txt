    "recently , an expansion to quadratic coupling has been proposed  @xcite and the investigation of dissipation - induced  @xcite , noise - induced  @xcite and remote entanglement  @xcite has been of great interest , including a scheme for sensitive force measurements  @xcite and entanglement of macroscopic oscillators  @xcite .",
    "here we show that all this can be implemented in a system consisting of two particles strongly trapped in the cosine mode of a ring cavity , where the two - particle interaction is carried by sideband photons in the sine mode .",

    "a subsequent investigation of momentum correlations reveals classically forbidden positive values in steady state , even in the absence of entanglement .",
    "the steady state shows a strong delocalization of the centre - of - mass independent of the particle separation .",
    "we also show how to generate entanglement either in a pulsed regime or heralded by the detection of photons .",
    "analytical calculations are carried out in the regime of strong particle confinement and matched to the more generally valid numerical simulations with good agreement .",
    "finally , the occurrence of correlations in the system is explained in a simple adiabatic model .",
    "we structure this presentation in two major parts according to the gaussian / non - gaussian nature of the system dynamics .",
    "entanglement on trajectories and that on average as well as momentum correlations during the non - gaussian dynamics of the two atoms in the cavity are numerically investigated in the beginning , while the gaussian approximation makes the topic of the second major part of the paper .",
    "this part corresponds either to atoms in very deep traps ( to compare to the results obtained in the first part ) or more generally to a wide range of optomechanical systems in the linear regime and with diverse physical realizations ( moving membranes , levitated nano - spheres etc . ) .",

    "the direct solution of the master equation   is computationally very demanding owing to the large hilbert space of the joint particles - field system .",
    "therefore , we resort to monte carlo wavefunction simulations  @xcite , in which the system is coherently evolved between the so - called `` quantum jumps '' .",
    "these jumps correspond to a photon detected at the resonator output  @xcite .",
    "besides the more favourable usage of computer resources , single trajectories also provide an additional insight into the microscopic processes in the system .",
    "the simulations were efficiently implemented with the freely available c++qed framework  @xcite and performed in a joint momentum- and fock basis .",

    "the logarithmic negativity  @xcite already after the first jump approaches the value for a maximally entangled bell state and the correlation reaches a value of @xmath22 .",
    "the emerging state corresponds to a superposition of two particles moving to the right and two particles moving to the left such that the centre - of - mass momentum remains zero . as we will see later this behaviour is caused by the excitation of a single particle into the first excited state within the trap .",
    "beginning with the second jump the system is subject to fast oscillations which are of the order of the trap frequency .",
    "note that only the field is dissipative in our model and induces quantum jumps .",

    "it has to be directly computed from the density operator .",
    "it is therefore possible that the logarithmic negativity of a mixture of entangled states is smaller than the weighted average of the individual values . a prominent example for this is the equal statistical mixture of two bell states , which is not entangled .    .",

    "it is generally not possible to exactly keep track of each emitted photon due to the detector efficiency , i.e.  one can not exactly follow a certain quantum trajectory .",
    "hence , the system always evolves into a mixed state and if a photon is observed ( measured ) outside of the resonator , it is impossible to determine whether it was the first , the second and so on .",
    "naturally , the question arises whether effects observed on single trajectories ( like entanglement ) `` survive '' this averaging and can still be expected to be observable after jumps .",
    "every time a photon is detected , the mixed state inside the resonator is projected into the state @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the density matrix evolved according to the master equation  .",
    "interestingly , the momentum correlation coefficient   is nearly constant ( @xmath22 for @xmath24 and @xmath33 on the cooling sideband , respectively ) , regardless of the time the jump occurred at , see figure  [ fig_rhoj ] also .",

    "this is consistent with the picture of the mode being incoherently populated through particle noise  perfectly localized particles do not scatter . hence the field expectation vanishes and",
    "only its variance gives a contribution .",
    "so far , we have studied the mainly numerically accessible general system   of two particles in a ring resonator .",
    "now , we investigate the special case of tightly confined particles allowing for more analytical insight into the dynamics . in this limit",
    ", it is justified to keep only the first- and second - order terms in the expansion of the trigonometric factors and the hamiltonian   can be mapped onto the linearized optomechanical model @xmath37 as shown in  @xcite . here",
    "we have defined @xmath38 , @xmath39 , the oscillator length @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the scaling of the oscillator length suggests that the lamb  dicke regime @xmath42 may also be reached for very heavy particles in shallower traps . as we do not consider any direct particle  particle interactions , the hamiltonian   is also valid for particles not confined in the same , but rather in distant sites within the resonator .",
    "interestingly , the hamiltonian   applies to a whole class of systems .",
    "a few well - studied realizations are ( i ) a cavity with vibrating end mirrors where the mirror ",
    "light interaction is always linear and governed mainly by the cavity length and the zero point motion of the mechanics  @xcite , ( ii ) two light membranes inside a cavity field positioned at the maximum slope of the field amplitude where the coupling depends on the reflective properties of the membranes and is increased with decreasing mass  @xcite and ( iii ) very light nano - sized dielectric spheres held inside the cavity field either by an external trapping light mode or by means of optical tweezers  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian   is quadratic in the bosonic operators so that an initially gaussian state remains gaussian throughout the time evolution .",
    "gaussian states are completely defined by a displacement vector and a covariance matrix @xmath43 $ ] , with @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and the field quadratures @xmath47 and @xmath48  @xcite .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , the time evolution of @xmath49 is determined by the equation ( its steady - state version is called the lyapunov equation ) @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the drift- and diffusion matrices appearing in stochastic heisenberg  langevin equations equivalent to the master equation .",
    "the steady - state solution of   for the covariances is @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( both particles behave the same way ) .",
    "it only exists in the cooling regime @xmath13 since the momentum variance is only positive for red detuning .",
    "the momentum covariance is also genuinely positive . for @xmath18",
    "we find the simple ( @xmath55-independent ) expression @xmath56 which is precisely the ratio of the stokes- ( @xmath57 , heating ) and anti - stokes ( @xmath58 , cooling ) scattering rates found when adiabatically eliminating the cavity field  @xcite .",
    "these rates @xmath59 also define the time scale @xmath60 on which the steady state is reached .",
    "@xmath18 has a minimum at @xmath61 and approaches unity for @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "from the form of the steady - state covariance matrix we can deduce that steady - state entanglement between the particles can only occur if @xmath64 , which implies squeezing of the position variable .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the entanglement criterion derived in  @xcite .",
    "see figure  [ fig_momentumcorrelation_lyapunov ] for an example of the lyapunov time evolution . for such deep potentials ( a regime",
    "which we can numerically analyse by changing the effective parameters @xmath65 and @xmath55 to the values listed in figure  [ fig_momentumcorrelation_lyapunov ] ) we restricted ourselves to monte carlo simulations of the master equation containing the hamiltonian  .",
    "again , the c++qed framework provides a helpful basis for their numerical implementation as it also supports the simulation of coupled oscillators .",
    "the steady - state covariance matrix reveals strong correlations between the particles and the field quadratures , making it intuitively clear that the reduced conditional density matrix for the particles strongly differs from its steady - state counterpart .",
    "each photon detection highly influences the joint state of particles and cavity field .",
    "we show both density matrices in figure  [ fig_momentumcorrelation_lyapunov ] . the logarithmic negativity for the conditional density matrix is @xmath66 and @xmath18 is found to be @xmath67 .",
    "due to the particles  field correlations in steady state the conditional density matrix   does not describe a gaussian state .",
    "indeed , it reveals a double - peak structure .",

    "field interaction is much stronger than in figure  [ fig_singletrajectory ] where @xmath72 . ]    given that steady state dynamics shows little or no traces of the entanglement that is clearly present in individual trajectories , we pursue now an alternative road that investigates the transient regime .",
    "such a regime could for example be reached with short light pulses that can be used to generate build - up of motional correlations in the system . while we are free to explore any regime numerically , the problem can be analytically tackled mainly in the adiabatic case where the cavity mode can be eliminated from the dynamics , when @xmath73 or @xmath74  @xcite .",
    "we verify , however , that the generality is not lost since numerical investigations show the optimal entanglement regime indeed being around the point analytically treated .",
    "we skip the cumbersome analytical elimination procedure ( that closely follows the one used in  @xcite ) and simply make use of the simple form of the end result that shows displacement  displacement coupling of the reduced bipartite system , @xmath75 , with @xmath76 a second result of such an elimination procedure is that decay of the system can occur in a correlated fashion , namely with an effective jump operator proportional to @xmath77 . now",
    ", we choose the operating conditions such that @xmath78 reduces to a simple beam splitter interaction @xmath79 and point out a very general conclusion ( see  @xcite ) that this interaction does not lead to entanglement when starting in non - correlated initial states but rather to a simple state swap process where in the limit of strong coupling ( coupling larger than decoherence rates ) , a quantum state of a subsystem can be written on the other subsystem .",
    "than , taking advantage of the correlated decay , we show that transient entanglement is present in transient dynamics .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig_transient_entanglement ] where we show the time evolution of the logarithmic negativity .",
    "the relatively large entanglement obtained at half of the interaction time ( defined by the inverse of the effective coupling strength @xmath55 ) can be accessed in an experimental situation for example by the use of laser pulses of tailored shape and duration .    , @xmath69 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "]    our effective optomechanical hamiltonian   is formally similar to a model describing the microscopic dynamics of self - organization of particles in a cavity field  @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of single trajectories there can be explained with the help of an adiabatic model .",
    "we now strive to develop a model in the spirit of  @xcite , capable of describing the behaviour of single monte carlo trajectories of the master equation containing the hamiltonian  . to this aim , we diagonalize the scattering operator @xmath82 to obtain the new particle basis @xmath83 containing radiative ( eigenvalue @xmath84 , they always appear with both signs @xmath85 ) and non - radiative ( @xmath86 ) states . ignoring terms stemming from the oscillator energies for the moment ,",
    "the radiative states radiate a field @xmath87 with @xmath88 .",
    "the crucial assumption now is adiabaticity ( cavity decay assumed to define the fastest time scale ) , i.e.  we assume each particle state @xmath89 to be correlated with its associated unperturbed field state to find the approximated joint particle  field stochastic state vector @xmath90 the coefficients @xmath91 are determined by the effective conditional monte carlo time evolution generated by the non - hermitian hamiltonian ( abbreviating @xmath92 ) @xmath93 for the particles only .",
    "its hermitian part contains the oscillator energies expressed in the scattering basis and couples the constituents of the latter .    from the form of the state vector",
    "one can conclude what happens if a photon is detected . applying the jump operator @xmath94 on the internal state   at time @xmath95 yields @xmath96 .",
    "hence , all information about the non - radiative contributions are erased and the relative phases between the radiative states change sign ( as for each @xmath97 there exists also an eigenvalue @xmath98 ) . since @xmath99 the reduced density matrix for the particles directly after a jump mainly contains the pure state @xmath100 ( during the time evolution the particle state reads @xmath101 ) . inserting the coefficients for a state describing two particles in the ground state ,",
    "the first jump excites one of them and the photon number increases by a factor of 3 .",
    "the resulting state of the particles @xmath102 is entangled with @xmath103 and correlated with @xmath104 .",
    "beginning with the second jump , fast oscillations with a frequency determined by @xmath65 build up , which is in qualitative agreement with single trajectories of the ring resonator model as shown in figure  [ fig_singletrajectory ] . this way it is possible to qualitatively and quantitatively reconstruct single trajectories of the optomechanical model  .",
    "starting from two particles in a ring resonator , our conclusions are quite general .",
    "we have proposed a tripartite optomechanical system with two identical oscillators that can be correlated via the mediation of a photon field and the interaction amplified by the cavity confinement .",
    "the gaussian evolution of the reduced mechanical bipartition has been followed both numerically and analytically , while non - gaussian effects owing to the deviation from the bilinear hamiltonian have been investigated numerically .",
    "the non - intuitive and classically forbidden positive momentum correlations are an important result of the paper , and are interpreted as strong delocalizations ( superpositions ) of the centre - of - mass independent of the particle separation and thus of the extension of the effective system ; this suggests possible use of the setup to test the quantum - classical boundary .",
    "furthermore , we have studied entanglement on single monte carlo trajectories as well as of the averaged density matrix . entanglement heralded by photodetection has also been investigated .",
    "transient entanglement as shown here can also be exploited in a pulsed regime where light pulses can drive the mechanical bipartition into a strongly entangled state .",
