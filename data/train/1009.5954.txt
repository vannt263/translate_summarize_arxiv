    "experiments were performed in a closed 2 liter vessel , filled to a precision of 0.1 torr using the method of partial pressures .",
    "the video shows schlieren images from 3 fuel rich mixtures of n - hexane in air , 3.4% , 4.74% , and 6.23% , which elucidate the three different behaviors : single flame propagation , multiple flames , and puffing flames .",
    "the first mode involves a single flame propagating until it reaches the vessel walls as shown in the first sequence . in the second mode ,",
    "two to three flames ignite sequentially , as shown in the second schlieren video .",
    "the final mode corresponds to a continuously puffing flame as seen throughout the duration of the video ( about six seconds ) , of which a portion is shown here .",
    "all three experiments were performed at 101kpa initial pressure and the mixtures ignite when the glow plug reaches around 900 k."
