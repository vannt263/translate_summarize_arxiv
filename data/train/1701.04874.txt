    "are suggested to be present in iron pnictides @xcite , especially in heavily hole - doped systems @xcite .",
    "in addition to replacing @xmath9 in @xmath9fe@xmath10as@xmath11 ( @xmath12 ca , sr , ba ) with alkaline metals ( k , na , rb , cs ) @xcite , hole - doping in iron pnictides can be achieved through mn or cr doping on fe site although no superconductivity is induced in these cases @xcite .",
    "doping cu on fe site presents an intriguing case , whereas at low doping levels cu is suggested to dope electrons @xcite , at higher concentrations cu has a 3@xmath13 configuration and acts as a hole - dopant @xcite .",
    "however , in cu doped @xmath9fe@xmath11as@xmath11 , resistivity remains @xmath14 throughout the whole phase diagram with no signs of strengthened electronic correlations @xcite .",

    "recent transport @xcite , scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) @xcite , angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy @xcite , and optical conductivity @xcite measurements demonstrated that with significant ( @xmath19 ) cu doping , nafe@xmath0cu@xmath1as acquires an insulating ground state .",

    "nafe@xmath0cu@xmath1as is more correlated because of its larger iron pnictogen height which results in a small magnetic excitation bandwidth @xcite , hole - doping effect of cu in nafe@xmath0cu@xmath1as is not counteracted by the formation of as - as covalent bonds and the local potential differences between cu and fe reduces the hopping between fe sites @xcite .",
    "since the antiferromagnetically ordered mott insulating phase of nafe@xmath0cu@xmath1as at @xmath22 is continuously connected to an albeit somewhat far away superconducting phase at @xmath23 @xcite , it would be important to elucidate whether the superconducting state in nafe@xmath0cu@xmath1as @xcite is similar to other iron pnictide systems .",
    "one hallmark of unconventional superconductivity in iron pnictides is the appearance of a neutron spin resonance mode in the superconducting state at the antiferromagnetic ( af ) ordering wave vector of their parent compounds @xcite .",
    "the energy of the resonance approximately scales with the superconducting transition temperature @xmath8 or the superconducting gap @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the appearance of the resonance mode is typically accompanied by gapping of the normal state spectral weight below the resonance energy @xcite .",
    "both the resonance and the associated spin gap are typically interpreted as due to quasi - nested fermi surfaces that results in a collective bound - state inside the superconducting gap @xcite . within this picture , the resonance mode is evidence for unconventional superconductivity with sign - changing superconducting order parameters on different parts of the fermi surface @xcite .",
    "the resonance in bafe@xmath11as@xmath11-derived superconductors display significant dispersion along @xmath5-axis in the underdoped regime @xcite , and becomes @xmath25-independent in the well - overdoped region @xcite . in electron - doped nafe@xmath0co@xmath1as ,",

    "the energy of the single resonance mode in well - overdoped nafe@xmath0co@xmath1as does not scale with @xmath8 , likely due to multi - orbital physics and impurity effects @xcite .",
    "since superconducting domes are absent in cu - doped @xmath9fe@xmath11as@xmath11 @xcite , it is unclear if superconductivity induced by cu - doping has similar electronic and magnetic properties as their electron / hole - doped counterparts . as nafe@xmath0cu@xmath1as exhibits bulk superconductivity similar to those of nafe@xmath0co@xmath1as @xcite , superconducting nafe@xmath0cu@xmath1as offers a unique case to study the effect of the stronger impurity potential of cu @xcite on the resonance mode .    in this work ,",

    "a single resonance mode that disperses weakly along @xmath5-axis is seen in nafe@xmath6cu@xmath7as , similar to slightly overdoped nafe@xmath0co@xmath1as @xcite .",
    "similar to what was found in heavily overdoped nafe@xmath0co@xmath1as @xcite , the resonance mode is at an higher energy than what is expected from scaling with @xmath8 , likely related to the stronger impurity potential of cu compared to co @xcite , despite the low cu concentration of @xmath29 .",
    "the presence of both a putative quantum critical point in the phase diagram and a neutron spin resonance in superconducting nafe@xmath0cu@xmath1as is similar to other iron pnictide superconductors .",
    "since nafe@xmath0cu@xmath1as can be continuously tuned to an antiferromagnetically ordered insulating phase with significant electronic correlations near @xmath30 @xcite , these results suggest electronic correlations to be an essential ingredient of superconductivity in iron pnictides .",

    "6(b ) , an superconducting - order - parameter - like increase below @xmath8 is observed .",
    "the weak resonance mode in nafe@xmath0cu@xmath1as is likely a result of the stronger impurity potential of cu , which is also likely responsible for the lower optimal @xmath8 in nafe@xmath0cu@xmath1as @xcite compared to nafe@xmath0co@xmath1as @xcite and the near - absence of superconductivity in ba(fe@xmath0cu@xmath1)@xmath11as@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "compared to ba(fe@xmath0cu@xmath1)@xmath11as@xmath11 in which superconductivity is nearly absent , the presence of a superconducting dome in nafe@xmath0cu@xmath1as may be related to the lower cu concentration needed to suppress the magnetic order . in a similar vein , lower concentration of ni in nafe@xmath0ni@xmath1as",
    "was found to cause magnetic order to remain long - range and commensurate approaching optimal superconductivity @xcite , in contrast to co- and ni - doped bafe@xmath11as@xmath10 in which the magnetic order becomes short - range and incommensurate near optimal - doping @xcite .",
    "the impurity potential and concentration of dopants therefore has significant effects on the physical properties of iron pnictide superconductors .",
    "the resonance mode in slightly overdoped nafe@xmath6cu@xmath7as with @xmath65 k is at @xmath89 mev for @xmath53 , corresponding to @xmath90 .",

    "therefore , due to multi - orbital physics and impurity effects , there appears to be no simple relationship between @xmath96 and @xmath8 in doped nafeas .",
    "specifically , both the concentration of dopants [ slightly overdoped and heavily overdoped nafe@xmath0co@xmath1as ] and impurity potential of dopants [ slightly overdoped nafe@xmath0co@xmath1as and nafe@xmath0cu@xmath1as ] seem to increase the ratio @xmath97 . in cuprate superconductors",
    "it was found spectral weight of the resonance mode scales linearly with @xmath98 @xcite , where @xmath99 is threshold of the particle - hole continuum .",
    "this means as @xmath96 moves closer to the particle - hole continuum , spectral weight of the resonance also collapses .",
    "a similar effect might also contribute to the weak resonance mode in nafe@xmath6cu@xmath7as , as the high ratio of @xmath96 and @xmath100 suggests the resonance is likely closer to the particle - hole continuum compared to nafe@xmath70co@xmath71as .",
    "similarly , the broader resonance at @xmath52 and 1 compared to @xmath53 in nafe@xmath6cu@xmath7as [ fig .",
    "3(b ) , ( d ) and ( f ) ] may be due to the mode at @xmath52 and 1 being at a higher energy , and experience stronger interactions with particle - hole excitations that broaden the mode .",
    "alternatively , spin - orbit coupling found to be present in many iron pnictide superconductors @xcite and causes energy - splitting of resonance modes polarized along different crystallographic directions @xcite , also results in broadening of the resonance mode seen in unpolarized neutron scattering experiments .",
    "polarized neutron scattering experiments are needed to distinguish between these scenarios .",

    "the observation of a spin resonance mode in superconducting nafe@xmath0cu@xmath1as demonstrates that the superconducting state is similar to other iron pnictide superconductors , and therefore electronic correlations should be an integral part of the physics of iron pnictide superconductors .",

    "<S> these results are similar to other iron pnictides superconductors despite the superconducting phase in nafe@xmath0cu@xmath1as is continuously connected to an antiferromagnetically ordered insulating phase near @xmath3 with significant electronic correlations . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , electron correlations is an important ingredient of superconductivity in nafe@xmath0cu@xmath1as and other iron pnictides . </S>"
