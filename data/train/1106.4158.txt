    "since salem and longuet - higgins pointed out that the peierls instability in polyacene @xcite should be conditional and thus distinct from that in polyacetylene @xcite , its ground state has been studied by numerous theoreticians with a variety of numerical tools .",
    "polyacene consists of linearly fused benzene rings and is the next simplest polymer to polyacetylene . nevertheless , the order of the energetic stability in its structural isomers is still under discussion .",
    "the _ aromatic _ ( am ) configuration of regular lattice closely competes with two types of peierls - distorted structure : double bonds in a _",
    "pattern and those in a _",
    "trans _ pattern , which read as in - phase ( ip ) and out - of - phase ( op ) bond order waves ( bows ) in a couple of rows , respectively .",
    "standard- and extended - hckel crystalline - orbital calculations at an early stage @xcite pointed to the op - bow phase as the most stable .",
    "band - structure calculations on a modified - neglect - of - diatomic - overlap ( mndo ) basis @xcite followed to find the ip - bow phase instead to be the most stable .",
    "while modern computational approaches such as quantum monte carlo @xcite and density - matrix renormalization group @xcite also supported the ip - bow phase favored over the op - bow one , there exist not a few arguments @xcite that ip and op bows are almost isoenergetic .",
    "they are indeed degenerate with each other unless we take account of the electron itinerancy beyond the nearest - neighbor hopping @xcite and/or the electronic correlation beyond the hartree - fock ( hf ) scheme .",
    "@xcite various _ ab initio _",
    "calculations @xcite further show that whether and how polyacene undergoes lattice distortion critically depend on the supposed electronic correlation and the imposed boundary condition .",
    "there is thus every reason to believe that the _ cis_- and _ trans_-distorted isomers as well as the regular structure may coexist due to local defects and/or thermal excitations .",
    "then a query , is there any idea of designing the electronic structure of polyacene other than energetically ? we demonstrate that _ optics _ can be the answer .",
    "we stimulate a renewed interest in polyacene : optical observation and manipulation of its isomers rather than energetically ranking them .",
    "there are transition - metal - based ladder materials and some of them @xcite may also be interesting in the context of varied structural instabilities . among others are platinum - halide double - chain compounds , where charge - density - wave ( cdw ) states of the ip and op types are both realized .",

    "@xcite the intersite electron - phonon coupling brings bow varieties into the hydrocarbon ladders , while the intrasite electron - phonon coupling brings cdw varieties into the platinum - halide ladders .",
    "indeed the ip - cdw and op - cdw states also exhibit distinct optical features , @xcite but they are never yet found in a single material . because they are made in different energy structures , @xcite they are much less exchangeable with each other whether by light irradiation @xcite or by applying pressure @xcite . on the other hand , the ip - bow and ob - bow states in polyacene are isoenergetic and thus able to coexist .",

    "the initial excitation density is determined by the light intensity and a threshold in it , if any , should originate from an energy barrier in the relaxation path .",
    "the critical number of excited electrons is not so decisive as it is in a single chain , @xcite because the spatial degrees of freedom in charge - transfer excitations due to the ladder - like lattice structure of polyacene may bypass the relaxation .",

    "figure [ f : eph4.8evdynop23 - 4 ] , demonstrating geminate recombinations of domain walls in the early stage , implies that correlated electrons encounter energy barriers on the way of photogenerated excitons being self - trapped and further dissociated into distant kinks and antikinks .",
    "a correlation - induced energy barrier on the relaxation path to far distant domain walls is observed in platinum - halide chain compounds as well , @xcite which are well known to be photoactive peierls insulators .",
    "since a valley precedes the barrier , coulomb interactions stimulate the frank - condon state to relax and accelerate its localization .",

    "the initial op - bow state of correlated electrons is much more quickly and smoothly replaced by the photoinduced ip - bow phase once the excitation density reaches the threshold .",
    "the promotion of op - to - ip - bow conversion is also recognizable as a correlation effect . with a few electrons being excited ,",
    "the converted fraction amounts to four fifths in the correlated case but stays less than two fifths in the uncorrelated case .",
    "correlated electrons possess an adiabatic potential energy surface full of ups and downs .",
    "once they climb over the energy barriers and find a stable configuration , they are unlikely to swing back to the initial state .    the macroscopic oscillation of uncorrelated electrons in their photoconversion to the ip - bow state and the correlation - driven globalization of the ip - bow domain are both understandable by observing kink excitations in more detail .",

    "their degeneracy is lifted and those with excess spin ( charge ) density in their centers are relatively stabilized ( destabilized ) . in the eph calculations some of the kink excitations indeed bear net spins and it is their intrachain interactions that develop and hold the induced ip - bow arrangement against the op - bow background . in a successful op - to - ip transition [ cf .",

    "the reduction of both ip - bow and op - bow strengths with increasing excitation density [ figs .",
    "[ f : p+-](a)[f : p+-](d ) ] is also attributable to the free kinks and thus - unlimited domain - wall nucleation .",
    "a variety of photoinduced phase transitions have so far been observed and analyzed indeed .",
