    "deuteron - induced nuclear reactions are widely used for studying the spectroscopic properties and the structure of nuclei .",
    "the importance of such reactions in experimental nuclear physics is associated with both the simplicity in obtaining monochromatic deuteron beams with the precisely calibrated polarization and a large yield of @xmath1-reactions in comparison with reactions induced by other charged particles .",
    "the majority of theoretical works on deuteron stripping reactions were published in 1950s1970s .",
    "a surge of interest in those reactions , which has been observed in the last decade , was connected with intensive researches of radioactive nuclei with an excess of protons or neutrons near the stability valley . in those reactions , besides the emergence of a residual nucleus in the bound state , the formation of resonant states also becomes probable  @xcite .",
    "this circumstance makes the nucleon - transfer reactions a unique tool for studying unstable nuclei and astrophysical reactions of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 types .    in this work ,",
    "the inclusive deuteron stripping reaction was considered .",
    "its formalism for the case of intermediate energies was proposed for the first time by serber  @xcite and developed in works by akhiezer and sitenko  @xcite . in work",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the multiple integral in the expression for the reaction cross - section  @xcite can be calculated analytically by expanding the integrands in the basis of gaussoid functions .",
    "the scattering phases were calculated at that in the framework of glauber formalism , making use of the double folding potential  @xcite and the tabulated distributions of the target nucleus density  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the final result ( the cross - section ) depended on a single parameter corresponding to the normalization of the imaginary part of nucleon - nucleus potential .",
    "this approach was used to describe the differential cross - sections of @xmath4h@xmath5he reaction  @xcite at relativistic energies of incident deuterons .",
    "the application of the deuteron wave function with a correct asymptotic at large distances between nucleons was shown to be important at calculations .    by continuing work  @xcite , in this work ,",
    "a more complicated problem was considered ; namely , the calculation of observables for the inclusive polarized - deuteron stripping reaction .",
    "the microscopic description for the distributions of nucleon density and scattering phases was also introduced .",
    "this procedure made it possible to keep the number of fitting parameters to a minimum and , in such a manner , to obtain a quantitative description of the experiment .",
    "besides , the model itself and the limits of its applicability to the kinematics of the reaction concerned were verified . notice that , in this approach , the reaction density matrix is a five - fold integral only formally , because the profile functions , which the density matrix depends on , are also expressed in terms of multiple integrals . therefore , generally speaking , we have rather a complicated computational problem .    nevertheless ,",
    "as will be shown below , the final formulas for the cross - section and analyzing power can be reduced to algebraic expressions , namely , multiple sums of elementary functions , if gaussoid functions are used as integrands . notice that a similar trick is applied rather often : in the variational approach to the description of bound states  @xcite , for the parametrization of nuclear charge densities in the ground state of nucleus  @xcite , and in scattering problems  @xcite , which makes it possible to calculate the corresponding scattering phases and form factors analytically .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ secii ] is devoted to the description of formalism applied while calculating the angular ( energy ) distributions of cross - sections and polarizations for nucleons that arise in the deuteron stripping reaction . in section  [ seciii ] ,",
    "the results of numerical calculations for the differential cross - sections and analyzing powers are discussed and compared with corresponding experimental data .",
    "section  [ seciv ] contains conclusions .",
    "the most important auxiliary formulas used to simplify the formalism description are given in appendices .",
    "light and medium nuclei were selected as targets , because in this case and in the case of intermediate energies , the coulomb interaction can be neglected .",
    "let a proton be a particle that arises in the deuteron stripping reaction .",
    "the angular distribution of protons arising in the reaction @xmath0 is described by the formula  @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the polarization of incident deuterons , and @xmath8 the polarization of protons arising in the non - polarized deuteron stripping reaction .",
    "the cross - section for the latter reaction equals @xmath9 . the quantity @xmath8 is defined in terms of the density matrix @xmath10 as follows  @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 are pauli s matrices .",
    "let the deuteron move in the positive direction of @xmath13-axis in the cartesian coordinate system , so that the @xmath14-plane is the impact parameter plane .",
    "the proton and neutron of the deuteron will be designated by subscripts  1 and 2 , respectively . in the diffraction approximation ,",
    "the general expression for the density matrix of stripping reaction looks like  @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the neutron impact parameter vector , @xmath17 the corresponding profile function ; the quantity @xmath18 is the probability amplitude that the proton has the momentum @xmath19 and the neutron is located at the point @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the deuteron wave function .",
    "the neutron profile function @xmath17 in ( [ eq3 ] ) contains only the radial part , i.e. @xmath22 , whereas the proton one , @xmath23 , depends also on the spin  @xcite :    @xmath24    where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are the impact parameter , the constant of spin - orbit interaction between the proton and the nucleus , and the phase shift , respectively ; and @xmath28 is the vector of the incident deuteron momentum .    if the integrand in ( [ eq3 ] ) includes gaussian functions , the density matrix can be calculated explicitly . without loss of generality ,",
    "let us expand the functions @xmath29 and @xmath21 in series of gaussoid basis functions , @xmath30 @xmath31 where @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the root - mean - square radius of target nucleus .    analytical integration in ( [ eq3 ] ) with functions ( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) , and the calculation of the traces of corresponding matrices in the numerator and denominator of formula ( [ eq2 ] ) bring us to the expressions @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( see appendix  [ appa ] ) .",
    "therefore , the proton polarization is determined by the formula @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the transverse component of the momentum @xmath38 .",
    "the magnitudes @xmath39 and @xmath40 of the @xmath19-vector components are related to the proton energy @xmath41 and the proton emission angle @xmath42 in the laboratory frame by the relationships  @xcite @xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the nucleon mass , and @xmath46 the initial energy of deuteron .",
    "the cross - section of non - polarized - deuteron stripping reaction , after which the wave vector of emitted proton falls within the interval @xmath47 , is determined by the denominator in ( [ eq8 ] ) : @xmath48 in order to find the dependences of polarization ( [ eq8 ] ) and cross - section ( [ eq11 ] ) on the proton emission angle , the expression obtained for @xmath49 and @xmath50 have to be integrated over the @xmath13-component of vector @xmath19  @xcite . by expressing the components of @xmath47 in the cylindrical coordinate system and taking into account ( [ eq9 ] )",
    ", we obtain @xmath51 where @xmath52 @xmath53 cross - section ( [ eq12 ] ) and the angle @xmath42 were transformed into their counterparts in the center - of - mass system making use of kinematic relations from work  @xcite .",
    "the formalism described in the previous section was applied to analyze experimental data ( the cross - section and the analyzing power ) obtained for @xmath0 stripping reactions on the @xmath54 and @xmath55 nuclei at the deuteron energy @xmath56  mev  @xcite .    when expanding the wave function @xmath21 in series ( [ eq7 ] ) , tabulated data for the s - component of deuteron wave function obtained with the help of realistic @xmath57-potential nijm  i  @xcite were used .",
    "the profile functions @xmath29 , which were expanded in series ( [ eq6 ] ) , were first calculated in the eikonal approximation ( see appendix  b ) making use of the tabulated nuclear density distributions for the @xmath54 and @xmath55 nuclei taken from work  @xcite . the number @xmath58 of terms in expansions ( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) was taken to equal 12 .",
    "the values of spin - orbit parameters in ( [ eq5 ] ) were determined from the relations  @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 are the relevant parameters for the central and spin - orbit parts of the nucleon - nucleus optical potential . from the data of work  @xcite",
    ", it follows that , for the proton energy @xmath64  mev , the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath26 are equal to 0.12 and 0.07 , respectively , for the @xmath65 mg target nucleus , and to 0.13 and 0.08 , respectively , for @xmath66ca .    the coefficients in expansions ( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) together with quantities ( [ eq15 ] ) were used to calculate the angular distribution of protons , @xmath67\\sigma_{0}(\\theta ) , \\label{eq16}\\ ] ] where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the polarization and cross - section ( [ eq12 ] ) in the center - of - mass system .",
    "the polarization of deuteron beam , @xmath70 , amounted to about 0.5  @xcite or 0.52  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "1 , cross - sections ( [ eq16 ] ) and analyzing powers @xmath71  @xcite calculated for polarized - deuteron stripping reactions on the @xmath54 and @xmath72 nuclei at @xmath56  mev are depicted by solid curves .",
    "the dashed curves were obtained for the model function @xmath73 the value of the parameter @xmath74 was selected to equal @xmath75  @xmath76 , at which formula ( [ eq17 ] ) reproduced the experimental mean - square radius of deuteron  @xcite .",
    "the dash - dotted curves correspond to the results of calculations carried out in works  @xcite for the quantities @xmath77 and @xmath78 in the framework of the adiabatic distorted wave approximation  @xcite .     stripping reactions on the @xmath54  ( 1 ) and @xmath55  ( 2 ) nuclei at a deuteron energy of 56  mev .",
    "see further explanations in the text .",
    "experimental data were taken from works @xcite .",
    "[ fig1],width=8 ]    the experimental data were fitted using a single fitting parameter @xmath79 , the normalization parameter for the imaginary part of double folding potential ( see appendix  [ appb ] ) .",
    "its values amounted to 0.24 for the @xmath65 mg target nucleus and 0.19 for @xmath66ca . by varying the parameter @xmath79 , the both dependences , @xmath77 and @xmath78 ,",
    "were fitted simultaneously to the relevant experimental data .",
    "the parameter @xmath79 was found to affect the shape of the curve @xmath78 , but not the slope of the linear section in the dependence @xmath77 .",
    "direct nuclear reactions , including the stripping one , are surface reactions  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the calculated observable quantities are expected to be sensitive to the asymptotics of the wave functions of interacting particles , which is confirmed by specific calculations . from fig .  1 , one can see that deuteron model function ( [ eq17 ] ) , which has an incorrect asymptotic at large nucleon - nucleon distances , does not allow the cross - sections and analyzing powers to be described adequately ( the dashed curves ) .",
    "notice that the deuteron stripping problem considered above was solved here exactly , making no additional simplifications and restrictions , which could affect the result of numerical calculation . from the analysis of the behavior of solid curves in fig .",
    "1 , it follows that the calculation results satisfactorily describe the corresponding experimental data for the angles @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , in the case of the incident deuteron energy @xmath56  mev and the @xmath54 and @xmath81nuclei , the applicability region of diffraction approximation for the description of @xmath0 reaction is confined to the indicated interval of proton emission angles .",
    "the main result of this work includes general expressions ( appendix  [ appa ] ) that allow the cross - sections and the analyzing powers of the inclusive polarized - deuteron stripping reaction to be calculated .",
    "the formulas were obtained in the diffraction approximation by analytically integrating the expression for the corresponding density matrix .",
    "this approach can also be applied in other similar problems with multiple integrals if the integrand allows an expansion in a series of gaussoid basis functions .    with the help of tabulated data for the densities of target nuclei and making use of a realistic deuteron wave function with a correct asymptotic at large nucleon - nucleon distances ,",
    "the observed angular dependences of the cross - sections and analyzing powers for the @xmath0 reaction were described in the case of @xmath54 and @xmath82 nuclei and a deuteron energy of 56  mev .",
    "a single fitting parameter was used at that , namely , the normalization parameter for the imaginary part of the high - energy double folding potential .",
    "it should be noticed that the general formulas obtained in this work can be used to describe the cross - sections and polarizations not only for the inclusive processes of deuteron stripping , but also deuteron , as well as light- and heavy - ion , breakup  @xcite .",
    "both the angular and energy distributions of indicated quantities can be calculated . in the latter case",
    ", expressions for @xmath83 and @xmath84 in ( [ eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq11 ] ) should be integrated over the normal components of the emitted particle momentum .",
    "in this appendix , the calculation results are presented for the traces of the matrices in the numerator and denominator of expression ( [ eq2 ] ) after analytical integration in ( [ eq3 ] ) with functions ( [ eq6 ] ) and ( [ eq7 ] ) .",
    "the numerator in ( [ eq2 ] ) looks like @xmath85 here , @xmath37 is the transverse component of emitted particle momentum @xmath86 , and the quantity @xmath49 is defined as follows : @xmath87 where @xmath88 @xmath89 @xmath90    the denominator in ( [ eq2 ] ) is determined by the formula @xmath91 where @xmath92    @xmath93    @xmath94    @xmath95    @xmath96    @xmath97    @xmath98    @xmath99    the values in right sides of ( [ a4 ] ) , ( [ a5 ] ) , ( [ a9 ] ) , ( [ a10 ] ) , ( [ a13 ] ) , and ( [ a14 ] ) are defined as follows :    @xmath100    @xmath101    @xmath102    @xmath103    @xmath104    @xmath105    @xmath106    @xmath107    @xmath108    @xmath109    @xmath110    @xmath111    @xmath112    @xmath113    in ( [ a2 ] ) , ( [ a7 ] ) , and ( [ a11 ] ) , @xmath114 . the function @xmath115 in ( [ a3 ] ) , ( [ a8 ] ) , and ( [ a12 ] ) looks like @xmath116 besides , @xmath117",
