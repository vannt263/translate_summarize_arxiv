    "in this paper , we devise superconvergent @xmath0-conforming hdg method for the following brinkman equations :    [ nb ] @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the velocity gradient , @xmath4 is the velocity , @xmath5 is the pressure , @xmath6 is the effective viscosity constant , @xmath7 is inverse of the permeability tensor , and @xmath8 is the external body force . the domain @xmath9 is a polygon @xmath10 or polyhedron @xmath11 .",
    "one challenging aspect of numerical discretization of the brinkman equations is the construction of stable finite element methods in both stokes - dominated and darcy - dominated regimes .",
    "we refer to such methods as uniformly stable methods .    in 2002 , mardal et .",
    "al . @xcite",
    "numerically show that the well - known lowest - order stable elements for stokes problem ( @xmath12 element @xcite , crouzeix - raviart element @xcite , and mini element @xcite ) fail to converge in the darcy - dominated regime ; and the lowest - order raviart - thomas element @xcite fails to converge in the stokes - dominated regime .",
    "the authors then proposed a uniformly stable lowest - order nonconforming finite element ( tangential conformity of velocity is enforced weakly ) that approximate pressure with piecewise constants and velocity with lowest - order brezzi - douglas - marini space @xcite enriched with three cubic divergence - free bubble functions in two - space dimensions .",
    "three - dimensional extension of their element was later given in @xcite by tai and winther in 2006 .    in 2008 , xie et .",
    "@xcite presented three approaches to obtain uniformly stable finite element methods for the darcy - stokes interface problems .",
    "first , the authors prove in ( * ? ? ? * theorem 3.1 ) that an existing _ conforming _ stokes element ( stable in the stokes - dominated regime ) is uniformly stable if and only if _",
    "discretely divergence - free velocity implies almost everywhere divergence - free one_. an example of such element is the scott - vogelius element @xcite @xmath13 for @xmath14 on _ singular - vertex free mesh_. second , several lowest - order modified @xmath0 elements , including the ones proposed in @xcite , are presented on triangular and tetrahedral meshes . finally , the authors proposed a consistent modification of the weak form by adding the term @xmath15 into the bilinear form and modifying the corresponding linear form respectively . such modification , inspired by the technique used in mixed form of poisson equation @xcite , render any pair of stable stokes elements uniformly stable .",
    "among these three approaches , the authors favored the modified @xmath0 elements due to their exact sequence property which is import for designing efficient linear system solvers .",
    "two stabilized finite elements are introduced and analyzed in @xcite by badia and codina in 2009 , a generalized mini element and a stabilized element are introduced and analyzed in @xcite by juntunen and stenberg in 2010 , whose numerical study was then documented in @xcite by hannukainen et .",
    "al . in 2011 .",
    "high - order generalization of the modified @xmath0 elements @xcite in two- and three - space dimensions was presented in @xcite by guzmn and neilan in 2012 . in 2011 , konno and stenberg @xcite introduced high - order @xmath0-conforming elements combined with nitsche s ( penalty ) method for tangential continuity of the velocity field to discrete the brinkman equations .",
    "optimal energy norm velocity estimates , independent of pressure regularity , were proven in @xcite .",
    "efficient and reliable a posterior error estimates were also presented in @xcite .",
    "a hybridized variation of the method @xcite was presented in @xcite by the same authors in 2012 , resulting a saddle - point system with global degrees of freedom consists of the tangential velocity and a scalar variable per facet .    in 2014 ,",
    "vassilevski and villa @xcite discretized the brinkman equations with a mixed formulation that approximate the ( scaled ) vorticity , velocity and pressure with @xmath16-conforming , @xmath0-conforming , and @xmath1 spaces , respectively , that form parts of a discrete de rham complex .",
    "such method was proven to be optimal convergent in an energy norm for a special type of boundary conditions .",
    "@xmath0-conforming velocity fields was also used to approximate incompressible navier - stokes flow in the dg literature . in 2005 ,",
    "cockburn et .",
    "@xcite proposed an energy - stable @xmath0-conforming ldg method for the incompressible navier - stokes equations ; later in 2007 , the same authors study more carefully on @xmath0-conforming dg methods in @xcite . in 2010 , lehrenfeld hybridized , in his diploma thesis @xcite , the ( symmetric ) interior penalty dg formulation in @xcite of the stokes flow , resulting an exactly divergence - free hybrid dg method ; see also the 2016 paper by lehrenfeld and schberl @xcite , where a projected jump approach was also used to further decrease computational cost while maintain same convergence rates .",
    "this method , applied to brinkman equations , is equivalent to the hybridized method proposed in @xcite .",
    "finally , in 2014 , cockburn and sayas @xcite introduced a parameter - free superconvergent @xmath0-conforming hdg method for the stokes flow based on a velocity gradient - velocity - pressure formulation .",
    "all the above mentioned @xmath0-conforming ( h)dg methods provide pressure - robust velocity error estimates . for a discussion of the importance of pressure - robust numerical schemes , see the 2016 preprint by linke and merdon @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the parameter - free hdg method in @xcite to the brinkman equations in two ways .",
    "first , we enrich the finite element spaces on simplicial meshes such that the velocity space is taken to be the raviart - thomas space as opposite to the brezzi - douglas - marini space used in @xcite .",
    "this way , the divergence of velocity space is equal to the pressure space on each element .",
    "such modification render the method stable in the darcy - dominated regime and provides a more accurate approximation to the divergence of the numerical velocity ( when the velocity is not divergence - free ) . recall that the analysis in @xcite , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.1 ) , require the divergence - free condition @xmath17 to holds true , which is not necessary for our method .",
    "second , we present a novel parameter - free @xmath0-conforming hdg method on rectangular meshes .",
    "both methods are defined for each nonnegative integer @xmath18 , resulting a global linear system with degrees of freedom @xmath19 per facet .",
    "both methods provide optimal @xmath1-estimates in all the variables , and ( pressure - robust ) superconvergent @xmath1-estimates for certain projection of velocity error ( with a regularity assumption on the dual problem ) .",
    "this superconvergence property is not shared by numerical methods based on velocity - pressure formulations .",
    "we specifically remark that our error analysis , which is quite different and more straightforward than that in @xcite for the stokes flow , is based on a so - called discrete @xmath20-stability result shared by the particular choices of the finite element spaces ; see @xcite .",
    "we also remark that our proposed parameter - free @xmath0-conforming hdg method can be easily applied to the incompressible navier - stokes equations with an upwinding flux choice ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) for the nonlinear convection term , resulting an energy - stable superconvergent hdg method ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the parameter - free @xmath0-conforming hdg method and give the main results on a priori error estimates . in section 3 ,",
    "we prove our main results in section 2 . in section 4",
    ", we discuss the hybridization of the @xmath0-conforming hdg method . in section 5 ,",
    "we provide preliminary two - dimensional numerical experiments on triangular and rectangular meshes to validate our theoretical results .",
    "we end in section 6 with some concluding remarks .",
    "in this section , we first introduce the notation that will be used throughout the paper , and then present the finite element spaces that define the @xmath0-conforming hdg methods .",
    "we conclude with an a priori error estimates along with a key inequality that we call _ discrete @xmath20-stability_.      we denote by @xmath21 ( the mesh ) a shape - regular conforming triangulation of the domain @xmath22 into _ affine - mapped",
