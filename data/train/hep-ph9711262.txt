    "the corresponding decay amplitudes can be expressed as @xmath10,\\label{ampl - neut}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 , @xmath12 denote qcd penguin amplitudes , @xmath13 , @xmath14 correspond to `` colour - suppressed '' electroweak penguin contributions , @xmath15 is due to annihilation processes , and @xmath16 is usually referred to as a `` colour - allowed '' @xmath17 `` tree '' amplitude .",
    "the label @xmath18 reminds us that we are dealing with @xmath19 modes , the minus sign in ( [ ampl - neut ] ) is due to our definition of meson states , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the up- and down - type quark charges , respectively .    the cleo collaboration has recently reported the first results for the combined , i.e.  averaged over decay and charge - conjugate , branching ratios @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "these quantities may lead to interesting constraints on the ckm angle @xmath0 , if their ratio @xmath24 is found experimentally to be smaller than 1 @xcite .",
    "since the present cleo data give @xmath25 , this may indeed be the case .",
    "the bounds on @xmath0 obtained in this manner turn out to be complementary to the present range for this angle arising from the usual fits of the unitarity triangle ( for a review , see for instance @xcite ) , and are hence of particular phenomenological interest .",
    "a detailed analysis of the implications of these bounds for the determination of the unitarity triangle has been performed in @xcite .",
    "an important limitation of the theoretical accuracy of the `` nave '' bounds on @xmath0 derived in @xcite  besides the `` colour - suppressed '' electroweak penguin contributions  is due to rescattering processes of the kind @xmath26 , which have received a lot of attention in the recent literature @xcite@xcite ( for earlier references , see @xcite ) . in this paper",
    ", we focus on these rescattering effects . following closely @xcite ,",
    "we show in section  [ pen - zoo ] that they are related to penguin topologies with internal up quark exchanges .",
    "analogously , rescattering processes such as @xmath27 can be regarded as long - distance contributions to penguins with internal charm quarks , which also received considerable interest in the recent literature  @xcite@xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we discuss the penguin topologies in general terms . in particular , we establish the relation between the penguin diagram pictures used by cp practitioners and the formal operator method .",
    "here we also recall useful expressions for the @xmath19 and @xmath28 penguin amplitudes . in section  [ pen - zoo ]",
    ", we derive a simple isospin relation between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 decay amplitudes by defining the `` tree '' and `` penguin '' amplitudes in a proper way , and address the question of rescattering effects in penguin - induced @xmath9 decays .",
    "these isospin relations play a key role to probe @xmath0 and allow the derivation of generalized bounds on this ckm angle . in section  [ pen - hunt ] , we point out that decays of the type @xmath7 play an important role to obtain insights into rescattering processes and the dynamics of penguin topologies . using their combined branching ratios and br@xmath29 , interesting relations and bounds",
    "can be derived , including a relation between the direct cp - violating asymmetries arising in these modes .",
    "moreover , it is even possible to take into account the rescattering effects _ completely _ in the generalized bounds on @xmath0 by following these lines .",
    "after a brief look at the impact of new - physics contributions to @xmath30@xmath31 mixing in section  [ new - phys ] , we collect our conclusions in section  [ concl ] .",
    "technical details related to the isospin structure of the relevant amplitudes are relegated to an appendix .",
    "in many phenomenological analyses of @xmath9 decays in the literature , it is customary to represent penguin contributions by penguin diagrams with explicit @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 exchanges , as shown in fig .  1 ( a ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the proper treatment of @xmath9 decays at scales @xmath36 is an effective five - quark field theory , which deals with local operators . here",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 do not appear explicitly as dynamical fields and the local operators are built out of lighter flavours only .",
    "the effects of @xmath32 and @xmath33 are present only in the short - distance wilson coefficients of these operators .",
    "the purpose of this section is to clarify the relation between these two approaches to describe @xmath9 decays and in particular to state explicitly what is meant by the @xmath19 penguin amplitude in ( [ ampl - char ] ) , and similarly by the @xmath28 penguin amplitude contributing to the decay @xmath37 , which will play an important role in section  [ pen - hunt ] . to this end , let us recall the effective hamiltonian for @xmath38 decays by concentrating on the @xmath39 penguin transitions .",
    "the @xmath40 case can be analysed in the same manner with the obvious replacement @xmath41 in the formulae given below .",

    "we do not show the electroweak penguin operators , which can be found for instance in @xcite .",
    "a discussion similar to the one presented below can also be made for the latter operators @xcite .",
    "since quark charges enter in the electroweak penguin operators , they exhibit , however , a different isospin structure as the qcd penguin operators .    the explicit derivation of ( [ heff ] ) can be found in an appendix of @xcite .",
    "it involves in particular the matching of the full six - quark theory containing @xmath32 with the effective theory , in which @xmath32 and the top quark do not appear as dynamical fields : the operators @xmath52 do not involve the top quark and are built out of @xmath35 , @xmath34 , @xmath54 , @xmath18 and @xmath55 quarks only .",
    "= 4.5 cm    let us now see how the penguin diagrams with internal @xmath56 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 exchanges , in fig .  1 ( a ) , are represented in the effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) .",
    "the effect of the penguin diagrams with internal @xmath56 and top quark exchanges is obviously represented by the last term : the coefficients @xmath57 depend on @xmath58 , and this dependence is represented by the well - known inami ",
    "lim function @xmath59 @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", there is no trace in ( [ heff ] ) of the penguin diagrams with internal @xmath56 , @xmath35 and @xmath34 exchanges . in particular",
    ", the coefficients @xmath60 do not carry any information on these penguin topologies .",
    "indeed , as explicitly demonstrated in @xcite , the penguin diagrams with internal @xmath35 and @xmath34 quarks and with the @xmath61 propagator have been cancelled in the process of matching by similar diagrams , where the @xmath61 propagators have been replaced by local operators , as shown in fig .  1 ( b ) .",
    "strictly speaking , there remains a renormalization scheme dependent constant , which is added with the help of the unitarity of the ckm matrix to the function @xmath59 in @xmath57 .",
    "this constant is equal to @xmath62 in the ndr scheme , and vanishes in the hv scheme @xcite .",
    "a discussion of these features and applications to non - leptonic @xmath9 decays can also be found in @xcite .",
    "the fact that there is no trace of penguin diagrams with internal @xmath35 and @xmath34 quarks in ( [ heff ] ) is consistent with the general structure of the operator product expansion combined with renormalization group methods . at scales",
    "@xmath63 , the effect of quarks with @xmath64 is absent in the wilson coefficients and can only be found in the matrix elements of the operators @xmath52 .",
    "the @xmath19 qcd penguin amplitude @xmath11 contributing to @xmath5 can be decomposed as follows : @xmath65 analogously , the @xmath28 qcd penguin amplitude @xmath66 contributing to @xmath37 can be written as @xmath67 note that similar expressions hold also for the electroweak penguin amplitudes .",
    "the strong amplitudes @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) in ( [ ps ] ) and ( [ pd - def ] ) are related to each other by interchanging all @xmath54 and @xmath18 quarks , i.e.  through the so - called @xmath71 spin of the @xmath72 flavour symmetry of strong interactions .",
    "let us focus in the following discussion on the decay @xmath5",
    ". in the formal operator language presented above , the meaning of @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 is simply as follows : @xmath76\\ ] ] @xmath77 here @xmath78 and @xmath79 denote hadronic matrix elements with insertions of the current  current operators @xmath80 and @xmath81 into penguin diagrams with internal @xmath35 and @xmath34 quark exchanges .",
    "the importance of such diagrams in connection with certain strategies for ckm determinations has been pointed out for the first time in @xcite , although such contributions have been considered already a long time ago in a different context @xcite .",
    "recently the importance of @xmath82 , in particular in connection with the cleo data and the determination of the angle @xmath49 through the cp asymmetry in @xmath83 , has also been emphasized by the authors of @xcite , who have named them `` charming penguins '' .",
    "let us next observe that the matrix elements of the penguin operators @xmath84 do not carry the subscript p. indeed , what is meant by @xmath85 in the literature are hadronic matrix elements with insertions of the penguin operators not only into the penguin diagrams , but also into other topologies , in particular tree diagrams .    at this point",
    ", it should be stressed that the current  current operators @xmath86 and @xmath87 contribute to the mode @xmath5 only through the penguin topologies discussed above , and through annihilation topologies .",
    "the latter , which will be discussed in more detail in the following section , are described by the @xmath15 amplitude in ( [ ampl - char ] ) and are only due to the @xmath87 operators @xcite .",
    "such annihilation processes are absent in the case of @xmath88 .",
    "however , in contrast to @xmath5 , this decay receives also contributions from hadronic matrix elements of the @xmath87 operators with insertions into tree - diagram - like topologies , which are represented in ( [ ampl - neut ] ) by the amplitude @xmath16 .",
    "we hope that this discussion shows the relation between the formal operator method and the more phenomenological picture used by cp asymmetry practitioners .",
    "simultaneously , this discussion demonstrates that attributing the usual feynman diagrams with full @xmath61 propagators and internal @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 quarks to @xmath85 , @xmath89 and @xmath73 , respectively  although roughly correct  does not fully describe what happens at scales @xmath36 and may sometimes be confusing .",
    "let us next have a closer look at the general structure of the @xmath90 @xmath91 qcd penguin amplitudes @xmath11 and @xmath66 . employing the unitarity of the ckm matrix and making furthermore use of the wolfenstein parametrization @xcite",
    ", we arrive at @xmath92\\left|p_{tu}^{(s)}\\right|\\,e^{i\\delta_{tu}^{(s)}}\\ ] ] @xmath93 \\left|p_{tu}^{(d)}\\right|\\,e^{i\\delta_{tu}^{(d)}},\\ ] ] where the notation @xmath94 has been introduced , and @xmath95 describes the contributions of penguins with up and charm quarks running as virtual particles in the loops .",
    "the present status of the relevant ckm factors in ( [ bspenamp ] ) and ( [ bdpenamp ] ) is given by @xmath96 where @xmath97 .",
    "strategies to fix these parameters have recently been reviewed in @xcite .    at this point , it should be emphasized that whereas the @xmath98 amplitudes are @xmath43 and renormalization scheme independent , this is not the case for the different contributions in ( [ ps ] ) and ( [ pd - def ] ) .",
    "this is evident , if one inspects equations ( [ psu])([pst ] ) . to this end",
    ", one can simply evaluate the penguin - like matrix elements of @xmath51 in a perturbative framework to find that their @xmath43 dependences , related to the mixing between @xmath51 and the penguin operators , can not be cancelled by the @xmath43 dependence of @xmath99 .",
    "similarly , the non - logarithmic terms in these matrix elements are renormalization scheme dependent , and this scheme dependence can not be cancelled by the scheme dependence of @xmath99 . on the other hand , @xmath100 and @xmath101",
    "are @xmath43 independent and renormalization scheme independent , because these dependences cancel in ( [ q1q2 ] ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath101 is a physical quantity and can therefore be determined experimentally , as we will see in section  [ pen - hunt ] .",
    "formulae ( [ bspenamp ] ) and ( [ bdpenamp ] ) can already be found in the literature @xcite . in the case of the @xmath11 amplitude ( [ bspenamp ] ) ,",
    "we have kept terms of @xmath102 , which have been neglected in these papers , and also in the bound on the ckm angle @xmath0 derived in @xcite .",
    "the highly ckm - suppressed @xmath103 phase factor may lead to direct cp violation in the decay @xmath104 .",
    "model calculations performed at the perturbative quark level indicate that @xmath105 is not close to 1 , i.e.  that the large ckm suppression of the @xmath106 term in ( [ bspenamp ] ) is not compensated , and give cp asymmetries of at most a few percent @xcite .",
    "however , as was pointed out recently @xcite@xcite , rescattering effects of the kind @xmath107 may lead to cp asymmetries as large as @xmath108 , and represent an important limitation of the theoretical accuracy of the `` original '' bounds on @xmath0 arising from the @xmath1 and @xmath2 decays that were proposed in @xcite .",
    "let us have a closer look at these final - state interaction effects , which are closely related to penguin topologies , in the following section .",
    "as we have already noted , the decays @xmath5 , @xmath88 and their charge conjugates provide a fertile ground to probe the ckm angle @xmath0 @xcite@xcite . in this context ,",
    "one makes use of the @xmath4 isospin symmetry of strong interactions , which appears  in contrast to the @xmath72 flavour symmetry  to be a very good and safe working assumption .",
    "it allows us to relate the qcd penguin amplitudes contributing to @xmath5 and @xmath88 to each other , yielding the following relations : @xmath109\\label{ampl - neutiso}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath110 decay amplitude _ defines _ the @xmath19 `` penguin '' amplitude @xmath111 , the quantity @xmath112 is due to `` colour - suppressed '' electroweak penguins , and the generalized `` colour - allowed '' @xmath17 `` tree '' amplitude takes the form @xmath113 where @xmath114 is a cp - conserving strong phase . in order to express ( [ ampl - char ] ) and ( [ ampl - neut ] ) as in ( [ ampl - chariso ] ) and ( [ ampl - neutiso ] ) with the help of the @xmath4 isospin symmetry",
    ", special care has to be taken .",
    "in particular , the `` tree '' amplitude @xmath115 has to be defined in a proper way .",
    "the point is that an application of the isospin symmetry requires that we replace all @xmath35 and @xmath54 quarks in the @xmath5 decay processes by @xmath54 and @xmath35 quarks , respectively , in order to relate them to those of the transition @xmath88 . while such a replacement is straightforward in the case of @xmath116=p_c^{(s)}\\ ] ]",
    "@xmath117 at first sight a problem shows up in the case of @xmath118 can be obtained easily from ( [ o1u ] ) by substituting @xmath35 through @xmath54 quarks .",
    "consequently , isospin does not imply that @xmath73 is equal to @xmath119 .",
    "the difference between these amplitudes can , however , be absorbed in the proper definition of the @xmath115 amplitude in ( [ ampl - neutiso ] ) .",

    "the second term in ( [ ts - def ] ) , which is required by this isospin decomposition , shows that @xmath115 is not only given by hadronic matrix elements with insertions of the @xmath80 current  current operators into tree - diagram - like topologies , as navely expected .",
    "the @xmath121 operators contribute both through insertions into penguin topologies and through annihilation processes .",
    "the latter correspond to the annihilation amplitude @xmath15 appearing in ( [ ampl - char ] ) .",
    "consequently , the term in curly brackets in ( [ ts - def ] ) consists both of the difference of contributions from penguin topologies with internal up and down quarks , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pen - diff ] , and of contributions from annihilation topologies .",
    "= 4.5truecm = 4.5truecm    in order to address the question of rescattering effects in @xmath122 decays , let us first return to the expressions given in ( [ bspenamp ] ) and ( [ bdpenamp ] ) .",
    "these formulae are completely general . in several previous analyses of penguin - induced @xmath9 decays ,",
    "it was , however , assumed that penguin processes are dominated by internal top quark exchanges , corresponding to @xmath123 .",
    "an important implication of this special case would be that the @xmath66 penguin amplitude is proportional to the phase factor @xmath124 , i.e.  exhibits a very simple phase structure .",
    "as was pointed out in @xcite , this feature is spoiled by penguin contributions with internal up and charm quarks , leading to sizeable values of @xmath125 .",
    "since the @xmath106 factor in ( [ bspenamp ] ) is highly ckm - suppressed by @xmath126 , there is to a good approximation no non - trivial cp - violating phase present in the @xmath19 penguin amplitude , provided the relation @xmath127 is fulfilled .",
    "model calculations performed at the perturbative quark - level to estimate the penguin amplitudes @xmath68 ( @xmath70 ) indicate that this requirement is indeed satisfied , i.e.  that the very large ckm suppression of the cp - violating phase factor in ( [ bspenamp ] ) is not compensated , and that there is direct cp violation in @xmath1 of at most a few percent @xcite .",
    "the qcd penguin amplitudes @xmath128 receive , however , also long - distance contributions from rescattering processes , which can be divided into two categories and are not included in these simple model calculations .",
    "let us discuss these effects by focusing on the channel @xmath5 .",
    "in the first class of rescattering processes , we have to deal with decays such as @xmath129 , which are caused by the @xmath130 current  current operators through insertions into tree - diagram - like topologies , and may rescatter into the final state @xmath131 , i.e.  we have @xmath132 where @xmath133 . here",

    "[ fig : pen - u ] , these final - state interaction effects are related to penguin topologies with internal up quarks and appear in ( [ bspenamp ] ) as long - distance contributions to the @xmath73 amplitude .",

    "usually it is assumed that annihilation processes are suppressed relative to tree - diagram - like processes by a factor of @xmath137 .",
    "however , this feature may no longer hold in the presence of rescattering effects @xcite , so that annihilation topologies may play a more important role than navely expected . model calculations @xcite based on regge phenomenology typically give an enhancement of the ratio @xmath138 from @xmath139 to @xmath140 .",
    "rescattering processes of this kind can be probed , e.g.  by the @xmath141=0 decay @xmath142 . a future stringent bound on br@xmath143 at the level of @xmath144 or lower",

    "although the `` factorization '' hypothesis @xcite is in general questionable , it may work reasonably well for the colour - allowed amplitude @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "since the intrinsic `` strength '' of decays such as @xmath154 , representing the `` first step '' of the rescattering processes ( [ u - rescatter ] ) , is given by @xmath16 , we may derive a `` plausible '' upper bound @xmath155 , where the recent cleo data on the combined @xmath1 branching ratio @xcite , and the bsw form factors @xcite have been used to evaluate @xmath16 within `` factorization '' ( see @xcite ) . note that the ratio @xmath156 is typically one order of magnitude smaller , if rescattering processes do not play the dominant role in @xmath104 .    in the following discussion we will not comment further on quantitative estimates of rescattering effects .",
    "a reliable theoretical treatment is very difficult and requires knowledge of the dynamics of strong interactions that is unfortunately not available at present .",
    "we rather advocate to use additional experimental information to obtain insights into final - state interactions . before turning to such strategies in section  [ pen - hunt ] , let us first point out an interesting feature of the rescattering processes .",
    "the ratio @xmath157 of the combined @xmath122 branching ratios introduced in ( [ def - r ] ) does not only imply constraints on the ckm angle @xmath0 , but also on the magnitude of the `` tree '' amplitude @xmath115 .",

    "consequently , if the rescattering effects characterized by ( [ u - rescatter ] ) and related to such topologies play in fact an important role , the value of @xmath159 could in principle be shifted significantly from its `` factorized '' value . in particular",

    "decays discussed above , the observables that will be available first are probably the combined branching ratios @xmath184\\\\ \\mbox{br}(b^\\pm\\to k^\\pm k)&\\equiv&\\frac{1}{2}\\left[\\mbox{br}(b^+\\to   k^+\\overline{k^0})+\\mbox{br}(b^-\\to k^-k^0)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at present , only the bounds br@xmath185 and br@xmath186 are available from the cleo collaboration , while the combined @xmath1 branching ratio @xmath187 \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\left(2.3^{+1.1}_{-1.0}\\pm0.3\\pm0.2\\right)\\times 10^{-5}\\label{br - com}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] has already been measured @xcite .    in order to obtain insights into the dynamics of penguin and final - state interaction processes , the ratio latexmath:[\\ ] ] comparing ( [ char - decom ] ) with ( [ ps ] ) , it is easy to read off the isospin decompositions of @xmath273 , @xmath89 and @xmath85 , while @xmath274 has to be defined by @xmath275 in order to get the isospin relations ( [ ampl - chariso ] ) and ( [ ampl - neutiso ] ) , which are at the basis of the bounds on @xmath0 derived in @xcite .",
    "this discussion shows nicely that these relations can be derived by using only isospin arguments , i.e.  even without using the terminology of `` penguin '' and `` tree '' contributions as is usually done by cp practitioners .",
    "let us finally note that ( [ psu])([pst ] ) and ( [ ts - def ] ) , which are expressed in terms of hadronic matrix elements of four - quark operators , can be obtained easily from ( [ char - decom])([ts - decom ] ) by taking into account that ( [ d1 ] ) and ( [ d2 ] ) yield @xmath276 and using moreover ( [ hu - def])([hp - def ] ) .",
