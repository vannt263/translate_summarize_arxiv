    "quantum entanglement represents one of the corner stones of the quantum mechanics theory and is of fundamental interest in modern physics @xcite . in the early days of the theory , the notion of entanglement was first noted and introduced by einstein , podolsky , and rosen as a paradox in the formalism of the quantum theory @xcite . nowadays entanglement is treated as a well - established concept and experimentally verified phenomenon in modern physics .",
    "quantum entanglement is a nonlocal correlation between two ( or more ) quantum systems such that the description of their states has to be done with reference to each other even if they are spatially well separated . understanding and quantifying entanglement",
    "may provide an answer for many questions regarding the behavior of complex quantum systems .",
    "particularly , entanglement is considered as the physical property responsible for the long - range quantum correlations accompanying a quantum phase transition in many - body systems at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "particular fields where entanglement plays a crucial role are quantum teleportation , quantum cryptography , and quantum computing , where it is considered as the physical basis for manipulating linear superpositions of quantum states to implement the different proposed quantum computing algorithms @xcite .",
    "different physical systems have been proposed as reliable candidates for the underlying technology of quantum computing and quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "the basic idea in each one of these systems is to define certain quantum degree of freedom to serve as a qubit , such as the charge , orbital , or spin angular momentum .",
    "this is usually followed by finding a controllable mechanism to form an entanglement between a two - qubit system in such a way to produce a fundamental quantum computing gate such as an exclusive boolean @xmath8 .",
    "in addition , we have to be able to coherently manipulate such an entangled state to provide an efficient computational process .",
    "such coherent manipulation of entangled states has been observed in different systems such as isolated trapped ions @xcite and superconducting junctions @xcite .",
    "the coherent control of a two - electron spin state in a coupled quantum dot was achieved experimentally , in which the coupling mechanism is the heisenberg exchange interaction between the electron spins @xcite .    the obvious demand for a controllable mechanism led to one of the most interesting proposals in that regard which is to introduce a time - dependent exchange interaction between the two valence spins on a doubled quantum dot system as the coupling mechanism @xcite .",
    "the coupling can be pulsed over definite intervals resulting a swap gate which can be achieved by raising and lowering the potential barrier between the two dots through controllable gate voltage .",
    "the ground state of the two - coupled electrons is a spin singlet , which is a highly entangled spin state .",
    "the interacting heisenberg spin chain model represents a very reliable model for constructing quantum computing schemes in different solid state systems and a very rich model for studying the novel physics of localized spin systems .",
    "this spin chain can be experimentally realized , for instance , as a one - dimensional chain of coupled nano quantum dots .",
    "there has been many studies focusing on the entanglement at zero and finite temperature for isotropic and anisotropic heisenberg spin chains in presence and absence of an external magnetic field @xcite .",
    "particularly , the dynamics of thermal entanglement has been studied in an @xmath0 spin chain considering a constant nearest - neighbor exchange interaction , in the presence of a time - varying magnetic field represented by a step , exponential , and sinusoidal functions of time @xcite .",
    "recently , the dynamics of entanglement in a one - dimensional ising spin chain at zero temperature was investigated numerically where the number of spins was seven at most @xcite .",
    "the generation and transportation of the entanglement through the chain under the effect of an external magnetic field and irradiated by a weak resonant field were studied .",
    "it was shown that the remote entanglement between the spins is generated and transported although only nearest - neighbor coupling was considered .",
    "later , the anisotropic @xmath0 model for a small number of spins , with a time - dependent nearest - neighbor coupling at zero temperature was studied , too @xcite .",
    "the time - dependent spin - spin coupling was represented by a dc part and a sinusoidal ac part .",
    "it was found that there is an entanglement resonance through the chain whenever the ac coupling frequency matches the zeeman splitting .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate the evolution of quantum entanglement in an infinite one - dimensional @xmath0 spin chain system coupled through nearest - neighbor interaction under the effect of a time - varying magnetic field @xmath2 at zero and finite temperature .",
    "we consider a time - dependent nearest - neighbor heisenberg coupling @xmath1 between the spins on the chain . we discuss a general solution for the problem for any time dependence form of the coupling and magnetic field and present an exact solution for a particular case of practical interest , namely a step function form for both the coupling and the magnetic field .",
    "we focus on the dynamics of entanglement between any two spins in the chain and its asymptotic behavior under the interplay of the time - dependent coupling and magnetic field .",
    "moreover , we investigate the persistence of quantum effects in the system as it evolves in time and as its temperature increases .",
    "we show that the time evolution and asymptotic behavior of entanglement for static coupling and magnetic field at zero temperature depends only the ratio of the coupling to the magnetic field rather than their individual values but not at finite temperatures .",
    "the entanglement was found to be very sensitive to the initial values of the coupling and the magnetic field and in particular cases they may dictate the asymptotic entanglement regardless of the final values of the parameters . the quantum effects were shown to dominate within certain regions of the temperature , coupling , and magnetic field space which depend significantly on the degree of anisotropy of the coupling which are manifested by the asymptotic behavior of entanglement .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present our model and discuss a general solution for the the @xmath0 spin chain for a general form of the coupling and magnetic field and focus on a particular case where the system is exactly solvable . in sec .",
    "iii we evaluate the magnetization and the spin - spin correlation functions of the system and use them to evaluate the entanglement . in secs .",
    "iv , v , and vi we study the entanglement dynamics in the completely anisotropic , partially anisotropic , and isotropic cases of the system respectively . we conclude in sec .",
    "vii and discuss future directions .",
    "in this section , we present an exact solution for the @xmath0 model of a one - dimensional lattice with @xmath9 sites in a time - dependent external magnetic field @xmath2 .",
    "we consider a time - dependent coupling @xmath1 between the nearest - neighbor spins on the chain .",

    "<S> we consider an infinite one - dimensional anisotropic @xmath0 spin chain with a nearest - neighbor time - dependent heisenberg coupling @xmath1 between the spins in presence of a time - dependent magnetic field @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss a general solution for the system and present an exact solution for particular choice of @xmath3 and @xmath4 of practical interest . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the dynamics of entanglement for different degrees of anisotropy of the system and at both zero and finite temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the time evolution of entanglement in the system shows non - ergodic and critical behavior at zero and finite temperatures and different degrees of anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic behavior of entanglement at the infinite time limit at zero temperature and constant @xmath3 and @xmath4 depends only the parameter @xmath5 rather than the individual values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 for all degrees of anisotropy but changes for nonzero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the asymptotic behavior is very sensitive to the initial values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 and for particular choices we may create finite asymptotic entanglement regardless of the final values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 . the persistence of quantum effects in the system as it evolves and as the temperature is raised is studied by monitoring the entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the quantum effects dominate within certain regions of the @xmath6-@xmath7 space that vary significantly depending on the degree of the anisotropy of the system . </S>",
    "<S> particularly , the quantum effects in the ising model case persist in the vicinity of both its critical phase transition point and zero temperature as it evolves in time . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the interplay between the different system parameters to tune and control the entanglement evolution is explored . </S>"
