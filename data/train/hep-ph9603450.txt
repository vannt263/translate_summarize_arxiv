    "even at these extremely low values of @xmath4 , the effect of the resummed anomalous dimensions stays at the level of 1% or below , and is still dominated entirely by the first two @xmath12 terms beyond nlo .    in the polarized case we consider the corresponding difference @xmath123 this case is practically much more interesting , firstly since  unlike in the unpolarized case ",
    "the non - singlet distributions are not a priori suppressed here with respect to the singlet ones at very low @xmath4 , and secondly since the shapes of the polarized initial distributions are not yet well established .",
    "we illustrate the strong dependence of the resummation effects on the latter quantities by choosing two partly rather different input sets for @xmath124 and @xmath125 . at first ,",

    "for this no proof exists yet , however , we have verified this behaviour up to 2loop order in section  3 for the coefficient functions of @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath138 .",
    "one should recall that the main resummation effect comes from that and the next order . under this assumption fermion number conservation",

    "we subtract a corresponding term @xmath140 from the kernels @xmath141 derived from ( [ eqgaa ] ) , in each order in @xmath97 . in @xmath5space",
    "this prescription ( denoted by ` a ' below ) leads to @xmath142 another possibility is the restoration of fermion number conservation by subleading @xmath143 pole terms .",
    "an especially simple choice ( denoted by ` b ' in the following ) is to modify @xmath144 according to @xmath145 besides these two prescriptions , which are analogous to the procedure in the second reference in  @xcite with respect to energy  momentum conservation in the unpolarized singlet case , we will also show the results for two other assumptions , namely ( ` c ' ) @xmath146 and ( ` d ' ) @xmath147 clearly , the results of the resummed calculation are only trustworthy , and this approach is to be preferred over a fixed order calculation , if the difference of the results obtained by all these procedures is small .",
    "the corresponding results are presented in figure 2 . for the relatively flat cw input @xcite , the effect is up to about 15% at @xmath148 . however , in the kinematical range accessible for polarized electron and proton scattering at hera  @xcite it again again amounts to about 1% or less .",
    "note , moreover , the wide spread of the results in dependence of the employed fermion - number conservation prescription .",
    "obviously the resummed contributions do not sufficiently dominate with respect to subleading terms at any foreseeable energy . for the steep grsv input @xcite , the effect is of approximately the same marginal size as in the unpolarized case considered above . in figure  2",
    "relative corrections are shown .",
    "recall that the absolute values for @xmath149 obtained in the different parametrizations extrapolating from the range @xmath150 of the current data down to smaller @xmath4 values vary strongly  @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the resummation of terms of order @xmath151 , derived in ref .",
    "@xcite for the qcd case , on the small-@xmath4 behaviour of non  singlet functions in qed and qcd .",
    "the comparison with the corresponding contributions obtained in the same order by complete nlo calculations shows the equivalence of both approaches in this limit up to order @xmath152 in both qed and qcd .",
    "since the coefficient functions up to two  loop order for the non  singlet combinations considered contain only terms less singular in @xmath153 in the @xmath154 scheme , the contributions @xmath155 in the three  loop @xmath156 splitting functions @xmath29 have been predicted on the basis of this resummation",
    ".    a numerical analysis has been performed for the qcd case of deep - inelastic ( polarized ) lepton scattering both off unpolarized and polarized targets .",
    "it turns out that the all  order resummation of the terms @xmath157 leads only to corrections on the level of @xmath158 in the unpolarized case of @xmath159 even down to extremely small @xmath4 values , @xmath160 .",
    "the corrections can be larger in the polarized case , up to about @xmath161 at @xmath162 , depending on the presently not yet well established small-@xmath4 behaviour of the polarized parton densities . in any case , the resummation effects are on the level of 1% in the kinematical range accessible experimentally at present or in the foreseeable future .",
    "presently unknown terms which are suppressed by powers of @xmath153 in the splitting functions do contribute in a potentially significant way to the evolution even at the lowest @xmath4-values considered .",
    "this has been demonstrated for the `  ' combination @xmath163 by applying several prescriptions to implement fermion number conservation into the resummed evolution equations .",
    "moreover , the resummation corrections are dominated by the first two terms in an @xmath12 expansion beyond nlo .",
    "all this indicates that fixed - order perturbation theory remains the appropriate theoretical framework for the evolution of non - singlet structure functions even at very small @xmath4 .",
