    "fast and accurate localizations of gamma - ray bursts by _",
    "beppo_sax helped to establish the connection of grb with the sources of decaying x - ray , optical , and radio emission ( e.g. costa  1997 , van paradijs   1997 , frail  1997 ) .",
    "x - ray afterglows were found in 15 of 19 well - localized bursts ; in most cases , the x - ray flux decayed as a power law of time , @xmath9 , with @xmath10 ranging from @xmath11 ( grb  970508 , piro  1998 ) to @xmath12 ( grb  970402 , nicastro  1998 ) .",
    "the power law decay of flux also is observed in the optical ( e.g. wijers  1997 , sokolov  1998 ) .",
    "this is a characteristic prediction of the relativistic fireball model of grb ( mszros , rees  1993 , mszros   1997 , waxman  1997 , sari  1998 ) .",
    "indeed , the energy release in some grb is enormous and sufficient to power the relativistic fireball ( kulkarni  1998 ) .",
    "the fireball observations immediately after the burst , when the temperature and density are at maximum , are of great interest .",
    "unfortunately , it has been impossible to observe the afterglows in the radio , optical , or x - rays earlier than approximately 10 hours after the burst .",
    "some earlier observations indicated that the afterglows could immediately follow some grb .",
    "there were detections of x - ray emission lasting for tens of seconds after the main burst was finished in gamma - rays ( sunyaev   1990 , murakami  1991 , terekhov  1993 , sazonov  1998 ) .",
    "pvo observatory observed a faint gamma - ray emission over @xmath13  s after the long , @xmath14s , burst grb  840304 ( klebesadel 1992 ) .",
    "the presence of slowly fading soft gamma - ray ( 100500  kev ) emission was found in about @xmath15 of bursts detected by granat / phebus ( tkachenko  1995 ) .",
    "hard gamma - ray photons ( 0.210  gev ) were detected during @xmath16 hours after grb  940217 by egret telescope ( hurley  1994 ) .",
    "we present here a detailed analysis of the grb  920723 light curve , which reveals a soft gamma - ray afterglow with flux decaying as a power law @xmath17 during at least 1000  s after the main burst .",
    "-37 mm    = 1 .",
    "sigma is the coded - mask telescope with a @xmath18 angular resolution operating in the 351300  kev energy band ( paul  1991 ) .",
    "typically , sigma performs uninterrupted 2030h observations , during which the telescope pointing is maintained with a @xmath19  accuracy ( but known to within @xmath20 ) .",
    "although the telescope field of view is only @xmath21 ( fwhm ) , some fraction of gamma - rays from sources closer than @xmath22 to the pointing direction reaches the detector through the gaps in the passive shield and produces arc - shaped images .",
    "this `` secondary optics '' ( or `` sidelobes '' ) was described in detail by claret  ( 1994a ) along with the appropriate analysis techniques .",
    "grb  920723 was observed by sigma through the secondary optics .",
    "an @xmath23 localization was obtained from this observation ( claret   1994b ) .",
    "grb  920723 is one of the brightest bursts observed by granat instruments and the brightest detected by sigma .",
    "the burst was triggered at @xmath24 ut and lasted for about 6  s. the watch all - sky monitor provided a @xmath25 localization ( sazonov 1998 ) and observed the fading x - ray emission in the 820  kev band during more than @xmath26  s after the main burst ( terekhov  1993 ) .",
    "phebus measured the peak burst flux @xmath27  erg  s@xmath28  @xmath29 and fluence @xmath30  erg  @xmath29 in the 100500  kev energy band ( terekhov  1995 ) .",
    "the sigma data allows the measurements of the burst light curve with better than @xmath31  s time resolution ( depending on flux ) during @xmath32  s after the trigger .",
    "in addition , the count rate in four wide energy bands ( 3570 , 70150 , 150300 , 300600  kev ) is recorded with the 4  s time resolution over the entire observation . with these data ,",
    "it is possibile to study the burst emission long after the trigger . below , we use only the first three energy channels , because the last one is plagued by low sensitivity .",
    "the peak burst count rate in the 35300  kev band was 7900  cnt  s@xmath28 , much higher than the average background rate 310  cnt  s@xmath28 .    during the observation of july 23 , 1992",
    ", sigma was pointed to her  x-1 .",
    "the pulsar was in eclipse and was not detected .",
    "the @xmath33 upper limit on its 3570  kev flux averaged over the observation , was @xmath34  cnt  s@xmath28 .",
    "the her  x-1 spectrum is known to be very soft ( the 20100  kev photon index is @xmath35 ) , and therefore its flux is negligible above 70  kev .",
    "the pulsar was in eclipse between 12000  s before the burst and 9000  s after the burst .",
    "therefore , it could not cause any significant variability of the sigma count rate during the reported observation .",
    "no other known bright sources were visible through either primary or secondary optics of the sigma telescope .",
    "granat operates on the high apogee orbit and , during the observation , was not influenced by the earth radiation belts or other magnetospheric anomalies ( such as the south atlantic anomaly ) . as a result ,",
    "the sigma background usually does not show any significant variations on the time scales shorter than @xmath36  s. therefore , it can be accurately modeled by a low degree polynomial .",
    "usually , sources contribute only a small fraction of the total sigma count rate . therefore , the correct background subtraction is vital for the source variability studies .",
    "we modeled the background using chebyshev polynomials .",
    "a complete description of the sigma background subtraction techniques is presented elsewhere ( burenin et al .",
    "1999 ) ; this analysis has shown that the background variations around the subtracted value in excess of poisson noise are smaller than 0.6 cnt  s@xmath28 on the 300  s time scale ( on the @xmath37 significance level ) .",
    "figure  1 shows the burst light curve in the 35300  kev band . there is a small peak in burst light curve just after the trigger . within the first second after the trigger",
    ", the burst flux rose rapidly . over the next five seconds",
    ", it remained at approximately the same level , showing a strong variability at all resolved time scales . at approximately 6  s after the trigger , the flux started to decline rapidly .",
    "-5 mm    =    -5 mm    -32 mm    =    -5 mm    =    -5pt    figure 2 shows the burst light curve in logarithmic coordinates of both time and flux .",
    "the shape of the light curve in these coordinates strongly depends on the choice of the reference time . in fig  2 ,",
    "the reference time is chosen at the moment of the burst trigger .",
    "there appears to be a power - law decay of flux starting at 1020  s after the trigger .",
    "this behavior is consistent with grb entering the stage of self - similar fireball expansion soon after the main burst .",
    "it should be emphasized that the self - similar behavior is expected only on time scales much larger than those of the main energy release .",
    "therefore , we used the data in the @xmath38@xmath39  s time interval for the power - law modeling of the light curve .    the solid line in fig .",
    "2 shows the power law fit in the time interval @xmath38@xmath39  s ; the dash - dotted line shows the exponential fit in the same interval .",
    "the reduced @xmath40 is 1.5 and 6.5 ( 4 dof ) for the power law and exponential models , respectively .",
    "the power law adequately describes the data and results in a better fit than the exponent .",
    "the best fit power law index is @xmath41 ( @xmath42 for the index @xmath43 ) .",
    "this power law tail contains at least @xmath44 of the main burst fluence . applying the same procedure to the three wide energy channels",
    "separately , we obtained the power law indices @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 in the 3570 , 70150 , and 150300  kev energy bands , respectively .",
    "interestingly , the extrapolation of the power law ( shown by the dotted line in the fig .",
    "3 ) points to the small peak near the beginning of the main burst ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the spectral evolution of the burst flux can be characterized by the ratio of the 820  kev flux measured by watch ( terekhov et al .",
    "1993 , sazonov et al . 1998 ) and the sigma flux in the 75200  kev band .",
    "standard sigma calibration does not apply to the secondary optics flux , so we used the phebus measurement of the main burst flux to find the conversion coefficient between sigma counts and flux .",
    "figure  3 shows the observed ratio of 820 and 75200  kev fluxes expressed in terms of equivalent spectral index in the 8200  kev energy range ( i.e. , the spectral index of an @xmath48 spectrum with the same hardness ratio as observed ) .",
    "the time behavior of @xmath7 indicates that the afterglow spectrum is significantly softer than that of the main burst . during the main burst ( in the 06  s time interval ) , the usual hard - to - soft evolution of the grb spectrum is observed ( e.g. ford  1995 ) . near the start of the gradual decline of the burst flux , 6  s after the trigger ( shown by the vertical dotted line in fig .  1 and 3 )",
    ", @xmath7 changes abruptly from @xmath49 to @xmath50 .",
    "it is interesting to examine the light curve with the reference time chosen at @xmath6s after the trigger because this moment can be singled out in both flux and spectral history of the burst ; the result is presented in fig .  4 .",
    "with this choice of zero time , the data in the 0.0120  s time interval lies on the extrapolation of the power law fit from the 201000  s time interval . adding these data to the fit results in the power law index @xmath51 .",
    "note that in this case , the power law flux decay is observed over approximately four orders of magnitude of time .",
    "we presented a high sensitivity observation of the grb  920723 light curve in the soft gamma - ray band .",
    "the stable background of sigma allows detection of the burst emission on the level of better than 1/1000 of the peak intensity .",
    "a similar analysis would be complicated with batse because the background is less stable and because the source is eclipsed by earth every several thousands seconds .",
    "we were able to detect the burst afterglow extending up to @xmath13  s after the main burst .",
    "there is a continuous transition of the main burst to its power law afterglow ( fig .  1 and 2 ) .",
    "the afterglow spectrum is significantly softer than that of the main burst .",
    "an abrupt change in the burst spectrum occurs at approximately the same moment when the power law decay of flux seems to start , at @xmath52s after the trigger .",
    "the behavior of grb afterglows in the lower energy bands and at @xmath53  s can be explained by the synchrotron emission of electrons accelerated in external shocks generated by relativistically expanding fireball colliding with the interstellar medium ( e.g. wijers  1997 , waxman  1997 , sari  1998 , wijers and galama  1998 ) . in the framework of this model ,",
    "the spectral flux at the observed frequency @xmath54 is given by @xmath55 , where @xmath7 and @xmath10 are constant and depend only on the spectral index of electrons on sufficiently late stages of the fireball evolution .",
    "for grb  920723 we obtain @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "both the spectrum and the light curve of grb  920723 seem to be considerably flatter than that of x - ray afterglows observed for other gamma - ray bursts at @xmath58 s  @xmath59@xmath60 and @xmath61@xmath62 ( e.g. , int zand  1998 , piro  1998 , nicastro  1998 ) .",
    "furthermore , the flux decay observed by sigma is flatter than @xmath63 ( at @xmath64% confidence ) , i.e.   the total flux diverges if extrapolated to @xmath65 .",
    "this suggests that the afterglow light curve should steepen at some moment during or after the sigma observation .    in the relativistic fireball model , the afterglow light curve and the energy spectrum",
    "should steepen simultaneously at the moment @xmath66 when the maximum in the electron spectrum , @xmath67 , passes through the sigma bandpass ( we assume below that @xmath66 corresponds to @xmath68kev ) . at later stages of the fireball evolution ,",
    "indices @xmath7 and @xmath10 do not change with time . since the light curve steepening after 1001000@xmath2s is required by our data at @xmath69 confidence , it can be suggested that @xmath70s .",
    "also , if indeed @xmath66 is @xmath71s , our flat spectrum may become consistent with the parameters of x - ray afterglows ( see above ) because the spectrum softens after @xmath66 . in the adiabatic fireball , @xmath66 can be estimated as @xmath72  s , where @xmath73ergs is the total energy release , and @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the fractions of the electron and magnetic field energy in the total shock energy , respectively ( sari et al .",
    "the value of @xmath66 not much less than @xmath76s would not be strongly inconsistent with the sigma data .",
    "however , using @xmath77 and @xmath78 estimates from the parameters of radio , optical , and x - ray afterglows of grb  970508 and grb  971214 at @xmath79s ( wijers & galama  1998 ) , we obtain @xmath80  s , which does seem to contradict our data at @xmath69 confidence level .",
    "this may indicate a large diversity of the fireball parameters in different bursts or some problems of a simple model of a spherically symmetric fireball in explaining the early stages of the gamma - ray burst afterglows .",
    "sigma data provides the first convincing observation of the power law afterglow in the soft gamma - rays and immediately after the burst . a very important",
    "issue is whether such afterglows are common .",
    "a preliminary analysis of other sigma bursts revealed no other convincing afterglows , primarily because of the faintness of other bursts ; on the basis of sigma data alone , we can not rule out that the soft gamma - ray afterglow is a common phenomenon .",
    "a preliminary analysis of the phebus data confirms the detection of the afterglow in grb  920723 and reveals a similar afterglow in grb  910402 ( tkachenko  1998 ) .",
    "the results of our systematic search for soft gamma - ray afterglows in the granat data will be presented in the future .",
