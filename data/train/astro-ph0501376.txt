    "@xcite ( bgp04 , hereandafter ) confirm the independence of most disk - bulge structural parameters with hubble type , but found that such photometric parameters of bulges and disks strongly correlate with bulge luminosity and with sersic index @xmath1 .",

    "+ in figure [ fig : parameters ] , the dependences of the bulge and disk photometric parameters on the mass of the final bulge are shown , this last parameter obtained from the simultaneous srsic - exponential fits performed to the surface density profiles of the remnants .",
    "supposing that the mass - to - light ratio @xmath34 is constant and very similar for real bulges @xcite , we have defined the bulge magnitude as @xmath35 , because the bulge total mass can be directly related to its luminosity through the constant @xmath34 .",
    "we have plotted ratios between the parameters of the final merger remnants and the corresponding to the initial galaxy vs.  the increment in the bulge magnitude ( i.e. , final minus initial magnitude ) .",
    "legend for symbols is the same as in figure [ fig : growth ] .",
    "notice that the strong proportional relations between photometric parameters and the bulge magnitude in our low - density models are weaker in the abp01 s dense models ( represented by empty diamonds in the figure ) ; trends as those exhibited by @xmath36 , @xmath37 , log(@xmath38 ) , log(@xmath0 ) and log(@xmath39 ) ( see panels ( c ) , ( f ) , ( g ) , ( i ) and ( k ) in the figure ) correspond to correlation coefficients greater than 0.96 when a lineal fit is performed ( you can see these values in col.6 from table [ tab : slopes ] ) .",
    "this means that low - density satellite accretion processes do not alter galaxies randomly : they give place to remnants whose properties are scaled between them , depending on the mass ratios and the orbit of the encounter . in adddition ,",
    "all the remnants have brighter bulges than initially .",
    "+ bgp04 gave mathematical expressions for the stronger relations , as follows : @xmath40    where @xmath41 represents a given photometric parameter ( as @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath4 , @xmath44 , @xmath1 ... ) , or the ratio between two of them ; @xmath45 is the k - band bulge magnitude ; and ( @xmath46 ) and ( @xmath47 ) are the slope and zero - point obtained from the orthogonal regression to the log(@xmath41)-@xmath45 relation .",
    "we have performed linear fits to the relations shown at figure [ fig : parameters ] , representing results by the dashed line in each case .",
    "therefore , if real bulges grow through satellite accretions , our slopes should be similar to those found by bgp04 , because our models are scalable and hence they can be displaced in the plane log(@xmath41)-@xmath48 .",
    "the constants needed for transforming from masses to luminosities and from a unit system to another do not affect the slopes in the relations , as they end as part of the additive term of the linear fit .",
    "+ in table [ tab : slopes ] , the slopes for all the strong correlations observed by bgp04 are compared to those obtained in our low - density models .",
    "it is encouraging that low - density models reproduce the observed tendencies in disk parameters , central velocity dispersions and @xmath0 ratios . the correlations which we fail to reproduce with our experiments are those involving the bulge effective radius @xmath4 ( see @xmath4 in panel ( a ) and @xmath33 in panel ( h ) in the figure ) .",
    "@xmath4 becomes smaller with the accretion , while observed higher luminosity bulges have larger effective radii ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* among others ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the primary bulge material remains unaltered , while the bulge region receives a large inward piling up of disk particles that rises the central galactic brightness , making the effective radius decrease . on the other hand ,",
    "the slope for the bulge central brightness @xmath49 is very different from the observed value also , despite its sign is positive in both cases ( see table [ tab : slopes ] ) .",
    "moreover , we find a correlation between the bulge effective brightness and l@xmath50 , while bgp04 do not detect a clear tendency in their sample of intermediate- to early - type spirals .",
    "of course , these discrepancies remain important limitations of the current accretion models . probably , these problems are associated to the fact that models without star formation and gas hydrodynamics implemented give an incomplete vision of the physical processes involved in the galactic accretions .",
