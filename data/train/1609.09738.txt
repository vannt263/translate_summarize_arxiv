    "as we shall see , lhcb data for the exclusive process @xmath10 in the rapidity interval @xmath11 should , in principle , be able to probe the gluon pdf down to about @xmath12 .",
    "the process is driven by the quasielastic subprocess @xmath13 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : subproc ] .",
    "in fact lhcb data for this process at 13 tev have just become available @xcite , see the first plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : lhcb16 ] .    [ h ]    [ h ]    following fig .",
    "[ fig : subproc ] , the lhcb collaboration have extracted the cross sections for @xmath14 from the @xmath15 data using  =  s^2(w_+)(k_+ ) _ + ( p )  +  s^2(w_-)(k_- ) _",
    "-(p ) where the survival probabilities of the large rapidity gaps , @xmath16 , and the photon fluxes , @xmath17 , are known ; @xmath18 is the energy of the photon .",
    "there are two contributions according as to whether the photon is emitted from one or the other proton , with corresponding different @xmath19 energies squared @xmath20 .",
    "the interference term is negligible .",
    "long ago , ryskin @xcite gave the lo expression for the exclusive cross section in terms of the gluon pdf @xmath21 ^ 2\\ , , \\label{eq : lo}\\ ] ] with @xmath22 , and where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the mass and electronic width of the @xmath25 .",
    "the kinematic variables are @xmath26 and @xmath27 is the @xmath19 centre - of - mass energy .",
    "we assume the @xmath28 dependence to be exponential , i.e. @xmath29 , where the energy - dependent @xmath28 slope parameter , @xmath30 , has the form @xmath31 where the pomeron slope @xmath32 gev@xmath33 and @xmath34  gev . from fig .",
    "[ fig : subproc ] we see that the quasielastic process actually depends on the gluon generalized parton distribution ( gpd@xmath35 ) , where @xmath36 is the skewedness parameter of fig .",
    "[ fig : subproc ] .",
    "however this is not a problem , since for @xmath37 ( , x )  =  pdf(x ) ( , x , x ) , to @xmath38 , where the conventional pdf is convoluted with the shuvaev tranform @xcite .",
    "we will allow for skewing and the real part of the amplitude exactly as in @xcite .",
    "to constrain the * collinear factorization * scale , @xmath39 , at which the gluon is measured , we need the nlo correction .",
    "however , we encounter very bad convergence of the lo , nlo , ... perturbation series at low @xmath40 and low scales . the reason can be seen by estimating the average number @xmath41 of additional gluons emitted in the low @xmath42 domain n  ( 3_s/ )  ln(1/ )  ( ^2_f )  ~  5 , whereas including the nlo correction accounts for only one additional gluon !",
    "given the above remarks , why is the jmrt ` nlo ' prediction so reasonable in fig .",
    "[ fig : lhcb16 ] ?",
    "the reason is that we use the * @xmath2 factorization * procedure to obtain the approximate nlo correction to the coefficient functions by performing the explicit @xmath2 integration in the last step of the evolution @xcite , and use an input pdf with resummed @xmath43 terms arising from ladder diagrams , see fig  [ fig : cfnq ] .",
    "this is not the complete nlo contribution , but it includes the most important diagrams at low @xmath1 and low @xmath44 . to do this",
    "we need the gluon pdf unintegrated over @xmath2 , f(x , k_t^2 )  =  /k^2_t , where @xmath45 , and where the sudakov factor @xmath46 is required to ensure no additional gluons are emitted with transverse momenta greater than @xmath2 .",
    "that is , we replace the [ .... ] in ( [ eq : lo ] ) by _ q_0",
    "^ 2^(w^2-m_^2)/4  + q_0  contribution , [ eq : nlointegral ] where the convergence of the integral over @xmath2 is ensured ( even for an infinite upper limit ) by the factor @xmath47 . by parameterizing the gluon @xmath48 in double logarithm form we sum the leading @xmath49 contributions .",
    "the parameters were obtained @xcite by fitting the 7 tev lhcb data @xcite , and were used to make the predictions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lhcb16 ] .    [ h ]",
    "[ h ]    unfortunately the ` nlo ' gluon pdf obtained in the @xmath2 factorization scheme , can not be directly related to the @xmath50 pdfs of the global parton analyses .",
    "there we work in the collinear factorization scheme .",
    "although the nlo contribution is explicitly known in this scheme , there are problems @xcite .",
    "as mentioned before , there is very bad perturbative convergence in the prediction for @xmath51 .",
    "indeed , the nlo correction is comparable or larger than the lo result and is opposite in sign .",
    "moreover there is strong dependence on the choice of the factorization scale @xmath39 .",
    "this is clearly visible in the left plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : scale ] , which shows the predictions at lo , and the correction due to nlo , for factorization scales @xmath52 gev@xmath53 .",
    "however we can improve the situation by resumming the @xmath49 terms and moving them into the lo contribution by a particular choice of factorization scale ; namely @xmath54 .",
    "the details are given in ref .",
    "the result is that the @xmath51 amplitude is of the form a(_f )",
    "=  c^lo ( _ f )  +  c^nlo_rem(_f)(_f ) . with this choice of @xmath39",
    "there is a smaller remaining contribution in the nlo coefficient function , and so the residual dependence on the scale @xmath55 is reduced , as seen in the right plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : scale ] .",
    "nevertheless we still have very bad perturbative convergence .",
    "the nlo correction is still comparable to the lo result , and opposite in sign !    can anything more be done ?",
    "we must investigate the effect of an important @xmath56 cut .",
    "recall dglap evolution starts at some input scale @xmath56 . at leading order everything below @xmath56",
    "is included in the input pdfs at @xmath56 . however , at nlo , the contribution to the coefficient functions from the region @xmath57 result in double counting . here",
    "@xmath58 is the four momentum of the @xmath28-channel gluons in the collinear version of the quark coefficient function of fig .",
    "[ fig : cfnq ] . to be consistent we need to subtract the nlo(@xmath57 ) contribution from both the quark and gluon coefficient functions , @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the formulae that come from this non - trivial calculation are given in the appendix of ref .",
    "we use them to perform the numerical computations to obtain the nlo prediction after the subtractions .",
    "the result is shown in the lower plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : capture ] .",
    "we now have perturbative stability ; the nlo contribution becomes a much smaller correction to the lo prediction .",
    "it should be emphasized that the asymptotics of the nlo amplitude is used only to determine the effective scale @xmath39 . in all our further numerics",
    "we use the full expressions for the nlo amplitudes .",
    "[ h ]    throughout we have chosen the renormalization scale equal to the factorization scale , that is @xmath61 .",
    "the arguments are as follows .",
    "first , this corresponds to the blm prescription  @xcite ; such a choice eliminates from the nlo terms the contribution proportional to @xmath62 ( that is , the term @xmath63 in eq . ( 3.95 ) of @xcite .",
    "second , following the discussion in  @xcite for the analogous qed case , we note that the new quark loop insertion into the gluon propagator appears twice in the calculation . the part with scales @xmath64 is generated by the virtual component ( @xmath65 ) of the lo splitting during dglap evolution , while the part with scales @xmath66 accounts for the running @xmath67 behaviour obtained after the regularization of the ultraviolet divergence . in order not to miss some contribution and/or to avoid double counting",
    "we take the renormalization scale equal to the factorization scale , @xmath61 .",
    "we have shown that the bad perturbative convergence and the large sensitivity of the qcd prediction for exclusive @xmath25 forward production can be avoided if ( i ) the factorization scale is chosen to be @xmath54 so that the double log terms , @xmath49 , in the nlo coefficient functions are transferred to the lo contribution , and ( ii ) the @xmath57 contribution is removed from the nlo coefficient functions to avoid double counting .",
    "these modifications provide reasonable accuracy for the nlo @xmath68 amplitude in the collinear @xmath50 factorization scheme , and open the possibility that data , for high precision exclusive production of @xmath25 mesons in the forward direction , can be included in the global parton analyses to determine the low @xmath1 gluon pdf .",
    "exclusive @xmath69 production can be predicted more reliably theoretically than @xmath25 production , but there will be fewer experimental events .",
