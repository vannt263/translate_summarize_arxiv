    "the equivalence between amenability of a group and property a of its box space provides us with a source of examples of spaces without a. box spaces were also the first examples of spaces which coarsely embed into hilbert space but do not have property a. such a space with unbounded geometry was first exhibited by nowak @xcite , in the form of a disjoint union of cubes of increasing dimension .",

    "the final step is showing that the wall metric and the original metric are coarsely equivalent , using the fact that the girth of the graphs tends to infinity .",
    "the main idea of our generalization is that instead of using a wall space structure coming from the covering groups being cubes @xmath60 , one can obtain a metric with respect to which the box space embeds using the result of nowak that given any finite group @xmath61 , the disjoint union @xmath62 coarsely embeds into hilbert space .",
    "this result appears as part of nowak s example of a non - bounded geometry metric space which embeds into hilbert space but does not have property a @xcite .",

    "thanks to the result of nowak , one can show that @xmath66 coarsely embeds into hilbert space with respect to this new metric .",
    "we then use large girth to show that the two metrics on @xmath66 are coarsely equivalent .    to find new examples of embeddable box spaces , we look at the derived @xmath0-series @xmath70 of a finitely generated free group @xmath33 for @xmath40 .",

    "we can now add all of the ingredients of the previous section to get the following general result , which will in particular apply to box spaces of free groups .",
    "[ main ] let @xmath65 be a sequence of @xmath47-connected finite graphs such that for each @xmath200 , the number of maximal spanning trees in @xmath32 not containing a given edge does not depend on the edge .",
    "given @xmath40 , let @xmath201 be the sequence of @xmath68-homology covers of the @xmath32 . if @xmath202 as @xmath203 , then the coarse disjoint union @xmath66 coarsely embeds into hilbert space .",
    "let @xmath204 be the number of maximal spanning trees of @xmath32 not containing a given edge . using the method of the previous section",
    ", one can define a metric @xmath205 on each @xmath206 by @xmath207 , where the sum is taken over all maximal spanning trees of @xmath32 .",
    "we will write @xmath114 to mean the coarse disjoint union metric which is @xmath205 on each component @xmath206 .",
    "let @xmath30 denote the coarse disjoint union metric on @xmath66 which restricts to the natural graph metric on each component .",
    "[ ce ] the identity map between the metric spaces formed by taking @xmath66 with the two different metrics @xmath30 and @xmath114 is a coarse equivalence , i.e. the identity map and its inverse are both coarse embeddings .",
    "it was proved in the previous section that @xmath205 is always smaller than the natural graph metric on each @xmath206 and so we need only prove that for each @xmath15 there is an @xmath17 such that @xmath208 implies @xmath209 for all @xmath210 .      now if @xmath217 with @xmath208 , then either @xmath218 whence @xmath209 by the definition of @xmath184 , or @xmath219 for @xmath220 . for this @xmath206 , proposition",
    "[ compare ] tells us that the restriction of the identity map to balls of radius @xmath221 in @xmath206 is an isometry .",
    "this means we have @xmath222 and so the proof is complete .",
    "proposition [ indepemb ] in the previous section tells us that each @xmath206 , being a @xmath68-homology cover , admits a coarse embedding into hilbert space with respect to the metric @xmath114 .",
    "moreover , the embedding functions @xmath188 depend only on @xmath40 and not on @xmath32 , and so the embedding is uniform over all @xmath200 .",
    "hence , @xmath66 with the metric @xmath114 coarsely embeds into hilbert space .",
    "now the theorem is proved since by proposition [ ce ] above the metric @xmath114 is coarsely equivalent to @xmath30 , the metric arising from the natural graph metrics on @xmath66 .",
    "we now apply theorem [ main ] to certain box spaces of free groups .",
    "let @xmath33 be the free group on @xmath200 generators , and let @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath70 denote the derived @xmath0-series of @xmath33 .",
    "note that this is a nested sequence of finite index characteristic subgroups of @xmath33 , so it makes sense to talk about the box space @xmath59 .",
    "each successive quotient @xmath223 is the @xmath68-homology cover of @xmath224 .    to apply the above , set @xmath32 to be @xmath225",
    "we then have that @xmath66 is equal to @xmath226 and so to show that the box space @xmath59 is embeddable , we need to show that the assumptions of theorem [ main ] are satisfied .",
    "it is clear that the graphs @xmath225 are 2-connected , and since @xmath226 is a box space of the free group , we have that @xmath227 as @xmath203 .",
    "it remains to show that for each @xmath200 , the number of maximal spanning trees in @xmath225 not containing a given edge does not depend on the edge chosen .",
    "this is clear , since permuting the generators of @xmath33 induces an isomorphism of @xmath225 , and hence a graph isomorphism of the corresponding cayley graph .",
    "in particular , taking such a box space of a free group @xmath228 with @xmath229 gives new examples of bounded geometry metric spaces which coarsely embed into hilbert space but do not have property a , since non - abelian free groups are not amenable .",
