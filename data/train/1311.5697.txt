    "decomposing the restriction of an irreducible representation of a group to its subgroup onto irreducible components is one of the basic problems of the representation theory . under special circumstances , as the group and the subgroup become large , such decomposition may be subject to a law of large numbers type concentration phenomenon  the bulk of the decomposition consists of representations that are in some sense close to each other .",

    "its restriction to @xmath13 decomposes on isotypical components corresponding to irreducible representations of @xmath8 , or to partitions of @xmath14 ( equivalently , young diagrams with @xmath14 boxes ) .",

    "one needs to normalize the row and column lengths of the random young diagram @xmath15 by @xmath14 to see the almost sure convergence to a point configuration ( not a smooth curve ) that essentially encodes the original representation of @xmath11 .    in the present paper",

    "one can define ( see @xcite , section  2.6 ) a discrete time markov dynamics on the triangular arrays as above with the following property : for any @xmath188 , at each time @xmath413 the distribution of the vector @xmath416 coincides with the distribution of @xmath417 , where @xmath418 are the coordinates of the random signature distributed according to the measure @xmath415 . in particular , for @xmath419 the distribution of the @xmath2th level of the array coincides with the measure @xmath420 .",

    "the plot of the height function with a fixed 3rd coordinate can be viewed as a random two - dimensional surface in @xmath431 .",
    "as was mentioned above , the growth of the height function can be realized as a result of markov dynamics with local interactions .",
    "the theory of hydrodynamic limits of random growth models allows one to predict the type of the modification of the limit shape when we add parameters with the use of local markov dynamics .",
    "namely , one can expect that the limit height function obeys an evolution equation of the form @xmath432 where @xmath433 is a function of two variables uniquely determined by the function @xmath434 ( or , equivalently , by the type of parameters that we add ) .",
