    "the basis of schur functions is arguably the most interesting and important basis for the ring of symmetric functions .",
    "this is due not just to their elegant combinatorial definition , but more broadly to their connections to other areas of mathematics .",
    "for example , they are intimately tied to the cohomology ring of the grassmannian , and they appear in the representation theory of the symmetric group and of the general and special linear groups .",
    "it is therefore natural to consider the expansion of the product @xmath0 of two schur functions in the basis of schur functions .",

    "though we will postpone the preliminary definitions to section  [ sec : prelims ] and the statement of the pieri rule to section  [ sec : skewpieri ] , stating the rule in a rough form will give its flavor .",
    "for a partition @xmath2 and a positive integer @xmath3 , the pieri rule states that @xmath4 is a sum of schur functions @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is obtainable by adding cells to the diagram of @xmath2 according to a certain simple rule .",
    "the pieri rule s prevalence is highlighted by its adaptions to many other settings , including schubert polynomials @xcite , llt polynomials @xcite , hall  littlewood polynomials @xcite , jack polynomials @xcite , and macdonald polynomials @xcite .",
    "it is therefore surprising that there does not appear to be a known adaption of the pieri rule to the most well - known generalization of schur functions , namely skew schur functions .",
    "we fill this gap in the literature with a natural extension of the pieri rule to the skew setting . reflecting the simplicity of the classical pieri rule , the skew pieri rule states that for a skew shape @xmath7 and a positive integer @xmath3 , @xmath8 is a signed sum of skew schur functions @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is obtainable by adding cells to the diagram of @xmath7 according to a certain simple rule .",
    "our proof is purely combinatorial , using a sign - reversing involution that reflects the combinatorial proof of the classical pieri rule . after reading an earlier version of this manuscript , which included an algebraic proof of the case @xmath11 due to richard stanley , thomas lam provided a complete algebraic proof of our skew pieri rule .",
    "it is natural to ask if our skew pieri rule can be extended to give a `` skew '' version of the littlewood ",

    "thus we can apply lemma  [ lem : horizontal](a ) to deduce that @xmath211 will necessarily remain strictly right of the bumping path for @xmath34 .",
    "finally , by lemma  [ lem : horizontal](c ) , we have that @xmath212 .",
    "thus , by ( a ) and ( b ) lemma  [ lem : horizontal ] , inserting the remaining entries still results in the addition of a horizontal strip .",
    "our involution will consist of either applying a downward slide or an upward slide .",

    "we refer the reader to examples  [ exa : downward ] and  [ exa : upward ] for illustrations of the ideas of the proof .",
    "first suppose that @xmath215 . by definition  [ def : involution ] ,",
    "the first way in which this can happen is if @xmath42 has neither an upward path nor a downward path .",
    "this corresponds to the case @xmath199 in definition  [ def : downward ] which , by lemma  [ lem : inverse](b ) , results in @xmath216 , trivially an involution .    therefore , assume the downward path of @xmath42 exists and exits right , so by proposition  [ prop : downshape ] , @xmath217 has the required shape .",
    "moreover , since @xmath153 adds a cell to @xmath76 , @xmath217 must have an upward path .",
    "suppose cell @xmath188 is at the top of the downward path of @xmath42 .",
    "it follows from lemma  [ lem : horizontal ] that all cells strictly right of @xmath188 and above @xmath2 in @xmath42 have reverse bumping paths strictly right of the downward path of @xmath42 and , by definition of the downward path , their reverse row insertions all land in row 0 .",

    "therefore either @xmath217 has no downward path or the downward path does not exit right , and so @xmath218 .    to show that @xmath219 , first consider @xmath220 applied to @xmath42 .",
    "after reverse row inserting along the reverse bumping paths including the downward path , suppose we have arrived at an ssyt @xmath102 .",
    "we next row insert the final entries @xmath221 of definition  [ def : downward ] .",
    "these new bumping paths may have been affected by the changes on the downward path but , as shown in the proof of proposition  [ prop : downshape ] , the bumping path @xmath108 of @xmath185 still lies weakly right of the downward path .",
    "next , we consider the application of @xmath207 to @xmath153 and observe that , since the downward path of @xmath42 exits right , it shares a bottom cell with the upward path of @xmath153 . thus the upward path must stay weakly left of the downward path and , in particular , @xmath108 lies weakly right of the upward path .",
    "moreover , @xmath108 corresponds to the @xmath208 of definition  [ def : upward ] since , as mentioned in the previous paragraph , reverse bumping paths further left will have a bottom cell that is strictly left of the bottom cell of the upward path .",
    "a key idea is now evident : after we perform the first part of @xmath207 by applying the reverse row insertions , we will return to the ssyt @xmath102 . therefore , the rest of the application of @xmath207 to @xmath153 will invert the reverse row insertions from the application of @xmath220 to @xmath42 , as required .    next , suppose @xmath222 . by definition  [ def : involution ]",
    ", @xmath42 has an upward path and either has no downward path or the downward path does not exit right .",
    "so , the downward path , if it exists , does not stay weakly right of the upward path .",
    "in particular , all the final entries of the reverse row insertions in the upward slide land in row 0 .",
    "so by proposition  [ prop : upshape ] , @xmath217 has the required shape .",
    "if none of the reverse bumping paths @xmath206 in the upward slide of @xmath42 intersect the upward path then , as we observed in the proof of proposition  [ prop : upshape ] , applying @xmath207 to @xmath42 will simply amount to row insertion along the upward path , with any movement along the @xmath117 being inverted in the course of applying @xmath207 . in particular , the upward path of @xmath42 will become the downward path of @xmath192 and hence it exits right .",
    "again , the downward path of @xmath192 will not intersect the other reverse bumping paths of @xmath192 , which will still be @xmath206 . so applying @xmath220 to @xmath192",
    "will simply amount to the reverse row insertion along the downward path .",
    "thus @xmath223 .    on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath208 from definition  [ def : upward ] intersects the upward path , we know from the proof of proposition  [ prop : upshape ] that internally inserting the bottom entry @xmath34 of the upward path into the row above will eventually follow @xmath208 and all other insertions will have bumping paths @xmath224 strictly to the right .",
    "therefore this bumping path for @xmath34 will become the downward path of @xmath192 and again it clearly exits right .",
    "thus when we apply @xmath220 to @xmath192 , we will first reverse row insert along the @xmath118 and then invert the changes caused by the internal insertion of @xmath34 . as a result ,",
    "when we complete the @xmath220 operation by reinserting the final entries of @xmath225 , the bumping paths will be the same as the original reverse bumping paths when we applied @xmath207 to @xmath42 .",
    "thus @xmath223 .",
    "we now have all the ingredients needed to prove the skew pieri rule .    using the expansion of @xmath9 in terms of ssyts  as in ,",
    "observe that if @xmath226 , then the @xmath42 and @xmath217 occur with different signs in the right - hand side of .",
    "since @xmath213 clearly preserves the monomial associated to an ssyt , the monomials corresponding to @xmath42 and @xmath217 in the right - hand side of will cancel out . because @xmath227 , it remains to show that there is a monomial - preserving bijection from fixed points of @xmath213 to ssyts  of shape @xmath151 .",
    "note that @xmath42 is a fixed point of @xmath213 only if @xmath42 has neither an upward path nor a downward path .",
    "this happens if and only if @xmath228 and when reverse row inserting the cells of @xmath69 from right to left , every final entry lands in row 0 .",
    "in particular , the entries of @xmath42 remaining after reverse row inserting the cells of @xmath69 form an ssyt of shape @xmath7 .",
    "say the final entries of the reverse row insertions are @xmath229 in the order removed . by lemma",
    "[ lem : horizontal](c ) , since @xmath69 is a horizontal strip , we have @xmath148 and so these entries form an ssyt of shape @xmath149 . by lemma  [ lem :",
    "inverse ] , this process is invertible and therefore establishes the desired bijection .",
    "we proved theorem  [ thm : skewpieri ] by working with ssyts .",
    "in particular , we showed that the two sides of   were equal when expanded in terms of monomials .",
    "alternatively , we could consider the expansions of both sides of   in terms of schur functions .",

    "( the interested reader unfamiliar with lr - fillings can find the definition in @xcite . )",
    "it is not hard to check that our maps @xmath220 and @xmath207 send lr - fillings to lr - fillings , and bumping within lr - fillings has some nice properties .",
    "for example , the entries along a ( reverse ) bumping path are always @xmath234 from bottom to top for some @xmath90 .    however , we chose to give our proof in terms of ssyts because one does not need to invoke the power of the littlewood ",
    "richardson rule to prove the classical pieri rule , and we wanted the same to apply to the skew pieri rule .",
    "we would like to conclude by asking if the skew pieri rule can be shown to be a special case of a larger framework .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite both give general setups that might be relevant .",
    "it would be of obvious interest if these frameworks or any others in the literature could be used to rederive the skew pieri rule .    in a similar spirit",
