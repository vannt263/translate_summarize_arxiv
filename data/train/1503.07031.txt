    "trapped laser - cooled ions are a prolific starting point for many experiments related to quantum information science @xcite and precision spectroscopy , yielding some of the most accurate clock standards to date @xcite .",
    "ions can be trapped for long times and laser - cooled , even to the motional ground state @xcite .",
    "they are one of the most promising candidates for quantum computation @xcite and for quantum simulations where the quantum mechanical properties of a system difficult to investigate directly is simulated using the well - understood and -controlled quantum system of trapped ions @xcite .",
    "the size of this quantum system can be scaled up by entangling few - ion systems in complex segmented trapping architectures @xcite .",
    "the conceptual starting point for all this research is one or several ions at rest , more accurately , close to the motional ground state of an effective , approximately harmonic trapping potential @xcite .",
    "the laplace equation forbids the existence of electrostatic potential minima in vacuum ( _ earnshaw theorem _ ) .",
    "this limitation is bypassed in radio - frequency ( rf ) quadrupole ( paul ) traps , where the ions are confined by an inhomogeneous oscillating field @xcite , and the oscillation energy of the forced oscillation becomes position dependent . upon the presence of a cooling mechanism such as laser cooling , an ion comes to rest at the minimum of the oscillating field amplitude .",
    "additional direct current ( dc ) fields from biased electrodes or surface charges , e.g.  , created by the loading process , can add forces which push the ion away from the rf null ; in addition , a phase mismatch between rf electrodes might even prevent the existence of a time - independent rf null . in both cases",
    ", the ion will carry out a forced oscillation at the drive frequency , the so called micromotion , with an amplitude depending on dc and phase mismatch .",
    "micromotion plays an important role in excess heating of trapped ions , e.g.  , through unwanted doppler shifts @xcite and in conjunction with inevitable anharmonicities or stochastic changes of the trapping potential @xcite .",
    "renewed interest in micromotion minimization comes from recent research with combined traps of neutral and charged atoms @xcite where excess micromotion is a detrimental source of neutral atom loss and has prevented collisional cooling of ions by a cold neutral atom cloud to the fundamental limits @xcite . here , as an initial stage of combined traps , micromotion is carefully compensated and the neutral atom loss can be used as a figure of merit for optimization @xcite .",
    "micromotion can be overcome altogether by using a dipole trap for the ion .",
    "as the light interacts with the dipole moment of the ion instead of the charge , dipole traps are much softer and shallower and themselves require carefully balanced dc offset fields as a prerequisite @xcite .",
    "another motivation for low micromotion comes from precision spectroscopy and frequency standards : micromotion sidebands spoil the accuracy of the determination of atomic resonance frequencies due to doppler shifts , and thus micromotion minimization is an essential prerequisite for accurate ion trap frequency standards .",
    "one disadvantage , though not a matter of principle , is that ion clocks suffer in short term stability , as just one atom is probed .",
    "massively parallel interrogation of many ions in common or separate traps , all micromotion compensated , is an important step to improve the short term stability of ion based frequency standards @xcite .",
    "micromotion minimization can thus be regarded as a common crucial initial step and prerequisite for good trap performance .",
    "micromotion causes diverse signatures , for which several minimization methods have been developed :    1 .",
    "the ion s absorption and emission spectra are altered due to the periodic doppler shifts caused by micromotion directly or by mechanisms conditioned on the presence of excess micromotion .",
    "+ micromotion minimization is performed by exploiting the doppler shift induced temporal correlation between the scattering rate and the rf trapping voltage @xcite and by measurement of micromotion sidebands in the absorption spectrum @xcite or the emission spectrum @xcite spaced by the trap drive frequency .",
    "+ for ion crystals the normal mode spectrum can be altered by excess micromotion and compensation of stray electric fields can be performed by minimization of these frequency shifts @xcite .",
    "[ methodrevisisted ] the ion s equilibrium position depends on the strength of the effective trapping potential if the dc fields are not nulled at the rf node . + excess micromotion is detected by monitoring the ion s average position while changing the strength of the effective trapping potential using either dc fields @xcite or changing the rf voltage amplitude @xcite .",
    "parametric resonances of the ion s motion can be excited by a modulation of the rf trapping voltage , if the dc fields are not nulled at the rf node .",
    "+ the excitation of such a resonance causes a change in the ion s scattering rate , which is then minimized @xcite .",
    "micromotion causes an collisional transfer of kinetic ernergy from the ion s micromotion to neutral atoms when trapped simultaneously .",
    "+ micromotion minimization is performed by measurements of the loss rate of the atom trap @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit the trap modulation technique , ( [ methodrevisisted ] ) . for different rf levels , we determine the three - dimensional ( 3d ) ion position from a tomographic imaging procedure . this position can be determined with an uncertainty far below the wavelength of light scattered off the ion for observation . from the ion positions measured at different rf powers , we can extrapolate the ion trajectory to infinite rf power , which ends at the rf null .",
    "with the knowledge gathered from a single trajectory , the ion can be moved to the rf null by changing the dc electric fields , which requires accurate _ a priori _ characterization of the trapping fields . as an alternative",
    ", trajectories recorded at different dc settings readily yield this characterization , together with the optimized compensation voltages .    the time required for the minimization process can be crucial if the dc fields are fluctuating .",
    "this can happen as a consequence of stray charges and , usually to a lesser extent , by drifting fields from unstable voltage supplies @xcite .",
    "for surface traps trapping times can be in the second or minute range owing to smaller trap depths and might require frequent reloading and patch potentials may change on a short timescale .",
    "in such cases it is desirable to carry out the minimization fast and repeatedly to track or compensate time - dependent effects .",
    "the method discussed here relies on position determination , which can be carried out with a high precision and does not require any narrow transition and ultra stable lasers for sideband spectroscopy .",
    "a single position determination in two dimensions requires only milliseconds of measurement time , accumulating to a few hundred milliseconds of data acquisition for the complete minimization process .",
    "if position determination and the minimization are carried out in three dimensions , we need to use a tomographic method and the approach is slowed down by about an order of magnitude . on the other hand , even then , no constraints on the propagation direction of the laser limit the optimization procedure . as the position determination is based on imaging , the optimization might even be carried out for several ions in parallel , which is of particular interest for frequency standards .",

    "the accompanying change in temperature might affect the trap geometry due to thermal expansion and might result in an rf power dependence of the rf node .",
    "the rf node yielded by the trajectory analysis might then be different from the rf node present during normal trap operation .",
    "if the time between changes in the rf power is short compared to the time constant for temperature changes in the trap structure , the rapid changes in the rf drive will average to an effective rf power throughout the measurement .",
    "thus the temperature of the system does not change significantly if the effective power during the measurement is matched to the constant rf power during normal operation .",
    "this matching can always be achieved by the choice of rf powers that are sampled during the minimization process .    in our particular setup",
    "the trap is composed of gold - plated aluminium oxide glued and wire - bonded to an actively cooled aluminium oxide holder @xcite . given the low thermal resistivity of our trap - holder setup and its good thermal coupling to the cooling system , we estimate the time constant for temperature changes of the trap - holder system to be large compared to the time between changes in the rf power for our measurements ( a few tens of milliseconds ) .",
    "also , our comparatively low maximal rf trapping voltage ( ) ( and , thus , low heating power ) limits the system to only small temperature changes .",
    "in addition , the order in which measurements at different rf powers are carried out adds to the averaging effect .",
    "thus , the conditions for an effective constant rf drive power are fulfilled in the experiments presented here .",
    "a non - negligible change in the trap geometry caused by the changes in the rf power would manifest itself in a discrepancy between model and measurement data .",
    "a change in the trap geometry would yield both a change in the rf trap frequencies @xmath126 [ eq .",

    "( [ eq : equilibriumeffectivesimple ] ) ] , which is not observed in the experiment ( fig .",
    "[ fig : compensation2d ] ) .    in general ,",
    "even if a trap structure exhibits a time constant for rf - drive - induced temperature changes that is comparable to the time required to take a single image of the ion , and if thermal deformation of the trap geometry is of concern , the latter can be avoided .",
    "the single - image exposure can always be shortened such that the averaging condition mentioned above is fulfilled .",
    "the whole measurement sequence will then be executed repeatedly and the single - image position determination is performed by averaging over repetitions of the measurement sequence , with only a minor effect of increased readout noise .",
    "if constant rf power is mandatory , the method presented here can also be carried out by a variation of a dc voltage bias applied to the rf or dc electrodes instead of the rf power variation @xcite . under variation of a dc bias",
    "symmetrically applied to the rf or dc electrodes , the rf trap frequencies will remain constant , while the dc trap frequencies change .",
    "as in the case of an rf power variation the ion s equilibrium position will follow hyperbolic trajectories [ eq .  ( [ eq : equilibriumeffectivesimple ] ) ] .",
    "by construction , an ideal linear trap features no axial rf electric field component and therefore no axial micromotion . for all realizations with finite - size electrodes , particularly for segmented traps , regions of non - negligible axial micromotion",
    "can not be avoided , although recent results have demonstrated trap designs with small residual axial rf field components @xcite .",
    "the focus of segmented traps , such as the one used here , often lies in the storage and manipulation of ion crystals .",
    "such operations , e.g.  , shuttling , splitting , and merging , make use of an extended region along the almost - micromotion - free symmetry axis of the linear trap . in these cases a space curve of positions of minimized radial micromotion along the axial direction may be used to optimize the operation of the trap . in a similar sense ,",
    "when experimenting with extended linear ion crystals oriented along this axis , finding a single point of vanishing axial micromotion is not meaningful .",
    "any axial offset from this ideal position , as long as it is much smaller than the extent of the crystal will have a small effect .",
    "so the level of precision aimed for in the determination of the axial position will be of the order of a micrometer or slightly less .    if the axial positions of trapped ions are not constrained by other experimental requirements , minimization of axial as well as radial micromotion can be performed .",

    "the filled black circle shows the position of the rf node . ]",
    "in @xcite a comparison of several micromotion minimization approaches is given in terms of various figures of merit , such as the residual electric stray field uncertainty , the micromotion amplitude , and the average kinetic energy of micromotion , which relates to the second - order doppler shift .",
    "for a specific experiment , one of these numbers might be more suitable or relevant than the others .",
    "the micromotion amplitude and the average kinetic energy depend , to different extents , on the ion mass and on the drive and secular frequencies .",
    "these numbers vary substantially throughout the ion trapping community , therefore the residual electric stray field uncertainty @xmath132 , from which the other quantities mentioned above can be derived , is the relevant quantity that can easily be compared among experiments . in general , by increasing the rf drive power , one can , within the constraints given by the experiment , reduce the effect of micromotion .    in table",
    "( [ tab : performancecomparison ] ) the outcomes of several minimization methods are listed .",
    "the final level of precision of micromotion minimization can be scaled in each method by changing the averaging time for data taking , as long as the stray fields to be compensated are stable .",
    "ultimately , as our minimization approach relies on imaging , the position determination and , in turn , the determination of the rf null location are shot noise limited .",
    "thus another question to ask is the sensitivity of a minimization method , that is , on what timescale what level of precision is obtained . here",
    ", almost no information was found in the literature .",
    "the observed fluorescence rate is limited by the @xmath79 transition of ^172^yb^+^and its linewidth @xmath133{2\\pi x 19.2}{\\mega\\hertz}$ ] , the solid angle covered by our light gathering optics ( of @xmath134 ) and its transmission , and the quantum efficiency of our camera ( ) . with these constraints and the time required for the translation of our optics ( about ) , recording a data set such as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : compensation2d ] takes about and directly yields all compensation voltages .",
    "we achieve a sensitivity of the residual electric field in the radial directions of @xmath135 .    [ cols=\"<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : lightpressureratios ]    the best sensitivity and uncertainty are achieved for lightweight particles and low trap frequencies along the direction of the scattering force [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : lightpressureshift ] ) ] .",
    "as the sensitivity depends on position accuracy , the measurement can again be optimized for either precision or speed . for our setup",
    "we report a sensitivity for the measurement of the light pressure force along the @xmath70 direction of @xmath136 ( total exposure of a differential measurement : ) , with our minimal absolute uncertainty being @xmath137 .",
    "in our present setup , fluorescence is detected normal to the plane of the trap chip and , thus , perpendicular to the soft trapping axis along which confinement is almost purely realized by dc fields , labeled as the axial direction of our linear segmented trap ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig : trap_setup ] ) . in an ideal linear trap , the rf effective potential and",
    "thus micromotion depend exclusively on the radial coordinates , perpendicular to the axial direction . in this case position",
    "changes upon rf variation will occur only in radial directions and thus partially in the direction of our line of sight . in real traps , there might be a residual axial rf electric field , which is minimized by careful design and typically much smaller than the radial rf field strength . in segmented traps ,",
    "the intention is usually to exploit the entire axial span of the linear trap by shuttling , etc . ,  and thus axial micromotion might be present but potentially can not be minimized .",
    "micromotion minimization always requires a determination of the radial ion displacement or motion , in our case also along our line of sight .",
    "we realize this with focus - scanning imaging as detailed above . in our present setup",
    "this is one of the main limitations , in both precision and speed . as our detection of excess micromotion",
    "is based on a shift of the ion s average position , the method as presented is insensitive to micromotion induced by a phase difference between the rf trap electrodes or an rf pick up of the dc electrodes that is phase - shifted by nearby filter circuits .",
    "these effects can be avoided by design to a great extent , especially in surface traps , and are often of negligible size .",
    "detection along the axial direction of the trap would allow us to obtain the relevant displacements without the time - consuming physical translation of massive light gathering optics and reduces the number of required images considerably : right now , we take 25 focal steps and need to include additional times to wait for the completion of a translation action .",
    "additionally , omitting a translation stage further improves the mechanical stability and thus the precision of the position determination . taking into account translation and settling times as well as the reduction in the number of images ,",
    "the speed of acquisition would increase by a factor of approximately 70 , meaning that the entire minimization as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : compensation2d ] would be finished in two dimensions in roughly and the sensitivity of this method would increase to about for a 2d minimization .",
    "speed not only is relevant to keep the time for calibration , etc . , low and leave most for the experiment of interest , but also allows to compensate more often and characterize and counteract time - dependent drifts of the power supplies and patch potentials . in principle , when the effects of dc field changes of each electrode are well characterized , a single trajectory will suffice , and this might further improve the performance of the method in terms of speed .    utilizing the same technique , precise position determination of a harmonically trapped ion may also be used for the simple detection of small forces .",
    "we have demonstrated the detection of forces on the yoctonewton ( ) scale in the example of the light pressure force exerted on the ion by the cooling laser .",
    "depending on the experiment , precise knowledge of the light pressure force might be desirable to counter its effects and maintain minimal micromotion also under experimental conditions without incoherent scattering .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have presented a method , which allows us to compensate micromotion due to dc stray fields in three dimensions using focus - scanning imaging as well as the detection of rather small forces .",
    "the method is general and does not require spectroscopy of a narrow transition or a specific orientation of laser beams , which is of particular interest for surface - electrode traps .",
    "if imaging is carried out along the symmetry axis of a linear trap and the optimization is carried out in the transverse direction only , no additional components and no focus - scanning imaging are required and the optimization can be carried out within seconds .",
