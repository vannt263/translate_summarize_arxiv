    "the second point follows as @xmath21 is braided  @xcite , but @xmath20 is not braidable since there are finite - dimensional @xmath0-representations @xmath4 such that @xmath27 is not isomorphic to @xmath28  @xcite .",

    "the above corollary is equivalent to the statement that the identity functor on @xmath33 can not be endowed with a monoidal structure such that it becomes a monoidal functor from @xmath55  where the associator is given by acting with @xmath5  to @xmath33 .",
    "this is an immediate consequence of theorems * [ thm:1 ] * and * [ thm:2 ] * , as @xmath55 is braidable while @xmath33 is not .",
    "hence , there can not be a monoidal equivalence at all , let alone a monoidal structure on the identity functor .",
    "next we comment on the relation to the vertex operator algebra @xmath37 . at @xmath29 ,",
    "the vertex operator algebra @xmath23 has a symplectic fermion construction  @xcite  a chiral rational logarithmic conformal field theory at central charge @xmath7 . in  @xcite ,",
    "a braided tensor category @xmath8 of the symplectic fermion fields was obtained from monodromy properties of conformal blocks ( we review the category @xmath8 in section  * [ sec : cat - c ] * ) .",
    "in fact , due to a @xmath56-grading of the tensor product one naturally obtains four different braided monoidal categories @xmath8 which we parametrise by the parameter @xmath57 from already used for @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "the category obtained from symplectic fermion conformal blocks corresponds to @xmath58 in this convention .",
    "conjecturally , for this value of @xmath57 , @xmath8 is equivalent as a braided monoidal category to @xmath34 , but the latter has not yet been computed explicitly .",
    "[ thm:3 ] the categories @xmath59 and @xmath8 are equivalent as @xmath25-linear braided monoidal categories for each @xmath57 satisfying @xmath60 .",
    "theorem  * [ thm:3 ] * is our main result . under the conjectural",
    "braided monoidal equivalence between @xmath8 and @xmath34 , theorem  * [ thm:3 ] * is an extension of the equivalence of the representation categories of @xmath2 and of @xmath37 as @xmath25-linear categories  established in @xcite  to an equivalence of braided monoidal categories .",
    "we also note that theorem  * [ thm:3 ] * is the first example of a braided tensor equivalence between a braided tensor category obtained in a logarithmic conformal field theory and the representation category of a quantum group .    for factorisable hopf algebras",
    "one can obtain an @xmath61-action on the centre of the hopf algebra  @xcite .",
    "we observe in appendix  * [ app : sl2z ] * that  using the same expressions ( despite working with a quasi - hopf algebra )  our r - matrix defines an @xmath61-action on the centre of @xmath2 , equivalent to the one given in @xcite , which agrees with @xmath61-action via modular transformations on the space of torus conformal blocks of the @xmath62-triplet algebra .",
    "let us give a brief outline of the proof of theorem  * [ thm:3]*. the proof proceeds in three steps .",
    "first , we define an auxiliary algebra @xmath63 in @xmath64 which has half the dimension of @xmath2 . the algebra @xmath63 is equipped with a non - coassociative coproduct , resulting in a tensor product functor on @xmath65 without  so far  an associator .",
    "we then establish the existence of multiplicative equivalences @xmath66 recall that a functor @xmath67 is called _",
    "_ multiplicative _ _ if it is equipped with isomorphisms @xmath68 , natural in @xmath4 , and an isomorphism @xmath69 , on which no coherence conditions are imposed .",
    "a multiplicative functor is _ monoidal _ if @xmath70 and @xmath71 satisfy the hexagon and unit conditions . on general grounds ,",
    "it follows that there exists a quasi - bialgebra structure on @xmath2 , such that the composite functor @xmath72 is monoidal ( see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sect.9.4 ) ) .    in step 2 ,",
    "we compute @xmath5 by first finding a coassociator @xmath73 on @xmath63 , turning it into a quasi - hopf algebra in @xmath64 , such that @xmath74 is monoidal",
    ". then we transport @xmath73 along @xmath75 to @xmath33 .",
    "the reason to pass via the intermediate category @xmath65 was that both @xmath65 and @xmath8 are defined over the underlying category @xmath64 , while @xmath33 is defined over @xmath76 .",
    "passing via @xmath65 avoids excessive ( and confusing ) mixing of the tensor flips in @xmath64 and @xmath76 .",
    "step 3 consists of transporting the braiding from @xmath8 to @xmath33 and reading off the r - matrix which gives rise to this braiding . since @xmath8 is a ribbon category , we can also transport the ribbon twist to @xmath33 and we compute the corresponding ribbon element .    in presenting these steps in the body of the paper , we have opted for collecting the quasi - hopf structure of @xmath2 and of @xmath63 in one section each , rather than postponing the definition of the coassociator to a later section ( which would be the chronological account ) .",
    "we believe this improves the readability of the paper .",
    "starting from theorem * [ thm:3 ] * , there are a number of further directions which are worth pursuing .",
    "firstly , it should be relatively straightforward to generalise the construction of this paper to several pairs of symplectic fermions by taking appropriate products of the categories and algebras involved , and we expect to make contact with the results in @xcite on quantum groups at roots of unity of small order .    secondly , and more difficult , from the relation to @xmath21 one may expect the existence of a modified coproduct on @xmath0 for @xmath10 ( for the same algebra structure ) such that the tensor product becomes commutative and such that the structure of a quasi - triangular quasi - hopf algebra exists . again , a generalisation of @xmath63 may serve as a helpful intermediate step .",
    "our construction suggests that such an @xmath63 should live in @xmath77-graded vector spaces with an appropriate braiding .",
    "@xmath0 is of dimension @xmath78 and we would expect @xmath63 to be of dimension @xmath79 .",
    "of course , it would then be highly desirable to establish a braided monoidal equivalence with @xmath21 , but associator and braiding in the latter category are not yet sufficiently explicitly understood .",
    "thirdly , and less directly linked to the present paper , there are several constructions related to conformal field theory which have been formulated for hopf - algebras , and where one could take the example from theorem * [ thm:3 ] * as a starting point to look for a generalisation to quasi - hopf algebras . of particular interest to us",
    "are the construction of @xcite , which provides mapping class group invariants that can serve as bulk correlation functions in logarithmic conformal field theory , and @xcite , where a three - dimensional topological field theory is constructed starting from quantum @xmath80 at a root of unity ( but different from the @xmath0 used here ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows . in section * [ sec : qg ] * we look at @xmath2 in more detail and prove theorem  * [ thm:1]*. in section  * [ sec : cat - c ] * , we review the braided category @xmath8 of the symplectic fermions cft . in section * [ sec : s ] * , we introduce the quasi - hopf algebra @xmath63 in @xmath64 .",
