    "calculations of selfgravitating fluids onto a compact object are , in general , very difficult .",
    "so it is not suprising that this problem has been solved in only a few idealized cases .",
    "the spherical steady accretion of perfect fluids onto a newtonian gravitational center was investigated by bondi in 1952 @xcite and onto a schwarzschild black hole by michell @xcite and others @xcite .",
    "the first fully general relativistic model taking into account the backreaction was dealt with by malec @xcite .",
    "the effects of backreaction of selfgravitating fluids on a spherical black hole was examined in @xcite .",
    "the influence of backreaction of steadily accreting gases on the stability has been studied in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will briefly present the main results of @xcite .",
    "let us consider the spherically symmetric cloud of an ideal gas falling onto a non - rotating black hole .",
    "the general spherically symmetric line element is given by @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 depend on the asymptotic time variable @xmath4 and the radius @xmath5 .",
    "we assume the energy - momentum tensor of perfect fluid @xmath6 , where @xmath7 denotes the four velocity of the fluid , @xmath8 is the pressure and @xmath9 the energy density in the comoving frame .",
    "+ the conservation of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath10 leads to the continuity equation @xmath11 and to the relativistic version of the euler equation @xmath12 here the extrinsic curvature @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "the quasilocal mass @xmath15 is defined by @xmath16 .",
    "we will assume that the accretion is steady and the fluid satisfies the polytropic equation of state @xmath17 with constant @xmath18 $ ] .",
    "more precisely :    * the accretion rate , defined as @xmath19 for the given areal radius @xmath3 , is assumed to be constant in time ; * the fluid velocity @xmath20 , energy density @xmath9 , sound velocity @xmath21 etc . should remain constant on the surface of fixed @xmath3 : @xmath22 , where @xmath23    strictly saying , a stationary accretion must lead to the increase of the central mass and of some geometric quantities .",
    "this in turn means that the notion `` steady accretion '' is approximate ",
    "it demands the mass accretion rate is small and the time scale is short , so that the quasilocal mass @xmath15 does not change significantly .",
    "+ one can show @xcite that the accretion rate is independent of the surface ( characterised by a given @xmath3 ) for which it is calculated , i.e. , @xmath24 .",
    "let us now define a sonic point as such , where the length of the spatial velocity vector equals the speed of sound @xmath25 . in the newtonian limit the above definition coincides with the standard requirement of the equality between the velocity of the fluid and the local sound speed .",
    "in the following we will denote by the asterisk all values referring to the sonic point .",
    "one of the two main results of @xcite is the observation that significant information about the full system with backreaction can be obtained through the investigation of steady flows with the test fluid approximation .",
    "it appears that the characteristics @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 of the sonic point _ practically _ do not depend , for a given @xmath29 and @xmath30 , on the asymptotic energy density @xmath31 .",
    "one can get all parameters describing the sonic point , with the exception of its location @xmath32 and mass @xmath33 simply from a related polytropic model with the test fluid having the same index @xmath29 and the same asymptotic speed of sound @xmath34 .",
    "+    the second main result come from investigation of the mass accretion rate @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "this expression clearly demonstrates that the mass accretion rate achieves a maximum at @xmath37 and tends to zero when @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( fig .",
    "[ mdot ] ) .",
    "the factor @xmath40 is universal  independent of the parameters @xmath41 , @xmath29 and @xmath34 . in the test fluid approximation",
    "the situation is quite different  the quantity @xmath42 grows with @xmath31 . + the above result show the importance of the backreaction .",
    "we are convinced that this qualitative features demonstrated by the spherically symmetric model will also appear in the descriptions of accreting fluid onto a rotating black hole .",
    "in conclusion , in the simple model of accretion with backreaction considered here , one can get all parameters describing the sonic point , with the exception of its location @xmath32 and mass @xmath33 simply from a related polytropic model with the test fluid having the same index @xmath29 and the same asymptotic speed of sound @xmath34 .",
    "the main result is that the mass accretion rate @xmath43 achieves a maximum at @xmath44 .",
    "therefore , there exist two different regimes , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , with low accretion .",
