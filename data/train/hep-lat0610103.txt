    "currently , however , observables calculated on the lattice can not be directly compared with nature due to systematic error .",
    "this error arises from approximations used in solving the theory numerically , such as the finite extent of the lattice , the non - vanishing lattice spacing , and larger than physical quark masses . for a large class of observables , effective field theories ( efts )",
    "can be tailored to describe the approximations used in lattice qcd .",
    "these efts are the reliable tool to remove systematic error in extrapolating data to the physical point , see , e.g.  @xcite . with growing computational resources and improved numerical algorithms",

    "a further limitation encountered in lattice simulations is the available momentum . with periodic boundary conditions",
    ", the momentum modes are quantized . on currently available dynamical lattices",
    ", the lowest non - vanishing momentum mode is @xmath0 .",
    "while efts can be tailored to address systematic error in lattice qcd , these low - energy theories can not be utilized to predict the momentum dependence outside the range of their applicability .",
    "the extraction of quantities requiring non - zero momentum , such as phase shifts , electromagnetic moments and radii , is thus limited by coarse grained lattice momentum .",
    "spatially periodic boundary conditions , however , are not mandated .",
    "so - called twisted boundary conditions  @xcite have gained recent attention because they can be utilized to produce continuous hadron momentum  @xcite .",
    "the electromagnetic properties of hadrons paint an intuitive picture of the charge and magnetism distributions of quarks confined in strongly interacting bound states .",
    "to resolve such properties of hadrons , one requires momentum transfer and this presents a challenge for the lattice .",
    "calculations of the pion form factor from lattice qcd , for example , have matured since the original pioneering works  @xcite , but still suffer from systematic error .",
    "recently it was demonstrated  @xcite that current dynamical calculations  @xcite of the pion charge radii are limited by systematic error relating to the momentum , chiral , and possibly also continuum extrapolations . here",
    "we show that the uncertainty surrounding the momentum extrapolation can be eliminated with flavor twisted boundary conditions . with",
    "these imposed , one can extract the charge radius from simulations at zero fourier momentum .",
    "as boundary conditions modify the long - range physics on the lattice , we must be careful to address effects of the finite volume . in  @xcite",
    "volume effects for single - particle matrix elements with twisted boundary conditions were shown to be similar to those with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "thus , provided one remains below multi - particle cuts , the effect of the finite volume is exponentially suppressed in asymptotic volumes . in practice ,",
    "lattice volumes are not asymptotically large , and the study with partially twisted boundary conditions in  @xcite found sizable volume corrections to the nucleon isovector magnetic moment , @xmath1 , even for @xmath2 .",
    "the bulk of such corrections arises from finite volume terms that do not respect hypercubic invariance .",
    "physically one expects contributions of this type because twisted boundary conditions introduce a particular direction in space . in this work ,",
    "we determine hypercubic breaking corrections to the pion dispersion relation for partially twisted boundary conditions .",
    "these corrections result in a finite volume modification to the pion s momentum",
    ". theoretical control over these volume effects is necessary wherever twisted boundary conditions are employed because of the dominance of long - range pion physics in low - energy hadronic observables .",
    "additionally we determine the finite volume effects for the extraction of the pion charge radius from lattice simulations with partially twisted boundary conditions .",
    "we further demonstrate numerically that such corrections are on the order of a few percent on current dynamical lattices .",
    "our presentation has the following organization . in section  [ disp ] , we briefly review partially twisted boundary conditions and their incorporation into partially quenched chiral perturbation theory ( pq ) . by calculating the pion self - energy , we determine the form of the pion dispersion relation in a finite box and demonstrate that the induced momentum due to twisted boundary conditions is modified by volume effects .",
    "the isopsin splitting among the pions is also evaluated in pq .",
    "next in section  [ emff ] , we show that the pion electromagnetic form factor can be determined on the lattice at continuous values of the momentum transfer . using pq",
    ", we then determine the finite volume corrections resulting from partially twisted boundary conditions .",
