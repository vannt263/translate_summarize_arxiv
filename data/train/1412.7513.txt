    "registration , the task of establishing correspondences between multiple instances of objects such as images , landmarks , curves , and surfaces , plays a fundamental role in a range of computer vision applications including shape modeling @xcite , motion compensation and optical flow @xcite , remote sension @xcite , and medical imaging @xcite . in the subfield of computational anatomy @xcite ,",
    "establishing inter - subject correspondences between organs allows the statistical study of organ shape and shape variability .",
    "examples of the fundamental role of registration include quantifying developing alzheimer s disease by establishing correspondences between brain tissue at different stages of the disease @xcite ; measuring the effect of copd on lung tissue after removing the variability caused by the respiratory process @xcite ; and correlating the shape of the hippocampus to schizophrenia after inter - subject registration @xcite .    in this paper , we survey the role of symmetry in diffeomorphic registration and deformation modeling and link symmetry as seen from the field of geometric mechanics with the image registration problem .",
    "we focus on large deformations modeled in subgroups of the group of diffeomorphic mappings on the spatial domain , the approach contained in the large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping ( lddmm , @xcite ) framework .",
    "connections with geometric mechanics @xcite have highlighted the role of symmetry and resulted in previously known properties connected with the registration of specific data types being described in a common theoretical framework @xcite .",
    "we wish to describe these connections in a form that highlights the role of symmetry and points towards future applications of the ideas .",
    "it is the aim that the paper will make the role of symmetry in registration and deformation modeling clear to the reader that has no previous familiarity with symmetry in geometric mechanics and symmetry groups in mathematics .",
    "one of the main reasons symmetry is useful in numerics is in it s ability to reduce how much information one must carry . as a toy example , consider the a top spinning in space . upon choosing some reference configuraiton ,",
    "the orientation of the top is given by a rotation matrix , i.e. an element @xmath0 .",
    "if i ask for you to give me the direction of the pointy tip of the top , ( which is pointing opposite @xmath1 in the reference ) it suffices to give me @xmath2 . however , @xmath2 is contained in space of dimension @xmath3 , while the space of possible directions is the @xmath4-sphere , @xmath5 , which is only of dimension @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , providing the full matrix @xmath2 is excessive in terms of data .",
    "it suffices to just provide the vector @xmath6 .",
    "note that if @xmath7 , then @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , given only the direction @xmath9 , we can only reconstruct @xmath2 up to an element @xmath10 which preserves @xmath1 .",
    "the group of element which preserve @xmath1 is identifiable with @xmath11 .",
    "this insight allows us to express the space of directions @xmath5 as a homogenous space @xmath12 . in terms of infomation",
    "we can cartoonishly express this by the expression @xmath13    this example is typically of all group quotients .",
    "if @xmath14 is some universe of objects and @xmath15 is a group which acts freely upon @xmath14 , then the orbit space @xmath16 hueristically contains the data of @xmath14 minus the data which @xmath15 transforms .",
    "thus @xmath17 reduction by symmetry can be implemented when a problem posed on @xmath14 has @xmath15 symmetry , and can be rewritten as a problem posed on @xmath18 .",
    "the later space containing less data , and is therefore more efficient in terms of memory .",
    "registration of objects contained in a spatial domain , e.g. the volume to be imaged by a scanner , can be formulated as the search for a deformation that transforms both domain and objects to establish an inter - object match .",
    "the data available when solving a registration problem generally is incomplete for encoding the deformation of every point of the domain .",
    "this is for example the case when images to be matched have areas of constant intensity and no derivative information can guide the registration . similarly ,",
    "when 3d shapes are matched based on similarity of their surfaces , the deformation of the interior can not be derived from the available information .",
    "the deformation model is in these cases over - complete , and a range of deformations can provide equally good matches for the data .",
    "here arises _ symmetry _ : the subspaces of deformations for which the registration problem is symmetric with respect to the available information . when quotienting out symmetry subgroups , a vastly more compact representation is obtained . in the image case ,",
    "only displacement orthogonal to the level lines of the image is needed ; in the shape case , the information left in the quotient is supported on the surface of the shape only .",
    "we start with background on the registration problem and the large deformation approach from a variational viewpoint . following this",
    ", we describe how reduction by symmetry leads to an eulerian formulation of the equations of motion when reducing to the lie algebra .",
    "symmetry of the dissimilarity measure allows additional reductions , and we use isotropy subgroups to reduce the complexity of the registration problem further .",
    "lastly , we survey the effect of symmetry in a range of concrete registration problems and end the paper with concluding remarks .",
    "the registration problem consists in finding correspondences between objects that are typically point sets ( landmarks ) , curves , surfaces , images or more complicated spatially dependent data such as diffusion weighted images ( dwi ) .",
    "the problem can be approached by letting @xmath19 be a spatial domain containing the objects to be registered .",
    "@xmath19 can be a differentiable manifold or , as is often the case in applications , the closure of an open subset of @xmath20 , @xmath21 , e.g. the unit square .",
    "a map @xmath22 can deform or warp the domain by mapping each @xmath23 to @xmath24 .",
    "acts on an image @xmath25 by composition with the inverse warp , @xmath26 .",
    "given two images @xmath27 , image registration involves finding a warp @xmath28 such that @xmath29 is close to @xmath30 as measured by a dissimilarity measure @xmath31 . ]",
    "the deformation encoded in the warp will apply to the objects in @xmath19 as well as the domain itself .",
    "for example , if the objects to be registered consist of points sets @xmath32 , @xmath33 , the set will be mapped to @xmath34 . for surfaces",
    "@xmath35 , @xmath28 similarly results in the warped surface @xmath36 . because those operations are associative ,",
    "the mapping @xmath28 acts on @xmath37 or @xmath38 and we write @xmath39 and @xmath40 for the warped objects .",
    "an image is a function @xmath25 , and @xmath28 acts on @xmath41 as well , in this case by composition with its inverse @xmath42 , see figure  [ fig : registration ] . for this @xmath28 must be is invertible , and commonly we restrict to the set of invertible and differentiable mappings @xmath43 . for various other types of data objects",
    ", the action of a warp on the objects can be defined in a way similar to the case for point sets , surfaces and images .",
    "this fact relates a range registration problems to the common case of finding appropriate warps @xmath28 that trough the action brings the objects into correspondence .",
    "trough the action , different instances of a shape can be realized by letting warps act on a base instance of the shape , and a class of shape models can therefor be obtained by using deformations to represent shapes @xcite .",
    "the search for appropriate warps can be formulated in a variational formulation with an energy @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a dissimilarity measure of the difference between the deformed objects , and @xmath2 is a regularization term that penalizes unwanted properties of @xmath28 such as irregularity .",
    "if two objects @xmath46 and @xmath47 is to be matched , @xmath45 can take the form @xmath48 using the action of @xmath28 on @xmath49 ; for image matching , an often used dissimilarity measure is the @xmath50-difference or sum of square differences ( ssd ) that has the form @xmath51 .",
    "the regularization term can take various forms often modeling physical properties such as elasticity @xcite and penalizing derivatives of @xmath28 in order to make it smooth .",
    "the free - form - deformation ( ffd , @xcite ) and related approaches penalize @xmath28 directly . for some choices of @xmath2 , existence and analytical properties of minimizers of",
    "have been derived @xcite , however it is in general difficult to ensure solutions are diffeomorphic by penalizing @xmath28 in itself .",
    "instead , flow based approaches model one - parameter families or paths of mappings @xmath52 , @xmath53 $ ] where @xmath54 is the identity mapping @xmath55 and the dissimilarity is measured at the endpoint @xmath56 .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath52 can be described by the differential equation @xmath57 with the flow field @xmath58 being a vector field on @xmath19 . the space of such fields is denoted @xmath59 . in the large deformation",
    "diffeomorphic metric mapping ( lddmm , @xcite ) framework , the regularization is applied to the flow field @xmath58 and integrated over time giving the energy @xmath60 if the norm @xmath61 that measures the irregularity of @xmath58 is sufficiently strong , @xmath52 will be a diffeomorphism for all @xmath62 .",
    "this approach thus gives a direct way of enforcing properties of the generated warp : instead of regularizing @xmath28 directly , the analysis is lifted to a normed space @xmath59 that is much easier control .",
    "the energy has the same minimizers as the geometric formulation of lddmm used in the next section .",
    "direct approaches to solving the optimization problem must handle the fact that the problem of finding a warp is now transfered to finding a time - dependent family of warps implying a huge increase in dimensionality .",
    "this problem is therefore vary hard to represent numerically and to optimize . for several data types",
    ", it has been shown how optimal paths for have specific properties that reduces the dimensionality of the problem and therefor makes practical solutions feasible . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the geometric framework and the reduction theory that allows the data dependent results to be formulated as specific examples of reduction by symmetry .",
    "we survey these examples in the following section .",
    "we here describe a geometric formulation of the registration problem @xcite and how symmetry can be used to reduce the optimization over time - dependent paths of warps to vector fields in the lie algebra resulting in an eulerian version of the equations of motion .",
    "secondly , we describe how symmetry of the dissimilarity measure allows further reduction to lower dimensional quotients .",
    "we here introduce a number of notions from differential geometry in a fairly informal manner . for formal definitions we refer to @xcite .",
    "while it is neccessary for the purpose of rigour to learn formal definitions , independent of cartoonish sketches , when learning differential geometry , one can still get quite far with cartoonish sketches .",
    "for example , by picturing a manifold , @xmath19 , as a surface embedded in @xmath63 .",
    "this is the approach we will take .",
    "the tangent bundle of @xmath19 , denoted @xmath64 , is the set of pairs @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 is a vector tangential to @xmath19 at the point @xmath68 ( see figure  [ fig : tm ] ) .",
    "a vector - field is a map @xmath69 such that @xmath70 is a vector above @xmath68 for all @xmath66 . in summary , a vector on @xmath19 is an `` admissible velocity '' on @xmath19 , and @xmath64 is the set of all possible admissible velocities .     of the manifold",
    "@xmath19 consists of pairs @xmath65 of points @xmath23 and tangent vectors @xmath71 .",
    "it s a fiber bundle over @xmath19 with fibers @xmath72 for each @xmath73 m . ]",
    "given a vector - field @xmath74 we may consider the initial value problem @xmath75 for @xmath76 $ ] . given an intial condition @xmath77 , the point @xmath78 given by solving this initial value problem is uniquely determined ( if it exists ) . under reasonable conditions @xmath79 exists for each @xmath77 , and there is a map @xmath80 which we call the flow of @xmath74 .",
    "if @xmath74 is time - dependent we can consider the initial value problem with @xmath81 . under certain conditions ,",
    "this will also yield a flow map , @xmath82 which is the flow from time @xmath83 to @xmath84 . if @xmath74 is smooth , the flow map is smooth as well , in particular a diffeophism .",
    "we denote the set of diffeomorphisms by @xmath43 .",
    "conversely , let @xmath85 be a time - dependent diffeomorphism .",
    "thus , for any @xmath66 , we observe that @xmath86 is a curve in @xmath19 .",
    "if this curve is differentiable we may consider its time - derivative , @xmath87 , which is a vector above the point @xmath86 . from these observations",
    "it imediately follows that @xmath88 is a vector above @xmath68 .",
    "therefore the map @xmath89 , given by @xmath90 is a vector - field which we call the _ eulerian velocity field of @xmath52_.    the eulerian velocity field contains less data than @xmath91 , and this reduction in data can be viewed from the perspective of symmetry . given any @xmath92 , the curve @xmath52 can be transformed to the curve @xmath93 .",
    "we observe that @xmath94 thus @xmath52 and @xmath93 both have the same eulerian velocity fields .",
    "in other words , the eulerian velocity field , @xmath95 , is invariant under particle relablings .",
    "schematically , the following holds @xmath96    finally , we will denote some linear operators on the space of vector - fields .",
    "let @xmath97 and let @xmath98 .",

    "d\\phi \\right|_{\\phi^{-1}(x ) } \\cdot u ( \\phi^{-1}(x)).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by inspection we see that @xmath102 is a linear operator on the vector - space of vector - fields .",
    "one can view @xmath100 as `` @xmath74 in a new coordinate system '' because any differential geometric property of @xmath74 is also inherited by @xmath100 .",
    "for example , if @xmath103 then @xmath104 ( y ) = 0 $ ] with @xmath105 .",
    "if @xmath38 is an invariant under @xmath74 then @xmath106 is invariant under @xmath107 .",
    "as @xmath102 is linear , we can transpose it .",

    "we define @xmath111 by the equality @xmath112 for all @xmath113 where @xmath114 denotes evaluation of @xmath115 on @xmath67 .",
