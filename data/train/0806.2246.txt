    "dipolar sle describes random curves between a boundary point and a subarc of the boundary .",
    "these various types of sle are closely related to each other and to the more general sle@xmath4 processes @xcite    we consider dipolar sle from a boundary point @xmath5 to a subarc @xmath6 of the boundary and ask what happens if we condition it to end in a subarc @xmath7 , or to end at a point @xmath8 .",
    "we will show that the result is an sle@xmath4 process . in the particular case of @xmath1 , when the dipolar sle is conditioned to end at a fixed point the distribution of the resulting curve is just chordal sle .",
    "let us observe however that even if a discrete model is known to ( or conjectured to ) converge to chordal sle@xmath0 in the continuum limit , there is at the moment very little understanding how to modify it to a discrete process candidate to converge to an sle@xmath4 in the continuum limit .",
    "even the definition of `` dipolar self avoiding walk '' escapes us at the moment .",
    "certain lattice models of random curves have special properties that allow us to identify the associated @xmath2 in the continuum limit assuming the continuum limit is an sle .",
    "the restriction property of the self avoiding walk implies that @xmath9 as the only possible candidate for the scaling limit .",
    "the locality property of percolation identifies @xmath10 as the only possible scaling limit .",
    "the loop - erased random walk ( lerw ) has another property that together with our result for @xmath1 implies that if the continuum limit is sle , then @xmath2 must be @xmath11 . for concreteness , we consider the model in the infinite strip . consider a random walk starting at the origin and conditioned to exit the strip on the upper boundary .",
    "loop - erasing this model gives what we will refer to as the dipolar lerw .",
    "if we take the original random walk which was conditioned to exit through the upper boundary and further condition it to exit through a point @xmath12 in the upper boundary , the result is the same as conditioning a random walk starting at the origin to exit the strip through @xmath12 .",
    "so if we condition the dipolar lerw to end at @xmath12 , then the result is the same as the loop erasure of a random walk starting at @xmath13 and conditioned to exit at @xmath12 .",
    "the latter is just the chordal lerw . in short ,",
    "conditioning the dipolar lerw to end at a particular point gives the chordal lerw .",
    "as we will see , sle has this property only for @xmath1 .",
    "the lerw has been proved to converge to sle@xmath3 in the scaling limit @xcite .",
    "since the lerw trivially has the property that conditioning the dipolar version to end at a fixed point give the chordal version , the proofs of convergence of the lerw to sle@xmath3 have as a corollary the result that conditioning dipolar sle@xmath3 to end at a fixed point gives chordal sle@xmath3 .",
    "nonetheless , it is desirable to have a direct proof that sle@xmath3 has this property .",
    "properties that sle satisfies for only one value of the parameter @xmath2 are useful for identifying the scaling limit of discrete or lattice models that satisfy the property .",
    "recently , claims that sle samples describe lines in a variety of 2d systems have appeared : these claims concern zero vorticity lines in turbulence @xcite , nodal lines of chaotic or random wave function @xcite and interfaces in ground states of spin glasses @xcite .",
    "the first two cases seem to involve @xmath14 ( i.e. percolation ) .",
    "this is far from fully justified , even if some heuristic theoretical arguments make this plausible .",
    "the case of spin glasses is even more intricate .",
    "the value of @xmath2 computed numerically is not too far ( but apparently reliably different ) from @xmath11 .",
    "moreover there are several definitions of the notion of interface .",
    "for some of the definitions conformal invariance has been ruled out so that only for one definition is the relationship with sle still a plausible guess .    of course numerical studies",
    "are made in finite geometries ( even with finite systems ) and the problem of finite size effects has to be taken into account . in particular dipolar sle , which is well adapted to a strip geometry , seems to give much more accurate numerical evaluations of @xmath2 and of the quadratic variation of the driving process than chordal sle .",
    "sle has been studied by researchers coming from a variety of disciplines ranging from probability to conformal field theory . to make this article accessible to these various groups , we derive our results in several ways .",
    "in addition , for several results that have already appeared in the literature we give another derivation from a different point of view .",

    "in fact one can write @xmath290 $ ] as shown by an application of it s formula .",

    "sle curves can be seen in general as interfaces in conformally invariant field theories which are continuum limits of statistical mechanics systems where an interface can already be identified in the discrete setting due to boundary conditions .",
    "statistical mechanics relies on the computation of partition functions , and in the case at hand , the partition function when an initial segment of the interface is fixed is ( up to normalization ) the probability that the interface starts with this initial segment .",
    "changing the boundary conditions changes the partition function i.e. the distribution of the interface .",
    "the ratio of two such partition functions for the same initial segment of interface then appears as a discrete version of a radon - nykodim derivative , and indeed a slight extension of the arguments in @xcite yields the fact the ratio of partition functions is a martingale when the initial segment gets larger .",
    "a discrete partition function in an arbitrary geometry is hard to compute , to say the least .",
    "however the conformally invariant continuum limit ( when it exists ) is much more accessible .",
    "its relation to the discrete system involves removing certain divergences , and the limit in arbitrary geometry ( pieces of the boundary are sles with some change of boundary conditions at the tip ) can be quite singular .",
    "but ratios of partition functions behave smoothly exactly when one variant of interface involved is absolutely continuous with respect to the other , and the limiting ratio is expected to be the radon - nykodim derivative for the corresponding probability measures in the continuum .",

    "@xmath331 is a brownian motion , and the other building blocks in the formula for @xmath287 are of bounded variation ( i.e. do not contribute to @xmath332 terms in @xmath333 ) , so that @xmath334 then girsanov s theorem yields the stochastic differential equation of dipolar sle : @xmath335 which coincides with the already obtained formula . from this viewpoint ,",
    "the appearance of a logarithmic derivative in the drift is totally natural , and comparison with the initial formula implies an amusing relationship between the partition function @xmath336 and any conformal map @xmath337 mapping the upper - half plane to the strip @xmath37 to @xmath108 and @xmath338 to @xmath110 ( two such maps differ by an additive constant ) : @xmath339 is @xmath304-independent .    the second one is to look at the inverse ratio @xmath340 this time cft ensures that this is a martingale of dipolar sle . assuming that dipolar is absolutely continuous with respect to chordal i.e. that @xmath331 is a brownian motion plus a drift , this drift is fixed by the martingale property .",
    "of course the result is in agreement with the other approaches .",
    "the computation is more painful because one needs to look at the second order term in ito s formula .",
    "however , there is one benefit : only the martingale property is used , and not the fact that the ratio is a radon - nykodim derivative .",
    "indeed one could replace the ratio @xmath341 by any correlation function of dipolar sle in @xmath342 with hitting interval @xmath46 $ ] , which is again a tautological martingale , to compute the drift .",
    "this second strategy was used in @xcite to get the form of the stochastic differential system describing multiple sle s , and in @xcite to give the conformal field theory approach to sle(@xmath343 s ) and generalizations thereof . indeed , the martingale used in section [ sec : sw ] is the simplest partition function describing the effect of marked points ( in physics language , these could be impurities ) on sle interfaces and was identified as such in @xcite . from the cft viewpoint , this partition function leads to an sle@xmath4 tautological martingale by a general argument , and no explicit computation is required .      take a probability space with a filtration @xmath271 and an event @xmath344 such that @xmath345 }   \\neq 0 $ ] and let @xmath346}$ ] be the probability and expectation on @xmath347 obtained by conditioning @xmath147 on @xmath120 .    if @xmath348 is a random variable , @xmath349 } } { { { \\mathbf e}\\left [ \\mathbf{1}_j \\right]}}.$ ] in particular , if @xmath348 is @xmath350 measurable @xmath351}={{\\mathbf e}\\left [ { { \\mathbf e}\\left [ y\\mathbf{1}_j| \\mathcal{f}_s \\right ] } \\right]}={{\\mathbf e}\\left [ y{{\\mathbf",

    "+ again , the processes @xmath358 and @xmath285 are differentiable with respect to @xmath57 so that in the equation @xmath359 only the variation of @xmath360 with respect to @xmath105 contributes to @xmath289 and we find @xmath361 : the drift is again the variation of the appropriate free energy with respect to the starting point of the curve .",
    "in this paper we have shown that if @xmath1 , conditioning dipolar sle to hit a subinterval yields dipolar sle@xmath3 towards that subinterval . as a limiting case , conditioning dipolar sle@xmath3 to hit at a point yields chordal sle@xmath3 .",
    "we have also shown that these properties characterize the value @xmath1 by computing explicitly the drift term that arises when dipolar sle@xmath362 for general @xmath2 is conditioned to hit a subinterval .",
    "this drift term corresponds to some sle@xmath4 .",
    "we have shown that this drift can be computed by standard martingale techniques or by conformal field theory inspired methods .",
    "the relationship with lattice models leads to puzzling facts however .",
    "first of all , there is no obvious interpretation of the dipolar geometry for all lattice models .",
    "loop erased random walks , the ising model for spin clusters and percolation are among the few favorable cases .",
    "for loop erased random walks , the fact that conditioning of dipolar to hit a subinterval is dipolar to the subinterval is true almost by definition . for the ising model and percolation , the boundary condition on the hexagonal lattice are @xmath363 and @xmath364 on each side of the starting point and _ free _ on the boundary interval .",
    "it is easy to understand then that conditioning to hit a subinterval is a non trivial operation . but the case of self avoiding walks is irritating . the obvious candidate for the dipolar geometry would be to consider all the simple walks joining a boundary point to a boundary interval and weight each step by the critical fugacity @xmath365 .",
    "this prescription has the property that conditioning to end at a given point yields the chordal case .",
    "so we conclude that this naive definition can not converge to dipolar sle@xmath366 , most likely because it corresponds to non - conformally invariant boundary conditions .",
