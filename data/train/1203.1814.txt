    "experiments studying heavy ion collisions at ultrarelativistic energies aim to reproduce and study in the laboratory one of the anticipated phase transitions of the early universe , namely the qcd phase transition between partons and hadrons predicted by lattice qcd at a critical temperature of  160 - 180 mev and to map out the qcd phase diagram .    the star experiment at rhic with the help of recent important upgrades , including a full - barrel time - of - flight ( tof ) detector allowing for better particle identification",
    ", an upgraded daq and implementation of a high level trigger ( hlt ) system , has been able to accumulate a vast amount of high quality data from @xmath1 and au+au collisions .",
    "in addition star has taken data of au+au collisions performing a low energy scan covering the @xmath2 of 7.7 to 39 gev , aiming to discover a possible critical point , to study with precision the phase transition characteristics , and map out the phase diagram of qcd . in this paper",
    ", we present highlights from recent results of the star experiment , with a main focus on strangeness , charm and beauty production .",
    "open beauty ( @xmath3 ) and charm ( @xmath4 ) are prominent probes of the sqgp medium produced in central ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "star is the only experiment at rhic able to measure charm through direct charmed particle identification in addition to the measurement of charm and beauty through electrons originated from their decays .",
    "electrons are identified using the @xmath5 information measured with the time projection chamber ( tpc ) , the information of the electromagnetic calorimeter at high @xmath6 , and using the new tof detector at low @xmath6 .",
    "these detectors cover the midrapidity region and full azimuthal angle .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]     the nuclear modification factor of the @xmath7 meson in central with respect to peripheral au+au collisions at @xmath2=39 gev has been measured to show no significant suppression up to @xmath6 5 gev / c @xcite .",
    "the elliptic flow coefficient @xmath8 of @xmath7 meson , measured up to @xmath6= 2 gev / c at @xmath2=11.5 gev , shows a deviation from the @xmath8 of other hadrons in au+au collisions at @xmath2=11.5 gev ( figure  [ fig7 ] ) @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the difference of @xmath8 between particles and antiparticles is found to be weakly dependent on energy from the @xmath2=39 gev on , while it shows a significant deviation at energies lower than @xmath2=11.5 gev ( figure  [ fig6 ] ( left panel ) ) , which increases with decreasing energy @xcite .",
    "another interesting effect of a deviation at small energies is observed in the proton and antiproton slope @xmath9 of the @xmath10 flow coefficient of the protons and antiprotons at mid - rapidity as a function of beam energy at @xmath2=11.5 gev below which the proton slope changes sign , while the antiproton slope remains negative @xcite .",
    "furthermore , star has measured dynamical fluctuations of several particle ratios on an event - by - event basis in bes searching for a possible critical point .",
    "the @xmath11 dynamical fluctuations from star show no significant energy dependence in au+au collisions from @xmath2=7.7 to 200 gev @xcite .",
    "another remarkable result has been achieved by star while measuring the higher moments ( variance @xmath12 , skewness s and kurtosis @xmath13 ) of net - proton distributions in search for the qcd critical point .",
    "in particular the moment products @xmath13@xmath12 and s@xmath14 of net - proton distributions in most central au+au collisions ( figure  [ fig6 ] ( right panel ) ) are consistent with lattice qcd and hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) model calculations between @xmath2= 62.4 and 200 gev , while the results are smaller than the hrg model estimates at lower energies ( at @xmath2=7.7 , 11.5 , 39 gev ) @xcite .",
    "the star experiment at rhic has entered a new era of high precision and high statistics measurements with the help of recent major upgrades in particular the addition of a barrel tof detector , a data acquisition upgrade and a high level trigger . the highly enhanced data statistics and the new identification capabilities",
    "lead to a number of new striking results .",
    "star studies the properties of the new state of matter discovered at rhic , the strongly interacting quark gluon plasma measuring a+a collisions at the top rhic energy and accessing low baryochemical potential of about 20 mev .",
    "furthermore , star is exploring the qcd phase structure searching for a possible critical point and the phase boundary performing a beam energy scan with au+au collisions .",
    "new upgrades coming up in particular the silicon heavy flavour tracker detector ( hft ) and the muon telescope detector ( mtd ) heading to data taking in 2014 will allow for high precision measurements of open heavy flavour , quarkonia and dimuon pairs towards significant discoveries in the coming years .",
