    "several natural and social processes are governed by competing interactions .",
    "often the interplay between opposite actions produces ordered phases and symmetry breaking events . for example , models based on competing interactions are able to explain lamellar phases in charged colloids @xcite , pattern formation in magnetic films , languimir monolayers and liquid crystals @xcite and some market behaviors @xcite . in living organisms",
    "there is an important example of these processes : the spatial orientation of eukaryotic cells @xcite called eukaryotic directional sensing .",
    "many eukaryotic cells are able to orient ( polarize ) for moving along directions after an external stimulation .",
    "this process is fundamental for important biological functions like morphogenesis of organs and tissues , wound healing , immune response , social behaviors of some amoeboid cells .",
    "the process of orientation takes place on the cell membrane where the pattern formation of domains of two different enzymes determines a symmetry breaking which triggers the directional sensing @xcite .",
    "pattern formation occurs as a response to an external stimulation , usually a chemical signal activating specific receptors on the cell surface , enhanced by a cascade of chemical reactions leading to the cell polarization ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "experimental observations @xcite suggest that the domain formation is a consequence of self - organization of molecular patches .",
    "let us briefly summarize the biological mechanism of directional sensing .",
    "it can be explained in term of the interplay between two enzymes : pten ( phosphatase and tesin homolog ) and pi3k ( phosphatidylinotisol 3-kinase ) .",
    "this interplay is mediated by two lipids : the pip@xmath1 ( phosphatidylinotisol bisphosphate ) and the pip@xmath2 ( phosphatidylinotisol trisphosphate ) . before stimulation ,",
    "the cell membrane is populated only by the pten enzyme with its product pip@xmath1 but , when the external chemoattractant is switched on , the enzyme pi3k goes from cytoplasm to the cell membrane and binds to receptors .",
    "then , the interplay between the two enzymes takes place : the pi3k catalyzes pip@xmath1 in pip@xmath2 and pten catalyzes pip@xmath2 in pip@xmath1 .",
    "the enzymes can bind to the respective lipid products which diffuse over the membrane .",
    "enzymes can unbind from membrane and quickly diffuse in cytoplasm binding again in another place of the membrane .",
    "catalysis and lipides diffusion mediate an effective short - range attraction between enzymes of the same type .",
    "the quick diffusion of enzymes in the cytoplasm mediates a long range interaction .",
    "the combination of these actions produces the phase separation of a pi3k rich zone and a pten rich zone .",
    "the natural framework to treat the process , from a physical point of view , is the statistical physics of phase separation , which is useful to understand and describe in synthetic way the behavior of many complex systems that give rise to organization and pattern formation @xcite .",
    "the spatial organization phenomena described above have the characteristic of self - organized phase separation processes , where the cell state , driven by an external field , decays into the coexistence of two chemical phases , spatially localized in different regions .",
    "it was shown recently , by monte carlo simulation in a lattice gas model @xcite , that the phenomenology of directional sensing can be obtained by using an effective free energy .",
    "a similar point of view was used in the recent papers of gamba et al . @xcite .",
    "the remarkable physical characteristic of the process is that the orientation is possible for a wide range of external chemical attractant @xcite .",
    "namely , the phase coexistence and separation is possible for different values of an external field . in the lattice gas model @xcite , a long range repulsion , derived from the interaction with a finite cytosolic reservoir of total enzymes and the interaction with an external field , modelling the action of the chemical attractant ,",
    "give rise to coexistence for an interval of values of the external field .",
    "a short - range attraction between enzymes , derived from their catalytic actions on lipids and diffusion , gives rise to a coarsening process which produces phase separation .",
    "a similar mechanism operates in some econophysics models @xcite based on two major conflicting interactions in economy , the tendency of a trader to follow the actions of his neighbors and the tendency to follow the actions of the minority . in the language of magnetic systems , which we will use throughout this paper , the first tendency can be modelled by a short - range ferromagnetic interaction , while the second one by an antiferromagnetic long range interaction .    inspired by the mechanism of eukaryotic directional sensing and motivated by its wide applicability , here we present the analytical treatment of a system with competing short - range attraction and long - range repulsion , under the action of a uniform external field .",
    "this is done in the framework of the time dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) theory for the evolution of the order parameter .",
    "the analytical tractability of the dynamics is achieved considering a vector order parameter in the limit of an infinite number of components ( large @xmath0 limit ) @xcite .",
    "the equations of motion are derived in the scheme of non conserved order parameter , corresponding to the absence of local concentration of enzymes .",
    "the large @xmath0 limit is a powerful method to obtain analytical results , nevertheless it is necessary to keep in mind some important differences with the nonlinear models usually employed in the description of phase ordering when the order parameter is a scalar , such as kinetic ising models or the tdgl with @xmath3 interaction  @xcite .",
    "the basic difference is in the mechanism of equilibration after a symmetric quench below the critical point . in the nonlinear models the system responds to the dynamical instability by the formation and growth , through coarsening , of domains of the ordered phases",
    "this leads to the development of a bimodal probability distribution for the local magnetization , which eventually ought to evolve into the symmetric mixture of the two possible broken symmetry ordered phases  @xcite .",
    "this we call an _ ordering process_. in the large @xmath0 limit , instead , the development of a bimodal distribution , and therefore ordering , is not possible , since , as it will be clear below , the system is effectively linearized and the statistics are gaussian",
    ". then , the response to the dynamical instability takes place through the development of macroscopic fluctuations in the most unstable fourier component of the order parameter , through a process which is formally identical to the one leading to the formation of the condensate in the low temperature phase of the ideal bose gas .",
    "we refer to this equilibration mechanism as _ condensation of fluctuations_. the differences between the two equilibration processes have been investigated in detail in ref .",
    ".    the remarkable feature of the large @xmath0 limit , and the reason for its wide use , is that despite the considerable difference in the physical processes of equilibration , the phenomenology of the observables of interest , such as correlation functions and response functions , is the same as in the nonlinear models , apart for obvious quantitative discrepancies , like the values of exponents or the shape of scaling functions .",
    "the typical example is that of the equal time structure factor , which displays dynamical scaling and the growth of the bragg peak in the large @xmath0 limit  @xcite , exactly as in the nonlinear models .",
    "it is , then , matter of interpretation in one case to read the growth of the bragg peak as revealing domain coarsening and , in the other , condensation of fluctuations .",
    "there is , by now , a vast body of literature documenting the robustness of the large @xmath0 limit in reproducing the phenomenology of phase ordering in a large variety of models , warranting to overlook the distinction between ordering and condensation , as we shall do in this paper , when one is interested in the main qualitative features of the process .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we carry out the large @xmath0 limit on the tdgl model for a vector order parameter , deriving the basic equations . in section iii",
    "we study the equilibrium properties of the system , obtaining the phase diagram in the temperature and external field plane , parameterized by the strength of the long - range repulsion .",
    "this delimits the region of parameters where condensation or , equivalently , phase coexistence and separation are possible .",
    "section iv is devoted to the study the time behavior of the average value of the order parameter ( magnetization ) and of the correlation function .",
    "we recall that in the scalar case the magnetization represents the concentration difference between the two species of enzymes . concluding remarks are presented in section v.",

    "the angular brackets denote the average over both the initial condition and the thermal noise . in the following",
    "we shall take a reference frame with the @xmath18-axis along the longitudinal direction .",
    "assuming , next , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and comparing terms of the same order of magnitude in @xmath0 , to leading order we get the pair of equations = - m + ( h - v_v d m ) [ 1.8bis ] and = - + _ [ 1.10bis ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the following rescaled quantities m(x , t ) = m(x , t)/n^1/2,h(x , t ) = h(x , t)/n^1/2 .",

    "<S> we present a theoretical study of a system with competing short - range ferromagnetic attraction and a long - range anti - ferromagnetic repulsion , in the presence of a uniform external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the interplay between these interactions , at sufficiently low temperature , leads to the self - tuning of the magnetization to a value which triggers phase coexistence , even in the presence of the external field . </S>",
    "<S> the investigation of this phenomenon is performed using a ginzburg - landau functional in the limit of an infinite number of order parameter components ( large @xmath0 model ) . the scalar version of the model is expected to describe the phase separation taking place on a cell surface when this is immersed in a uniform concentration of chemical stimulant . </S>",
    "<S> a phase diagram is obtained as function of the external field and the intensity of the long - range repulsion . </S>",
    "<S> the time evolution of order parameter and of the structure factor in a relaxation process are studied in different regions of the phase diagram . </S>"
