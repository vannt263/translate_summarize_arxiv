    "cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) has got much progress over past several years @xcite .",
    "people have achieved various optical and microwave cavities , with which some remarkable quantum phenomena have been demonstrated , such as strong coupling of a single atom with a single photon @xcite , quantum logic gating between two atomic qubits @xcite , photonic blocking @xcite , efficient generation of single photons @xcite , and so on .    in the present work",
    ", we will investigate how to realize a grover search with more than three qubits by cavity qed .",
    "the grover search , as one of the most frequently mentioned quantum algorithms , could effectively exemplifies the potential speed - up offered by quantum computers @xcite .",
    "recently , many authors have dedicated themselves to the search algorithm by adiabatic evolution methods @xcite or nonadiabatic scheme @xcite .",
    "although achievement of these schemes needs stringent conditions and demanding techniques @xcite , they are really wonderful ideas . on the other hand ,",
    "some authors had addressed the effect of decoherence @xcite , noise @xcite , and gate imperfection or errors @xcite on the efficiency of quantum algorithms .",
    "we also noticed that , there had been intensive interests in achieving grover search algorithm theoretically and experimentally by using nmr systems @xcite , trapped ions @xcite , linear optical elements @xcite , cavity  qed @xcite , and superconducting meso - circuits @xcite .",
    "our interest is in the experimental feasibility of grover search by a microwave cavity .",
    "a recent work @xcite , with two of the authors joined in , showed a three - qubit grover search implementation in a microwave cavity . as it makes use of the resonant interaction of the atoms with the cavity mode and consideres the detrimental influence from the cavity decay ,",
    "the implementation of @xcite is close to the reach of current technique .",
    "however , that scheme is hard to be extended to the case with more than three qubits due to the method @xcite used there . in the present work , we will show that , after some modification of the method in @xcite , we could accomplish a high - fidelity conditional phase flip ( cpf ) for many atomic qubits flying through a microwave cavity , based on which an @xmath0-qubit @xmath1 grover search might be achieved in a straightforward way .",
    "the main idea is that , we make a smart qubit encoding on the atomic levels , and send the atoms through a microwave cavity for resonant interaction .",
    "as long as we could exactly control the interaction time and the trajectories of the flying atoms , we may accomplish the @xmath0-qubit cpf gate by one step of implementation , based on which we could efficiently carry out an @xmath0-qubit grover search with high fidelity .",
    "however , as the grover search with more than two qubits works only probabilistically and also as our one - step implementation of many - qubit cpf gate intrinsically owns imperfection , the situation in our case is much more complicated than in two - qubit case . to make our scheme more realistic",
    ", we involve the cavity decay in our treatment , and as done in @xcite , we will try to present some analytical expressions for the state evolution during our implementation . as a result",
    ", we could explicitly assess how well a grover search is made subject to these disadvantageous factors .",
    "as described in @xcite , we consider the resonant interaction of @xmath0 three - level atoms with a single - mode cavity . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , the three levels can be described by @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 , in which the subscript @xmath5 means the @xmath5th atom , the states @xmath6 are excited states and @xmath2 , @xmath3 are ground states . as @xmath7 and @xmath4 are coupled in resonance by the cavity mode , the states  @xmath2 are not involved in the interaction with the cavity mode throughout our treatment .  we encode the first qubit @xmath8 @xmath9 on @xmath10 ( @xmath11 and other qubits @xmath12 @xmath13 on @xmath14 @xmath15 with @xmath16 .",
    "considering the cavity with weak decay , which implies no photon actually leaking out of the cavity during our implementation , we may write the hamiltonian in units of @xmath17 as,@xmath18 where @xmath19 is the coupling constant of the @xmath20th atom to the cavity mode , and the atomic spin operators for raising and lowering are @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively .",
    "@xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of the cavity mode .",
    "we will first consider an implementation of @xmath0-qubit cpf under cavity dissipation , based on which an @xmath0-qubit grover search would be achieved in the next section .    assuming the initial atomic state in @xmath25 and the cavity initially in the vacuum state @xmath26",

    "generally speaking , provided that initial state of the system has been prepared in an average superposition state @xmath76 grover search can be depicted as the iterative operation @xmath77 by at least @xmath78 times for finding the marked state @xmath79 with an optimal probability@xmath80 where the quantum phase gate @xmath81 ( with @xmath82 being the identity matrix ) plays an important role to invert the amplitude of the marked state , and the diffusion transform @xmath83 is defined as @xmath84 @xmath85 @xmath86 considering the qubit subspace spanned by \\{@xmath10 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 ... @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 } , to make a grover search , we could construct following transformation,@xmath94 where @xmath95 ( with superscript @xmath96 denoting @xmath0-qubit case and @xmath97 denoting @xmath0 elements ) and the hadamard gate in our computational subspace is given by@xmath98 in the case of @xmath0 qubits , eq .",
    "( 7 ) implies that the diffusion transform @xmath99 is always unchanged no matter which state is to be searched .",
    "the only change is the operator @xmath100 for different marked states .",
    "based on the cpf gate constructed in last section , we have @xmath101 from which we could achieve the gate @xmath102 as,@xmath103 where @xmath104 with @xmath105 and @xmath106 to achieve @xmath107 , we will construct the cpf gate @xmath108 for example , in the case of @xmath109 , the number of the involved quantum states is @xmath110 , and the operation is to label a marked state by @xmath111 with @xmath112 one of the states from @xmath113 to carry out the ten - qubit grover search , we need two ten - qubit hadamard gates @xmath114 . based on the cpf gate marking the state @xmath115 we could construct other @xmath116 gates for the marking job by single - qubit rotations .",
    "for example,@xmath117 so with a state marked , and with the ten - qubit diffusion transform @xmath118  which is generated by combining two hadamard gates @xmath119 with @xmath120 ,",
    "a full grover search for ten qubits is available .",
    "let us consider a ten - qubit grover search for the marked state @xmath121 as an example .",
    "the rydberg atoms from the 1st to the 10th are input , as shown in fig .",
    "1 , with principal quantum numbers @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 denoting @xmath125 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 respectively . suppose the atoms initially prepared in a superposition @xmath128 .",
    "we plot in fig . 3 for the success rate of the grover search in different cases . as the grover search involving more than two qubits is intrinsically probabilistic , how to obtain an optimal search is a problem of interest .",
    "in contrast to the previous study for an ideal grover search @xcite , our analytical expressions along with some numerics could identify the optimal search under cavity decay and other imperfection due to gating .",
    "we know from fig .",
    "3 that , because of the cavity decay , the more iteration steps , the more detrimental effect from the cavity decay involved . as a result",
    ", we prefer to have less iteration steps for an optimal search . the detrimental effect from the cavity decay",
    "is also reflected in the figure that the maximum value of p is slightly lower in the case of larger decay rate .",
    "our cpf gating plays the essential role in our grover search scheme , which much reduces the implementation time compared to that by a series of two - qubit conditional gates and single - qubit gates @xcite .",
    "sec ii has shown that the cpf gating time only depends on the weakest coupling @xmath129 and the cavity decay rate @xmath130 but irrelevant to the qubit number .",
    "so our scheme could keep constant implementation time no matter how many atoms are involved , which favors a large - scale qip . as a result , if we suppose the single - qubit rotation takes negligible time compared to the cpf gating , then our grover search could be carried out by a constant time irrelevant to the qubit number . specifically , assuming @xmath131 khz @xcite@xmath80 @xmath132 khz@xmath80 and @xmath133 we have @xmath134 @xmath135 , which is much shorter than either the cavity decay time , i.e. , @xmath136 ms , or the rydberg atomic lifetime @xmath137 ms @xcite .",
    "however , for a grover search , the operation @xmath138 has to be made for several times depending on the specific search task . in the case of @xmath139 the total required time for a grover search would be about @xmath140\\times$ ] @xmath141 @xmath142 ms which is comparable to the cavity decay time .",
    "as shown in fig.3 , our numerics shows that the iteration steps for optimal search are @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 respectively , in the case of @xmath146 @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "since the operation time @xmath149 varies very little in the case of weak cavity dissipation with respect to the ideal case , the less iteration steps under dissipation would definitely lead to reduction of our implementation time .",
    "straightforward calculation shows that the required time for an optimal search are  @xmath142 ms , @xmath150 ms , and @xmath151 ms , respectively , in the case of @xmath146 @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "it is of importance to have a fast implementation of grover search in view of decoherence .",
    "but if we seriously consider the values in above calculation , we could find that @xmath152 and @xmath148 correspond to dissipation time of 4 ms and 2 ms , respectively . as a result , to have a fast implementation with our scheme",
    ", we must increase the coupling strengths @xmath153 and @xmath129 by at least ten times@xmath80 which makes sure the required implementation time to be much shorter than the dissipation time .    in current microwave cavity experiments",
    "@xcite , we may consider the interaction between atoms and the cavity mode by @xmath154 @xcite , where @xmath153 is the coupling strength at the cavity center , @xmath155 is the distance of the atom away from the cavity center , and @xmath156 and @xmath157 are the wavelength and the waist of the cavity mode , respectively . to meet the condition of @xmath158 ,  we may send the first atom going through the cavity along y axis deviating from the nodes by @xmath159 , but other atoms through the antinodes . specifically , for the n input atoms ( suppose n being an even number for simplicity ) , we should have the tracks of the atomic movement as @xmath160 , @xmath161 .... , @xmath162 . moreover , with current cavity qed techniques , the design in fig .",
    "1 could be realized by 50 separate microwave cavities with each ramsey zone located by a cavity . since each microwave cavity",
    "is employed to carry out a ten - qubit phase gate @xmath163 , the cavities should be identical .",
    "while searching for different states , we employ different single - qubit operations .",
    "so the ramsey zones should be long enough to finish the necessary single - qubit operations .",
    "however , it is highly challenging with current experimental technology to simultaneously send many rydberg atoms through a cavity with precise tracks and velocities although two rydberg atoms going through a microwave cavity simultaneously have been achieved @xcite . here",
    "we assess the infidelity due to the imperfection in atomic velocity by a simple example below .",
    "consider the simple situation that the first atom moves a little bit slower in the cavity than other atoms , that is , @xmath164 , @xmath165 , with @xmath166 .",
    "as shown in fig.4 with @xmath167 , we can see that the infidelity increases with both @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "in actual experiment , the situation is much more complicated . besides the diversity of atomic velocity",
    ", there will be other imperfections such as classical pulse imperfection , differences of the cavities , deflected atomic trajectories and so on .",
    "our simple estimate could show the importance of highly controllable movement of the atoms in implementing our scheme .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied many - qubit cpf gate in cavity qed under weak cavity dissipation , and explored the possibility of many - qubit grover search in a dissipative cavity qed system . as a theoretical work , like previous publication in cavity qed , e.g. , @xcite ,",
    "we have simplified the complexity in the realistic system , and tried to present some analytical expressions for the state evolution subject to the cavity decay .",
    "although we took an example involving ten qubits , our approach could also be easily used for three or four atomic qubits in cavity qed , which might be closer to experimental realization . on the other hand ,",
    "we have noticed experimentally achieved entanglement of six photons @xcite , eight trapped ions @xcite and twelve nmr ensemble qubits @xcite .",
    "so we also hope our idea could be extended to other systems , such as to trapped ions .",
    "furthermore , from above discussion , we have known the experimental difficulty for ten atomic qubits to be entangled and used for grover search by current cavity qed technique .",
    "nevertheless , we argue that our study would be useful for future qip experiments by microwave cavity .",
