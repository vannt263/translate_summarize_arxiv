    "tully - fisher ( tf ) surveys at cosmological distances provide a direct way to track the evolution in fundamental scaling relations of disk galaxies .",
    "such surveys permit , for example , the measurement of the disk size or luminosity evolution under the assumption that deviations from fiducial tf relations can be understood as photometric changes in constant - mass potentials .",
    "deviations from tf may also be produced by dynamical asymmetries due to instabilities , interactions , minor mergers , or slow and possibly lumpy mass - accretion .",
    "semi - analytic models of galaxy formation are able to reproduce the basic slope and scatter in the tf relationship at @xmath2 , yet most fail to recover the correct zero - point ( e.g. steinmetz & navarro , 1999 ) .",
    "we anticipate that in the future , however , the scatter in the tf relation will be a more useful diagnostic of how disks are assembled .",
    "the scatter about the tf relation should constrain the modes by which disks form , particularly if the nature of this scatter can be determined as a function of redshift . for example , are offsets from a fiducial tf relation accompanied by an increase in disk asymmetry ?",
    "0.15 in    -0.15 in    historically , tf surveys have targeted galaxies with photometric inclinations above 40 - 45@xmath3 in order to minimize errors in the corrected rotation velocities .",
    "hi kinematic estimates of inclination also have been difficult to measure below @xmath4 given the precision of hi maps in the past , as well as the intrinsic problems associated with flaring and warping of the outer parts of hi disks ( e.g. begeman , 1989 ) .",
    "we have recently acquired integral - field echelle spectroscopy with the wiyn telescope s densepak fiber - bundle of over a dozen , nearby disk galaxies ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "an example is shown in figure 1 . in",
    "as little as an hour apiece we have obtained high quality , h@xmath0 velocity fields at a precision of @xmath6 km / s over the inner 2 - 3 few scale lengths of each disk .",
    "moreover , we have been successful fitting single , inclined disks to these kinematic data ; residuals are typically @xmath73.5 km / s ( rms ) .",
    "the derived kinematic inclinations compare favorably to those estimated from inverting the optical - hi tf relation ( figure 2 , right panel ) .",
    "we estimate that the kinematic inclinations from wiyn / densepak h@xmath0 maps can be measured to better than 10% down to @xmath8 ; the dominant error appears to arise from non - circular motions in the disks ( figure 3 ) .",
    "the excellent correlation in figure 2 ( right panel ) indicates , however , that our error estimates may be substantially too conservative ! the ability to study galaxies at low , but precisely known inclinations is of interest for tf work because ( i ) detailed disk structure can be viewed with little projection , and ( ii ) the vertical component of the disk velocity ellipsoid is favorably projected for measurement ( potentially enabling estimates of both total and disk mass ) .",
    "0.15 in    -0.15 in    by combining two - dimensional , kinematic information with optical and near - infrared images of disks , one can explore in detail the asymmetry of disks .",
    "the kinematic exploration has long been the domain of hi studies ( e.g. richter & sanchisi 1994 , haynes et al . 1998 , swaters et al . 1998 ) , but now this can be done routinely in hii and folded more directly into optical studies of photometric asymmetries ( e.g. zaritsky & rix 1997 ; kornreich et al .",
    "1998 ; conselice et al .",
    "the next step , of course , is to be able to make comparable kinematic measurements for the _ stellar _ component of disks .",
    "comparisons of the kinematic to photometric inclination and position angles can yield constraints on the intrinsic ellipticity of disks . as a simple test , we compare inclination angles in figure 2",
    ". if disks are intrinsically elliptic at the 10% level ( a limit inferred from the scatter in the tf relation ; franx & de zeeuw , 1992 ) , then there will be an overabundance of apparently ( photometrically ) inclined galaxies which are kinematically close to face - on .",
    "the small sample studied to date is consistent with intrinsic disk ellipticities @xmath910% .",
    "more powerful constraints lie in extracting apparent ellipticities relative to kinematic major and minor axes ( andersen et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "velocity fields of distant disk galaxies would provide direct evidence of their evolving dynamical states .",
    "however , the combined distance effects of shrinking size , cosmological surface - brightness dimming , and redshifting of spectral features into spectral regions of higher terrestrial sky - backgrounds makes such observations daunting . assuming that one samples the same physical scale at all distances , the product of the telescope diameter and observing - time@xmath10 goes roughly as @xmath11 from the ground , in the background limit , at high spectral resolution , and at @xmath12 ( where apparent size is a weak function of redshift ) .",
    "only modest gains ( @xmath13 in the exponent ) are made from space .    a zero - point for this telescope - diameter ",
    "redshift relation can be set from the keck observations of rotation curves at @xmath14 , taken in several hours with a 1 arcsec wide slit ( vogt et al .",
    ". a factor of 3 higher spatial resolution would just resolve galaxies at cosmological distances at the equivalent of one disk scale - length for a typical disk today . in the background limit",
    ", one would then require a three times larger aperture at constant exposure time , i.e. a 30-m telescope .",
    "other gains can come from ( i ) improved instrument throughput , and ( ii ) enhancing surface - brightness contrast by resolving bright , star - forming knots in distant galaxy disks via high - order adaptive optics ( koo , 1999 ) .",
    "the latter is not applicable , however , for the study of stellar motions in disks , which are of particular interest for understanding asymmetries in disk mass distributions .",
