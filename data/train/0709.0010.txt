    "<S> it was proposed an unified scheme to generate ghz states , w states , and cluster states of four distant atoms that are trapped separately in leaky cavities . </S>",

    "<S> in ref.@xcite the authors proposed methods of fidelity estimation and entanglement verification to experimentally produce four - qubit cluster states .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , munhoz _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite investigated a cluster - type of four - qubit coherent states and its generation  using five qed cavities , two ramsey zones , a pair of two - level rydberg atoms , an external classical field plus atomic ionization detectors . in view of the interesting idea and its potential applications , in this report we will present an alternative and simplified scheme for its generation in the same qed cavity context . </S>",
    "<S> we employ a pair of qed bimodal cavities , a single two - level ( rydberg ) atom and a dispersive atom - field interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the simplicity of our scheme makes it attractive experimentally due to its feasibility in the present status of qed technology raimond01,gleyzes_nat07 . </S>",
    "<S> this proposal requires the experimental setup shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the source _ s _ ejects rubidium atoms which are velocity selected and prepared in the circular rydberg state , one at a time , by appropriated laser beams in box the _ b_. the relevant atomic levels @xmath1 and @xmath2 , with the principal quantum numbers 50 and 51 , provide the atomic transition of @xmath3 @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> _ r@xmath5 _ , _ r@xmath6 _ and _ r@xmath7 _ stand for ramsey zones which perform a resonant @xmath8 pulse on the @xmath9 transition . </S>",
    "<S> the two bimodal high - q superconducting cavities @xmath10 and @xmath11 are fabry - perot resonators made of two spherical niobium mirrors with two orthogonally polarized tem@xmath12 modes separated by @xmath13 @xmath14 having the same gaussian geometry ( waist @xmath15 ) , and photon damping times of @xmath16 @xcite ; @xmath17 stands for the microwave generator coupled to each cavity , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are atomic detectors . </S>",
    "<S> these cavities are prepared at low temperature ( @xmath20 @xmath21 ) to reduce the average number of thermal photons ; before starting the experiment the thermal field is erased @xcite .    to generate the cluster states in the four mode of the two bimodal cavities we need to make two operations : i ) </S>",
    "<S> the first one occurs when the atom crosses the ramsey zones r@xmath5 , r@xmath6 , and r@xmath7 and interacts with the * *  * * classical fields resonant to the atomic transition between the states @xmath22 and @xmath1 , with intensities adjusted to produce a @xmath23 rotation in the atomic space , i.e. , @xmath24ii ) the second operation occurs in @xmath10 and @xmath11 and involves dispersive atom - field interactions with these cavity modes , one at a time , in such a way that the atom crossing the cavity in the excited state @xmath25 ( @xmath26 produces a negative ( positive ) phase - shift in the desired mode state . </S>",
    "<S> the dispersive interaction is described by the effective atom - field hamiltonian raimond01 , @xmath27 ,   \\label{disp}\\]]where @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) is the boson annihilation ( creation ) operator for mode @xmath30 , with @xmath31 for the cavity @xmath10 ; the same is valid for the cavity @xmath11 with @xmath32 ; @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the atomic projectors , @xmath35 stands for the vacuum rabi coupling with mode @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the detuning between atomic transition and the mode @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> although the cavity has two modes , the frequency splitting of @xmath13 @xmath14 between them ensures the atom being efficiently coupled only to a single mode @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then , using the stark effect we choose the detuning with the mode @xmath30 which will interact in dispersive regime , i.e. , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 stands for the average photon number in the cavity . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution operator associated with eq.([disp ] ) reads @xmath40where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the interaction time of the atom and the field in mode @xmath43__. _ _    now we discuss our procedure to generate the cluster coherent state inside a two bimodal cavities . initially , </S>",
    "<S> all the modes @xmath44 and @xmath45 of @xmath10 and @xmath46 and @xmath47 of @xmath11 are prepared in a coherent state @xmath48 whereas the atom is prepared in the ground or excited states . </S>",
    "<S> the initial and final atomic states determine the type of cluster state obtained . before entering in the first cavity </S>",
    "<S> the atom crosses a ramsey zone r@xmath5 and the atomic state evolves to the superposition ( zre ) and ( [ zrg ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the state of the whole system can be written as@xmath49where the sign @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) comes from the atom initially prepared in the excited ( ground ) state . </S>",
    "<S> after that it enters the first cavity ( detuning @xmath52 ) and interacts dispersively with the mode @xmath44 during a time @xmath53 to produce a phase shift @xmath54 . at the cavity axis , </S>",
    "<S> a stark effect is applied to the atom tuning it dispersively ( @xmath55 ) with the mode @xmath45 for a time @xmath56 .  as result the state of the whole system </S>",
    "<S> becomes @xmath57when the atom emerges from the first cavity it crosses another ramsey zone r@xmath58 , tuned to the transitions ( [ zre ] ) and ( [ zrg ] ) . in this way we obtain </S>",
    "<S> @xmath59next the atom enters the cavity @xmath11 and interacts dispersively with the modes @xmath46 and @xmath47 , in the same way as found in @xmath60 so the whole state results@xmath61now , the atom crosses another ramsey zone r@xmath7 , leading the whole system to the state@xmath62 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    finally the atomic detection projects the state of the two cavities in one of the following four - qubit coherent cluster states @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 @xmath66 where we have omitted the subscripts of the modes ; the superscripts in eqs.([cc1])-([cc4 ] ) indicate in which way the atomic state is prepared / detected . note that the cluster states @xmath67 , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 correspond to @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively , found in @xcite . in the same way , other types of cluster states appearing in @xcite can be obtained by convenient choices of initial states . </S>",
    "<S> for example , from the initial state @xmath75 we obtain the cluster state @xmath76 given in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we calculate the total time @xmath77 spent for the generation of the four - qubit cluster coherent states . </S>",
    "<S> first , note that @xmath78 must be chosen in a way that the cluster coherent states ( [ cc1]-[cc4 ] ) be orthogonal and this choice determines the value of detuning @xmath79 satisfying the dispersive condition @xmath80 . setting @xmath81 leads to @xmath82 and @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> now , using recent experimental data @xcite for the central rabi frequency @xmath84 ( with @xmath31 ) one obtains the interaction time @xmath85 to produce a phase shift @xmath23 in the state of mode @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> this requires the atomic velocity @xmath86 to get an effective atom - field interaction time when taking into account the variation of the rabi frequency due to the atomic motion across the gaussian cavity mode . </S>",
    "<S> the selected atomic velocity belongs to the typical interval available in laboratories @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> the total time required for the interaction of the atom with the four modes in the two cavities is @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme presented here can be mathematically generalized for hight orders of particles in cluster coherent state simply increasing more cavities in the experimental apparatus . </S>",
    "<S> however one should take into account the total time to accomplish the procedure and like this to count the decoherence effects in the field state in the cavity , that in those cases can be important .    </S>",
    "<S> till now we have considered all calculations in an ideal experiment . in a realistic case the effect of velocity spread , detection efficiency , and dissipation should be taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> first , we know that the atomic velocity determines the pulse @xmath89 in the ramsey zones and the phase shift @xmath90 in the cavity mode , so any atomic velocity spread produces uncertainties in the values of @xmath89 and @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the fidelity comparing the ideal cluster and real cluster states , obtained with the influence of the velocity spread included . for experimental velocity spreads @xmath91 @xmath92 </S>",
    "<S> m / s @xcite the fidelity is @xmath93 as showed in fig.([fid ] ) ; second , there is no problem with respect to detector efficiency since the scheme works with a single atom ; third , the total time @xmath77  of experiment ( @xmath94 @xmath95 , neglecting the spatial separation between cavities ) is much lesser than photon damping times ( @xmath96 and atomic radiative times ( @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99 for rydberg atoms ) ; so , we will neglect dissipation and the scheme may be experimentally feasible in the realm of microwave .    in summary , inspired on a previous work @xcite  we have presented an alternative scheme to generate a four - qubit cluster of coherent states based on the potential applications for quantum computing @xcite.cavity qed is widely believed to be an excellent system for quantum gate operations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the our method to generate the cluster coherent state is suitable for applications in the scheme for cluster - state quantum computing of the ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it employs two bimodal qed cavities and a single two - level rydberg atom , constituting an economic version compared with @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we have considered the variation of the rabi frequency due to the atomic motion across the gaussian cavity mode : it results in the total time of experiment @xmath100 , smaller than that in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the success probability to get a specific cluster state of the family in eqs.([cc1])-([cc4 ] ) is @xmath101 , instead of the @xmath102 found in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we have taken advantage of a recent result by the haroche s group @xcite , allowing us to neglect the decoherence of the state during the generation process . </S>"
