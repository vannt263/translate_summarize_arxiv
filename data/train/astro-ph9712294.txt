    "intraday flux variations are a well known characteristic common to bl lacertae objects , optically violently variable quasars and flat spectrum radio - loud quasars ( wagner & witzel 1995 ) . theoretical explanations for these variations invoke relativistic shocks propagating down a jet and interacting with irregularities in the flow ( qian et al 1991 ; marscher , gear & travis 1992 ) , or numerous flares or hotspots on the surface of the accretion disk believed to surround the central engine ( mangalam & wiita 1993 ) . rapid variations in radio - quiet quasars were not established until searches for optical intra - night variabilities pioneered by gopal - krishna , sagar & wiita ( 1993 ) in an effort to constrain both the models for the origin of the variability and also the nature of the nuclear energy source in agns .",
    "clear detection of low - amplitude optical microvariability were reported for a sample of bright radio - quiet qsos ( gopal - krishna , sagar & wiita 1995 ; sagar , gopal - krishna & wiita 1996 ) , favouring their origin in accretion disks around central massive blackholes .",
    "we have begun a complementary program to study the intra - night optical variability in qsos with broad absorption lines ( bal ) to probe the influence of the bal phenomena in the microvariabilty within the systems .",
    "since the bal systems belong primarily to the sample of radio - quiet qsos , and form a minor subset of it , a similarity in their short term light curves would reflect their origin from the same parent population .",
    "however , departures in their microvaribility behaviour from those of the parent population would be suggestive of a possible link to the bal phenomena , and its origin .    in this paper we present the results of our monitoring study for two bal qsos 0846 + 156 and 0856 + 172 chosen for our pilot programme , using the 2.3 m vainu bappu telescope .",
    "section 2 presents the observations , the results are described in section 3 ; section 4 discusses our results .",
    "the bal qsos in the present study were chosen from the hewitt & burbidge ( 1987 ) catalog .",
    "the observations were carried out at the vainu bappu observatory , kavalur , using a tek @xmath4 ccd detector at the prime focus of the 2.3 m vainu bappu telescope .",
    "each ccd pixel corresponds to @xmath5 arcsec@xmath6 and the total sky area covered by the detector is about @xmath7  arcmin@xmath6 .",
    "the epadu for the system is 5.6 and read noise about 12 electrons .",
    "we report here the observations of qso 0846 + 156 ( @xmath8 ) and qso 0856 + 172 ( @xmath9 ) , observed on 1997 february 3 and 4 .",
    "both objects were observed in the @xmath10 band .",
    "several exposures , each of 600s integration time , were obtained for both the objects over a total period of @xmath11  hours .",
    "the sky conditions were non - photometric on both the nights and the seeing @xmath12  arcsec .",
    "the data were reduced using the iraf software package .",
    "all frames were bias subtracted using a mean bias value .",
    "flat - field correction was applied using a median twilight sky flat .",
    "aperture photometry of all the stars in the field was performed using concentric apertures of diameter 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 14 and 18 arcsec centered on the object .",
    "sky background was subtracted using values measured in an annulus of 3 arcsec at a radius of 10 arcsec from the center .",
    "based on a growth curve for the brighter stars in the frame , the 14 arcsec aperture was chosen .",
    "differential magnitudes were obtained following the method of howell , mitchell & warnock ( 1988 ) and howell ( 1992 ) , choosing a bright star in the field as the comparison and a nearby check star with magnitude similar to that of the qso .",
    "the qso and the check star being faint , the magnitude measured from the 14 arcsec aperture is severely affected by the background and read noise . hence , we use the magnitude from the 4 arcsec aperture , correcting for the photons from the source outside this aperture ( upto 14 arcsec ) using a correction factor estimated based on the brighter stars .",
    "this source was observed on 1997 february 3 for @xmath13 hours , with a signal - to - noise ratio of 5080 .",
    "the differential magnitudes with respect of the comparison star ( qso - c@xmath14 ) are shown in figure 1 .",
    "also shown in the figure are the differential magnitudes of the comparison and check star ( c@xmath14-c@xmath15 ) .",
    "the scatter in the individual measurements shown in the figure were estimated following howell et al ( 1988 ) and howell ( 1992 ) .",
    "the qso light curve reveals a variability which could be periodic .",
    "there also appears to be a gradual decline in the mean magnitude level , estimated as a mean line through the observed points , by about 0.05 magnitude .",
    "this trend is not seen in the light curve of the check star , which shows an overall variation of @xmath16  mag , similar to the scatter in the measurements .",
    "we have tested for intrinsic variability in the qso following the statistical method of howell et al ( 1988 ) , and find instrinsic variability in the source at a 95% confidence level .",
    "this source was observed on 1997 february 4 , also for nearly 3 hours , with a signal - to - noise ratio of 3050 . in figure 2",
    "we plot the differential magnitudes , along with the scatter in the individual measurements .",
    "this source also reveals a nearly periodic variability with a period @xmath17 min , and a gradual decline in the mean level by 0.15 magnitude . there is a sudden dip in the light curve by 1 magnitude at ut 20.5 .",
    "there is a slow drift in the ( c@xmath14-c@xmath15 ) light curve by 0.04 magnitude , while no drastic change is seen at ut 20.5 .",
    "the statistical test indicates intrinsic variability at a 95% confidence level .",
    "optical variability in bal qsos has been established on timescales of the order of years . in his review paper turnshek ( 1988 )",
    "notes that the optical variability of bal qsos differs markedly from that of the non - bal radio - quiet sample .",
    "furthermore on these longer timescales , time variability has been observed in the strength of the bal features ( turnshek 1988 , barlow et al 1992 , hamann , barlow & junkkarinen 1997 ) by as much as a factor of few over timescales of @xmath18 year ( barlow et al 1992 , hamann et al 1997 ) .",
    "intra - night variability has not been reported since the previous studies were more suited for detecting long term variations .",
    "the observations reported here were specifically designed to look for the shorter time scale microvariability , limited only by the s / n consideration at the vbt .",
    "intra - night variability is clearly detected in both the bal qsos presented here .",
    "0846 + 156 shows variability with a maxmimum peak - to - peak variation of 5% , which could be periodic , while 0856 + 172 shows periodic variability on a time scale of 40 minutes with a maximum peak - to - peak variation of 9% .",
    "further , both objects show a gradual decline in their mean level by @xmath2 and @xmath3 magnitude , respectively , during the period of our observations ( 23 hours ) . the magnitude of microvariability observed in these two objects",
    "are slightly more than reported for the non - bal radio - quiet sample of gopal - krishna et al ( 1995 ) and sagar et al ( 1996 ) , which show variability of the order 35% .",
    "the radio - quiet sample also do not show any gradual rise / decline of the magnitude levels as seen here .",
    "the bal troughs fall within the @xmath10 band in 0846 + 156 , while they fall outside the @xmath10 band in 0856 + 172 , ruling out the possibility of the observed light curve variations being caused by variations in the strength of the bal features .",
    "this result is similar to the conclusion of barlow et al ( 1992 ) , who found the variation in the absorption equivalent widths in cso 203 are not a result of the changes in the broad band fluxes which are @xmath19% .",
    "the light curve variations observed in the two objects presented here are continuum variations as in the case of both the radio - quiet and the radio - loud objects .",
    "the observed variability may either be directly linked with the bal phenomena , or , the choice of the bal qso sample produces a selection of objects more conducive for time variability studies . in the former case of the variability being caused by the bal phenomena ,",
    "it is unclear how the absorbing clouds typically at a distance of @xmath20 pc from the central continuum source could produce variability on such a short time scale .",
    "neither a smoothly flowing bal wind ( hamann , korista & morris 1993 ) or clumpy bal clouds ( turnshek 1988 ) or stellar contrails from evolved stars in the nucleus ( scoville & norman 1995 ) can easily account for the observed microvariability .",
    "a more likely possibility appears to be that the intrinsic optical microvariability in the bal and the non - bal radio - quiet qsos is of the same origin , but their observability is more optimised in the case of the bal systems .",
    "such a scenario would , in principle , arise if the bal clouds participate in supersonic outflows from the polar regions of a blackhole + accretion disk system and are closely aligned to the line of sight to the observer . in such a case , the disc and all the associated variability phenomena on its surface such as flares , hot spots etc",
    "would be seen face on .",
    "thus the bals select the most advantageous orientation for viewing the variability phenomena and can explain the observed difference in the microvariability with respect to the parent radio - quiet population as an ` orientation effect . '    a most intriguing aspect of the present study appears to be the similarity in the observed light curves with those of the the bl lacertae objects ( miller & carini 1991 ; wagner et al 1991 ; carini 1991 ; wagner & witzel 1995 ) , which are flat spectrum radio - loud sources .",
    "the bl lacs show a similar decline in the mean light curve , with a suggestion of microvariability similar to the ones observed here for the bal qsos .",
    "for example : in the data presented by carini ( 1991 ) , oj 287 faded in brightness by @xmath21 magnitude in @xmath22 hours on one occasion , in addition to rapid variability .",
    "in addition to rapid variations , decline in the magnitude by @xmath23 magnitude has been detected in both bl lac and oq 530 ( miller & carini 1991 ) .",
    "recently becker et al ( 1997 ) have detected a flat spectrum radio - loud bal qso along with two other low ionisation bal quasars from a radio - selected quasar sample .",
    "the studies of the properties of the three objects suggest a trend of increasing radio luminosity with the amount of absorption to the quasar , leading them to suggest their objects could be transition objects evolving from radio - loud to radio - quiet bal systems as the qso emerges from an enshrouding material .",
    "these findings seem to favour the orientation effect as an explanation for the observed differences in the light curves of the bal qsos and non - bal qsos .",
    "the detection of microvariability in radio - quiet non - bal qsos , the detection of flat spectrum radio - loud bal qsos , together with the results presented here open the possiblilty that the bal qso systems are a direct link between the radio - loud bl lacs and the radio - quiet qso samples .",
    "krishan & wiita ( 1994 ) have considered detailed physics of a variety of plasma mechanisms that could give rise to variability in agns from time scales of hours to years . these fall broadly under mhd fluctuations , flares , and plasma - modulated electromagnetic wave instabilities .",
    "of these , the last class appears to be best suited to describe the short time scale variations seen here .",
    "more observations of a larger sample are required to be able to detect similarities / dissimilarities among the different class of objects and also ascertain the nature of the observed microvariabilities .",
    "we present the first results from a pilot programme to monitor the short term optical variability in bal qso systems .",
    "intra - night optical variations of @xmath24 were detected on time scales of @xmath1 one hour in qsos 0846 + 156 and 0856 + 172 .",
    "further , the mean magnitude level decreased in the two objects by @xmath2 and @xmath3 magnitude respectively during the period of our observations .",
    "the observed light curves are quite similar to those previously seen in the flat spectrum radio - loud sources , especially the bl lacertae objects .",
    "qso 0856 + 172 showed a sudden dip in the light curve by @xmath20  mag .",
    "we thank the vbt time allocation committee for allotment of time for this programme , and also thank the referee for useful comments .",
