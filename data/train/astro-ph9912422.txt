    "the study of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy holds the promise of answering many of our fundamental questions about the universe and the origin of the large - scale structure ( see e.g.  bennett , turner & white  @xcite ) .",
    "the advent of low - noise , broadband , millimeter - wave amplifiers ( popieszalski  @xcite ) has made interferometry a particularly attractive technique for detecting and imaging low contrast emission , such as anisotropy in the cmb .",
    "an interferometer directly measures the fourier transform of the intensity distribution on the sky . by inverting the interferometer output ,",
    "images of the sky are obtained which include angular scales determined by the size and spacing of the individual array elements .    in an earlier paper ( white et al .",
    "1998 , hereafter @xcite ) we outlined a formalism for interpreting cmb anisotropies as measured by interferometers . in this paper",
    "we extend this analysis to consider an efficient method of analyzing the data that would be obtained from a series of uncorrelated pointings of an interferometer .",
    "in particular we examine what the upcoming degree angular scale interferometer ( dasi , halverson et al .",
    "@xcite ) experiment may teach us about cosmology .",
    "dasi is an interferometer designed to measure anisotropies in the cmb over a large range of scales with high sensitivity .",
    "the array consists of 13 closely packed elements , each of 20 cm diameter , in a configuration which fills roughly half of the aperture area with a 3-fold symmetry .",
    "each element of the array is a wide - angle corrugated horn with a collimating lens .",
    "dasi uses cooled hemt amplifiers running between 26 - 36ghz with a noise temperature of @xmath3k .",
    "the signal is filtered into ten 1ghz channels .",
    "details of the layout of the dasi horns is given below .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in  [",
    "sec : formalism ] we adapt the formalism of @xcite to deal with real and imaginary parts of the visibilities independently , and show explicitly how the formalism automatically imposes the constraint that the sky temperature is real . with the issues defined , we describe the configuration of dasi in  [ sec : config ] . in  [ sec : osf ] , [ sec : image ] we analyze mock data appropriate to single fields from dasi , showing how to construct an optimal basis for likelihood analysis .",
    "we specifically address the question of optimal sampling on the sky , which was omitted from our previous work .",
    "this leads naturally to a discussion of wiener filtered ( bunn , hoffman & silk  @xcite ) map making and we reformulate the strategy for imaging the sky in this basis , pointing out the complementarity between nasas _ map _ satellite and dasi at 30ghz .",
    "we discuss estimates of the angular power spectrum which are easy to implement for uncorrelated pointing of dasi in ",
    "[ sec : lucy ] and show that the finite field of view does not hamper our ability to reconstruct the angular power spectrum .",
    "finally in ",
    "[ sec : radical ] we discuss multi - frequency observations and present our power spectrum results in the context of `` radical compression '' ( bond , jaffe & knox  @xcite ) .",
    "the reader is referred to our earlier paper ( @xcite ) for a detailed discussion of how to formulate the data - analysis problem with an interferometer , plus references to earlier work .",
    "we briefly review the major elements here .    under the assumption of a narrow frequency band and a distant source ,",
    "the datum measured by an interferometer is proportional to the fourier transform of the observed intensity on the sky , i.e.  the sky intensity multiplied by the instrument beam .",
    "we label the `` primary '' beam of the telescope by @xmath4 , with @xmath5 a 2d vector lying in the plane ) the sky can be approximated as flat with excellent accuracy .",
    "] of the sky .",
    "every pair of telescopes in the interferometer measures a visibility at a given point in the fourier plane , called the @xmath6 plane , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the temperature ( fluctuation ) on the sky and @xmath9 is the variable conjugate to @xmath5 , with dimensions of inverse angle measured in wavelengths .",
    "the ( omitted ) proportionality constant , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the planck function , converts from temperature to intensity .",
    "the spacing of the horns and the position of the beam on the sky determine which value of @xmath9 will be measured by a pair of antennae in any one integration .",
    "the size of the primary beam determines the amount of sky that is viewed , and hence the size of the `` map '' , while the maximum spacing determines the resolution .",
    "the 2-point function of the observed visibilities is the convolution of the sky power spectrum , @xmath12 , with the fourier transforms of the primary beams .",
    "if our theory is rotationally invariant the power spectrum is diagonal , @xmath13 and on small scales ( @xcite ) @xmath14 where the dimensionless @xmath15 are the usual multipole moments of the cmb anisotropy spectrum and @xmath16 is the multipole index .",
    "this approximation works at the few percent level for a standard cold dark matter model when @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "the fourier transform of the primary beam is the auto - correlation of the fourier transform of the point response , @xmath19 , of the receiver to an electric field , @xmath20 and @xmath21 due to the finite aperture @xmath22 has compact support . in order to obtain a simple estimate of our window function",
    "it is a reasonable first approximation to take @xmath22 equal to the auto - correlation of a pill - box of radius @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the diameter of the dish in units of the observing wavelength .",

    "we show @xmath29 in fig .",
    "[ fig : win]a .",
    "for now we shall treat a single frequency . obviously for a fixed physical dish",
    "the @xmath22 will be slightly different for different wavelengths .",
    "we return to this complication in  [ sec : radical ] .",
    "in @xcite we presented the formalism in terms of complex visibility data .",
    "however it is easier practically to implement the analysis in terms of the real and imaginary parts of the visibility .",
    "we write these as @xmath30 .",
    "the cosmological contribution to the real and imaginary components is uncorrelated @xmath31 .",
    "assemble @xmath32 and @xmath33 into a vector consisting of first the real and then the imaginary parts  the signal correlation matrix of this vector takes block - diagonal form .",

    "( we have dropped the normalization factor which converts temperature to flux . )",
    "note that if @xmath37 the visibilities are completely ( anti-)correlated , as would be expected given that @xmath38 is the fourier transform of a real field : @xmath39 .",
    "the factor of @xmath40 out front reflects the fact that the full variance @xmath41 is the sum of the real and imaginary components .    in the case where all correlated signal is celestial ,",
    "the correlation function of the noise in each visibility is diagonal with @xmath42 if the noise in the real and imaginary components is uncorrelated , then each makes up half of this variance . here",
    "@xmath43 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath44 is the system noise temperature , @xmath45 is the aperture efficiency , @xmath46 is the physical area of a dish ( not to be confused with @xmath4 ) , @xmath47 is the number of baselines receivers is @xmath48 . ]",
    "corresponding to a given separation of antennae , @xmath49 is the bandwidth and @xmath50 is the observing time .",

    "the configuration shown represents an optimal configuration , within the physical constraints , for the purposes of measuring cmb anisotropy .",
    "as described in the last section , the distance between each pair of horns represents a baseline at which a visibility can be measured .",
    "each visibility probes a range of angular scales centered at @xmath61 where @xmath0 is the baseline in units of the wavelength .",
    "the sensitivity as a function of @xmath62 is given by the window function ( see eq .",
    "[ eqn : wadef ] ) . since the width of the window function",
    "is determined by the size of the apertures , the optimal coverage for the purpose of cmb anisotropy is that configuration which spans the largest range of baselines with the most overlap between neigbouring window functions . in one dimension",
    "such optimal configurations are known as golomb rulers ( dewdney  @xcite ) , and a well known procedure exists for finding them .",
    "finding an optimal solution in two dimensions , within the physical constraints , can not be done analytically .",
    "we have optimized the configuration numerically .",
    "we have searched the 7 dimensional parameter space of horn positions ( an @xmath63 and @xmath64 position for each of 4 horns , minus one overall rotation ) for the configuration which minimized the maximum separation between baseline distances , while at the same time covering the largest range of angular scales .",
    "trial starting positions were determined by a simple monte carlo search of the parameter space . from each of these positions",
    "a multi - dimensional minimization was started .",
    "two additional constraints were imposed upon the allowed solutions : no two horns could come closer than 25 cm , the physical size of the horn plus surrounding `` lip '' , and all horns etc had to lie completely within the 1.6 m diameter base plate ( leading to a maximal radius of @xmath65 cm ) .",
    "our `` optimal '' solution is given in table  [ tab : config ] .",
    "the baselines run from 25 cm to 120 cm with the largest gap between baseline distances being 6.4 cm .",
    "a quick glance at fig .  [ fig : vis]b shows that the signal in most of the visibilities will be highly correlated , i.e.  the apertures have a large overlap .",
    "this is shown quantitatively in fig .",
    "[ fig : eigen]a where we plot one row of the signal correlation matrix . given a `` trial '' theory",
    "we can perform a change of basis to remove these correlations ( see  6.2 of @xcite , or tegmark et al .",

    "the input theory can be considered as a prior in the context of bayesian analysis , or could be iterated to match the data if so desired . for our purposes all that will matter",
    "is that the signal variance is independent of @xmath66 and decreases with @xmath60 . for concreteness we will take @xmath67constant , normalized to the cobe 4-year data ( bennett et al .",
    "@xcite ) . for this choice",
    "the cosmological signal is approximately equal to the noise in each of the highest @xmath60 bins in fig .",
    "[ fig : vis]b .",
    "let us consider only the real parts of the visibilities for now , the imaginary parts are dealt with in an analogous manner .",

    "note however that in 1 day of observation dasi measures nearly 200 high signal - to - noise eigenvectors !",
    "we have tested that reducing the number of orientations of the instrument , i.e.  the oversampling in @xmath78 , does not significantly reduce the number of high signal - to - noise eigenvectors until the apertures in the outermost circle are just touching , at which point there are 160 modes with @xmath79 .",

    "we shall return to this issue in  [ sec : radical ] .",
    "dasi provides coverage over a significant part of the @xmath6 plane , and as such is able in principle to perform high resolution imaging of the sky . the high signal to noise of the dasi instrument and the large dynamic range in angular scale",
    "however make imaging a computationally challenging task . in this section",
    "we present two approaches which we have tried with mixed success on simulated data .",
    "we discussed the wiener filtering formalism for producing an image from the visibility data in @xcite . here",
    "we note that in the @xmath75 basis it is straightforward to construct the wiener filtered sky map ( bunn , hoffman & silk  @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recall that for wiener filtering the sky temperature is approximated by @xmath82_{jk}^{-1}\\quad v_k\\ ] ] where @xmath83 is the real - space temperature correlation function , @xmath84\\ ] ] we choose @xmath85 for the real components and @xmath86 for the imaginary components , and @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the visibility signal and noise correlation matrices .",
    "we have written the expression in this mixed way to avoid needing to invert a matrix of size @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the number of pixels in the map being reconstructed , but conceptually the @xmath91 term can be replaced with @xmath92 .",
    "then in the @xmath75 basis one simply replaces @xmath75 with @xmath93 which down - weights modes with low signal - to - noise .",
    "specifically @xmath94 where @xmath95\\ ] ] where we choose @xmath85 for the real components and @xmath86 for the imaginary components .",
    "the ratio @xmath96 is plotted in fig .  [",
    "fig : eigen]b , where we can see that @xmath77 of the modes will contribute significantly to the final map .",
    "the expected variance in the final map is also easily computed : @xmath97 which approaches @xmath98 as @xmath99 .",
    "note that the wiener filter is _ not _ power preserving , so the maps should not be used for power spectrum estimation .    by reducing the total number of modes that need to be kept in the summation",
    "the @xmath75 basis can speed up calculation of the wiener filtered map .",
    "this is an advantage , but even with this speed up we found that producing a high resolution map of even a single field on the sky is very computationally expensive due to the large number of matrix multiplications involved in computing @xmath100 .",
    "an alternative to wiener filtering , which is very similar in the high signal - to - noise regime in which we are working , is the minimum variance estimator for @xmath101 .",
    "the number of operations required to produce the minimum variance and wiener filtered maps are comparable , and both tend to be very slow .",
    "we are currently investigating faster approximate methods of image making .",
    "the formalism above can in principle be used for making maps at each frequency , or one can make a map which combines the frequencies in such a way as to isolate the cmb ( or foreground ) signal . while the formalism looks more complex , it is in fact easy to implement computationally .",
    "the techniques are well known ( see  [ sec : radical ] ) : we imagine that at each point in the @xmath6 plane our visibilities form a vector @xmath102 whose components are the different frequencies .",
    "we can expand this vector in terms of the physical components we wish to consider , e.g. , @xmath103 in the absence of noise it is easy to solve for @xmath104 as @xmath105 if we write @xmath106 then we should replace @xmath22 by @xmath107 throughout .",
    "in the presence of noise we may define @xmath108 by a minimum variance estimator as above : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the channel noise matrix and capital roman letters indicate the component being considered ( see  [ sec : radical ] ) .",
    "we end our discussion of imaging with an observation about the complementarity between the _ map _ satellite and dasi . in making maps of the sky with dasi ,",
    "the largest source of error is the missing long wavelength modes which are filtered out by the dasi primary beam .",
    "the long wavelength power can be included in the map by simultaneously fitting another data set ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in this particular case the data from the _ map _ satellite at the same frequency is the obvious choice since _ map _ will have full sky coverage .",
    "we show the window functions for _ map _ at the relevant frequencies , along with the envelope for dasi in fig .",
    "[ fig : mapwindow ] .",
    "while the @xmath75 are the natural basis from the point of view of signal - to - noise and wiener filtering , and can dramatically improve likelihood function evaluation , they are not necessarily the quantities of greatest physical interest for power spectrum estimation . in @xcite",
    "we discussed estimating a series of bandpowers using the quadratic estimator of ( bond , jaffe & knox  @xcite , tegmark  @xcite ) . here",
    "we present a simpler approach more appropriate to unmosaiced fields . in this presentation",
    "we shall assume we are dealing with single frequencies ; the case of multiple frequencies is dealt with in  [ sec : radical ] .    in cmb anisotropy observations with single dish experiments",
    "much has been written about optimal ways to estimate the power spectrum .",
    "the principle reason is that care must be taken in weighting the data to ensure that no sharp cut - offs in real space are introduced .",
    "these lead to ringing in fourier space and delocalize the window function ( e.g.  discussion in tegmark  @xcite ) . for the interferometer no such problem arises  each visibility samples a compact region in @xmath9 . for each @xmath111 ,",
    "the square is a noise biased estimate of the power spectrum convolved with a window function .",
    "if we define @xmath112 with @xmath113 the noise variance in ( the component of the ) visibility @xmath114 , then @xmath115 is an unbiased estimator for @xmath116 : @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the window function in analogy to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : wadef ] ) . we have included the factor of 2 in the definition of @xmath115 to account for the fact that each component @xmath111 of the visibility contributes half of the total variance of @xmath119 .",
    "take a weighted average of the @xmath115 : @xmath120 .",
    "the simplest weighting is to sum all of the @xmath115 with @xmath121 and we shall use that below . under the assumption that the visibilities are gaussian , the error matrix for the estimates @xmath122",
    "is @xmath123 note that for @xmath124 uncorrelated visibilities ( real and imaginary parts ) contributing to @xmath122 this gives @xmath125 as expected .    for dasi in the configuration shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vis]b one can construct 26 different estimates @xmath122 , which will however be quite correlated .",
    "we show the @xmath126 correlation matrix for every _ second _ estimate in table  [ tab : corr ] along with the expected error on each determination ( the diagonal elements ) . as independent pointings",
    "are included in the analysis the error bar on each @xmath122 decreases as @xmath127 , but the correlations remain the same . without mosaicing ( @xcite ) the resolution in @xmath62 is restricted to @xmath128 , thus the individual determinations are required to be highly correlated .",
    "the error on the highest @xmath62 bins is still dominated by the small number of independent samples , in this case 16 .",
    "increasing the oversampling in the angular direction ( and the observing time ) can reduce this error to about 23% , hardly worth the extra time compared to including a different pointing .    the @xmath122 are estimates of the power spectrum",
    "_ convolved with the window function _ @xmath129 .",
    "given a theory it is straightforward to compare to the data once the window functions are known , and we discuss this in  [ sec : radical ] .",
    "however one could ask whether ( or how much ) cosmological information has been lost due to the convolution or if the information is still present in the correlated visibilities .",
    "one way of answering this question is to attempt to perform an approximate ( theory independent ) deconvolution .    the simplest ( `` direct '' ) method is to assume that @xmath130constant through the window , so that @xmath131 with @xmath132 .",
    "( alternatively one could assume that @xmath133constant , which leads to a similar expression . ) for the window function of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : tildea ] ) we have @xmath134 . as we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : deconvolve ] , this technique works surprisingly well for dasi , even though the fwhm of each window is @xmath135 , over which scales we can expect power spectra to change significantly . for a cdm power spectrum for example , the approximation above induces a systematic 10% error ( at worst ) due to the window function `` washing out '' the peak structure .    to avoid this problem , we can attempt to perform the deconvolution by an iterative procedure . recall that we are trying to constrain the power spectrum , while our measurements are the spectrum convolved with a positive semi - definite kernel  the window function .",
    "in this situation lucy s method ( lucy  @xcite ) can be used . we have implemented lucy s algorithm , following baugh & efstathiou  ( @xcite ) , including a coupling between different bins and a regularization of the iteration . as they found , the final result is not sensitive to the mechanism chosen .",
    "to briefly re - cap the method : we think about the deconvolution problem , following lucy  ( @xcite ) , first in terms of probability distributions . if we denote by @xmath136 the probability of measuring a quantity @xmath63 and @xmath137 the conditional probability of measuring @xmath64 given that @xmath63 is true then @xmath138 which is a convolution integral .",
    "we wish to estimate @xmath136 given observations @xmath139 .",

    "( [ eqn : probeqn ] ) , for @xmath136 , using the observed @xmath139 and rewriting @xmath143 leads us to the iterative expression for @xmath144 : @xmath145 where the denominator is unity .",
    "the iterative method we use takes this expression over with the replacements @xmath146 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 . approximating the integrals as sums equally spaced in @xmath0 we have the iterated pair of equations : @xmath149 to make the iteration converge more stably we in fact replace only a fraction @xmath150 of @xmath151 with @xmath152 on each step , and average the @xmath153 using a 2nd order savitsky - golay filter of length @xmath154 .",
    "the final result is insensitive to the details of this procedure , the number of bins chosen for @xmath155 etc .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : deconvolve ] results of a deconvolution assuming that 16 independent patches of sky were observed , each for 1 day .",
    "we can see that the deconvolution works well , with good resolution in @xmath62 and no bias over the scales where dasi has sensitivity .",
    "thus we expect that no important cosmological information has been lost by the convolution procedure .",
    "the points are highly correlated , but we do not show the correlations on the figure ( all correlations were included in the analysis ) .",
    "the error bars are so large because they are the computed from the variance _ allowing all other bins to vary freely_.    though the example here was for a single frequency channel , the generalization to multiple frequencies is straightforward and can in principle allow even finer sub - band resolution .",
    "finally we remark that obviously a statistical comparison of a given model to the data should be done with the @xmath122 .",
    "the correlations of the @xmath122 can be computed for any given theory ( e.g.  table  [ tab : corr ] ) .",
    "this allows a full likelihood analysis to be done , and is the route which should be taken when comparing dasi data to a specific theory .",
    "this is what we shall discuss now .",
    "to constrain theories using interferometer data is much easier than in the case of single dish data , thus many of the powerful techniques developed for the latter case are not needed .",
    "the primary reason for this is that interferometers work directly in the @xmath62-space of theories .",
    "it is straightforward to perform `` radical compression '' ( bond , jaffe & knox  @xcite ) of an interferometer data set and quote a set of bandpowers along with their full noise covariance matrix and window functions .",

    "we now reintroduce the multi - frequency nature of the data set that has been suppressed during most of this paper . for dasi we can work with 10@xmath1561ghz channels which we shall label with a greek subscript .",
    "following dodelson  ( @xcite ; see also white  @xcite ) we imagine that our visibility signal @xmath157 at each point in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane is a sum of contributions with different frequency dependences : @xmath158 .",

    "<S> we present an optimized layout of horn positions for the degree angular scale interferometer ( dasi ) , which provides good coverage of the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane and 3-fold symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate how an optimal subspace filtering analysis of a single pointing of dasi could be used to determine the anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background over a range of angular scales near @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the complementarity between the angular scales probed by dasi and nasa s _ map _ satellite at 30ghz and strategies for imaging the sky at these frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we quantitatively assess how well the angular power spectrum can be recovered by deconvolution of linear combinations of squares of the dasi visibilities . </S>"
