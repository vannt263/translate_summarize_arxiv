    "we start our experiments by preparing two @xmath17li atoms in the @xmath46 and @xmath47 hyperfine states  labeled @xmath0 and @xmath1  in the motional ground state of an optical microtrap . to do this",
    "we follow the procedure established in serwane et al.@xcite .",
    "we first prepare a two - component fermi gas consisting of @xmath48  atoms in a crossed - beam optical dipole trap at a temperature of @xmath49nk .",
    "this dipole trap acts as a reservoir from which we load about 1000 atoms into our microtrap , which is created by focusing a far red - detuned laser beam ( @xmath50 nm ) with a custom - designed high - resolution objective ( @xmath51)@xcite .",
    "we then apply a magnetic field gradient to deform the trapping potential until only a single bound state remains in the microtrap .",
    "this spilling technique allows us to prepare systems of one @xmath0 and one @xmath1 atom in the ground state of the trap with a typical fidelity above @xmath52 .    to characterize our microtrap ,",
    "we have measured its trapping frequencies using modulation spectroscopy .",
    "we find trap frequencies of @xmath53khz and @xmath54khz at an optical power of @xmath55w , which is in good agreement with our expectations for a cigar - shaped dipole trap with a waist of @xmath56 and an aspect ratio @xmath57 .",
    "to form a double - well potential , we create two microtraps which are partially overlapping .",
    "we achieve this by using an acousto - optical deflector ( aod ) to create two separated laser beams that are incident upon the objective under slightly different angles , which the objective translates into a spatial separation of the two foci in the focal plane . to control the spacing and the tilt of the resulting double - well potential we tune the relative angle and intensity of the two trapping beams .",
    "we do this by changing the frequencies and amplitudes of two rf - signals driving the aod . to obtain a tunnel coupling which is on the order of 100hz at our typical light powers of @xmath58w",
    ", we set the frequencies to values of 32mhz and 38mhz which corresponds to a spacing of the double well of @xmath59 m . to tune the strength of the tunnel coupling during our experiments , we change the overall depth of the potential which we control by actively stabilizing the overall light power @xmath60 of the trapping beams . at these trap parameters ,",
    "the individual wells have a depth of approximately @xmath61{khz}$ ] and the height of the potential barrier between them is approximately @xmath62{khz}$ ] . to compare our double well to optical lattice experiments",
    ", we can define an effective lattice wavelength @xmath63 and calculate the recoil energy @xmath64{khz}$ ] , where @xmath65 is the planck constant and @xmath66 is the mass of @xmath17li .",
    "since our experiment allows us to independently address the individual wells of our potential , we can perform site - selective atom - number detection by switching off one of the wells and measuring the number of atoms in the remaining well .    to do this",
    ", we first decouple the wells by rapidly increasing the height of the potential barrier within 2ms .",
    "this ramp is fast compared to the time scale of the tunnel coupling but slow enough to avoid heating of the atoms into higher trap levels .",
    "then we slowly turn off one of the wells while keeping the overall light power constant . during this process",
    ", the atoms in this well are adiabatically transferred into excited states of the remaining well .",
    "therefore , we use the spilling technique introduced above to remove all atoms from these highly excited states .    to count the number of atoms in the remaining well , we release the atoms from the microtrap , recapture them in a magneto - optical trap and measure their fluorescence with a ccd camera ( andor ixon dv887 ) for an exposure time of 1 second @xcite .",
    "to experimentally realize the hubbard model , our double - well system has to fulfill the tight - binding approximation and the single - band approximation .    in a lattice potential",
    ", the wavefunction of a single particle can be described as a superposition of localized wavefunctions centered on the individual sites of the lattice . in the limit of tight binding , the overlap between wavefunctions located on different sites is small and they can be approximated by the eigenstates of the individual wells . in this case , the tunnel coupling @xmath10 between adjacent sites is much smaller than the lowest excitation energy on the individual wells . since in our double well ,",
    "the tunneling constant @xmath10 is approximately @xmath67{hz}$ ] and the axial trap frequency @xmath68 in each well is about @xmath69{khz}$ ] , the tight - binding approximation is well fulfilled in our system .    in the single - band approximation",
    ", one only considers the motion of the particles in the lowest bloch band , which is composed of the ground states of the individual wells . to fulfill this approximation , all energy scales in the system have to be much smaller than the band gap to the first excited band . in our double - well system , we initialize both atoms in the ground state of one well ( see sec.[sec : prep ] ) and limit the interaction energy @xmath11 to values smaller than the lowest excitation energy of the single wells during all our experiments . for all but the largest values of the interaction energy we estimate the wavefunction overlap between two interacting particles localized in a single potential well and the respective non - interacting ground state to be above @xmath70{\\%}$ ] . for the largest interaction energies of @xmath71{hz}$ ] for the dataset with @xmath72{hz}$ ] ( @xmath73{hz}$ ] for @xmath74{hz}$ ] ) the overlap decreases to @xmath75{\\%}$ ] ( @xmath76{\\%}$ ] ) .    using these two approximations ,",
    "the spatial wavefunction of a single particle in our double - well system can be described as a superposition of the ground - state wavefunctions of a particle in the left @xmath77 or the right @xmath78 well .",
    "this results in a two - level system where the states @xmath77 and @xmath78 are coupled with a tunnel coupling @xmath10 .",
    "we calibrate the hubbard parameters of our double well by observing the tunneling dynamics in our system . to determine @xmath10 and @xmath27 , we study the tunneling of two non - interacting particles between the wells ( sect.[sec : tunneling ] and sect.[sec : tilt ] ) .",
    "we then determine the on - site interaction energy @xmath11 for different strengths of the interparticle interaction ( sect.[sec : onsite ] ) .          to prepare the initial state for our tunneling experiments , we start from two non - interacting atoms in the ground state of a single microtrap ( see sec.[sec : prep ] )",
    ". then we slowly ramp on a second trapping beam ( see sec.[sec : dwpotential ] ) and thereby change the shape of the potential from a single gaussian well to a double - well potential . during this ramp ,",
    "we linearly increase the overall power @xmath79 to keep the depth of the initial well constant . at any time in this process",
    ", @xmath79 is large enough to prevent the atoms from tunneling between the wells .    to start the tunneling dynamics , we lower the height of the barrier between the two wells within @xmath80ms . since this ramp",
    "is fast compared to the time scale of the tunnel coupling we can treat it as a sudden switch - on of the tunneling . yet , this ramp is slow enough to avoid exciting the atoms into higher bands .",
    "we then let the system evolve for different hold times , ramp up the barrier to decouple the wells and finally measure the number of atoms in one of the wells , using the detection scheme described above .",
    "as an example , the tunneling oscillation of two non - interacting atoms in a symmetric double - well at an overall power of @xmath81{\\mu w}$ ] is shown in fig.1 . to determine the value of the tunnel coupling @xmath10 we fit the observed oscillation with a damped sine wave and find @xmath82hz and a damping time of @xmath83ms .",
    "we believe that the main cause for the observed damping is dephasing due to long - term drifts of the tilt of the double - well potential .",
    "to calibrate @xmath10 for different barrier heights , we perform these measurements for different values of the overall light power @xmath79 ( fig.2a ) . for our experiments , we use light powers of @xmath84w and @xmath85w which result in tunnel couplings of @xmath86hz and @xmath87hz .",
    "tunneling between two states that are separated by a potential barrier is only possible if their energy difference @xmath27 is not much larger than their tunnel coupling @xmath10 . to achieve this for our double - well system",
    ", we control the relative depth of the two wells by changing the relative power of the rf signals driving the aod ( see sec.[sec : dwpotential ] ) .",
    "to calibrate the tilt @xmath27 , we measure the oscillation frequency for various values of the relative rf power ( fig.2b ) .",
    "we fit the measured frequencies with the effective coupling @xmath88 expected for a two - level system .",
    "we find good agreement to the data and therefore conclude that our non - interacting system can be described by the two - site hubbard model ( see sec.[sec : hubbard ] ) .",
    "using this fit , we calibrate the tilt @xmath27 in units of the tunnel coupling @xmath10 and extract the relative rf power where the double well is balanced ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "to observe coherent tunneling in our double - well system , we have to stabilize the relative depth of the two wells with a precision better than @xmath10 . for our typical trap depth of @xmath89{khz}$ ] and",
    "tunnel couplings of @xmath90{hz}$ ] ( at an overall light power of @xmath91{\\mu w}$ ] ) , this corresponds to a relative stability of the intensities of the two beams that is on the order of @xmath92 .",
    "however , switching on the second well leads to heating of the aod which results in a slow drift of @xmath27 on the order of @xmath93{hz}$ ] over several seconds .",
    "since these drifts are the same in every experimental cycle , we can compensate them by applying an exponential ramp to the relative rf power . using this technique ,",
    "our stability is currently limited by slow drifts of the tilt which are on the order of @xmath94{hz}$ ] to @xmath95{hz}$ ] per day .",
    "to control the on - site interaction energy @xmath11 between two particles that occupy the same well , we change the s - wave scattering length @xmath96 between the atoms with a magnetic feshbach resonance . to calibrate the interaction energy as a function of the magnetic offset field , we study the tunneling of two interacting particles .    for a system with two particles in one well",
    ", the energy is shifted with respect to the non - interacting system by the interaction energy @xmath11 . if the two particles tunnel together , this interaction energy is conserved and consequently pair tunneling is resonant in a symmetric double well at all interaction strengths . however",
    ", if a single particle tunnels to the other well the particles can no longer interact and hence single - particle tunneling is effectively detuned by the interaction energy @xmath11 .",
    "we can compensate this effective detuning by a tilt of @xmath97 between the two wells@xcite .",
    "this allows us to determine the on - site interaction energy by measuring the value of the tilt at which single - particle tunneling is restored .    to perform this calibration",
    ", we measure the amplitudes of single - particle and pair tunneling as a function of tilt .",
    "to do this we initialize the system with two interacting atoms in the left well , let them tunnel between the wells for different hold times and measure the number of atoms in the right well . from these measurements ,",
    "we extract the probabilities of finding 1 or 2 atoms in the right well , average over all hold times and plot them as a function of the tilt ( fig.2 of main text ) .",
    "we observe that the tilt at which single - particle tunneling is resonant shifts with the interaction strength whereas the pair - tunneling resonance remains at @xmath33 . by fitting lorentzians to the resonance peaks and measuring their separation , we can therefore determine the value of the on - site interaction @xmath11 for different magnetic fields ( fig.3a ) .         since the value of the on - site interaction energy depends on the depth of the confining potential",
    ", we perform the calibration of @xmath11 for the two potential depths ( see sec.[sec : onsite ] ) we use in our experiments . to check whether the measured interaction energies are affected by off - site interactions we compare our results to a calculation of the interaction energy of two particles in a cigar - shaped potential ( fig.3b)@xcite . within the errors we find good agreement with our data and",
    "therefore conclude that the effects of off - site interactions in our experiments are small .",
    "the good agreement between the measured and calculated interaction energies allows us to use the results from this calculation as the calibration for @xmath11 for all our measurements .",
    "to prepare two atoms in an eigenstate of the symmetric double well , we start with two non - interacting atoms in the ground state of a single well and adiabatically change the shape of the potential to a double well . to prepare the system in the ground state @xmath98 , we initialize the system in state @xmath99 , but keep the left well much deeper than the right one .",
    "then , we lower the potential barrier between the wells and thereby set the tunnel coupling @xmath10 to a value of about @xmath67{hz}$ ] . by setting a tilt of @xmath100",
    ", we make sure that tunneling is far off - resonant ( @xmath101 ) and the initial state @xmath99 has almost complete overlap with the ground state of the tilted double well ( fig.4 ) . by adiabatically reducing the tilt to @xmath102 within 100ms we then bring the system into the ground state of the symmetric double well .    using the same technique",
    ", we can also prepare the atoms in the highest energy state @xmath44 . to do this , we start again in state @xmath99 , but this time we set the right well to be much deeper than the left one ( @xmath103 ) . lowering the barrier",
    "then transforms the initial state @xmath99 into state @xmath44 ( fig.4 ) .    after preparing the non - interacting eigenstate of the double - well system",
    ", we adiabatically introduce interparticle interactions by ramping the magnetic field from the zero - crossing of the scattering length at 527 g to values between @xmath104{g}$ ] and @xmath105{g}$ ] over 60ms .",
    "this corresponds to scattering lengths between @xmath106{a_0}$ ] and @xmath107{a_0}$ ] and interaction energies between @xmath108hz and @xmath109hz , where @xmath110 is the bohr radius ( fig.3 ) .",
    "similar to the experimental sequence presented here , one can also start from an interacting system with large tilt and both particles in the deeper well and then adiabatically go to the ground state of the symmetric double well @xcite .    to confirm the adiabaticity of the ramps in tilt and in interaction strength",
    ", we drive the system from state @xmath99 to the final configuration , hold the system for different durations and then reverse both ramps . to check for excitations ,",
    "we measure the mean atom number in the ground state both with and without the ramps . within the statistical uncertainty of our measurement",
    "we could not detect any heating caused by the ramps . from these measurements ,",
    "we determine a fidelity of @xmath111% of preparing the system in the ground state of the symmetric double well .",
    "to observe the transition from the metallic to the insulating regime , we measure the probability of single and double occupancy in the symmetric double well as a function of interaction strength ( fig.3 of main text ) .",
    "hence , we first prepare the system either in state @xmath98 or state @xmath44 at different interaction strengths ( see sec.[sec : pass_eigenstates ] ) . then",
    ", we quickly ramp up the potential barrier to decouple the wells and measure the atom number in either the left or the right well .",
    "we repeat this measurement 300 times for each well and count how often we detect zero atoms ( @xmath112 ) , one atom @xmath113 ) , or two atoms ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "the probabilities of measuring @xmath115 , @xmath116 , or @xmath80 atoms follow as : @xmath117 , where @xmath118 and @xmath119 is the total number of measurements in both wells .    in our measurement",
    ", we have finite fidelities both for the preparation of the initial state and the detection of the final atom number .",
    "both the preparation fidelity and the detection fidelity reduce the measured atom numbers as compared to an ideal measurement . in a symmetric",
    "double well the influence of these processes on the measured probabilities can not be distinguished .",
    "we therefore combine the preparation and detection fidelity into an overall fidelity @xmath120 which we define as the mean atom number per well .",
    "we determine @xmath120 by averaging over all individual measurements .    due to the finite fidelity @xmath121 of our experiment , the measured probabilities @xmath122 , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 deviate from the probabilities @xmath110 , @xmath125 , and @xmath126 of an ideal experiment with @xmath127 : @xmath128 these three equations can be inverted to calculate the ideal probabilities : @xmath129 using these corrected probabilities , we define single occupancy as the probability of measuring a single atom ( @xmath130 ) and double occupancy as the sum of the probabilities of measuring either zero or two atoms ( @xmath131 ) . for comparison , the results for single occupancy and double occupancy in the ground state @xmath98 using both the corrected and the non - corrected probabilities are shown in fig.5 . to verify that our measurement of the occupation statistics is insensitive to small drifts of the tilt",
    ", we performed the measurement for state @xmath44 at different tilts in a range of @xmath132{hz}$ ] around @xmath33 .",
    "we observe that while the tilt affects the probabilities @xmath110 and @xmath126 of finding zero or two particles in the individual wells there is no significant change in the double occupancy @xmath133 .",
    "to directly observe the effect of the tunnel coupling on the energy of our double - well system , we measure the energy difference @xmath134 between state @xmath44 and state @xmath45 by trap modulation spectroscopy . we start by initializing state @xmath44 with a tunnel coupling of @xmath135{hz}$ ] and interaction energies between @xmath136 and @xmath137 , as described above .",
    "then we perform a sinusoidal modulation of the total trapping power with frequencies between @xmath138{hz}$ ] and @xmath139{hz}$ ] for a duration of @xmath140{ms}$ ] .",
    "the atoms are transferred resonantly to state @xmath45 if the modulation frequency matches the energy difference @xmath25 . to minimize the distortion of the energy spectrum",
    ", we modulate the tunnel coupling only with a small amplitude of @xmath141 . to determine whether the atoms have been transferred to state @xmath45",
    ", we adiabatically turn off the interactions , ramp to a large tilt @xmath142 and measure the number of atoms in the right well .",
    "if the system has remained in state @xmath44 during the modulation , both atoms are then in the left well . however ,",
    "if the system has been transferred to state @xmath45 , there is a large probability to observe a single atom in the right well for @xmath142 ( fig.4 ) .",
    "we plot the mean atom number in the right well as a function of the modulation frequency and extract the resonance frequency with a gaussian fit ( fig.6a ) .",
    "to measure the effects of second - order tunneling , we have to control the tilt better than @xmath143 , which is approximately @xmath89{hz}$ ] at @xmath144 .",
    "this is comparable to the residual drifts in our calibration of the tilt @xmath27 over the course of several days ( see sec.[sec : tilt ] ) .",
    "we solve this problem by measuring the resonance frequency for different tilts around @xmath102 for each of the interaction energies .",
    "we determine the shift @xmath145 between our set value @xmath146 and the tilt @xmath27 in the experiment for each data set by fitting a rabi function @xmath147 with @xmath148 and @xmath10 as free parameters .",
    "we then center our data by subtracting the respective @xmath148 .    for a non - interacting system ,",
    "the energy difference @xmath25 is given by the transition frequency @xmath149 .",
    "for an interacting system , we can still use this fit to center our data , but it does not yield the correct value for @xmath25 .",
    "hence , we compare our measurements to a numeric solution of the hubbard model with fixed parameters @xmath11 and @xmath10 as calibrated from the tunneling measurements ( dashed curves in fig.6b ) .",
    "we observe resonance frequencies which are systematically higher than predicted .",
    "therefore , we fit the data with a numeric hubbard model with @xmath150 as a free parameter ( solid lines ) . we obtain @xmath151 for the balanced double - well system at different values of @xmath11 from the fitted curves ( fig.6c and fig.4 of the main text ) .",
    "one possible cause for the deviation of the fixed - parameter hubbard model from our data is that the modulation of the trapping potential results in a modified tunnel coupling .",
    "therefore , we scale @xmath25 and @xmath11 with the modified tunnel coupling @xmath152{hz}$ ] which we obtain from the fit at @xmath23 ."

    "<S> 1 ) fully describes the oscillations of two interacting particles in our double well ( solid line in fig.1d ) .    to use our system as a fundamental building block of the hubbard model , we must be able to prepare the particles in the ground state of the symmetric double well . to achieve this , </S>",
    "<S> we first initialize the system with both atoms in the left well and a tilt @xmath34 . then </S>",
    "<S> , we adiabatically change the tilt to bring the system into the ground state of the symmetric double well @xcite ( sec . </S>",

    "<S> we therefore determine the probabilities @xmath35 of finding the two particles on different sites ( single occupancy ) and @xmath36 of finding both particles on the same site ( double occupancy ) by measuring the probabilities of having 0 , 1 or 2 atoms in one of the wells ( sec . vii of @xcite ) .    in a noninteracting system ( @xmath23 ) </S>",
    "<S> , the spatial wave function of two particles in the ground state is an equal superposition of the basis states @xmath18 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to equal probabilities @xmath40 and @xmath41 which we observe in our measurements ( fig.3a ) .    in a system with strong repulsive on - site interactions , it is energetically unfavorable to have two atoms occupying the same site . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state of our system then becomes a two - particle analog to a mott - insulating state which we observe as a reduction of double occupancy . </S>",
    "<S> for attractive interactions we observe an increase in double occupancy that marks the onset of a paired state . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret this state as the two - particle limit of the cold gas analog of a charge - density - wave state as described in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we perform these measurements for two different barrier heights . for the larger barrier height ( @xmath42{hz}$ ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , we find good agreement with the prediction of the hubbard model ( fig.3a ) . </S>",
    "<S> for the smaller barrier height ( @xmath43{hz}$ ] ) , we observe a small deviation from the theoretical expectations which might indicate that our system is approaching the limits of the hubbard approximation .    </S>",
    "<S> since in our isolated , two - particle system excited states are stable against relaxation , we can also prepare the system in the highest - energy eigenstate @xmath44 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> s4 of @xcite ) . when measuring the occupation statistics of this state as a function of interaction strength , we find that the number of doubly occupied sites is enhanced for repulsive interactions ( fig.3b ) . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to study the charge - density wave regime in a system with repulsive interactions .    in our final measurement </S>",
    "<S> , we directly probe the effect of the tunnel coupling on the energy of the system by trap modulation spectroscopy ( sec . viii of @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> for this , we initialize the system in state @xmath44 and measure the energy difference to state @xmath45 as a function of interaction strength . for @xmath23 </S>",
    "<S> , the atoms are delocalized over the wells by single - particle tunneling . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a change in the kinetic energy of the system that is proportional to the tunnel coupling @xmath10 ( fig.4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> as we increase the interactions , the system enters the insulating regime and first - order tunneling is suppressed . however , second - order tunneling is still possible and we observe a crossover to a new energy scale given by the superexchange energy @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> this energy is directly responsible for the appearance of spin order in the ground state of the hubbard model .    by combining a series of isolated double wells we can realize a dimerized lattice @xcite where each dimer contains two fermions in a spin - singlet configuration with high fidelity . by adiabatically lowering the barriers between the double wells </S>",
    "<S> , we can then prepare a low - entropy state in a homogeneous lattice . </S>",
    "<S> since our systems can be prepared with arbitrary filling factors they are also ideally suited to study the effects of hole doping . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the tunability of our potential allows us to explore finite - size lattices with arbitrary geometries @xcite and introduce controlled disorder into our system . </S>",
    "<S> finally , our experiments provide a starting point for scalable quantum computation with neutral atoms @xcite . </S>",
