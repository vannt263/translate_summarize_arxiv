    "the present data on neutrino oscillations shows that pattern of neutrino masses and mixing ( pontecorvo - maki - nakagava - sakata mixing matrix ) is not an analogue of that for quarks ( cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa quark mixing matrix ) @xcite .",

    "this might happen , if the lepton number violating neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath0-decay ) will be undoubtable observed in running @xcite or planned @xcite @xmath0-decay experiments .",
    "the @xmath0-decay is a very sensitive probe for the majorana neutrino mass @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-decay can occur through different processes but all of them require that the neutrino has nonzero mass and is a majorana particle @xcite .",
    "the most proximate or discussed theoretical model is to mediate the @xmath0-decay by the exchange of a light majorana neutrinos . a measurement of the decay rate , when combined with neutrino oscillation data and a reliable calculation of nuclear matrix elements ( nmes ) , would yield insight into all three neutrino mass eigenstates , the type of neutrino mass spectrum ( normal hierarchy or inverted hierarchy ) and possibly majorana cp - violating phases .",
    "an important subject in neutrino physics is a reliable calculation of the @xmath0-decay nme @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , there are no observables that could be directly related to magnitudes of nmes . the most popular nuclear structure methods , which has been applied for this task , are proton - neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) with its variants @xcite and the large - scale shell model ( lssm ) @xcite .",
    "recently , there has been significant progress towards the reduction of uncertainty in the calculated nmes @xcite .",

    "any more complex structure of correlation function , e.g. , a consideration of different correlation functions for different channels , would result in violation of requirements in ( [ condzero ] ) as the talmi - moshinski transformation is considered .    recently , it was proposed @xcite to adopt instead of the jastrow method the ucom approach for description of the two - body correlated wave function @xcite .",

    "a method of choice is , e.g. , the brueckner - bethe hole - line expansion , the coupled cluster method ( ccm ) or exponential s approach and the approach of self - consistent evaluation of green functions @xcite .",
    "there are various modern nn potentials , which yield a very accurate fit to the nucleon - nucleon scattering phase shifts .",

    "they differ in description of both long - range and short - range parts of nn - interaction .",
    "the cd - bonn is derived in the framework of the relativistic meson field theory .",
    "the argonne potential is a purely local potential in the sense that it uses the local form of the one - pion exchange potential for the long - range part and parametrizes the contributions of medium and short - range distances in terms of local functions multiplied by a set of spin - isospin operators .",

    "their accuracy is of the order of 25% .",
    "a significant amount of the uncertainty is due to a quenching of the axial - vector coupling constant @xmath33 in nuclear medium @xcite . for a comparison we present also the nmes calculated with the phenomenological jastrow src function in table [ tab : t12 ] .",
    "the notable differences between the results calculated with jastrow and ccm src are about of 20 - 30% . of course , the results obtained with the ccm src are preferable .",
    "unfortunately , they can not be directly compared to those of the complementary large - scale shell model ( lssm ) as they have been evaluated only with the jastrow and ucom src and for @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the lssm values ( see table [ tab : t12 ] ) would be increased also by the order of 20 - 30% , if the ccm src would be considered .",
    "recall , that within both approaches qualitatively the same @xmath91 dependence of @xmath9 was found @xcite .",
    "[ fig : total ] shows our calculated ranges for @xmath158 , which are compared with ranges calculated with miller - spencer jastrow function and the latest lssm results .",
    "given the interest in the subject , we show the range of predicted half - lives corresponding to our full range of @xmath9 in table [ tab : t12 ] .     with the ccm and miller - spencer jastrow treatments of the short range correlations . for comparison the results of a recent large scale shell model evaluation of @xmath155 that used the jastrow - type treatment of short range correlations",
    "are also shown . ]",
    "recently , the occupation numbers of neutron and proton valence orbits in the @xmath1 and @xmath159 nuclei were measured by neutron and proton adding and removing transfer reactions @xcite . in following theoretical study @xcite",
    "these results were used as a guideline for modification of the effective mean field energies that results in better description of these quantities .",
    "the calculation of the @xmath0-decay nme for @xmath1 performed with adjusted mean field @xcite and in combination with the selfconsistent rqrpa ( srqrpa ) method @xcite , which conserves the mean particle number in correlated ground state , lead to a reduction of @xmath9 by 25% when compared to previous qrpa value .",
    "the phenomelogical jastrow and ucom src were considered .",
    "we found that a reduction of 20% in the case of ccm cd - bonn src .",
    "we have @xmath160 here , the first and second values in each line correspond to the qrpa with woods - saxon mean field and the srqrpa with adjusted woods - saxon mean field @xcite way of calculations , respectively . in order to better understand the role of proton and neutron occupation numbers in the @xmath0-decay calculation further experimental and theoretical studies are needed what goes beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we have addressed the issue of a consistent treatment of the short - range correlations in the context of the @xmath0-decay .",
    "these correlations , which have origin in the short - range repulsion of the realistic nn interaction , are neglected in the mean - field , the lssm and the qrpa descriptions .",
    "till now , miller - spencer jastrow and the ucom src have been introduced into the involved two - body transition matrix elements , changing two neutrons into two protons , to achieve healing of the correlated wave functions .",
    "the effect of these src was considered as an uncertainty @xcite .    in this article",
    "the ccm short - range correlations has been considered .",
    "they were obtained as a solution of the coupled cluster method with realistic cd - bonn and argonne v18 interactions .",
    "an analysis of the squared correlation functions , represented by a ratio of correlated and uncorrelated neutrino potentials , has showed a principal differences among the miller - spencer , ucom and ccm src .",
    "in addition , the importance of the effect of the fns was studied .",
    "it was found that both ccm src and the fns effect reduces the @xmath0-decay nmes by a comparable amount for a considered choice of form - factor masses . the suppression due to miller - spencer src is about twice larger when compared to results without src and the fns effect .",
    "finally , we have improved the presently available calculations by performing a consistent calculation of the @xmath0-decay nmes in which pairing , ground - state correlations and the short - range correlations originate from the same realistic nn interaction , namely from the cd - bonn and argonne potentials .    discussions with petr vogel are gratefully acknowledged .",
