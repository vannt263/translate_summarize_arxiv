    "when two or more oscillatory processes are coupled , there exists the possibility of their becoming synchronized . where their autonomous frequencies are different but close , synchronization is understood as the adjustment of those frequencies as a result of coupling .",
    "even when such systems operate on different timescales , synchronization may still appear as an adjustment of their frequencies to an integer ratio , an effect known as _ high - order synchronization _ or synchronization of order @xmath1:@xmath4 .",
    "synchronization of order @xmath1:@xmath4 has been extensively studied , both experimentally and theoretically ( cf .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "for instance , simonet and co - workers @xcite investigated a ruby nuclear magnetic resonance laser with delayed feedback .",
    "the undriven laser exhibited periodic oscillations of light intensity at a frequency @xmath5 @xmath6 40 hz . an external periodic voltage , either sinusoidal or square - wave , was then added in the feedback loop . in both cases , synchronizations of different order @xmath1:@xmath4",
    "were observed .",
    "another example is the electrical rotator consisting of a josephson junction , shunted by a capacitor , and fed with a constant external current .",
    "experiments show that this system can be synchronized when a periodic driving current is applied , or where two junctions are coupled @xcite .",
    "there are many additional examples .",
    "synchronization has also been observed extensively in biology .",
    "one example is the cardiorespiratory system , considered in the pioneering works by kenner et al , hildebrandt and raschke @xcite .",
    "schfer and co - workers @xcite proposed the synchrogram as a tool to visualize cardiorespiratory synchronization .",
    "when plotting the instantaneous respiratory phase at the occurrence of a heartbeat versus time , they found horizontally striped plots for some subjects , thereby revealing @xmath1:@xmath2 synchronization between heart and respiration .",
    "toledo et al @xcite showed that the probability of such synchronization happening by chance was extremely small . in measurements on anaesthetised rats ,",
    "stefanovska et al @xcite observed lengthy synchronization epochs , and transitions from one ratio to another .",
    "they suggested that such transitions might be useful in monitoring depth of anaesthesia .",
    "there are several nonlinear models yielding @xmath1:@xmath4 synchronization .",
    "arnold proposed @xcite a map of the circle into itself , obtaining synchronization `` tongues '' and calculating their widths in the approximation of small coupling .",
    "in fact , any orientation - preserving homeomorphism @xmath7:@xmath8 of the circle into itself presents such regions of @xmath1:@xmath4 locking @xcite .",
    "integrate - and - fire models provide several examples of arnold tongues @xcite .",
    "high - order synchronization regions were also obtained by glass and sun @xcite for an impulse - driven poincar oscillator .",
    "schilder and peckham @xcite treated arnold tongues numerically , and they obtained tongues for the system of two coupled van der pol oscillators ; here the tongues are quite narrow , so that the probability of locking in a real , noisy system , would therefore be very small .",
    "simonet and co - workers proposed a model @xcite that reproduced the synchronizations observed in the laser .",
    "for cardiorespiratory synchronization , kotani et al @xcite developed a model , based on those of deboer et al @xcite and seidel and herzel @xcite , which is supported on both physiological and mathematical principles .",
    "the model involves a somewhat complicated system consisting of several oscillators and interactions , and includes some non - analytic parts ( integrate - and - fire ) . because of technical difficulties encountered when tackling nonlinear models , the deep mechanisms through which synchronization takes place are not yet understood in general , so that there is still no way of predicting which equations , and which values of their parameters , will or will not yield synchronization .",
    "the present paper has two main purposes .",
    "first we present a systematic study of high - order synchronization in a particularly simple system , a rotator under harmonic forcing , for which we can establish the roles played by each of its parameters in synchronization .",
    "although we study a specific system , and although the deep mechanisms responsible for synchronization are not unveiled in this paper , we report below two results that we believe will be useful in the quest for those deep mechanisms : we show that the main arnold tongues are wider when @xmath3 depends more strongly on @xmath0 ; and that competition occurs between synchronization regions .",
    "our second purpose is to discuss and explore two possible mechanisms giving rise to an extensively observed phenomenon : transitions between the different @xmath1:@xmath4 synchronization ratios .",
    "the mechanisms considered here arise from time variability .",
    "we will also discuss briefly why time variability hinders the analysis of synchronization in experimental data .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : system ] we introduce the simple rotator whose synchronization properties are to be considered . sec .",
    "[ sec : synctongues ] discusses how its regions of @xmath1:1 and @xmath1:@xmath4 synchronization are identified and reports the main results obtained under stationary conditions , including the observation of competition between the tongues .",
    "time variability and its effect on transitions between different synchronization states is discussed in sec.[sec : transitions ] .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] summarizes the main conclusions .",
    "the generic equation for the angle @xmath0 of a rotator without external interaction is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a @xmath11-periodic function @xcite .",
    "therefore , such a system can be studied systematically by considering functions @xmath10 up to a certain number @xmath12 of harmonics , and allowing a bigger number @xmath13 of harmonics at the next stage of the study . in this paper , we start the study for a function consisting of the zero harmonic ( the `` constant force '' , thanks to which a rotator has the features of a self - sustained oscillator ) and the first harmonic . by means of a translation in the value of @xmath0",
    ", it can always be written as @xmath14 with @xmath15 and @xmath16 constants , where ( [ ourrotator ] ) is an adler - type equation @xcite .",
    "we assume @xmath17 so that , in the absence of interaction ( nothing is added to ( [ ourrotator ] ) ) , the angle @xmath0 continuously increases . for @xmath15",
    "much bigger than @xmath16 , @xmath0 increases at an almost constant rate . for @xmath16 close to @xmath15",
    ", however , @xmath3 varies strongly with @xmath0 .",
    "we show that ( [ ourrotator ] ) can synchronize to an external forcing , exhibiting a wide variety of arnold tongues , and we discuss the processes that may be responsible for transitions between different @xmath1:@xmath4 synchronization ratios .",
    "the equations for the overdamped pendulum , and the overdamped josephson junction , are of just this type .",
    "the equation of motion of a pendulum driven by a constant torque @xmath18 is described by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the frequency of small oscillations , @xmath21 is the damping constant , and @xmath22 is the moment of inertia .    in a resistively shunted josephson junction ,",
    "the current is a sum of three contributions : a superconducting current @xmath23 , a current @xmath24 through the resistance , and a capacitance current @xmath25 .",
    "the parameter @xmath26 is called the critical supercurrent of the junction .",
    "the relationship between the potential @xmath27 and the `` angle '' @xmath28 is given by the josephson formula @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the electronic charge .",
    "summation of the three terms yields the equation for a junction fed with an external current @xmath22 @xmath31 equations ( [ pendulum ] ) and ( [ josephsonjunction ] ) coincide . in the overdamped limit , when the term with the second derivative can be neglected  in the case of the josephson junction",
    ", this means that there is no capacitor in the circuit ",
    "these equations reduce to the one that we study in this paper ( [ ourrotator ] ) .",
    "thus the results that we obtain below will be applicable to the overdamped pendulum and the overdamped josephson junction .    as ( [ ourrotator ] )",
    "is analytically integrable , we find that the frequency for the non - interacting rotator is @xmath32 we now consider the effect of an external harmonic force on the rotator @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "this equation applies to a number of situations in nature . in the case of a josephson junction , eq.([rotatorforced ] ) describes when the system is fed with a continuous intensity plus a harmonic one . in relation to cardiorespiratory synchronization , ( [ rotatorforced ] ) can be regarded as a very simple model in which the rotator ( [ ourrotator ] ) models the heart , and the addition of the harmonic component models its interaction with respiration @xcite .",
    "( [ rotatorforced ] ) has been studied @xcite for large amplitudes @xmath35 of the harmonic component .",
    "however , we are interested here in the arnold tongues down to very small driving amplitude , in order that we can also apply the results to the weakly coupled rotator .",
    "( [ rotatorforced ] ) defines a circle map with the following prescription : let us call @xmath36 the time at which the external driving is at its @xmath37 maximum .",
    "we define @xmath38 . as ( [ rotatorforced ] )",
    "is a first - order differential equation and we have an initial condition @xmath39 , we could integrate to obtain @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath41 be the time at which the external driving is at its @xmath42 maximum , and let @xmath43 .",
    "that is how we have the map @xmath7:@xmath8 defined as @xmath44 .",
    "we would therefore expect the existence of arnold tongues @xcite .",
    "now we introduce the concept of @xmath1:@xmath4 synchronization that will be used in this work .",
    "suppose we have a rotator driven by a @xmath45-periodic external action @xmath46 then , any @xmath47-periodic motion of @xmath0 , @xmath48 , must have a period that is a multiple of the driving period .",
    "let @xmath49 be such that @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath51 be the number of times that the angle crosses @xmath52 mod @xmath11 with @xmath53 in one of its periods @xmath50 .",
    "we then say that the rotator is @xmath1:@xmath4 synchronized to the external driving @xmath54 .",
    "the synchrogram consists then of _ horizonal lines _ , albeit not necessarily equally spaced .",
    "note that any periodic motion of the forced rotator automatically implies @xmath1:@xmath4 locking to the external action for some @xmath1 and @xmath4 .      putting the above definition of @xmath1:@xmath4 synchronization into mathematical terms , we say that the rotator gets synchronised @xmath1:@xmath4 to the external force if there exists a stable root ( zero ) for the function @xmath55 where @xmath56 stands for the return map @xmath7 composed with itself @xmath4 times . in general ,",
    "if @xmath57 has two or more roots , there is at least a stable fixed point .",
    "regardless of the initial condition , the trajectory is attracted towards a stable fixed point .",
    "the function @xmath57 depends , of course , on the parameters of ( [ rotatorforced ] ) , so it changes as we vary the external driving frequency @xmath58 . at the moment of transition from two zeros to no zero",
    ", there is only one root , on which @xmath57 is tangent to the horizontal axis , this single zero is a half - stable fixed point . at this moment , a _ saddle - node bifurcation _ takes place .",
    "obtaining the borders of the arnold tongues therefore involves retrieving the two driving frequencies at which the saddle - node bifurcation takes place for different values of the driving amplitude @xmath35 . for this purpose",
    "a _ continuation software _ was written in c. the first step was to obtain the poincar return map @xmath7 , so the interval @xmath59 $ ] was divided into many points . at each of these , the function @xmath56 was obtained by integration of the differential equation ( [ rotatorforced ] ) with the fourth - order runge - kutta method , thereby obtaining @xmath60 . for given values of @xmath35 and @xmath58 , we know that we are inside the tongue if @xmath57 has two or more roots , and outside if @xmath57 has no zeros . hence , for a given value of @xmath35 , we can trace the left and right values of @xmath58 at which the saddle - node bifurcation takes place , up to the desired precision .",

    "then , for sequentially increasing values of @xmath35 , we first guess approximately the bifurcation points on the left and right boundaries by linear extrapolation from the two former bifurcation frequencies in each case .",

    "a point of interest here is that there are several arnold tongues that are wide enough to be seen , not only by seeking them in a tuned experiment , but also through passive observations in the presence of noise , e.g.  the cardiovascular system @xcite .    in our second parameter",

    "there are even some on this fig .  with @xmath76 , the highest value of @xmath4 that we trailed .",
    "as we reduce the lower cutoff of the width criterion , many new tongues arise in the plot .",
    "the effect of synchronization with the external action can be inferred from the fact that these tongues are not vertical lines , but curved .",

    "[ fig : tonguesdetailed](a ) and [ fig : tonguesdetailed](b ) shows that the tongues become closer to vertical straight lines for smaller @xmath16 , implying that synchronization is more and more a matter of fine tuning of the external driving frequency rather than of the interaction of the rotator with the external action .",
    "this phenomenon provides further confirmation of our hypothesis that a strong dependence of instantaneous frequency on angle ( for the uncoupled rotator ) helps high - order synchronization .",
    "the curving of the high - order tongues in fig.[fig : tonguesdetailed](a ) can be attributed to the occurrence of _ competition among tongues _ :",
    "in this case the 4:1 tongue widens as the coupling increases and `` pushes '' the high - order tongues .",
    "our circle map @xmath7 is always invertible , because equation ( [ rotatorforced ] ) can be integrated with reversed time .",
    "therefore , lemma 1.5 in @xcite says that the arnold tongues can not overlap .",
    "that is the basis on which we argue that there must be competition among the tongues .",
    "@xmath77{tongues22.eps}\\\\ \\includegraphics[width=0.48\\textwidth]{tongues23.eps } \\end{array}\\ ] ]    we note here several signs of such competition",
    ". first , the 37:9 tongue appears in fig .",
    "[ fig : tonguesdetailed](b ) but not in [ fig : tonguesdetailed](a ) , because it is narrower there .",
    "we can interpret this effect as 33:8 and 41:10 _ squeezing _ it for the set of parameters used in [ fig : tonguesdetailed](a ) .",
    "in the same way , the widths for 33:8 and 41:10 obtained via the synchronization index in fig .",
    "[ fig : tonguesdetailed](a ) are of the order of @xmath78 at @xmath79 , and of the order of @xmath80 at @xmath81 .",
    "nevertheless , the width of the synchronization region as @xmath79 must tend exactly to zero .",
    "as indicated above , the computation of arnold tongues via a synchronization index ( using ( [ synchindex ] ) in our case ) is less accurate .",
    "because of this evident contradiction between the obtained width of the tongue as @xmath79 ( width bigger than zero ) and the actual value of the width ( strictly zero ) , we need a more defined approach . the first try was to obtain the bifurcation points with the first programme but it was impossible : although we set a high precission , we failed to find any zeros for the function @xmath57 .",
    "that is why we are introducing the third method of obtaining approximately arnold tongues for tricky cases like this one : _ trailing the bifurcations in their `` flexible '' meaning_. instead of considering that we are inside the tongue when @xmath57 has a stable zero , we relax the condition and just ask @xmath57 to have an `` almost ( half stable ) zero '' , defined as a point where @xmath57 takes an absolute value smaller than a threhold ( set here to be 0.001 ) .",
    "it means that , if we measure the angle of the rotator at the times when the external action has a maximum , this angle will stay for a long time around this minimum ( or rather , minimum in absolute value ) .",
    "what happens afterwards depends on the behaviour of @xmath57 .",
    "if @xmath57 increases quickly ( in absolute value ) when we separate from the minimum , the angle will slip and come back promptly to the minimum ( modulus @xmath11 ) .",
    "if @xmath57 is still very small when we separate from the minimum , the angle will have a slow drift when iterating @xmath57 so , in practice , the system will be regarded as synchronized , unless the measurements are very precise .",
    "the tongue 33:8 obtained this way is plotted in fig.[fig:2superdetailed](a ) , together with the 4:1 tongue obtained before . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2superdetailed](b ) we plotted the width of the 33:8 tongue as a function of the driving amplitude @xmath35 . because of the `` flexible '' way of obtaining the tongue , its width tends to a value bigger than zero as @xmath79 .",
    "the explanation is simple : without any driving ( @xmath61 ) there is no interaction , so the only possibility of having an apparent synchronization  not true synchronization , as there is no interaction  is to tune the external frequency to the value @xmath82 .",
    "this frequency is the only point of the arnold tongue in the limit @xmath79 .",
    "the function @xmath57 is there constantly equal to zero .",
    "if we make the external frequency slightly different from @xmath82 , with @xmath61 , the values returned by the function @xmath57 will still be very small , so many of them will be bellow the threshold ; that is the reason why the obtained width of the tongue in the limit @xmath79 is bigger than zero .",
    "of course , this `` flexible '' method is not completely accurate , and it gives the apparent contradiction above .",
    "nevertheless , we are using this method only to obtain qualitative conclusions , by _ comparing _ results all obtained with the same method .",
    "so we believe that the conclusions remain valid .    as we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig:2superdetailed](b ) , the width of the 33:8 tongue is more or less constant for @xmath35 near zero , and then it starts dropping at around @xmath69 .",
    "looking at fig.[fig:2superdetailed](a ) , we may interpret @xmath69 as the point where the 4:1 tongue has approached 33:8 enough to start squeezing it .",
    "the width of 33:8 reaches a minimum at @xmath83 and then it increases . in fig .",
    "[ fig:2superdetailed](a ) , @xmath83 is more or less the point where 4:1 switches from being concave ( concave from outside ) to convex , so it is consistent with the fact that the width of 33:8 starts increasing at this point : let us say that , before this point , 4:1 was `` invading '' 33:8 ; from this point , 33:8 `` starts recovering from 4:1 s invasion '' , so 33:8 gains space ( width ) and 4:1 switches from being concave to be convex ( of course , there are , mathematically speaking , an infinite number of tongues between 33:8 and 4:1 , but 4:1 is the most dominant in the area so it is the main influence ) .",

    "we therefore added to our system an extra low - frequency harmonic component , simulating eq .",
    "( [ rotatorforced ] ) with @xmath93=(9.85714 , 7.14286 ) , @xmath35=4 , @xmath94=0.213 , with a term @xmath95 added to the rhs , @xmath96=0.1 and @xmath97=0.001 .",
    "this value of @xmath98 may appear low compared to some natural systems , but the results we will obtain remain valid for larger @xmath98 provided it is small compared with the frequencies of the other processes . without adding the low frequency component , we would be inside the 5:1 tongue and the synchrogram would consist of 5 perfect horizontal lines . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : low1](a ) , the corresponding simulation exhibits transitions between 5:1 and 4:1 .",
    "note that we have added a harmonic low - frequency component ; with low - frequency noise , the sequence of transitions will not be predictable in the manner seen here . in fig .",
    "[ fig : low1](b ) we see a 9:2 epoch inside the transition region between the two longest epochs .",
    "this second mechanism is mathematically equivalent to a slow variation of the intrinsic frequency of the rotator .",
    "this can be seen by considering the low - frequency component to be absorbed inside @xmath15 , yielding an @xmath15 , and therefore a @xmath5 , that slowly vary with time . in nature , however , the picture is completely different , as the low - frequency noise comes from _ outside _ the rotator .",
    "although we can still recognise synchronization epochs from the synchrograms by sight , time variability  the origin of the two transition mechanisms discussed above  means that synchrograms no longer consist of perfect horizontal lines .",
    "the test via a synchronization index , often used when tackling real experimental data , must fail , even inside a small time window , unless we take a less strict threshold for the index .",
    "our result is in agreement with that obtained in @xcite by analysis of experimental data . in short",
    ", time variability interferes with synchronization ; at least for our system and with the index ( [ synchindex ] ) as a quantification of synchronization .",
    "a more detailed and quantitative study of the influence of time variability is in progress and will be reported elsewhere .",
    "we have shown that the driven rotator eq.([rotatorforced ] ) yields a vast variety of arnold tongues .",
    "our results are applicable to the several systems described by this equation , including the overdamped pendulum and the overdamped josephson junction . because the synchronization regions can be relatively wide , and",
    "because ( [ ourrotator ] ) is written in terms of continuous variables , the equation may be useful in modelling the wide range of high - order synchronization phenomena observed in nature , such as in the cardiorespiratory interaction .",
    "although we investigate a specific system , and although the deep mechanisms for synchronization are not revealed by our studies in this paper , two of the results that we have obtained are very interesting and likely to be useful in the quest for those deep mechanisms : we showed that a strong dependence of the instantaneous frequency on the angle helps high - order synchronization ; and we also identified and studied the phenomenon of competition among tongues .",
    "finally , we have discussed and explored two mechanisms of transition between different synchronization states .",
