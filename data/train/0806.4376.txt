    "this material is abstracted from previous work by the author ; see @xcite for a more detailed discussion and references to earlier work .",
    "it is hoped that by using the template analysis given below , it will be easier to recognize non - standard events .",
    "we define a standard supernova event ( sn ) and show how to scale to nonstandard cases .",
    "our standard sn is assumed to have    * a luminosity of @xmath0 , * an effective temperature of @xmath1 , and * will stay bright for a time of a few weeks ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "this implies several interesting things :    * using @xmath3 , the radius is @xmath4 .",
    "this is about 20 times larger than the radii of the largest supergiants . * to move this distance in @xmath5 implies an _ average _ velocity @xmath6 .",
    "the photospheric sound speed is only @xmath7 , so the flow is highly supersonic . *",
    "the energy radiated as visible light is @xmath8 .",
    "suppose for example , this is fully supplied by radioactive decay of @xmath9 . at about @xmath10 of plasma heating per decay",
    ", this implies more than @xmath11 of that nucleus be freshly produced in the sn plasma , which is itself much shorter than the half - life of 5.9 days .",
    "further , the time from synthesis to maximum light allows significant @xmath9 decay ( see @xcite ) . ] .",
    "the time scale for radiative diffusion of energy from a sphere of radius @xmath12 is @xmath13 , where the mean - free - path is @xmath14 , with @xmath15 the mass density and @xmath16 the rosseland mean opacity .",
    "we set this equal to the expansion time scale , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the velocity of expansion , and of order the average velocity we derived aboved .",
    "the average density is @xmath19 , so we obtain a time scale @xmath20 ^{1 \\over 2 } ,   \\label{tdiff}\\ ] ] which is essentially the time to maximum light for an expanding , diffusing sphere ( see   13.3 in @xcite ) .",
    "if the opacity @xmath16 is near the thompson scattering value ( 0.4 for pure h and 0.2 for pure @xmath21 ) , that factor is of order unity .",
    "taking @xmath22 and @xmath23 , we get @xmath24 or so .",
    "these expressions are approximate ; see @xcite or recent simulations for more precise values .",
    "nevertheless we see that the mass of the exploding object is star - sized , yet less than the most massive stars ( probably due to mass loss ) .    using this mass and radius , the average density is @xmath25 , so that for @xmath26 the mean - free - path is @xmath27 .",
    "the object is therefore 240 mean - free - paths deep .",
    "this justifies using the diffusion time , but also indicates that supernovae are a transition between optically - thick stars and optically - thin nebulae .",
    "taking this mass and the average velocity , the kinetic energy is @xmath28 , or one bethe , so that the radiated photon energy is only about 0.02 of this .",
    "adiabatic cooling converts internal energy into kinetic energy , so that for this radiation - dominated gas , this corresponds to an initial radius smaller by the same factor , 0.02 , which gives @xmath29 .",
    "this is in the range of radii of red giants .",
    "shock heating can power the light curve only if the progenitor has a radius this large ; otherwise the shock energy is degraded into kinetic energy of expansion . to the extent that the light curve is dominated by shock energy ,",
    "a large radius means a bright , slow event , and a small radius means a dim , fast event .",
    "mass loss by single massive stars and by binary interactions is an important parameter for interpreting supernovae behavior @xcite . as eq .",
    "[ tdiff ] indicates , a larger mass gives a slower light curve by increasing the diffusion time .",
    "unless there is matter to collide with at radii @xmath30 , the kinetic energy of expansion is unable to provide radiation .",
    "how much mass loss would be required to provide enough circumstellar matter to affect the light curve ?",
    "we consider one interesting case : suppose that the progenitor is a red supergiant losing mass with a velocity @xmath31 . the uniform mass loss rate for the progenitor would be @xmath32",
    ". the sn shock would collide with this pre - existing mass distribution , raising the energy of this material at a rate @xmath33 , where the rate of sweeping up of mass is @xmath34 .",
    "substituting @xmath35 we have from the progenitor mass loss , @xmath36 , or @xmath37 a mass loss rate of @xmath38 from the progenitor in a time @xmath39 prior to the explosion implies a significant source of energy .",
    "does it make a visible display ? where does this energy go ?",
    "the collision occurs in optically - thin plasma , under non - equilibrium conditions ; we are in a `` nebular '' regime .",
    "the collision generates turbulence , and that generates magnetic field .",
    "being optically thin , significant radio and x - ray emission occurs .",
    "cosmic - ray acceleration should result ( @xcite ) .",
    "see @xcite for a detailed analysis of the well - observed sn1993j .",
    "radioactive decay energy can not be adiabatically cooled until the decay actually happens , so radioactive energy is automatically `` saved '' until a time corresponding to the mean lifetime of the decay .",
    "each radioactive species adds an exponential decay component to the light curve .",
    "for this to be significant , a large amount of mass must be synthesized into a suitable nucleus .",
    "@xmath9 is exceptional in this regard : it is doubly - magic , and the most bound nucleus having equal numbers of neutron and protons @xmath40 , so it is easy to synthesize by explosions from fuels with @xmath40 .",
    "the ashes of all hydrostatic burning stages up to oxygen consumption have @xmath40 to a suffienctly good approximation to allow profuse production of @xmath9 .",
    "it is the dominant radioactivity found so far .",
    "@xmath9 decays to @xmath41 by electron - capture with a 5.9 day halflife .",
    "the co decays by both electron - capture and by positron - emission to @xmath42 with a 77.3 day halflife .",
    "the characteristic light curves of type  i supernovae reflect this double decay , with their `` decline from peak '' and `` tail . ''",
    "more massive ejecta have longer radiative diffusion times , and can smear out the @xmath9 peak , leaving only the @xmath41 tail .",
    "the stable product , @xmath42 , is the sixth most abundant nucleus in the solar - system abundance distribution , and almost all is believed to be formed in supernova explosions .",
    "there are a number of other important radioactive nuclei , such as @xmath43 and @xmath44 , which act as tracers of nucleosynthesis but none have yet been found which dominate the light curve so much as the @xmath9-@xmath41-@xmath42 chain .",
    "because of its profound affect on light curves , it is interesting to ask if it is possible for such explosions to produce little @xmath9 .",
    "do all of these explosions have radioactive heating ?",
    "there are at least two obvious cases in which the @xmath9 production is limited :    density gradient : : :    if the progenitor has a very steep density gradient around the core ,    there will be be little appropriate fuel .",
    "the mass of    @xmath46 matter , at right radius to be shocked hot enough    to make @xmath9 , will be too small for much    production .",
    "this happens for stars with cores very close to the    chandrasekhar mass ( e.g. , @xmath47 ) .",
    "accretion : : :    @xmath9 is made but collides with a massive mantle ,    is slowed , and accreted onto a newly formed neutron star or black    hole .",
    "this happens for fairly massive cores ( e.g. , stars    @xmath48 on the main sequence , having helium    cores of @xmath47 ) .",
    "some possible sources of internal energy to supply supernova light curves :    shock breakout : :    the emergence of the supernova shock from the progenitor star . roughly    speaking ,",
    "this occurs when the photon diffusion time equals the time    for the shock to reach the stellar surface .",
    "diffusion of shock energy : :    the leakage of shock - generated heat by radiative diffusion , after the    shock has gone beyond the stellar surface ( snii , e.g. ) .",
    "diffusion of heat from radioactivity : :    the heating by radioactive decay counters adiabatic cooling , and    powers the light curve ( sniabc , sn1987a , e.g. ) heating by new neutron star : :    mhd driven by rotational energy ( crab nebula pulsar ) , or late    accretion ( not recognized ? ) heating by accretion onto new black hole : :    ( not recognized ? ) heating related to binary companion : :    ( not recognized ? )    notice that several of these possibilities have not been recognized , and hence might be interesting to look for .",
    "with the rapid advance of astronomical technology , it is interesting to ask if there are types of events that we have not yet seen , but might . in this regard",
    "we note that what are now called supernova of type  ib and ic , were suggested to exist before they were recognized ; they were the `` bare cores '' discussed in @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that their observational data on 11 type  i supernovae fell into two classifications , ia and ib .",
    "the brighter ia s correspond to exploding white dwarf stars , for which analytic solutions for the light curves were available @xcite .",
    "the dimmer ib s correspond to core collapse events which produce @xmath9 , which @xcite first introduced to explain all types of supernovae .",
    "@xcite had suggested that both types should be found , and that the core collapse events would be dimmer because they would tend to make less @xmath9 .",
    "@xcite found a further class , ic s , which unlike ib s , are he poor ; apparently they are bare cores that lost he as well as h. @xcite give a review of the observational situation at the time .      .sn parameters and light curves [ cols= \" <",
    ", > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     table  [ tab : a ] sketches the sorts of exploding supernovae we might expect to find ; other entries may need to be added .",
    "the parameters varied here , besides initial mass , are initial radius @xmath49 , mass ejected by explosion @xmath50 , and presence of radioactivity .",
    "even this limited set covers much of the observed data set , at least in a crude way . but is the limited set of paramaters sufficient for a more complete and accurate data set ?",
    "some key points :    * it is not theoretically demanded that all `` supernova '' explosions have radioactive ejecta and/or large initial radii , the two features that make them bright .",
    "therefore , explosions of small initial radii and little radioacitity in their ejecta would be under - represented in the present data set .",
    "such events would be dim and fast . *",
    "none of these entries are related to binary interactions except is a fairly passive way of slow mass transfer for snia s .",
    "are there merger supernovae ( for example two white dwarfs or a white dwarf and a neutron star or black hole ) ? * mass loss , either by winds from single stars or by binary interactions , is an importent parameter for the observed explosion ; mass loss is not well understood from a predictive basis yet . *",
    "rotation and magnetic fields provide vector fields which interact and which we are just beginning to learn to simulate plausibly ; they are expected to be important aspects of the understanding of the formation of relativistic jets and grb s , as well as the general issue of angular momentum transport in stars .",
    "* fully 3d simulations of oxygen and silicon burning are in their infancy ( @xcite ) , and already there are indications of complexity we have not anticipated .",
    "for example ,",
    "2d simulations of c , ne , o , and si shells indicate that there are interactions between burning shells which are mediated by waves ( p- , g- , and mixed - modes ) , and none of this has yet been put into evolutionary models . *",
    "extrapolation to earlier cosmological epochs is made more uncertain by a lack of fundamental understanding of how magnetic fields , rotation , binary formation , and mass loss change with metalicity , yet interpretation of some of the new supernova observations may be affected by these issues .    despite these theoretical challenges ,",
    "the prospect for observation of previously inaccessible phenomena is excellent . for supernova studies ,",
    "the exploration of a broad time domain and greater completeness is exciting .",
    "it would be both a surprise and a disappointment if some really new phenomena , either unrecognized or unexpected , do not appear soon !    this work was supported in part by nsf grant 0708871 and nasa grant nnx08ah19 g at the university of arizona .",
