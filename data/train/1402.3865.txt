    "a spinor bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) consists of atoms with a spin degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "in addition to exhibiting spatial coherence , a spinor condensate also displays a range of spin orders , determined by the interactions and externally applied magnetic field .",
    "various aspects of the phase diagram and condensate dynamics have been explored in experiments , particularly for the case of spin-1 where the atoms can access three magnetic sublevels ( e.g.  see @xcite ) .",
    "an important feature of this system is that it exhibits a rich excitation spectrum with phonon and magnon branches @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we develop a formalism to describe the fluctuations of the various densities of interest for a spin-1 condensate .",
    "our primary focus is the total number density and the components of the spin density , motivated by the capability to measure these quantities directly in experiments ( e.g.  by stern - gerlach @xcite and dispersive @xcite probing ) .",
    "we characterise these fluctuations by calculating the relevant static structure factors .",
    "the bogoliubov description of the spin-1 condensate is expected to provide a good description of the system for temperatures well below the condensation temperature . within this framework , we present both numerical results and analytic expressions for the limiting behavior of the static structure factors . for each of the four distinct magnetic phases of the spin-1 condensate ,",
    "we relate how the three bogoliubov excitation branches contribute to the fluctuations .",
    "of particular interest are the antiferromagnetic and broken - axisymmetric phases , in which a second continuous symmetry associated with the spin degree of freedom is broken [ in addition to the @xmath0 gauge symmetry ] . this is revealed by the emergence of a second nambu - goldstone mode @xcite .    for the case of the total density , the long wavelength limit of the structure factor is @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the temperature , @xmath3 is the atomic mass and @xmath4 is the speed of sound ( also see @xcite ) .",

    "we also analyse the structure factors for the three components of spin density .",
    "analogous to the relation between fluctuations and compressibility for the density static structure factor , the long wavelength limit of the spin density structure factors reveals the magnetic susceptibility of the condensate .",
    "while the dynamic and static structure factors are well characterised for the case of scalar condensates ( e.g.  see @xcite ) , much less work has been done on multicomponent systems , although we note theoretical studies of binary condensates @xcite and an approximate treatment of the finite temperature transverse spin - density correlations in a quasi - two - dimensional ferromagnetic condensate ( see appendix b of ref .",
    "experimentally the static structure factor can be determined directly from fluctuation measurements ( e.g.  see @xcite ) , off - resonant light scattering @xcite and bragg spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "notably , in recent experiments spin - dependent bragg spectroscopy has been used to measure the @xmath10-spin density of a spin-@xmath11 fermi gas @xcite , and speckle imaging has been employed to measure the compressibility and magnetic susceptibility of a strongly interacting fermi gas @xcite . along this path",

    "[ fig : bafluctamps](c ) reveals that both the gapped magnon mode and the phonon mode contribute to these fluctuations .",

    "we conclude by briefly commenting on the qualitative behavior for @xmath202 . in this case",
    "the condensate magnetization tilts out of the @xmath180-plane and the nambu - goldstone branches ( i.e.  @xmath104 and @xmath105 branches ) become coupled ( c.f .  at @xmath195 , where the only coupling is between the @xmath104 and @xmath106 branches , giving rise to the avoided crossing ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite this occurrence was referred to as phonon - magnon coupling . as a result of this coupling",
    "the @xmath105 mode contributes to density fluctuations , and the @xmath104 mode contributes to @xmath47 fluctuations .",
    "in this paper we have developed a formalism for the static structure factor of a uniform spin-1 condensate subject to constant linear and quadratic zeeman shifts .",
    "our results are based on the bogoliubov formalism and are accurate to the leading order term proportional to the condensate density .",
    "the static structure factors are an important tool in quantifying fluctuations for scalar and binary systems ( e.g.  see @xcite ) , and this work is important for extending such results to the spinor system .",
    "a feature of spinor condensates is that additional continuous symmetries can be broken , leading to new nambu - goldstone modes , as is predicted to occur for the af and ba phases . for the af phase we found that the asymmetry in the nematic order of the condensate was revealed through the @xmath217 and @xmath218 fluctuations . in the ba phase we observed a divergence in the @xmath218 fluctuations associated with the spontaneous development of a transverse ( axial - symmetry - breaking ) magnetization .",
    "our results show that this divergence arises from the nambu - goldstone magnon mode .",
    "interestingly , such a divergence in fluctuations was not observed in our results for the af phase , which also has a nambu - goldstone magnon branch .",
    "the reason is that for the af phase the broken symmetry manifests only in the nematic order of the condensate , not in the spin order .",
    "indeed , an immediate extension of our theory is to assess fluctuations of the nematic density , @xmath221 as a generalisation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nematic_cond ] ) .",
    "we find that for the af state the fluctuations in @xmath222 diverge for @xmath82 due to both nambu - goldstone modes , with the magnon branch dominating .",
    "because some of the techniques used to image the spin density are also sensitive to the nematic density ( e.g.  see @xcite ) , the measurement of such fluctuations may also be possible in experiments .",
    "our analysis here has been for a uniform system , and several factors will become important in applying these results to the experimental regime .",
    "first , external trapping potentials cause the total density of the condensate to vary spatially and a full treatment of the trapped system would require a large - scale numerical solution of the gross - pitaevskii equation for the condensate and of the bogoliubov - de gennes equations for the quasiparticles .",
    "however , our analysis can be applied to this situation using the local density approximation , i.e.  we consider the gas to be homogeneous at each point in space using the local value of the condensate density .",
    "a discussion of the local density approximation in relation to the density response of a scalar condensate is presented in ref .",
    "second , in our analysis of the af and ba phases we have assumed that the axisymmetry is broken uniformly over the entire system .",
    "for the case where the system forms domains of local broken axisymmetry our analysis will only apply to each domain ( also see discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "we thank y.  kawaguchi for providing feedback on the manuscript . we acknowledge support by the marsden fund of new zealand ( contract uoo1220 ) .",
    "the large @xmath59 limits of the structure factors can be found directly from eq .  .",
    "for the small @xmath59 limits , we diagonalise a @xmath58 matrix to give the quasiparticle amplitudes for each phase . for the f and p phases ,",
    "the quasiparticle amplitudes are given in sec .",
