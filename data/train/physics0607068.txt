    "about forty years ago , veselago firstly introduced the concept of left - handed material ( lhm ) in which both the permittivity @xmath0 and the permeability @xmath1 are negative  @xcite .",
    "he predicted that lhm would have unique and potentially interesting properties , such as the negative refraction index , the reversed doppler shift and the backward cerenkov radiation .",
    "veselago pointed out that electromagnetic waves incident on a planar interface between a regular material and a lhm will undergo negative refraction .",
    "hence a lhm planar slab can act as a lens and focus waves from a point source .",
    "lhm did not receive much attention as it only existed in a conceptual form .",
    "after the first experimental observation of negative refraction using a metamaterial composed of split ring resonators ( srrs )  @xcite , the study of such materials has received increasing attention over the last few years . while negative refraction is most easily visualized in an isotropic metamaterial  @xcite , negative refraction can also be realized in photonic crystals  @xcite and anisotropic metamaterials  @xcite have also been reported .",
    "recently , pendry extended veslago s analysis and further predicted that a lhm slab can amplify evanescent waves and thus behaves like a perfect lens  @xcite .",
    "he proposed that the amplitudes of evanescent waves from a near - field object could be restored at its image .",
    "therefore , the spatial resolution of the superlens can overcome the diffraction limit of conventional imaging systems and reach the subwavelength scale .",
    "the great research interests were initiated by the revolutionary concept .",
    "more recently , the anisotropic metamaterials have been proved to be good candidates for slab lens application  @xcite .",
    "although the focusing is imperfect , the substantial field intensity enhancement can readily be observed . in these cases ,",
    "the anisotropic metamaterials under consideration are characterized by a hyperboloid dispersion relation , and the focusing is restricted to either e- or h - polarized radiation .",
    "the recent development in quasiisotropic metamaterial ( qimm ) offers us further opportunities to extend the previous work and further predict that both e- and h - polarized waves can be refocused .    the main purpose of the present work is to construct a polarization insensitive lens by a qimm slab . for",
    "shallow incident angles the qimm slab will provide some degree of refocusing in the same manner as an isotropic lhm slab .",
    "we are particularly interested in exploiting polarization insensitive effect .",
    "first , starting from the representation of plane - wave angular spectrum , we derive the propagation of paraxial beams in the qimm slab .",
    "our formalism permits us to introduce ideas for beam focusing and phase compensation of paraxial beams by using the qimm slab .",
    "next we want to introduce the inverse gouy phase shift and negative rayleigh length when waves propagating in the qimm slab . as an example",
    ", we obtain the analytical description for a gaussian beam propagating through a qimm slab .",
    "we find that the phase difference caused by the gouy phase shift in vacuum can be compensated by that caused by the inverse gouy phase shift in the qimm slab .",
    "if certain matching conditions are satisfied , the intensity and phase distributions at object plane can be completely reconstructed at the image plane .",
    "finally , we will discuss what happen when the evanescent wave transmission through the qimm slab .",
    "following the standard procedure , we consider a monochromatic electromagnetic field @xmath7 $ ] and @xmath8 $ ] of angular frequency @xmath6 incident from vacuum into the anisotropic metamaterial .",
    "the field can be described by maxwell s equations  @xcite @xmath9 the previous maxwell s equations can be combined in a straightforward way to obtain the well - known equation for the complex amplitude of the electric field , which reads @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the speed of light in vacuum .",

    ", the accompanying dispersion relation has the familiar form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the @xmath14 component of the incident wave vector .",
    "we note that the maxwell s equations are symmetrical in electric and magnetic fields .",
    "so as far as maxwell s equations is concerned , what we can do for electricity we can also do for magnetism . to achieve the polarization insensitive effect",
    ", we will focus our interesting on the anisotropic metamaterial , in which the permittivity and permeability tensor elements satisfy the condition : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a constant .",
    "a careful calculation of the maxwell s equations gives the dispersion relation :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 represents the @xmath14 component of transmitted wave - vector .",
    "the above equation can be represented by a three - dimensional surface in wave - vector space .",
    "this surface is known as the normal surface and consists of two shells  @xcite . under the condition of eq .",
    "( [ qc ] ) , we can find e- and h - polarized waves exhibit the same wave - vector surface .",
    "thus the anisotropic medium also be regard as qimm  @xcite .",
    "clearly , we can find the dispersion surface has the following two types : ellipsoid and double - sheeted hyperboloid , as show in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "we are currently investigating the possibilities for the manufacture of the qimm .",
    "in fact , it is now conceivable that a metamaterial can be constructed whose permittivity and permeability values may be designed to vary independently and arbitrarily throughout a metamaterial , taking positive or negative values as desired .",
    "hence the permittivity and permeability tensor elements of qimm can be controlled by modulating the length scale of the srrs .",
    "the permittivity @xmath19 and permeability @xmath20 can be approximated by the lorentz model .",
    "we trust that the qimm can be constructed , because similar technology has been exploited in anisotropic metamaterial  @xcite .",
    "in addition , photonic crystals might be a good candidate for constructing a qimm .",
    "the periodicity in photonic crystals is on the order of the wavelength , so that the distinction between refraction and diffraction is blurred .",
    "nevertheless , many novel dispersion relationships can be realized in photonic crystals , including ranges where the frequency disperses negatively with wave vector as required for a negative refraction  @xcite .",
    "now we want to enquire : whether e- and h - polarized exhibit the same propagation characteristic . to answer the question we first discuss the transmission of wave vector .",
    "we choose the @xmath21 axis to be normal to the interface , the @xmath22 and @xmath23 axes locate at in the plane of the interface .",
    "the @xmath21-component of the transmitted wave vector can be found by the solution of eq .",

    "the wave vector undergoes a positive refraction , while the energy flow undergoes a negative refraction.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    by now , we know that e- and",
    "h- polarized waves propagate with same wave vector and poynting vector .",
    "it is a significantly different property from general anisotropic media .",
    "note that there is a bending angle between @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and therefore @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 do not form a strictly right - handed or left - handed system in qimm .",
    "hence it is also different from isotropic media .",
    "for this reason , this kind of special anisotropic media is regarded as quasiisotropic .",
    "it should be mentioned that if @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ qc ] ) , e- and h - polarized waves will exhibit the same single - sheeted dispersion relation .",
    "while the two polarized waves will undergo different amphoteric refraction , the special anisotropic media can not be regarded as quasiisotropic  @xcite .",
    "now we are in the position to study the negative refraction in the qimm . unlike in isotropic media ,",
    "the poynting vector in the qimm is neither parallel nor antiparallel to the wave vector , but rather makes either an acute or an obtuse angle with respect to the wave vector . in general , to distinguish the positive and negative refraction in qimm , we must calculate the direction of the poynting vector with respect to the wave vector .",
    "positive refraction means @xmath46 , and negative refraction means @xmath47 . from eqs .",
    "( [ se ] ) and ( [ sh ] ) we get @xmath48 the negative refraction phenomenon is one of the most interesting properties of the qimm .",
    "we can see that the refracted waves will be determined by @xmath49 for e - polarized incident waves and @xmath50 for h - polarized incident waves .    because of the importance of negative refraction in refocusing effect , we are interested in the two types of qimm , which can formed from appropriate combinations of material parameter tensor elements .",

    "@xmath56 and @xmath47 .",
    "it yields that the refraction of poynting vector refraction is always negative even if the wave - vector refraction is positive .",
    "as noted above , the poynting vector will exhibit negative refraction in the two types of qimm .",
    "the negative refraction is the important effect responsible for the slab lens .",
    "hence , the two kind of qimm can be employed to construct a polarized insensitive lens .",
    "in this section , we consider the slab lens constructed by the qimm . as depicted in fig .",

    "it is instructive to compare these results with snell s law , which for refraction from vacuum into an isotropic medium , gives @xmath68 , where @xmath69 represents the refractive index of the refracting medium .",
    "evidently , in the present case we can find the relationship between @xmath64 and @xmath70 is nonlinear , which is caused by the anisotropic effect @xmath71 or @xmath72 .",
    "the nonlinear relationship will result in a significant aberration effect in the image plane , hence the achievable resolution of image is limited .",

    "it should be mentioned that , for the qimm slab with double - sheeted hyperboloid wave - vector surface , both e- and h - polarized beams can also exhibit the same intensity and phase reconstructed effect . because of the positive phase velocity embedded in this type of qimm , the paraxial beam will experience the positive rayleigh distance and gouy phase shift .",

    "in this section , we discuss under what conditions anomalous transmission will occur when an evanescent wave transmitted through the qimm slab .",

    "we can get that the overall transmission through both surfaces of the qimm slab is given by @xmath166 from eq .",

    "note that the conditions mentioned above are sightly different from those as hu and chui have obtained  @xcite .    as for h - polarized evanescent waves ,",
    "the overall transmission through both interfaces of the qimm slab can be obtained by similar procedures , and we can get the overall transmission coefficient : @xmath170 from eq .",
    "( [ th ] ) , we can see that in general cases , the amplitude of the transmitted h - polarized evanescent waves will also decay exponentially as the thickness of the qimm slab increases .",
    "but if the following conditions are satisfied , the overall transmission coefficient @xmath38 will be equal to @xmath171 , and the amplitude of the transmitted h - polarized evanescent wave will be amplified exponentially by the transmission process through the qimm slab .",
    "so for h - polarized evanescent waves , @xmath172 @xmath173 if conditions ( [ ehci ] ) and ( [ ehcii ] ) are satisfied , the qimm slab will enhance exponentially the transmitted waves . comparing ( [ eeci ] ) and ( [ eecii ] ) with ( [ ehci ] ) and ( [ ehcii ] ) , we find that in the presence of qimm , the conditions for e - polarized means automatically the conditions for h - polarized are satisfied .",
    "hence the qimm also exhibit the significant insensitive effect for evanescent waves .",
    "we stress that , for the qimm slab with double - sheeted hyperboloid dispersion relation , the evanescent waves can not be amplified .    in the above analysis",
    "the permittivity and permeability tensor elements are assumed to be lossless .",
    "however the effect of absorption , necessarily present in such materials , may drastically suppress any evanescent amplifying wave into a decaying one  @xcite .",

    "[ fig8](a ) with fig .  [ fig8](b ) suggests that large @xmath174 is not favored for the amplification of the evanescent wave inside the qimm slab .",
    "it is also clearly seen from figs .  [ fig8](a ) and [ fig8](b ) that a low reflection occurs at the interfaces , since the qimm slab is supposed to be well satisfied the conditions ( [ eeci ] ) and ( [ eecii ] ) .",
    "so far we have shown the simulation results of the evanescent wave interacting with qimm slabs with different absorptions and thicknesses .",
    "we find that the suppression of evanescent - wave amplification can be effectively relaxed by reducing the thickness of the qimm slab .",
    "the numerical examples provide direct evidence that an evanescent wave could be amplified in a qimm slab with finite absorption .",
    "unfortunately , the loss of a realistic metamaterial could not be reduced to a very small level  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the thickness of the qimm slab should be much smaller than the wavelength in order to realize the subwavelength imaging for such a system",
    ".    as a result of the amplification of evanescent waves inside the lossy qimm slab , superlensing effect with subwavelength image resolution could be achieved practically . while the main effect of anisotropy associated with qimm will limit the resolution of the image .",
    "although the image is imperfect , we trust that the reconstruct effect of intensity and phase in paraxial regime will lead to some potential applications .",
    "several recent developments make the polarization insensitive lens a practical possibility .",
    "some time ago it was shown that a double - periodic array of pairs of parallel gold nanorods will exhibit negative permittivity and permeability in the optical range  @xcite .",
    "another extremely promising material has been previously explored in certain designs of photonic crystals , which can be effectively modelled with anisotropic permittivity and permeability tensors  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the goal to realize the insensitive lens , chiefly lies in reducing the loss of qimm .",
    "practical polarization insensitive lens will require the frequency independent , a great challenge to the designers is to realize the negative material parameters in a wide band .",
    "the recent developments lead us to be optimistic that the polarization insensitive lens can be designed in future .",
    "in conclusion , we have proposed how to employ the qimm slab to create a polarization insensitive lens , in which both e- and h - polarized waves exhibit the same refocusing effect . for",

    "the qimm slab exhibits the significant insensitive effect for both transmitted and evanescent waves .",
