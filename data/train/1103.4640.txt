    "accurate theoretical description of nonequilibrium charge transport in josephson junctions is an important and active research field .",
    "the concept of multiple andreev reflections ( mar ) @xcite is a universal framework explaining the nature of dissipative current in different types of junctions .",
    "the quasiparticles injected in the junction at applied voltage smaller than the superconducting energy gap , @xmath4 , can only escape into reservoirs at zero temperature by multiple traversing the junction due to repeated andreev reflections , each time gaining energy @xmath5 .",
    "such a process generates coherent transfer of multiple electron charge @xmath6 across the junction .",
    "such a mechanism is important at small temperatures when the single particle tunneling is exponentially weak , and the andreev transport becomes dominant .",
    "the most complete quantitative mar theory has been developed for ballistic contacts .",
    "the central element here is the solution for a single conducting channel with given transmissivity , which enters the sum over conducting channels in the net current .",
    "various approaches for constructing such a solution have been developed based on the scattering theory , tunneling hamiltonian , and quasiclassical green s functions.@xcite    extension of the theory has been suggested for disordered weak links , e.g. , diffusive constrictions and superconductor - insulator - superconductor ( sis ) tunnel junctions with disordered insulating layers . in this case",
    "the summation over the channels is performed by taking into account the distribution of random transmission eigenvalues for corresponding structure in the normal state.@xcite this method , however , is only valid for short superconducting weak links , in which the dwell time , i.e. , the time of quasiparticle diffusion along the whole mar staircase , is small on a quantum time scale defined by the inverse order parameter @xmath7 . in junctions with large dwell time ,",
    "e.g. , long superconductor - normal metal - superconductor ( sns ) junctions and double - barrier sinis junctions containing breit - wigner resonances , the method does not work because of strong energy dispersion of the scattering amplitudes .",
    "the electron- and hole - like quasiparticles acquire different scattering phases during propagation through the junction ( electron - hole dephasing ) , which results in the single - channel mar current being dependent on the scattering amplitudes rather than the scattering coefficients.@xcite thus the distribution of transmission eigenvalues becomes irrelevant and is to be replaced by the statistics of scattering amplitudes , which is generally unknown except of some particular cases.@xcite    in order to investigate the mar problem in diffusive junctions with large electron - hole dephasing , one has to directly solve quasiclassical keldysh - green s function equations.@xcite this task , however , is technically demanding because a nonlinearity of equations and nonstationary character of the mar problem lead to hardly tractable two - dimensional infinite chains of green s function harmonics .",
    "so far the problem has been analytically solved for superconducting constrictions,@xcite and for the opposite case of very long sns and sinis junctions , where the josephson current is completely suppressed and a incoherent mar theory can be formulated@xcite analogous to the one for ballistic junctions.@xcite a perturbative scheme for a superconducting film interrupted by a tunnel junction has been suggested,@xcite however no general methods to analytically treat the problem in sns junctions of intermediate lengths exists up to now , and even numerical solution presents a difficult and time consuming task.@xcite    in this paper we present a study of the junction for which the coherent mar problem can be relatively easily solved and fully investigated both analytically and numerically for the entire range from weak to strong electron - hole dephasing .",
    "we consider a sinis junction with opaque nis interfaces having equal resistances @xmath8 much larger than the resistance @xmath9 of the diffusive normal wire , the length @xmath10 of which is supposed to be much smaller than the coherence length @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is the diffusion coefficient , @xmath13 ) . in such junctions , the dwell time @xmath1 is characterized by the parameter@xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the thouless energy .",
    "this parameter defines the amplitude of the josephson current and the magnitude of the minigap in the energy spectrum within the normal wire @xmath16 . in short junctions ,",
    "the thouless energy is large compared to @xmath17 , therefore , the parameter @xmath18 may have arbitrary value depending on the junction length and transparency .",
    "correspondingly , the value of the minigap may vary between @xmath19 and @xmath17 reflecting the crossover from large to small electron - hole dephasing .",
    "we construct the mar solution of the keldysh - green s function equations and evaluate the dc current for arbitrary @xmath18 by means of the second - order recurrences similar to that for ballistic structures.@xcite for the case of small electron - hole dephasing ( @xmath20 ) we show that the current is given by a general formula for mesoscopic connector @xcite [ see eq .",
