    "2d imaging methods , such as optical microscopy , are still preferable to 3d imaging methods due to their high level of specificity and high resolution properties .",

    "typically , a 3d volume is reconstructed by registering ( aligning ) the 2d sections with respect to a chosen reference and stacking successive aligned sections  @xcite .",
    "as the acquisition processes of different 2d histological images are performed independently , slice misalignment and deformation is often unavoidable . figure  [ img : badslices ] shows examples of histological slices with non - cohorent distortions , tears , hole and missing parts .",
    "the deformation varies from section to section and non - cohorent distortions may exist in consecutive sections . choosing an arbitrary slice as a reference slice leads to errors in 3d volume reconstruction , hence , the reference slice should be chosen properly not to contain distortions in order to achive high quality volume reconstruction  @xcite .

    "in this study , we present a novel method for reconstructing 3d rat brain volumes from 2d histological images .",
    "the framework bases on three fundamental premises .",
    "( 1 ) all histological images must be standardized for accurate registration leading to 3d volume reconstruction .",
    "( 2 ) for accurate and succesful registrations in consecutive slices , a reliable feature space must be taken into account .",
    "( 3 ) for automatic 3d volume reconstruction , the reference slice must be chosen properly by avoiding slices with high noise , distortions and other factors . to validate the reconstructed volume ,",
    "the smoothness of the volume is considered .",
    "experimental results indicate that the reconstructed volume is highly accurate .",

    "<S> in this paper , we propose three novel and important methods for the registration of histological images for 3d reconstruction . </S>",
    "<S> first , possible intensity variations and nonstandardness in images are corrected by an intensity standardization process which maps the image scale into a standard scale where the similar intensities correspond to similar tissues meaning . </S>",
    "<S> second , 2d histological images are mapped into a feature space where continuous variables are used as high confidence image features for accurate registration . </S>",
    "<S> third , we propose an automatic best reference slice selection algorithm that improves reconstruction quality based on both image entropy and mean square error of the registration process . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the choice of reference slice has a significant impact on registration error , standardization , feature space and entropy information . </S>",
    "<S> after 2d histological slices are registered through an affine transformation with respect to an automatically chosen reference , the 3d volume is reconstructed by co - registering 2d slices elastically . </S>"
