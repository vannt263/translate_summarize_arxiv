    "we consider the following two - higgs - doublet model ( 2hdm ) potential , with quartic and quadratic terms separated @xcite : @xmath5 + \\bigl\\{\\bigl[\\lambda_6(\\phi_1^\\dagger\\phi_1 ) + \\lambda_7(\\phi_2^\\dagger\\phi_2)\\bigr](\\phi_1^\\dagger\\phi_2 ) + { \\rm h.c.}\\bigr\\ } \\nonumber\\\\ & -\\bigl\\{m_{11}^2(\\phi_1^\\dagger\\phi_1 ) + { \\bigl[m_{12}^2 ( \\phi_1^\\dagger\\phi_2)+{\\rm h.c.}\\bigr ] } + m_{22}^2(\\phi_2^\\dagger\\phi_2)\\bigr\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as is well known , both cp violation in the higgs sector and flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) can be suppressed by imposing a @xmath6 symmetry @xcite . this requires symmetry of the potential under ( @xmath7 ) ( or vice versa ) , which implies @xmath8 .",
    "we shall allow _ soft _  violation of this symmetry , i.e. , we take @xmath9 , but allow @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "a simple discussion can be given for this case , in which @xmath11 signals cp violation .",
    "we shall now consider the simpler case of @xmath9 , and parametrize the minimum of the potential ( or vacuum ) as @xmath13 naively , the phase @xmath14 violates @xmath12 , but it can be removed by a global phase transformation on the field @xmath15 , together with the phases of @xmath16 , @xmath0 and the fermion fields @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to define @xmath17 the phase @xmath14 can be found from the equation @xmath18 making use of the rephasing invariance @xcite , we put @xmath19 . with this choice , eq .",
    "( [ constr ] ) becomes a constraint for the relation of @xmath20 to @xmath21 .",
    "the neutral sector has a mass squared matrix of the form @xmath22 { \\cal m}_{12}^2 & { \\cal m}_{22}^2 & -{{\\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}}}\\im\\lambda_5v^2\\cos\\beta\\\\[4pt ] -{{\\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}}}\\im\\lambda_5v^2\\sin\\beta &   -{{\\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}}}\\im\\lambda_5v^2\\cos\\beta & { \\cal m}_{33}^2 \\end{array}\\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the same as in the cp - conserving case .",
    "when @xmath27 , there is no @xmath12 violation , the matrix ( [ eq : mass - squared ] ) is block diagonal , and the physical states are @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "when @xmath31 , all three neutral higgs states mix ; we denote them by @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the mass - squared matrix may be diagonalized via a rotation matrix , defined by @xmath35 in the limit of weak @xmath12 violation , the masses for @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 will deviate from those of @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 by terms quadratic in @xmath21 .",
    "we shall here consider the scenario of weak ( or no ) @xmath12 violation and large masses of higgs particles except one , namely @xmath36 .",
    "let us discuss how large masses @xmath37 ( close to @xmath38 ) and @xmath39 arise in such a case .",
    "the potential ( [ eq : pot ] ) ( but with @xmath9 ) gives @xmath40.\\ ] ] there are two rather distinct mechanisms for obtaining large mass @xmath41 and @xmath42 : either _ ( i ) _",
    "@xmath4 is large ( this is extensively discussed by haber as _ the decoupling scenario _ ) @xcite , or _",
    "( ii ) _ @xmath4 is small , whereas @xmath43 is `` large '' @xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "there are obvious upper bounds ( from perturbativity and positivity ) on how large @xmath43 can be .",
    "decoupling properties of the two - higgs - doublet model were studied in @xcite .    in this model , with weak ( or no )",
    "@xmath12 violation , one can realize a standard - model - like scenario :    * there is a light higgs boson with couplings to the up ( e.g.  @xmath44 ) and down ( e.g.  @xmath45 ) type quarks , and to @xmath46 and @xmath47 , like in the standard model , @xmath48 * the other higgs bosons are heavy , @xmath49 .    within the two - higgs - doublet model ,",
    "this scenario can be realized in two distinct ways .",
    "they are @xcite :    * solutions  a. all basic couplings are approximately the same as in the sm , up to an overall sign . * solutions  b. like solutions  a , _ except that the couplings to either up- or down - type quarks have opposite signs of those in the sm .",
    "_ this case can not be realized in the decoupling scenario .",
    "let us now be more specific , and consider the so - called model  ii for yukawa couplings , where masses of down- and up - type quarks originate from couplings to @xmath50 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "we denote by @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 the ratios of the higgs couplings to @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( @xmath54 ) and to up and down - type quarks , with respect to those of the standard model .",
    "in particular , for the yukawa couplings these ratios can be expressed via elements of the rotational matrix @xmath55 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : r ] ) as @xmath56 , \\qquad \\chi_d^{h_i}=\\frac{1}{\\cos\\beta}[r_{i1}-i\\gamma_5\\sin\\beta r_{i3 } ] , \\label{fermcoupl}\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is proportional to @xmath21 .",
    "note that in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ fermcoupl ] ) , the @xmath12 violation induced by higgs exchange in @xmath58 production @xcite provides information on @xmath21 .      in the cp - conserving case ,",
    "even with all basic couplings being the same ( up to a sign ) as in the sm ( 8) , loop - induced transition rates , like @xmath60 , may differ from the sm prediction .",
    "this is due to the different behaviors of the trilinear higgs coupling @xmath61 for small and large @xmath62 .",
    "in fact , the ratio of this coupling to its sm value can be written as @xmath63 thus , if @xmath64 , there is no effect in @xmath65 , whereas if @xmath66 there is a difference of several per cent , as illustrated in fig .  1 ( left panel ) for the case of solutions  a @xcite .",
