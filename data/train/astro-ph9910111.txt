    "the role of novae as potential gamma - ray emitters has been mentioned long ago ( clayton & hoyle 1974 , clayton 1981 , leising & clayton 1987 ) , and analyzed in detail on the basis of theoretical models just recently ( gmez - gomar et al . 1998 ) . in many of the historical studies ,",
    "more attention has been paid to the long lasting emission , related to the decay of some medium - lived isotopes , such as @xmath2be ( @xmath3=77days ) , @xmath4na ( @xmath3=3.75yr ) , and to the possible contribution of novae to the galactic content of @xmath5al ( @xmath6 yr ) . up to now , no positive detection neither of the 478 kev emission ( harris et al .",
    "1991 ) , related to @xmath2be decay , nor of the 1275 kev one ( iyudin et al .",
    "1995 ) , related to @xmath4na decay , has been obtained . the 1809 kev line associated with the galactic @xmath5al",
    "was detected some years ago by the heao3 , high energy astrophysics observatory ( mahoney et al .",
    "1982 ) , but observations made with the comptel ( compton telescope ) instrument on board the cgro satellite ( compton gamma - ray observatory ) seem to indicate that the @xmath5al emission is more related to a young population of massive stars , although a nova contribution can not be ruled out yet ( diehl et al .",
    "1995 , prantzos & diehl , 1996 ) .",
    "the most powerful emission in gamma - rays from classical novae is not the one related to the 478 , 1275 or 1809 kev lines , but that at 511 kev and below ( down to @xmath7(20 - 30 ) kev ) , which originates from electron - positron annihilation ( hernanz et al . 1997a , b , gmez - gomar et al .",
    "1998 ) , and consists of a line at 511 kev and a continuum below it .",
    "the 511 kev line comes from the direct annihilation of positrons and from the positronium ( in singlet state ) emission , whereas the continuum comes from both the positronium continuum ( triplet state positronium ) and the comptonization of photons emitted in the 511 kev line .",
    "the main contributors to positrons in nova envelopes are the short - lived @xmath8n ( @xmath3=862s ) and @xmath1f ( @xmath3=158 min ) , besides the long - lived @xmath4na ( this one only in oxygen - neon novae ) .",
    "the problem with this emission is its very short duration , making its detection very difficult .",
    "furthermore , because of the short lifetimes of @xmath8n and @xmath1f , its maximum happens well before the maximum in visual light , which still enhances the difficulty of detection .",
    "when @xmath8n decays , the nova envelope is still too opaque ; therefore , @xmath1f plays the most important role , since it decays appreciably when the envelope begins to be transparent enough to allow for the gamma - ray photons to be transported through the whole envelope , and then be emitted into space .",
    "several attempts are being carried out to detect the annihilation gamma - ray emission from novae , with instruments like batse ( burst and transient source experiment ) on board the cgro , or tgrs ( transient gamma ray spectrometer ) , on board the wind satellite .",
    "spi , the future spectrometrer for integral ( international gamma - ray laboratory ) , could in favorable conditions detect that emission .",
    "the detectability distances for these instruments , or for any future ones , rely on the detailed properties of novae expanding envelopes and , in particular , on their @xmath1f content , which strongly depends on the rates of the nuclear reactions involved in its synthesis . a good knowledge of the gamma - ray output of novae is needed to elucidate the possibilities of detection and to put constraints on the theoretical models from the observations .",
    "the flux emitted by a classical nova in the gamma - ray range below 511 kev depends on the amount of @xmath1f at the epoch where the envelope begins to be transparent to gamma - rays .",
    "therefore , profiles of @xmath1f along the expanding envelope at different times are needed to compute the spectrum at different epochs after the outburst ( or in an equivalent way , the light curves for different gamma - ray bands at and below 511 kev ) .",
    "of course , the whole spectrum depends also on the abundances of the other isotopes and on the density and velocity profiles ; these quantities determine the number of interactions of photons with the ejecta through compton scattering , photoelectric absorption and pair production .",
    "theoretical models of the gamma - ray emission from individual classical novae , based on the nucleosynthetic yields obtained from a hydrodynamical code that follows the explosive phase and the related nucleosynthesis ( jos & hernanz 1998 ) , predict an intense line emission at 511 kev plus a continuum below ( gmez - gomar et al .",
    "the emission appears between 5 and 6 hours after maximum temperature , i.e. , some days before the maximum in visual luminosity .",
    "the continuum displays always a cut - off at low energies , which is related to photoelectric absorption , which has larger cross sections than compton scattering at low energy , acting as a sink of the comptonized photons .",
    "the cut - off is located at @xmath720 kev , for the carbon - oxygen ( co ) and @xmath730 kev for the oxygen - neon ( one ) rich envelopes typical of nova models .",
    "the main nuclear path leading to @xmath1f synthesis in novae belongs to the hot cno ( carbon - nitrogen - oxygen ) cycles . since in both co and",
    "one novae the initial abundance of @xmath9o is large , @xmath9o is the main source for @xmath1f formation , through two possible chains of reactions : @xmath9o ( p,@xmath0)@xmath10f ( p,@xmath0)@xmath1ne(@xmath11)@xmath1f and @xmath9o ( p,@xmath0)@xmath10f ( @xmath11)@xmath10o(p,@xmath0)@xmath1f .",
    "however , @xmath1f yields are severely constrained by its destruction mode , whatever the production channel is . during the thermonuclear runaway , @xmath1f destruction by beta decays",
    "can be neglected when compared to its destruction by proton captures .",
    "because of the low alpha emission threshold , @xmath1f ( p,@xmath12)@xmath13o is faster than @xmath1f ( p,@xmath0)@xmath14ne , and hence it is the main destruction channel of @xmath1f ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the rates for @xmath1f ( p,@xmath0 ) and @xmath1f ( p,@xmath12 ) generally adopted in nova models are those from wiescher & kettner ( 1982 ) , which were estimated at a time where the relevant experimental data were scarce ( i.e. , very limited spectroscopic data was available for @xmath14ne ) .",
    "thanks to recent measurements , in particular to those of graulich et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , utku et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and references therein , it is possible now to use updated rates .",
    "two resonance strengths have been measured directly ( coszach et al . 1995 , graulich et al . 1997 ) in @xmath1f ( p,@xmath12 ) using a radioactive @xmath1f  beam .",
    "of these two , the one lying at higher energy is so broad that its tail alone gives a contribution larger than the wiescher & kettner ( 1982 ) rate at nova temperatures .",
    "nuclear spectroscopic studies performed by utku et al .",
    "( 1998 ) have led to the localisation of several new @xmath14ne levels to which should correspond new resonances in @xmath1f + p. they have calculated updated @xmath1f ( p,@xmath0 ) and @xmath1f ( p,@xmath12 ) rates including the two directly measured resonances plus the contribution of the expected ones . to calculate this last contribution , they used information about @xmath14f analog levels supplemented with estimated quantities .",
    "a comparison of the new rates with those of wiescher and kettner is shown in figure 1 ; in the range of temperatures relevant to nova explosions , the new rates are quite larger than the older ones .",
    "although the uncertainties associated with the rates of @xmath1f destruction , @xmath1f ( p,@xmath0 ) and @xmath1f ( p,@xmath12 ) , are far from being settled in the nova temperature range , it seems clear that the rates that had been used up to now ( wiescher & kettner , 1982 ) were underestimated .    in table 1",
    "we show the most relevant properties of some nova models computed by means of the hydrodynamic code described in jos & hernanz ( 1998 ) , with the nuclear reaction network described in jos et al .",
    "( 1999 ) ( recommended rates ) and the new utku s rates for @xmath1f ( p,@xmath0 ) and @xmath1f ( p,@xmath12 ) reactions .",
    "we have chosen models representative of the two nova types , co and one , and with masses 1.15 m@xmath15 in the co case and 1.15 and 1.25 m@xmath15 in the one case , in order to analyze the influence of the composition and mass of the underlying white dwarf on @xmath1f synthesis .",
    "the accretion rate in all the cases is @xmath16 m@xmath15.yr@xmath17 and the degree of mixing with the core is 50% ( see jos & hernanz 1998 for a discussion of the initial mixing effect ) .",
    "similar ejected masses of @xmath8n and @xmath1f are obtained in all the models , which is not the case for other radioactive nuclei relevant to @xmath0-ray emission with longer timescales , such as @xmath2be ( mainly produced in co novae ) and @xmath4na and @xmath5al ( mainly synthesized in one novae ) . when compared with results with the old rates for @xmath1f + p reactions ,",
    "a general reduction , by a factor between 10 and 20 , of @xmath1f yields is present , whereas the maximum temperature and the mean kinetic energy are almost unchanged , since the @xmath1f + p reactions do not affect the energetics of the nova explosion .",
    "concerning the general nucleosynthesis , the changes are not very relevant , except for @xmath14f , which is reduced typically by a factor of 10 .",
    "the gamma - ray spectrum 12 hours after peak temperature is shown in figure 2 , for a co nova of 1.15 m@xmath15 and an one nova of 1.25 m@xmath15 at a distance of 1 kpc .",
    "the 511 kev line from our models is slightly blueshifted ( with a maximum energy of 517 kev ) during the first phases , and has a moderate width ( from @xmath75 to @xmath78 kev , fwhm , depending on the model and on the epoch ) .",
    "light curves in the 20 - 511 kev band and in the 511 kev line alone have been computed .",
    "a summary of their fluxes at different epochs after peak temperature , for a distance of 1 kpc , is shown in table 2 .",
    "there is an early maximum at around 1 hour , which is related to @xmath8n decay .",
    "this maximum has very short duration and is very dependent on the distribution of @xmath8n in the outer layers of the envelope ( which are the only ones seen at these early epochs ) . a larger abundance of @xmath8n in the outer layers of the co nova with respect to the one one leads to the larger flux in the co case ( see table 2 ) .",
    "the flux reaches its second and broader maximum , related to @xmath1f decay , at around 6 hours after peak temperature .",
    "it is important to notice that the flux emitted in the continuum , with a maximum around 50 kev , is larger than that in the line at all times .",
    "also , the clear cut - off at @xmath720 kev , together with the short duration of the whole emission and its early appearence before maximum visual luminosity , rules out the interpretation of the early hard x - ray emission observations of nova herculis 1991 ( lloyd et al .",
    "1992 ) , and of the recent nova velorum 1999 ( orio et al . 1999 ,",
    "mukai & ishida 1999 ) , as a comptonization of the gamma - ray emission ( livio et al .",
    "1992 , starrfield et al .",
    "for the purpose of comparison , the gamma - ray spectrum of the co nova model , but computed with the old @xmath1f + p rates , is also shown in figure 2 .",
    "a reduction by a factor of @xmath710 at all the energies in the relevant range is obtained in the new models , since the fluxes are smaller than the previous ones by the same factors than @xmath1f ejected masses ( between 10 and 20 ) .",
    "this difference appears during the first 24 hours , when @xmath1f is the main source of positrons ; but later on , when only @xmath4na remains as a positron source , the new and the old fluxes are quite similar , being much smaller in co novae because they are almost devoid of @xmath4na .",
    "the potential detection of the electron - positron annihilation emission from classical novae is faced with various challenging problems : besides of the relatively small fluxes , the short duration and the early appearence of the emission make its detection quite hard .",
    "large field of view intruments , like batse , are the more appropriate to detect this type of emission . its capability to observe all the sky , together with its high sensitivity in the low - energy range make batse an ideal instrument to detect this emission , although the new fluxes presented here restrict the detectability distances to less than 3 kpc .",
    "there is an ongoing project of analysis of batse background data for nearby novae that have exploded since cgro launch .",
    "another instrument which could be able to detect the annihilation gamma - ray emission from novae , because of both its wide field of view and its high spectral resolution , is the transient gamma ray spectrometer ( tgrs ) on board the wind satellite ( teegarden et al . 1996 ) .",
    "very recently , harris et al . ( 1999 ) have tried to detect the annihilation line emission at 511 kev from the five known galactic novae in the instrument field of view , during the time interval 1995 - 1997 .",
    "no definite detections were made , but the method applied was shown to be sensitive enough to detect novae out to about 2.5 kpc . since the conclusions of that paper were based on models in gmez - gomar et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , they should be revised and the corresponding distances should be reduced by a factor @xmath18 .    finally , we should mention the future spectrometer for integral , spi , which could be able to detect the 511 kev line up to 3 kpc with the fluxes we obtain now .",
    "a similar detectability distance is predicted for the continuum .",
    "it is worth noticing that both tgrs and spi have very good spectral resolution , because of their germanium detectors ; this of course is favorable for the detection of the 511 kev line ( although its non negligible width worsens the sensitivity appreciably ) but not so interesting for the continuum , where novae emit a larger flux .",
    "the detection by some present or future instrument of the positron annihilation emission from novae would help to understand the mechanism of the explosion and the dynamics of the early expansion stage .",
