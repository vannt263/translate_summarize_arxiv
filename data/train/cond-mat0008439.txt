    "recent experiments on disordered superconducting wires@xcite have led to renewed interest in the interplay of interaction and disorder in low - dimensional systems .",
    "these experiments have been made possible by the development of fabrication techniques using either stencils or carbon nanotubes , and involve wires of width as low as @xmath0 and thickness as low as @xmath1 . an obvious question to ask in such systems",
    "is how the transition temperature is affected by wire width and thickness . decreasing the thickness of the wire increases the normal state resistance per square which is a measure of the amount of disorder in the system .",
    "this increase in disorder reduces the transition temperature by causing the electrons to move diffusively rather than ballistically , as discussed below . decreasing the width of the wire leads to a crossover from two- to one - dimensional behavior , where increased fluctuation effects",
    "further reduce the transition temperature .",
    "ultimately the combined disorder and fluctuation effects completely suppress superconductivity , and a superconductor - insulator transition results@xcite .",
    "the effect of dimensionality on this quantum phase transition is obviously very interesting from a theoretical point of view . as a first step to understanding this transition , we will compare predictions of transition temperature to experimental results .",
    "unfortunately there is very little data available for comparison because each data point requires the fabrication of a new wire which is very costly in terms of experimental effort .",
    "we therefore suggest the application of a perpendicular magnetic field as a way to generate more data points for each wire and make predictions for this effect .    the most basic model used@xcite consists of electrons moving in a disordered background interacting via the coulomb repulsion and a featureless phonon - mediated attraction .",
    "simple as this model is , significant difficulties arise even when calculating the suppression of transition temperature in two - dimensional films .",
    "these difficulties will be compounded when looking at quasi one - dimensional wires , which are in a crossover regime , so it is most important that they are fully understood in the simpler two - dimensional case .",
    "the basic physics involved is not in dispute , and can be understood from the bcs - macmillan formula for the transition temperature , @xmath2 , @xmath3}\\right)},\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the debye frequency ( a typical phonon frequency ) , @xmath5 is the electronic density of states per spin at the fermi surface , @xmath6 is the featureless attraction , and @xmath7 is the coulomb pseudopotential , a measure of the coulomb repulsion .",
    "the disorder causes the electrons to move diffusively rather than ballistically making them less efficient at screening the coulomb repulsion .",
    "this increases @xmath7 and decreases @xmath5 , both effects leading to a decrease in @xmath2 .",
    "we shall assume that the disorder does not affect phonon properties such as @xmath4 and @xmath6 , an assumption that is backed up by detailed calculation on at least one model of electron - phonon interaction@xcite .",
    "other authors@xcite have questioned this assumption , and we intend to address this point in future work .    the first difficulty which occurs in two dimensions relates to the low - momentum singularity of the disorder - screened coulomb potential , which is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the thomas - fermi screening wavenumber defined by @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the diffusion constant , @xmath12 is the fermi velocity , and @xmath13 is the elastic scattering time .",
    "this singularity leads to a strong suppression of the one - particle density of states@xcite which is seen experimentally in tunneling measurements@xcite . naively inserting this density of states into eqn .",
    "[ [ bcs ] ] predicts a large suppression of @xmath2 which is not seen experimentally .",
    "this prediction is , in fact , incorrect due to a cancellation@xcite between the various diagrammatic contributions in perturbation theory .",
    "the apparently mysterious cancellation turns out to be due to gauge invariance@xcite and is thus expected to be a very robust phenomenon .",
    "the end result is that the coulomb interaction is effectively featureless with strength @xmath14 .",
    "the fact that we can legitimately use a featureless interaction makes calculations much simpler .",
    "our first task is therefore to check that this replacement is still valid in quasi-1d systems .",
    "the other difficulty is that perturbation theory can not take us to the superconductor - insulator transition as it is only valid for weak disorder , and _ ad hoc _ attempts to extend its range of validity lead to unphysical reentrance problems .",
    "oreg and finkelstein@xcite overcame this problem by developing a resummation technique , which has recently been shown to be related to strong - coupling theory@xcite .",
    "we reexamine their predictions for wires , and find , rather surprisingly , that the problem is extremely sensitive to the boundary conditions used .",
    "this unexpected sensitivity leads us to check all details and approximations used in the resummation technique . upon satisfactorily completing the necessary checks , we compare theory and experiment .",
    "although good agreement is obtained when we focus on the suppression of @xmath2 due to increasing disorder , it is less good when we focus on the additional suppression due to decreasing wire width .",
    "this is largely due to the limited amount of experimental data ( only about four data points for each of four wire widths ) .",
    "we propose the application of a perpendicular magnetic field as a means of generating more data with a minimum of effort .",
    "we extend the resummation technique to include a magnetic field , and make predictions for transition temperature as a function of magnetic field for different wire widths and thicknesses .",
    "the most interesting feature which emerges is a crossover from two- to one - dimensional behavior which can be tuned by either decreasing wire width or increasing the resistance per square .",
    "we hope that the appropriate experiments will be carried out in the near future .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organised in the following manner . in section ( ii )",
    "we consider first - order perturbation theory in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "this is the simplest approach possible , and we will use it as a testing ground for the validity of the approximations used . specifically we will show that it is legitimate to use a featureless coulomb interaction and ignore self - energy effects , but that the details of boundary conditions are important . in section ( iii ) we make predictions for the transition temperature using the resummation technique , all the necessary approximations having been justified in section ( ii ) , and then compare theory and experiment . in section ( iv ) we consider the effect of an applied magnetic field on the transition temperature .",
    "the dimensions of the wires are such that we must consider both orbital and zeeman ( spin ) effects@xcite . as",
    "yet there is no experimental data available for comparison to the theory .",
    "we will now calculate the transition temperature , @xmath2 , which we identify as the temperature at which the pair propagator , @xmath15 , diverges .",
    "the latter is defined in fig .",
    "1(a ) in terms of the bcs interaction , @xmath6 , and the pair polarization function , @xmath16 , by @xmath17 let us first consider mean field theory , which corresponds to zeroth order in disorder perturbation theory , for which the expansion parameter is @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the fermi wavenumber and @xmath20 is the elastic mean free path . the mean field pair polarization function is shown in fig .",

    "1(c ) can be understood in physical terms : diagrams 1 and 2 are self - energy diagrams and give corrections to the electronic density of states , @xmath5 ; diagrams 3 and 4 are pseudopotential diagrams and give corrections to the effective coulomb repulsion , @xmath7 ; diagram 5 involves the effect of coulomb interaction on superconducting fluctuations .",
    "we will first perform the calculations exactly , and demonstrate the cancellation of the low - momentum singularity in the coulomb interaction which occurs between diagrams 14 and 5 .",
    "we show that this is equivalent to considering only diagrams 14 with a featureless coulomb interaction of strength @xmath14 .",
    "in other words , the only purpose of diagram 5 is to remove the low - momentum singularity , as required by gauge invariance .",
    "finally we show that the self - energy diagrams 1 and 2 can be ignored as they give a much smaller contribution than diagrams 3 and 4 .",

    "note that there is , in fact , no divergence at @xmath37 , but this can only be seen by taylor expanding to second order .",
    "the need to perform this expansion makes the calculation involved , especially at the level of numerics .",

    "we have to decide which boundary conditions to use in the transverse direction .",

    "it follows that @xmath78 does not depend upon the relative sign of @xmath79 and @xmath80 and has the form @xmath81 where @xmath82 is defined in eqn .",

    "the only minor complication is that the matrix @xmath95 depends upon @xmath96 both through the dependence of @xmath97 upon @xmath96 and through its rank @xmath41 .",

    "their data shows that the relative suppression of @xmath2 varies as @xmath102 with a proportionality constant independent of @xmath58 .",
    "we have performed calculations which predict a dependence roughly of the form @xmath103 , but with a proportionality constant dependent on @xmath58 .",
    "we will therefore not consider this data further .",
    "the data of sharifi et al and xiong et al are both of the form of @xmath104 vs @xmath58 for wires of different width , but only the latter shows a consistent trend with decreasing width , so it is only this data that we shall attempt to fit .",
    "the fact that this is the most recent data is reassuring , since it suggests that more recent fabrication techniques have produced better quality wires .    in fig .",
    "3 we compare the data of xiong et al with our theoretical predictions . in doing this",
    "we encounter two difficulties .",
    "the first is that experiment and theory do not agree for some of the 2d films used .",
    "we assume that this is due to some additional physical processes that will affect samples in the same manner independent of width .",
    "we therefore multiply our theoretical predictions by @xmath105 to factor out this effect .",
    "the second difficulty is that wires of different widths do not appear to have the same value of @xmath2 in the clean limit , @xmath106 .",
    "we therefore assume a different @xmath106 for each wire . upon making these two assumptions ,",
    "we see that the agreement between theory and experiment is good . however plotting the data in this form",
    "emphasises the suppression of transition temperature due to disorder , whereas we are interested in the additional suppression due to the decrease in width . for this reason we need to replot the data to emphasise this latter point .    in fig .",
    "4 we replot fig . 3 in terms of the _ additional relative _ suppression , @xmath107 , which is defined by @xmath108 this quantity focuses on the basic physical phenomenon we are interested in  the additional suppression of transition temperature caused by the reduced dimensionality in the quasi-1d wires .",
    "it has the additional benefit of factoring out the two difficulties discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "when plotted in this form , the agreement between theory and experiment no longer appears to be as good .",
    "this is because our theory , and indeed any theory , predicts a smooth dimensional crossover whereas the experimental data shows an abrupt crossover between the 2d film and the @xmath109 wire , which lie on one curve , and the @xmath110 wires , which lie on a different curve .",
    "the fact that the data for the three narrowest wires fall on top of each other might be due to them having the same effective dimensionless width @xmath69 .",
    "if we allowed ourselves the additional freedom of fitting this parameter separately for each wire , we would obtain good agreement between theory and experiment , but we do not believe this is justified .",
    "we have used the value of the thermal length quoted in sharifi et al ( viz @xmath111 at @xmath112 , which corresponds to @xmath113 at @xmath114 ) .",
    "the basic problem is clearly that there is not enough experimental data available  there are only 19 points in total , and each of these corresponds to a different wire . to carry out a more systematic comparison between theory and experiment",
    ", one would need wires of many different resistances ( thicknesses ) for each value of width .",
    "this would , however , be very costly in terms of experimental effort . a less costly method for generating more data",
    "would be to apply a magnetic field to a given wire .",
    "we therefore extend our theory to include the effect of such a field in the next section .",
    "we will now consider the effect of an applied perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "there are two effects to consider here : the _ orbital _ effect , caused by the magnetic field scrambling the relative phase of the electrons in a cooper pair , and the _ zeeman _ effect , caused by the magnetic field lifting the degeneracy of up and down spins .",
    "let us first consider the relative importance of the two effects .",

    "there are two asymptotic limits where @xmath115 is easily determined : the 2d limit , where the problem becomes that of a simple harmonic oscillator , with @xmath135 ; and the 1d limit , where the eigenfunction is simply a constant , and hence ( using perturbation theory ) @xmath136 .",
    "the 2d to 1d crossover occurs when the width , @xmath28 , is of the order of the magnetic length , @xmath137 , which occurs at the field @xmath138 . at larger magnetic fields",

    "in this paper we have considered the effect of localization and interaction on transition temperature in ultranarrow superconducting wires .",
    "our main conclusion is that , taking into account the relatively small amount of experimental data , theory and experiment are consistent with each other .",
    "the agreement is not perfect : the experimental data seems to show a very sudden crossover from 2d to 1d behavior when the wire width becomes of the order of the thermal length , whilst theory predicts a smooth crossover . indeed ,",

    "we have therefore made predictions for magnetic field dependence of transition temperature in wires of varying width and resistance in the hope that such measurements will be made in the future .",
    "our main prediction is of a change in the shape of the reduced @xmath134 curves due to the dimensional crossover .",
    "this may be tuned either by varying wire width or resistance .",
    "our work is based on the resummation technique developed by oreg and finkelstein@xcite , which is a very powerful method of going beyond perturbation theory , and hence giving believable results at strong disorder .",
    "the suppression of the transition temperature is very sensitive to boundary conditions , due to the different relative weights of the zero momentum mode .",
    "we have used the physically correct zero - gradient boundary conditions in our work .",
    "the unexpected strong dependence of results on boundary conditions led us to worry about all details of the calculation .",
    "we therefore also investigated the effects of using a featureless coulomb interaction instead of the exact one , ignoring self - energy contributions , and solving the of matrix equation exactly instead of using an approximate method .",
    "we found that it is legitimate to use a featureless coulomb interaction and ignore self - energy contributions , but that our matrix equations should be solved by exact diagonalization ( which in any case is no more difficult ) .    in our calculations of the magnetic field dependence of transition temperature , we find that the orbital effect is the most important , and can be treated by replacing the @xmath140 terms in the momentum dependent pair propagator , @xmath185 , by twice the magnetic dephasing rate , @xmath133 .",
    "the latter is the lowest eigenvalue of the minimally coupled cooperon operator , and must be found numerically .",
    "the zeeman splitting is found to have a non - negligible effect only at the mean field level , and even this effect is small .",
