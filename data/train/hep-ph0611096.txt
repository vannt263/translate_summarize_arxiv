    "at energies corresponding to a length scale of the order of the hadron size the standard perturbative qcd can not be applied , because the coupling constant is too large . in the nonperturbative regime",
    "one can use the so - called @xmath0 expansion approach which is based on the 32 years old idea of t hooft @xcite , who suggested a perturbative expansion of qcd in terms of the parameter @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the number of colors . the double line diagrammatic method proposed by t hooft",
    "has been implemented by witten @xcite to describe hadrons by using convenient power counting rules for feynman diagrams . according to witten s intuitive picture ,",
    "a baryon containing @xmath1 quarks is seen as a bound state in an average self - consistent potential of a hartree type and the corrections to the hartree approximation are of order @xmath0 which means that in the @xmath2 limit the hartree approximation is exact .",
    "ground state baryons correspond to the ground state of the average potential .",
    "ten years after t hooft s work , gervais and sakita @xcite and independently dashen and manohar in 1993 @xcite discovered that qcd has an exact contracted su(2@xmath3)@xmath4 symmetry when @xmath5 , @xmath3 being the number of flavors .",
    "the contracted algebra generators acting in the spin - flavour space @xmath6 are related to the su(2@xmath3 ) generators @xmath7 in the limit @xmath8 by @xmath9 for ground state baryons",
    "the su(2@xmath3 ) symmetry is broken by corrections proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "applications to ground state qcd baryons ( @xmath1 = 3 ) were considered since 1993 - 1994 .",
    "presently the @xmath0 expansion provides a systematic method to analyze baryon properties such as masses , magnetic moments , axial currents , etc .",
    "the @xmath0 expansion method has been extended to excited states since 1997 in the spirit of the hartree approximation developed by witten @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the su(@xmath10 ) breaking occurs at order @xmath11 , at variance with the ground state .",
    "this conflict generated a conceptual problem , presently under investigation .",
    "here we are concerned with baryon spectra only . if the su(@xmath3 ) symmetry is exact , the baryon mass operator is a linear combination of terms @xmath12 with the operators @xmath13 having the general form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a @xmath16-rank tensor in so(3 ) and @xmath17 a @xmath16-rank tensor in su(2 ) , but invariant in su(@xmath3 ) .",
    "the latter is expressed in terms of su(@xmath3 ) generators .",
    "for the ground state one has @xmath16 = 0 .",
    "the first factor gives the order @xmath18 of the operator in the series expansion and reflects witten s power counting rules .",
    "the lower index @xmath19 represents a specific combination of generators , see examples below . in the linear combination , eq .",
    "( [ massoperator ] ) , each term of type ( [ olfs ] ) is multiplied by an unknown coefficient @xmath20 which is a reduced matrix element .",
    "all these coefficients encode the qcd dynamics and are obtained from a fit to the existing data .",
    "it is important to find regularities in their behaviour , as shown below .",
    "additional terms are needed if su(@xmath3 ) is broken , as it is the case for @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "one expects t hooft s suggestion @xcite to hold in all qcd regimes .",
    "accordingly , the applicability of the @xmath0 expansion method to excited states is a subject of current investigation .",
    "the experimental facts indicate a small breaking of su(6 ) which make the @xmath0 studies of excited states entirely plausible .",
    "the general form of a mass operator is given by eq .",
    "( [ massoperator ] ) with @xmath13 defined as in eq .",
    "( [ olfs ] ) . for simplicity , here we discuss nonstrange baryons where su(4 )",
    "symmetry is exact .",
    "excited baryons can be divided into su(6 ) multiplets , as in the constituent quark model .",
    "if an excited baryon belongs to the @xmath36$]-plet the mass problem can be treated similarly to the ground state in the flavour - spin degrees of freedom , but one has to take into account the presence of an orbital excitation in the space part of the wave function @xcite . if the baryon belongs to the mixed symmetric representation @xmath37 $ ] , or @xmath38 $ ] in su(6 ) notation , the treatment becomes much more complicated .",
    "in particular , the resonances up to 2 gev belong to @xmath39 $ ] , @xmath40 $ ] or @xmath41 $ ] multiplets .",
    "there is one standard way to study the @xmath38$]-plets which is related to the hartree approximation @xcite .",
    "this consists in reducing the description of an excited baryon to that of an excited quark coupled to a symmetric core , see _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite . in that case",
    "the core can be treated in a way similar to that of the ground state . in this method",
    "each su(@xmath10 ) @xmath42 o(3 ) generator is splitted into two terms @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the excited quark operators and @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 the corresponding core operators . as an example",
    ", we discuss the latest in date results , for nonstrange baryons belonging to the @xmath52 $ ] multiplets with @xmath53 = 0 and 2 .",
    "the list of the dominant operators up to order @xmath0 is given in table 1 together with the values of the coefficients @xmath20 obtained from the data .",
    "it is customary to drop corrections of order @xmath54 . in this list ,",
    "the first is the trivial operator of order @xmath55 .",
    "the second is the 1-body part of the spin - orbit operator of order @xmath56 which acts on the excited quark .",
    "the third is a composite 2-body operator formally of order @xmath56 as well .",
    "it involves the tensor operator @xmath57 acting on the excited quark and the su(6 ) generators @xmath46 acting on the excited quark and @xmath58 acting on the core .",
    "the latter is a coherent operator which introduces an extra power @xmath1 so that the order of @xmath59 is @xmath56 .",
    ".list of operators and the coefficients resulting from the fit of nonstrange baryon masses assumed to belong to the @xmath40$]- and @xmath41$]-plets .",
    "the fit gave @xmath60  @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,>,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this procedure , there are two major drawbacks , related to each other .",
    "the first is that the number of linearly independent operators constructed from the generators given in the right - hand side of eqs .",
    "( [ core ] ) increases tremendously so that the number of coefficients to be determined becomes much larger than the experimental data available .",
    "consequently , in selecting the most dominant operators one has to make an arbitrary choice , as we did in table [ operators ] , similarly to previous literature .",

    "a solution to this problem has been found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the separation into a symmetric core and an excited quark is avoided through the calculation of the matrix elements of the su(4 ) generators by using a generalized wigner - eckart theorem @xcite . in this way the antisymmetry is properly taken into account .",
    "the result is that the @xmath0 expansion starts at order @xmath0 , as for the ground state .",
    "based on group theory arguments it is expected that the mass splitting starts at order @xmath0 , as a general rule , irrespective of the angular momentum and parity of the state and also of the number of flavours , provided su(@xmath3 ) is an exact symmetry .    despite the drawbacks of the splitting method , the application of the @xmath0 expansion method gave useful results , as a first approximation .",
    "they predicted the behaviour of the coefficients @xmath20 in the mass formula as a function of the excitation energy .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "this figure suggests that the spin - orbit and the spin - spin terms vanish with the excitation energy , bringing a strong support to constituent quark models and that the spin - spin term is dominant among all the other spin dependent terms .",
    "note that in a quark model picture , the coefficient @xmath67 would correspond to the additional contribution of a free mass term , the kinetic energy and the confinement .",
    "it is not thus surprising that it raises with the excitation energy .",
    "the @xmath0 expansion method provides a powerful theoretical tool to analyze the spin - flavour symmetry of baryons and explains the succes of models based on spin - flavor symmetry .",
