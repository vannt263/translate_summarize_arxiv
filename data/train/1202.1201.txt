    "_ human migration _ , i.e. the movement of large numbers of people out of , or into specific geographical areas ,",
    "is seen as one of the biggest challenges that face the human societies in the 21st century .",
    "on one hand , part of the human population has reasons to _ emigrate _ into countries which provide a `` better '' life  on the other hand , industrialized countries can not sustain their current situation without the _ immigration _ of people .",
    "the real problem arises because the `` demand '' and the `` supply '' side can not be matched .",
    "industrialized countries fear that immigrants do not contribute to their further economic growth but , on the contrary , deplete their wealth by taking advantage of a social security , health , and educational system which they did not contribute to .",
    "if we move this problem on the more abstract level of a game - theoretical model , we can distinguish between two types of agents : those _ cooperating _ , i.e. being able to integrate in a society and to contribute to a common good , namely economic growth , and those _ defecting _",
    ", i.e. without the ability to socially integrate and thus depleting a common good at the cost of the cooperating agents . certainly , based on their past experience , agents can adapt , i.e. they can change their strategy from defection to cooperation and vice versa dependent on the payoff they receive in a given environment .",
    "the question for an industrialized country would be then to define an optimal immigration rate that ( a ) does not destroy the common good , and ( b ) allows agents to adapt to the assumed cooperative environment within one or two generations , even if they may have not immigrated with a cooperative strategy .",
    "the problems of cooperation and defection and the payoff - dependent adoption of strategies have been discussed in the framework of the prisoner s dilemma ( pd ) and the iterated pd ( ipd ) game ( see sect . [ 2 ] ) . with our paper , we add to this framework the ability to migrate between different countries ( `` islands '' ) .",
    "our aim is to reveal optimal conditions for the migration of agents such that cooperating strategies can take over even on those islands where they were initially not present .",
    "we note that migration was previously studied in a game - theoretical context by different authors @xcite .",
    "our work differs from these attemts in various respects .",
    "first of all , we do not assume that migration is based on the anticipated success @xcite  this shifts the conceptual problem of the `` outbreak of cooperation '' to proposing rules with non - local information such that two cooperators meet at the same place , from which cooperating clusters can grow .",
    "we also do not make migration dependent on local variables such as the number of defectors in the neighborhood @xcite or random choices of `` empty '' places @xcite .",
    "in fact , human migration is rarely targeted at less densely crowded places , it is rather the opposite .",
    "further , we do not assume one - shot games such as the pd , but instead consider the ipd in which the number @xmath0 of repeated interaction as well as the mix of up to 8 different strategies plays a crucial role .",
    "eventually , we do not use an agent - based model in which update and migration rules are freely defined , to study their impact on computer simulations on a lattice .",
    "our approach proposes a population based model in which subpopulations are defined with respect to ( a ) their interaction strategy , and ( b ) their spatial location .",
    "the consideration of separated `` islands '' allows a coarse - grained implementation of spatial structures which is in between a lattice or network approach and a meanfield description .",
    "it is known that spatial structures have an impact on the outbreak of cooperation @xcite , but their influence varies with other degrees of freedom , such as update rules , synchronization , interaction topology , payoff matrix .",
    "therefore , in this paper we adopt mostly standard assumptions about the interaction type ( ipd with @xmath0 encounters ) and interaction topology ( panmictic subpopulations ) , strategy adoption ( replication proportional to payoff ) , and migration ( fixed fraction of the population ) . to understand the basic dynamics , we first investigate `` isolated '' islands ( no migration ) to find out about the conditions for the `` outbreak of cooperation '' without external influence .",
    "this `` outbreak '' is defined as the critical point ( strategy mix , number of encounters @xmath0 ) beyond which a whole island is going to be occupied by cooperating agents , if agents adopt strategies proportional to their average payoff .",
    "then , we add migration between islands to this dynamics to find out under which conditions the outbreak of cooperation can be enhanced .",
    "it is important to note that migration does not distinguish between strategies or islands , i.e. there are no better suited strategies for immigration , or bad places with high emigration rates  which we consider as artificial assumptions to explain the `` outbreak of cooperation '' .    to determine the robustness of our findings",
    ", we always consider worst case scenarios , i.e. initial settings in which most islands have either an entirely defective subpopulation , or at least a defective majority .",
    "we further control for important parameters such as the pool of available strategies @xmath2 , the number of interactions @xmath0 or the number of islands @xmath1 , for which critical conditions are derived .",
    "our finding that migration is indeed able to boost the outbreak of cooperation is remarkable both because it is based on minimal assumptions about the dynamics and because it follows from a quite systematic investigation of the underlying conditions .",
    "let us investigate a population of @xmath3 agents divided into subpopulations on @xmath1 different islands which imply a coarse - grained spatial structure , i.e. @xmath4 . agents at island @xmath5 are assumed to interact with the @xmath6 other agents on their island ( _ panmictic population _ ) .",
    "but , in general we assume that migration between the islands is possible , with the respective migration rates given by @xmath7 .",
    "these define the fraction of the agent population at island @xmath8 that migrates to island @xmath9 in a given time interval .",
    "figure [ fig : lattice ] shows the case of 3 different locations .",
    "( with different strategies ) are spatially distributed on @xmath5 islands from where they can migrate at rates @xmath7.,width=226 ]    our model basically considers two different time scales for interaction and migration . we define a _ generation _ @xmath10 to be the time in which each agent has interacted with all other @xmath6 agents a given number of times , denotes as @xmath0 .",
    "thus the total number of interactions during each generation in the panmictic population is roughly @xmath11 . at",
    "any given time , agent @xmath12 can interact only with one other agent in a `` two - person game '' .",
    "but during one generation @xmath10 , it interacts with all other @xmath6 agents @xmath0 times ( repeated two - person game ) .    for the interaction ,",
    "we adopt the well known _",
    "iterative prisoner s dilemma _ ( ipd ) from game theory . at each encounter between agents @xmath12 and @xmath13 , both have two actions to choose from , either to _ collaborate _ ( @xmath14 ) or to _ defect _ ( @xmath15 ) , _ without knowing _ the action chosen by their counterpart .",
    "the outcome of that interaction is described in the following payoff matrix : @xmath16{ccc }      & \\textbf{c } & \\textbf{d}\\\\      \\textbf{c } & \\;(r , r)\\ ; & \\;(s , t)\\ ; \\\\",
    "\\textbf{d } & \\;(t , s)\\ ; & \\;(p , p)\\ ;    \\end{array}\\ ] ] if both agents have chosen to collaborate , then they both receive the payoff @xmath17 .",
    "if one of the agents chose to defect and the other one to cooperate , then the defecting agent receives the payoff @xmath18 and the cooperating the payoff @xmath19 .",
    "if both defect , they both receive the payoff @xmath20 . in the special class of _ prisoner s dilemma _ ( pd ) games , the payoffs have to fullfil the following two inequations : @xmath21 which are met by the standard values @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "this means in a cooperating environment , a defector will get the highest payoff .    for @xmath26 ( `` one - shot '' game ) choosing action",
    "@xmath15 is unbeatable , because it rewards the higher payoff for agent @xmath12 no matter if the opponent chooses @xmath14 or @xmath15 . at the same time ,",
    "the payoff for _ both agents @xmath12 and @xmath13 _ is maximized when both cooperate .",
    "a simple analysis shows that defection is a so - called _ evolutionary stable strategy _ ( ess ) in a one - shot pd .",
    "if the number of cooperators and defectors in the population is given by @xmath27 and @xmath28 respectively , then the expected average payoff for cooperators will be @xmath29 .",
    "similarly the expected average payoff for defectors will be @xmath30 .",
    "since @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 is always larger than @xmath34 for a given number @xmath27 , and pure defection would be optimal in a one - shot game .",
    "even one defector is sufficient to invade the complete population of @xmath35 cooperators .",
    "but in a _ consecutive _ game with short _ memory _ , both agents , by simply choosing @xmath15 , would end up earning less than they would earn by cooperating .",
    "thus , the number of games @xmath0 two agents play together becomes important .",
    "this makes sense only if the agents can remember the previous choices of their opponents , i.e. if they have a memory of @xmath36 steps .",
    "then , for the _ iterated prisoner s dilemma _ ( ipd ) , they are able to develop different _ strategies _ based on their past experiences with their opponents .",
    "we note that the ipd game was studied both in the context of a panmictic population ( ) and assuming a spatial population structure @xcite .    usually , in an ipd only a _ one - step _ memory is taken into accout . based on the known previous choice of its opponent",
    ", either @xmath14 or @xmath15 , agent @xmath12 has then the choice between _ eight _ different strategies . following a notation introduced in @xcite ,",
    "these strategies are coded in a 3-bit binary string @xmath37 $ ] which always refers to _ cooperation_. the first bit represents the _ initial _ choice of agent @xmath12 : it is @xmath38 if agent @xmath12 has _ cooperated _ , and @xmath39 if it has defected initially .",
    "the two other values refer always to the previous choice of agent @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath40 is set to @xmath38 if agent @xmath12 chooses to cooperate given that agent @xmath13 has cooperated before and @xmath39 otherwise .",
    "@xmath41 is similarily set to @xmath38 if agent @xmath12 chooses to cooperate given that agent @xmath13 has defected before and @xmath39 otherwise .",
    "both @xmath40 and @xmath41 can be also interpreted as _ probabilities _ to choose the respective action given the knowledge of the previous choice of the opponent , i.e. @xmath42 in the stochastic case . in the _ deterministic _ case considered in this paper ,",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath40 are either 0 or 1 . out of the eight possible strategies , to keep our results in a tractable manner",
    ", we consider the following four strategies @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) : @xmath45{rrrcl }      z^{(1 ) } : & & [ 1|10 ] & & \\mathrm{tft }",
    "\\\\      z^{(2 ) } : & \\quad & [ 0|00 ] & \\quad & \\mathrm{all - d } \\\\      z^{(3 ) } : & & [ 1|11 ] &   & \\mathrm{all - c } \\\\",
    "z^{(4 ) } : & & [ 0|01 ] & & \\mathrm{a - tft }     \\end{array}\\ ] ] these four strategies were also considered originaly in the famous paper by axelrod & hamilton @xcite .",
    "hence , we will extend these investigations by later adding migration to the game .",
    "we note that all eight strategies have been discussed in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we have dropped those variants that differ only in the first move but then continue as described in the following .",
    "the strategies all - d and all - c are obvious : for @xmath46 agent @xmath12 always chooses to defect regardless of the previous choices of agent @xmath13 , @xmath47 follows likewise .",
    "these two strategies represent the limit case of _ no memory _ , i.e. agent @xmath12 is simply `` fixed '' as a cooperator or a defector .",
    "the most interesting strategy @xmath48 , known as `` tit for tat '' ( tft ) , means that agent @xmath12 initially cooperates and continues to do so , given that agent @xmath13 was also cooperative in the previous move .",
    "however if agent @xmath13 was defective in the previous move , agent @xmath12 chooses to be defective , too .",
    "this strategy was shown to be the most successful one in iterated prisoners dilemmas @xcite .",
    "if initially two cooperative agents meet , they stay cooperative ( forever , in a deterministic game ) , this way maximizing their average payoff .",
    "this encourages other agents to adopt tft .",
    "hence , the `` outbreak of cooperation '' in a community of @xmath3 agents occurs as the amplification of a cooperative initial fluctuation .",
    "the fourth possible strategy @xmath49 is just the negation of the most successful one , therefore named anti - tft .",
    "it means that agent @xmath12 starts as a defector and continues to be so , as long as it meets with cooperative agents @xmath13 , this way receiving the highest possible payoff @xmath18 .",
    "but , if it meets an agent that has previously defected , it changes its `` behavior '' to cooperation .",
    "this makes some sense , since the loss in payoff is not that much ",
    "@xmath20 would be just slightly higher than @xmath19 . on the other hand , if the colloborative agent meets again with another cooperative agent , the payoff would be @xmath17 , which is a much higher gain .",
    "so , this strategy , while not making sense in the first place , may end up with a higher payoff in those cases where defecting and cooperating strategies are equally present .",
    "we will later show that a - tft in the long run benefits agents playing all - d and therefore will create a more difficult environment for the invasion of cooperation .",
    "i.e. considering all four strategies captures a worst - case scenario for the outbreak of cooperation which we deem interesting to study ( instead of giving rational arguments in favor of a - tft ) .      in this paper , we are interested in how the frequencies of the different strategies would evolve in the agent community .",
    "the fraction of agents choosing strategy @xmath43 on island @xmath5 is defined as @xmath50 , where the different strategies are given by eq .",
    "( [ strat ] ) .",
    "similarly , the _ total fraction _ of agents playing strategy @xmath43 in the _ whole _ system , is given as @xmath51 .",
    "for the dynamics we may assume that during each generation @xmath10 every agent behaves according to a fixed strategy picked up from the pool of possible strategies .",
    "this strategy can be changed only after one generation is completed .",
    "the `` update '' rule for the strategy is simply given by the success of different strategies during the past generation . as the evaluation criteria , we choose the average payoff @xmath52 , each strategy has received during the last generation on island @xmath5 .",
    "this will be compared with the total average payoff @xmath53 that gives an estimate of the overall dynamics on that island : @xmath54 for the evolution of the frequencies of the different strategies , the following dynamics is postulated : @xmath55 it means that in the next generation @xmath56 the share of agents choosing a particular strategy @xmath43 has grown / shrunk  i.e. , strategy @xmath43 has replicated  according to the _ relative _ performance of this strategy on island @xmath5 during the previous generation @xmath10 . in population dynamics , this is known as _ fitness - proportional selection _",
    "@xcite , we adopt it here since the relative performance of a certain strategy can be also interpreted as its _",
    "fitness_.    the dynamics of eq .",
    "( [ a - dyn ] ) does not take into account that agents can migrate between the @xmath1 islands . for simplicity , we assume that each island @xmath5 is occupied by the same number of agents @xmath57 and migration can occur between between any two islands with a constant and equal migration rate @xmath58 .",
    "we interpret @xmath59 as the total fraction of the agent population at any given island that migrates to other islands in a given time interval , namely one generation . in a first approximation",

    "after _ a generation is completed , i.e. at fixed times @xmath10 , @xmath56 .",
    "while the fraction @xmath60 is fixed ( but controlled for , afterwards ) , the _ composition _ of the migrating subpopulation across the existing strategies @xmath43 is not .",
    "we assume this composition to be proportional to the fraction @xmath61 of these strategies at island @xmath5 at the time when generation @xmath10 is completed and migration occurs , to affect the dynamics during the next time interval @xmath56 .",

    "this would lead to a correction term of the order of @xmath90 , which is small and therefore neglected here .      with the above specifications we are now able to solve the dynamic equations with respect to the fraction of agents @xmath91 playing strategy @xmath43 . here , we are mostly interested in the impact of migration on the prevailence of certain strategies , therefore we will discuss first the case _ without _ migration , eq .",

    "plotting @xmath199 we see that for @xmath200 , with every new island added the _ relative effort _ to invade the new one with cooperators _ decreases _ , while for @xmath201 this effort _ increases _ quadratically with @xmath1",

[",
    "fig : howto_find_threshold](middle )    eventually , one can ask how the outbreak of cooperation @xmath204 is affected if instead of the two strategies tft , all - d three or four strategies are considered . in general , the presence of both all - c and a - tft favors the invasion of all - d at the end , whereas the presence of a - tft favors the invasion of tft  thus we can expect that the thresholds are slightly higher or lower in such cases . a more involved discussion is presented in [ divers ] .",
    "before summarizing our findings , we wish to comment on a related strand of literature about multi - level selection in populations @xcite . there , quite similar to the setup presented in our paper , a population consisting of several groups ( subpopulations ) was considered where interaction only occurs between agents of the same subpopulation .",
    "the fitness of agents was determined by the payoff obtained from an evolutionary game , simply chosen as a non - iterative prisoner s dilemma , and their reproduction was assumed to be dependent on their payoff according to a moran process @xcite .",
    "further a stochastic dynamics was considered .",
    "in addition to these differences ( pd , moran process , stochastic dynamics ) , also a separate group dynamics was assumed .",
    "groups can split when reaching a certain size , which denotes a amplified replication process at the group level .",
    "precisely , groups that contain fitter agents reach the critical size faster and , therefore , split more often .",
    "this concept leads to selection among groups , although only individuals reproduce .",
    "it allows for the emergence of higher level selection ( group ) from lower level reproduction ( agents ) .",
    "it was shown @xcite that cooperation in such a setting is favored if the size of groups is small whereas the number of groups is large .",
    "migration does _ not _ support the outbreak of cooperation in this model because it favors the invasion of defectors rather than of cooperators .",
    "in contrast to these investigations , we have contributed to the analysis of evolutionary ( deterministic ) ipd games in two different domains :    * for the meanfield limit , represented by a panmictic population where each agent interacts with @xmath35 other agents @xmath0 times , a quantitative investigation of the basins of attraction was provided .",
    "dependent on the initial mix of two cooperative ( all - c , tft ) and two defective ( all - d , a - tft ) strategies and the number of interactions @xmath0 , we could derive the critical conditions ( threshold frequencies ) under which the outbreak of cooperation can be expected in a panmictic population . a detailed analysis of the two , three and four strategy cases helped to better understand the contribution of each strategy on the final outcome . * using the `` unpertubed '' ( or meanfield ) limit as a reference point",
    ", the impact of migration on the outbreak of cooperation in a spatially distributed system could be quantified .",
    "we found that there is a bandwidth of optimal migration rates which lead to the induction ( or `` export '' ) of cooperation to a number of islands which otherwise would converge to defection .",
    "we were able to determine the critical conditions @xmath205 which guarantee the outbreak of cooperation in a worst case scenario .",
    "remarkably , the relative effort @xmath206 to export cooperation to defecting islands was decreasing with @xmath1 in some range and always stayed below the critical value for an isolated island .",
    "i.e. effectively it became easier to turn defecting into cooperating islands , provided the optimal migration rate was reached .",
    "it is important to note that the outbreak of cooperation is not enforced by a maximal migration rate but , as stated above , by a small range of optimal migration rates .",
    "this is because migration , different from other approaches , is not seen as an unidirectional dynamics , where agents just move to a `` better '' place . instead",
    ", our model is based on the assumption that it is a _ bidirectional",
    "_ process , which we deem a more realistic assumptions when considering a dynamics over many generations .",
    "in fact , agents , or their offsprings , which have obtained certain skills or wealth at their immigration country , quite often decide to start new buisness back home at their origin country  because their new capabilities give them a considerable advantage there , while it is only a marginal advantage in their immigration country .",
    "this assumption is in line with many policies about immigration / education of foreigners in a country , to give indirect support for development and to allow future business with those countries , where some agents with positive experience have resettled . at the end , as we have shown in our paper , it remarkably helps to spread `` cooperation '' globally , if the number of breeding places for such a strategy is increased ( above a minimum threshold ) .",
