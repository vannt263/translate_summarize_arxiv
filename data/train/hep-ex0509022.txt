    "the babar detector@xcite is located at the @xmath1 asymmetric b - factory at slac .",
    "the main physics goal of babar is to study cp - violation in the @xmath2 system and provide a quantitative test of the @xmath3 sector of the standard model .",
    "the determination of the angle @xmath0 through the study of  decays plays a key role in this test .",
    "the measurement of @xmath0 from decays mediated by @xmath4 tree level diagrams allows for a precise test of cp violation in the standard model and provides the most precise constraint in the determination of the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , the measurement of the same angle in final states mediated by penguin decays and @xmath7 diagrams can be used to look for new physics .",
    "all measurements presented in this article are based on a dataset of @xmath8   events .",
    "at the @xmath2-factories , @xmath3 violation is studied through the measurement of the time dependent @xmath3 asymmetry , @xmath9 .",
    "this quantity is defined as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the number of  that decay into the @xmath3-eigenstate @xmath12 after a time @xmath13 .",
    "in general , this asymmetry can be expressed as the sum of two components : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the difference in mass between @xmath2 mass eigenstates .",
    "when only one diagram contributes to the final state , the cosine term vanishes . for decays such as @xmath16 , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the @xmath3 eigenvalue of the final state , negative for charmonium + @xmath19 and positive for charmonium + @xmath20 .",
    "it follows that @xmath21 which shows how the angle @xmath0 is directly and simply measured by the amplitude of the time dependent @xmath3 asymmetry .",
    "the measurement of @xmath9 utilizes decays of the @xmath22 into two neutral @xmath2 mesons , of which one ( @xmath23 ) can be completely reconstructed into a @xmath3 eigenstate , while the decay products of the other ( @xmath24 ) identify its flavor at decay time .",
    "the time @xmath13 between the two @xmath2 decays is determined by reconstructing the two @xmath2 decay vertexes .",
    "the @xmath3 asymmetry amplitudes are determined from an unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the time distributions separately for events tagged as  and .",
    "the angle @xmath0 can be independently measured through the three types of  decays illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fey ] and discussed in the following .",
    "these decays , known as `` golden modes '' , are dominated by a tree level diagram @xmath4 with internal @xmath26 boson emission ( fig . [ fey]-a ) . the leading penguin diagram contribution to the final state",
    "has the same weak phase as the tree diagram , and the largest term with different weak phase is a penguin diagram contribution suppressed by @xmath27 .",
    "this makes @xmath28 in equation  [ acpt2 ] a very good approximation .",
    "besides the theoretical simplicity , these modes also offer experimental advantages because of their relatively large branching fractions ( @xmath29 ) and the presence of the narrow @xmath30 resonance in the final state , which provides a powerful rejection of combinatorial background .",
    "the @xmath3 eigenstates considered for this analysis are @xmath31 , @xmath32(2s)@xmath19 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the asymmetry between the two  distributions , clearly visible in figure [ babarsin2b-2 ] , is a striking manifestation of @xmath3 violation in the @xmath2 system .",
    "the same figures also display the corresponding raw @xmath3 asymmetry with the projection of the unbinned maximum likelihood fit superimposed .",
    "the results of the fit is @xmath36@xcite .",
    "the main sources of systematic errors are uncertainties in the background level and characteristics , in the parameterization of the time resolution , and in the measurement of the mis - tag fractions .",
    "most of these uncertainties will decrease with additional statistics .",
    "[ babarsin2b-2 ]    the world average value for @xmath37 , heavily dominated by the results from babar@xcite and belle@xcite , is @xmath38 .",
    "this value can be compared with the indirect constraints on the apex of the unitarity triangle originating from measurements of @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 ,  and @xmath42 mixing as described , for example , in reference  @xcite .",
    "the comparison , illustrated in figure [ ckmfitter1 ] , shows excellent agreement between the measurements , indicating that the observed @xmath3 asymmetry in @xmath25 is consistent with the predictions of the ckm mechanism .",
    "the measurement of @xmath43 leads to a four - fold ambiguity in the determination of the angle @xmath0 .",
    "this ambiguity can be reduced to a two - fold ambiguity measuring the sign of @xmath44 , which can be measured in a time - dependent angular analysis of the decays @xmath45(@xmath46 ) .",
    "an analysis  @xcite based on 81.9 fb@xmath47 measures @xmath48 , which determines the sign of @xmath49 to be positive at the 86.6% c.l . , in agreement with the standard model expectation .",
    "the decays @xmath50 are dominated by a tree level diagram @xmath7 with external @xmath26 boson emission ( fig . [ fey]-b ) . in the standard model , the leading penguin diagram contribution to this final state",
    "is expected to be small .",
    "the penguin - induced correction has been estimated using factorization and heavy quark symmetry to be about 2%  @xcite .",
    "new physics could enhance the penguin contribution and would lead to a measurement of time dependent @xmath3 asymmetry substantially different from that measured in @xmath25 decays .",
    "babar measures @xmath9 in three different channels : @xmath51@xcite , @xmath52 and @xmath53@xcite .",
    "since two different diagrams can contribute to the final state in these decays , both the sine ( @xmath54 ) and cosine ( @xmath55 ) terms have to be extracted in the fit for @xmath9 .",
    "the extraction of the coefficients s and c is straightforward for the channel @xmath56 , which is a pure cp eigenstate .",
    "instead , the decay @xmath57 is an admixture of cp - odd and cp - even components .",
    "the cp - odd fraction is measured by means of a transversity analysis@xcite to be @xmath58 .",
    "the results of the cp fit for @xmath2 decays to open charm reported in table [ tabdd ] are in agreement with the standard model expectations .",
    ".measurements of the sine ( s ) and cosine ( c ) coefficient in the fit of @xmath9 in @xmath7 decays . [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      +      in the standard model , final states dominated by @xmath60 or @xmath61 decays offer a clean and independent way of measuring @xmath62@xcite .",
    "examples of these final states are @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "these decays are mediated by the gluonic penguin diagram illustrated in figure [ fey]-c . in presence of physics beyond the standard model , new particles such as squarks and gluinos , could participate in the loop and affect the time dependent asymmetries@xcite .",
    "the decays @xmath70 are ideal for these studies . in the standard model ,",
    "these decays are almost pure @xmath60 penguin decays , and their cp asymmetry is expected to coincide with the one measured in charmonium + k@xmath71 decays within a few percent  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , this channel is also very clean , thanks to the powerful background suppression due to the narrow @xmath72 resonance .",
    "unfortunately , the branching fraction for this mode is quite small ( @xmath73 ) , therefore the measurement is affected by a large statistical error .",
    "the decays @xmath74 are favored by a larger branching fraction ( @xmath75 ) . in the standard model ,",
    "these decays are also dominated by penguin diagrams ; other contributions are expected to be small  @xcite .",
    "a summary of the measurements of @xmath9 in penguin modes  @xcite by the babar experiment is reported in figure [ figurepenguin ] .",
    "the average of all the penguin modes  @xcite , shown in yellow in figure [ figurepenguin ] , is 2.8@xmath76 away from the value of @xmath37 measured in the golden mode .",
    "this discrepancy , however , has to be interpreted with caution since each mode is theoretically affected by new physics in different ways .",
    "the measurement of time - dependent cp asymmetry in  decays have provided a crucial test of @xmath3 violation in the standard model .",
    "the parameter @xmath37 is now measured in @xmath4 decays by babar with a precision of 5% .",
    "measurements of time - dependent @xmath3 violation asymmetries in @xmath7 and in penguin - dominated modes are sensitive to contributions from physics beyond the standard model .",
    "these measurements are still heavily dominated by statistical errors and will benefit greatly from additional data .",
    "babar is planning to double its dataset by 2006 and quadruple it by 2008 .",
