    "the notions of ` free probability ' and ` freeness ' of non - commutative random variables were introduced by voiculescu in the study of certain algebras of bounded operators @xcite .",
    "the word freeness in this context means a kind of statistical independence of operators .",
    "the algebraic concept of freeness of random variables has a natural realization by random matrices in the limit of infinite matrix dimension @xcite ; this realization is what we study , develop , and apply in the present paper .",
    "a central tool of the free probability formalism is the so - called @xmath5-transform , which resembles the logarithm of the characteristic function for commutative random variables .",
    "voiculescu @xcite defined it by the functional inverse of the average trace of the resolvent operator . a second approach to the subject",
    "is due to speicher @xcite , who expressed the moments of the random matrix directly in terms of the taylor coefficients of the @xmath5-transform .",
    "speicher s concept of non - crossing partition is a mathematical expression of the dominance of planar feynman graphs ( using physics parlance ) in the large-@xmath3 limit . in the present paper",
    "we will encounter both approaches : the analytical one of voiculescu , and the combinatorial one of speicher .",
    "our long - term goal is a comprehensive description of the spectral correlation functions and , ultimately , a proof of the universality hypothesis which is expected for certain random matrix ensembles in the large-@xmath3 limit .",
    "although the @xmath5-transform is a powerful tool to tackle density - of - states questions , it is fair to say that free probability theory has not yet contributed much to our understanding of the universality of spectral correlation functions at the scale of the level spacing .    bearing this in mind",
    ", we now change subject and turn to the so - called supersymmetry method , by which we mean the technique of integration over commuting and anti - commuting variables pioneered by wegner @xcite and efetov @xcite . in its original formulation",
    "( using the hubbard - stratonovich transformation ) this method was limited to gaussian disorder distributions .",
    "nonetheless , with this limitation it has enjoyed great success in producing non - trivial results for a number of physics problems , e.g. , level statistics of small metallic grains , localization in thick disordered wires , scaling exponents at the anderson transition , etc . in the present paper",
    "we will take advantage of a recent variant , called superbosonization , which makes it possible in principle to treat a class of disorder distributions much wider than the gaussian one .",
    "since their inception in the 1980 s , free probability theory and the supersymmetry method have coexisted with little or no mutual interaction .",
    "forecast in a prescient remark by p.  zinn - justin @xcite , the message of the present paper is that a new quality emerges when the two formalisms are combined .",
    "more specifically , we will show that the characteristic function of the probability law of the random matrix ensemble  an object of central importance to superbosonization  has a large-@xmath3 limit which is determined by the @xmath5-transform .",
    "this result paves the way for a number of applications . as a first application",
    ", we will illustrate the new method by demonstrating universality for a random matrix model of stochastic scattering .",
    "our results make reference to the @xmath5-transform , which we now introduce in more detail .",
    "consider the average trace of the resolvent operator , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , of the random matrix @xmath8 .",
    "voiculescu inverts the function @xmath9 to define the @xmath5-transform as the regular part of @xmath10 .",
    "it has a power series @xmath11 whose coefficients @xmath12 are called free cumulants .",
    "these are analogs ( in the non - commutative setting ) of the usual cumulants in that they are linear with respect to free convolution .    in the present paper",
    ", we consider @xmath13-invariant probability measures @xmath14 with a density of the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes lebesgue measure on the linear space of hermitian @xmath0 matrices , and @xmath17 is analytic and uniformly convex .",
    "the focus of our analysis is the characteristic function @xmath18 note that @xmath19 is invariant under conjugation @xmath20 by @xmath21 .    motivated by the supersymmetry method as reviewed in section [ sect : motiv ] , we make a study of @xmath22 for linear operators @xmath4 of the form @xmath23 with @xmath24 kept fixed in the limit @xmath25 . here",
    "@xmath26 are vectors , while @xmath27 are co - vectors .",
    "the components of @xmath28 are complex commuting variables or generators of the symmetric algebra @xmath29 , whereas the components of @xmath30 are complex anti - commuting variables or generators of the exterior algebra @xmath31 .",
    "the same statement , albeit with @xmath32 replaced by @xmath33 , applies to @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively .",
    "all inner products @xmath36 for @xmath37 are kept fixed in the large-@xmath3 limit .    for such @xmath4",
    "we argue that the following holds : @xmath38 we note that this formula makes perfect sense as long as the power series of the @xmath5-transform has infinite radius of convergence .",
    "the latter property is ensured by our assumptions on @xmath2 .      to put the result ( [ eq : result - mz ] ) into context , we now mention related mathematical work on the large-@xmath3 asymptotics of the following spherical integral ( known in the physics literature as the itzykson - zuber integral ) : @xmath39 for the case of a rank - one projector @xmath40 .",
    "let the eigenvalues @xmath41 of the hermitian matrices @xmath42 be confined to a _",
    "interval @xmath43 $ ] and assume that the empirical measure @xmath44 converges weakly to a measure with support in @xmath43 $ ] . under these conditions",
    "the following is known .",
    "collins @xcite differentiates the scaled logarithm of the spherical integral @xmath45 times at zero to show that @xmath46 i.e. , he establishes convergence to the @xmath47 free cumulant ( times a factorial ) . a stronger version of this result , @xmath48 was proved by guionnet and maida @xcite under the condition that @xmath49 is small enough .",
    "( notice that ( [ eq : g - m ] ) implies ( [ eq : collins ] ) . ) for @xmath50 real and large , however , the authors of @xcite obtain a _",
    "behavior , separated from the small-@xmath50 regime by a phase transition .",
    "these results have a bearing on ( [ eq : result - mz ] ) for @xmath51 , @xmath52 because the integral ( [ eq : char - func ] ) can be done in two steps : fixing some set of eigenvalues for @xmath8 we first do the integral over @xmath13 orbits  that s precisely the spherical integral ( [ eq : hciz ] )  and afterwards we take the average over the fluctuating eigenvalues .",
    "while it may seem puzzling at first sight that the authors of @xcite find a phase transition whereas we do not , section [ sect : match ] explains that there is no contradiction here .",
    "the assumption of eigenvalues strictly confined to an interval @xmath43 $ ] would mean in our context that the confining potential @xmath53 is infinitely high outside of @xmath43 $ ] .",
    "in contradistinction , we assume that @xmath2 is both uniformly convex and analytic . in the latter setting the existence of a phase transition is ruled out on physical and mathematical grounds .",
    "we in fact argue that the limit in ( [ eq : g - m ] ) is an entire function of @xmath54 .      by the general principles of invariant theory , the characteristic function @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) lifts to a function @xmath57 of the supermatrix of @xmath58-invariants @xmath59 the angular brackets still mean contraction of the vector with the co - vector . by the relation @xmath60 ( where @xmath61 denotes the supertrace )",
    "it follows from ( [ eq : result - mz ] ) that @xmath62 the lifted function @xmath63 is input required by the superbosonization method ( section [ sect : motiv ] ) ; in the past this input was the link missing for applications . with ( [ eq : result - mz2 ] ) established , we now have at our disposal a powerful new method for the treatment of random matrix problems . in the present paper",
    "we illustrate the new method by demonstrating universality for a random matrix model of stochastic scattering .",
    "in particular , we point out that the pertinent large-@xmath3 saddle - point equation for @xmath64 is voiculescu s equation @xmath65 generalized to the ( super-)matrix case : @xmath66    while the present paper addresses only the case of unitary symmetry , our treatment is robust and readily extends to ensembles with orthogonal or symplectic symmetry .",
    "an outline of the contents of the paper is as follows .",
    "section [ sect : motiv ] provides background and motivation by introducing the characteristic function @xmath19 as a key object of the supersymmetry method .",
    "for the special case of @xmath67 with @xmath68 and a rank - one projector @xmath40 , the large-@xmath3 asymptotics of @xmath22 is computed in section [ sect : dyson ] using dyson coulomb gas methods .",
    "particular attention is paid to the fact that the asymptotics for small and large @xmath50 match perfectly to give an answer which is smooth as a function of @xmath50 .",
    "the fermionic analog @xmath69 with anti - commuting @xmath70 is treated by drawing on information from representation theory in section [ sect : ff ] . by using standard perturbation theory in the large-@xmath3 limit",
    "we then develop in section [ sect : combinatorics ] a combinatorial description of the full superfunction @xmath22 .",
    "the resulting formalism is applied to a model of stochastic scattering in section [ sect : scattering ] .",
    "an outlook is given in section [ sect : last ] .",
    "we begin the paper with a concise review of the supersymmetry method and , in particular , of superbosonization . in this way , we shall introduce and motivate the fourier transform @xmath71 with @xmath4 given by ( [ eq : def - k ] ) , which is a superfunction with symmetries and the key object to be analyzed in the sequel .",
    "consider the hermitian vector space @xmath32 with its standard hermitian scalar product @xmath72 , which determines a @xmath73-antilinear bijection @xmath74 between @xmath32 and its dual vector space @xmath75 .",
    "following standard physics conventions , we denote by the same symbol ( dagger ) the operation @xmath76 of taking the hermitian conjugate of a linear operator @xmath77 .    in the following the hamiltonian @xmath8",
    "will always be a random hermitian operator : @xmath78 distributed according to some probability measure @xmath79 .",
    "our goal is to study the spectral correlation functions which are defined as averages with respect to @xmath79 . for this purpose",
    "we consider the characteristic polynomial @xmath80 associated with @xmath8 .",
    "the supersymmetry method allows us to compute expectations of products of ratios of such polynomials , and hence of products of resolvent traces @xmath81 , as follows .",
    "let us denote the canonical pairing @xmath82 ( i.e. , evaluation of a linear form @xmath83 on a vector @xmath84 ) by @xmath85 with the resolvent operator @xmath86 for @xmath87 we associate a holomorphic function @xmath88 by @xmath89 now let @xmath90 be the graph of the @xmath91-linear mapping @xmath92 thus @xmath93 is the real vector space of all pairs @xmath94 for @xmath95 .",
    "the gaussian @xmath96 decreases rapidly along @xmath97 . indeed , @xmath98",
    "so we may integrate @xmath96 along @xmath97 . by a standard formula for gaussian integrals",
    "we have @xmath99 where the integral is over @xmath93 with ( @xmath100-valued ) lebesgue measure normalized by the condition @xmath101 .",
    "( this measure is not made explicit in our notation . )    expressing @xmath102 as a logarithmic derivative , @xmath103 we see that we need a gaussian integration formula for @xmath104 ( where @xmath105 ) in addition to that for reciprocals @xmath106 . such a formula can be had by replacing commuting variables @xmath107 by anticommuting variables @xmath108 ; i.e. , we view @xmath109 as a quadratic element of the exterior algebra generated by the direct sum @xmath110 . the precise meaning is this .",
    "let @xmath111 be a basis of @xmath32 and @xmath112 be the dual basis of @xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath113 be the canonical embedding ; or simply put , view @xmath114 and @xmath115 as anticommuting variables or generators of the exterior algebras @xmath31 and @xmath116 respectively .",
    "then we define @xmath117 to be the element of @xmath118 given by @xmath119    by exponentiating this expression we get a gaussian element in ( the even part of ) the full exterior algebra : @xmath120 the berezin integral @xmath121 for @xmath122 is , by definition , projection on the one - dimensional subspace @xmath123 of top degree . in the case of our gaussian integrand",
    "the result of this projection is known to be proportional to the determinant of the operator @xmath124 .",
    "we normalize the berezin integral in such a way that the constant of proportionality is unity : @xmath125 to summarize the above , we have two gaussian integration formulas : eq .",
    "( [ eq : det-1 ] ) for the secular determinant @xmath126 , and eq .",
    "( [ eq : det-0 ] ) for its reciprocal .    by multiplying these formulas , averaging the result with the given probability density @xmath127 , and interchanging the order of integrations",
    ", we obtain @xmath128 where @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 is the characteristic function @xmath132 note that the formula ( [ eq : ratio ] ) requires the evaluation of @xmath131 for @xmath133 where @xmath134 and @xmath135 are the linear coordinates associated with the bases @xmath111 of @xmath32 and @xmath136 of @xmath33 .",
    "thus the operator @xmath4 is an endomorphism of @xmath32 with coefficients in the tensor product @xmath137 of the symmetric and exterior algebras of @xmath138 .",
    "it will be important that the numerical part of @xmath139 has finite rank .",
    "the relation ( [ eq : ratio ] ) transfers the integral over @xmath140 random matrices @xmath8 to an integral over the variables @xmath141 constituting the bilinear @xmath4 .",
    "this transfer will be a step forward if we can calculate the function @xmath19 or , at least , gather enough information about it . for the case of a gaussian probability measure @xmath79 ,",
    "the fourier - laplace transform @xmath19 is also gaussian .",
    "the supersymmetry formalism then takes its course and delivers results quickly .",
    "however , using the traditional version of the supersymmetry method one did not know how to proceed in the general case of non - gaussian @xmath79 .",
    "one way to proceed , as we shall now review , is to make a symmetry assumption about @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath142 .",
    "then @xmath143 for @xmath144 is a superfunction @xmath145 , and by making the identifications @xmath146 and @xmath147 we may regard @xmath148 as a holomorphic differential form on the complex vector space @xmath2 .",
    "let now @xmath14 be invariant under conjugation @xmath149 by the elements @xmath150 of some compact group @xmath151 .",
    "then by integrating @xmath152 against @xmath153 we obtain a differential form @xmath154 which is @xmath151-equivariant , i.e. , @xmath155 where @xmath156 and @xmath157 are the natural @xmath151-actions on @xmath2 resp .",
    "later we will write this equivariance property more intuitively as @xmath159 .",
    "in such a setting , the superbosonization method offers a reduction step which is available @xcite for the classical lie groups @xmath160 , @xmath161 , and @xmath162 . for each of these groups ,",
    "the algebra of @xmath151-equivariant differential forms on @xmath2 is generated by ( the dual of ) the @xmath163-graded vector space @xmath164 of quadratic @xmath151-invariants @xcite .",
    "after lifting the differential form @xmath165 to a superfunction @xmath166 , the step of ` superbosonization ' transfers the integral on the r.h.s .  of ( [ eq : ratio ] ) to an integral of the lifted superfunction over a ( low - dimensional ) riemannian symmetric superspace .",
    "we now reproduce from @xcite the details for the case of @xmath167 , with a few notational adjustments to fit the present situation . by immediate generalization of ( [ eq : ratio ] )",
    "we have @xmath168 where the @xmath107-integral is over the real subspace @xmath169 while intending to specialize to the case of @xmath170 later , we here describe the general case @xmath171 for a clear exposition of the formalism .",
    "to simplify the notation , it is convenient to regard the vectors @xmath172 as the components of a linear mapping @xmath107 from @xmath173 to @xmath174 @xmath175 similarly , we view @xmath176 as a linear mapping @xmath177 using the same conventions on the anti - commuting side , we write our integral as @xmath178 here @xmath179 , and @xmath180 , @xmath181 are diagonal operators .",
    "the integral is over @xmath182    it is evident that the integrand on the r.h.s",
    ".  of ( [ eq : int - formula ] ) has the invariance property @xmath183 for @xmath184 and hence , by holomorphic continuation , for @xmath185 .",

    "@xmath204 is simply the product of differentials times the product of derivatives : @xmath206 finally , it should be stressed that the formula ( [ eq : supbos ] ) is valid if and only if @xmath207 .",
    "application of the superbosonization formula ( [ eq : supbos ] ) to eq .",

    "supbos2 ] ) our short - term goals should now be well motivated : the key object to understand is the lifted characteristic ( super-)function @xmath57 .",
    "if we can control @xmath211 , results for the level correlation functions will follow from a large-@xmath3 asymptotic saddle analysis of the @xmath64-integral .",
    "based on what is called the dyson coulomb gas , we are now going to study @xmath19 for the rank - one case @xmath212 with @xmath213 and @xmath40 the projector on a one - dimensional subspace of @xmath32 .",
    "a related situation has been investigated in the work of p.  zinn - justin @xcite , collins @xcite , and guionnet & maida @xcite ; we will comment on the literature as we go along .",

    "let us now assume that @xmath222 has compact support .",
    "then there exists a number @xmath223 such that for @xmath105 with @xmath224 the power series ( [ eq : g(z)-series ] ) converges , the derivative @xmath225 does not vanish , and hence by the implicit function theorem the function @xmath217 has a local inverse . because the expansion of @xmath226 around @xmath227 begins as @xmath228 , the power series for the inverse function will likewise begin as @xmath229 plus corrections .",

    "we thus obtain @xmath322    because the coulomb gas energy is of order @xmath323 , which is large compared to the perturbation due to the contour integral and here in particular the ` external electric field ' term @xmath324 , we expect the density of the fluid of charges @xmath288 to remain the same in the limit @xmath25 .",

    "the integral ( [ eq : int - small - k ] ) for @xmath25 is computable by saddle analysis and the method of steepest descent .",

    "the large-@xmath3 asymptotic analysis of ( [ eq : mrz - x1 ] ) then is rather straightforward ; see below .",
    "on the other hand , as @xmath50 decreases below a critical value the saddle merges with the fluid @xmath43 $ ] , where @xmath376 oscillates rapidly . the integral representation ( [ eq : mrz - x1 ] ) then does not give a direct view of the large-@xmath3 asymptotics .",

    "( for @xmath379 the argument goes just the same . )",
    "the main contribution to the integral ( [ eq : mrz - x1 ] ) then comes from large values of @xmath370 , where the polynomial ( [ eq : mrz - x2 ] ) behaves as @xmath380 by inserting this asymptotic expression into the integral ( [ eq : mrz - x1 ] ) we obtain @xmath381 with another constant @xmath382 .    the condition for @xmath383 to be an extremum of the integrand is @xmath384 from ( [ eq : ana - cont ] ) we know that @xmath385 is the second branch of the double - valued function @xmath386 .",

    "hence , by applying the method of steepest descent and evaluating the integrand of ( [ eq : mrz - x1 ] ) at the critical point @xmath399 we obtain @xmath400 where the second equality is by ( [ eq : mrz - i1 ] ) .",

    "also , in the present setting there is no reason to think that @xmath357 should have any singularities in the complex @xmath50-plane .",
    "hence , by the identity principle ( i.e. , uniqueness of analytic continuation ) we expect that @xmath424 holds for all @xmath49 .",

    "we here assume the exponent of our probability distribution @xmath571 to be of the form @xmath572 where the parameter @xmath573 is small , so that the interaction ( or non - quadratic part ) @xmath574 can be treated as a perturbation . in order to develop a perturbation expansion in the small parameter @xmath573",

    "any given graph contributes with an overall power of @xmath591 where @xmath592 is the euler characteristic of the graph , i.e. , the number of vertices minus the number of edges plus the number of faces .",
    "indeed , every vertex carries a factor of @xmath3 , every edge comes with a factor of @xmath593 , and every face corresponds to a free summation variable , thereby contributing one factor of @xmath3 .",
    "( to do this counting , we first delete the vertex legs that are saturated by the final substitution @xmath594 . )",
    "thus the second term on the r.h.s .  of ( [ eq : pt ] ) can be organized as a sum over topological sectors : @xmath595 where @xmath596 is the sum of all contributions from graphs with euler characteristic @xmath592 .    by the linked cluster theorem ,",
    "disconnected graphs cancel upon taking the logarithm .",
    "now among the set of all connected graphs ( with at least one substitution @xmath594 ) the euler characteristic becomes maximal for planar graphs with the topology of a disk @xmath597 , where all substitutions @xmath594 are arranged around the boundary of @xmath597 .",
    "the euler characteristic for such a graph is @xmath598 ; indeed , a triangle , say , has three vertices , three edges , and one face , so @xmath599 .",
    "the euler characteristic of a non - planar graph is known to be smaller than the planar value @xmath598 .",
    "there also exist planar graphs which have a topology different from that of a disk ; examples are the annulus or a disk with several holes in its interior resulting in an ` inner ' boundary .",

    "the upshot of all this is that the leading contribution to ( [ eq : pt1 ] ) in the large-@xmath3 limit is of order @xmath601 and is given by the sum over all planar graphs with disk topology .",
    "because these graphs are constructed by inserting every substitution @xmath602 into a single line ( circulating around the boundary of the disk - shaped graph ) , they all produce single - trace contributions @xmath603 , @xmath535 .",

    "it should be emphasized at this point that we are taking the limit @xmath325 while keeping the rank of ( the numerical part of ) @xmath4 _ finite_. non - disk ( e.g. , annular ) planar graphs make contributions of the multi - trace form @xmath606 which would not become negligible in the large-@xmath3 limit if we let @xmath607 grow with @xmath3 .",
    "this ends our excursion into perturbation theory .",
    "based on the result ( [ eq : expect ] ) , which should even be valid beyond the domain of validity of perturbation theory ( if only as a series expansion with finite radius of convergence ) , it is straightforward to compute the large-@xmath3 limit of the cumulant tensor ( [ eq : nth - cum ] ) . doing so with the help of ( [ eq : cum - invs ] )",

    "we can not tell whether @xmath12 indeed is the @xmath47 free cumulant , but this open question will be settled in the next subsection . our strategy will be to show that the large-@xmath3 hypothesis ( [ hypothesis ] ) implies speicher s formula ( [ eq : speicher ] ) . since it is already known that the coefficients @xmath12 of the latter formula are the free cumulants , the desired result follows .      just as in the case",

    "each pair @xmath632 of consecutive segments represents one partial derivative @xmath633 , which we graphically depict by the boundary point ( also numbered by @xmath50 ) between the two segments .",
    "these @xmath634 points separating consecutive segments are the 0-cells of @xmath629 .",
    "the partition @xmath519 has not yet been used ; but now , if @xmath506 numbers taken from the set @xmath635 constitute one block of @xmath519 , we draw @xmath508 arcs across @xmath597 to connect the members of that block ( or rather , the numbered @xmath636-cells assigned to them ) with one another .",
    "we take each such arc to be another @xmath637-cell of @xmath629 .",
    "note that the total number of @xmath637-cells of @xmath629 is @xmath638    because the partition @xmath519 is non - crossing , the lines of the @xmath637-cells of @xmath629 divide the area of the disk @xmath597 into sectors .",
    "we take these sectors to be the @xmath628-cells of the complex @xmath629 , and denote their total number by @xmath639 . figure [ fig : bild1 ] shows the result of this construction for the example given above .",

    "next we observe that for each block or cumulant tensor there exists just one large-@xmath3 optimal permutation @xmath654 in the sum of ( [ eq : cum - invs ] )  this is the shift permutation , or translation by one unit ; it is optimal because it produces no further constraints and hence yields the maximal power of @xmath3 from index sums .",
    "we finally calculate the index sum : each of the @xmath655 2-cells of @xmath629 amounts to one free index giving a factor of @xmath3 ; there are no extra combinatorial factors , as the optimal permutation is unique for each block of @xmath519 ; hence the index sum equals @xmath656 .",
    "it follows that the total contribution to ( [ eq : mom - f - cum ] ) from @xmath518 is @xmath657 multiplied by @xmath658 now the euler characteristic of a disk @xmath597 is @xmath598 .",
    "therefore , since our complex @xmath629 shares with @xmath597 its simplicial homology by construction , we have the relation @xmath659 thus the total power is @xmath660 , which is canceled by the normalization factor @xmath661 in ( [ eq : mom - f - cum ] ) .    in summary ,",
    "the result of summing all contributions from non - crossing partitions is @xmath662 where the dots signify corrections from partitions @xmath663 and from the multi - trace terms indicated in ( [ multi - trace ] ) .",
    "the corrections to ( [ eq : speicher - c ] ) become negligible in the limit @xmath25 , and we now briefly discuss why . for that",
    ", we slightly expand our graphical representation .",
    "let still @xmath664 and consider once more the associated 2-complex @xmath629 .",
    "now , however , replace the arcs for each block of @xmath519 of length @xmath506 by a ` blob '  the sum of all perturbation theory graphs for the cumulant tensor of degree @xmath506  with @xmath506 external lines connecting it to the @xmath506 members of that block .",
    "the resulting graph is planar [ see figure [ fig : bild2 ] for how it looks in the case of our example ( [ eq : example ] ) ] .",
    "it is planar because the partition @xmath519 was taken to be non - crossing and the blobs were chosen to be full disks , as opposed to disks with one or several holes in them .",
    "now , inserting any correction of the multi - trace form ( [ multi - trace ] ) amounts to changing the topology of a blob from disk to annulus or higher genus .",
    "our graph then is no longer planar .",
    "the same goes for the replacement of @xmath518 by @xmath665 : the resulting graph can not be planar , as some lines emanating from the blobs must cross . as should be plausible by now , this loss of planarity results in the loss of at least one factor of @xmath3 .",
    "we therefore claim that all corrections vanish in the large-@xmath3 limit : @xmath666 this is speicher s formula ( [ eq : speicher ] ) , provided that we identify the coefficients @xmath12  unknowns for us up to now  with the free cumulants of free probability theory .    in summary , assuming that ( [ eq : expect ] ) holds , we have argued that the coefficients @xmath12 must be the free cumulants .",
    "this concludes our perturbation theory argument in support of ( [ eq : expect ] ) .",
    "compared to the ( non - perturbative ) reasoning of sections [ sect : dyson ] and [ sect : ff ] , this argument has the advantage that it applies to the general mixed case where @xmath667    * note added . * the large-@xmath3 hypothesis ( [ hypothesis ] ) with @xmath12 equal to the @xmath47 free cumulant ,",

    "the specific details of the probability measure @xmath14 enter only via the scale factor @xmath768 .",

    "the scale factor @xmath590 is needed in order to express the energy dependence of the correlation function in the proper units given by the mean level spacing . at the same time , the ` scattering observable ' @xmath770 is expressed in terms of the average @xmath678-matrix and physical quantities called ` sticking probabilities ' or transmission factors @xcite .",
    "when this is done , the correlation function assumes its universal form .",
    "let us finally give the reason why it was legitimate to neglect the @xmath601 corrections to @xmath771 .",
    "any such correction is @xmath763-invariant and , in fact , vanishes along the dominant saddle - point supermanifold .",
    "its only effect is to cause a slight perturbation of the scale of this supermanifold and correct the density of states by a term of order @xmath751 .",
    "this effect is negligible in the large-@xmath3 limit .",
    "in this paper , we employed a variety of techniques to study the characteristic function @xmath22 and its lift @xmath726 , which are key to a recent variant of the supersymmetry method , i.e. , the wegner - efetov technique of integration over commuting and anti - commuting variables .",
    "what we found is that the large-@xmath3 asymptotics of @xmath726 for any unitary ensemble ` close to gaussian ' is determined by the @xmath5-transform known from free probability theory .",

    "this insight opens the door to numerous applications which in the past had been beyond the reach of the supersymmetry method . in the present paper , we have given a first application to stochastic scattering , demonstrating the universality of @xmath678-matrix correlations for the case of unitary ensembles close to gaussian .",
