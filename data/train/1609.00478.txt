    "the equations of motion can be derived as follows , and first we consider the excited state population , & = & w_^gg-_^ee+(^_^- - _ ^+)-_^n_^n + & & ( _ ^+_^-_^ee + _ ^ee_^+_^- - 2_^+_^ee_^- ) + & -&_^n_^n ig_(_^ee_^+_^- - _ ^+_^-_^ee),[excited ] where the excited state population is repumped from the ground state population , and the cavity field builds up the atom - field correlation as expected .",
