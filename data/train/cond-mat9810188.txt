    "in the cholesteric liquid crystalline phase,@xcite anisotropic mesogens align on average along a local unit director @xmath15 that rotates in a helical fashion about a uniform pitch axis .",
    "the pitch @xmath2 of this helix ranges from a few tenths of a micron to ten or more microns .",
    "in fact , solutions of the viruses fd and tmv , as well as dna , have even much larger pitches.@xcite because the pitch is usually large compared to the intermolecular separation , these systems are locally essentially indistinguishable from nematics and consequently they are often referred to as chiral nematics ( cn s ) .",
    "the pitch wavenumber @xmath16 can even pass through zero as a function of temperature.@xcite the helical structure of a cholesteric phase must result from the molecular chirality of some or all of its constituent mesogens .",
    "achiral mesogens form an achiral nematic rather than a chiral nematic phase .",
    "phenomenologically , the explanation of the twist of the cholesteric phase is straightforward : chiral mesogens must lead to a chiral term @xmath17 in the long  wavelength free energy density that favors twist .",
    "this tendency to twist is resisted by a twist elastic energy density @xmath18 , where @xmath4 is the frank elastic constant for twist .",
    "if the pitch axis coincides with the @xmath19direction , then in the equilibrium configuration one has @xmath20 with @xmath21 ( our definition of @xmath14 is such that positive @xmath14 corresponds to right  handed macroscopic chirality.@xcite ) the magnitude of @xmath4 , which has units of energy per unit length , is estimated with good accuracy by dimensional analysis .",
    "the characteristic energy is of order the thermal energy , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the boltzman constant , @xmath24 is the temperature , and @xmath25 is the isotropic  to  nematic transition temperature . the characteristic length is a molecular length @xmath26 , so that @xmath27 .",
    "a similar dimensional analysis for the torque field @xmath5 , which has units of energy/(length@xmath28 ) , would predict @xmath29 and @xmath30 . this is a far tighter pitch than is observed in any cholesteric .",
    "this reasoning indicates that an explanation of the magnitude of @xmath5 requires considering a detailed model of the cholesteric .",
    "the chiral structure of cholesterics also raises some technological issues .",
    "it would be very desirable to be able to  engineer \" molecules that have specific values of @xmath5 and thus @xmath2 or more generally that have a specific temperature dependence for @xmath5 .",
    "to realize this goal , it is necessary to understand how variations in molecular architecture and electronic structure influence @xmath5 . as a first step in dealing with these issues of fundamental and applied science",
    ", this paper will address some aspects of the calculation of @xmath5 from a molecular model .",
    "in fact , the calculation of @xmath5 is highly nontrivial .",
    "it involves the rather complex interactions between mesogens and the orientational correlations they induce .",
    "if there are chiral mesogens , there are chiral interactions , and @xmath5 is nonzero ; otherwise , @xmath5 is zero .",
    "one typically identifies three types of interactions between molecules:@xcite ( 1 ) long  range attractive dispersion ( van der waals ) interactions , ( 2 ) short  range repulsive interactions , whose origin is the pauli principle , and ( 3 ) direct coulomb interactions , which take the form of dipolar , quadrupolar , etc .",
    "interactions between electrically neutral mesogens .",
    "the latter interactions are of secondary importance in many chiral and achiral liquid crystals and will be ignored here .",
    "initially straley@xcite proposed that the macroscopic chirality of cn s could be understood qualitatively in terms of the packing of screws .",
    "these short  range repulsive forces were modeled as hard  core or steric potentials,@xcite reflecting molecular shape , that contribute to the entropy but not the internal energy . for spherical atoms ,",
    "the repulsive and dispersion forces can be combined in a single effective potential such as the lennard - jones @xmath31 central  force potential .",
    "more generally , interactions between achiral molecules can be modeled as sums over central ",
    "force effective potentials between pairs of atoms or mass points on different molecules.@xcite there are chiral versions of both dispersion and short  range repulsive forces .",
    "chiral dispersion forces were first analyzed by goossens@xcite and later more systematically by others.@xcite they found that the dominant chiral interaction between chiral mesogens , calculated in the limit of center  of  mass separation @xmath32 much larger than any molecular dimension @xmath26 was proportional to @xmath33 and to the product of dipolar and quadrupolar molecular matrix elements .",
    "various somewhat ad hoc chiral intermolecular interactions , some based on implementing models equivalent to threaded rods,@xcite others on surface ",
    "nematic interactions of chiral dopants,@xcite have been introduced mostly as input to simulations of chiral systems .",
    "models for flexible mesogens have also been treated.@xcite    a chiral molecule is one that can not be rotated into coincidence with its mirror image.@xcite chiral molecules can not be uniaxial : at minimum , their description requires an orthonormal triad of vectors rather than a single vector .",
    "a microscopic description of chiral interactions involves the complete orthonormal triad of axes emblazoned on each of the two interacting molecules .",
    "however , as we have mentioned , apart from very small corrections arising from slow local twist , the cholesteric phase is locally uniaxial .",
    "it is , therefore , natural to seek effective chiral interactions between effectively uniaxial molecules .",
    "if a molecule @xmath10 of arbitrary shape is spun about some axis @xmath34 , it becomes on average uniaxial with respect to this axis .",
    "thus , general pair interactions between molecules @xmath8 and @xmath10 in a chiral nematic can be reduced to uniaxial pair interactions by averaging over independent rotations of each member of the pair about the local nematic director .",
    "the resulting potential is only approximate in that it ignores orientational correlations between molecules in the plane perpendicular to @xmath7 and @xmath34 . in practice , one usually averages over independent rotations of each molecule about its body axis @xmath35 , rather than the more correct average over rotations about the local nematic director .",
    "we mention that it is known that the chiral part of central  force potentials ( such as hard  body interactions ) vanishes when such correlations are neglected.@xcite however , dispersion contributions to the chiral interaction do not require nonzero orientational correlations between molecules . as discussed in appendix [ blurb ] and as has been found by several previous authors,@xcite the long",
    " range dispersion interaction survives this independent rotation procedure to produce an effective chiral potential between effectively uniaxial mesogens of the form @xmath36 where @xmath9 is the displacement of the center of molecule @xmath8 relative to the center of molecule @xmath10 and only terms in @xmath12 which are odd in both @xmath7 and @xmath34 are retained .",
    "the effective interaction of eq .",
    "( [ eijeq ] ) arises between two chiral molecules as well as between a chiral molecule and an achiral one .",
    "our derivation of the effective chiral interaction differs from previous ones@xcite in two important respects .",
    "first , previous calculations of this interaction are based on a multipole expansion in the variable @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the coordinate of the @xmath39th charge of molecule @xmath8 relative to the center of molecule @xmath8 .",
    "strictly speaking , the multipole expansion only applies when @xmath40 is large compared to any dimension of the molecules .",
    "this expansion does not apply to pairs of molecules whose separation is less than their length but greater than their width .",
    "we develop a modified multipole expansion in which coordinates transverse to long molecular axes are treated as small parameters .",
    "second , the results of previous calculations are expressed in terms of electric dipole and quadrupole matrix elements of the entire molecule .",
    "but in a long molecule , typical of those comprising liquid crystals , we expect the electronic states to be strongly localized.@xcite accordingly , it seems more useful to express results in terms of matrix elements within atoms or local complexes . in so doing ,",
    "it is natural to assume the relevant excited state can be reached from the ground state by matrix elements of the dipole moment operator .",
    "then , the quadrupole moment operator is easily related to the dipole moment operator , with the result that the only matrix elements appearing in the present paper are those of the dipole moment operator between local atomic states . in common with previous treatments",
    ", we will neglect the effects of biaxial correlations between interacting molecules .",
    "accordingly , we will evaluate @xmath12 by averaging each molecule independently over spinning about its long axis . in a separate paper@xcite",
    "we will discuss how the chiral interaction between helical molecules depends on the angles describing rotation about their longest body axis .",
    "we may summarize briefly the results of this program . although we do not expand in powers of the longitudinal coordinates of the charges in each molecule , our results are formally not very different from the previous ones.@xcite however , by expressing the results in terms of matrix elements of localized atomic orbitals , we identify two distinct physical mechanisms .",
    "the first is the dipole ",
    "quadrupole interaction previously identified .",
    "the second is one involving a three ",
    "body interaction between two local atomic dipole moments on one molecule and a local anisotropic polarizability of the second molecule .",
    "this second interaction , formally present in previous work , can dominate the first one in certain situations . furthermore , our approach allows us to discuss how these interactions depend on the length of the molecule . for a helical molecule",
    "we find that the contribution to @xmath12 due to the first mechanism is proportional to @xmath41 for @xmath42 and to @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "results for the three  body interaction are more complicated [ see eq .",
    "( [ kapreseq ] ) , below ] . in both cases ,",
    "the magnitude of the pitch arising from these interactions in a concentrated system of helical molecules with polarizability corresponding to a dielectric constant of about 1.3 would be 10 microns .",
    "this is a larger pitch than one observes for most concentrated cholesterics .",
    "it is possible that this discrepancy is due to some of the simplifying assumptions in our calculations most probably our disregard of biaxial correlations between molecules.@xcite alternatively , it is possible that the pitch of most cholesterics is determined by steric rather than by quantum interactions .",
    "elsewhere we will apply the approach of the present paper to obtain the quantum contributions to @xmath4.@xcite    briefly , this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we give an overview of the calculation of the torque field @xmath5 from which the macroscopic chiral pitch can be determined . in sec .",
    "iii we derive a rather general expression for the strength of the chiral interaction between molecules in terms of matrix elements of the dipole moment operators of atoms between the ground state and excited states localized on atoms .",
    "the contribution to this effective chiral interaction from virtual states in which both molecules are excited is treated in sec .",
    "iv and that in which only one molecule is excited is treated in sec . v. numerical estimates of the pitch for a system of helical molecules are given which show that the quantum mechanism when both molecules are excited is unlikely to explain the observed pitch of most cholesterics .",
    "our results and conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "in this section we give an overview and a summary of the results of the calculation , given in the next section , of the chiral interaction between molecules .",
    "recently@xcite a systematic formulation was given that expresses the macroscopic pitch of a cn in terms of microscopic interactions between molecules .",
    "such a formulation is required in cases where it is either necessary or desirable to include orientational correlations between interacting molecules .",
    "it was shown that for central  force interactions between atoms on different molecules , a nonzero effective chiral interaction between molecules could only be obtained when orientational correlations , specifically biaxial correlations , between molecules were taken into account .",
    "in contrast , in the present paper we will see that the quantum interactions between molecules are not of this type .",
    "thus , in the present context , it is permissible to use a simpler and more traditional approach in which each molecule is characterized by the orientation of its long axis , specified by the unit vector @xmath35 .",
    "we will then evaluate the chiral interaction energy between molecules @xmath8 and @xmath10 written in eq .",
    "( [ eijeq ] ) .",
    "this interaction energy is evaluated within what we will call the  uniaxial \" approximation in which we independently average over the orientations of the two molecules when @xmath35 is specified for each molecule . in order to calculate the macroscopic chiral pitch it is only necessary to evaluate the chiral part of this interaction , i. e. the part of the form written in eq .",
    "( [ eijeq ] ) .",
    "this interaction energy can then be added to whatever phenomenological interaction one is using to describe the nematic phase which would result in the absence of chiral interactions .    to make contact with a continuum theory ,",
    "one introduces a local order parameter tensor via @xmath45 when thermally averaged , this tensor becomes the usual de gennes ",
    "saupe order parameter.@xcite in the long  wavelength limit , the chiral interaction @xmath46 leads to a continuum interaction of the form @xmath47 where greek indices label cartesian components , @xmath48 is the kronecker delta , @xmath49 is the antisymmetric tensor , the repeated  index summation convention is understood , and the constant @xmath50 is the macroscopic analog of @xmath12 .",
    "if we express @xmath0 in terms of the director @xmath51 as @xmath52 where @xmath53 indicates a thermal average , then the above chiral interaction leads to the familiar frank free energy in the presence of macroscopic chiral twist ( but neglecting splay and bend distortions ) as@xcite @xmath54 ^ 2 + h \\int d{\\bf r }   { \\bf n}({\\bf r } ) \\cdot \\nabla \\times { \\bf n}({\\bf r } ) \\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , within mean  field theory , @xmath55 .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to obtain @xmath5 from a microscopic model .",
    "in particular we will obtain @xmath5 from an evaluation of @xmath12 in eq .",
    "( [ eijeq ] ) . as we have seen in eqs .",
    "( [ qeq ] ) and ( [ eqeq ] ) a determination of @xmath5 leads immediately to the determination of the macroscopic chiral wave vector @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , the chiral properties of an isotropic liquid consisting of chiral molecules , such as the rotary power , are also related to @xmath12 .    the interaction between molecules we are going to study is the generalization , for chiral molecules , of the attractive @xmath56 term in the van der waals potential between neutral spherical atoms . this calculation is based on a quantum mechanical treatment of the total coulomb interaction @xmath57 between charges on the two interacting molecules , @xmath8 and @xmath10 : @xmath58 where @xmath59 indicates that the sum is over all charges @xmath60 , both electronic and nuclear , in molecule @xmath8 and @xmath61 is the displacement of @xmath60 relative to @xmath62 . in this calculation",
    "we neglect any biaxial correlations between the orientations of the two molecules . within this assumption",
    "it has been shown@xcite that central force interactions [ like those of eq .",
    "( [ veq ] ) when taken in first order perturbation theory ] can not lead to any chiral interactions .",
    "therefore , we consider the effect of @xmath57 within second  order perturbation theory .",
    "the effective interaction between molecules @xmath8 and @xmath10 is then @xmath63 , with @xmath64 the energy of the ground state @xmath65 of @xmath66 the unperturbed hamiltonian describing noninteracting molecules , and @xmath67 is a projection operator that excludes the ground state .",
    "here we have indicated that @xmath46 depends on @xmath68 ( and @xmath69 ) which denotes the triad of euler angles ( see fig .",
    "[ euler ] ) needed to specify the orientation of the @xmath8th ( @xmath10th ) molecule and on @xmath9 .",
    "both @xmath9 and @xmath38 , the position of the @xmath39th charge in molecule @xmath8 relative to the center of the molecule , @xmath38 , may be expressed with respect to coordinate axes , @xmath70 , fixed in space , as shown in fig .",
    "[ spacef ] : @xmath71    we now must average this interaction energy over the orientations of the two molecules , when the long axes of molecules @xmath8 and @xmath10 are fixed to lie along the unit vectors @xmath7 and @xmath34 , respectively , and correlations between the orientations of the two molecules are neglected . to carry out this average we introduce",
    "axes specified by unit vectors @xmath72 emblazoned on the @xmath8th molecule , as shown in fig .",
    "[ euler ] , so that @xmath73 previously van der meer et al.@xcite carried out this averaging within the multipole expansion .",
    "however , since we wish to treat long molecules of the type usually constituting liquid crystals , we do not make the usual multipole expansion , but rather expand only in terms of transverse coordinates of the molecule .",
    "thus we set @xmath74 where @xmath75 .",

    "the expressions for @xmath12 in its most general form are not very enlightening , although they do display the appropriate symmetry to vanish for molecules which are not chiral . to gain some insight into the meaning of these results we have had recourse to a model of the excited states , which appear in second ",
