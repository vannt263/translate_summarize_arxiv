    "almost half a century ago , peierls demonstrated that a one - dimensional ( 1d ) metal coupled to an elastic lattice could exhibit an instability towards a lattice distortion of wave vector @xmath0.@xcite this leads to a gap in the electronic spectrum at the fermi energy and , for the case of a half - filled band , the ground state is dimerized .",
    "experimentally , the peierls instability can be observed in a wide range of quasi-1d materials , e.g. , conjugated polymers,@xcite organic charge transfer salts,@xcite mx salts,@xcite and @xmath1.@xcite to explain quantitatively the properties of these materials , several different models extending beyond the original non - interacting peierls model with a classical lattice have been proposed.@xcite these include the su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) model,@xcite the holstein model,@xcite various peierls - hubbard @xcite and extended peierls - hubbard @xcite models , as well as spin - peierls models . @xcite    the peierls instability is well understood in the static lattice limit ( adiabatic phonons ) in the absence of electron - electron ( e - e ) interactions .",
    "the ground state is a peierls state for arbitrarily small electron - phonon ( e - ph ) coupling .",
    "however , the quantum lattice and e - e interaction effects are still not completely understood . for many quasi-1d materials",
    "the zero - point fluctuations of the phonon field are comparable to the amplitude of the peierls distortion,@xcite and this has spurred a large number of studies of quantum fluctuations in ssh,@xcite and holstein , @xcite models .",
    "recent numerical studies have shown that quantum fluctuations destroy the peierls instability for small e - ph coupling and/or large phonon frequency in both the spinless @xcite and spin-@xmath2 holstein models @xcite at half - filling .",
    "for the ssh model , fradkin and hirsch@xcite carried out an extensive study of spin-@xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) and spinless ( @xmath5 ) fermions . in the anti - adiabatic limit ( vanishing ionic mass ) , they mapped the system to an @xmath6-component gross - neveu model , which is known to have long - ranged dimerization for arbitrary coupling for @xmath7 but not for @xmath5 .",
    "for non - zero ionic mass , a renormalization group analysis showed that the low - energy behavior of the @xmath4 model is still governed by the zero mass limit of the theory .",
    "this implies that the spin-@xmath3 ssh model ( but not the spinless model ) has a dimerized ground state for arbitrarily weak e - ph coupling .",
    "early numerical calculations are also consistent with this scenario.@xcite it should be noted , however , that a dimerized state was also predicted for any non - zero e - ph coupling in the spin-@xmath3 holstein model,@xcite for which more recent large - scale calculations have instead indicated a non - zero critical coupling.@xcite    independent - electron models , such as ssh and holstein , are important from a theoretical standpoint but are not sufficient to account quantitatively for the experimentally observed properties of real materials . for that e - e interactions have to be included in addition to the e - ph couplings .",
    "@xcite the interplay among the different interactions gives rise to a rich variety of broken - symmetry ground states as well as low - energy electron - lattice excitations like solitons , polarons , bipolarons , etc .",
    "@xcite at half - filling , on - site ( hubbard ) interactions open a charge gap,@xcite and in the absence of e - ph couplings the system is then a mott insulator with algebraically decaying ( @xmath8 as a function of distance @xmath9 ) spin - spin correlations .",
    "hence , the peierls transition in this case is accompanied only by the opening of a spin gap , the charge gap already generated by the e - e interactions .",
    "longer - range e - e interactions can destroy the mott state , however , and hence must affect also the mott - peierls transition . without phonons , even in the simplest half - filled extended hubbard model with only on - site ( @xmath10 ) and nearest - neighbor ( @xmath11 ) interactions , @xcite",
    "some features of the phase diagram are still controversial .",
    "@xcite adding e - ph interactions further increases the complexity of the problem , and the determination of the phase diagram remains a very challenging problem .",
    "zimanyi et al.@xcite have investigated models with both e - e and e - ph interactions using `` g - ology '' and rg techniques .",
    "they showed that the ground state has a spin gap if the combined backscattering amplitude @xmath12 is negative , where @xmath13 is the contribution from e - e interactions and @xmath14 comes from the e - ph interactions .",
    "thus , in the extended hubbard model , if the bare coupling @xmath15 is positive , then @xmath16 for small values of the e - ph coupling and there is no spin gap .",
    "the transition to a peierls state occurs only when the e - ph coupling exceeds a critical value and @xmath17 becomes negative .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the conventional scenario for the behavior close to the line @xmath18 has recently been challenged @xcite and a peierls - like bond - ordered state most likely appears close to @xmath19 _ even in the absence of e - ph couplings_. for the pure ssh model ( @xmath20 ) , @xmath21 is zero and @xmath17 is negative for any non - zero e - ph coupling .",
    "this implies a peierls ground state for arbitrarily small e - ph coupling , in agreement with the earlier results of fradkin and hirsch.@xcite    in the limit of strong on - site e - e interactions , which inhibit doubly occupied sites , a half - filled system can be mapped to a spin - phonon model , which also can undergo a dimerization ( spin - peierls ) transition .",
    "@xcite extensive studies of spin - peierls models in recent years @xcite have largely been spurred by the discovery of a spin - peierls transition at unusually high temperature ( 14  k ) in @xmath1.@xcite several different calculations , for different types of spin - phonon couplings , have shown that the transition occurs only above a finite spin - phonon coupling in the presence of finite - frequency phonons.@xcite this is in contrast to the adiabatic limit , where dimerization occurs for infinitesimal coupling.@xcite    numerical studies of models with both e - ph and e - e interactions , in which the charge degrees of freedom are retained ( peierls - hubbard and extended peierls hubbard models ) , have addressed the effect of interactions on the dimerization amplitude @xcite and the excited states .",
    "@xcite detailed studies of the phase diagrams have in the past been limited by the small lattice sizes accessible when both e - e and e - ph interactions are included.@xcite the situation is rapidly improving , however , as modern quantum monte carlo @xcite and density matrix renormalization group @xcite methods can now access models with both e - e and e - ph interactions on chains with several hundred sites .",
    "here we consider a 1d extended hubbard model with on - site ( @xmath10 ) and nearest - neighbor ( @xmath11 ) e - e interactions and couple it to dispersionless optical bond phonons via modulation of the electron kinetic energy .",
    "we study the transition from a mott insulating state , with dominant spin - spin correlations , to a peierls ( dimerized ) spin - gapped state .",
    "since the parameter space of this model is rather large , with a bare phonon frequency ( @xmath22 ) and an e - ph coupling ( @xmath23 ) in addition to the e - e couplings , we have limited our study to a physically reasonable ratio @xmath24 of the e - e parameters .    in sec .",

    "the dispersionless optical phonons we use are different from the bare ssh phonons , which have vanishing energy for momentum @xmath38 .",
    "however , these acoustic phonons decouple from the electronic low - energy states involved in the peierls instability and therefore only the optical phonons close to @xmath39 need to be kept.@xcite hence , in this regard we expect the optical phonons in ( [ eqn : h ] ) to be equivalent to fully quantum mechanical ssh phonons . in the non - interacting limit ( @xmath40 )",
    ", the ground state should therefore be a dimerized peierls insulator for any non - zero @xmath23.@xcite    to obtain numerically exact ground state results we have used the stochastic series expansion ( sse ) quantum monte carlo method @xcite for periodic chains with up to @xmath41 sites .",

    "the mott and peierls phases can be characterized using the static spin ( s ) and bond ( b ) structure factors and susceptibilities , as will be further discussed in sec .",

    "because of this , standard spin - phonon models , where the nonlinear term is not included , can not be expected to reproduce fully the phase diagrams of electron - phonon models .    the methods that we have used here should also be applicable to systems away from half - filling .",
