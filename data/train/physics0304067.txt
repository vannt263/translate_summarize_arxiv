    "the pauli principle states that no two fermions can have the same quantum numbers .",
    "the origin of this law is the required antisymmetry of the multi - fermion wavefunction .",
    "most physicists have heard or read a shorthand way of expressing the pauli principle , which says something analogous to fermions being `` antisocial '' and bosons `` gregarious . '' quite often",
    "this intuitive approach involves the statement that there is an effective repulsion between two fermions , sometimes called an `` exchange force , '' that keeps them spacially separated .",
    "we inquire into the validity of this heuristic point of view and find that the suggestion of an effective repulsion between fermions or an attraction between bosons is actually quite a dangerous concept , especially for beginning students , since it often leads to an inaccurate physical interpretation and sometimes to incorrect results .",
    "we argue that the effective interaction interpretation of the pauli principle ( or bose principle ) should almost always be replaced by some alternate physical interpretation that better reveals the true physics .",
    "physics comes in two parts : the precise mathematical formulation of the laws , and the conceptual interpretation of the mathematics .",
    "david layzer says,@xcite `` there is a peculiar synergy between mathematics and ordinary language.the two modes of discourse [ words and symbols ] stimulate and reinforce one another .",
    "without adequate verbal support , the formulas and diagrams tend to lose their meaning ; without formulas and diagrams , the words and phrases refuse to take on new meanings . ''",
    "interpreting the meaning of wavefunction symmetry or antisymmetry in a simple pedagogical representation is thus vitally important .",
    "however , if those words actually convey the wrong meaning of the mathematics , they must be replaced by more accurate words .",
    "we feel this is the situation with the heuristic `` effective repulsion '' for fermions or `` effective attraction '' for bosons , or `` exchange force '' generally .",
    "one can demonstrate there is no real force due to fermi / bose symmetries by examining a time - dependent wave packet for two noninteracting spinless fermions .",
    "consider the antisymmetric wave function for one - dimensional gaussian wave packets , each satisfying the schrdinger equation , and moving towards each other : @xmath0 \\right .",

    ", each single - particle packet will spread with time , but we assume that the spreading is negligible over the short time that we consider the system . at @xmath7",
    "the @xmath5-packet is peaked at @xmath8 and moving to the right with velocity @xmath9 , while the @xmath6-packet is peaked at @xmath10 and traveling to the left with the same velocity .",
    "of course we can not identify which particle is in which packet since they are indistinguishable , and each has a probability of being in each packet . at @xmath7",
    "the packets are assumed well separated with little overlap .    at @xmath11",
    "the wave function becomes @xmath12 -f(x_{2},x_{1})\\exp \\left [ -\\alpha ( x_{2})^{2}-\\beta \\left ( x_{1}\\right ) ^{2}\\right ] \\right\\},\\ ] ] and the direct and exchange parts have maximal overlap .",
    "the wave function clearly vanishes at @xmath13 ( as it does at all times ) . at the time @xmath14 the packets have passed through one another and overlap",
    "very little again : @xmath15 \\right .",

    "the packets have moved through one another unimpeded since , after all , they represent free - particle wave functions . describing this process in terms of effective forces",
    "would imply the presence of scattering and accelerations , which do not occur here , and would be highly misleading .",
    "nonetheless , the concept of effective fermion repulsion is evident in many texts , particularly in discussions of the behavior of an ideal fermion gas  a case we explore further in section ii .",
    "a common usage of the repulsion idea is in the interpretation of the second virial coefficient of an ideal gas .",
    "the first correction to classical ideal gas pressure due just to statistics is positive for spinless fermions and negative for spinless bosons .",
    "( similar to most other texts that treat the subject , including one authored by one of us@xcite ) says , `` the quantum correction that is introduced by statistics appears as an attractive potential for be [ bose - einstein ] statistics and as a repulsive potential for fd [ fermi - dirac ] statistics . ''",
    "patria s book@xcite carries the idea further , developing an actual mathematical formula for the effective interaction between fermions or between bosons ! he says , `` in the bose case , the potential is throughout attractive , thus giving rise to a ` statistical attraction ' among bosons ; in the fermi case , it is throughout repulsive , giving a ` statistical repulsion ' among fermions . ''",
    "this interaction formula first appeared in 1932 in an article by unlenbeck and gropper,@xcite who may well be the originators of the whole statistical interaction picture .",
    "we discuss this formula in more detail in the next section .",
    "wannier@xcite is a bit stronger in his assessment of the quantum thermal distribution function for fermions : `` the particles exert a very strong influence on each other because a particle occupying a state excludes the others from it .",
    "this is equivalent to a strong repulsive force comparable to the strongest forces occurring in the problem . ''",
    "the modern physics book of leighton@xcite omits the word `` effective '' in discussing the so - called fermion interaction : `` as compared with the behavior of hypothetical but distinguishable particles , bose particles exhibit an additional attraction for one another and tend to be found near one another in space ; fermi particles , on the contrary , repel one another and tend not to be found near one another in space . ''",
    "the classic kinetic - theory handbook by herschfelder et al@xcite may set the record by using the terms `` apparent repulsion '' ( and `` apparent attraction '' ) four times .",
    "griffiths@xcite does an interesting calculation of the average distance between two particles at positions @xmath1 and @xmath2 when one is in state @xmath17 and the other in @xmath18 the two functions being orthogonal and normalized .",
    "for distinguishable particles with wave function @xmath19 the mean - square separation is @xmath20 where @xmath21 for spinless fermions the wave function must be antisymmetrized , and for bosons symmetrized , giving @xmath22 ,    \\label{symwf}\\ ] ] where the upper sign is for bosons and the lower for fermions . from this form",
    "it is easy to compute the corresponding mean - square separation as @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "thus he finds that bosons tend to be closer together and fermions farther apart when compared to distinguishable particles .",
    "griffiths comments , `` the system behaves as though there were a ` force of attraction ' between identical bosons , pulling them closer together , and a ` force of repulsion ' between identical fermions , pushing them apart .",
    "we call it an exchange force , although it s not really a force at all  no physical agency is pushing on the particles ; rather it is a purely a geometrical consequence of the symmetrization requirement . ''",
    "this wording shows more care than the works cited above and is thus less likely to be misinterpreted .",
    "however , the term `` force '' has explicit meaning for physicists .",
    "it implies a push or pull , along with its associated acceleration , deflection , scattering , etc .",
    "are these elements properly associated with the exchange force ?",
    "if not , then the term should be replaced with something carrying more accurate connotations .",
    "our intention is not to be critical of authors for using the words `` repulsion '' and `` attraction '' in describing the statistical effects of wavefunction antisymmetry or symmetry .",
    "this concept has been with physics since the early days of quantum mechanics .",
    "nevertheless , it is important to examine the usefulness of this heuristic interpretation of the mathematics .",
    "as layzer has pointed out , no such interpretation can carry the whole weight of the rigorous mathematical formulation ; however , if a heuristic interpretation brings along the baggage of subsequent misconceptions , then physicists must be more circumspect in its use .    for example ,",
    "consider the following case where there is a complete breakdown of the concept .",
    "suppose two spinless fermions or bosons have a completely repulsive interparticle potential and impinge on one another at energies low enough that there is only s - wave scattering . as we show in sec .",
    "[ sec : badidea ] , if the scattering amplitude for distinguishable particles is @xmath25 , then the scattering amplitude for fermions vanishes identically , whereas for that for bosons is @xmath26 . in this case statistical symmetry",
    "has _ diminished _ the interaction for fermions  not made it more repulsive  and it has _ enhanced _",
    "the interaction for bosons  not made it less repulsive .",
    "wherever the idea of an effective force breaks down ( as it does in our wave - packet description and in the s - wave scattering example ) , we need to replace this interpretation with other heuristic interpretations that better represent the physics .",
    "this is our aim in each of the examples we analyze below .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : repulsion ] we examine more closely the physics that gives rise to the idea of an effective statistical interaction between quantum particles and will derive the uhlenbeck - gropper formula for the interaction .",
    "section  [ sec : badidea ] will take the opposite point of view , and find cases where the idea is highly misleading and indeed where the effect is actually opposite the usual implication .",
    "[ sec : discuss ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "there are several places where the idea of a statistical interaction arises somewhat naturally , and might seem to imply an effective force .",
    "the virial correction to the pressure of an ideal gas is most likely the origin of this idea of effective interaction .",
    "the physics of white dwarf stars is another classic example of `` fermi repulsion . ''",
    "the diatomic hydrogen atom is bound in the electron singlet state , while the triplet is unbound , which is often used as an example of the effective repulsion between like - spin electrons due to the paul principle .",
    "when two rare gas atoms approach one another there is a hard - core exponential repulsion between the atoms , which is often explained by the electron statistical repulsion . on the other hand when trapped bosons condense , they collapse to a smaller region in the center of the trap ; which gives the impression of an effective boson statistical attraction . in each of these cases",

    "_ scattering theory_. when two particles scatter elastically via a repulsive force the idea of an additional effective interaction due to fermi or bose symmetry can lead to trouble . in the center - of - mass frame the two particles approach from opposite directions and",
    "scatter into opposite directions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : twopartscatt]a .",
    "if the particles are distinguishable , the probability of detecting particle p1 in detector d1 and particle p2 in detector d2 is given by @xmath145 where @xmath146 is the scattering amplitude@xcite .",
    "similarly , the probability of detecting particle p2 in detector d1 and particle p1 in d2 ( as in figure [ fig : twopartscatt]b ) is given by @xmath147 when you do nt care which particle goes to which detector , but just want to measure the cross section for either particle in a detector , the probability for a particle in detector d1 is @xmath148 since the particles are in principle distinguishable there is no interference between amplitudes , even if the detectors themselves do not identify the difference between particles .",
    "now suppose the two particles are indistinguishable . in this case",
    "the two amplitudes corresponding to figs .",
    "[ fig : twopartscatt]a and [ fig : twopartscatt]b interfere , and must be combined before squaring .",
    "if the particles are identical fermions , the two - particle wave function is antisymmetric with respect to particle exchange . since diagrams [ fig : twopartscatt]a and [ fig : twopartscatt]b are related by the exchange of the two particles in the final state , they contribute to the total amplitude with opposite signs .",
    "thus , the probability to detect a fermion in detector d1 is @xmath149 this is obviously different from the distinguishable case above .",
    "the difference is especially remarkable at @xmath150 , where the fermion scattering probability vanishes .",
    "moreover , in the limit of s - wave scattering , which is a good approximation for some low energy cases , the scattering is independent of the angle @xmath151 and the fermion probability for scattering is zero for all angles .",
    "a similar argument holds for bosons , but with the amplitudes adding instead of subtracting , leading to the scattering probability : @xmath152 in this case , the scattering probability at @xmath150 is twice the value for distinguishable particles . for s - wave scattering @xmath153 is a factor of two times the distinguishable value at all angles .",
    "the interpretation of these results in the context of an effective fermion repulsion or an effective boson attraction is quite confusing . for scattering at 90 degrees , or for s - wave scattering at all angles",
    ", it looks as if the total repulsive force is reduced in the case of fermions ( leading to a smaller scattering probability ) and enhanced in the case of bosons ( leading to a larger scattering probability ) .",
    "this is exactly backwards from the notion that the scattering force should be supplemented by an effective repulsion for fermions and partially canceled by an effective attraction for bosons .",
    "it clearly demonstrates why the idea of an effective repulsion or attraction is a dangerous concept .",
    "focusing on the direct effects of the bose or fermi symmetry leads to a more useful conceptual approach to scattering .",
    "for two identical particles , the total spin state is symmetric . for fermions having a total spin state that is symmetric ( either both spins up or both spins down ) ,",
    "the space wave function itself must be antisymmetric as written in eq .",
    "( [ symwf ] ) . for this wave function , the amplitude for the two fermions to be in the same place ( @xmath154 ) is obviously zero . as noted in sec .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , two identical fermions are on average farther apart than two distinguishable particles would be under the same circumstances .",
    "consequently , the fermions interact _ less _ and are less likely to scatter .",
    "one can similarly argue that bosons are closer together on average , interact more and are _ more _ likely to scatter .",
    "this conclusion is true whether the scattering force is repulsive or attractive , but it depends critically on the spin state of the two particles . for identical particles the spin state is necessarily symmetric , forcing the fermion spatial wave function to be antisymmetric or the boson wave function to be symmetric .",
    "however , if the two particles are in an antisymmetric spin state , e.g. , two fermions in a spin - zero state , the conditions are reversed .    as a specific example of repulsive scattering , consider the quantum electrodynamic interaction of two electrons ( moller scattering ) . in qed",
    ", there are two lowest - order feynman diagrams that contribute to the scattering amplitude with opposite signs , corresponding to the direct and exchange diagrams of figure [ fig : twopartscatt ] . in the non - relativistic limit ,",
    "the electron spins do not change as a result of the interaction .",
    "( this is due to the fact that the low energy interaction occurs primarily via an electric field . )",
    "there is then only one final spin state to consider when doing the calculation .",
    "if the initial state has both particles with spin up then the final state also has both spins up .",
    "this case is treated in introductory particle - physics texts@xcite and the cross section for scattering is @xmath155 where @xmath5 is the fine structure constant and @xmath156 is momentum of the electrons in the center - of - mass frame .",
    "one notes that the cross section at @xmath157 vanishes , as it should .    to explore the case of an antisymmetric spin wave function",
    ", one can also calculate the scattering cross section for electrons in a spin - zero state : @xmath158 this differs from the identical spin case in the relative sign of the two terms .",
    "these results should be compared to what the cross section would be if the two electrons were distinguishable . in that case ,",
    "only the direct diagram of contributes , and the cross section for scattering with both spins up turns out to be the same as the spin - averaged cross section for electron - muon scattering found in many texts , with the muon mass set equal to the electron mass .",
    "after symmetrizing around @xmath159 to account for detectors that are sensitive to either particle , the cross section can be written as @xmath160    all three cases are plotted as a function of scattering angle in fig .",
    "[ fig : mollerxsection]a .",
    "all cross sections are symmetric around @xmath161 , so only the range 0 to @xmath161 is plotted . as expected , the symmetric spin case gives the smallest scattering cross section , the antisymmetric spin case gives the largest cross section , and the case of distinguishable particles is in between .",
    "moreover , as fig .",
    "[ fig : mollerxsection]b shows , the ratios of the cross sections change as a function of scattering angle . at small scattering angles ,",
    "the fermion cross sections are almost the same as the distinguishable particle cross section .",
    "the maximum difference occurs at @xmath150 .",
    "it is difficult for any kind of effective fermion interaction to capture this effect , and moreover , the idea of an effective fermi repulsion gives the wrong sign in the case of a repulsive scattering force .",
    "_ transport theory_. consider the example of thermal conductivity in a polarized fermion gas",
    ". one might think from the idea of pauli repulsion that increasing polarization would _ shorten _ the particle s mean - free path in the gas , which in turn would lower the thermal conductivity @xmath162 .",
    "the opposite behavior is more likely to happen . at sufficiently low temperature",
    "where s - wave scattering predominates , polarization will actually cause a dramatic increase in @xmath162 , because , as we have just seen , the s - wave scattering cross section between like - spin fermions vanishes and only scattering between unlike spins , which now happens less often , can contribute to the mean free path .",
    "we treat a gas obeying boltzmann statistics , but having full quantum - mechanical collisions . for this to be true",
    ", the debroglie wavelength must be larger than the scattering length , but smaller than the average separation between particles .",
    "if the temperature is low enough s - wave scattering will predominate .",
    "this situation can occur , for example , in trapped fermi or bose gases .",
    "the heat current for spin species @xmath163 in temperature gradient @xmath164 is given by arguments analogous to those for an unpolarized gas@xcite : @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the density of @xmath167 spins , @xmath168 is the average velocity of either spin species , @xmath169 is the mean free path of a @xmath167 spin and @xmath31 , the boltzmann constant , is the specific heat per molecule . in eq .",
    "( [ spincurrent ] ) @xmath163 is @xmath170 for up spins and @xmath171 for down spins ; there is a separate heat equation for each spin species .",
    "we have dropped any constant factors in the expression .",
    "when s - wave scattering dominates , up spins can interact only with down spins and not with each other , and vice versa .",
    "thus the mean free path is @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the inverse of the scattering rate given by @xmath174 with @xmath175 the cross section for spin up - down scattering .",
    "the spin density @xmath176 occurs on the right in eq .",
    "( [ rate ] ) because it is that of the target particles for the incoming @xmath167 spins .",
    "the result is that @xmath177 if @xmath178 , the heat current @xmath179 for down spins is negligible compared to @xmath180 for the up spins and the thermal conductivity is @xmath181 for high polarizations ( @xmath178 ) @xmath182 can be very large .",
    "the increase in @xmath162 and other transport coefficients for polarized systems has been predicted theoretically@xcite and also seen experimentally.@xcite a similar increase also occurs if the particles are degenerate .",

    "ferromagnetism_. a very simple mean - field picture of magnetic fluids is provided by a model in which the particles interact by s - wave scattering only.@xcite thus again there is no up - up or down - down interactions and the energy of the system of @xmath183 up spins and @xmath184 down spins is given by @xmath185 where @xmath186 is the total kinetic energy of the @xmath187 spins , which is proportional to @xmath188 as in the ideal fermi gas .",
    "the interaction parameter @xmath189 measures the scattering energy between up and down spins . two up spins ( or two down spins ) do not `` see '' each other in this model . if @xmath190 this model has three possible states .",
    "if @xmath189 is small , then the system favors less kinetic energy by having @xmath191 that is , one has antiferromagnetism .",
    "however , if @xmath189 is large enough , then either all the spins are up or all down to minimize the potential energy ; ferromagnetism results .",
    "the kinetic energy in this case is larger than it would be if @xmath192 but the potential energy is zero .",
    "the wave - function antisymmetry between two like spins has made them invisible to one another and non - interacting , because their minimum separation is greater than the range of the interaction .",
    "the idea of a pauli exchange force would lead one to assume a higher associated potential energy ( as in eq .",
    "( [ ugpot ] ) ) , but what actually happens is that the _ kinetic _",
    "energy is raised by having more like spins , while at the same time statistics favors _ lowering _ the potential energy .",
    "our goals in this paper have been to clarify the idea of the statistical effects sometimes referred to as `` exchange forces '' .",
    "we believe the term `` force '' used in this context may mislead students ( and even more advanced workers ) , who might misinterprete the geometrical effect being described .",
    "we have given several examples of instances where statistical or exchange forces have been invoked to provide a conceptual explanation of the physics .",
    "we have not introduced any new physics in these examples , but we have tried to show how a teacher or writer might provide an alternative interpretation that avoids the exchange force terminology and thereby arrives at a deeper heuristic understanding of the physics .",
    "indeed we identified several cases where the concept of an effective statistical force could lead to the opposite of the correct answer .",
    "when a concept has that potential , it is time to replace it .",
    "our alternative heuristics have taken several forms .",
    "we like griffiths@xcite wording : `` it is not really a force at all  it is purely a geometric consequence of the symmetrization requirement . '' for same - spin fermions , the requirement that the wave function vanish whenever two particles are at the same position means that the wave function must have increased curvature , which leads to an enhanced momentum distribution . indeed in many cases , the real statistical effect corresponds to a change in _",
    "kinetic _ energy ( i. e. , momentum distribution ) as in the explanation of the virial pressure or the white dwarf star , whereas a force picture leads to a change in _ potential _ energy as in the unlenbeck - gropper potential of eq .",
    "( [ ugpot ] ) .",
    "equally helpfully , the geometrical interpretation leads directly to the changes in average particle separation as compared to distinguishable particles , with same - spin fermions farther apart on average , which nicely explains the scattering results where same - spin fermions have a reduced interaction .",
    "it is hard to underestimate the importance of the the conceptual element of physics .",
    "whole introductory courses have been constructed that leave out much of the mathematical half and concentrate only on the so - called `` conceptual '' side of the subject.@xcite moreover , we emphasize to our students that they have not understood a theory until they can describe the physics in simple conceptual terms .",
    "given that emphasis , we offer the following guiding principle regarding statistical symmetries : `` may the force be _ not _ with you . ''                                    c. herring , `` critique of the heitler - london method of calculating spin couplings at large distances , '' rev .",
