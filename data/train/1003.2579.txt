    "we consider boussinesq convection in a plane horizontal layer heated from below with stress - free horizontal boundaries . for small rayleigh numbers @xmath1 , i.e. for small temperature differences between the lower and upper boundaries , the fluid is not moving and the heat is transported by thermal diffusion only . as @xmath1 exceeds the critical value @xmath3 , the fluid motion sets in .",
    "the motion takes the form of rolls .",
    "we denote by @xmath4 the horizontal wave number of the mode becoming unstable the first .",
    "( by a horizontal wave number we understand the length of the horizontal component of the wave vector . ) in this paper we study analytically and numerically stability of rolls of a horizontal wave number close to @xmath4 for the rayleigh number slightly above @xmath3 .",
    "instability of rolls in a convective layer was studied analytically by a number of authors .",
    "an instability of rolls specific for stress - free boundaries is known , which does not occur in a layer whose one or both horizontal boundaries are rigid .",
    "its presence relies on existence of a slowly decaying large - scale mode .",
    "zippelius and siggia ( 1982 , 1983 ) were the first to study the instability of this kind . in the leading order",
    "the unstable mode is a sum of a large - scale mode and of two short - scale modes with wave vectors close to the one of the perturbed rolls . in the study of stability of rolls in a rotating convective layer it was called _",
    "small angle _ instability ( cox and matthews 2000 ) .    by deriving",
    "amplitude equations , zippelius and siggia obtained sufficient conditions for instability of rolls , in particular , they found that for @xmath5 ( @xmath6 denoting the prandtl number ) no stable rolls existed near the onset .",
    "their results were questioned by busse and bolton ( 1984 ) , who found boundaries for instabilities of rolls by direct calculations of the unstable mode , and claimed that no stable rolls were present near the onset only for @xmath7 .",
    "their results were confirmed by bernoff ( 1994 ) , who studied instability of rolls applying ginzburg - landau equations .",
    "the conflict between the results of zippelius and siggia ( 1982 , 1983 ) and busse and bolton ( 1984 ) was resolved by mielke ( 1997 ) , who studied stability of rolls by means of lyapunov - schmidt reduction and showed that instability boundaries had been found in these papers for different unstable modes .",
    "the problem of stability of rolls involves five small parameters : two wave numbers of the large scale mode , overcriticality , the difference between the wave number of perturbed rolls and the critical wave number , and the growth rate ( depending on the first four ) .",
    "zippelius and siggia postulated asymptotic relations between the parameters , different from those postulated by busse and bolton , and hence different instability modes were examined",
    ".    however , in all these studies some asymptotic relations between the small parameters of the problem were assumed , and thus stability only to selected types of perturbations was studied .",
    "hence , only _ instability _ of rolls was proven ( as it is discussed in introduction and conclusion in mielke ( 1997 ) and also section 3 of bernoff ( 1994 ) .",
    "the question , whether other unstable modes corresponding to other asymptotic scalings exist , remains open .",
    "another question asked by busse and bolton ( 1984 ) and bernoff ( 1994 ) and not answered by previous studies is whether enough terms of asymptotic expansions were taken into account . for four independent small parameters",
    "this is a hard question !    in the present paper",
    "both difficulties are resolved .",
    "we do not assume any asymptotic relations between the small parameters , hence instability with respect to all perturbations of the small - angle type is examined .",
    "an unstable mode is represented as a series in small parameters , with estimates for the remainder .",
    "( estimates for omitted terms were not given before . )",
    "a condition for instability has the form of inequalities .",
    "we demonstrate that in these inequalities the omitted terms are asymptotically smaller than the terms retained in the analysis .",
    "we also study instability to perturbations of a different kind , which are in the leading order convective rolls with the horizontal wave number close to the critical one , and a finite angle between wave vectors of the perturbed rolls and of the perturbation , which we call a _",
    "finite angle _ instability .",
    "furthermore , we show that stability to all considered perturbations implies stability to a much wider class of doubly periodic in horizontal directions perturbations .",
    "we show , that the domain of the linearisation operator , acting on vector fields satisfying the assumed boundary conditions on the horizontal boundaries and doubly periodic in horizontal directions , splits into a direct sum of invariant subspaces .",
    "thus investigation of instability is reduced to detection of instability modes in these invariant subspaces .",
    "any instability mode in such a subspace is either of a small angle or finite angle type .",
    "therefore , our study of instabilities of rolls with respect to perturbations which are doubly periodic in some directions in the @xmath8 plane is complete : we demonstrate _ stability _ of rolls for which instability is not detected in our analysis .",
    "this is also a novel feature of our investigation : all previous papers focused exclusively on instability .",
    "we estimate analytically the asymptotics of the most unstable mode and its growth rate on different parts of the @xmath2 plane and calculate the instability boundaries estimating the orders of the neglected terms ( which was not yet done in literature ) .    we are using notation and some results of podvigina ( 2008 ) , referred to as op2008 , where instability of flows in a rotating convective layer with stress - free boundaries was studied .",
    "stability of rolls in a layer with stress - free boundaries was studied by direct computations of dominant eigenvalues by bolton and busse ( 1985 ) .",
    "their numerical results agree well with the theoretical predictions of busse and bolton ( 1984 ) , in particular , they found that for @xmath9 rolls are stable near the onset .",
    "however , mielke ( 1997 ) claimed that stable rolls near the onset for @xmath5 are absent ; he did not comment on the disagreement with the numerical results of bolton and busse ( 1985 ) .",
    "in contrast to ( bolton and busse 1985 ) , our computations of stability modes indicate that rolls are unstable at the onset for @xmath5 , albeit in a small neighbourhood of the point @xmath10 on the @xmath2 plane . for @xmath6 decreasing below @xmath11 , the right boundary of the area of stable rolls slowly moves to the left , away from the point @xmath10 .",
    "boussinesq thermal convection satisfies the navier - stokes equation @xmath12 the incompressibility condition @xmath13 and the heat transfer equation @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the flow velocity and @xmath16 is the deviation of the flow temperature from the linear profile . @xmath1 and @xmath6 are dimensionless parameters , the rayleigh and prandtl numbers , respectively .",
    "stress - free horizontal boundaries held at fixed temperature are assumed : @xmath17    the trivial solution @xmath18 describing pure thermal conduction loses stability to perturbations of wave number @xmath0 at @xmath19 , where @xmath20 the critical horizontal wave number @xmath4 for the onset of convection is @xmath21 , the respective critical value @xmath22 .",
    "we employ four - dimensional vectors @xmath23    for a rayleigh number slightly above the critical value , @xmath24 a solution to ( [ nst])-([bouc ] ) can be represented as a power series @xmath25 the first two terms of the solution representing rolls are @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is an eigenvector of the linearisation of ( [ nst])-([heat ] )  ) , @xmath28 where @xmath29",

    "the operator can be expanded in a series @xmath32 here the first term is @xmath33    we consider the eigenvalue problem @xmath34 in op2008 a three - dimensional invariant subspace of @xmath31 was considered , and the problem of stability of rolls was reduced to the analysis of eigenvalues of @xmath31 in this subspace .",

    "the case of an unstable mode from this subspace is called _ small angle _ instability , because the angles between the wave vector @xmath45 of perturbed rolls and the wave vectors @xmath59 of short - scale components of perturbation ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 in the leading order ) are small . in section 5",
    "we also study stability with respect to perturbations of the form of rolls at an angle @xmath62 to the perturbed ones , where @xmath62 is finite ( and not asymptotically small ) . in the remaining part of the section it is shown that any growing mode of @xmath31 belongs to one of these two classes .    consider the space @xmath63 of 4-component vector fields of the form ( [ fcom ] ) , such that @xmath64 and @xmath65 + @xmath66 are linear combinations of harmonics with wave vectors @xmath67 or @xmath68 , where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are integer , + @xmath71 are symmetric about the vertical axis , i.e. + @xmath72 @xmath73 satisfy the boundary conditions ( [ bouc ] ) , + @xmath74 @xmath64 is divergence - free . + it was shown in op2008 that @xmath75 is @xmath31-invariant for any ( not necessarily small ) @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "let the subspace @xmath76 be defined like we have defined @xmath63 , but omitting the condition @xmath71 .",
    "such subspaces also are @xmath31-invariant .",
    "we consider perturbations which are doubly periodic on the @xmath8 plane .",
    "let the domain of @xmath31 be comprised of 4-component vector fields , for which @xmath73 and @xmath74 are satisfied , and which have the same double periodicity on the @xmath8 plane .",
    "the domain can be split into a sum of invariant spaces @xmath76 ; hence we can assume that a mode belongs to such an invariant subspace .",
    "any mode can be represented as a sum of a symmetric and an antisymmetric vector field ; each of these vector fields is itself a mode , since the subspaces of symmetric and an antisymmetric vector fields are @xmath31-invariant .",
    "moreover , in a coordinate system with the origin shifted by half a period , @xmath77 , in the @xmath78direction ( this shift does not affect rolls , since they are independent of the @xmath79 coordinate ) the antisymmetric modes become symmetric . in the case @xmath80 ,",
    "if integer @xmath81 and @xmath82 such that @xmath83 exist , the shift of the origin by @xmath84 along the @xmath85direction turns a symmetric mode into an antisymmetric one . for a given @xmath0 and @xmath43",
    "the ratio @xmath86 can be arbitrary close to @xmath87 .",
    "consequently , without any loss of generality we consider henceforth only modes belonging to @xmath75",
    ".    eigenvalues of ( [ seril ] ) are perturbations of the ones of @xmath49 .",
    "positive or slightly negative eigenvalues of @xmath49 are associated with eigenvectors , whose wave vectors are either @xmath88 ( large - scale mode ) or @xmath89 with @xmath0 close to @xmath4 ( see , e.g. , discussion in bernoff 1994 ) .",

    ". therefore , we examine all types of possibly growing perturbations .",
    "it is shown in appendix b that in order to study stability of rolls with respect to perturbations from the subspace constructed above , it suffices to check , whether ( for a given @xmath6 , @xmath40 and @xmath100 ) there exist such @xmath43 and @xmath44 that the following inequalities are satisfied : @xmath101 or @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the sum of the three second order minors .",
