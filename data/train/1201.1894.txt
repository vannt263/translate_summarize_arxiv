    "at least part of this dust could be associated with the molecular cloud that appears to be interacting with w41 @xcite , in agreement with the very large absorption column that we find in our spectral analysis ( see table 2 ) .",

    "we should note that it would be very difficult to obtain such a high pulsed fraction even for a very small hot spot emitting ( nearly isotropic ) bb radiation because the pulsations would be washed out by the light bending in the neutron star gravitational field ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if , however , we take into account that the angular distribution of radiation from a neutron star atmosphere has a narrow peak along the magnetic field direction @xcite , such a high pulsed fraction can indeed be explained assuming that the observed radiation emerges from a small hot spot near the magnetic pole of the neutron star .",
    "the fact that the light curve with such a high pulsed fraction shows only one peak per period suggests that the magnetic field configuration is substantially different from a centered dipole ( e.g. , it could be a strongly decentered dipole , in which case the magnetic fields and the temperatures are substantially different at the two poles ) .",
    "we caution here that the bb model provides only an empirical description of the spectral shape .",
    "it can be used for comparison of different sources , but it may be significantly different from the actual spectrum emitted from a neutron star atmosphere @xcite and possibly modified by the resonance compton scattering in the neutron star magnetosphere @xcite . comparing the bb fit parameters of the three sgrs ( j1834.9@xmath80846 , j1833@xmath80832 , and j0418@xmath1305729 ) , we can conclude that they do not depend on the sgr period ( in the range of 210s ) , nor on the strength of the spin - down magnetic field ( in the range of ( 0.1@xmath131 g ) .",
    "the nondetection of the in the pre - outburst data shows that the sgr flux can vary by at least a factor of @xmath132 between the presumably truly quiescent level in the low state and an elevated level that has persisted , with a slow decay , for at least 6 weeks after the outburst .",
    "this suggests that there is a large number of sgrs in a quiescent state undetectable at the current level of sensitivity of x - ray observatories .      at first glance",
    ", the extended emission around , detected by _ cxo _ in 2011 , looks rather unusual .",
    "its radial distribution is consistent with that of a dust scattering halo ( see figure [ fig : simulation ] ) , but its spectrum shows some peculiarities . in particular , the best - fit hydrogen column density of the halo is a factor of 2 lower than that of the central source , while their spectral slopes are similar within statistics , instead of being steeper by @xmath1332 , as expected for the model halo spectrum ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "a likely explanation can be derived from the breadth of the @xmath88@xmath94 confidence contours and the strong correlation of these parameters .",
    "indeed , figure [ fig : contours ] shows that an intermediate @xmath134@xmath78 corresponds to the 90% point source and halo confidence contours , and the best - fit photon indices at such @xmath88 are @xmath135 and @xmath136 for the point source and halo , respectively .",
    "thus , we believe that the dust scattering halo is the most plausible interpretation of the extended emission around .",
    "we should also note that a fainter extended emission was seen around the magnetar positition in the archival data from 2009 , in which no point source was detected .",
    "although the best - fit @xmath88 and @xmath94 for this pre - outburst emission are substantially smaller than those in the post - outburst data ( see table [ tab : cxofits ] ) , the large uncertainties of these parameters make them consistent with the corresponding parameters measured for the halo in 2011 .",
    "the existence of a halo in the archival data may indicate that experienced an outburst not long before the 2009 june 7 observation .",
    "although it seems certain that most of the extended emission is the dust - scattered emission from the magnetar , we can not exclude the possibility that it may contain some kind of a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) , due to synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons / positrons accelerated in the neutron star magnetosphere and shocked in the ambient medium .",
    "we know that in the case of rotation - powered pulsars , a typical x - ray pwn luminosity is about @xmath137 , albeit with a large scatter @xcite .",
    "if the same relationship is valid for magnetars , we would expect @xmath138erg  s@xmath2 , which would be undectable at the presumed distance of 4kpc .",
    "it might happen , however , that a `` magnetar wind nebula '' is more efficient than one created by a rotation - powered pulsar , in which case we would expect a detectable contribution . to separate it from the dust scattering halo , one should analyze several data sets obtained at different times after the outburst .",
    "we expect that the halo component flux would be changing in proportion to the point source flux ( with a time lag ) , while the pwn component would remain constant .",
    "the distance to still remains an open issue . as this source",
    "is located within w41 , association with this snr is certainly plausible ( other sgrs were found near snr centers , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it has not been firmly proven . similar extreme absorption ( @xmath139@xmath78 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has been measured for the neighboring cxou  j183434.9@xmath8084443 , indicating that such an absorption is not a unique feature of and hence not intrinsic to it .",
    "however , the distance to ( and the origin of ) cxou  j183434.9@xmath8084443 are also unknown .",
    "it could be a pulsar associated with w41 or a background agn located much farther .",
    "@xcite presented evidence for molecular clouds near w41 , which are likely interacting with the snr .",
    "the large absorbing column could be attributed to those clouds . at this point",
    "we can only conclude with certainty that is at the distance of 4kpc or farther ( the line of sight in that direction intersects several spiral arms ) . to better constrain the distance , the method of @xcite",
    "could be used ; however , it requires grating observations , which are only feasible when the source is in the bright state .",
    "we note , however , that the conclusion by @xcite , that all axps have more or less standard luminosity of @xmath140erg  s@xmath2 , can not hold for quiescent sgrs because otherwise they would have been easily seen even at the most extreme distance of 20kpc .",
    "the field surrounding is rich with high - energy sources ( see figure [ fig : img : multiwave ] ) .",
    "this magnetar is located at the heart of snrw41 and nearly at the center of the extended tev source hessj1834@xmath8087 , which itself is confined to the snr interior ( see figure [ fig : img : multiwave ] ) .",
    "in addition , there is a somewhat offset _ fermi _ source , 2fglj1834.3@xmath80848 , located nearby ( see figure [ fig : img : multiwave ] ) .",
    "since the extent of hessj1834@xmath8087 is significantly smaller than that of the snr , the tev emission can not be coming from the snr shell as it does in some other cases @xcite .",
    "the only other plausible explanation is that the tev emission is powered by relativistic electrons injected by the compact object formed after the snr explosion .",
    "there are currently several candidates for such an object .",
    "firstly , a few sgrs are known to be associated with shell - type snrs @xcite , and the central location of certainly supports such a hypothesis . on the other hand",
    ", there is no firm evidence so far that sgrs can produce copious amounts of relativistic particles similar to young rotation - powered pulsars .",
    "while there is a convincing evidence that pulsars can power relic pwne emitting tev @xmath6-rays , such evidence is currently lacking for magnetars .    among other sources possibly related to hessj1834@xmath8087 and w41 are cxou j@xmath141 ( a pwn candidate discussed in detail by * ? ? ? * ) and the 2xmm j183417.2@xmath8084901 , which is located right at the center of the _ fermi _ error circle ( see figure  [ fig : img : acis : xmm : swift ] , top panels ) .",
