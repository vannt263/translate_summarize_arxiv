    "the treatment of time in quantum mechanics is one of the challenging open questions in the foundations of quantum theory .",
    "on the one hand , time is the parameter entering schrdinger s equation and measured by an external laboratory clock .",
    "but time also plays the role of an _",
    "observable _ in questions involving the occurrence of an event ( e.g. when a nucleon decays , or when a particle emerges from a potential barrier ) , and  like every observable  should be represented in the theory by an operator whose properties are predictors of the outcome of [ event ] time measurements made on physical systems . yet no time",
    "operators occur in ordinary quantum mechanics . at its core , this is the _ quantum time problem_. as further testimony to this conundrum , the uncertainty principle for time / energy is known to have a different character than does the uncertainty principle for space / momentum .",
    "an important landmark in the historical development of the subject is an early ` theorem ' due to pauli @xcite .",
    "pauli s argument essentially precludes the existence of a self - adjoint time operator for systems where the spectrum of the hamiltonian is bounded , semi - bounded , or discrete , i.e. , for most systems of physical interest .",
    "pauli concluded that ",
    "the introduction of an operator @xmath0 [ time operator ] must fundamentally be abandoned  .",
    "while counterexamples to pauli s theorem are known , his assertion remains largely unquestioned and continues to be a major influence shaping much of the present work in this area . for a comprehensive , up - to - date review of this and related topics ,",
    "see @xcite,@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we advocate a different approach , one that emphasizes the statistical distribution of event times  not the time operator  as the primary construct .",
    "essentially , we follow the program that regards time as a povm ( positive , operator - valued measure ) observable @xcite .",
    "event time distributions are calculated in the usual way from wave functions in the time basis .",
    "we show that this time basis exists even for the semi - bounded and discrete hamiltonian systems ruled out by pauli s theorem , and is adequate for the representation of any physical state .",
    "however , the step from a time basis to a valid time operator requires additional assumptions that are not always met .",
    "still , this approach illuminates the crucial issue surrounding the construction of time operators and , at the same time ( no pun intended ) , establishes the time basis as a legitimate alternative to the familiar coordinate and momentum bases of standard quantum theory .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the time basis and establish the essential properties of its elements ( the time states ) for virtually any physical system .",
    "iii explores the relationship between time states and time operators , and establishes existence criteria for the latter . in secs .",
    "iv and v we show how some familiar results for specific systems can be recovered from the general theory advanced here , and in sec .",
    "vi we obtain new results applicable to the free particle in a three - dimensional space .",
    "results and conclusions are reported in sec .",
    "throughout we adopt natural units in which @xmath1 , a choice that leads to improved transparency by simplifing numerous expressions .",
    "we introduce basis states in the hilbert space @xmath2 labeled by a real variable @xmath3 that we will call _ system time_. for a quantum system described by the hamiltonian operator @xmath4 , these states are defined by the requirement that @xmath4 be the generator of translations among them . in particular , for any system time @xmath3 and every real number @xmath5  we require@xmath6 since @xmath4 is assumed to be hermitian , the transformation from @xmath2 to @xmath7 will be unitary ( and therefore norm - preserving ) . eq.([basis property ] ) shows that if @xmath2 is a member of this set then so too is @xmath8 , implying that system time @xmath3 extends continuously from the remote ` past ' ( @xmath9 ) to the distant ` future ' ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "we refer to the set @xmath11 as a _ timeline _ or _",
    "quantum history_.    eq.([basis property ] ) is reminiscent of the propagation of quantum states , which evolve according to @xmath12 .",
    "it follows that the dynamical wave function in the time basis , @xmath13 , obeys@xmath14 a property known in the quantum - time literature as _ covariance_. to appreciate its significance , recall that @xmath15  is essentially the probability that a given [ system ] time @xmath3 will be associated with some measurement after a [ laboratory ] time @xmath16 has passed ; covariance ensures that the same probability will be obtained for the initial state at the earlier [ system ] time @xmath17 .",
    "this is time - translation invariance , widely recognized as an essential feature that must be reproduced by any statistical distribution of time observables @xcite .",
    "we advance the conjecture that _ a quantum history exists for every system , with elements ( the time states ) sufficiently numerous to span the hilbert space of physical states_. the completeness of this basis is expressed in the abstract by the following resolution of the identity:@xmath18  and @xmath19 , we must be able to write@xmath20 the time states also are orthogonal , at least in a ` weak ' sense consistent with closure .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath19 in eq.([closure - l2 ] ) can be replaced by a time state , we get@xmath21 eq.([weak - orthogonality ] ) expresses quantitatively the notion of ` weak ' orthogonality ; it differs from standard usage ( ` strong ' orthogonality ) by uniquely specifying the domain of integration and restricting @xmath22 to be a normalizable state . but",
    "owing to the continuous nature of time , the time states @xmath23 are _ not _ normalizable , so eq.([closure - l2 ] ) can be satisfied even when eq.([weak - orthogonality ] ) is not .",
    "it follows that ` weak ' orthogonality is a stronger condition than closure , and subject to separate verification .",
    "quantum histories are intimately related to spectral structure , and derivable from it .",
    "indeed , we regard as axiomatic the premise that the eigenstates of @xmath4 , say @xmath24 , also span the space of physically realizable states to form the _ spectral basis _ @xmath25 . since @xmath4 is by assumption hermitian , the elements of the spectral basis can always be made mutually orthogonal ( in the ` strong ' sense ) , and normalized so as to satisfy a closure rule akin to eq.([closure rule ] ) .",
    "now eq.([basis property ] ) dictates that the timeline  spectral transformation is characterized by functions @xmath26 such that @xmath27 ; equivalently ( with @xmath28),@xmath29 this form is imposed by covariance .",
    "the constant on the right , while unspecified , is manifestly independent of @xmath3 .",
    "this enables us to write@xmath30 the sum in this equation is symbolic , translating into an ordinary sum over any discrete levels together with an integral over the continuum .",
    "_ a timeline exists if for every physical state _",
    "@xmath31 _ the transform of eq.([history - general ] ) maps the set _",
    "@xmath32 _ into a square - integrable function _",
    "@xmath33 on @xmath34 .",
    "the remainder of this section is devoted to confirming the existence of these timelines and verifying their essential properties ( covariance , completeness , ` weak ' orthogonality ) for a wide variety of spectra .",
    "more generally , we contend that timelines _ always _ can be constructed with the properties expressed by eqs.([basis property ] ) and ( [ closure rule ] ) above . in this sense",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath4 can be said to define its own time  an intrinsic [ system ] time @xmath3  that is quite distinct from the laboratory time @xmath16 appearing in the schrdinger equation .",
    "we consider here spectra consisting exclusively of discrete , non - degenerate levels .",
    "the spacing between adjacent levels might be arbitrarily small ( approximating a continuum ) , but all level separations are assumed to be non - zero .",
    "the levels are therefore countable ; we ascribe to them energies @xmath35 ordered by increasing energy , and label as @xmath36 the state with energy @xmath37 .",
    "consistent with a hamiltonian operator that is hermitian , we will take these states to be mutually orthogonal and normalized ( to unity ) .",
    "generally , there will be an infinite number of such states that together span the hilbert space of physical states .",
    "in the _ accessible states model _ the first @xmath38 of these states are deemed sufficient to represent a given physical system subject to the available interactions . by increasing their number",
    ", we eventually include all states that are accessible from one another by some series of physical interactions . in this way we are left at every stage with a _",
    "finite _ [ @xmath38-dimensional ] hilbert space spanned by a spectral basis whose",
    "elements are orthonormal .",
    "admittedly , @xmath38 can be very large and is somewhat ill - defined ; in consequence , results  to be useful  will have to be reported in a way that makes clear how we transition to the @xmath39 limit .",
    "lastly , for every @xmath38 we assume the existence of a _ recurrence time _ , a reference to the smallest duration over which an arbitrary initial state regains its initial form .",
    "recurrence has implications for spectral structure , without being unduly restrictive .",
    "indeed , we believe the model just outlined can serve as a basic template for any realistic spectrum .",
    "our approach is essentially that taken by pegg @xcite in his search for an operator conjugate to the hamiltonian of periodic systems .",
    "what follows amounts to a restatement of those basic results and their extension to aperiodic systems , where the recurrence time becomes arbitrarily large .    in keeping with eq.([timeline - spectral link ] )",
    ", the spectral - time transformation in the accessible states model is specified by the functions@xmath40 the coefficients @xmath41  are chosen to ensure closure of the resulting time states ; in turn , this requires for all @xmath42@xmath43 i.e. , the functions @xmath44 must constitute an orthogonal set over the domain of the time label @xmath3 .",
    "this domain derives from the recurrence time ( also known as the _ revival time _ ) denoted here by @xmath45 , a reference to the smallest duration over which an arbitrary initial state @xmath31 regains its initial form , up to an overall [ physically insignificant ] phase .",
    "since state evolution is governed by the system hamiltonian , recurrence has consequences for the energy spectrum : specifically , a revival time implies the existence of a smallest integer @xmath46 for every energy level @xmath37 such that@xmath47 to take a familiar example , let s assume the level distribution is uniform with spacing @xmath48 , so that @xmath49 ( uniform level spacing is the hallmark of the harmonic oscillator ) . for this case @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and",
    "the recurrence time is just @xmath52 .",
    "another well - known example is the infinite square well , for which @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the energy of the ground state .",
    "in this instance we have @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and a recurrence time @xmath57 .",
    "one consequence of eq.([revivals ] ) is that the energy spectrum is commensurate , meaning that the ratio of any two levels  after adjusting for a possible global offset  is a rational number .",
    "that commensurability is a necessary but not sufficient condition for recurrence is illustrated by the discrete spectrum of hydrogen : @xmath58 with @xmath59 the ground state energy .",
    "here commensurability is evident ( with zero offset ) , but there is no [ finite ] revival time unless the spectrum is truncated , say at @xmath60 .",
    "this recurrence time clearly grows with increasing @xmath38 ( the largest period is @xmath61 ) , and becomes infinite when all levels are included .    with a revival time",
    "we should be able to limit the domain of @xmath3 to a single recurrence cycle ; indeed , a straightforward calculation with the help of eq.([revivals ] ) reveals that the functions @xmath62 are in fact orthogonal over any one cycle , thereby rendering the spectral  time transformation essentially a fourier series .",
    "in fact , with the understanding that @xmath63 is zero unless @xmath64 is a member of the set @xmath65 defined by eq.([revivals ] ) , eq.([history - general ] ) can be recast as@xmath66 but for the multiplicative phase factor , this _ is _ a fourier series for functions that are periodic with period @xmath45 .    at this point",
    "we could simply invoke a general result of fourier analysis  to argue that the above series converges [ in the norm ] to define a viable timeline function @xmath33 for any normalizable state @xmath31 .",
    "however , it is far more illuminating to investigate in some detail how this actually comes about . to that end",
    ", we begin with an important observation reinforced by our earlier example of the discrete hydrogen spectrum : _ for a system with a finite number of energy levels  no matter how large  a revival time always exists in practice_. to see this , consider the @xmath67 ` gaps ' @xmath68 separating adjacent discrete levels , and denote the smallest of these by @xmath69 .",
    "if the gap ratio @xmath70 is a rational number , say @xmath71 , then a revival time exists and is given by @xmath72 .",
    "since any irrational number can be approximated to arbitrary precision by a rational one , a revival time ` almost ' always exists ( though it may far exceed the natural period @xmath73 associated with any one energy ) .    with @xmath38 orthogonal stationary states",
    "there can be no more than an identical number of linearly independent time states , i.e. , the time basis latexmath:[$\\left\\ {    be vastly _ overcomplete_.",
    "this suggests that closure might be achieved with just @xmath38 discrete time states , properly chosen . to verify this ,",
    "we select from the time domain @xmath75   $ ] a uniform mesh of @xmath38 points @xmath76 and evaluate@xmath77\\ ] ] each term in the sum on the right can be represented by a unit - amplitude phasor .",
    "the phasor sum is obtained by adding successive phasors tail - to - tip , resulting in an @xmath38-sided regular convex polygon with each exterior angle ( angle between successive phasors ) equal to @xmath78 .",
    "but since @xmath79 , the cumulative exterior angle is always an integer multiple of @xmath80 ( @xmath81 from eq.([revivals ] ) ) , implying that said polygon invariably is _",
    "closed_. thus the sum vanishes for all @xmath82 .",
    "( for @xmath83 the value is simply @xmath38 , the number of terms in the sum . ) since @xmath36 and @xmath84 refer to any pair of stationary states ( and these are complete by hypothesis ) ,  the preceding results imply the operator equivalence @xmath85  it follows that these @xmath38 consecutive time states by themselves span this @xmath38-dimensional space provided @xmath86 for every @xmath87 ( the only vector orthogonal to all is the null element ) .",
    "closure equivalence with the spectral basis further requires all coefficients @xmath41 to have unit magnitude ; since any phase can be absorbed into the stationary state @xmath36 , we will simply take @xmath88 .",
    "the time basis @xmath89 has discrete elements , yet @xmath3 supposedly is a continuous variable .",
    "we resolve this apparent contradiction by noting that the argument leading to this discrete time basis is unaffected if @xmath38 is scaled by any integer and @xmath90 is reduced by the same factor ( leaving @xmath79 unchanged ) .",
    "thus , every set of time states@xmath91 is complete in this @xmath38-dimensional space , but all except the primitive one ( @xmath92 ) is _ _ over__complete . nonetheless , this observation allows us to write@xmath93 ( passage to the continuum limit presumes that @xmath3 has no granularity , even on the smallest scale . ) scaling the time states by @xmath94 then results in an indenumerable time basis that enjoys closure equivalence with the spectral basis in this @xmath38-dimensional space .",
    "explicitly , the squared norm of any element @xmath31 can be expressed as@xmath95",
    "with@xmath96    while it could be argued that @xmath38 always has an upper bound in practice , it is typically quite large and known only imprecisely .",
    "convergence of these results as @xmath39 therefore is crucial to a viable theory of timelines .",
    "now for every @xmath38 no matter how large , eq.([closure - discrete ] ) establishes closure equivalence of the time basis with the spectral basis , and leads directly to the _ plancherel identity _",
    "@xcite expressed by eq.([closure equivalence ] ) .",
    "but by definition , the norm of a normalizable state remains finite even in the limit @xmath39 , so the plancherel identity ensures the existence of the square - integrable function @xmath33 on @xmath97   $ ] in this same limit .",
    "we conclude that eq.([history - discrete ] ) maps the spectral components @xmath98 into square - integrable functions @xmath99 in the time basis , as required for a timeline .",
    "this establishes convergence [ in the norm ] for the timeline wave function @xmath33 .",
    "our final task is to write the transformation law of eq.([history - discrete ] ) in a form that is useful for calculation in the large @xmath38 limit .",
    "the way we proceed depends on how the recurrence time varies with @xmath38 . as more states",
    "are included in the model , all levels might remain isolated no matter how numerous they become ( @xmath45 saturates at a finite value ) ; alternatively , some levels may cluster to form a quasi - continuum ( @xmath100 ) , merging into a true continuum as @xmath39 .",
    "anticipating a mix of the two , we write the quasi - continuum contributions to @xmath33 in terms of the characteristic energy @xmath101 associated with the recurrence time @xmath45:@xmath102   \\delta e\\ ] ] the significance of the bracketed term can be appreciated by comparing discrete and continuum contributions to the squared norm of the state @xmath31:@xmath103 the replacement@xmath104 amounts to a renormalization of the quasi - continuum wave function  known as _ energy normalization _",
    "@xcite  such that the [ energy- ] integrated density of the new function carries the same weight as does an isolated state .",
    "replacing sums over the quasi - continuum with integrals becomes exact in the large @xmath38 limit ( with the inclusion of additional levels , @xmath100 and @xmath105 ) . in this way",
    ", we arrive at a form of the transformation law that lends itself to computation as @xmath39:@xmath106 eq.([history - mixed ] )  assumes that all discrete stationary states are normalized to unity ( @xmath107 ) , and all [ quasi-]continuum elements are energy - normalized ( @xmath108 ) .",
    "notice that the continuum contribution references @xmath38 only indirectly through the spectral bounds @xmath109 , @xmath110 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , whenever a continuum is present ( aperiodic systems , for which @xmath100 ) , it makes the dominant contribution to @xmath33 for any fixed value of @xmath3 . to be fair",
    ", there is one limitation : @xmath3 can not be so large that @xmath111 varies appreciably over the step size @xmath112 ; this means the integral approximation to the quasi - continuum fails for @xmath113 . in a similar vein , the discrete terms can never simply be dropped from eq.([history - mixed ] ) , as they make the largest contribution to @xmath33 in the asymptotic regime .",
    "although complete , the time basis typically includes non - orthogonal elements . in the absence of a continuum , and with uniform level spacing for the discrete terms , it is not difficult to show that the minimal time basis is composed of @xmath38 _ mutually orthogonal _ states .",
    "but otherwise the existence of even one orthogonal pair is not guaranteed . by contrast , ` weak ' orthogonality is the rule in this @xmath38-dimensional space .",
    "this can be verified rigorously by using closure of the [ discrete ] time basis in eq.([basis - discrete ] ) to write@xmath114 scaling the time states by @xmath94 and passing to the continuum limit then gives@xmath115 with @xmath33  again calculated from eq.([history - mixed ] ) .",
    "since @xmath38 is not referenced explicitly here , we conclude from eq.([weak - ortho - discrete ] ) that ` weak ' orthogonality persists in the limit as @xmath39 at every value @xmath3 where the timeline wave function @xmath33 converges .",
    "degenerate states require labels in addition to the energy to distinguish them .",
    "these extra labels derive from the underlying symmetry that is the root of all degeneracy .",
    "thus , a central potential gives rise to a rotationally - invariant hamiltonian and this , in turn , implies that the hamiltonian operator commutes with angular momentum ( the generator of rotations ) .",
    "in such cases , the energy label is supplemented with orbital and magnetic quantum numbers specifying the particle angular momentum .",
    "the larger point is simply this : with the additional labels comes again an unambiguous identification of the spectral states , and we write @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is a collective label that symbolizes _ all _ additional quantum numbers needed to identify the spectral basis element with a given energy . with this simple modification ,",
    "the arguments of the preceding section remain intact .",
    "quantum histories can be constructed as before , but now are indexed by the same ` good ' quantum numbers that characterize the spectrum .",
    "that is , in the face of degeneracy we have not one  but multiple  timelines , and we write @xmath118 .",
    "notice that any two time states belonging to _ distinct _ timelines will be orthogonal ( in the ` strong ' sense)@xmath119 and  of course  _ all _ timelines must be included to span the entire hilbert space , so that eq.([closure rule ] ) becomes@xmath120 where @xmath121 are elements of the _ same _ unitary matrix that characterizes the subspace ` rotation ' ( cf .",
    "eq.([history - general ] ) ) .",
    "furthermore , unitarity ensures that the projector onto every degenerate subspace is representation - independent:@xmath122 as we shall soon see , eq.([subspace - projector ] ) has important ramifications for the statistics of [ event ] time observables whenever degeneracy is present .    one final observation : degenerate or not , the timelines of eq.([history - mixed ] ) are _ not _ unique , inasmuch as they can be altered by an ( energy - dependent ) phase adjustment to the eigenstates of @xmath4 .",
    "consider the replacement @xmath123 . if @xmath124 is proportional to @xmath125 ,",
    "say @xmath126 , then @xmath127 , i.e. , a linear ( with energy ) phase adjustment to the stationary states shifts the origin of system time , underscoring the notion that only _ durations _ in system time can have measureable consequences .",
    "other , more complicated phase adjustment schemes can be contemplated , with the time states always related by a suitable unitary transformation . some of these have clear physical significance , as later examples will show .",

    "the issue assumes greater importance if @xmath45 becomes arbitrarily large ( aperiodic systems ) ; we will return to this point later .    because time states are generally non - orthogonal and overcomplete ,",
    "the significance of this time operator is not clear .",
    "indeed , the states @xmath2 can not be eigenstates of the operator @xmath0 , which is hermitian ( as evidenced by its matrix elements in the spectral basis ) . nonetheless , the time basis constitutes a resolution of the identity , so the timeline wave function may admit a probability interpretation along conventional lines . for any state @xmath31 ( cf .",
