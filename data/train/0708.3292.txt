    "the flavor physics and cp violation , which is the main theme of b physics , has been also investigated in k physics for a long time .",
    "the first discoveries of particle - antiparticle ( @xmath5-@xmath6 ) mixing and cp violation are examples of its achievements .",
    "since k contains s - quark , the k - physics is complementary with the b - physics which studies the transitions from b - quark .    in an experimental viewpoint , most of k experiments",
    "have been performed as fix - target experiments in contrast with the fact of mostly collider experiments in the case of b. they can collect a large amount of decays to make highly precise measurements , or to attack very rare modes .",
    "the biannual international meeting of k - physics , kaon07 , will be held at frascatti next week . here , several recent topics are picked up from the kaon07 program : @xmath7 measurements , check of @xmath1-e universality through @xmath8 decays , new cp - violation searches through the charge asymmetry in @xmath9 decay and muon transverse polarization in @xmath10 decay and @xmath11 experiments using @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "for other topics and more detail information about recent k - physics , please visit the web site of kaon07 .",
    "@xmath7 , @xmath13 , is a critical ingredient in a determination of the other ckm parameters as seen in the wolfenstein parameterization below .",
    "the precise determination of @xmath12 is also critical to check the untarity of the ckm matrix using its first row . in the review of pdg-2004",
    "there was a hint of deviation from unitarity by 2.2@xmath14 as shown in eq .",
    "[ eq - unitality1 ]    @xmath15    the blanching ratios of all @xmath16 decays together with their form factors for @xmath4 and @xmath3 were re - measured by ktev , kloe , na48 and istra .",
    "the life time of @xmath4 and branching ratios of @xmath17 of @xmath18 and @xmath19 were also re - measured by kloe .",
    "meanwhile , most of branching ratios of k decays have been revised and significantly changed from the previous values .",
    "figure  [ figure1 ] shows @xmath4 branching ratios as an example",
    ".     decays .",
    "the vertical lines indicate the @xmath20 bounds from a fit to all ktev , kloe and na48 measurements . figures were copied from ref@xcite , width=302 ]    one of reasons of the changes was suggested by ktev as it was caused with a previous inadequate treatment of inner bremsstrahlung .",
    "now , @xmath12 is determined with an accuracy of less than 1 % .",
    "the @xmath21 , which is a unique counterpart for the unitarity check because of the smallness of @xmath22 , has been determined with an improved accuracy by a factor of 2 through a global study of nine super - allowed beta - decays and a refined radiative correction .",
    "then , the unitarity becomes as shown in eq .",
    "[ eq - unitality2 ] .",
    "@xcite @xmath23    although the unitarity is recovered with a slightly better accuracy , the precision of @xmath12 determination is worse than that of @xmath21 .",
    "it is certain that the more improvement of @xmath12 determination is required in order to check the unitarity the more critically .",
    "one of important aspects , which should be stressed , is an influence or a stimulation to other measurements and related physics by the recent efforts to improve @xmath12 and @xmath21 determinations .",
    "the ratio of @xmath24-decays into hadrons with those into leptons turns to be a channel to determine the mass of s - quark using the improved @xmath12 .",
    "measurements of neutron life time and @xmath25 , which must be the best for @xmath21 determination later and which closely relate to nucleo - synthesis scenario , are also being stimulated .",
    "the recent works have been achieved by various theoretical studies as well as the experimental efforts , but there still remains further theoretical studies , such as the improvements of estimation of @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "they are the parameters bringing the largest ambiguity to the determinations @xmath12 from @xmath16 and @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the studies are valuable not only for the next @xmath12 determination but also for a development of the method to be applied to other physics .",
    "among various checks of the @xmath1-e universality , the ratio of br(@xmath28)/br(@xmath29 ) ( denote it @xmath30 ) has an advantage .",
    "most of theoretical ambiguities in each individual decay , for example the decay constant @xmath26 , are cancelled by taking ratio .",
    "the standard model predicts the ratio to be @xmath31 .",
    "the ambiguity is only 0.04 % . on the other hand ,",
    "the experimental upper bound is @xmath32 , the error of which is about 4 % .",
    "there is enough room to look for new physics .",
    "recently , we have heard interesting progresses in both theory and experiment .    a recent calculation based on susy with lepton flavor violation mechanism by masiero _",
    "_ @xcite predicts that the effect can be as high as 2 % , which is almost near to the experimental limit . in the model , right - handed neutrino , which is a major object in the present particle physics , plays a crucial role .    on the experimental side @xcite two runs of na48 - 2 and kloe recently improved the accuracy by a factor of 2 individually and the combined error reached 1.3 % .",
    "moreover , the na48 collaboration announced that they have a chance of new measurement using the beam from this july during the test run for their next plan of @xmath33 measurement ( p326 , na48 - 3 ) .",
    "they claimed that their major systematic error in na48 - 2 was background contamination to @xmath34 by @xmath35 and that it can be controlled in the new measurement .",
    "the goal of the new measurement is @xmath36 .    on the other hand ,",
    "the error of @xmath37 was also reduced from @xmath38 to @xmath39 using many data for @xmath12 measurements . however , the theoretical ambiguity , mostly from form factor difference of @xmath17 and @xmath10 , is dominant .",
    "another check of @xmath1-e universality using pion decay , pienu at triumf , plans to improve the ratio of br(@xmath40)/br(@xmath41 ) by a factor of 5 .",
    "the charge asymmetry in @xmath9 decays , a@xmath42 , is suppressed to be around @xmath43 in the standard ckm model and the previous limit of experiment was an order of @xmath44 .",
    "na48 - 2 measured the charge asymmetry for @xmath45 ( a@xmath46 ) and that for @xmath47 ( a@xmath48 ) in order to look for a new cp - violation source .",
    "@xcite using hundreds million samples of both decays , they obtained the results as a@xmath49 and a@xmath50 .",
    "the values are consistent with zero , and they could set new upper bounds , which were one - order - of - magnitude below the previous ones . although some room of another one - order remains down to the standard model prediction , it may be said that the accuracy reached to the level that no one wants to re - measure in near future .",
    "it was one of the best measurements in k , in which systematic errors were well controlled .",
    "another search of a new cp - violation source is the transverse muon polarization ( @xmath51 ) in @xmath52 decay as shown in figure  [ figure2 ]",
    ".     decay .",
    "@xmath51 is defined as @xmath53,width=226 ]    non - zero @xmath51 is a signature of t - violation , which corresponds to cp - violation under cpt theorem .",
    "the standard ckm model predicts @xmath51 to be less than @xmath54 , but a spurious t - odd effect due to final state interactions is expected to appear at @xmath55 , which determines the limit of search .",
    "recently , e246 collaboration at kek reported their final results.@xcite they well controlled most of sources of systematic error by using stopped @xmath3 , a 12-gap toroidal spectrometer and symmetrically arranged @xmath56 detectors .",
    "the result was @xmath57 .",
    "it was consistent with zero and they set an upper bound of @xmath58 .",
    "the group is proposing a new experiment ( trek ) at j - parc to go down to @xmath59 .",
    "they clain that the largest systematic error , which came from an ambiguity of magnetic field at the muon stoppers ( @xmath1sr position ) , will be reduced by replacing the stopper from aluminum plates to active ones .",
    "the collaboration will re - use most of the e246 detectors with small modifications .",
    "the proposal passed the first step examination .",
    "the @xmath11 decay has been considered as a golden - plated channel in k - decays and now there are three plans ; p326 ( na48 - 3 ) at cern - sps for the charged mode @xmath60 , and klod at serpkov - u70 and e14 at jparc - ps for the neutral mode @xmath61 .",
    "p326 and e14 are taking a similar strategy of step - by - step approach to reach an observation of 100-events ( for the standard model predictions ) .    in the standard model",
    "the @xmath60 decay contains information of @xmath62 with adding a small charm - quark contribution , and the @xmath61 decay does im@xmath63 . the branching ratios , which are predicted by the standard model using the ckm parameters determined by b - decays , are @xmath64 for @xmath3 and @xmath65 for @xmath4 .",
    "it is quite interesting that the errors already reached @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "so , we may say that the main goal of the experiments is not additional measurements of @xmath62 or im@xmath63 . it is a search of a deviation due to new physics as shown in figure  [ figure4 ] .",
    "the @xmath11 decay has remarkable merits in the search .",
    "the decay proceeds through purely electro - weak fcnc ( flavor changing neutral current ) and the theoretical ambiguity is very small .",
    "it is a few @xmath68 .",
    "for example , a measurement of the @xmath61 decay at a sensitivity of @xmath69 corresponds to the observation of 100 sm - events and corresponds to an observation of a @xmath70 effect for the new physics , which enhances the branching ratio by a factor of 1.75 .",
    "the 1.75 enhancement can be brought by physics of 100 tev mass scale in a simple tree diagram model . in the case of @xmath71 and @xmath72 , which are considered as golden plated channels in new - physics searches in b - physics at lhc",
    ", the 1.75 enhancement corresponding observations of 100 sm - events and @xmath70 effect can be brought by 10-tev scale in the similar model .",
    "such an example varies model - by - model , but it indicates that the measurement might be still important even in the era of lhc .      the basic method taken by p326 @xcite is a missing mass method by measuring the momenta of incident and secondary particles , which are @xmath3 and @xmath73 for the @xmath60 decay . the missing mass ( @xmath74 ) can be calculated from eq .",
    "[ pinunubar - mm ] .",

    "distribution , width=264 ]    the @xmath60 decay can be found in the two valleys under three bumps or peaks from decays of @xmath19 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the amount of events in each bump is expected to be @xmath79 times larger than that of @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , it is crucially important to measure both momenta as well as tracks to determine the vertex accurately as much as possible .",
    "in addition to the missing mass , they will install pid ( rich detector ) to reduce @xmath19 and photon veto system to reduce @xmath77 .",
    "still , the keenest element is the tracker for incident @xmath3 , which should be operated under a high beam - rate of 800 mhz .",
    "the estimated values of signal and background are listed in  table  [ table1 ] .",
    ".signal and background expected in p326 , the region 1 and 2 are the regions where @xmath74 stays in the valley below and above @xmath77 , respectively . [",

    "p326 is a successor of na48 , as sometimes called as na48 - 3",
    ". they will be able to re - use major parts of na48 setup as well as their rich experience .",
    "the collaboration is waiting for a financial support for the detector modification and they will start from a beam test run in this july as mentioned in the previous section .      in the neutral mode , there are no @xmath19 and @xmath77 branching ratio is smaller than that in the charged mode by three orders of magnitude .",
    "although they are great advantages , the @xmath80 decay has several disadvantages , such as relatively poor resolution for a clean separation of the regions of signal and background and no tracking devices of photons .",
    "then , all planned experiments use a very thin beam ( pencil beam ) to identify the @xmath80 decay with a missing transverse - momentum ( @xmath51 ) method .",
    "the energies and hit positions of two photons from @xmath56 are measured with calorimeter , the decay vertex ( @xmath81 ) is calculated with an assumption that the two - photons are created from @xmath56 on the beam axis , and @xmath51 is calculated by using the decay vertex .",
    "contaminations by other decays are reduced by veto cut .    for a further pursuit beyond the previous ktev trial",
    ", there were many technical problems such as construction of the pencil beam , a very high vacuum of @xmath43 pa to reduce @xmath56 productions in the decay region by beam - air interactions , very tight veto with a threshold down to 1 mev to reduce contaminations by @xmath77 , _ etc _ , and a fundamental question whether the method can work or not .",
    "e391a at kek - ps was planned and carried out to get answers to these problems and question by looking at a final plot in a high sensitivity .",

    "the main modifications are a replacement of the csi calorimeter into thick and finely - segmented one used in ktev , a change of readout electronics into wave - form digitizer and a replacement of the beam plug counter to the one , which has been designed for kopio .",
    "the collaboration estimated that the contaminations by halo beam interactions can be reduce to a negligible level , using less halo and better k / n at the new beam line in j - parc , optimizing the apertures and materials of collar counters , _",
