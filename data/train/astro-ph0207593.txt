    "the single - source spectrum of gravitational waves of a black hole - torus system is modeled by the emission of a fraction of about ten percent of the rotational energy of a rapidly spinning black hole @xcite .",
    "these emissions correspond to mass inhomogeneities in the torus on the order of a few permille of the black hole mass , which have recently been identified as papaloizou - pringle buckling modes @xcite .",

    "this signal is comprised of discrete pulses , originating largely from sources at redshifts of 13 .",
    "since these pulses last typically about 4080 s ( in our frame ) , they overlap and produce a near - continuous background , to within the approximations made in our treatment .",
    "a stochastic background will manifest itself in a single detector as excess noise .",

    "the most promising detection strategy is that of cross - correlation of the output of two neighboring detectors , as recently reviewed by allen & romano ( 1999 ) and maggiore ( 2000 ) . for the signals in them to be correlated ,",
    "the detectors must be separated by less than one reduced wavelength , which is about 100 km for frequencies around 500 hz where we expect the grb - generated background to peak .",
    "the detectors also need to be sufficiently well separated that their noise sources are largely uncorrelated .    under these conditions ,",

    "* eq .  3.75 ) : @xmath109 here , @xmath110 is an `` overlap reduction function '' , which accounts for the separation and relative orientation of the detectors , and @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the noise power spectral densities of the detectors .",
    "as the optimal filter depends on @xmath113 , a range of filter functions based on theoretical expectations of this function will need to be used .    for this preliminary study of the detectability of the grb - generated background ,",
    "we assume an optimized value of close to unity for @xmath110 of two detectors situated within several kilometres .",
    "we take the flat-@xmath12 @xmath113 as shown in fig .",
    "7 and use a piecewise parametrized model for @xmath111 and @xmath112 for proposed advanced ligo detectors ( flanagan & hughes 1998 ) , assuming a pair of similar detectors .",
    "10 plots the resulting @xmath107 as a function of integration time , yielding a value of about 8 for 1 yr of integration .",
    "this preliminary result suggests that the proposed grb gw background is potentially detectable given optimized cross - correlation between two advanced ligo detectors .",
    "we also note that given the uncertainty in the sign of @xmath5 in the single - source emission model , the peak flux may occur at higher frequencies . if so then the the grb gw background may be detectable using cross - correlation with a resonant - mass interferometer detector pair .",
    "the ligo - wa interferometer and allegro resonant - mass detector pair , when co - aligned , yield a value for @xmath114 close to unity across the bandwidth 11000 hz @xcite .",
    "unfortunately this bandwidth is not fully utilized in the ratio of gw power to noise power appearing in the integral in eq .",
    "( 14 ) , because allegro , as a resonant - mass detector , has a narrow bandwidth , centered on a resonant frequency of about 900 hz in this case .",
    "we draw several conclusions :    \\1 .",
    "black hole - torus systems associated with grbs are expected to give a substantial contribution to the stochastic gw background in a frequency window of 300 - 450 hz@xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes an uncertainty factor of order unity in the radius of the torus .",
    "if black hole - torus systems exist also as transient sources independent of grbs , their event rate will be higher with a commensurably more pronounced stochastic gw background .",
    "it is instructive to compare the presented results with radiation from rapidly rotating neutron stars .",
    "black hole - torus systems produce spectral flux densities which are similar to the contribution from r - mode instabilities as described in ferrari et al .",
    "( 1999b ) . here",
    ", the large output provided by the spin - energy of the black hole compensates for an event rate which is less than the formation rate of neutron stars by some three orders of magnitude .",
    "the frequencies and @xmath86 of the former are markedly higher , respectively , lower than those predicted for radiation from neutron star modes , however .",
    "the @xmath86 of the signals from neutron star r - modes may be as high as @xmath115 ( ferrari et al .",
    "1999b ) in contrast to our @xmath86 estimate of order unity for the signals from grb sources .",
    "this comparision becomes more favorable with recent understanding of r - modes in more detailed and realistic scenarios .",
    "the r - modes are driven by a generally weak gravitational radiation - reaction force and , in the perturbative limit , effectively decoupled from other modes @xcite .",
    "a recent appreciation of various channels for creating viscosity @xcite renders their saturation energies small , and less so than previously thought @xcite .",
    "the high output in gravitational radiation powered by the spin - energy of the black hole gives rise to a major contribution to the predicted gw background by a relatively nearby population of sources .",
    "this is apparent in the edge at 450 hz@xmath3 in fig .",
    "4 to the 300450 hz@xmath3 flat-@xmath12 spectral flux density plateau due to sources at higher redshifts .",
    "the comparable contributions by the nearby and distant sources is a robust result , depending only on the assumption that the proposed black hole - torus systems are tightly locked to the sfr .",
    "as the local grb rate ( assumed in this work ) is about 1 yr@xmath9 within a radius of 100 mpc , the average background spectral flux density should be representative of sources from @xmath94 0.025 for an observation time of one year .",
    "one can view the background spectral flux density shown in fig .",
    "4 as the result of averaging the flux from a discrete number distribution over an infinite observation time . we plan to investigate these issues further in connection with the detectability of this predicted background using advanced ligo - type detectors .",
    "the estimated frequency range of about 2002000 hz of the proposed background and foreground radiation in gravitational waves from black hole - torus systems in association with grbs defines a new source with a well - defined event rate in the high - frequency bandwidth of ligo / virgo detectors as well as for some of the current bar detectors .",
    "cross - correlating the output between pairs of detectors promises to be the optimum detection strategy . for an idealized advanced ligo pair of detectors ,",
    "the @xmath107 could be high enough for detection of the proposed background in a year of integration . using present detector technology and locations",
    ", the optimum detector pair combination may be a resonant - mass and interferometric detector , such as the ligo - wa and allegro pair .",
