    "the phenomena of neutrino oscillations have been established by the atmospheric , solar , accelerator and reactor neutrino experiments .",
    "this means the existence of three flavors of massive and mixing neutrinos which are beyond the standard model ( sm ) @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the cosmological observations stringently constrain the neutrino masses should be in the sub - ev region @xcite .",
    "currently the most popular scheme for the neutrino mass generation is the famous seesaw @xcite mechanism which can highly suppress the neutrino masses by a small ratio of the electroweak scale over a newly high scale .",
    "the seesaw scale can be lowed if we do some fine tuning on the related couplings . in the usual seesaw models , the lepton - number - violating interactions for",
    "the neutrino mass generation can also accommodate a leptogenesis @xcite mechanism to generate the baryon asymmetry in the universe . in this scenario",
    "the seesaw and the leptogenesis are realized at a same scale .    alternatively",
    ", some tev - scale fields can help us to obtain the small neutrino masses at loop level @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the neutrino masses may be suppressed by the charity besides the loop factors .",
    "for example , krauss , nasri and trodden ( knt ) ever proposed an interesting model with two tev - scale singly charged scalars and one majorana singlet fermion to give the neutrino masses at three - loop level @xcite .",
    "the majorana singlet fermion can keep stable to serve as a dark matter particle . in order to fulfill the neutrino oscillation data which require at least two nonzero neutrino mass eigenvalues , the knt model should contain two or more majorana singlet fermions @xcite .",
    "although the knt model has an advantage of testability at colliers , it can not explain the cosmic baryon asymmetry .",
    "in this work we will slightly extend the knt model by two real singlet scalars in order to demonstrate an interesting scenario that a high - scale leptogenesis can be consistent with a testable neutrino mass generation .",
    "specifically , the real singlet scalars are very heavy so that their decays can be responsible for the leptogenesis .",
    "meanwhile , we can obtain the knt model by integrating out these real singlet scalars .",
    "we denote the non - sm fields by @xmath1 & & \\sigma(1,1,0)(0)\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here and thereafter the first brackets following the fields describe the transformations under the @xmath2 gauge groups , while the second brackets are the lepton numbers .",
    "we assume the lepton number can be softly broken .",
    "furthermore , our model respects a @xmath0 discrete symmetry under which the fields transform as @xmath3 the @xmath0 symmetry will not be broken at any scales .",
    "this means the real singlet scalars @xmath4 will not be allowed to obtain any non - zero vacuum expectation values .    under the softly broken lepton number and the exactly conserved @xmath0 discrete symmetry",

    "( [ lag ] ) , are the unique source for the lepton number violation .",
    "in addition , the two parameters @xmath13 are always allowed to have a relative phase . as we will show",
    "later this phase provides the necessary cp violation for the leptogenesis .",
    "as shown in fig . [ numass ] , the non - sm scalars and fermions can mediate a three - loop diagram in association with the yukawa couplings for generating the sm lepton masses .",
    "clearly , after the electroweak symmetry breaking , this three - loop diagram will contribute a majorana mass term of the left - handed neutrinos .",
    "since the real singlet scalars @xmath4 are very heavy , they can be integrated out from eq .",
    "( [ lag ] ) .",
    "the resulting lagrangian then can contain a sizable quartic coupling between the singly charged scalars @xmath14 and @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath16 we hence obtain the knt model where the lightest one of the majorana fermions @xmath17 can be a stable dark matter particle . for simplicity",
    ", we will not repeat the details of the neutrino masses and the dark matter @xcite .",
    "fig . [ hsdecay ] shows the lepton - number - violating decays of the real singlet scalars @xmath18 as well as the lepton - number - conserving decays of the singly charged scalar pairs @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the real scalar decays can generate a lepton asymmetry stored in the charged scalars . through the charged scalar decays , the sm leptons",
    "then can acquire a lepton asymmetry , which participates in the sphaleron processes so that it can be partially converted to a baryon asymmetry .",
    "we calculate the width in the real scalar decays at tree level , @xmath21 and the cp asymmetry at one - loop order , @xmath22    as an example , we assume the real scalar @xmath23 much lighter than the other one @xmath24 . the final baryon asymmetry",
    "then should mainly come from the @xmath23 decays . for a numerical estimation , we define @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the hubble constant , @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the relativistic degrees of freedom during the leptogenesis epoch . in the strong washout region",
    "where @xmath29 the final baryon asymmetry can be simply described by @xcite @xmath30 here @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively , are the baryon number density and the entropy density , while the factor @xmath33 is the sphaleron lepton - to - baryon coefficient . after fixing @xmath34 ( the sm fields plus two singly charged scalars as well as two singlet fermions ) and inputting , @xmath35 we read @xmath36 the baryon asymmetry",
    "then can arrive at an expected value , @xmath37    ones may worry about the produced lepton asymmetry will be erased by some lepton - number - violating processes at low energies since fig .",
    "[ numass ] actually results in the dimension-5 weinberg operators violating the lepton number by two units .",
    "usually ones estimate these processes will decouple at a very high temperature @xcite , @xmath38\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath39 being the majorana neutrino mass matrix .",
    "therefore , no lepton asymmetry can survive above the temperature @xmath40 if the neutrino masses arrives at an acceptable level . in our model ,",
    "the effective dimension-5 operators are induced by integrating out the scalars @xmath4 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 as well as the fermions @xmath41 .",
    "however , the fields @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath41 are near the tev scale , i.e. their masses are lighter than the crucial temperature @xmath40 .",
    "so , the estimation ( [ estimation ] ) is not consistent with the present scenario .",
    "actually , in our model , the cubic terms among the scalars @xmath4 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 provide the unique source of the lepton number violation .",
    "after this lepton number violation is decoupled , no other lepton - number - violating processes can keep in equilibrium to wash out the produced lepton asymmetry .",
    "in this paper we have simultaneously realized a high - scale leptogenesis and a low - scale neutrino mass generation .",
    "specifically we have introduced two real singlet scalars to the knt model which extended the sm by two singly charged scalars and two or more singlet fermions .",
    "the lepton - number - violating decays of the real scalars and then the lepton - number - conserving decays of the charged scalars can produce a lepton asymmetry stored in the sm leptons .",
    "this lepton asymmetry can be partially converted to a baryon asymmetry by the sphaleron processes . at the low energy scales",
    ", we can integrate out the real scalars to derive the knt model , where the neutrino masses are induced at three - loop level while the dark matter particle is given by the lightest singlet fermion .",
    "for the variant knt models @xcite , we can consider two real triplet or quintuplet scalars .    * acknowledgement * : the author was supported by the recruitment program for young professionals under grant no .",
