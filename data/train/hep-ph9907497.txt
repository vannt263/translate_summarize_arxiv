    "in a series of previous papers @xcite we analyzed charmonium hadroproduction in the light of the color - octet model @xcite .",
    "we employed a monte carlo generator ( pythia 5.7 ) @xcite to assess the importance of some higher - order qcd effects .",
    "as a consequence we concluded that nrqcd matrix elements @xcite determined from tevatron experimental data @xcite were considerably overestimated in other analysis @xcite , since they absorb some perturbative effects , e.g. initial - state emission of gluons .",
    "the latter gives rise to an effective transverse momentum , enhancing the high-@xmath5 tail of the differential distribution of charmonium .",
    "once taken into account , the extracted long - distance parameters have to be lowered significantly .",
    "this is especially apparent for the linear combination of matrix elements ( mes ) @xmath6 where , in fact , a large discrepancy w.r.t .",
    "hera results on @xmath4 photoproduction has been pointed out @xcite .",
    "however , in our former work we did not consider altarelli - parisi ( ap ) evolution of the fragmenting gluon into charmonium for the @xmath2 contribution at high @xmath5 . in this paper",
    "we implement such an effect benefitting from the evolution performed by pythia itself as will be explained below .",
    "we shall show that although our previous numerical values for the @xmath2 me were somewhat low , no significant change occurs for the corresponding @xmath6 me .",
    "we also discuss the sensitivity to the lower cut - off used to avoid the singular @xmath1 region .",
    "we get started with the latter point in the following section .",
    "production cross sections which are singular at @xmath8 are automatically regularized in running pythia by setting a @xmath5 lower cut - off at 1 gev @xcite . consistently with our aim of using by - default options whenever possible in the generation , we kept this value in all our previous analysis @xcite .",
    "in fact , the differential cross section can have a singular behaviour at low @xmath5 even to next - to - leading order due to imperfect cancellation of real and virtual contributions .",
    "however , from a nlo calculation of charmonium production by mangano @xcite , one may conclude that our previously used lower cut - off ( @xmath9 gev ) is consistent with the threshold obtained by mangano ( @xmath10 gev for the @xmath11 channel ) , such that the averaged cross section is zero below this value .    nevertheless , in order to assess the significance of the cut - off on the values of the long - distance parameters we performed new fits to tevatron data by changing @xmath7 .",
    "we found that , by varying @xmath7 in the @xmath12 $ ] gev range , the @xmath2 me showed almost no appreciable change , whereas the @xmath6 me changed by a factor two at most @xcite .",
    "therefore , we keep in our subsequent analysis the value @xmath9 gev as a self - consistent lower cut - off .",
    "at high transverse momentum , gluon fragmentation via the color octet mechanism becomes the dominant source of charmonium production . on the other hand ,",
    "ap evolution of the splitting gluon produces a depletion of its energy which has to be taken into account .",
    "if not so , the long - distance parameter for the @xmath2 channel would be underestimated .    in this work the ap evolution of the fragmenting gluon",
    "was carried out from the evolution of the gluonic partner of the @xmath4 in the final state of the production channel @xmath13 the technical reason being that the splitting gluon @xmath14 actually is not generated in our code @xcite .",
    "( notice however that the mes used in the generation include the long - distance evolution of the ( @xmath0 ) bound state @xcite . )    indeed , on the average the fragmenting gluon should evolve in the transverse plane similarly to the other final - state gluon in ( 1 ) , once corrected its virtuality to become of the order of the charmonium mass .",
    "thereby we get a correcting factor to be applied event by event to the transverse momentum of the generated @xmath4 ( for the @xmath2 channel only ) : @xmath15 where @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is the transverse momentum of the final - state gluon without ( with ) ap evolution .    at high @xmath5 , @xmath18 where @xmath5 is the transverse momentum of the @xmath4 as generated by pythia ( i.e. without ap evolution ) .",
    "although the above way to implement ap evolution may be somewhat indirect , it remains in the spirit of our whole analysis , i.e. using pythia algorithms whenever possible .",
    "in fact it provides an energy depletion of the fragmenting gluon in accordance with cho and leibovich s work @xcite .",
    "we have performed new fits to the tevatron data @xcite using three pdfs ( as in @xcite ) but now with ap evolution implemented in the generation as described in the preceding section . in table 1",
    "we show the numerical values for @xmath19 and the linear combination @xmath20 obtained in our analysis .",
    "the new values for the @xmath19 matrix elements have been increased by a factor about 3 w.r.t .",
    "ap off @xcite . conversely the @xmath21 value is slightly decreased , moreover remaining quite smaller than in other analysis @xcite .",
    "therefore we conclude that the @xmath21 value obtained in our work is reliable and in a better agreement with hera results on @xmath4 photoproduction @xcite .    [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in order to get an estimate of the expected charmonium production rate at the lhc , we ran pythia with the color - octet model implemented in . in figure 3",
    "we show the predicted differential cross section times the muonic branching fraction of @xmath4 with ap evolution included . in figure 2",
    "we show the same curve with ap off . by comparison",
    ", one may conclude that , once adjusted the long - distance parameters to fit tevatron data , there is no significant difference between both generations .",
    "let us stress that because of theoretical uncertainties associated to different choices for the charm mass , energy scales , parton distribution function ... , the theoretical curves of figures 2 and 3 have to be considered as order - of - magnitude predictions .",
    "nevertheless the relatively high production rate at high-@xmath5 ( of the order of the pb at @xmath22 gev ) makes especially interesting the analysis of charmonia production at the lhc .",
    "a preliminary study on @xmath23 prompt production leads to a similar conclusion for the bottomonia family .",
    "after checking our analysis by varying the lower @xmath5 cut - off set in the monte carlo generation to avoid the problematic @xmath1 region , we conclude that our former choice @xmath9 gev was justified and our study of charmonium hadroproduction trustworthy . on the other hand , once implemented altarelli - parisi evolution in our framework , the new extracted values of the color - octet me @xmath19 increase ( table 1 ) , recovering a similar result as in previous extractions @xcite . on the other hand , the numerical values obtained for @xmath21 even decrease slightly , reinforcing the conclusions reported in our former work @xcite .",
    "with respect to the extrapolation of the @xmath4 production rate up to lhc energy , the theoretical prediction incorporating ap evolution ( figure 3 ) does not differ significantly from the curve obtained without ap evolution ( figure 2 ) .",
    "this means that , from a practical point of view , there is no need to modify the code for a fast generation as shown in @xcite if the corresponding color - octet matrix elements are duly employed .",
    "finally we conclude that the analysis of charmonia ( and bottomonia ) prompt production at the lhc deserves special attention in its own right .",
