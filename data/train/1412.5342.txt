    "the relation is however non - trivial for the case when we have an entanglement breaking bosonic gaussian channel that is not nonclassicality breaking in the rhs of eq .. then theorem 2 tells that the entanglement breaking bosonic gaussian channel can still be decomposed into a nonclassicality breaking bosonic gaussian channel followed by a suitable canonical unitary as mentioned in eq . and that the corresponding canonical unitary solely depends on the channel parameters of the entanglement breaking bosonic gaussian channel as shown in theorem 2 .",
    "one could also view the relation in eq . in an equivalent way : every entanglement breaking bosonic gaussian channel can be decomposed into a nonclassicality breaking channel followed by a suitable gaussian unitary .",

    "+ _ proof _ : this is a straightforward consequence of theorem 2 .",
    "it is well known that for every entanglement breaking channel the classical capacity is additive and its quantum capacity is zero@xcite .",
    "the statement of the corollary follows from the fact that every nonclassicality breaking bosonic gaussian channel is automatically entanglement breaking .",
    "hence the classical capacity is additive and the quantum capacity is zero for every nonclassicality breaking bosonic gaussian channel.@xmath128",

    "we depict the set - theoretic nature of the various notions of a bosonic gaussian channel in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "the conditions for a bosonic gaussian channel to be ppt or entanglement breaking were previously known .",
    "the criterion for bosonic gaussian channels to be nonclassicality breaking was derived in this article and is listed in table[table2 ] , alongside other fundamental properties of gaussian states and their channel counterpart in very close analogy .",
    "further , we proved an interesting duality that every nonclassicality breaking bosonic gaussian channels is entanglement breaking and that every entanglement breaking bosonic gaussian channel can be rendered nonclassicality breaking by the action of a gaussian unitary whose active component consists only of parallel single - mode canonical squeezing elements ; the unitary being dependent only on the channel parameters of the entanglement breaking bosonic gaussian channel .",
    "we find that , in general , too much noise could be detrimental as it can render the channel nonclassicality breaking .",
    "in such a case the channel is not only entanglement breaking but it also only produces classical outputs and hence is ineffective for protocols aiming to exploit the power of nonclassical states . in effect , the condition in theorem 1 can be interpreted as a kind of nonclassicality benchmark for bosonic gaussian channels in the sense that every bosonic gaussian channel satisfying this criterion is guaranteed to produce only classical states at the output irrespective of the input .    in other words , the nonclassical character of a bosonic gaussian channel is quantified in terms of the noise it can tolerate beyond which all the output states are rendered classical . since nonclassicality is a crucial resource for quantum protocols , such a characterization is of practical importance .",

    "<S> the glauber - sudarshan diagonal ` weight ' function provides a natural divide between the quantum - optical notion of classical and nonclassical states of continuous variables systems . based on this demarcation </S>",
    "<S> , a channel is said to be nonclassicality breaking if it outputs only classical states for any input state . </S>",
    "<S> we use the notion of nonclassicality breaking channels to study the ` nonclassical character ' of a quantum channel . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on multimode bosonic gaussian channels and classify those that are nonclassicality breaking by introducing a criterion that needs to be satisfied by the matrices representing these channels . </S>",
    "<S> the criterion can be interpreted as a nonclassicality benchmark for these channels since it quantifies the threshold noise at which there is a complete nonclassical to classical transition of the output states , i.e. , it quantifies the robustness of the nonclassicality of the outputs of the channel against gaussian noise . </S>",
    "<S> we then prove a striking ` duality ' between nonclassicality breaking and entanglement breaking bosonic gaussian channels . </S>"
