    "in the 1950ies , fermi and coworkers started to measure pion - nucleon cross sections and to analyze the data in terms of partial waves , leading the way to the discovery of a large number of baryon resonances . in 1963 , in a partial - wave analysis performed at the lawrence livermore national laboratory , l. d. roper found a @xmath2 resonance at @xmath3  gev ( @xmath4  mev pion laboratory kinetic energy )  @xcite .",
    "the result was surprizing as there were no hints for such a state and the @xmath2 scattering length is rather large and negative . in words of roper : _ i spent a much time trying to eliminate the @xmath2 resonance _  @xcite .",
    "the particle data group estimates for the main @xmath5 properties are listed in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "l r +   +   + [ 0.05 cm ] +   + [ 0.2 cm ] decay modes & fraction ( @xmath6 ) + @xmath7 & 0.55 to 0.75 + @xmath8 & @xmath9  % + @xmath10 & @xmath11  % + @xmath12 & @xmath13 8  % + @xmath14 & @xmath15  % + @xmath16 & @xmath17  % + @xmath18 & @xmath19  % +    considerable uncertainties are apparent , specially in the full breit - wigner width and the branching ratios to the strong - decay channels .",
    "indeed , different values are obtained with different models , most of them built in terms of breit - wigner resonances plus background , meson - exchange or @xmath20-matrix formalisms .",
    "for example , the recent @xmath20-matrix multichannel analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , which combines single and double - pion production data induced by pions and photons finds a @xmath21  % , in agreement with the pdg , but a smaller @xmath22  % and a considerably larger @xmath23  % ( to be compared to the @xmath24 5 - 10  % pdg estimate ) .",
    "pole positions and residues allow for a parameterization of resonances in a well - defined way , free of assumptions for the background and energy dependence of the resonance part  @xcite .",
    "actually , many different studies find for the roper resonance two almost degenerate poles close to the @xmath25 threshold on two different riemann sheets of the @xmath25 channel  @xcite .",
    "the pole positions are stable against larger variations of parameters in meson - exchange mechanisms , with averaged values of @xmath26  mev and @xmath27  mev  @xcite .",
    "the second pole is a replica or shadow of the first one without strong physical implications rather than a new structure  @xcite . in spite of this agreement ,",
    "the dynamical origin of the roper poles is not clear : while in the jlms model of ref .",
    "@xcite , they evolve from a single bare state that also gives rise to the @xmath28 , no genuine pole term is required in the jlich model  @xcite .",
    "in a simple quark model with a harmonic oscillator potential it is easy to understand why it is unexpected to have a radial excitation of the nucleon as the first @xmath0 .",
    "the energy spectrum is given by @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "if the lowest state with @xmath31 , @xmath32 is associated with the nucleon ( @xmath33 ) , then the first excited state with @xmath34 , @xmath35 is @xmath36 and only the next one with @xmath37 , @xmath32 is an @xmath38 like the roper .",
    "however , the first negative parity state @xmath39  @xmath40 turns out to be heavier than the @xmath1  @xmath2 .",
    "this parity reversal pattern can not be described by successful quark models based on @xmath41 symmetry with residual color - spin interactions between quarks ( see for instance fig .",
    "9 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "some authors argue that reverse parity is an indication that at low energies the interactions among constituent quarks could be dominated by flavor - dependent goldstone boson exchange ( gbe ) ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) . with this assumption",
    "it is possible to obtain a good description of the low - lying baryon spectrum and , in particular , the correct level ordering between the @xmath5 and the @xmath42 , as can be seen in fig .  4 of ref .",
    "the model has been extended to include the exchange of vector and scalar mesons to account for correlated multiple gbe , although the special nature of pseudoscalar goldstone bosons does not extend to other mesons .",
    "besides , the special status of mesons in this model makes it difficult to achieve a unified description of both mesons and baryons  @xcite .",
    "further understanding of the nature of the roper resonance and the level ordering may be provided by lattice qcd . in a recent study , the first positive and negative parity excited states of the nucleon",
    "have been obtained with variational analysis in quenched qcd  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath43 state is below the @xmath44 one for heavy quark masses , but the physical ordering is recovered for pion masses below 380  mev ( see fig.10 of ref .",
    "caution should be exercised in the interpretation of this result obtained in quenched qcd and for which the identification of the @xmath43 at low quark masses , where finite lattice volume effects become significant , still remains .",
    "if confirmed , this level crossing could support the hypothesis that there is a transition from heavy quarks , where @xmath41 symmetry with color - spin interactions works well , to light quarks where flavor - spin interactions due to gbe prevail  @xcite .    to circumvent the parity reversal problem ,",
    "alternative descriptions in which the roper resonance is not ( only ) a @xmath45 state have also been proposed .",
    "for instance , it could have a large gluonic component @xmath46 , although the masses of such hybrid states calculated with the flux - tube model are quite large ( @xmath47  mev )  @xcite . in one of its oldest representations , the roper appears as a collective vibration of the bag surface , a breathing mode .",
    "indeed , with the skyrme model , where baryons are topological solitons of the meson nonlinear fields , a resonance was found in the breathing mode spectrum with a mass of @xmath48  mev  @xcite . in line with the collective picture ,",
    "juli - daz and riska explored the presence of @xmath49 components in the roper resonance  @xcite .",
    "they found that the confining interaction mixes the @xmath45 and @xmath50 components .",
    "the @xmath50 admixture in the roper ranges from 3 to 25  % depending on the constituent quark mass while the @xmath51 components are negligible",
    ". the @xmath45 component could even be totally absent in the @xmath5 as suggested by the fact that the resonance shape is dynamically generated in the jlich model from meson - baryon interactions in coupled channels , mostly from the @xmath52 s - wave interaction  @xcite . finally , if the baryons are regarded as many - body systems of quarks and gluons , it is natural to expect that they could be deformed .",
    "such a possibility was investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , with a deformed oscillator potential .",
    "it was shown that low lying masses fit well to rotational spectra with the roper as an @xmath37 rotational state .",
    "although the vast majority of the information about the @xmath5 has been extracted from the @xmath53 reaction , there are many other processes where the resonance properties can be studied and/or where the reaction mechanism can not be understood without taking it into account . some of these processes are reviewed in this section .",
    "valuable information about nucleon resonances is encoded in the electromagnetic @xmath54 transitions , often presented in terms of helicity amplitudes connecting states with well defined helicities . in the case of the @xmath55 transition ,",
    "two such amplitudes should be introduced , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , defined as @xmath58 here , @xmath59 is fine - structure constant , @xmath60 , @xmath61 is the four - momentum transfered to the nucleon and @xmath62 stand for the transverse and longitudinal polarizations of the virtual photon . the @xmath55 transition electromagnetic current can be parametrized with two form factors @xmath63 u(p ) \\ , .",
    "\\label{current}\\ ] ] this current is very similar to the nucleon one , except for the @xmath64 part . in the nucleon case ,",
    "the form factor associated with this operator has to vanish to ensure current conservation , but not for the @xmath65 transition because the roper mass differs from the nucleon one .",
    "introducing electric and magnetic form factors , in analogy to the sachs form factors of the nucleon and substituting eq .",
    "( [ current ] ) in the expressions for the helicity amplitudes , one obtains that up to well known factors @xmath66 and @xmath67  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath55 helicity amplitudes have been studied using various models with a wide diversity of results .",
    "some of these are shown in fig .",
    "[ hel ] , namely , the prediction from the non - relativistic quark model ( nrqm )  @xcite , the hybrid model  @xcite , the light - front relativistic quark model ( lf ) calculation of ref .",

    "the result of the global maid07 analysis  @xcite is given by the thick solid line.,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    the extensive @xmath0 program at jlab has provided a large amount of precision data on pion electroproduction which , together with the data from previous experiments at mit / bates and mami / mainz , has made possible the extraction of the transition helicity amplitudes at @xmath68  @xmath69 the for several resonances and , in particular , for the roper  @xcite .",
    "the result from the global maid07 analysis is also shown in fig .  [ hel ] .",
    "the comparison with the models reveals that none of them is really satisfactory .",
    "this is an indication of the difficulties that quark models encounter in the description of the low @xmath70  @xmath69 region . at @xmath71   @xmath69 , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are positive and decreasing ,",
    "good agreement is obtained with relativistic quark model calculations assuming that the roper is the first radial excitation of the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "the discrepancies at low @xmath74 are interpreted as due to the missing meson cloud effects .",
    "the importance of the pion cloud , particularly at low @xmath74 , has also been demonstrated in a recent study of electroproduction amplitudes with the simple cloudy bag model  @xcite .",
    "the pion cloud is found to be responsible for the large and negative value of @xmath72 at the photon point , while the quark dynamics becomes progressively relevant as @xmath74 increases , causing @xmath72 to change sign .",
    "it is important to bare in mind that extraction of helicities amplitudes in both the maid  @xcite and clas  @xcite analyses imply certain model dependent assumptions about the resonant and non - resonant parts of the pion electroproduction amplitudes . for this reason ,",
    "alternative methods are being pursued , like the extraction of transition form factors at the resonance poles using analytic continuation  @xcite .",
    "the excitation of the roper resonance in @xmath75 and @xmath76 reactions can only be assessed with partial wave analyses ; in the reaction cross section , the @xmath1  @xmath2 overlaps with the @xmath77  @xmath78 and the @xmath39  @xmath40 forming the so called second resonance region .",
    "moreover , all these @xmath0 states might be masked by the prominent @xmath79 excitation since @xmath75 and @xmath76 interactions mix isospin 1/2 and 3/2 .",
    "however , certain reactions act as filters , making the direct observation of the roper excitation possible .",
    "an example is the @xmath80 reaction of proton target studied at saturne with a beam energy of 4.2  gev  @xcite .",
    "as the projectile has @xmath81 , the @xmath82 excitation can occur on the projectile but not on the target .",
    "for this reason the roper excitation appears as small peak on the tail of the dominant @xmath82 excitation ( see fig .  2 of ref .",
    "the theoretical study of hirenzaki et al .",
    "@xcite showed that the isoscalar excitation on the proton is the dominant @xmath5 production mechanism and extracted its strength from data .",
    "the fact that the interference with the @xmath82 excitation on the @xmath59 is important allowed to establish also the relative sign of the amplitudes .",
    "an even clearer case of direct @xmath5 observation has been made by the bes collaboration with the decay @xmath83",
    "@xcite . here , because of isospin conservation , the @xmath75 system is in pure isospin @xmath84 .",
    "several @xmath0 were observed in the @xmath75 invariant mass distribution , the first of them corresponding to the roper resonance .",
    "its mass and width , estimated with a simple breit - wigner function were found to be @xmath85  mev and @xmath86  mev respectively . as a constant width",
    "was used in the breit - wigner , the extracted mass is close to the pole value .",
    "the roper resonance is a vital ingredient in double - pion production reaction mechanisms . in spite of its small branching ratio , the s - wave character of the @xmath87 decay ( or @xmath88 as often denoted in the literature )",
    "makes it a very important nonvanishing contribution at threshold .",
    "this is the case for the @xmath89 reaction , as was shown long ago in ref .",
    "@xcite and supported by other models .",
    "for instance , in fig .",
    "10 of ref .",
    "@xcite the dotted lines denoting the results without @xmath5 are well below the full model ( and the data ) in the channels where the @xmath87 decay is allowed .",
    "the relevance of the roper is even more dramatic in @xmath90 , where according to the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , the isoscalar excitation of the resonance , followed by its decay into @xmath91 appears to be dominant at laboratory kinetic energies of the incident proton @xmath92  gev .",
    "the other two important reaction mechanisms : @xmath93 excitation and @xmath94 are negligible at threshold but rise fast to become important above @xmath95  gev . in recent years , this reaction has been accurately measured at celsius and cosy . at low energies , the main features predicted by the model of ref .  @xcite have been confirmed ( see for instance ref .",
    "the situation is more involved at higher energies : an isospin analysis of the data  @xcite indicates that the contribution from heavier @xmath96 states might be important .",
    "resonances with masses up to 1.72  gev have been incorporated in the relativistic model of cao et al .",
    "@xcite , finding large contributions from the @xmath97 and @xmath98 states .",
    "the agreement to data is improved by reducing the @xmath99 branching ratio , in line with the findings of ref .",
    "@xcite .    the @xmath90 model of ref .",
    "@xcite does not include interferences but , in particular , the interference between the @xmath91 and @xmath100 decay modes of the roper has been found to explain some details of the invariant mass and angular distributions for @xmath89 ( fig .  12 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath90 ( fig .  4 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) and specially @xmath101 . for this later reaction",
    ", it has been shown that the shape of the double differential cross sections measured at lampf with a neutron beam of @xmath102  gev@xmath103  @xcite can be explained by the above mentioned interference between the two - pion decay modes of the roper resonance  @xcite . as shown in fig  [ deut ] , by taking into account the roper",
    "one obtains a good description of the size and energy dependence of the total @xmath101 cross section even with a rather simple model as the one of ref .",
