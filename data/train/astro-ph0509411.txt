    "microquasars are stellar x - ray binaries ( neutron stars or black holes ) from which relativistic jets emanate via an unknown , very efficient mechanism @xcite .",
    "microquasars such as ss 433 and grs 1915 + 105 occasionally exhibit massive jet ejections , which are recognized as sporadic flares in their radio light curves @xcite . because the massive jet ejections are rare ( a few per year ) , short ( within a few days ) , and aperiodic , pointing x - ray observations of these events",
    "have hardly been performed so far . as for ss  433 , no x - ray observation has been confirmed to coincide with a radio flare , except for one or two possible coincident observations with einstein in 1979 @xcite .",
    "a monitoring observation over 10 days and a long - look observation lasting 13 days were performed with asca in 1995 and 2000 @xcite , but there was no radio flare coinciding the periods . a multi - wavelength observation with rxte and",
    "the giant meter radio telescope in 2002 also misses radio flares @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that the massive jets are distinct from the stable continuous jets of ss  433 and the quasi - continuous or weak jet of grs  1915 + 105 .",
    "the radio activity of ss  433 monitored with the green bank interferometer over years may be characterized as a clustering of flare events separated by periods of quiescent emission @xcite . in those sporadic radio flare events , the radio flux density at 2.3 ghz exceeds 1 jy ,",
    "and massive jet blobs , which are recognized as bright extended spots in radio images , are ejected from the core of ss 433 at a quarter of the speed of light @xcite .",
    "the ejection of massive jet blobs from grs 1915 + 105 with a radio flux exceeding 100 mjy , by which the source has been recognized as a microquasar in the first place @xcite , have been hardly observed in x rays @xcite , in contrast to a number of reports on the x - ray observation of the quasi - continuous or weak jet ejections @xcite .",
    "we report on a successful x - ray observation of a massive jet ejection from ss  433 with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) .",
    "the observation scheme is described in   [ sec : obs ] , the data are analyzed and discussed in   [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "formerly , a radio flare was the only indicator of a massive jet ejection .",
    "unfortunately , an x - ray observation triggered by a radio flare is too late to catch the moment of the ejection , as experienced in the cases of several previous target - of - opportunity ( too ) x - ray observations .",
    "because the x - ray activity precedes a radio flare , a too x - ray observation will not work for a massive jet ejection event .",
    "so we have built a strategy to observe a _",
    "second _ massive jet ejection event following the first event . in the active state of ss  433 ,",
    "radio flares are clustered with an interval of  @xmath0 days @xcite .",
    "therefore , a series of monitoring observations triggered by a massive jet ejection may cover the moment of a second ejection in  23 days .",
    "we planned a 30-days - long too monitoring observation of ss  433 with rxte to be triggered by a radio flare .",
    "the proposal was accepted in the cycle 6 of the rxte guest observer program carried out for one year beginning in march 2001 .",
    "the daily radio activity of the source has been monitored with the ratan-600 radio telescope @xcite of the special astrophysical observatory of the russian academy of sciences ( sao ras ) since september 2001 .",
    "after two months of static activity with an average flux density of 0.7 jy at 2.3 ghz , a remarkable flare occurred on 2001 november 2 ( mjd = 52215 ) , indicating that the source entered its active state ( fig .",

    "flux densities reached 1.3 jy at 2.3 ghz on mjd = 52216.6 @xcite .",
    "we started a series of x - ray observations with rxte on mjd = 52222 @xcite .",
    "except for a break at mjd = 52231 , ss 433 was observed for 3 ks every day . in the x - ray light curve ,",
    "a temporal variation with time scales of @xmath1 s appeared on mjd = 52225 and the amplitude increased day by day ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lc_x ] ) .",
    "on mjd = 52232 , the amplitude reached a maximum , and the 2 - 10 kev x - ray flux reached a local maximum of @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "the x - ray emission , thought to originate in the hot part of the jets as long as or longer than @xmath5 cm , had never shown such a variability in past observations @xcite .",
    "following the maximum of the flux and the variation amplitude , a second radio flare was detected on mjd = 52235 .",
    "due to a missing radio data point at mjd = 52234 , the precise onset time and peak flux of the second flare are unfortunately not known , but they are not likely out of a range @xmath6mjd@xmath7 and @xmath8 jy @xmath9 f @xmath9 2 jy . thus we conclude that the moment of a massive jet ejection was observed in the x - ray band . after the peak , the x - ray flux dropped due to a binary eclipse .",

    "a super - critical accretion flow , which ss  433 is believed to have , had not been observed in the x - ray band because of the bright jets .",
    "the 0.1 hz qpo - like feature may be the first detection of the super - critical accretion flow or disk in the x - ray band .",
    "the similarity to the qpo in other microquasars suggests the presence of a common mechanism working in other systems and ss  433 , at least when the latter is undergoing a massive jet ejection .",

    "the equivalent width is not sensitive to eclipse because the base of the jet , which is responsible to both of the doppler - shifted line emission and the continuum emission , is occulted in eclipse @xcite .",
    "then we examined the rapid variation seen on mjd = 52232 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lc_x ] ) .",
    "the variation , which might appear irregular or chaotic , can be interpreted as a series of `` shots '' or `` spikes''with widths of tens of seconds .",
    "their intervals are random and do not show any periodicity .",
    "we have sampled 12 shots as indicated in fig .  [",

    "this is the first detection of a rapid x - ray variability with a time scale less than 300 s from ss  433 @xcite .",
    "although this source had been observed for numerous times with various x - ray observatories , only variability with time scales as long as or longer than a day had been reported .",
    "for example , einstein observed the source to vary by a factor of 2 on time scales of a day @xcite , and daily variations other than the orbital and precessional modulations are seen in ginga and asca data @xcite .",
    "temporal analysis of rosat data shows flickering around 3 - 10 s , but this variability does not appear consistently @xcite . since the detection with rxte in 2001 @xcite , evidences of rapid x - ray variability have been accumulated .",
    "@xcite report on x - ray variability with time scales of a few minutes detected in 2002 with rxte , and @xcite detected a significant x - ray variability with time scales as short as 100 s with rxte in 2004 .    the absence or weakness of a rapid x - ray variability had been explained in terms of the x - ray - emitting jet as long as or longer than @xmath5 cm .",
    "together with the qpo - like feature in the power density spectrum , this shot - like variability implies the presence of x - ray sources smaller than @xmath5 cm in the system . considering that these shots coincide a massive jet ejection event",
    ", we further assume that they are related to the ejection in the following discussion .",
    "since the spectral fit is consistent with a decrease of the absorption hydrogen column density during the evolution of the shots , we attribute the rise of the shots to the decrease of attenuating matter , or in other words , the emergence of an x - ray - emitting small plasma bullet from behind attenuating matter .",
    "each shot literally corresponds to a shot of a small plasma bullet from the nozzle .",
    "this interpretation is different from that of the x - ray variability seen in grs  1915 + 105 , which is explained in terms of the rapid removal and replenishment of matter forming the inner part of an accretion disk @xcite . since both thermal and non - thermal spectral models are consistent with the observed spectrum , it is difficult to determine the emission mechanism .",
    "but in either case , physical quantities of the emitting bullets would be derived as follows .",

    "the knots are created when the mass outflow rate or the density of the continuous jet is temporarily increased .",
    "a temporal increase of temperature is not plausible , because it would result in a change of the spectrum , which has not been observed .",
    "the properties of the knots would not be much different from those of the small plasma bullets discussed above , and the estimates above are valid if the knots or bullets coexist with the continuous jet .      because the spectral shape does not much change in the decay and because no iron line is detected in the shot component , a non - thermal emission from expanding bullets also can account for the shot component .",
    "as for the steady non - variable component , it is definitely a thin - thermal emission with doppler - shifted iron lines .",
    "therefore , it is natural to interpret the shot component as a thermal emission , and an interpretation of non - thermal emission is rather eccentric . in the following paragraph , we show physical parameters of a plasma bullet assuming that the bullets emit x ray via synchrotron radiation .    a power - law distribution of synchrotron electrons ,",

    "the maximum lorentz factor should be at least @xmath90 to account for the x - ray emission up to 10 kev .",
    "optically thin synchrotron flux from such a sphere is expressed as @xmath91 where @xmath92 is frequency , and @xmath93 is the magnetic field strength in the plasma , ( e.g. , @xcite ) . by substituting the observed flux @xmath94(1 kev ) = @xmath95 photons @xmath4 s@xmath3 kev@xmath3 into eq .",

    "as the bullet expands , each high - energy electron loses energy as @xmath99 and the magnetic field and the luminosity decreases as @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively .",
    "radiative cooling and heating are neglected .",
    "thus a decrease of flux by a factor of @xmath72 corresponds to an adiabatic expansion by @xmath102 of the radiating bullet . further assuming that the bullet is proceeding at 0.26 @xmath103 with an expanding half angle of @xmath104 , which are the same value as the velocity and the half opening angle of the continuous jet @xcite , the expansion velocity is estimated as @xmath105 cm s@xmath3 . from this expansion velocity and the expansion factor obtained above ,",
    "the radius of the plasma is determined as @xmath106 cm , which is consistent with the rise time of 20 s.    the synchrotron - electron number density and the strength of the magnetic field can be estimated if their energies are assumed to be in equipartition , i.e. , @xmath107 substituting an electron energy index of @xmath108 , we obtain @xmath109 g and @xmath110 @xmath82 .",
    "the total number of electrons and internal energy in a bullet are estimated as @xmath111 per shot and @xmath112 erg , respectively .",
    "these number of electrons and internal energy derived here are smaller by orders of magnitude than those of the thin - thermal case .",
    "if the emission mechanism is inverse - compton scattering of optical photons , the seed - photon density would decrease and the emission would decay as the plasma bullet gets away from the central engine .",
    "based on this comptonized - emission model , the parameters of the plasma bullet , such as the electron number density , the total number of electrons , and the total energy of electrons , are estimated .",
    "they are found to be not much different from those in the case of synchrotron emission , although the uncertainties of parameters are larger in the case of inverse - comptonization .      based on the bullets model ,",
    "we suggest an explanation of the massive jet ejection : during the massive jet ejection event , small discrete plasma bullets , or knots in the continuously emanating flow , are successively ejected at random intervals of @xmath113 s. the radius of bullets is estimated as @xmath78 cm .",
    "the x - ray emission from the small plasma bullets , either thermal or non - thermal , decays in 40 s as it expands . assuming that the most active state lasts 3 days , the total number of small bullets ejected in a single massive jet event is estimated to be 1700 .",
    "the total mass and total kinetic energy of all the 1700 bullets are @xmath114 g and @xmath115 erg , respectively .",
    "the average mass ejection rate and average kinetic luminosity over 3 days are @xmath116 g s@xmath3 and @xmath117 erg s@xmath3 , respectively . in the case of synchrotron emission from baryonic plasma",
    ", only the lower limits of mass and kinetic energy are derived ; the total mass and total kinetic energy of the 1700 bullets would be at least @xmath118 g and @xmath119 erg , respectively , and the average mass ejection rate and average kinetic luminosity would be at least @xmath120 g and @xmath121 erg s@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the estimated average kinetic luminosity of @xmath122 erg s@xmath3 is considerably lower than estimates based on the quiescent or normal state .",
    "for example , @xcite has calculated the kinetic luminosity as @xmath123 erg s@xmath3 based on asca data , @xcite as @xmath124 erg s@xmath3 based on hetgs / chandra data , and @xcite as @xmath125 erg s@xmath3 based on epic / xmm - newton data .",
    "it is puzzling that the mass outflow rate and kinetic luminosity in the massive jet ejection are not so `` massive '' compared to those of the steady continuous jet flow seen in most occasions .",
    "there are several possibilities to account for the inconsistency in terms of the bullets model : 1 ) the mass outflow rate and kinetic luminosity of a massive jet are not larger than those of quiescent steady jet , but the efficiency to accelerate electrons contributing to synchrotron radio emission is far larger .",
    "2 ) the massive jet is not an assembly of the small plasma bullets , but mainly supplied with the steady flow which coexists with the bullets .",
    "3 ) in spite of the monitoring observation with a sampling rate of 3 ks a day , we have missed the moment of the true massive jet ejection , which lasts only , say , hours , and a massive jet of @xmath126 erg is ejected at a maximum outflow rate of @xmath127 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "we do not yet have an evidence supporting one of them , but suggest that the second case is unlikely , in which the unvariable x - ray component is expected to rise as the radio flux densities rise .",
    "another question is whether x - ray variability is really related to radio flaring , which is associated with blob rebrightening events out of the system core . at 1.6 ghz , radio flares peak at 35 au from the core @xcite .",
    "if radio flares were caused by an environmental condition , it would not be detectable in x - ray band at the ejection , and the coincidence of the rapid x - ray variability and the massive jet event would be accidental .",
    "however , @xcite suggest that the rebrightening is due to the attenuation by out - flowing gas around the core . if the cause of radio flares is not an environmental condition but a core activity , the activity which changes the radio flux by a factor of 2 might be detectable in x - ray band . that should be tested in future multi - wavelength observations .",
    "x - ray shots are firstly seen in the data from mjd = 52225 , a week before its maximum activity and the onset of a second radio flare .",
    "provided that shots precede a radio flare , we can predict a massive jet - ejection event based on x - ray monitoring data . on detection of x - ray shots , notice of a massive jet ejection to occur in a week can be sent to ground and space observatories .",
    "an observation campaign covering a massive jet ejection is possible .",
    "there is still a possibility that the duration of a massive jet ejection is shorter than  1 day and the moment has been missed even in our observations .",
    "it can be confirmed in future observations . and this technique may be applicable for prediction of massive jet ejections from other microquasars . in spite of numerous observations performed so far",
    ", it is not yet known whether massive jet ejections from other microquasars such as grs  1915 + 105 are also preceded by a precursor or not . as a specially coordinated observation",
    "is required to detect the shot - like variability from ss  433 , a carefully coordinated observations plan is desirable to observe grs  1915 + 105 in a massive jet ejection event with an x - ray mission .",
