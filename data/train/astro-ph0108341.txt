    ". the asymmetry growth reduced neutrino oscillations effect and lead up to @xmath92 underproduction of helium in respect to the model of cn with oscillations but neglecting asymmetry .",
    "hence dynamically produced asymmetry leads to a noticeable weakening of the cosmological constraints for small mixing angles  @xcite .",
    "however , the precise numerical description of the asymmetry growth requires more than 5 000 bins for the spectrum distortion , which was found essential for the correct calculation of the asymmetry evolution  @xcite .",
    "this increases enormously the calculational time in the resonant case .",
    "besides , the neutrino evolution equations at resonance have high stiffness and implicit methods should be used to solve the equations numerically . for 5 000 bins of the spectrum a system of 30 000 integro - differential equations describing the neutrino density evolution should be solved simultaneously .",
    "hopefully , the asymmetry effect on cn for large mass differences may be successfully analytically estimated using the analytical approximations , accounting for the spectrum distortion of neutrino , like the one proposed in  @xcite for small mixing angles and large mass differences .",
    "such approximations maybe very useful for analyzing oscillations effect on cn , because they simplify the equations and reduce the computational time .",
    "the case of different _ initial asymmetries _",
    ", namely @xmath93 , in models of cn with _ nonresonant _ oscillations , effective after electron neutrino freeze - out , was precisely studied in  @xcite .",
    "it was found that depending on the concrete values of the relic asymmetry , it may suppress , enhance or not influence oscillations , and hence lead to an under- , overproduction of helium or to not changing its abundance at all .",
    "the possibility of lepton asymmetry to enhance oscillations , besides its well - known ability to suppress them , was revealed thanks to the study of neutrino evolution at each momentum :    for the parameters of the model the local term @xmath94 dominates over the other terms for the mean neutrino momenta , and hence the resonant condition is not fulfilled : @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "however , for neutrinos with a given momentum @xmath97 it is fulfilled and these neutrinos suffer a resonant transfer leading to the decrease of their number densities and a decrease of the asymmetry ( since the resonance condition is fulfilled only in one sector , either neutrino or neutrino one , the particle densities in the other sector do not change ) .",
    "then , due to the @xmath94 decrease , resonant transfer becomes possible for neutrinos with higher momentum , and so on till @xmath94 changes sign and the running resonance wave similarly passes through the antineutrino ensemble , leading to a rapid increase of @xmath94 again till the next change of sign of @xmath94 , etc .",
    "i.e. the observed enhancement is `` spectrum resonance '' effect .",
    "the total effect of the process is enhanced resonance transfer both in neutrino and antineutrino sectors , leading to greater overproduction of helium-4 .",
    "oscillation constraints for the case of cn with oscillations and with initial @xmath94 were obtained  @xcite .    a similar investigation for the resonant case will be more complicated due to technical problems because it will deserve much greater number of bins for the spectrum distortion description because of the asymmetry growth , and hence , longer calculational time .",
    "however , this investigation is interesting , as far as such small values of the initial relic asymmetry are not excluded neither from observations nor from some profound theoretical principle .    in conclusion",
    "we would like to stress that even a very small asymmetry , either initially present or dynamically generated , thanks to its indirect effect through neutrino oscillations is capable to influence strongly cn .",
    "hence it should be accounted for as precisely as possible .      in case neutrino oscillations between active and sterile neutrinos proceed in the primordial plasma during the cn epoch , they can effect cn in the following ways :    \\(a ) in case active neutrinos have not decoupled , their oscillations to sterile ones may bring additional degrees of freedom into the primordial heat bath .",
    "this will lead to an increase of the universe expansion rate h(t ) and to an earlier freezing of the @xmath13 - ratio , at times when neutrons were more abundant in comparison with the sbbn .",

    "as far as the oscillation rate is energy dependent @xmath99 the low energy neutrinos start to oscillate first , and later the oscillations become noticeable for the more energetic neutrinos . due to that , the spectrum of the neutrinos ( antineutrinos ) may become strongly distorted , especially in the case of oscillations into less abundant sterile neutrinos .",
    "this effect was shown considerable both in the vacuum oscillations case  @xcite and matter oscillations case  @xcite .",
    "spectrum distortion of the electron neutrinos due to oscillations leads to overproduction of helium-4 , which may be several times larger than he-4 overproduction due to an additional neutrino type .",
