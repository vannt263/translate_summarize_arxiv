    "how can one formulate , in the hamiltonian formalism , the classical system of a particle constrained on a curved surface ? starting with a classical - mechanical system for that constrained particle , how can one obtain a quantum - mechanical one ?",

    ", poisson brackets play a main role when we deal with a system without constraints .",
    "when we are confronted , on the other hand , with a constrained system , the dirac brackets take their place . making use of the dirac brackets , we can consistently formulate the constrained system in an elegant way .",
    "noticing the point that the dirac brackets for the constrained system play the role of the poisson brackets for the unconstrained system , we can quantize the classical constrained system , i.e. , we can answer the second question .",
    "the dirac brackets are to be replaced , in quantization , by the commutators ( @xmath0 ) . along this canonical - quantization method , therefore , it is important that we describe the system in the language of the hamiltonian formalism , not of the lagrangian formalism .    now , let us focus our attention on the system of a particle constrained on a _ two - dimensional _ closed surface . the simplest closed surface is a sphere .",
    "quantum mechanics for a particle on a sphere has been studied by many researchers@xcite , among whom are falck and hirshfeld@xcite .    from the mathematical viewpoint",
    ", any compact orientable surface is known to be homeomorphic to a sphere or a connected sum of tori@xcite .",

    "two coordinate systems are used , one is cartesian and the other toric .",
    "the reason why the toric coordinate system is useful is that one can here easily obtain coordinate representations of momentum operators . in sec.3",
    "we quantize the system with the canonical - quantization method . in the classical theory of a particle constrained on a surface",
    ", the dirac brackets of the canonical variables are complicated in structure if one deals with the system in cartesian coordinates , as shown in sec.2.1 .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to obtain the coordinate representations of momentum operators .",
    "there are two ways available to avoid that difficulty .",
    "one is to choose a suitable coordinate system for the dynamical system in which the dirac brackets come to have simple structures .",
    "the other was shown by homma , inamoto and miyazaki in case of a sphere@xcite .",
    "they took up the time derivative of the equation of a surface as a constraint condition .",
    "we go along the former way in the present paper . in sec.3.1",
    "we study quantization in toric coordinates .",
    "two hamiltonian operators are shown to exist ; one consists only of differential terms , and the other both of differential and functional ones . in sec.3.2",
    "we first quantize the constrained system in cartesian coordinates , and transform the coordinates to the toric afterwards .",
    "it is found that the momentum operator becomes hermitian or not , depending on the stage at which we impose the constraint condition on the system .",

    "a preferable quantum hamiltonian for a particle constrained on a torus has been obtained .    in quantum theory , to express the momentum operators in coordinate representation and to have the schrdinger equation , the commutators of canonical variables play an essential role .",
    "the commutators ( [ eqn:66])([eqn:68 ] ) in the cartesian coordinate system are much complicated .",
    "therefore , it is very difficult to obtain the coordinate representation of the momentum operators in this system .",
    "using the toric coordinate system enables us to have simple commutators and represent the momentum operators as operators in coordinate space .",
    "although the toric coordinate system defined by eq.([eqn:22 ] ) has a restriction @xmath131 , it is adequate to deal with the constrained system of a particle on the torus . with this coordinate system",
    "we have two hamiltonians eqs.([eqn:63 ] ) and ( [ eqn:65 ] ) , the former with qmp and the latter without qmp . with which hamiltonian ( [ eqn:44 ] ) or ( [ eqn:64 ] ) we start , in momentum representation , gives rise to this difference .    in quantum theory , the order that we first make a coordinate transformation then restrict the system under some constraint conditions , or vice versa , gives a great influence on the resultant theory .",
    "we conclude , in this paper , that , under the condition @xmath129 , the point transformations ( [ eqn:74 ] ) and ( [ eqn:75 ] ) are quite misleading .",
    "we must first transform the hamiltonian into the form shown in eq.([eqn:84 ] ) , then afterwards restrict it to the constraint condition @xmath129 .",
    "we thus have a preferable quantum hamiltonian eq.([eqn:85 ] ) .",
