    "observations of clusters at high redshift ( @xmath4 ) can directly constrain cosmological models , but searches based on colors or narrow band emission have not discovered more than a handful of presumed cluster galaxies ( le fvre et al .  1996 ; cowie & hu 1998 ) .",
    "there are several indications that powerful radio galaxies at high redshift ( hzrgs ) are located at the centers of forming clusters . the powerful radio galaxy 1138@xmath0262 has extensively been studied and there is strong evidence that it is a forming brightest cluster galaxy in a ( proto-)cluster ( e.g.  pentericci et al .",
    "the arguments include ( i ) the very clumpy morphology of 1138@xmath0262 as observed by the hst ( pentericci et al .",
    "1998 ) , reminiscent of a merging system ; ( ii ) the extremely distorted radio morphology and the detection of the largest radio rotation measures ( @xmath3 6200 rad m@xmath5 ) in a sample of more than 70 hzrgs , indicating that 1138@xmath0262 is surrounded by a hot and dense magnetized medium ( carilli et al .  1997 ) ; ( iii ) the detection of extended x - ray emission around 1138@xmath0262 ( carilli et al .  1998 ) , indicating the presence of hot cluster gas .",
    "with the aim of detecting  emitting cluster galaxies , the field of 1138@xmath0262 was observed on april 12 and 13 1999 with fors1 on the vlt antu using a narrow band ( 65  ) covering the redshifted ly@xmath6 ( 3814  ) , and the broad b band which encompasses the narrow band .",
    "the resulting  image shows a huge ( @xmath3 160 kpc)=50 km s@xmath7mpc@xmath7 and a deceleration parameter of @xmath8=0.5 . ]",
    "halo of ionized hydrogen around the galaxy , which extends even further than the radio emission .    from a combined  and b band image",
    "we have extracted @xmath3 1600 sources with sextractor ( bertin & arnouts , 1996 ) , after a careful consideration of the aperture size to be used for the photometry .",
    "objects , that are detected in the narrow band image at a level 3@xmath9 higher than expected from the broad band image , are selected as candidate  emitters . discarding 6 bright stars ,",
    "we detect 34 such objects in the 3@xmath103 mpc@xmath11 field with a range of  fluxes from 0.1 - 5@xmath12 ergs s@xmath7 cm@xmath5 .",
    "these are obvious candidates for being companion galaxies in the cluster around 1138@xmath0262 .",
    "three of these candidates are shown in fig .  1",
    ". the next step will be to measure the redshifts of the  emitters and subsequently determine the spatial correlation function and the velocity dispersion , which together with the size of the cluster will give a direct estimate of the total mass .",
