    "the stability criterion for dynamical shear instability is the richardson criterion : @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the horizontal velocity , @xmath4 the vertical coordinate and @xmath5 the brunt - visl frequency . using this criterion ,",
    "the timescale of the instability is the dynamical timescale and the instability is called dynamical shear instability ( endal & sofia 1978 ) . if heat losses are accounted for in @xmath6 ( maeder 1997 ) , the timescale is the thermal timescale and in that case the instability is called secular shear instability .",
    "the critical value , @xmath7 , is used by most authors as the limit for the occurrence of the dynamical shear .",
    "however , recent studies ( canuto 2002 ; brggen & hillebrandt 2001 ) show that turbulence may occur as long as @xmath8 .",
    "+ different formulae for the corresponding diffusion coefficient , @xmath9 , are used at the present time ( zahn 1992 ; maeder 1997 ; heger et al 2000 ; brggen & hillebrandt 2001 ) . the following dynamical shear diffusion coefficient suggested by j .- p .",
    "zahn is used in this study :    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the mean radius of the zone where the instability occurs , @xmath12 is the variation of @xmath13 over the zone and @xmath14 is the extent of the zone .",
    "the zone is the reunion of consecutive shells where @xmath15 .",
    "this is valid if the peclet number , @xmath16 .",
    "+ the computer model used is the geneva evolutionary code",
    ". modifications ( to be described in a future paper ) have been made to study the advanced stages of the evolution of massive stars .",
    "the models are calculated for 3 stars of 15 @xmath0 at @xmath17 with @xmath18 km / s .",
    "convective stability is determined by the schwarzschild criterion .",
    "the overshooting parameter , @xmath19 for h and he  burning and 0 afterwards .",
    "in the first model , the dynamical shear was not included .",
    "then one model was calculated with @xmath20 and one with @xmath21 .",
    "the calculations reached shell o  burning .",
    "note that the computer model includes secular shear and meridional circulation for any calculation .",
    "the characteristic timescale of the dynamical shear is very short ( a fraction of a year ) throughout evolution when using equation ( 1 ) .",
    "we obtain diffusion coefficients between @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xmath24/s .",
    "this is usually 1 or 2 orders of magnitude larger than the dynamical shear diffusion coefficients of brggen & hillebrandt ( 2001 ) or heger et al ( 2000 ) .",
    "however , the extent of the unstable zone is very small , a few @xmath25 so the shear mainly smoothens the sharp @xmath13gradients but does not transport angular momentum over long distances",
    ". the total angular momentum of our models , at the beginning and at the end of the calculations are of the same order of magnitude as the values obtained by heger et al ( 2000 ) in their models e15 and e15b .",
    "although dynamical shear strengthens convection , especially the he  burning convective shell , the structure and the convective zones are similar between the model without dynamical shear and the one with dynamical shear and @xmath7 . concerning the richardson criterion , we see that there is a difference during ne  burning between the model using @xmath7 and @xmath26",
    ". indeed , using the latter , there is another large c  burning convective shell while the central convective core is smaller .",
    "one could argue that our diffusion coefficient is too high but we obtained a similar trend using the diffusion coefficient of brggen & hillebrandt ( 2001 ) with @xmath26 .",
    "the well known discrepancy between the observed and predicted pulsar rotation periods might be reduced with the interaction between rotation and magnetic field ( see contributions by heger and spruit in this volume ) or with a formula linking dynamical and secular shear in the advanced stages of the evolution of massive stars .",
