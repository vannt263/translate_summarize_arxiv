    "investigating the formation of terrestrial planets outside of the solar system can give insight into the origin of the earth - moon system and whether similar planetary system architectures form around other stars .",
    "the study of extra - solar terrestrial planet formation must currently be carried out through indirect searches for the dusty aftermath of formation events . since the dust",
    "is located in the terrestrial planet zone , it will have temperatures of @xmath0300 k and will emit most of its thermal radiation at @xmath010 @xmath1 m .",
    "stars actively undergoing terrestrial planet formation will have substantial amounts of warm dust orbiting in their terrestrial planet zones and will thus show mid - infrared emission in excess of what one would expect from the star alone . properly establishing the age of such mid - infrared excess systems",
    "is necessary for comparison with expectations from planet formation theories and simulations .",
    "we were alerted to excess mid - infrared emission around the star hd 15407a through a paper entitled `` detection of silica dust in the debris disk around hd 15407 '' presented at an october 2009 spitzer meeting by h. fujiwara ( e. becklin , personal communication 2009 ) . at this meeting",
    ", the age for hd 15407a was suggested to be @xmath02 gyr .",
    "we felt this age could be in error , and initiated our own follow - up observations to independently constrain hd 15407a s age .",
    "here we report these observations , our revised value for the age of the hd 15407 binary system , and a discussion of terrestrial planet zone collisions around adolescent solar mass stars .",
    "both components of the hd 15407 system were observed in cloudy conditions at mauna kea observatory with the keck  i telescope and hires echelle spectrometer @xcite . with the hires red collimator wavelengths between 4680 and 8700   were covered at a resolution of 50,000 ( as determined from the fwhm of single thar arclines ) . the final signal - to - noise ratio per pixel , measured at 6700  , is 350 for hd 15407a and 200 for hd 15407b .",
    "spectral data were reduced and extracted using both the _ makee _ software package and standard iraf tasks and echelle reduction procedures .",
    "our star of interest , hd 15407a , is part of a visual double star system .",
    "table [ tabpars ] contains information about hd 15407a , the dusty primary star , and hd 15407b , the secondary component of the hd 15407 system . for both stars we employ line - depth ratios to roughly determine absolute temperature and , for hd 15407b , luminosity .",
    "those interested in the details of determining such parameters are referred to @xcite .",
    "we deduce that hd 15407a has a temperature similar to that of an f5-type star ; its broad - band colors ( bvijhk@xmath2 ) are in agreement with this temperature class determination .",
    "this suggests that hd 15407a is not significantly reddened by its circumstellar material and we adopt a temperature class of f5@xmath31 subclass .",
    "spectral analysis suggests that hd 15407b is a dwarf star with a temperature class of k3@xmath31 subclass and an effective temperature of 4600 k. broad - band colors for hd 15407b instead suggest that this dwarf star has an earlier spectral type of k0-k1 .",
    "we adopt a spectral type of k2  v with an uncertainty of @xmath31 temperature subclass .",
    "excess infrared emission is detected towards hd 15407a by iras in the 12 and 25 @xmath1 m bands @xcite .",
    "archival spitzer irs spectroscopy of hd 15407a ( aor 26122496 , pi fujiwara ) confirms the excess ( see figure [ figirex ] ) .",
    "we note the presence of solid state dust emission features in the irs spectrum .",
    "figure [ figdusty ] compares the irs spectrum of hd 15407a with those of other stars that host substantial quantities of terrestrial planet zone dust .",
    "we defer quantitative analysis of these spectral features to later publications .    to estimate the dust temperature and the fraction of the stellar luminosity reradiated by the dust ( @xmath4=l@xmath5/l@xmath6 ) we fit optical and near - infrared measurements out to k@xmath2-band with a synthetic stellar atmosphere spectrum @xcite and a blackbody to model the dust excess ( see figure [ figirex ] ) . in this way we find that the fraction of stellar light reradiated by the circumstellar dust is @xmath05.7@xmath710@xmath8 and that the grains radiate with a blackbody temperature of @xmath0500 k. such grains will reside at a distance of @xmath00.8 au from hd 15407a .",
    "we note that both the irs spectrum and an iras upper limit at 60 @xmath1 m of 347 mjy ( 4@xmath9 ) suggest that there is no cold dust orbiting hd 15407a .      to determine the age of the binary system we obtained and analyzed high - resolution echelle spectra for both stars and searched for x - ray detections in the literature . from these data we estimate the system age from the lithium content in the stellar photospheres , velocity widths of absorption lines , galactic space motion , and chromospheric activity ; details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the lithium 6710   absorption feature is strongly detected in the spectra of both stars ( table [ tabpars ] and figure [ figlith ] ) .",
    "lithium content in a stellar atmosphere is mainly determined by the star s age and mass .",
    "these strong detections are consistent with roughly solar mass stars of @xmath030 - 100 myr age ( see figure [ figlith ] ) .",
    "we note that the lithium equivalent width ( ew ) measured for hd 15407a ( @xmath094 m ) is significantly stronger than the range of li  i ews ( @xmath040 - 70 m ) quoted for similar spectral type pleiads in figure 3 ; this suggests that the hd 15407 system may be younger than pleiades cluster stars .",
    "the rosat all - sky survey ( rass ) detected x - ray emission from hd 15407b .",
    "analysis of this x - ray emission ( table [ tabpars ] and figure [ figxray ] ) suggests a star of @xmath0100 myr age @xcite .",
    "we note that @xcite claim a detection of hd 15407a by the rass . upon further investigation",
    ", it is revealed that the putative detection has an angular separation of @xmath105@xmath11 from hd 15407a , well outside the rass positional uncertainties .",
    "we conclude that hd 15407a was not detected by rosat .",
    "we estimate an upper limit for its fractional x - ray luminosity in the following manner : hd 15407b is detected by rosat with @xmath04@xmath9 significance .",
    "we take this level of x - ray flux as our upper limit for hd 15407a .",
    "thus , we derive the upper limit to hd 15407a s fractional x - ray luminosity by scaling hd 15407b s fractional x - ray luminosity by the ratio of the two star s total luminosities .",
    "this upper limit is reported in table [ tabpars ] and plotted in figure [ figxray ] where it is shown to be consistent with stars of @xmath0100 myr age .",
    "velocities of the hd 15407 system toward the center of our milky way galaxy , around the galactic center , and perpendicular to the galactic plane ( u , v , w ) are calculated from table [ tabpars ] sky positions and proper motions , the hipparcos measured distance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* where we assume hd 15407a and b are bound as is suggested by their common proper motions and the optical echelle measured radial velocities , see table [ tabpars ] ) , and heliocentric radial velocities .",
    "uvw is computed for each component of the hd 15407 system and these two results are averaged together to produce the values reported in table [ tabpars ] .",
    "comparison of these computed uvw space motions to those of known nearby stellar associations ( see figure [ figlith ] and e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) suggests that the hd 15407 system is a member of the ab dor moving group ( uvw@xmath0@xmath128 , @xmath1227 , @xmath1214 km s@xmath13 ) . the distance to the hd 15407 system and its position in the plane of the sky are consistent with it being a member of the ab dor moving group ( e.g. , see table 5 of * ? ? ?",
    "age estimates for the ab dor moving group range from @xmath050 - 120 myr ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "based on the above analysis , we suggest a best estimate age for the hd 15407 system of @xmath080 myr with a conservative range of plausible ages from 60 - 120 myr .",
    "we note that the measured @xmath14sin@xmath15 for hd 15407bsin@xmath15 for both stars was measured from the full - width at half - maximum depth ( fhwm ) of single absorption lines in the keck hires spectra ; the intrinsic fwhm resolution for the hires setup used was @xmath06 , a value we subtract in quadrature from the fwhm measured in the spectra when determining @xmath14sin@xmath15 ( see equation 6 in * ? ? ?",
    "] , @xmath04 , is surprisingly low for a star of such age and spectral type ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) ; it is possible that we view hd 15407b in a pole - on geometry .",
    "here we use our age estimate for the hd 15407 system to help constrain the era of rocky planet formation in the terrestrial planet zone around stars of solar mass .",
    "we consider stars with fractional infrared luminosities @xmath4@xmath160.01 as very dusty and likely to have undergone a recent collision between two planetary embryos or planets such as that postulated to have formed earth s moon .",
    "@xcite considered this problem , but included the very dusty g - type star bd+20 307 in their analysis .",
    "subsequent to their paper , it was discovered that bd+20 307 is an old main sequence star and hence its circumstellar dust is not related to terrestrial planet formation @xcite .",
    "@xcite and c. melis _",
    "et al . _  ( 2010 , in preparation ) have investigated `` intermediate mass '' stars ( spectral types late - b through early - f and masses from @xmath08 to @xmath01.5 m@xmath17 ) with large masses of warm dust in their terrestrial planet zones .",
    "the half dozen or so very dusty intermediate mass stars currently known have ages between 10 and 30 myr .",
    "this suggests that for such stars the era of most intense accretion of material onto rocky planets is over by about 30 myr .",
    "such a conclusion is similar to that drawn by @xcite who considered an ensemble of young intermediate mass stars but with only modest amounts of warm dust .",
    "we now show that the corresponding era for solar - mass stars , by contrast , lasts for @xmath0100 myr .    based on iras and spitzer surveys we are aware of four adolescent solar - type stars with @xmath4@xmath160.01 : ab dor member hd 15407a ( this paper ) ; pleiades member hd 23514 @xcite ; m47 member p1121 @xcite ; and ngc 2547 member id8 @xcite .",
    "the ages of these stars range between 35 myr ( ngc 2547 ) and about 100 myr ( the other 3 stars ) .",
    "interestingly , two of the four young , very dusty sun - like stars mentioned above are in wide binary systems ( hd 23514 , d. rodriguez _ et al . _",
    "2010 in preparation ; hd 15407 , this work ) .",
    "the other two systems ( id8 and p1121 ) have not been exhaustively searched for binary companions ; confirmation of any such binarity would be suggestive ( although still in the realm of statistics of small numbers ) of a link between binarity and catastrophic terrestrial planet collisions .",
    "we note the relative absence of similar numbers of warm dust stars with ages from @xmath0200 to 800 myr .",
    "no stars in four stellar associations with ages in this range @xmath12 the hyades @xcite , praesepe @xcite , carina - near @xcite , and ursa major @xcite @xmath12 have substantial quantities of warm dust in their terrestrial planet zone .",
    "together these four groups contain @xmath0200 solar - type stars . in the field , iras has surveyed many more stars with ages of @xmath0200 to 800 myr compared to the 30 to 100 myr range , yet none in the former age range have been identified with luminous warm dust .",
    "we estimate the frequency of catastrophic accretion events during rocky planet formation in the terrestrial planet zone by considering the detection rate of very dusty stars in the field and in young clusters .",
    "very dusty nearby field stars were better investigated in the all - sky iras survey than with spitzer s pointed capabilities . as noted by @xcite ,",
    "iras could have detected a main sequence dwarf with @xmath4@xmath160.01 and spectral type between f4 and k0 out to about 150 pc .",
    "there are 400 or so such field stars with ages @xmath0100 myr that iras could have detected , but of these , only hd 15407a has sufficient dust to actually have been detected by iras .",
    "similarly , among the young clusters studied with spitzer @xmath12 ngc 2232 @xcite , m47 @xcite , ngc 2547 @xcite , ic 2391 @xcite , and the pleiades @xcite @xmath12 the three very dusty cluster stars listed previously represent about one solar - type star in 200 ( roughly consistent with the determination for solar - type cluster stars by * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the high @xmath4 warm dust phenomenon manifests itself at about one adolescent solar - type star in 300 .",
    "if all f4-k0 stars display this phenomenon as adolescents , then the lifetime of the phenomenon at a typical sun - like star is about 300,000 years .    to understand this frequency of the warm dust phenomenon we consider a dust production model similar to that described by @xcite for hd 23514 .",
    "@xcite analyzed existing observations through october 2007 with the aid of a model of colliding planetary embryos due to c. agnor and e. asphaug @xcite and earlier researchers .",
    "the idea is that following a catastrophic collision of two rocky planetary embryos or planets , fragmented debris covering a range of sizes goes into orbit around a central star .",
    "@xcite assumed that collisions between debris would be frequent enough to establish an equilibrium size distribution where the number of particles of radius `` @xmath18 '' is proportional to @xmath19 . in this situation ,",
    "both the mass carried by particles of radius @xmath18 and the collision time are proportional to the square root of @xmath18 .",
    "most of the mass is carried by large fragments while small particles are responsible for most of the excess infrared luminosity and collide the fastest .",
    "the radius of the smallest dust particles in orbit around a very dusty star is set by radiative blowout and , for hd 15407a , will be @xmath01 @xmath1 m . the collision time for",
    "such particles will be about 1 year divided by 10@xmath7l@xmath5/l@xmath6 or @xmath010 years .",
    "if the largest initial fragments of a catastrophic collision have radii @xmath0100 m , then their collisional lifetime is @xmath0100,000 years which is within a factor of 3 of the lifetime ( estimated in the previous paragraph ) required if all solar - type stars are forming rocky planets in their terrestrial planet zone .",
    "should the formation of rocky terrestrial planets involve more than a single catastrophic collision , then the model - estimated warm dust phenomenon lifetime could be more than 100,000 years at each sun - like star . as noted by @xcite , the total mass lost over this interval of time @xmath12 due to a collisional cascade followed by radiative blowout @xmath12",
    "will be about the mass of earth s moon .",
    "based on keck hires optical spectroscopy , x - ray flux , and galactic uvw space motions we estimate the age of the hd 15407 binary system to be @xmath080 myr and identify the system as likely belonging to the ab dor moving group .",
    "collecting the full sample of known very dusty debris - disk hosting stars , we find that the era of final catastrophic mass accretion for rocky planets around stars of roughly solar mass occurs later than around intermediate mass stars . provided that rocky planet formation in the terrestrial planet zone of most solar mass stars is accompanied by at least one and possibly a few catastrophic collisions of planet - size objects within a 100 myr interval , then the detection rate and age range of very dusty solar - type stars @xmath12 observed to be about one in 300 for ages between 30 and 100 myr @xmath12 can be accounted for .",
    "our conclusion is that existing observations of such dusty stars indicates that most sun - like stars are accompanied by rocky planets in the terrestrial planet zone and that collisions among such forming planets will occur , as is expected in theoretical simulations of planetary origins .",

    "<S> the incidence of the warm dust phenomenon , when compared against models for the formation of rocky terrestrial - like bodies , implies that rocky planet formation in the terrestrial planet zone around sun - like stars is common . </S>"
