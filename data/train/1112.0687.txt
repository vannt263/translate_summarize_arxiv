    "in this paper , we compute matrices of the adjacent transpositions @xmath1 in @xmath0 for all of young s natural representations .",
    "these representations are irreducible and any other irreducible representation is equivalent to one of young s natural representations .",
    "moreover , the adjacent transpositions generate all of @xmath0 so that all the matrices of young s natural representations are easily obtained by merely multiplying the appropriate generators .",
    "there are two key ideas employed in these calculations .",
    "the first is that partitions of @xmath2 correspond to irreducible representations of @xmath0 .",
    "each partition is represented graphically by a ferrer s diagram .",
    "@xmath3 @xmath4 so there are five ( inequivalent ) irreducible representations of @xmath0 .",
    "the second key idea is that given a partition of @xmath2 , and hence a shape @xmath5 , the dimension of representation module corresponding to the shape @xmath5 , or the degree of the corresponding representation matrices , is equal to the number of standard fillings of the shape @xmath5 , denoted @xmath6 .",
