    "in the framework of the colour dipole model [ 1,2 ] and in the high - colour limit @xmath7 , the scattering on a heavy nucleus is exactly described by the sum of fan diagrams constructed of bfkl pomerons , each of them splitting into two .",
    "numerical solutions of the resulting equation for the colour dipole cross - section on the nucleus [ 3 - 9 ] were first presented in [ 8 ] , and then in [ 10 - 14 ] . the gluon density introduced in [ 8 ] revealed a `` supersaturation '' behaviour , tending to zero at any fixed momentum @xmath8 as the rapidity @xmath9 . as a function of @xmath10 it proved to have a form of a soliton wave moving to the right with a constant velocity as @xmath11 increases .",
    "this latter phenomenon is related to its scaling property : at high enough @xmath11 the gluon density at fixed impact parameter @xmath12 proved to be a function of the ratio @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , the position in momentum space of the maximum of the gluon density , can be interpreted as a `` saturation momentum '' growing as a power of energy .",
    "subsequent numerical calculations [ 10,14 ] confirmed this scaling behaviour , although the gluon density itself is defined differently by different authors .",
    "obviously partonic densities in the nucleus are not observable themselves but are only certain theoretical tools to calculate the observable quantities",
    ". therefore different definitions of the gluonic density are well admissible , provided they lead to the same observables .",
    "as such the structure function of the nucleus is the most directly calculable one .",
    "it was first calculated in [ 8 ] from the found solution of the bfkl fan diagram equation for a very wide range of energies ( up to rapidities @xmath15 ) , for the nucleus in the form of a spherical well and for a rather specific colour distribution inside the nucleon , not adapted to the experimental data .",
    "the found structure function proved to be rising as @xmath11 with rapidity and roughly linearly with @xmath16 in agreement with the theoretical expectations [ 7,11 ] .",
    "later calculations with a more realistic nuclear density [ 15 ] revealed that the nuclear structure function in fact grows as @xmath17 , the extra growth provided by the contribution of peripheral collisions not damped by the non - linear term in the evolution equation .",
    "still the attention in both [ 8 ] and [ 15 ] was centered at the asymptotic behaviour at high energies , insensitive to the choice of the initial conditions and governed only by the internal dynamics of the evolution equation .",
    "however , from the experimental point of view it is desirable to know the structure function at values of @xmath0 accessible now or in the near future ( see e.g. [ 16 ] ) , say down to @xmath18 corresponding to @xmath19 . at such rapidities",
    "the influence of the initial condition is still rather noticeable so that its choice becomes a matter of importance .",
    "accordingly we performed a new run of calculations employing more realistic colour distributions in the proton , following from the saturation approach of [ 17 ] consistent with dis data for the proton below @xmath1 which explicitly contain saturation in the form of multiple scattering and also describe the experimental data for the proton , could be used , see [ 19 ] for a study of saturation in the low @xmath16 region within this multiple scattering model .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the use of [ 17 ] due to technical reasons , see section 3 . ] . in [ 10 ] the parton distributions following from this initial condition were studied . in this paper",
    "we report on the nuclear structure function following from the bfkl fan diagram evolution equation with physically supported initial conditions .",
    "the solution of this equation also allows us to find the gluon density in the nucleus .",
    "we use it to study another directly measurable quantity : the inclusive probability for heavy flavour production off nuclei ( by photon - gluon fusion ) in photon induced reactions .",
    "in this section we collect the formulae necessary to calculate the structure function from the solution of the bfkl fan diagram evolution equation .",
    "the nuclear structure function @xmath20 can be standardly defined via the cross - sections @xmath21 for the collision of the transversal ( @xmath22 ) or longitudinal ( @xmath23 ) virtual photon of momentum @xmath24 , @xmath25 , on the nucleus @xmath2 of momentum @xmath26 : f_2(x , q^2)=(_t+_l ) , [ eq1 ] where @xmath27 .",
