    "the roles of magnetic fluctuations and orbital ordering are at the center of a continuing debate in the field of iron - based superconductors ( febs ) .",

    "the discussion is often focused on an exclusive choice : either magnetic correlations @xcite or orbital fluctuations @xcite are the dominant factor .",
    "experimental evidence for nematic response was first obtained in the bafe@xmath3as@xmath3 system @xcite , where a structural transition that lowers the rotational symmetry from @xmath4 to @xmath5 is closely followed by antiferromagnetic ordering @xcite , with modulation wave vector @xmath6 .. when discussing experimental data , we will refer to a unit cell containing two fe atoms , in units of @xmath7 .",
    "] new interest has been generated by the recent observations of nematicity in fese @xcite , a superconducting compound that exhibits a symmetry - lowering structural transition but no magnetic order @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the observation of a temperature dependent splitting of @xmath8 and @xmath9 orbitals through angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopic ( arpes ) studies @xcite .    while several analyses have shown that it is possible to have a nematic response due to dynamic magnetic correlations alone @xcite , driving a transition to an orthorhombic phase @xcite with fluctuations alone is another matter . in any case",
    ", one might wonder to what extent the distinction between magnetic and orbital correlations is artificial .",
    "experimentally , there is no question that there are substantial instantaneous magnetic moments on fe sites in the febs compounds , both from x - ray emission spectroscopy @xcite and from neutron scattering @xcite , and that these moments are generally antiferromagnetically correlated @xcite , regardless of whether static order is observed . in particular , low - energy magnetic excitations about the @xmath6 wave vector have been observed in fese by neutron scattering @xcite .",
    "these observations are supported by theoretical calculations using dynamical mean field theory ( dmft ) @xcite . at the same time , a number of analyses have found that models consistent with the magnetic order also exhibit partial orbital ordering @xcite , involving broken degeneracy of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 orbitals . indeed , an energy splitting between bands of dominant @xmath8 and @xmath9 character has been observed @xcite over the same range of temperatures as anisotropies of the intensity of spin excitations @xcite .",
    "while fese has garnered a lot of attention , fete@xmath0se@xmath1 in the regime of optimal superconducting transition temperature ( @xmath10 ) is also rather interesting .",
    "although the average crystal structure remains tetragonal , elastoresistance measurements demonstrate a strong nematic response in the @xmath11 symmetry channel that appears to diverge at low temperature , similar to other optimally - doped fe - pnictide superconductors @xcite , as reproduced in fig .  [",

    "furthermore , there is an evidence of the local c@xmath12 symmetry breaking down to c@xmath3 in the pattern of short - range dynamical magnetic correlations measured by neutron scattering in parent material fete with s , or se doping , and also on cooling in a composition that is superconducting  @xcite , while arpes measurements at 25  k indicate a splitting of the @xmath13 and @xmath14 bands at zone center @xcite .",
    "the coherence of the charge carriers also shows a strong temperature dependence : optical conductivity measurements find a component that becomes coherent only at low temperature , with the inverse of the energy width growing on cooling @xcite .     for @xmath15 ( dashed line ) @xcite , inverse scattering rate of the narrow drude component from optical conductivity measurements of @xmath16 ( open squares ) @xcite , and the ratio of 7-mev magnetic spectral weight integrated about the spin - stripe wave vector @xmath17 and the double - stripe wave vector @xmath18 ( filled circles connected by solid line ) , taken from fig .",

    "the bond angles are essentially controlled by the height of the chalcogenide ions above and below the fe layers , with the bond angle dropping from 104@xmath21 in fese to @xmath22 in fe@xmath23te @xcite .",
    "it was argued @xcite that the change in height of the chalcogenide ions modifies the relative magnitudes of superexchange couplings ( although the concept of superexchange is not well defined for multi - orbital febs with a high degree of itinerancy @xcite ) , resulting in a change of the characteristic antiferromagnetic wave vector from that describing the double - stripe @xmath24 order known to occur in fe@xmath23te @xcite , to that of the dynamical single - stripe @xmath6 correlations in superconducting fete@xmath0se@xmath1 @xcite .",

    "the pattern observed here at high temperature and in the non - superconducting sample is quite similar to that recently reported by one of us ( iz ) @xcite in a s - doped fete sample with filamentary superconductivity .",
    "there the pattern emerged upon cooling , replacing the high - temperature pattern characteristic of the parent fe@xmath23te @xcite , indicating a transition between two different spin - liquid states .",
    "the measured spin - spin correlations were described by a model in which a long - range spin pattern is broken into four - spin plaquettes , with exponential decay of correlations between plaquettes with distance from the central plaquette .",
    "the change in symmetry of the model plaquettes needed to simulate the measured inelastic diffuse scattering suggested local breaking of the c@xmath12 symmetry down to c@xmath3 on cooling , prior to reaching the superconducting state . in the present case , we find that the spin correlations at both high and low temperatures can be modeled with the same choice of plaquette ( having only c@xmath3 symmetry ) , but with the inter - plaquette correlations changing from the double - stripe to the single - stripe wave vector on cooling .",

    "we infer an associated change in both the crystal - field splitting and the hybridization of the @xmath33 states .",

    "we thus conclude that the change in the wave vector which describes propagation of magnetic correlations from @xmath28 to @xmath27 is a further necessary condition for superconductivity in 11 iron chalcogenides .    in our superconducting samples ,",
    "the modeling of * q * dependence of the low - energy magnetic scattering suggests local rotational symmetry breaking at all temperatures .",
    "however , it is the temperature - dependent change in characteristic magnetic wave vector that seems to qualitatively correlate with the growth in the nematic response of the elastoresistance measurements @xcite , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] .",
    "the variation in antiferromagnetic wave vector implies a relative change among the exchange couplings over various fe - fe neighbor distances .",
    "a likely cause of this change is a temperature dependent variation of the orbital overlaps , the corresponding hybridization , as well as the variation in the occupancies of fe @xmath96 levels .",
    "the arpes evidence for local splitting of @xmath13 and @xmath14 bands @xcite , together with the temperature - dependent nematic response @xcite , supports this sort of variation .",
    "our evidence for the thermal variation of the tetrahedral bond angle indicates a modification of the splitting , and hence the orbital content and the occupancy of the @xmath97 and @xmath34 based bands that cross the fermi level . regarding the question of what drives the nematic response",
    ", we can conclude that it is _ not _ an approach to magnetic order ; local orbital order is a more likely suspect .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that the magnetic , orbital , and lattice degrees of freedom are strongly entangled .",
    "we have also observed a reduction of low - energy magnetic spectral weight on cooling .",
    "this is consistent with nuclear magnetic resonance results for an @xmath87 sample in which the quantity @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the spin - lattice relaxation rate measured at the te site , decreases as the temperature is reduced @xcite .",
    "this loss of magnetic susceptibility is correlated with a growth in electronic conductivity @xcite and a crossover from incoherence to coherence .",
    "this correlation parallels the more extreme changes observed in fe@xmath23te @xcite .",
    "theoretically , a competition between antiferromagnetic correlations and conductivity is expected @xcite .",
    "the same electrons must contribute to the magnetic moments , influenced by coulomb and hund s interactions , and to electronic conductivity , minimizing kinetic energy .",
    "this balance adjusts on cooling , with changing hybridization , and this competition likely plays an important role in determining the superconducting state .",
    "altogether , there is evidence for temperature - correlated changes in characteristic magnetic wave vector , nematicity , electronic coherence , magnetic spectral weight , and tetrahedral bond angle",
    ". it would be surprising if there is not an underlying connection why all of these happen together , and the temperature - dependent orbital hybridization and the orbital - selective electronic coherence provide a plausible connection .",
    "these relationships certainly deserve further study .",

    "<S> it has recently been demonstrated that dynamical magnetic correlations measured by neutron scattering in iron chalcogenides can be described with models of short - range correlations characterized by particular choices of four - spin plaquettes , where the appropriate choice changes as the parent material is doped towards superconductivity . </S>",
    "<S> here we apply such models to describe measured maps of magnetic scattering as a function of two - dimensional wave vectors obtained for optimally superconducting crystals of fete@xmath0se@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the characteristic antiferromagnetic wave vector evolves from that of the bicollinear structure found in underdoped chalcogenides ( at high temperature ) to that associated with the stripe structure of antiferromagnetic iron arsenides ( at low temperature ) ; these can both be described with the same local plaquette , but with different inter - plaquette correlations . </S>",
    "<S> while the magnitude of the low - energy magnetic spectral weight is substantial at all temperatures , it actually weakens somewhat at low temperature , where the charge carriers become more itinerant . </S>",
    "<S> the observed change in spin correlations is correlated with the dramatic drop in the electronic scattering rate and the growth of the bulk nematic response on cooling . finally , we also present powder neutron diffraction results for lattice parameters in fete@xmath0se@xmath1 indicating that the tetrahedral bond angle tends to increase towards the ideal value on cooling , in agreement with the increased screening of the crystal field by more itinerant electrons and the correspondingly smaller splitting of the fe @xmath2 orbitals . </S>"
