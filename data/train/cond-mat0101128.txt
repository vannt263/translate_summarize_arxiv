    "the problem of reunion of interacting random walkers appears in many situations , directly or in disguise , such as e.g. , in situations involving one - dimensional stringlike objects such as interfaces , steps on surfaces , in one - dimensional quantum problems , in several types of polymer problems , wetting , etc .",
    "the issue quite often is the large - length scaling of the partition function of reunion ( or survival ) of a set of walkers all starting , say , at origin . for a purely short range repulsive",
    "interaction , this is the problem of `` vicious walkers . ''",
    "many of the vicious - walker reunion and survival exponents are known from exact calculations in one dimension@xcite , the renormalization - group ( rg ) approach@xcite for general dimensions , and lattice models in two dimensions@xcite .",
    "recent studies of phase transitions on vicinal or miscut surfaces@xcite required the scaling behavior of such partition functions in the presence of a long range interaction ( namely @xmath0 ) in addition to short range interactions .",
    "the effective interaction of steps on a vicinal surface has a long @xmath1 tail@xcite and recent studies on si(113 ) surfaces indicate the presence of an attractive short range interaction@xcite as well .",
    "similar long range interactions occur in the one - dimensional calogero - sutherland model@xcite of interacting quantum particles , and as the angular momentum term in higher - dimensional quantum problems . _",
    "the reunion and survival behaviors turn out to be the unifying feature in these wide varieties of problems_. these motivated us to study the scaling limit of various partition functions in the presence of long range interactions , especially @xmath1 .",
    "we use these results for studying phase transitions of polymers and then show how many results of quantum problems can be recovered from such an analysis .",
    "the success of the rg approach for short range interactions@xcite and the possibility of exact renormalization in the presence of long range interactions@xcite allowed us to use the renormalization - group approach for this problem .",
    "it is known that the probability distribution function for a random walker can be represented by the wiener integral , which as a path integral could , _ a la _ edwards , represent a polymer .",
    "any interaction of two or more walkers at the same time or step length would translate into an interaction among the polymers at the same contour length . for @xmath2-dimensional walkers",
    ", we would then get @xmath3-dimensional interacting directed polymers .",
    "we shall be using this polymer language throughout this paper .",
    "phase transitions in polymerlike systems by interactions at the same contour length occur , e.g. , in the case of steps already mentioned , in flux lines in superconductors@xcite , in melting and unzipping of dna@xcite , to cite a few .",
    "a directed polymer formulation then becomes quite natural . in this paper",
    ", our focus is mainly on the effect of the long range interaction on these phase transitions , recovering the results for the short range case as a special case .",
    "furthermore , we exploit the relation between polymers and quantum problems to show the importance of reunion behaviors in wide varieties of problems in various dimensions@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we recover several results known from exact solutions , illustrating how the reunion exponent armed with the renormalization group gives a unified approach to these problems .",

    "in conclusion , we have investigated the reunion of random walkers having both short range and long range interactions . by using a momentum - shell renormalization - group technique ,",
    "the reunion and survival exponents have been calculated .",
    "the exponent @xmath216 for polymers has been evaluated at the unbound phase and at the binding - unbinding transition point represented by the stable and the unstable fixed points , respectively , in the coupling constant space .",
    "the value of this exponent in the unbound phase is crucial in determining the nature of the binding - unbinding transition@xcite .",
    "this transition is critical for @xmath217 and first order with higher moments diverging for @xmath218 . since @xmath99 is explicitly dependent on the strength of the long range interaction @xmath38 , the order of the phase transition depends on this parameter .",
    "[ fig : dvsg ] . for example , at @xmath27 , the dimension more relevant in the context of the experimental observation of vicinal surfaces@xcite , one finds a first - order transition for @xmath177 and criticality for @xmath219 . in the quantum - mechanical picture , the different nature of the phase transition is reflected in the approach of the bound state to the zero - energy state as the short range part of the potential is tuned . for @xmath176",
    ", one can get the bound state arbitrarily close to the zero - energy state with a diverging length scale as the gap vanishes , whereas for the first - order case ( @xmath177 ) , the length scale remains finite . in the latter case ,",
    "it is possible to define diverging length scales from higher moments [ see eq . ( [ num ] ) ] .",
    "this one - dimensional case can further be extended to the case of a quantum particle subjected to a short range potential in dimensions @xmath147 with the centrifugal barrier playing the role of the long range potential .",
    "the fact that all the details and the nuances of the @xmath1 interaction problem known from exact solutions@xcite could be recovered in a unified manner via the reunion behavior lends credence to the general approach developed in this paper .",
    "our method can be used for other problems and interactions as well .",
    "in the noninteracting case , the survival partition function @xmath220 for gaussian walkers is unity .",
    "the anomalous exponent of @xmath11 in the survival partition function appears due to the interaction among the chains .",
    "the nontrivial contribution of this interaction is apparent from the one - loop @xmath59 term , which is shown in fig [ fig:1 ] .",
